      <li>I liked the old compact &amp; brush</li>

      <li>So if you have a little patience, it is a great cake eyeliner that you will love &amp; have for a very long time.</li>
      <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
      <li>only issue is that the brown color is really more of a brown-black.</li>
      <li>I went the cheaper route and bought this and got exactly what I paid for.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>First thing...</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I wanted when I ordered it</li>
      <li>Just prefer cake eyeliner over any other kind.</li>
      <li>Shipping time was reasonable &amp; the product is absolutely what I&#x27;ve been looking for--cake eyeliner is the way to go!</li>
      <li>Aside from that, I am satisfied and will be using this for as long as they manufacture it.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly, applies easily (although it takes a bit of practice as the brush is rather small) and gives a clean line.</li>
      <li>I really want a water&#x3D;based eye liner that is put on with a brush.  </li>
      <li>The teeny tiny brush makes a precise line.</li>
      <li>even smaller than the original.  </li>
      <li>I tried several times and got the same reply.--trying to make sure I was typing it correctly.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never used cake eyeliner before, I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Being a pale redhead, I do need more of a \\&quot;crayon brown.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply, but it is almost black</li>
      <li>It absorbs less &amp; less water and makes a more concentrated liquid to make a darker more solid line &amp; not something that looks transparent.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and react frequently to new products.</li>
      <li>My eyes are very sensitive, and this eyeliner does not bother my eyes.</li>
      <li>I have used this eyeliner for several years and it never fails.  </li>
      <li>Latest delivery of brown eyeliner is a solid mass that does not break down into &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; particles.</li>
      <li>The brush that comes with it is much too tiny--</li>
      <li>I really like this eyeliner and will continue to use it as long as they make it</li>
      <li>This eyeliner is terrific and is not messy.  </li>
      <li>This time I ordered the brown and the black cake eyeliners together and the black is fine.</li>
      <li>Ran, did not stay in place, not a good color for me either--too light.</li>
      <li>It washes off easily, yet remained on my lids for approximately fifteen (15) hours.</li>

<li> The bad part is that it is very moisture absorbing when you first get it.  </li>
<li> bought it for my travel case, as it will last long than bottled versions, which have to be thrown out after 3 or 6 months, because of bacterial contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I use washable mascara, and I expected that this eyeliner product that is mixed with water to apply would also be washable, but it is definitely long lasting.  </li>
<li> It lasts a long time</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time and should have looked on Amazon from the beginning.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one (not a gel) in stores for a long time but couldn&#x27;t find anything.</li>
<li> Not to mention that it lasts a really long time.  </li>
<li> The eyeline cake seems too dry</li>
<li> I got the brush really wet &amp; the cake soaked it up like a sponge.  </li>
<li> This cake eyeliner requires a brush that you wet</li>
<li> Wet your angle brush and really wet the product.</li>
<li> It can be controlled moreso than any other type.  </li>
<li> I am a chef and by the end of the night it is not all melted, like those other eyeliners.</li>
<li> Years ago when I started wearing makeup in the dark ages</li>
<li> I had to run down to Wallgreens and pay $6.00 for a brush.  </li>
<li> Then I was inspired to search for \\&quot;cake eyeliner\\&quot;  on Amazon, and up popped \\&quot;Cake Eyeliner from Fran Wilson\\&quot; in brown or black.  </li>
<li> I thought I&#x27;d try something new and less expensive.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product.  </li>
<li> Fran Wilson updated their product since the last time I purchased it, so I was a little wary.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very highly pigmented.  </li>
<li> Its hard to find cake liner these days</li>
<li> The brush enclosed was hard to use.  </li>
<li> Very hard to find this type of liner which I have always preferred.</li>
<li> I like cake eyeliner, but will be using this at the upper base of my upper lashes and probably not on the lower base of my lashes because I have been warned away from waterproof eye make-up by my ophthalmologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Even the expensive eyeliners I had issues</li>

    <li> I have ever used. I tightline with this and there is no melting/smudging/redness/tearing. It stays on and if it does fade, it does so in an unobtrusive manner--no raccoon eyes. Who knew something so inexpensive could be so fabulous?</li>
    <li> Fran Wilson updated their product since the last time I purchased it, so I was a little wary.  It was even better than the old one.  If you&#x27;ve never used cake eyeliner before, I highly recommend it.  It takes a little practice, but the best part is you can wipe it off and start over.  Not to mention that it lasts a really long time.  My mom and I both use this product and have for years.  It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Years ago when I started wearing makeup in the dark ages (I&#x27;m 62 now) I always used cake eyeliner because it is easy to apply and to control the line width and darkness.  As an added benefit, the eyeliner cake lasted for literally years.  To my chagrin, when I tried to replace my Clinique cake eyeliner it was no longer available, and I couldn&#x27;t find anything comparable in department stores or drug stores.  I was resigned to struggling with pencil or gel eyeliner products for some years.  Then I was inspired to search for \\&quot;cake eyeliner\\&quot;  on Amazon, and up popped \\&quot;Cake Eyeliner from Fran Wilson\\&quot; in brown or black.  Eureka!  I ordered a cake in brown and it is unfortunately just OK.  It is easy to apply, but it is almost black it is so dense, and it is very difficult to remove.  I use washable mascara, and I expected that this eyeliner product that is mixed with water to apply would also be washable, but it is definitely long lasting.  If you like to use eye makeup remover this would be the product for you!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years and recommend it to anyone who cannot use the pencils. Can alway get the right consistency and it stays on. It is great!</li>
    <li> Shipping time was reasonable &amp; the product is absolutely what I&#x27;ve been looking for--cake eyeliner is the way to go! It stays put until YOU take it off and there is no &#x27;pooling&#x27; of the eyeliner in the corner of the eye as well as no creasing or fading on the outside of the eye for cat lines!!!</li>
    <li> I am happy to have found this item on Amazon.  It lasts a long time and I thought because of that it went out of production.  It&#x27;s a very good quality item for people who prefer cake eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I went the cheaper route and bought this and got exactly what I paid for.  Tends to wear off quickly.  Sometimes its better to pay more when it comes to a good eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  By using it I can make a real thin line which doesn&#x27;t smear.  I don&#x27;t use the brush it comes with because I have my own, but their brush looks fine.</li>
    <li> Was very happy to find cake eyeliner online as the stores no longer sell it.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time and should have looked on Amazon from the beginning.  This eyeliner stays on all day and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Works great. Stays put, washes off easily. I use it with a very thin brush along lash line. Its hard to find cake liner these days and this is perfect.  Will buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different eyeliners, and each had its own problems. Even the expensive eyeliners I had issues with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyeliner I am very pleased with. It dries quickly, applies easily (although it takes a bit of practice as the brush is rather small) and gives a clean line. It washes off easily, yet remained on my lids for approximately fifteen (15) hours. My eyes are very sensitive, and this eyeliner does not bother my eyes. It is also well pigmented. It did not flake and it did not smudge (side note: I do use a lid primer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that the brown color is really more of a brown-black. Being a pale redhead, I do need more of a \\&quot;crayon brown.\\&quot; Aside from that, I am satisfied and will be using this for as long as they manufacture it.</li>
    <li> Was very happy to find this product.  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have used this eyeliner for several years and it never fails.  Stays on all day.  Not water-proof but I just use one that is when i go to the gym &amp; pool.  Great price, easy to apply, and well worth trying.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find this. I still have mine from 10 years ago and was afraid this type of liner no longer existed. I do not like the newer liners with the brush at the end of the cap, I do not have control and can&#x27;t get an even line. This eyeliner has always been my favorite. I am glad Fran Wilson decided to keep the brown shade available although it is not as popular as the black. Thank you Amazon for carrying it.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find this type of liner which I have always preferred.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner ever. I am a chef and by the end of the night it is not all melted, like those other eyeliners. The teeny tiny brush makes a precise line. I really like this eyeliner and will continue to use it as long as they make it</li>
    <li> Latest delivery of brown eyeliner is a solid mass that does not break down into &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; particles. I&#x27;ve ordered this in the past and it was perfect. This time I ordered the brown and the black cake eyeliners together and the black is fine. But something must have happened with the brown batch that affected its composition. Will not order Fran Wilson again because of this.</li>
    <li> This is my second Fran Wilson cake eyeliner.  They last forever!  The bad part is that it is very moisture absorbing when you first get it.  After you use it for awhile, wetting &amp; rewetting with your brush.  It absorbs less &amp; less water and makes a more concentrated liquid to make a darker more solid line &amp; not something that looks transparent.  So if you have a little patience, it is a great cake eyeliner that you will love &amp; have for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I like cake eyeliner, but will be using this at the upper base of my upper lashes and probably not on the lower base of my lashes because I have been warned away from waterproof eye make-up by my ophthalmologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my travel case, as it will last long than bottled versions, which have to be thrown out after 3 or 6 months, because of bacterial contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the look of it, though, therefore the 4-star rating.</li>
    <li> First thing...I liked the old compact &amp; brush Better.  But this gets the eyes lined the way I like it.  The eyeline cake seems too dry&lt;br /&gt;or maybe I should say too dense.  The brush that comes with it is much too tiny--even smaller than the original.  I had to run down to Wallgreens and pay $6.00 for a brush.  I got the brush really wet &amp; the cake soaked it up like a sponge.  End result. I liked the way my&lt;br /&gt;eyes were lined.  I would reccomend it to a friend with these suggestions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Clinique brown cake eyeliner for 30-some years.  I thought I&#x27;d try something new and less expensive.  I was disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very highly pigmented.  The color when applied is more beige than brown.  I use it on days when I&#x27;m just knocking around the house.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product.  Your brush will soak up this cake eyeliner like a sponge.  Didn&#x27;t stay on and flaked like crazy.  Always remember \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;, and this eyeliner is a perfect example.  Didn&#x27;t even come close to the quality and application of the now discontinued Maybelline and Mary Kay eyeliners.  Great customer service, however.</li>
    <li> Bought this before.  This one is for a friend.</li>
    <li> This cake eyeliner requires a brush that you wet then you moisten the cake liner with the moist brush.  This eyeliner is terrific and is not messy.  It goes on smooth and looks really beautiful.  It is exactly what I wanted when I ordered it and I bought 3 packages so that I would always have it.  I like a good eyeliner but this beats out the liquid brands.  It is a perfect eyeliner that goes nicely and stays where you put it.  It is easy to correct with a&lt;br /&gt;q-tip if you smear it.</li>
    <li> Ran, did not stay in place, not a good color for me either--too light. I really want a water&#x3D;based eye liner that is put on with a brush.  The brush enclosed was hard to use.  I wanted to return it but got a reply from Beauty something--not Amazon.  When I tried to find out the details this website said I was using an incorrect email address and they could not respond to my email.  I tried several times and got the same reply.--trying to make sure I was typing it correctly.  I only have one emaill address and always have had only onel They provided a phone number but I was leaving on vacation and did not have time to further pursue the return.  I will never beauty products again,</li>
    <li> Cake eyeliner takes practice.  I have been using cake eyeliner for decades. The color is darker than Clinique brown. Wet your angle brush and really wet the product. get in right in the lash line.  It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t budge. It will come off with soap and water or mild makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner.  It can be controlled moreso than any other type.  Just prefer cake eyeliner over any other kind.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. I can easily adjust the color and thickness, just like in the &amp;#34;olden days&amp;#34; when everyone wore cake eyeliner. I&#x27;ve been looking for one (not a gel) in stores for a long time but couldn&#x27;t find anything. I have very sensitive skin and react frequently to new products. No reaction with this one!</li>
    <li> Cake eyeliner is a practiced craft, needing a steady hand and fine brush.  this eyeliner allows the artist to control the desired effect.</li>
