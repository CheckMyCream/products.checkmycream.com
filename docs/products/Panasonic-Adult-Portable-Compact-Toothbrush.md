      <li>Great portability and functionality.</li>
      <li>To my great surprise, five stars.</li>

      <li>, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>GREAT FOR SENSATIVE TEETH</li>
      <li>Great buy for the price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It looks very nice and maybe encourages users to take it along when otherwise they might not take a manual one, but that&#x27;s about all of the upside I can see.</li>
      <li>It looks very nice with its case.  </li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing a good job.</li>
      <li>Also I just don&#x27;t feel like it did as good a job cleaning teeth as the disposable electric Oral-B toothbrushes I have been using while traveling.</li>
      <li>I am used to the sonic brush and thought this one was a good alternative for travel.</li>
      <li>The size and shape ofthis makes it good for travel or on the go or when visiting friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It will do just as good a job.</li>
      <li>Good, not shaking too much, good price.</li>
      <li>However, I feel honor bound to review all the Amazon Vine products I try fairly, so I determined to continue using it.  </li>
      <li>Travel toothbrush is handy.  </li>
      <li>Vine reviews are akin to having company representatives on here, reviewing their own products.</li>
      <li>I have been using this Panasonic electric toothbrush for about a month, and have been thrilled with it...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice size to throw in the utility kit since use electric @</li>
      <li>confident Philips electric toothbrushes help with good oral hygiene.  </li>
      <li>Nice toothbrush to carry around with you with travel size toothpaste for brushing on the go.</li>
      <li>Ideal for travel and pretty effective.</li>
      <li>This is a nicely made compact toothbrush, twice the length of a tube of lipstick and an elegant design that looks nice in the purse and when you pull it out in the office bathroom to brush your teeth after lunch.</li>
      <li>so is suitable for men.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re all nice, well-meaning folks.  </li>
      <li>a good way to become familiar with the toothbrush is to brush without turning the power on.</li>
      <li>I wonder if Panasonic intends for it to have another personal use, as another one of their popular &#x27;massager&#x27; products, if you know what I mean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best use for this brush is a permanent spot in my purse to pull out on the go as its elegant case makes it convenient and easy to carry and you&#x27;d never guess it was a toothbrush not a makeup brush.</li>
      <li>It will be much more satisfying.</li>
      <li>For whitening use, a toothbrush with contours that reach into the nooks and crannies of the teeth help deliver the product where you need it the most.  </li>
      <li>Looks better than it performs.</li>
      <li>Then after you turn it on,  you have a better feel for</li>
      <li>I love the way my teeth feel after brushing with it.  </li>
      <li>simply put, it does a wonderful job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall recommended as a basic electronic toothbrush and is excellent for use together with whitening toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Any 5$ non electronic brush is better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>In some ways that&#x27;s good, as its great for traveling, but it feels very different compared to the spinbrush.</li>
      <li>Amazing deal was true.</li>
      <li>If this brush were to have some kind of dispenser, or even container, built in which would be equally compact and leak-proof, it could be a great seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>in all, a good purchase, and one I certainly do not regret, as it works great for my intended uses.</li>
      <li>Notice how most of the 4 and 5 star reviews are from people who got their&#x27;s FREE ....</li>
      <li>/&gt;Those looking for a full featured electronic tooth brush should look elsewhere as this particular one, though attractive, does not have timers or beepers.  </li>
      <li>Fits in my travel bag, love the cap that keeps the bristles covered, get&#x27;s my teeth clean...</li>
      <li>My mouth feels clean after each use and dental check-ups have never been better.  </li>
      <li>The vibrations don&#x27;t seem as strong as the Crest Spinbrush, but do seem to do the job.</li>
      <li>Panasonic does not vibrate as strongly as Sonicare.  </li>
      <li>It works fine</li>
      <li>the tooth brush case is great the brush head is a lot smaller</li>
      <li>Users will not see any toothpaste or toothbrush motion--just a buzzy sound.  </li>
      <li>It is however comfortable to use and carry.  </li>
      <li>light</li>
      <li>The brush is attractive, compact and has a nice case, and does not easily leak.  </li>
      <li>Plus it requires one AAA battery, although it seems to be very economical in its power use, even though it is a AAA battery.</li>
      <li>So when this Panasonic option became available, I was excited as it can be cumbersome to pack up the Sonicare while traveling (</li>
      <li>They now enjoy brushing tooth and keep them clean.</li>
      <li>My first instinct was to twist the top lid off, but that just opens the case to the battery compartment.  </li>
      <li>My teeth do feel clean afterwards, and that is what I expect from a toothbrush.</li>
      <li>although I do it as my teeth just don&#x27;t feel as clean without it.)&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;m not a dentist, I can&#x27;t say how much better this toothbrush is in terms of cleaning compared to another, but my experiences have been positive.</li>
      <li>Not much power, but the case is great for travel or just to put in your purse.</li>
      <li>As a result, it&#x27;s likely good for travel, if you care to take it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good size for a woman&#x27;s purse (not much bigger than a tube of mascara) or keeping in your desk at work.</li>
      <li>This Panasonic toothbrush is perfect for teeth whitening purposes as it has a nicely contoured head and does not have a timer or auto shut-off feature or beeper so that you can use it for as long or as little as needed.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more powerful than the cheap battery operated toothbrushes available at your local pharmacy, but not as powerful as my Sonicare ProResults.</li>
      <li>And although the vibration is pretty intense it doesn&#x27;t do such a great job on teeth like the Sonicare.</li>
      <li>I keep this in my purse in case of lunch emergencies :) its small and easy for a quick brush :)</li>
      <li>Works the same and nice to have the cover.</li>
      <li>I do not think this tooth brush is worth the price.</li>
      <li>Powerful vibration considering it&#x27;s size.</li>
      <li>of my favorite things about this toothbrush is the lipstick-like top, which keeps the brush clean whether traveling or at home, and I also love that it runs for a very long time on a single AAA battery.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so used to having that vibration when brushing, that it&#x27;s helped very much for when I&#x27;m out of town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bristles do not move, instead the tooth brush vibrates (&amp;#34;sonic vibrations&amp;#34;) and that provides &amp;#34;sonic brushstrokes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I use a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush on a daily basis, but wanted something more portable for travel.  </li>
      <li>The head is too compact for my liking and it seems this product was more geared for people with smaller mouths.  </li>
      <li>It is possible that it provides better results than brushing with a manual brush, but I cannot really feel that.  </li>
      <li>I had hoped this battery-powered toothbrush would be a good stand-in, but it is no better than manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice travel tooth brush, a little smaller than I thought but good enough for travel</li>
      <li>the product provides little or no mechanical up/down brush movement to provide or even assist effective cleaning.</li>
      <li>The real test is putting a dab of toothpaste on the brush and turning it on...outside your mouth.  </li>
      <li>the vibrations don&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>I found that one doesn&#x27;t really do much brushing, but a lot of changing positions and angles of approach.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer it to a manual toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Pull straight off to get to the tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Never did get to try it until it became available recently in the US.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was really reluctant to use it after it came.  </li>
      <li>, however I still expected more than a vibrating toothbrush, which is all that this is.</li>
      <li>This is much easier to carry while traveling rather than my rechargeable.</li>
      <li>It was not as I expected, but it is easy to carry.</li>
      <li>No complains but did wish there was a little more power.</li>
      <li>Maybe because my hands cannot vibrate anywhere near as fast as a powered toothbrush?</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Using the toothbrush\\&quot; instructions state that you brush as you normally do with a manual brush.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, however it feels just like a normal toothbrush you have to scrub around your mouth</li>
      <li>Especially, if you use the whitening mode of the Sonicare toothbrush which is pretty intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>You can get that same clean feeling with this Panasonic electric toothbrush too, but only if you brush well by hand.  </li>
      <li>The brush is somewhere between soft and medium, closer to soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the tooth brush case is great the brush head is a lot smaller then I expected, will have to buy larger head</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. Fits in my travel bag, love the cap that keeps the bristles covered, get&#x27;s my teeth clean...What else can I say?</li>
    <li> At home I use an oral B electric tooth brush and I got this to travel with. It in no way compares to the oral B, but for the price I guess i could not expect it would, however I still expected more than a vibrating toothbrush, which is all that this is. Now I am not claiming it does not work to break up plaque, however it feels just like a normal toothbrush you have to scrub around your mouth but this one vibrates.</li>
    <li> I guess I did not read the description of this product close enough. I assumed that as an electric tooth brush the bristles would move in an up and down motion. The bristles do not move, instead the tooth brush vibrates (&amp;#34;sonic vibrations&amp;#34;) and that provides &amp;#34;sonic brushstrokes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 3 stars because it is compact, it works (manually) brushing your teeth. It has a pleasing vibrating sensation on the teeth. I doubt I will use that last sentence ever again.</li>
    <li> Not much power, but the case is great for travel or just to put in your purse. Looks better than it performs.</li>
    <li> Why spend money on this? I bought this for traveling but the only word that describes it is USELESS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any 5$ non electronic brush is better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I like Panasonic brand but this is rubbish.</li>
    <li> It works fine but brush head is a bit small for an adult.  the battery vibration system is okey but really is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush on a daily basis, but wanted something more portable for travel.  I had hoped this battery-powered toothbrush would be a good stand-in, but it is no better than manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment.  I wish I could have read the Panasonic operating instructions before actually getting it.  Step five says it all, \\&quot;Brush by moving the toothbrush in the same way as when you brush by hand.\\&quot;  The real test is putting a dab of toothpaste on the brush and turning it on...outside your mouth.  Users will not see any toothpaste or toothbrush motion--just a buzzy sound.  Now try that with any Philips electric toothbrush--active bristle motion and toothpaste flying in all directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m confident Philips electric toothbrushes help with good oral hygiene.  My mouth feels clean after each use and dental check-ups have never been better.  You can get that same clean feeling with this Panasonic electric toothbrush too, but only if you brush well by hand.  Save yourself some money, and instead buy a dollar store toothbrush and travel cap.  It will do just as good a job.</li>
    <li> This is a nicely made compact toothbrush, twice the length of a tube of lipstick and an elegant design that looks nice in the purse and when you pull it out in the office bathroom to brush your teeth after lunch. It&#x27;s more powerful than the cheap battery operated toothbrushes available at your local pharmacy, but not as powerful as my Sonicare ProResults. Especially, if you use the whitening mode of the Sonicare toothbrush which is pretty intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to pack Sonicare for travel so I could use this brush for short travel. I&#x27;d most likely use the regular old toothbrush for extended travel as I find the handle on this brush too short and too thick to maneuver it comfortably around my mouth, especially to brush the back teeth. And although the vibration is pretty intense it doesn&#x27;t do such a great job on teeth like the Sonicare. I wonder if Panasonic intends for it to have another personal use, as another one of their popular &#x27;massager&#x27; products, if you know what I mean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best use for this brush is a permanent spot in my purse to pull out on the go as its elegant case makes it convenient and easy to carry and you&#x27;d never guess it was a toothbrush not a makeup brush. My dentist is going to be very happy!</li>
    <li> I keep this in my purse in case of lunch emergencies :) its small and easy for a quick brush :)</li>
    <li> Ideal for travel and pretty effective.</li>
    <li> This is a vibrating toothbrush that is almost totally useless. I can&#x27;t believe Panasonic has their name on it.</li>
    <li> great idea for traveling.</li>
    <li> Perfect for on the go</li>
    <li> Good, not shaking too much, good price.</li>
    <li> While I like using a regular toothbrush for regular brushing, I prefer and find that an electronic toothbrush increases the effectiveness of my expensive whitening toothpaste.  For whitening use, a toothbrush with contours that reach into the nooks and crannies of the teeth help deliver the product where you need it the most.  This Panasonic toothbrush is perfect for teeth whitening purposes as it has a nicely contoured head and does not have a timer or auto shut-off feature or beeper so that you can use it for as long or as little as needed.  another plus, is that this toothbrush is attractively designed with a matching cap that both protects the bristles during travel and hides the bristles from view.  When the cap is on, this toothbrush looks like an oversized tube of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those looking for a full featured electronic tooth brush should look elsewhere as this particular one, though attractive, does not have timers or beepers.  This does however have replacements heads available for separate purchase at prices on par with other basic toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall recommended as a basic electronic toothbrush and is excellent for use together with whitening toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Travel toothbrush is handy.  Makes excellent stocking stuffer, too.</li>
    <li> Amazing deal was true.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic portable EW-DS90 compact lightweight toothbrush *is* compact and lightweight. In fact, those are its best attributes. As a result, it&#x27;s likely good for travel, if you care to take it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, you&#x27;d be just as well off with a regular toothbrush.  The \\&quot;vibration\\&quot; mode seems to be simply a \\&quot;buzzing-type\\&quot; vibration - the product provides little or no mechanical up/down brush movement to provide or even assist effective cleaning. Any such brush motion needs to supplied by you, the user. And the actual brush head is quite small, actually a bit childlike for an \\&quot;adult\\&quot; brush. Although Panasonic is upfront about it, the brush does not come with a battery, so it&#x27;s not usable out of the box, a bit of an irritant. And there is no way to recharge the Panasonic - you just keep inserting batteries, as needed. A disappointment from a respected manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Greetings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually looked at a similar toothbrush two years ago after seeing a posting about it on Flyertalk, a forum for frequent travelers.  Never did get to try it until it became available recently in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive for a battery powered brush, but it does work very well, and could be something of a fashion accessory or necessity if one problem were addressed:  where to put the toothpaste.  The brush is attractive, compact and has a nice case, and does not easily leak.  If you were to leave it in your briefcase or purse, however, you still need the toothpaste which would come in a conventional container.  If this brush were to have some kind of dispenser, or even container, built in which would be equally compact and leak-proof, it could be a great seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it stands, the only advantages over a larger battery powered brush are its size and weight (about half the thickness and weight of an Oral-B portable brush).  Given my desire to save every ounce when traveling, I will include it in my shaving kit for flights.  Otherwise, it will not be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very small&lt;br /&gt;-Very light&lt;br /&gt;-looks &#x27;professional&#x27; and discrete&lt;br /&gt;-good power, comparable to a regular size battery powered brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-cost&lt;br /&gt;-no similar container for toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;-expensive heads</li>
    <li> I am used to the sonic brush and thought this one was a good alternative for travel. It works fine but you need to add some muscle work. the vibration of the brush is weak and that alone won&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> this is a no used product, just shake, like a vibrator , you know ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;may be .....he he he</li>
    <li> This is my first battery powered toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other battery powered toothbrushes. I can only compare it to manual toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrives in a cardboard Panasonic box, no shrink-wrap. A battery is NOT included. It takes one AAA battery. In addition to the toothbrush, there are four pieces of paper inside the cardboard box. One is the product registration, another is the warranty, another is a list of compatible accessories, and the last but not least is a 50-page small and wide instruction guide in four languages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush with the toothbrush cover and a battery inside weighs 1.5 around ounces. As such, it is just over six inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Using the toothbrush\\&quot; instructions state that you brush as you normally do with a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions also say that you put toothpaste on the toothbrush, put the toothbrush in your mouth, and then turn it on to prevent toothpaste from flying all over the place. When I read that, I was expecting toothpaste to be flying in all directions. But when I tried it, the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t even move or shake on the vibrating toothbrush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can feel the difference between using this and a manual toothbrush. Maybe because my hands cannot vibrate anywhere near as fast as a powered toothbrush? The brush is somewhere between soft and medium, closer to soft. My philosophy is to use multiple toothbrushes of different types, so if I have any blind spots or technique errors, the different toothbrush types can provide some backup. So this one is now part of my rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I discovered by accident, a good way to become familiar with the toothbrush is to brush without turning the power on. Then after you turn it on,  you have a better feel for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush cover has two grills for air to circulate and dry it out. If you leave it out overnight uncovered, it air dries by the next morning. The size and shape ofthis makes it good for travel or on the go or when visiting friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is decidedly more expensive than manual toothbrushes. The replacement heads currently go for $15 for a two pack. Plus it requires one AAA battery, although it seems to be very economical in its power use, even though it is a AAA battery.</li>
    <li> We use Sonicare brushes at home, and I expected a similar performance for this Panasonic toothbrush.  It is not so.  Panasonic does not vibrate as strongly as Sonicare.  It is however comfortable to use and carry.  It looks very nice with its case.  It is possible that it provides better results than brushing with a manual brush, but I cannot really feel that.  I do not think this tooth brush is worth the price.</li>
    <li> It was not as I expected, but it is easy to carry.</li>
    <li> Got 2 of these Panny EW-DS90-K battery powered toothbrushes for my kids when they travel.  They currently use the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes nightly at home and although these Panasonic toothbrushes are little lacking the power, it basically does the job for moving the brush around the teeth.  No complains but did wish there was a little more power. Great portability and functionality.</li>
    <li> I used this tooth brush for a few weeks to try it out.  It&#x27;s a compact, battery operated tooth brush,ideally used for travel purposes. It&#x27;s a good size for a woman&#x27;s purse (not much bigger than a tube of mascara) or keeping in your desk at work. However, cost-wise, this would be one expensive spare tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t twist!  My first instinct was to twist the top lid off, but that just opens the case to the battery compartment.  Pull straight off to get to the tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life... I noticed a bit of a drop in battery power with just a few uses.  It didn&#x27;t go dead, but I knew it wasn&#x27;t working as hard as it could be, but it still hummed along and cleaned my teeth just fine.  The description says 90 days based on two brushes per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s compact design will appeal to some, but at this price point, it&#x27;s a bit hard to pull the trigger for a device that&#x27;s travel sized.  I could really only justify the price if it were an every day tooth brush one would use as a matter of course at home both in the morning and at night.</li>
    <li> I use a Sonicare toothbrush and have grown quite attached to it. So when this Panasonic option became available, I was excited as it can be cumbersome to pack up the Sonicare while traveling (although I do it as my teeth just don&#x27;t feel as clean without it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed when I received this toothbrush. While it is smaller, it is just a glorified toothbrush with a very expensive price tag. The replacement brushes are expensive and the results are not much better than a $1.00 toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your cash. Pack up your Sonicare - it will save you the frustration and some cash. If you can&#x27;t travel with your electric toothbrush, then I recommend buying a cheapie and use the rest of your saved money for a dinner. It will be much more satisfying.</li>
    <li> I always thought the idea of an electric toothbrush was sort of silly.  I would never have bought one, but when it was offered by Amazon Vine I decided to try it.  I was really reluctant to use it after it came.  It took me a couple of months before I tried it.  The first time I used it, I was not impressed and was tempted to write a review saying as much.  However, I feel honor bound to review all the Amazon Vine products I try fairly, so I determined to continue using it.  I must admit that there is a learning curve involved.  I experimented with different ways of using this vibrating toothbrush.  I found that one doesn&#x27;t really do much brushing, but a lot of changing positions and angles of approach.  I&#x27;m now a convert.  I&#x27;d heartily recommend this product to anyone.  I love the way my teeth feel after brushing with it.  I much prefer it to a manual toothbrush.  To my great surprise, five stars.</li>
    <li> Nice travel tooth brush, a little smaller than I thought but good enough for travel</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice size to throw in the utility kit since use electric @ home and easier to pack than the one I use @ home.</li>
    <li> This is much easier to carry while traveling rather than my rechargeable. Works the same and nice to have the cover.</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> Pretty useless. the vibrations don&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Panasonic electric toothbrush for about a month, and have been thrilled with it... simply put, it does a wonderful job of cleaning my teeth. My family has used several basic Sonicare toothbrushes in the past - Sonicare Essence and Sonicare for Kids - and overall I think the sonic-vibration cleaning action of the Panasonic brush is fairly similar and just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite things about this toothbrush is the lipstick-like top, which keeps the brush clean whether traveling or at home, and I also love that it runs for a very long time on a single AAA battery. The replacement heads are definitely pricey, but no more expensive than those for other similar-quality electric toothbrushes and well worth the cost in the long run. The biggest negative for us is that, unlike the Sonicare brushes, Panasonic&#x27;s brush has no auto-shutoff feature. I tend to zone out when brushing my teeth, and without a timer, often find myself brushing my teeth for 4 or 5 minutes before I come back to earth. My daughter, on the other hand, simply doesn&#x27;t brush long enough before she decides that it&#x27;s time to quit. So, not entirely perfect, but overall a very affordable, quality electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Crest spinbrush as my regular toothbrush for sometime, and often travel. This left me always desiring my spinbrush when I traveled. Due to its size, I didn&#x27;t want to bring the spinbrush, so I was looking for an alternative. I ended up seeing this, and picked it up. After receiving it, I have to admit, I was surprised how small it is. In some ways that&#x27;s good, as its great for traveling, but it feels very different compared to the spinbrush. It almost reminds me of a lip stick container when the lid is on. Nothing necessarily wrong with that, but that will probably give you an idea of how it appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m not a dentist, I can&#x27;t say how much better this toothbrush is in terms of cleaning compared to another, but my experiences have been positive. My teeth do feel clean afterwards, and that is what I expect from a toothbrush. The vibrations don&#x27;t seem as strong as the Crest Spinbrush, but do seem to do the job. I&#x27;ve gotten so used to having that vibration when brushing, that it&#x27;s helped very much for when I&#x27;m out of town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a traveling standpoint, it&#x27;s great. Smaller than the regular toothbrush I brought, and helped fill a void for me while traveling. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d use it as my regular toothbrush all the time, but it certainly would do the job. My only hesitation for not using it all the time would be the size. It is a big small, and for my bigger hands, isn&#x27;t as easy to grip compared to a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good purchase, and one I certainly do not regret, as it works great for my intended uses.</li>
    <li> We have been using Panasonic Toothbrushes for some time. We additionally bought two of these for our kids. They now enjoy brushing tooth and keep them clean. Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> It is compact and quieter than my sonicare but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing a good job. And my dog is still totally afraid of it.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR SENSATIVE TEETH</li>
    <li> I travel a lot on business and had high hopes for this travel toothbrush as I like other Panasonic products.  The head is too compact for my liking and it seems this product was more geared for people with smaller mouths.  Also I just don&#x27;t feel like it did as good a job cleaning teeth as the disposable electric Oral-B toothbrushes I have been using while traveling.</li>
    <li> Nice toothbrush to carry around with you with travel size toothpaste for brushing on the go. It resembles mascara or lipstick but doesn&#x27;t look too feminine so is suitable for men. Powerful vibration considering it&#x27;s size. Appears to be water resistant.</li>
    <li> Notice how most of the 4 and 5 star reviews are from people who got their&#x27;s FREE .... Vine program, in other words;  and who likely want to continue getting free products by ingratiating themselves with these favorable reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, Amazon customers: any reviews from Vine participants should be viewed with suspicion and their objectivity taken into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review for this product is based on having bought one here at Amazon, used it for some time, and sharing my unbiased results.  Vine reviews are akin to having company representatives on here, reviewing their own products. How can that be objective?  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re all nice, well-meaning folks.  But consider the source, is all I&#x27;m saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush worked about as well as a manual brush for me; far short of my full-sized battery toothbrush I sometimes use in the home.  It&#x27;s replacement heads are very expensive as well.&lt;br /&gt;It looks very nice and maybe encourages users to take it along when otherwise they might not take a manual one, but that&#x27;s about all of the upside I can see.</li>
