      <li>smells great not stiff</li>

      <li>Light &amp;#34;stay in place&amp;#34; hold without being sticky and scent is heavenly.</li>
      <li>Great hold especially in humid weather.</li>
      <li>Great for then hair if you want to hold the hair into place and still get that soft natural look.</li>
      <li>I have to hold my breath while spraying and then quickly walk out of the cloud.</li>
      <li>I love this spray it is light, but holds and provides volume yet your hair is soft and moves.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is my new favorite between the hold and the smell.</li>
      <li>My new favorite finishing step.</li>
      <li>but I am willing to splurge on this often!</li>
      <li>Such an amazing product, provides a touchable hold (not &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; at all).</li>
      <li>Love that it holds and yet keeps my hair soft to the touch</li>
      <li>Not too sticky, and holds just right.</li>
      <li>and it holds super well.&amp;#34; On my wedding day she used the Strong Hold, which is for big events like weddings, proms, photo shoots, etc.</li>
      <li>This hairspray is great for adding body without making your hair feel hard, sticky, etc.  </li>
      <li>My wife loves this stuff, and it is a better price than locally</li>
      <li>and I have run hot water over the nozzle and done everything i know to do and it will not spray.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use hairspray often, but when I do, I love that I can use one that is in the same line as the oil.</li>
      <li>This works very well for me and the nozzle does not clog up!</li>
      <li>I have very fine long hair</li>
      <li>Like with any product, too much can leave your hair feeling oily so only spray a light mist!</li>
      <li>I love this product - having been using it for a long time, however, the two bottles I ordered from this source do not spray well.</li>
      <li>so I will continue using but will order strong hold next time.  </li>
      <li>Product is really good, but the sprayer is hard to spray and too much spray comes out at once.</li>
      <li>It really does not provide much hold or support.  </li>
      <li>Very sticky on my hair.</li>
      <li>Light enough to use as a sculpting products.</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>Holds hair but very flexible.</li>
      <li>I recommend everyone to try it, not expensive &amp; really soft on the hair !</li>
      <li>Hold is good, can run my fingers through it, not too stiff and the smell is something I actually look forward too on styling days!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this hairspray!, Thank you</li>
    <li> Works really well. A little goes a long way. Smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t linger. Hold lasts most of the day, even in light wind.</li>
    <li> I love this as well as their hair spray... a little goes a long way with both</li>
    <li> My first experience with Moroccanoil hairspray was on my wedding day; my hair dresser insisted upon &amp;#34;it because it smells so good and it holds super well.&amp;#34; On my wedding day she used the Strong Hold, which is for big events like weddings, proms, photo shoots, etc. where you need 24/7 hold. Therefore, when ordering for myself, I chose the Medium Hold, as I only need it to last 10 hrs tops while at work or out to visit friends/family. Let me tell you, I can spray this stuff all over my head and it doesn&#x27;t even look like I have hairspray in. The Medium Hold holds perfect for what I needed, and I don&#x27;t find that I need to reapply during the day. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments lately about &amp;#34;what am I doing recently with my hair because it just looks flat out awesome!&amp;#34; Who doesn&#x27;t like compliments! This stuff is my new favorite between the hold and the smell. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll ever use anything other than this again!</li>
    <li> Second time to buy.  Great smell, and flake free hold in humid weather.  Also good for comb thru!</li>
    <li> I love this spray it is light, but holds and provides volume yet your hair is soft and moves.  This is the only spray I use.</li>
    <li> One of the best I have ever tried!!!  Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried many.  Holds hair but very flexible. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This hairspray is the best I have ever used.  Not only does it hold; it smells absolutely wonderful!!  Also, not sticky!!  Luv it!</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product, provides a touchable hold (not &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; at all). The smell is in credible, I always get compliments on my hair when I use this product. LOVE LOVE LOVE, will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the smell of this hairspray! It also makes your hair shiny and has okay hold. Like with any product, too much can leave your hair feeling oily so only spray a light mist!</li>
    <li> This Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray (Medium Hold) is excellent. Does not leave hair dull or sticky. Lasts all day. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The medium spray is good for styling, has a nice fragrance.  Recommended by hair stylists in elite salons.  Less expensive than many retail stores.</li>
    <li> Together with the Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment works wonders, leaves hair shining and silky smooth, keeps hair in place without sticky residue.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> was defective&lt;br /&gt;refund promptly</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have tried in all my years of using products.  I use the oil, shampoo, conditioner and smoothing cream.  Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> Can dented, wrap on can had bubbles.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff, and it is a better price than locally</li>
    <li> This is a knock-off product!!! The front of the bottle is not the same. The back has instructions in another language (possibly Arabic?) and the cap is different. In addition, the product does not feel the same in my hair. Worst of all, when I use this, my face breaks out in a rash and itches like crazy. So disappointed!! What a waste of money. Can&#x27;t even use it. Buying my hairspray from the salon from now on</li>
    <li> This works very well for me and the nozzle does not clog up!</li>
    <li> I always use this and love it. Not too sticky, and holds just right.</li>
    <li> great product.  Light enough to use as a sculpting products.</li>
    <li> I will definitely purchase this product again in about a week.  I love the medium hold fragrance but not the firm hold smell.</li>
    <li> I contact the owner bc my swirly top isn&#x27;t working on the bottle and no response</li>
    <li> Yet wanted something to lightly set my, &amp;#34;beachy waves&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s a tad crunchy for me. I love the smell and will continue to use in the more humid months as the hold is a bit more than I wanted. I probably should have gone for a, &amp;#34;working spay&amp;#34;. I think it would be great for somebody wanting a true medium hold and again, lovely smelling!</li>
    <li> Great hold especially in humid weather. Love the scent...</li>
    <li> Love this product! Not too heavy and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray.  Its not a heavy sticky spray and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and no complaints.</li>
    <li> Great for then hair if you want to hold the hair into place and still get that soft natural look.</li>
    <li> Product came as described</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  I have very fine long hair and it tends to be flyaway.  This gives just enough control to hold the flyaways in place, but still leaves my hair feeling like hair.  It also smells wonderful and leaves my hair very soft and shiny!  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairspray.  Light, soft hold, and a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  It does not leave your hair sticky and hard.</li>
    <li> Great price great product, introduced at my salon, but like your prices much better!</li>
    <li> I like this hairspray but I wish I would have ordered the strong hold versus medium.  It really does not provide much hold or support.  I do like how shiny it makes my hair so I will continue using but will order strong hold next time.  The smell is a little overwhelming - I have to hold my breath while spraying and then quickly walk out of the cloud.</li>
    <li> this is the best hairspray out there! pricing is very good on amazon!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest hairspray, it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
    <li> It is really great for styling and makes my hair shine. I would recommend it to all my friends. Ask your stylist to try it on your hair.</li>
    <li> Love that it holds and yet keeps my hair soft to the touch</li>
    <li> Great product and smell wonderful</li>
    <li> This is a great hairspray!  It says medium hold but is closer to a light/medium hold.  I love that I can easily brush through my hair after applying it but it holds great.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Moroccanoil hairspray is very light and give your hair a nice shine. I will recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Product is really good, but the sprayer is hard to spray and too much spray comes out at once. This product is not returnable.</li>
    <li> keep that addictive smell going all day and a gently, soft but firm hold!  Shinier hair too!  My new favorite finishing step.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is great for adding body without making your hair feel hard, sticky, etc.  It smells great and just about anyone can use it!  This product is a favorite with most of my clients!</li>
    <li> smells great not stiff your hair is still workable and shiney</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s amazing I love it I recommend everyone to try it, not expensive &amp; really soft on the hair !</li>
    <li> very light but gives my very thin fine hair a little body and still soft and manageable.  I do not like stiff sprays so I use this to add texture to my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this. It&#x27;s very light and holds your hair in place without making it stiff. It smells amazing too, sometimes I&#x27;ll spray it on just for the smell...</li>
    <li> I love this product - having been using it for a long time, however, the two bottles I ordered from this source do not spray well. After each use I have to remove the small white plastic tip and soak in very hot water before it will spray again. Extremely aggravating. Will continue using the product but wonder if the sprayers malfunction from being packed/shipped  on the side???</li>
    <li> Does not smell good. Leaves a bad scent on my hair. The signature good smell is not there. Very sticky on my hair.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome but I dont necessarily agree that it&#x27;s medium hold,  unless my hair is just that thick.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smells so good.  This was just like what I had previously gotten from the salon.</li>
    <li> I used it one week and it clogged up and I have run hot water over the nozzle and done everything i know to do and it will not spray.  I love moroccanoil hairspray but the last 2 cans I ordered have clogged.  Lot of money for no spray!!</li>
    <li> It will not spray out 😒 I am not sure what to do with it since it will not spray</li>
    <li> I have used Moroccanoil oil for a couple of years. I don&#x27;t use hairspray often, but when I do, I love that I can use one that is in the same line as the oil. It holds well. This is medium which means my hair is touchable and you can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;m wearing hairspray.</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes my hair feel fantastic!!!!</li>
    <li> I had my hair done at the salon and they used Morocanoil products on my hair.  Not only did I feel like my hair was made of silk, it was so shiney and the smell ... Oh the smell ... all the way home I kept swinging my head just to get a whiff!  I just to had this product for my daily routine ~ bought the hairspray, shampoo, creme rinse &amp; styling cream.  Unlike Sebastian, that I&#x27;ve used for 15 or 18 years ~ the hairspray (medium hold) keeps they style, but is not sticky or stiff at all ~ so natural and again, the scent doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t fight with the other products because they all have the same scent.</li>
    <li> Loved this product. Spray  on roots of hair and before I straighten my hair. Holds great. Will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Works well. Hold is good, can run my fingers through it, not too stiff and the smell is something I actually look forward too on styling days! I wish it was a little more affordable but I am willing to splurge on this often! Did I mention the smell??? Love it!</li>
    <li> If the smell doesn&#x27;t captivate you the hold will!  Light &amp;#34;stay in place&amp;#34; hold without being sticky and scent is heavenly.</li>
