### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is great!</li>
      <li>This gel remover works great!  </li>
      <li>Everyone told me that this kind of packets weren&#x27;t very effective but these worked great.  </li>
      <li>works good in removing gel polish.</li>
      <li>if you are doing your own gel nails or polish this works good for removing,</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>NOT IF MORE WOULD HAVE  HELP.  </li>
      <li>SPEND MORE  THAN TWO MINUTES EACH HAND.  </li>
      <li>However, I found that rubbing each nail works better.  </li>
      <li>OK</li>
      <li>Thought it would be a piece of cake, since most of it was off anyway.</li>
      <li>Again, I love this remover</li>
      <li>Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
      <li>to use, I guess it takes a bit of practice, so I didn&#x27;t get the most even coverage.</li>
      <li>I flip it one more time and do my two thumbs.</li>
      <li>What a fabulous idea.</li>
      <li>You can fit 4-5 fingers in at a time and let in soak and soften.</li>
      <li>It is not hard to apply however it only lasts a day or two before it begins to chip - and then you need this awesome remover to remove it.  </li>
      <li>but at this point I still have significant gel polish residue all over my nails.  </li>
      <li>I ended up using full strength acetone to get the color off since these pads didn&#x27;t do the job they said they would.  </li>
      <li>Enough damage to the color to not look so good;</li>
      <li>But it did stay on until I removed it about a week later without chips, so that was nice.</li>
      <li>I have to leave my fingers in the packet for 10 - 15 minutes, but then the polish peels right off.</li>
      <li>The directions say to hold the gel pad against the nail for two minutes and the polish comes right off.  </li>
      <li>Invest in a good bottle of professional strength polish remover and cotton pads, it&#x27;ll be cheaper in the long run.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty gentle, only taking off the top layer of polish the first time.</li>
      <li>like most men, my husband complains loudly about the smell of nail polish and remover, but he says that these smell better than any other nail product I&#x27;ve used!</li>
      <li>Tried this for the first time last night on Gelish polish which had already peeled halfway off on its own, plus I filed the surfaces thoroughly prior to trying remover.</li>
      <li>OMG--listen to all the criticisms listed here by others--dries out very quickly, doesn&#x27;t really make contact with your entire nail, soaked for 30 minutes and almost nothing happened.</li>
      <li>removing of gel so much easier and</li>
      <li>Plus, you cannot do anything else while you are sitting there, except for maybe look for a better alternative to this product on the computer with your other hand.</li>
      <li>The only thing true about this product is that there was &amp;#34;No-Mess.&amp;#34; I checked my nails after 5 minutes and nothing had happened.</li>
      <li>So although it did remove the gel polish pretty quickly, it was kind of uncomfortable, and costly since I had to use two pads.  </li>
      <li>especially when many nail salons are closed on Sunday that I couldnt seek an appointment to have them fixed.</li>
      <li>I ended up tearing up my natural nails pretty thoroughly trying to get the polish off because the remover did next to nothing.</li>
      <li>The Express Gel Remover works great, seemed a little weird at first sticking my hand in the package but it removed the product fast.</li>
      <li>The remover-soaked pad is large and sturdy and is enough to remove polish from all 10 nails.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now completed two cycles of this soaking/scrubbing process (on one hand, opening a brand new packet for the second cycle)</li>
      <li>Also, it dried out quickly</li>
      <li>Of all available options, these pads seem to be the fastest method, and have the advantage of creating the least exposure to acetone.</li>
      <li>I sat with my hand in the bag for over 10 minutes and it barely even softened the polish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll work on the getting the technique down and then see if it&#x27;s worth the extra effort.</li>
      <li>helps to not dry my hands out.</li>
      <li>Normally, I do my four fingers, then I flip the padding inside out and do the other 4 fingers.</li>

<li> I left it on for 10 minutes and all it did was dry out and irritate my finger tips.  </li>
<li> has long as your gel manicure does before you have to use.</li>
<li> Only negative is you only get five of them and you can&#x27;t save the packets for reuse.  </li>
<li> Total waste of time and money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d say that 95% of the polish was removed due to scraping with a metal scrape and filing.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m off to look at reviews on Amazon on other gel polish remover systems.</li>
<li> tried everything one fingernail at a time ,etc COMPLETE RIP-OFF</li>
<li> Packet says it takes less than two minutes.  </li>
<li> This product does not remove gel nail polish in less than 2 minutes....</li>
<li> It did ever so slightly remove at the the side of the nail.  </li>
<li> Pressing my fingernails firmly against the acetone-dampened yellow cotton pad for 2-3 minutes is slightly uncomfortable and means I can only do one hand at a time.  </li>
<li> This does not cleanly remove a salon shellac-type UV polish.  </li>
<li> It is a little tricky and messy.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m alternating between 2-3 minutes of pressing firmly with 1-2 minutes of using the pad to scrub the polish off.  </li>
<li> Waste of money and time.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, my nails were a home job (no heat) and the gel began to crack and barely lasted a week.  </li>
<li> WAS  VERY LITTLE REMOVER  </li>
<li> I usually lay a hand towel across my lap to catch the scrapings and use my thigh or a pillow to press the pad against.</li>
<li> remover liquid doesn&#x27;t lift gel polishes, even if you file them to dull the surface.  </li>
<li> The Nutra nail gel polish is really hard to get off.</li>
<li> This product is not effective.  </li>
<li> The remover product merely produced a very slight crackling to the surface of the polish.</li>
<li> - these are really hard to use!!!</li>
<li> This removed my OPI gel manicure, but it was awkward holding my hand in the foil pack.  </li>
<li> Wrong!  </li>
<li> It is impossible to have all your nails against the cloth pad inside the packet (your thumb opposes your fingers).  </li>
<li> But nothing happens because this is a stupid idea.</li>
<li> This produce was worthless.  </li>
<li> VERY DISAPPOINTED  DON&#x27;T BUY</li>
<li> Having said that, the gel polish that this remover removes is HORRIBLE!  </li>
<li> This was terrible</li>
<li> but I HATE the gel polish that it removes!!</li>

    <li> to use, I guess it takes a bit of practice, so I didn&#x27;t get the most even coverage. But it did stay on until I removed it about a week later without chips, so that was nice. I&#x27;ll work on the getting the technique down and then see if it&#x27;s worth the extra effort.</li>
    <li> This product does not remove gel nail polish in less than 2 minutes....in fact, it didn&#x27;t work at all.  After 30 minutes of soaking one hand in the pack, nothing happened, I ended up having to add regular nail polish remover and had to scrape the polish off my nails.  Probably works well and would be convenient for regular nail polish but ineffective on the gel nail polish products.</li>
    <li> This is a joke. They took a paper towel dipped it in a tiny bit of acetone then out it in a bag. You are supposed to rip open bag, put your nail tips in it and squeeze. But nothing happens because this is a stupid idea. Go get a $2 bottle of Acetone from local drug store. It will last you a lifetime. Dip paper towel pieces in it and out in nails.  The. The joke is in them.</li>
    <li> This does not cleanly remove a salon shellac-type UV polish.  I will stick with the cotton ball &amp; aluminum foil approach. I&#x27;ve been sitting with my fingers in the packet for 10 minutes. Pressing my fingernails firmly against the acetone-dampened yellow cotton pad for 2-3 minutes is slightly uncomfortable and means I can only do one hand at a time.  I&#x27;m alternating between 2-3 minutes of pressing firmly with 1-2 minutes of using the pad to scrub the polish off.  I&#x27;ve now completed two cycles of this soaking/scrubbing process (on one hand, opening a brand new packet for the second cycle) but at this point I still have significant gel polish residue all over my nails.  Waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> The Express Gel Remover works great, seemed a little weird at first sticking my hand in the package but it removed the product fast.</li>
    <li> Bought a package of these to go along with the 5 minute gel nail color set as recommended.  This produce was worthless.  After 30 minutes of \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; my nails with the pads, I still had gel color on all 10 of my nails and there was only one coat of polish on my nails to start with.  I ended up using full strength acetone to get the color off since these pads didn&#x27;t do the job they said they would.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.  Invest in a good bottle of professional strength polish remover and cotton pads, it&#x27;ll be cheaper in the long run.</li>
    <li> This gel remover works great!  The remover-soaked pad is large and sturdy and is enough to remove polish from all 10 nails.  Having said that, the gel polish that this remover removes is HORRIBLE!  It is not hard to apply however it only lasts a day or two before it begins to chip - and then you need this awesome remover to remove it.  Again, I love this remover but I HATE the gel polish that it removes!!</li>
    <li> Product does remove gel nail polish.  Each foil packet comes with pads soak in nail remover.  You can fit 4-5 fingers in at a time and let in soak and soften. However, I found that rubbing each nail works better.  Only negative is you only get five of them and you can&#x27;t save the packets for reuse.  I guess if your nails really do last a week or 10 days, this product will last you for some time.  Unfortunately, my nails were a home job (no heat) and the gel began to crack and barely lasted a week.  I bought another home kit that applies heat and we&#x27;ll see how long this product will last.  Of course, it&#x27;ll last only has long as your gel manicure does before you have to use.</li>
    <li> works good in removing gel polish. if you are doing your own gel nails or polish this works good for removing,</li>
    <li> Save your money. Used two packets instead of one as stated in directions. Packet says it takes less than two minutes.  Tried for almost an hour. No results.</li>
    <li> Everyone told me that this kind of packets weren&#x27;t very effective but these worked great.  I had no problem removing all my gel polish within a couple of minutes.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> The Nutra nail gel polish is really hard to get off. I found it took awhile with this polish remover and one pkg. wouldn&#x27;t do all ten fingers.</li>
    <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes removing of gel so much easier and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also helps to not dry my hands out.</li>
    <li> I have used these packets for my salon gel nails (shellac/IBD). I have to leave my fingers in the packet for 10 - 15 minutes, but then the polish peels right off. Normally, I do my four fingers, then I flip the padding inside out and do the other 4 fingers. I flip it one more time and do my two thumbs. Works every time.</li>
    <li> I would give this zero stars if I could. Tried this for the first time last night on Gelish polish which had already peeled halfway off on its own, plus I filed the surfaces thoroughly prior to trying remover. Thought it would be a piece of cake, since most of it was off anyway. OMG--listen to all the criticisms listed here by others--dries out very quickly, doesn&#x27;t really make contact with your entire nail, soaked for 30 minutes and almost nothing happened. I&#x27;d say that 95% of the polish was removed due to scraping with a metal scrape and filing. The remover product merely produced a very slight crackling to the surface of the polish. I ended up tearing up my natural nails pretty thoroughly trying to get the polish off because the remover did next to nothing. Total waste of time and money. I&#x27;m off to look at reviews on Amazon on other gel polish remover systems.</li>
    <li> The only thing true about this product is that there was &amp;#34;No-Mess.&amp;#34; I checked my nails after 5 minutes and nothing had happened. I kept my nails pressed and even rubbed them against the pad and after 30 minutes I still had to scrape the polish off.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work to remove gel polish.  The directions say to hold the gel pad against the nail for two minutes and the polish comes right off.  Wrong!  I left it on for 10 minutes and all it did was dry out and irritate my finger tips.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I RUBBED  AND MASSAGED MY  NAILS INSIDE THE POUCH  FOR 12 AND 13  MINUTES EACH HAND.  THE POLISH DID NOT COME OFF. I READ THE REVIEWS AFTER  PURCHASING..  (REGRETTABLELY  I  DIDN&#x27;T DO IT BEFOREHAND)  SO I PREPARED  TO  SPEND MORE  THAN TWO MINUTES EACH HAND.  THERE  WAS  VERY LITTLE REMOVER  IN THE PACKAGE.  I DO NOT IF MORE WOULD HAVE  HELP.  VERY DISAPPOINTED  DON&#x27;T BUY</li>
    <li> This was terrible it did NOT remove the uv type polish after several minutes of soaking and rubbing the nails.</li>
    <li> no-mess because it does not work!  30 minutes of pressing pad against nails and no results!  tried everything one fingernail at a time ,etc COMPLETE RIP-OFF</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work to remove my salon gel color as the box indictes it would.  It did ever so slightly remove at the the side of the nail.  Enough damage to the color to not look so good; especially when many nail salons are closed on Sunday that I couldnt seek an appointment to have them fixed.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I sat with my hand in the bag for over 10 minutes and it barely even softened the polish. Plus, you cannot do anything else while you are sitting there, except for maybe look for a better alternative to this product on the computer with your other hand. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> This removed my OPI gel manicure, but it was awkward holding my hand in the foil pack.  Also, it dried out quickly so I had to use two pads.  So although it did remove the gel polish pretty quickly, it was kind of uncomfortable, and costly since I had to use two pads.  OK product&lt;br /&gt;Revision - these are really hard to use!!! Not recommended.</li>
    <li> This is great! What a fabulous idea. It travels well and does the job when needed. No leaking bottles in suitcases.</li>
    <li> This product is not effective.  It is impossible to have all your nails against the cloth pad inside the packet (your thumb opposes your fingers).  Even if you can contort your hand so that your nails are contacting the pad, the (diluted ... water is the second ingredient) remover liquid doesn&#x27;t lift gel polishes, even if you file them to dull the surface.  Save your money and use the foil and cotton balls with acetone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these pads to remove Gelish or Shellac polish that I&#x27;ve had applied at a Salon, or done at myself home. I have also soaked off the polish in a bowl of acetone or used the cotton balls wrapped onto my nails. Of all available options, these pads seem to be the fastest method, and have the advantage of creating the least exposure to acetone. The trick is to rub your nails against the pad for a minute or two and then use a metal tool to begin to scrape the polish off. I&#x27;m pretty gentle, only taking off the top layer of polish the first time. While I&#x27;m scraping one nail I keep the rest of that hand in the pouch pressed against the pad. It is a little tricky and messy. I usually lay a hand towel across my lap to catch the scrapings and use my thigh or a pillow to press the pad against. like most men, my husband complains loudly about the smell of nail polish and remover, but he says that these smell better than any other nail product I&#x27;ve used!</li>
