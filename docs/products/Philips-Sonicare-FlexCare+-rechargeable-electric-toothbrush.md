      <li>The one thing I am impressed about the most on this model is the options for the kind of teeth you have.</li>
      <li>I have used a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush for over 5 years and received good service from it.</li>
      <li>Plus, while one still needs to floss, this toothbrush does indeed dislodge a good amount of food debris from between the teeth.</li>
      <li>My teeth don&#x27;t feel quite as in need of a good brushing at night as they used to.</li>
      <li>and I feel like my gums are getting a (good) workout as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a number of these over the years and this model seems as good as any of them.  </li>
      <li>B00QZ67NQC Philips Sonicare HX6631/30 3 Series Gum Health Rechargeable]], which I did not like, thus proving to me that not all Sonicare models are good (which I had thought).</li>
      <li>It has a great grip; the handle feels really nice in the hand.</li>
      <li>This can&#x27;t be good for the environment.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like she sells the toothbrushes, and she&#x27;s the best dentist I&#x27;ve ever had, so I was willing to take her advice.</li>
      <li>Sonicare, I also love that my teeth feel like I just went to the dental hygienist!</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this Sonicare toothbrush!</li>
      <li>I asked my dentist and his hygenist if the massage mode was safe to use and got a resounding &#x27;yes!&#x27;  </li>
      <li>, bottom line is that I am truly impressed with the performance of Sonicare after using it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really liked that.  </li>
      <li>The Oral B is excellent too, but I&#x27;m much happier with the performance and design of the Sonicare.</li>
      <li>Of Nice Features</li>
      <li>Adding the gum massage at the end of brushing is a nice touch as my dentist has recommended that.</li>
      <li>This is a nice brush.  </li>
      <li>Flexcare Plus it absolutely the best sonic toothbrush we&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That was well over two years ago, having started with my wife&#x27;s brush, then moved on to my own, [</li>
      <li>I own many Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>Sure the travel cases are nice, but you can figure something else out.</li>
      <li>Honestly, my gums look better after just two days.</li>
      <li>the 05 travel case is REALLY nice - attractive, modern and USB chargeable.</li>
      <li>and I feel like it both polishes and removes more plaque.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Based on my experience with Sonicare brushes for many years, I would recommend this brush to anyone looking to improve their dental checkups.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for many years now and swear by the brand.</li>
      <li>My dentist commented that some of his more zealous patients tend to overbrush</li>
      <li>so I want to maintain what I&#x27;ve had done and have healthy gums.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t stay on top of it, you may not even realize it&#x27;s going</li>
      <li>but the dentist said to stick with it and it would get better.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
      <li>Some years ago when my wife had oral surgery, her periodontist recommended a change to an electric toothbrush, and the top of the line Philips Sonicare at that time became her weapon of choice.</li>
      <li>It seems more stable too.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Though I prefer the Oral-B, I think most people would rather have the Philips just because it is a lot quieter.  </li>
      <li>My dentist noticed initial signs of gingivitis, and the Sonicare is superb at gum care.</li>
      <li>I hope the dentist is pleased in 6 months.</li>
      <li>so I recommend you speak with your dental hygienist or dentist about what would be the best model for the current condition of your mouth.  </li>
      <li>I have  to say I feel more benefit and comfort from the Sonicare than the Oral B.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have several brands of electric toothbrushes, plus an assortment of travel battery-powered ones as well. The Sonicares are among my favorites and here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The biggest plus is that I feel it cleans my teeth really well. It&#x27;s very fast and I feel like it both polishes and removes more plaque. It  feels like it&#x27;s one of the strongest of the electric ones I&#x27;ve owned and I feel like my gums are getting a (good) workout as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Strong as the vibration is, I did not find it difficult or uncomfortable to hold the base as I am cleaning my teeth. Normally I am a little sensitive to that but I did not have that problem here. I have noticed that a few people have complained so this might be an issue for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It&#x27;s nice looking which normally is kind of a silly thing to note for a toothbrush but this does stay on a bathroom counter and it looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It comes with a plastic traveling case that does have some holes for venting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.) There are 5 cleaning \\&quot;modes\\&quot;. Most electric toothbrushes have several options similar to this. Personally the first option - the \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; mode - was my favorite and the cycle lasts 2 minutes. You can also use a \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; mode or one for whitening, polishing, and gum care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish this had was some sort of sterilizing unit. I have read several pros and cons to them, many suggesting they really don&#x27;t work that well, but I&#x27;ve always liked them. In lieu of that,  recommend submerging the brush into a peroxide so some sort of antibacterial rinse every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. Note that I also have the Sonicare Diamond Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush which is like this but also has a charging cup and a pretty traveling case that has a USB charging port, but it&#x27;s a little more money and the toothbrush itself functions pretty much the same. You decide if you want those extras.</li>
    <li> I own another Sonicare electric toothbrush, and found this one to be more gentle when it came to brushing my teeth. I like that the travel case has holes to allow the brush tip to dry and breath, a built in charger would have been a welcome addition to the travel case but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Philips Sonicare!  This HX6921/04 Flexcare+ model is fully loaded with everything you need for complete gum care.  You pay extra for these features over their more basic models so I recommend you speak with your dental hygienist or dentist about what would be the best model for the current condition of your mouth.  The box I received also has a $70 bonus of a $50 toward a philips zoom professional whitening treatment which is nice if you want to do that; I did not, so I will not be reviewing that only the toothbrush.  Phillips Sonicare is the #1 recommended brand by dental professionals and I have to agree that once I tried it, I would never go without it again.  Having a clean mouth is just so important to your health and sense of well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the different modes as described on this Amazon webpage and they all seemed to be functioning as described and promised.  I feel like what i receive is exactly what I was expecting after viewing the Amazon webpage which is good.  I have been using Philips Sonicare for decades and have never had a model die on me or need servicing.  I highly recommend Philips Sonicare including this model the Flexcare+ if this is the model your dental professionals say is the best choice for your mouth.</li>
    <li> Wrong item..please sell what is being advertised..</li>
    <li> Wonderful Philips Sonicare toothbrush! I owned a previous model of the Flexcare for five plus years. The on/off button stopped working, and so I opted to purchase the [[ASIN:B004M1BO3U Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] which has only one speed. I wanted to save money and I had never used any of the other speeds on my Flexcare, so that model served me well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had to opportunity to try the [[ASIN:B00QZ67NQC Philips Sonicare HX6631/30 3 Series Gum Health Rechargeable]], which I did not like, thus proving to me that not all Sonicare models are good (which I had thought). That model is loud, the handle is bigger and slippery (not having the grippy back surface), and it vibrates hard in the hand. Not a pleasant brushing experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is great. I didn&#x27;t mind having a one speed model and gave the Easy Clean five stars, too. But, the addition of a one minute mode, either for extra cleaning or a touch-up, is a great one. This model is nice and quiet, too, and doesn&#x27;t vibrate much in the hand. It has a great grip; the handle feels really nice in the hand. It is simply a great tooth brushing experience all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this tea drinker, using a Sonicare is mandatory. Plus, while one still needs to floss, this toothbrush does indeed dislodge a good amount of food debris from between the teeth. I truly hate flossing as my teeth are tight, and while I still do it, these ultrasonic toothbrushes cut down on flossing time (hurrah)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend using a Sonicare toothbrush highly enough. My dentist feels the same way. When I first started using one, I was shocked at how clean my teeth felt, and delighted that I could keep those tea stains under control without brushing too hard with a regular toothbrush. Now, I can&#x27;t live without using a Sonicare. The other brands don&#x27;t compare. This is a great model with excellent features. One can also use other heads on it, including the Diamond Clean head, without spending the bigger bucks for that model. Now that I&#x27;ve tried some other models, two good, one not-so-good, I can say that one is great - it&#x27;s just right.Clean head, without spending the bigger bucks for that model. Now that I&#x27;ve tried some other models, two good, one not-so-good, I can say that one is great - it&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> I love this Sonicare toothbrush! It comes with a nice travel case and a charger and no other gadgets -just nice and straightforward. I&#x27;ve been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for many years, most recently one in the Oral B 5000 Pro series. The Oral B is excellent too, but I&#x27;m much happier with the performance and design of the Sonicare. I do recommend that as soon as you get the Sonicare, register online to extend the warranty from 2 to 2-1/2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extended warranty is important to me based on past experience. I bought the older version of this model back in 2010 for my husband (HX6932/10), and he loved it but the battery died within a year and he got a replacement that also died 6 months later. When two died in a row, he gave up and switched to Oral B. I haven&#x27;t owned this newer Sonicare model long enough to know whether battery/charging issues are a problem, though so far so good! This Sonicare showed up fully charged out of the box and is still on green about a week later. One full charge is supposed to last a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing Sonicare and Oral B 5000, they are both great. But I do favor Sonicare because the 5 different modes are so clearly displayed on the handle- it&#x27;s just so easy to see and select the desired mode.  The Oral B 5000 has 5 settings, but they are not displayed on the handle and instead the one I have has a separate Smartguide gizmo that has never really worked right, and I&#x27;ve just used the default setting on the Oral B. With Sonicare, I am definitely taking advantage of the five different modes as they are so clearly displayed and easy to use. I have gum line recession and very sensitive gums/teeth, so I absolutely love using the sensitive setting (2 minutes, plus I add a little time for the surfaces and a minute of massage), and also like the 3-minute gum massage setting that cleans for 2 minutes and massages for a minute.  A normal cleaning is 2 minutes, plus I add a little extra time to get the surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Sonicare, I also love that my teeth feel like I just went to the dental hygienist! They feel so clean and smooth. My teeth feel clean after the Oral-B, but not to the same extent. Also, brushing with Sonicare doesn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive gum areas, while Oral B is not as gentle- it has a stronger vibration- and I tend to avoid or gloss over the painful areas. In fairness to Oral B, maybe it&#x27;s because I can&#x27;t figure out how to change modes. But changing modes shouldn&#x27;t be so difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Sonicare, I love the longer, slimmer stem and narrower toothbrush head as it reaches back farther to behind my back molars without gagging me. I never really realized that the stem on the Oral-B brushing head is actually too short for me to reach back as far or that the round shape of the brush makes it harder to get way back behind my molars without gagging (sorry if it&#x27;s TMI). The Oral B brush seemed small enough, but I was wrong now that I can compare the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Sonicare, the brush is so narrow and comfortable that I spend equal time in all areas, including the upper molars and sensitive areas. Notably, since using Oral B, I&#x27;ve been getting poor results during dental checkups as to gum recession up around my back molars (getting pockets that are fours) and now I realize it&#x27;s likely because I can&#x27;t comfortably get back far enough to do a good job. After I go for my next check up, I&#x27;ll be sure and update this review to see if those numbers have improved with Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Sonicare and Oral-B recommend the same quadrant brushing approach and a 2-minute cycle minimum. Both momentarily change pace at 30 second intervals so you know to switch quadrants and both automatically shut off. I try to follow the quadrant approach and then go back over the surfaces after. Sonicare uses sonic technology and vibrates but it doesn&#x27;t spin, but my version of Oral B vibrates and oscillates. For me, less is more because Oral B is kind of jarringto my teeth, whereas Sonicare feels gentler yet my teeth feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the design and performance of Sonicare as compared to Oral B (which I still think is very good) and recommend Sonicare. In light of my past experience with charging/battery issues, I definitely recommend registering online to get the extra 6 months on the warranty for a total of 2-1/2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/2015 Update: This Sonicare Flexcare+ toothbrush has truly exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;ve had no charging issues at all. Despite daily use, I only need to charge it every 4-5 weeks! My gum line recession has improved considerably at checkups and my gums feel much less sensitive than before using this toothbrush. I have  to say I feel more benefit and comfort from the Sonicare than the Oral B. This Sonicare toothbrush is awesome- don&#x27;t even hesitate to make this purchase If you&#x27;re looking for a sonic electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/16/2016 Update: This is still my favorite sonic toothbrush ever, and it continues to work perfectly.

    <li> Absolutely love this. meant all my expectations. I have owned one before and knew exactly what I wanted again</li>
    <li> I have an older Philips and I didn&#x27;t realize how un-powerful the old one was until I made the switch to this new one. Honestly, my gums look better after just two days. This is the &amp;#34;deluxe&amp;#34; model, with several different settings and a base for the cord, and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;*Multiple settings, including gum care.&lt;br /&gt;*Extremely powerful vibrations. My teeth look I got them polished at the dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;*Great-sized brush head for small mouths, which also helps with gum care.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;*Base allows you to hide the cord.&lt;br /&gt;*Stays charged for up to 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;*Once the battery goes, you can&#x27;t replace it. You need a whole new unit. This can&#x27;t be good for the environment. Also, I suspect this is why my older one wasn&#x27;t doing the job anymore. If you don&#x27;t stay on top of it, you may not even realize it&#x27;s going downhill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I still highly recommend, although I would love it if we could just replace the battery (as I do with my rechargeable phone).</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush!  It doesn&#x27;t matter what I eat, all day my teeth feel clean!</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Love that it cleans much better than my old Oral-B which was at least ten years old.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this Sonicare, I thought it was going to shake my brain loose!  After years of manual brushing and then eventually a really week vibrating brush, I wasn&#x27;t quite prepared for how powerful this Sonicare would be.  The first time was overwhelming enough that I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would want to continue to use it.  Two weeks later, and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else!  My teeth feel so clean after I brush with this, my gums are noticeably more resilient, and when I spit I see debris and such that I know I wasn&#x27;t getting with other brushes.  Be sure to cut back a little bit on the tooth paste, though!  I used my regular amount and it made me look like I had rabies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build is very good quality, and it feels balanced and not too heavy.  At first the different modes didn&#x27;t seem to be all that different, everything was just brain-rattling, but now I can feel the different pulsing patterns in the vibrations in each mode.  They all have different names, but I don&#x27;t know if those really relate to what they&#x27;re doing, so I just try different ones on different days for a little variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The induction charging base is a really great feature.  Induction charging is the new rage with cell phones, but Sonicares have had it for years.  It means there are no batteries to change, and the body is at least water resistant, if not entirely watertight (it may be, I don&#x27;t know! I&#x27;m not risking it!).  This also means its easier to keep clean, so when you do spew toothbrush foam all over your bathroom the first time you use it, just a quick pass under the faucet will clean it right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are quick to swap out, just pop it off and pop it on, this means that my partner can use the same toothbrush with a different head, because EW, GERMS!  Convenient!</li>
    <li> If properly used, the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes are great at keeping your teeth and gums healthy. This particular model has additional bells and whistles that I personally do not use, which is why I docked a star due to what I feel is an unnecessary incremental cost.  Specifically, I only use two of the five settings: &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Refresh.&amp;#34;  The &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; setting sets the toothbrush up for four 30-second periods (for a total of the recommended two minutes) and the &amp;#34;Refresh&amp;#34; setting sets the toothbrush up for four 15-second periods (for a total of one minute).  The Refresh setting may be helpful in between brushings with no meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other three settings, &amp;#34;Gum Care,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Sensitive,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Massage,&amp;#34; I do not find too useful.  For example, the &amp;#34;Gum Care&amp;#34; setting takes 3 minutes because after doing the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; cycle it gives you an extra minute to massage the gums.  With the sonic vibrations, this just feels awkward to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, together with regular flossing, properly using this Sonicare toothbrush will contribute greatly to your dental health.</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush.  It&#x27;s not the first Sonicare I have used, and they&#x27;re all really nice.  This one comes with some features I&#x27;d call &#x27;questionable&#x27;.  There are several brushing modes which basically change the duration of the brush time.  I am unclear as to why I need a toothbrush to tell me how long to brush different areas of my mouth.  I don&#x27;t use any of these features, so if you are price shopping, I&#x27;d say go for one of the cheaper ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an included travel case, and again...really?  If I travel, I pack a regular toothbrush for those few days and leave the Sonic at home.  Unless you are on the road a LOT, this is another feature that adds to the cost and is of little use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is smaller than the ones on other Sonicares I have used, so if you have trouble getting to all of your teeth, this one is worth a look.  But, really, I would strongly suggest you look at one of the less expensive models and compare features.</li>
    <li> I know my teeth are happier, but I still have trouble with the tickle on my top front teeth. With a compact head, this is manageable. I hope the dentist is pleased in 6 months. Having sensitive and massage modes are helping me with the transition, so although this was expensive, I&#x27;m happy about the training options.</li>
    <li> Some years ago when my wife had oral surgery, her periodontist recommended a change to an electric toothbrush, and the top of the line Philips Sonicare at that time became her weapon of choice. No surprise then that after her successful surgery and successful maintenance with the Sonicare that she began recommending I switch. I balked at the high price and continued with my manual brush, until (of course) my dentist noticed some bone loss and sent me to the same periodontist for a similar procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare, here I come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was well over two years ago, having started with my wife&#x27;s brush, then moved on to my own, [[ASIN:B00CUG2582 Philips Sonicare HX9110/02 Flexcare Platinum Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] about a year ago, which I bought on the strength of its three different settings at three different power levels, offering the user nine choices for cleaning teeth, massaging gums and strengthening oral tissue. Which is to say, this new brush with only five modes at first seems a step down from the 3x3 brush I had been using, but after over a week of using this one, I&#x27;m already convinced this is the better brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, the main modes are the same, most lasting two minutes and signaling you every thirty seconds to change your area of focus.  If you are already used to an electric toothbrush, you don&#x27;t gain anything with the Flexcare Platinum brush, because you probably aren&#x27;t going to need or use the low power settings on any of the modes, unless you have particularly sensitive teeth or some other oral health issues. What I definitely like on the new brush is the massage mode, which is a genuine variable massage pattern. That is to say, instead of turning on the brush and running it over the areas you want to massage, it actually pulsates in less regular patterns and strengths and moves more in three dimensions. It feels great. I&#x27;ve been using the normal clean mode to brush and then using massage for an extra minute or two. I love the way it makes my teeth feel. Of course, all the usual Flexcare accoutrements and features are here: hard plastic travel case, clear plastic brush covers, travel worthy charger with two brush head stand and comfortable, ergonomically designed handle. A big selling point is also the display, which clearly indicates mode, battery level, and whether it is on or off. It charges quickly and holds charge for several days, which means you might even be able to leave the charger at home for short trips. As always, the brush heads are interchangeable, so you can go with something basic or something a little more advance, as your heart desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may not have a doctor recommended need for an electric toothbrush, and you may think a $0.69 brush and your elbow grease is enough to keep you in good oral health. And, you may be right. But if your dentist or doctor has suggested an electric toothbrush and you&#x27;re wondering where to start, I think this may be the brush for you. You will like the performance and feel, and the five modes are enough for even a finicky user. Honestly, I consider the massage mode alone worthy of five stars, but since this toothbrush even won me over from a more expensive, more tricked out brush from the same company and care line, I&#x27;m more or less compelled to give this one the highest possible rating.te or two.

    <li> My dentist had recommended Sonicare to me, and told me that any model that comes with their Quadpacer timer would be fine.  You basically divide your mouth into four sections, and the brush will notify you every 30 seconds so that you can switch to brushing a different section.  It seems kind of silly and trivial, but it really has gotten me to brush more consistently.  I always brush for the full two minutes now, and each corner of my mouth gets a full 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the less expensive Sonicare Easy Clean model for about 6 months now, and I jumped at the chance to upgrade to the Flexcare Plus.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been pretty disappointed with the extra features that comes with the Flexcare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is NOT the same as the USB charging case, in case [sic] anyone is wondering.  It&#x27;s just a plain, plastic, clam shell case that will hold the toothbrush and the two brush heads.  The Flexcare Plus and my old Easy Clean actually have the same charging base, but now it&#x27;s called the travel charger.  The Flexcare Plus also comes with a wider, plastic, snap-on base that you clip around the travel charger to give it a wider footprint along with two holders for extra brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare not only has the regular brushing mode with Quadpacer, but it also offers modes for gum care, refresh, sensitive, and massage.  They basically offer different vibration settings and cleaning patterns.  If you have incredibly sensitive teeth and gums, then you might find some value in buying a Sonicare model that offers different intensity settings, but I feel like the regular cleaning mode on these brushes is gentle enough for most people.  I tend to get sensitive spots on my teeth and gums, and I&#x27;ve never had any issues with my Easy Clean model being too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Flexcare Plus is still a great toothbrush, but I feel like the extra features are going to go unused for most people.  If you travel a lot, you really should splurge for the high-end model that comes with the USB charger.  Otherwise, I think the basic Easy Clean model is definitely the best bang for your buck.hould splurge for the high-end model that comes with the USB charger.

    <li> In January, 2009, I purchased a Philips Sonicare Essence electric toothbrush from Amazon.  And although Philips has moved on to other models, my original Sonicare is still going strong.  I expect the new Philips Sonicare Flexcare Plus to live up to this standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexicare has five brushing modes:  clean, gumcare, refresh, sensitive, and massage.  I asked my dentist and his hygenist if the massage mode was safe to use and got a resounding &#x27;yes!&#x27;  In fact, this is the same electric toothbrush that the hygenist recently purchased.&lt;br /&gt;She suggested that if the new bristles seem a bit too firm, that running warm water over them for a few minutes while they&#x27;re new would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the slim handle that this model has (my old one was  bit clunky).  And I like the interval timer.  To be honest, it&#x27;s the only way that I brush for a full two minutes.  And the interval beeps do help me give each section its due.  My dentist commented that some of his more zealous patients tend to overbrush (so not my problem!) and that the shut off after two minutes is a worthwhile precaution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips says that the battery lasts three weeks between charges and they include a plastic travel case for the brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of brush heads, they do need to be replaced after three months of regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My check ups truly have improved since I&#x27;ve been using a Philips Sonicare and my teeth really do look whiter and feel smoother.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter, she loves it</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I use this type of brush, so i don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. I like it very much. It feels that my teeth are really clean after using it. I like that it has different settings that I can use, depending on my needs: Clean, Refresh, Gum Care, Sensitive and Massage. I like that it &amp;#34;pauses&amp;#34; and beeps when I have to change to a different area of my mouth and it keeps the time so that I brush for two minutes. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Love This Toothbrush!!,lot&amp;#34;s Of Nice Features Does A Great Job Cleaning ,,The Gums &amp; Teeth .Can See Now Why?  It&amp;#34;s A Dentist&amp;#34;s Number One Choice.!!</li>
    <li> Although I was initially unsure of the product, after several weeks use I&#x27;ve fallen in love with this toothbrush! My skepticism derived from how different the Sonicare feels from an Oral B it replaced. The Philips brush head is quite a bit smaller, and the two brands have a much different brushing sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You feel the vibration from the Philips Sonicare more acutely, almost as if the brush is moving faster (but it’s not unpleasant) while its touch at the same time seems lighter and more delicate. Perhaps in recognition, Philips has an “easy start” – the brush “gently increases power over its first 14 brushings” to allow you to become accustomed to its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare does very well at cleaning your teeth, as one would expect. But its gum care mode really won me over. My dentist noticed initial signs of gingivitis, and the Sonicare is superb at gum care. The brush has a slower, light gum massage mode that’s become part of my regular brushing routine. It reduces inflammation and bleeding along the gum line and generally stimulates your soft tissue, leaving your mouth feeling exceptionally fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any product complaints are truly minor. As noted, the brush is small, so sometimes toothpaste needs to be re-applied. And the base fits fairly loosely on the charger, so much so that until you’re familiar with it, you’ll wonder if it’s actually re-charging. Bonus – the brush comes charged and ready to go right out of the box!</li>
    <li> Our whole family uses Sonicare toothbrushes, from the 7 year old all the way up through mom and dad. The toothbrushes were recommended by our dentist and work great. The timer on the toothbrush is perfect for a child (or an adult) that may not normally be brushing for the recommended amount of time. My youngest daughter just started using this toothbrush about a month ago and just came back from the dentist this week with a report of no cavities. These toothbrushes are great and really are worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Of all the electric toothbrushes I have owned, this is the best!</li>
    <li> This is my second sonicare of this model, after my first one finally died after almost 6 years of use.  This is a great toothbrush, and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> Good product &amp; great delivery</li>
    <li> This is my second sonic care.  My first one died after 10 years of use.  So far I like this model and it features.</li>
    <li> I have used a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush for over 5 years and received good service from it. BUT this new Flexcare Plus with 5 settings (Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage) is so much better. I have a tendency toward flareups with gingivitis and the gum setting is just perfect for keeping my gums healthy. The brush head contains 4 kinds of brush tips to effectively deliver the difference in settings plus remind you when you need a new brush head. The toothbrush itself is much thinner than the older models with a really pro sleek design. The battery charge lasts up to 3 weeks which makes it easy to travel with or without the charger. Included in the package is a hard plastic travel case, home  charger with chord wrap and brush head storage and travel charger, one brush head with travel cover cap.I have enjoyed my older model and I expect to enjoy this even more. Reliable and dependable product by Philips Sonicare. Comes with a 2 year warranty and a 30 day money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> This is the second Sonicare toothbrush that I have used and I was actually surprised at the differences between the two. We also have the Sonicare Flexcare Premium versions, so the chargers and heads are all interchangeable. This one also comes with a travel case, which works great, and the head can fit in the UV cleaner that is a part of our other set. Whereas our other version has some of the same settings, this one has some unique ones - like the three minute long version just for gum care. Like our other Sonicares, this one leaves teeth feeling much cleaner than your average toothbrush. The Flexcare head on this version is different from the diamond head and has more varied lengths of bristles. There is a built-in timer that changes in vibration that alerts you when to switch from back-front to back-back to top-front to top-back. There is a sensitive setting as well, and some quicker versions too that are only a minute rather than the standard two minutes that is built in. This is such a great system for tooth cleaning and so much less abrasive than standard electric toothbrushes because it never hurts your teeth and leaves them feeling so clean.</li>
    <li> I have had extensive dental work and my dentist and his assistant both recommended that I use a Sonicare.  I have another one that is a different model and I really can&#x27;t tell that much difference.  I was excited about them gum care mode but I think it&#x27;s similar to other options on the other ones.  Your teeth really will feel so clean after brushing with this. And my dentist said it will really help my gums.  I have extremely sensitive teeth and gums and it can feel a little hard on them sometimes but the dentist said to stick with it and it would get better.  So, I will do that.  I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on these teeth so I want to maintain what I&#x27;ve had done and have healthy gums.</li>
    <li> Love, love this toothbrush!!!! It&#x27;s definitely more gentle than the Braun Oral B electric toothbrush I&#x27;d been using. I did a little research about Phillips vs. Oral B debate, and many sources cited the Phillips Sonicare as the preferred brand due to the sonic wave cleaning method  which is a high vibration of the bristles as opposed to the Oral B which employs an oscillating method. By the way, there were plenty of dental reviews that gave the thumbs up to Oral B, so it really comes down to personal choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how much easier it was to brush the back of my teeth with the smaller oval head of the Phillips toothbrush. This slimmer profile was much more comfortable for my smaller mouth compared to the chunky, squarish shape of the Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a rundown of the features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Multiple Modes - depending on whether you need a quickie freshening up or you&#x27;ve got early signs of gum disease, you can select a mode that beep when the brushing sequence is completed. It also has this cool Easy Start mode which over the course of 14 days will gradually increase the intensity of brushing - really helpful if you&#x27;re new to electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;- Cord Wrap - love, love this feature!!! This might seem trivial, but I&#x27;d prefer my bathroom countertop not to looks like my computer desktop with cords all over the place. With this set-up, you pop the charging base top and wrap the cord to take up the slack (yeah! no more twisty ties to keep the cords contained!). By the way the cord is reasonably generous if your outlet isn&#x27;t conveniently located.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to Clean - I love that this toothbrush handle is so smooth, not full of jagged angles, edges and pieces, cleaning it a whole lot easier. My old Oral B had so many nooks and crannies and mineral deposits would build up quickly and it looked like something was growing on it (yuck!).&lt;br /&gt;- Nice Handle - anyone with smaller hands will really like this toothbrush, easy to grip and hold, and on the super plus side, it is lighter in weight than my old Oral B. I had my husband use it, and even with his big mitts he was surprised at how much he liked the weight and feel too.&lt;br /&gt;- Sound is Reasonably Pleasant - again comparing to the Oral B, the Phillips has a much nicer, almost soothing white noise sound especially compared to the high-pitched grinding sound of the Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;- Killer Battery Life - while I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try it, the information states this toothbrush has a 3-week battery life which if it holds out for a solid two weeks, it&#x27;s a winner for traveling. I never took my other toothbrush since I didn&#x27;t want to have to bother with the charging base. If the Phillips doesn&#x27;t live up to this claim, I will definitely update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, I really dislike the glowing blue light, and in general, I wish electronics manufacturers would really rethink the need to have a glowing light that stays on constantly on every device (this goes for the beeping thing too). At least make it an option to turn off. I find this especially disruptive at night, and I ended up putting a towel over the handle to avoid seeing it. Sorry, I&#x27;m off the soap box now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note, if you purchase this toothbrush, definitely take a minute or two to read the directions, especially those pertaining to how to brush. In the research, I found several that cited many users tend to use these devices improperly which can cause more damage to your gums.

    <li> I am a strong believer in electric toothbrushes.  Everyone in my family has one, including the children. I have only ever used Sonicare toothbrushes myself and I have loved them.  This toothbrush (as seen in the description above) has five different modes: Clean, GumCare, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage.  I haven&#x27;t had the toothbrush long enough to use any mode but Clean.  I imagine the Refresh is to use it in the middle of the day to just Refresh the &#x27;ol breath, but I couldn&#x27;t say for sure.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this unit is that it doesn&#x27;t have the UV cleaning like my other Sonicare.  I really liked that.  I suppose that I could use the one I still have, but I&#x27;m not sure what it would do to the brush itself.  It only came with the smaller brush, which I appreciated because it is easier to reach the hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other that that, this is a great unit, and to a consumer that is paying for this unit, it is well worth the price because of the modes, the battery life and because, this thing will last you forever.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using sonic toothbrushes for some time now. Stating with the Sonicare and then moving to a Panasonic for a while. The Panasonic was a good brush but once trying a Sonicare, it is obvious why it continues to be the industry best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Sonicare HX6921/04 Flexcare Plus it absolutely the best sonic toothbrush we&#x27;ve owned. It continues to excel at cleaning and reducing dental problems and plaque scraping during dental checkups. The timers are great and perfect for the recommended brushing times. The one thing I am impressed about the most on this model is the options for the kind of teeth you have. It has modes for clean, gum care, refresh, sensitive, massage. I love the sensitive mode combined with sensitive toothpaste. It has really helped in easing and even controlling the discomfort of sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t need the extra modes, a model down would suffice for you but I highly recommend this model for all needs.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this brush.  I can feel the difference between the Sonicare and a manual.  It&#x27;s kind of annoying that it powers down after 120 seconds, but that&#x27;s easily remedied.  But, it&#x27;s gentle on the gums and leaves my teeth feeling amazing, so I am very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I also bought another Sonicare brush that was twice as expensive as this one, but the Flexcare Plus is all you need.  Additional features aka different vibration speeds aren&#x27;t worth it, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> We have been using Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for quite a few years and have had great checkups at the dentist as a result. This particular brush is a newer version with the one-piece brush attachment rather than the older, harder to keep clean two-piece attachment that we had previously[[ASIN:B00JB2QPDY Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, White]]. The power unit of this brush is also a little bit slimmer and seems to have more power than our old one. Another reviewer complained that the brush didn&#x27;t seem as powerful as their old one; could be they forgot to read the instructions on how to disable the Easy Start \\&quot;ramp up\\&quot; feature for new users. You can also disable the Quadpacer timer that signals when to switch brushing the 4 sections of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case with the convertible charger is also pretty useful, although Sonicare claims the brush will hold a charge for an average vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have had pretty good service from our past Sonicares, with our old one still running well after 5 years use, and hope this one goes the distance too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience with Sonicare brushes for many years, I would recommend this brush to anyone looking to improve their dental checkups.</li>
    <li> This is my second sonic. The first one lasted 5 years.  I will not use anything  other toothbrush now.  My teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean with anything else. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great quality overall, but seems to not have as strong of a &amp;#34;vibration&amp;#34; as other Sonicare toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicare products for 20 years now and I&#x27;d never go back. Sonicare is as close as you can get to a dentist-clean at home, every day and the difference it&#x27;s made in my bi-yearly dental check-ups is incalculable. I used to be consantly berated at appointments for tarter build-up, despite religious brushing and flossing and use of special tarter-control pastes (apparently I&#x27;m just genetically predisposed to it); but once I started using Sonicare, even as I&#x27;ve aged, I&#x27;ve had no more issues. My teeth feel and look cleaner and on the rare occasions I have to use a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toothbrush nowadays, my mouth just never feels clean to me. Once you use Sonicare, there really is no comparison. (My son, 7, has used the Sonicare kids since he was old enough to brush and he&#x27;s, knock wood, never had a cavity. We&#x27;re an all-Sonicare family here.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our standby for the past six years now has been the previous top-of-the-line model, [[ASIN:B002CVTVVY Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], which my husband and I both use daily (with separate brush heads; one of the benefits of the Sonicare system).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new model isn&#x27;t quite the current top-of-the-line, but it has almost all the bells and whistles, minus the charging glass, which gets very mixed reviews, and the USB travel case, which I don&#x27;t see a huge need for, as we take our Sonicare on all trips and it&#x27;s lasted up to two weeks without charging with zero issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this, like all new model Sonicares we&#x27;ve tried over the years, seems a small step up from the previous already-great version. There aren&#x27;t any big form factor changes this time out, though it does boast better battery life (which is nice), a hard travel case (which I actually like less than the smaller, soft case the old one had but could be beneficial for those who have had issues having their toothbrush turn on in their luggage) and a somewhat restructured charging base, which is smaller and easier to keep clean, so that&#x27;s a plus. I do miss the UV light cleaning system our old FlexCare system had, and wonder why they discontinued it, as I used to put our brush heads in there every time I charged the base, hoping it would do at least a little. (Of course, maybe it didn&#x27;t really work, which is why the axed it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The programs are also basically the same as previous FlexCare models. I mostly use \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, though if you remember to do it, the gum massage is also good, especially as I get set to enter my 40s (gulp) and have to start worrying more about gum health. There is a 2-minute timer on the standard cycle, the ideal brushing length, with 30 second buzzing reminders to make sure you spend equal times on all four quadrants in your mouth. All helpful and subtle reminders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that this brush leaves my teeth feeling even cleaner and fresher than my old model, which is fairly typical of a Sonicare model upgrade: as good as they always are, the next one always seems to be a bit better. We typically change our brush heads every three months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New or old, the FlexCare is, by far, the best of the Sonicare line -- and I&#x27;ve had half a dozen models over the years -- and I can&#x27;t recommend the brush system highly enough. It&#x27;s expensive, but worth every penny.er and easier to keep clean, so that&#x27;s a plus.

    <li> I purchased a Sonicare Flexcare Plus last year, and it had a blue rubberized coating whereas this is entirely white. After a full year of usage, there will be some film that builds up at the bottom where water drips and collects. This causes the bottom to turn yellow, so just be aware of this and keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no mechanical moving parts with these brushes, the brush head just \\&quot;vibrates\\&quot; rapidly causing the toothpaste/fluid mixture to agitate and flow through gum lines and in-between teeth, while the brush works gently and rapidly to remove stains/debris from the teeth. I watched YouTube videos demonstrating how to use the Diamond Clean Sonicare system, bottom line is that I am truly impressed with the performance of Sonicare after using it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B wasn&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;as clean\\&quot; after using those brushes. The Oral-B system is similar to a random orbital buffer, where the brush head rotates back/forth rapidly. There are numerous Oral-B brushes but I always found myself using the Oral-B Sensitive and Precision clean, and never liked the Floss Action or Tri-Action heads. The brushes cleaned my teeth but it always felt like it was rather rough on my gums and teeth without being able to get into the deeper nooks/crannies. The Sonicare system seems (at least in my opinion) to agitate the fluid enough to allow it to clean other areas that a brush normally cannot reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased compact Diamond Clean heads after extensively researching Sonicare&#x27;s confusing line of brush heads, before I actually bought a Sonicare toothbrush. I noticed the Diamond Clean was the most expensive but highly rated tooth brush available, with 7x the cleaning power. I was curious to see what differences (if any) there were with the actual Diamond Clean tooth brush versus a less expensive model such as the Essence or Flexcare series. I quickly found that most of these brush heads are compatible with the Flexcare and Diamond Clean, with the Essence being a low-budget line. There didn&#x27;t seem to be a difference in performance between the Flexcare Plus or the Diamond Clean toothbrushes, so I ordered and received the Flexcare, and used the compact Diamond Head brush for my teeth. The Diamond Clean seemed to just have a fancy USB-charger for the travel case and a fancy rinsing glass/charger base, and would come with full-sized Diamond Clean heads. There&#x27;s nothing wrong, but it was substantially more expensive than the Flexcare Plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare Plus comes with a single full-sized ProResults brush, which I felt was too big and I didn&#x27;t like the feel. The compact Diamond Clean has a much higher bristle density, with lots of tiny bristles packed into an area for maximum cleaning. The smaller size allowed me to focus on tight spots as well as cover the larger surface areas (flat parts of teeth, biting surfaces, etc...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare Plus comes with a charger base that also includes a travel charger with a base that you can wrap the power cord around. The Flexcare Plus utilizes a Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) battery pack, that should be good for at least 2-5 years. I would have preferred a Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery because they have a longer lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare Plus is quieter than the Oral-B Triumph and Precision Care series brushes. It&#x27;s basically the same difference between using an electric hair trimmer with and without the attachment installed: a high frequency mosquito \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; (Sonicare) versus mechanical parts moving back/forth rapidly (Oral-B). If I accidentally touch my tongue or lip on the Sonicare brush head, it sort of feels tingly due to the vibration from the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, I am very impressed with Sonicare! There are no moving parts on the brush head, it relies on high frequency \\&quot;vibration\\&quot; of the head which results in a brushing action as well as agitates the toothpaste/fluid to clean your gums and teeth. Since I&#x27;vealready been using Oral-B for over 15 years, I am not new to electric toothbrushes and didn&#x27;t have any problems adjusting to Sonicare immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year of using the Sonicare, I can say that the Sonicare Flexcare Plus with the compact Diamond Clean brush does a much better job at whitening and cleaning than the Oral B. However, the Oral B is easier to use in corners/tight spots as well as behind the front teeth. The Diamond Clean in compact is much easier to maneuver compared to the full sized Sonicare brushes, but it is still a bit awkward for tight spots or behind the front teeth.already been using Oral-B for over 15 years, I am not new to electric toothbrushes and didn&#x27;t have any problems adjusting to Sonicare immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year of using the Sonicare, I can say that the Sonicare Flexcare Plus with the compact Diamond Clean brush does a much better job at whitening and cleaning than the Oral B.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for many years now and swear by the brand. Aside from one model that had a barrel-type handle, ALL of them have been fantastic. The latest models are even better and worth the upgrade. This model, versus the more expensive HX9381/05, gets you basically the same cleaning action and modes - which are all fantastic. Probably the only downside to switching modes is that you have to know the order of them since you the lights/diagram face toward you as your turn on the handle and brush your teeth - this makes it difficult to know what you&#x27;ve switched to. This is hardly a deal breaker but the only negative thing I could say. Otherwise, I love the cleaning modes - the quick one is great and the longer one for gum stimulation is good for giving your teeth an extra polish (if you don&#x27;t use it for gum stimulation).&lt;br /&gt;The main difference between this and the 05 unit is the travel case. the 05 travel case is REALLY nice - attractive, modern and USB chargeable. The 04 has a standard plastic carrying case which is fine for travel. I personally prefer the the nicer one - you have to decide if it means more to you to have the charging and beautiful case or not.&lt;br /&gt;The charging base of this unit has a top that comes off. The top adds two spots to hold additional brushes if you&#x27;re sharing the base with someone else. Or you can just take it off and use it like the standard charger bases that come with most Sonicares.</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrush. However, it only comes with 1 brush head.</li>
    <li> If you are using a regular toothbrush then you aren&#x27;t doing your teeth a favor.  If you buy a good quality electric toothbrush you can really improve your teeth and gum health.  I&#x27;ve had a number of these over the years and this model seems as good as any of them.  The main competition for Phillips is the Oral-B line of brushes.  Consumer Reports did a comparison a few years back and found the best models from Philips and Oral-B to be fairly equivalent: the both do a great job of getting your teeth clean.  There was a small but measurable difference between the high and low end brushes from Philips and Oral-b, but even the cheapest brush is much, much better than a traditional toothbrush.  So don’t bust your budget buying the top-end brush.  I compared this to my wife’s Diamond Clean brush and both seem to clean equally well, though that is a largely subjective opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I prefer the Oral-B (if only slightly), which has a spinning and vibrating brush: though I have no evidence it helps, the spinning brush just seems to make sense to me.  My wife finds that the Oral-B is too rough and loud (and it is), and prefers this Philips, which is just a vibrating brush.  Though I prefer the Oral-B, I think most people would rather have the Philips just because it is a lot quieter.  Either way it&#x27;s a major improvement over a manual brush.  They may seem expensive, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to the cost and pain of filling cavities or getting a root canal.  I went from a cavity every year to zero cavities since I started using these over six years ago.  I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> -Philips Sonicare HX6921/04 Flexcare Plus-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this toothbrush as well as the higher end DiamondClean model for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that I prefer this model over the more expensive DiamondClean model because it feels more ergonomic and is easier to operate. Witht the Flexcare plus you can simpy push the on/off button to start or stop the toothbrush. With the DiamondClean model you must cycle through all five brushing modes in order to turn it off before it turns off automatically with the timer. I find this very annoying. Additionally, you can use the same superior DiamondClean brushes with this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No issues - Would recommend - would repeat</li>
    <li> I resisted getting an electric toothbrush for years. Did I really need that hassle? However, my dentist finally talked me into it. It&#x27;s not like she sells the toothbrushes, and she&#x27;s the best dentist I&#x27;ve ever had, so I was willing to take her advice. Then it was kismet that this opportunity for an electric toothbrush became available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this toothbrush on the sensitive setting because my teeth are ridiculously prone to discomfort from hot and cold. This toothbrush has a lot of the bells and whistles many of them have, such as different settings and a little stutter when it&#x27;s time to switch sides. My teeth don&#x27;t exactly feel cleaner than they do after manually brushing (and my dentist warned me of this) but they feel cleaner longer after. My teeth don&#x27;t feel quite as in need of a good brushing at night as they used to. I think that&#x27;s probably the best endorsement of an electric toothbrush that I can give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about constantly having to plug this toothbrush in, but it goes weeks without needing a recharge. The battery gauge light on the front of the unit lets you know when it&#x27;s time to recharge. It also comes with a handy case, which keeps the entire works clean and enclosed (because we all know your toothbrush shouldn&#x27;t be left exposed in the bathroom!). It&#x27;s easy to change settings on the lighted display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a solid toothbrush that has made the chore of finally switching to an electric toothbrush a bit easier. The multiple settings make it worthwhile for people who have complicated dental problems.</li>
    <li> I own many Sonicare toothbrushes. From the base model to the top end DiamondClean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit like all the others claims a 31,000 brush strokes per minute. This is the case from the cheapest model, right up to the most expensive model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a claimed battery life of 3 weeks for this unit, but brushing twice a day brings a realistic 8 days before being notified of an impending charge, and 11 days until no more brushing. One of the perks of the higher end models is that they have Lithium Ion batteries. Additionally the higher end models have the quadpacer which the low end units do not. I recommend moving to the base model with the quadpacer and using that as your entry point to the Sonicare line. At this time, it would be the HealthyWhite series, which also have the Lithium batteries. I really only use the clean mode, so the gained two modes I see little benefit. FWIW, this is the first model I’ve owned which has a dedicated button to select the brushing mode. Other models require multiple presses of the power button. Sure the travel cases are nice, but you can figure something else out. The DiamondClean heads can be used on ANY model of Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Sonicare toothbrushes before and this is just as reliable. I like the new stand with the space to store extra lengths of power cord. It seems more stable too. As for the brush itself, the timer to tell you to switch quadrants is nice, but I&#x27;d like it in 15 second intervals too to switch sides of my mouth. Adding the gum massage at the end of brushing is a nice touch as my dentist has recommended that. I just wish it paused a second after the brushing cycle to let me spit out the toothpaste first. Overall a pretty good toothbrush though.</li>
    <li> I will never use anything but an electric toothbrush, and Sonicare is the best brand there is. This is a great product: easy to use, high quality, and it really works. My gums are healthier and my teeth are whiter/brighter!</li>
