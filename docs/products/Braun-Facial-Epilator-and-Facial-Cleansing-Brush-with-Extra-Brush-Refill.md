      <li>I got this product free from bzzagent.com by agree to honestly review how it worked!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s work very good and easily used</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also best to wash your face in the shower as your pores are really open and if you have a special face soap, it&#x27;s best to apply there for best effects.</li>
      <li>I received this kit from BzzAgent and I am super impressed!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with this product and am pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>all I was very pleased.</li>

      <li>It is safe to use in the shower and I like that!</li>
      <li>The battery life isn&#x27;t the best, but it just takes AA batteries which most everyone has in their household, and for the convince of this thing, it is definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>I will be using that attachment for sure!</li>
      <li>My favorite part of this product is the cleansing brush!  </li>
      <li>your sure to save!</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!!</li>
      <li>The cleansing brush is great though; the setup is easy, all you do to switch to the cleansing brush or epilator</li>
      <li>, it was nice to be able to take it out of box pop battery in and try it out!</li>
      <li>Works great, leaves my skin smooth and even grabs hair</li>
      <li>My face felt amazing after using it my face was</li>
      <li>It works amazingly.</li>
      <li>I own a clarisonic, and I would every time pick that over this.</li>
      <li>I thought the epilator was effective.</li>
      <li>I liked the product.</li>
      <li>but that was my own fault</li>
      <li>So this is my own fault.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s nice to have two uses in one item.  </li>
      <li>it is a nice side-use.  </li>
      <li>Your face will feel wonderful after using them clean and baby smooth.</li>
      <li>Especially right under my nose.  </li>
      <li>Ok so i received this product free via Buzzagent which was great by the way.</li>
      <li>The cleansing head and the epilator head are very easily changed without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it was very easy to put together and take apart.</li>
      <li>I love this product and am grateful I was able to try it out!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the product is nice, I love the epilator</li>
      <li>It is easy to get used to!  </li>
      <li>very pleased with my Braun Epilator, and how quickly it arrived!</li>
      <li>Braun has always been a great name related to shaving products, so this fell in line with their great reputation.  </li>
      <li>Another reason why i loved it so much is because it&#x27;s shower safe!</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>So many products do not.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s an interesting concept.</li>
      <li>The epilator is useful, and the brush appears to be good too.</li>
      <li>For the price it should probably be a bit better than this.</li>
      <li>I love the cleaning brush and have been using it every night.</li>
      <li>come to expect more from the Braun name.</li>
      <li>I love the brush part for cleaning your face, but I had quite a time with the epilator.</li>
      <li>and I was able to get 90% of the hair I wanted to remove</li>
      <li>I will update my review after more</li>
      <li>It removes even the tiniest hairs and leaves it nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Ive tried SOOOOOO many things to get rid of the hair on my chin-waxing, electrolysis, laser hair removal, tweezing.</li>
      <li>Was hoping for a much better product from a well acclaimed brand.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this for free to try, I must say I was a little apprehensive but I love the results. My face looks a lot cleaner and brighter than before.</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion for the product and I love it I it does just as it says I have been have tried it several times you may have to go over the very fine hair more than once but it gets the job done it stings a little and makes the skin red but my skin was back to normal by the next morning the cleaning brush is soft but it cleans well you have to use a good moisturizer afterwards but your skin stay smooth and fresh ..</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion about a week ago and I love it. The epilator is able to remove even the finest hairs and it is almost painless. The battery also lasts a very long time. I had minor redness after using it but that quickly faded after a few minutes. The cleansing brush works more effective than any of my other cleansing brushes. It is gentle but very effective and works very well to thoroughly clean your face. Overall this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and received this as a promotional gift. I really like it! The facial brush does a really good job at cleaning my face. The epilator works very well. It is a little painful, but well worth it. Keeps your face very soft.</li>
    <li> I recently received this Item as a promotion through bzzagent to review this Product for Braun, and well I have to say as an Exfoliator it was great especially on my skin which is pretty sensitive. But my biggest complaint about this product would be that as an epilator it simply did not get the job done I went over and over on the same spots and it just was not pulling out the hair and it started to heat up also after the first use the battery drained which was kind of annoying so with that said cleansing brush thumbs up Epilator not so great.</li>
    <li> I recieved the Braun Epilator 820 from the Braun company. It works amazingly. It hurts when its pulling your skin at the beginning...however, your skin gets used to it and the second or third time that you do it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much. I don&#x27;t longer have to use it as much because my hair doesn&#x27;t grow as often!!!! it is a great product! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Like many others who posted reviews, I received free as a promotion.  I have facial hair- mostly upper lip issues so have wanted to try a new epilator.  I&#x27;ve tried the gamut of hair removal products: bleaching, waxing, hair trimming, etc,. and this epilator is not only easier than most of those, but the results last much longer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over month and I think this is the way I&#x27;m going to tackle facial hair from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, it does sting just a tiny bit as you get used to it.  And there is a bit of a learning curve in terms of proper use.  The directions in the package will steer you in terms of how to get started- like beginning on areas of the face that are least sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this doubles as a facial cleansing brush is more of an added bonus to me.  I&#x27;ve used that part every other day and have noticed that the brush got my face cleaner than just with a washcloth or my hands.  I personally don&#x27;t think the price tag warrants this purchase if you&#x27;re solely looking for a cleansing brush.  I also knocked off one star because I think a price tag of $60 is more what I would pay.  But if you&#x27;re looking for an easy hair removal product- I think you&#x27;ll be very happy with the Braun Epilator.  Considering if you&#x27;re paying for the bleaching kits or trips to a salon for waxing- you&#x27;re probably going to end up saving money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve never used one and having never used one it does take some getting used to but the product did just as it promised. I even let my 8 yr old use the face cleansing brush and she loved it. Best part of all is I got this product free from bzzagent.com by agree to honestly review how it worked!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun facial epilator and cleansing brush for about 2 weeks now, I received it free from the brand thru bzz agent. First off I would like to say thanks Braun for including battery, it was nice to be able to take it out of box pop battery in and try it out! I have sensitive skin and was nervous about it but it honestly wasn&#x27;t that bad, at first it was more uncomfortable but once I got use to it I was fine. Works great, leaves my skin smooth and even grabs hair I couldn&#x27;t see!! The facial brush is an added bonus, I use my facial cleaner with it and it leaves my face feeling clean. My only complaint is that it is battery operated and when the battery starts dying it does hurt a little worse, would be great if it was rechargeable but overall I would recommend this product to anyone. Much less painful than threading and waxing and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin red!</li>
    <li> I recently received this item from a campaign on Bzzagent! I&#x27;d never heard of or used any products from the Braun brand, but I&#x27;d read several reviews both good and bad. When I first opened up my epilator I checked out the cleansing brush that came with it. The brush is soft and of decent quality and comes with an extra refill! Next I popped the battery into my epilator with no trouble, other than finding a penny to open the battery cover with. I was a bit nervous to use this at first as I was expecting it to be painful, but found if done properly is bearable. At first it stings slightly until you get used to the feeling I found the tighter I pulled my skin the less painful it felt. It does hurt on the more sensitive areas (upper lip) but is well worth it for smooth hairless skin. Make sure to read all of the instructions before starting just to be sure how to use your epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this on my chin area I was left with slightly red skin, but it quickly faded after a minute or so. I would recommend using it in a small area at first in case of sensitive skin. This epilator really does pull out all the fine hairs and leaves your skin feeling nice and smooth. I&#x27;m unsure if it really lasts up to four weeks since I just started using it, but I&#x27;ll update my review as soon as I find out! I gave it a four star since the battery cover is a little flimsy and could ruin if you&#x27;re not careful. Other than that this product is good quality and works great if you need to quickly get rid of unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion from the brand a little over a week ago. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday. Well, I&#x27;ve been using the cleansing brush everyday. I love the brush attachment! I use my proactiv cleansing products with it to help with breakouts/acne. It makes my face feels clean and fresh. I have seen a difference in the number of black heads I have due to big pores (thanks to my genes lol). They have decreased in numbers just in a week so I know it&#x27;s helping to get deep in there. So I will be continuing to use the cleansing brush attachment (good thing it comes with a second brush attachment to replace the first one after about 3 months!). The epilator attachment on the other hand didn&#x27;t is always a woman&#x27;s foe. I&#x27;m not going to lie, it hurts like hell lol. But all epilators hurt and thats just what I expected. It&#x27;s small head/design gets into the small areas of the face to remove hair. It isn&#x27;t going to remove tiny peach fuze hairs. The hairs have to be long enough for the tweezers to grab onto but I found that it does get relatively small hairs that other epilators I&#x27;ve tried could not. It does pull the hairs from the root making the hair growth time longer. You won&#x27;t have to do it that often. I used it around my eyebrows and my upper lip. You might have to get used to it though. You have to figure out which directions the hairs on your face are growing and which direction works best with the epilator so you don&#x27;t have to spend forever trying to get every hair lol. The first time might take a few tries but you get used to it and the process of, lets say, tweezing your lip becomes relatively fast. It is also easy to clean. However, be careful not to stand it up. I made that mistake and it tipped over and fell on the floor and the side panel where the on/off button is came off but it was easily put back on...with a minor crack lol. It still works perfectly fine though. All in all I do recommend this epilator. It is on the pricier side but Braun is a good company and if you are someone who struggles with facial hair, like me, you could definitely use one of these. Oh and I love that it comes with the battery. So many products do not.</li>
    <li> This is great.  It works well albeit it takes some getting used to.  The epilator is useful, and the brush appears to be good too.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free from the brand to review. I love the cleaning brush and have been using it every night. It is not as soft as I thought it would be but it is effective and leaves my skin feeling clean. It is safe to use in the shower and I like that! As far as the epilator goes... I&#x27;m sure it would work better on a person with fine hair. I am Italian so unfortunately it did not work as well as i would have liked. It got about 50% of the hairs and the rest I waxed. I hope my review helps!</li>
    <li> I like this product it stings a little  but it gets the job done it is quicker than shaving or waxing I used it several times and it did exactly what it said it would do fine hair you might have to go over more than once to get it but it works and the cleansing brush feels so good after you use the Epilator my face was smooth and refreshed it does make the skin red but it mine went away by the next day I used a good moisturizer afterwards and ,my face felt great...a lot better than waxing or shaving you will have to use to experience it for yourself...I received the product as part of a promotion for the brand and I am posting what I thought of the product for others to see that it does everything it said and I like the product..</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion from bzzagent for free! I liked the product. It was a little uncomfortable at first when using the epilator head, but you get used to it. It&#x27;s worth it for up to 4 weeks of no hair! The cleansing brush head is amazing! I used it with my favorite facial cleanser. My skin glows and is much smoother. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this epilator as a promotional product from Bzzagent and I must say so far so good. I have a little bit more hair in abnormal places than the normal lady and I must say I really enjoy this product. I have used waxes, razors, tweezers and everything that you could possibly use without breaking the budget and this is it. It&#x27;s not too bulky in your hands. It doesn&#x27;t vibrate so hard that your hand shakes while holding it. It&#x27;s not loud where others can hear what your doing. It&#x27;s a great hair removal tool. I just wished I had tried something like this sooner than now. Oh and if you use the brush BEFORE you use the epilator, it lifts all the hairs up and makes for an even smoother process.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for about a week now and love it well the cleansing brush part still getting use to the Epilator i have a cleansing brush i was already using but wanted to try this one. At first it felt like it wasn&#x27;t cleaning as good as my other one because you don&#x27;t actual feel it scrubbing like you would imagine it would but after i finished cleansing my face i fell in love,  my face was so soft and felt very clean it was a little red and tender feeling but that was my own fault like I said above I didn&#x27;t feel like it was scrubbing like I imagined it would so I think I over used it but my face was fine the next day and I have used it every day since, my face looks smoother feels softer and cleaner. Now onto the Epilator I have tried it on my chin not to bad pain was bearable and did an amazing job  so I then moved to my upper lip NOPE couldn&#x27;t do it eyes were watering lip was throbbing I&#x27;m gonna stick with waxing the upper lip for a while until I build the courage to do it again I tried between the eyebrows worked well with bearable pain I was scared to try outlining my eyebrows didn&#x27;t wanna slip and remove to many hairs but once I get the hang of it I might try it. I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now and seems the battery is starting to go low the only thing I think would make this product better if it was a rechargeable one instead of having to replace the battery.</li>
    <li> I have been using it now for a few days. I&#x27;m in love with the epilator it really works!!!! I use it to clean my eyebrows and upper lip. The brush works great as well and a total plus that it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 because it&#x27;s compact and I can take it when I travel</li>
    <li> I recently received this product as part of a BzzAgent campaign.  I have used an epilator years ago on my legs, and to come across one for facial use was intriguing. This combination epilator and facial cleansing brush came ready to go with a battery right out of the box.  The epilator worked great on removing those pesky little lip hairs that pop up, as well as taming that unibrow.  The package states that you can use it to contour eyebrows, but admittedly I was a bit scared to do so, since I was afraid of removing too many hairs plus the obvious pain that coincides with hair removal.  The epilator did leave my skin a bit red, however I would suggest maybe using this in the evening before bed, and not before running out the door to work, to give your skin a chance to calm.  Icing the affected area will help quell the redness also.  Braun has always been a great name related to shaving products, so this fell in line with their great reputation.  The epilator can be removed so that the facial cleansing brush can be attached.  The brush was soft but effective.  I use it with my Philosophy cleanser to get a deep clean.  It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and glowing.  Braun has included a second replacement brush for changing after the recommended three months.  All in all it is a great product.  My only complaint was the battery compartment.  It is advised to use a coin to open the compartment, yet the plastic seems a bit soft and a few scratched occurred while opening and closing the area.  Not too much of a complaint, but maybe Braun can look into this design flaw...otherwise I would have given it five stars.  Thanks Braun for thinking of women&#x27;s needs,</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this campaign as i was in dire need of a facial brush as I break out super easily. Now, getting straight to the point, I loved the Cleansing brush, but the epilator was really a painful experience for me. I tried the epilator on my upper lip, but it just hurt too much to continue and had to stop.  The cleansing brush is great though; the setup is easy, all you do to switch to the cleansing brush or epilator is you simply pop off the top piece and exchange. and pop the other piece on. Another reason why i loved it so much is because it&#x27;s shower safe! I can use it in the shower to wash my face, which is so convenient as I usually make a mess on the sink when i wash my face ( water everywhere). It&#x27;s also best to wash your face in the shower as your pores are really open and if you have a special face soap, it&#x27;s best to apply there for best effects.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s work very good and easily used</li>
    <li> This was so simple to use, the instructions were easy to follow as well. As soon as i recieved it i used it! I liked the slim head, it made it precise and simple to move over areas around my lip, chin and between my eye brows! IF you have never used an epilator please realise there is depending on your pain tolerance it could be mild pain to a very loud shout out in pain...pulling out hairs is not a pain free experience so keep that in mind. Also its best to use the epilator in the evening before bed as you will have some reddness on your skin. But what i was most impressed with was the facial cleansing brush! My face felt amazing after using it my face was oh so soft and so so smooth! I also used it to remove make up! A good slathering of my fav miosturizing face cream after right before my head hit the pillow, i found the next day i had no break out like i usually do! I would definately recommend this to any family or friend! If your even the slightest curious about this product do not hesitate! Purchase the item you will not be disappointed in it at all! With less trips to the beauty salon your sure to save! I recieved this free from Braun to review with my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Im really satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> Excellent product as all braun.</li>
    <li> This is a Must-Have Device.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know how to live life without it</li>
    <li> I got this for some fine, blonde hair along the edges of my face. I found that this pretty much chops the hair in half, but doesn&#x27;t smoothly pull them out. It hurts a bit worse than waxing in my opinion too. This is probably great if you have coarse facial hair, but if you are looking at it for fine, light hairs then I&#x27;d stick to waxing/sugaring.</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion from BzzAgent a couple of weeks ago. When I pulled it out of the package it had a nice weight to it and fit well in my hand. The facial brush is heavenly! I use it with my favorite cleanser and my skin feels wonderful! The interchangeable heads are easy to get on and off. The epilator will leave your skin a little red, like most other facial hair removers. But it works quick and if you pull the skin tight it helps a lot. Braun always builds quality products and this is another one that is spot on! I use it every day!</li>
    <li> I read so many reviews before I purchased this product. There were so many positive feed backs, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I was so excited when it came in the mail. And then I used it and was so disappointed. I&#x27;m not overly impressed. It doesn&#x27;t pick up all the short hairs.It doesn&#x27;t even pick up the longer hairs! When I have to use a tweezer, to get a hair off my chin, after using this epilator, something is wrong. The directions are vague, in my opinion. If I don&#x27;t get the hair in one direction, I just switch it to the other side. If I&#x27;m doing something incorrectly, can someone help?</li>
    <li> very pleased with my Braun Epilator, and how quickly it arrived!</li>
    <li> I would rate higher if it was not so time consuming and I have to replace battery often. However, it is better than tweezers.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well I had hoped for hair removal.</li>
    <li> awesome Epilator and facial cleanser. i think it to be the best product one can buy.</li>
    <li> Transaction was perfect. Shipping was prompt and the product arrived in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the the Braun Facial Epilator is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to combat some rogue hairs (both dark and white) that had sprung up over my lip and on my chin. I was tired of constant tweezing and searching for my tweezers.  After using the Braun a couple of times, I now have a &amp;#34;shadow,&amp;#34; like Fred Flinstone&#x27;s, over my lip. Not sure if this will go away if I keep using the product,  but I don&#x27;t want to wait around to find out. I&#x27;ll probably have to bleach until I find another way to keep the hairs in check.</li>
    <li> I love the size of the rotating head - it gets into the small places, and isn&#x27;t so big that I am afraid I will remove an eyebrow.  I love how quick it works compared to plucking or waxing - and, it&#x27;s totally portable, so I can take it on trips.  I just had to figure out which battery would last the longest in it, and once I did that - now, it&#x27;s perfect!  If I have one complaint, it&#x27;s that it uses throw away batteries instead of being rechargeable.  Such a waste, and harm to the environment.  One more star if they come out with a rechargeable model.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to remove facial hair. It stays gone for a couple of weeks too! The only method I like better is threading. It us easy to use.</li>
    <li> The product stops working everytime you replace battery, second time i m getting this product without it working. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does. Hurts like #!@#@ but does a good job.</li>
    <li> i like the product, but I don&#x27;t think its right for me.  I have corse hair, prone to in-growns and I think the epilating cause me to have breakouts on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle, maybe a little too gentle for the efficacy I am seeking.</li>
    <li> works so much better than I had anticipated... be sure to clean your face with alcohol before you use it!</li>
    <li> Have had a month or so. Used few times for epilator. Already replaced batteries but even with that, it runs much slower if I switch dual switch in one direction vs other - and it shouldn&#x27;t make a difference, which means something is already wrong with it. I don&#x27;t see this product lasting very long due to poor product quality.</li>
    <li> The product is good but it needs a new battery after 2-3 times of usage.</li>
    <li> I got the Braun facial epilator thru buzz agent campaign for free to try and review!! I had never used an epilator so I was a little nervous but after quickly popping in the battery I went to work on my chin and upper lip, at first it stung but I quickly got use to the feeling. It does sting worse on the upper lip and eyebrows but is worth it, gets even the finest hair! The facial cleaning brush is awesome, I see a huge different in the amount of breakouts and blackheads. My only complain is the battery life, would be much better if it was chargeable instead of battery operated.</li>
    <li> I received this about a week ago, from Bzzagent to test out. I was so excited to try it out. I love the brush part for cleaning your face, but I had quite a time with the epilator. It caused a sting when I first started using it on my lip area I got used to the pain and tried it on my eyebrows. Not horrible, but my issue was it was a bit bulky and hard to tell exactly where I was taking hair off from when I tried doing my eyebrows. I ended up getting the skin around my brow bone caught in the area between the the epilator piece and the the actual tool.Luckily it did not cut my skin, it was just red and had a mark on it so note to self...be careful of getting the side area of the tool close to your skin. All in all it&#x27;s a decent product, I will continue to use it for facial cleaning, but I have went back to tweezing or waxing my eyebrows b/c I&#x27;m just a little leery of that part now.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the epilator function only. I have not used the facial brush and do not plan to because I already have a Clarisonic and am very happy with it.  As far as the epilator.... I normally get my eyebrows and upper lip threaded.  Recently I have started to notice some dark peach fuzz around my cheeks and &amp;#34;extended side burns&amp;#34;.  I wanted to remove this but didn&#x27;t want to shave my face.  After a significant amount of online research, it seemed like this Brand/Model was the best facial epilator on the market.  Before I used it, I showered and exfoliated as recommended.  I then proceeded to use the epilator on my upper lip going against the direction of the hair growth.  It seemed to work well.  It did hurt.  Especially right under my nose.  I would say that it was a little  more painful than threading. I than proceeded to use the epilator on my cheeks.  I will admit that this is not an area that the instructions say to the use the epilator on.  So this is my own fault.  I basically epilated my entire lower face.  It hurt, but was manageable.  Afterwards, I was slightly red but I expected this as I usually get a little red after hair removal.  The next morning my cheeks were covered in red bumps that have since turned into acne.  It has been a week and I am steal healing.  I am still giving the product 4 stars because I did not have a negative reaction on my upper lip and should have followed the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To others who are considering buying this for use on your cheeks/face, please be careful!</li>
    <li> Works really great. My only complain is the price.</li>
    <li> nice product fast sheeping</li>
    <li> I was so excited and had such high expectations that this would be a staple in my beauty routine but of course, it did not work. I was not satisfied with this product at all, as it did not remove the fine hairs on my face despite several attempts at utilizing it.</li>
    <li> I thought I would pick up one of these so that I didn&#x27;t have to keep paying for waxing of my brows and the darker, fine hair of my upper lip.  The pain of this device was several times more intense than waxing.  And when you are having to inflict the pain continuously on yourself, that&#x27;s just a no go.</li>
    <li> Loved this face epilator. I wanted to quit with the wax, now I can. This epilator gets the job done without any waxing.</li>
    <li> Works on thick and thin hairs, good size too:)</li>
    <li> got a defective piece</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product. I used it for the first time a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;The brush really gets my face much cleaner than face wash alone. Once I dry my face after using it, it feels so fresh and my skin so soft. I definitely recommend using the brush before the Epilator to get face as clean as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a combination of tweezing, trimming, waxing, and threading to remove unwanted face hair for years. I was very excited to try this product. As with any hair removal where the hair is pulled out by the root, there is some pain. It is comparable to tweezing, but instead of one pluck at a time, you have multiple. It is bearable though and definitely worth it because it cuts the overall time down SO much, and gets as much hair as waxing. I&#x27;ve stopped waxing due to inflammation afterwards, which would last a couple days and really hurt. So I was very pleased that I only had minor redness after using the Epilator. I used it right before bed and by the morning there was no irritation or redness at all. There is a slight learning curve as you figure out how to use the device, but I tried it out on my chin first and quickly picked it up. The chin only hurt a little, then the upper lip was more painful. Pulling the skin tightly did help, and the fact that I could see the results kept me going. The eyebrows were a little trickier, as I was scared to get too close to the actual brow. It wasn&#x27;t as painful as the lip though and I was able to get 90% of the hair I wanted to remove and then I finished with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I think after a few more uses, I will be better at using it, and there will be less hair therefore less pain, and I will be more desensitized to it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with this product and am pleased with the results. I will update my review after more uses.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as a promotion from Braun. The opinion expressed is completely mine and entirely honest.</li>
    <li> Got this from BzzAgent to try. Ive tried SOOOOOO many things to get rid of the hair on my chin-waxing, electrolysis, laser hair removal, tweezing. None of it worked well, except tweezing, but that is a pain!!!!&lt;br /&gt;At first try I thought Id never use this product again due to the ridiculous pain caused, but it really worked well. However the hair did grow back in less time than advertised by the product.&lt;br /&gt;On second try, I had a better handle on how to use the product and it was much less painful.&lt;br /&gt;The facial scrubber on the other hand was amazing and my skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> This epilator works by a tiny spinning head that grabs the hairs and pulls them out. I used to have my facial hair waxed professionally. Anyone who had that done knows it hurts. I purchased a wax machine to save myself money. I tried this machine and this was an annoying hurt. It pulled out each hair individually.  If you got too close to skin it would cut the skin. The cleansing brush did a great job in cleaning my face.</li>
    <li> I recently received this item from a campaign on BzzAgent. I was a bit nervous to use this at first as I was expecting it to be painful, but found if done properly it is not a problem at all. At first it stings slightly, like being hit with a rubber band. I found that the tighter I pulled my skin, the less painful it felt. What I like is that you can reverse the direction that it spins so that you can grab virtually any hair. I would recommend using this on a small are first in case of sensitive skin. When I used it on my upper lip, it left slightly red skin that cleared up within 5 minutes. I found that compared to waxing or tweezing, the Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 was much more gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman and have always had an embarrassing time with stubborn facial and chin hair. While I have used an epilator on my face before, I have never used an epilator that&#x27;s sole purpose was for one&#x27;s face. I have been using this for about a month and have found that the hairs are diminishing from my face. The Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 keeps the hairs off for a lot longer than tweezing or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial cleanser did a great job at exfoliating my face and making it feel very clean and smooth. The setup was very easy, all you do to switch to the cleansing brush or epilator is you simply pop off the top piece and exchange and pop the other piece on. Another reason why I loved it so much is because it&#x27;s shower safe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has truly been and will continue to be a part of my daily routine for skincare and it has changed my life! Thank you again BzzAgent for sending me the wonderful Braun Face Beauty Edition 810!!</li>
    <li> The facial epilator pulled skin on my face causing pain and red marks. Brush stopped rotating after about 2 months, so I tried new batteries, but it still didn&#x27;t work. To late for a refund.</li>
    <li> This is by far a superior product. At first i was apprehensive since i have sensitive skin. Man was i wrong. After i received my Braun product from Bzzagent i couldn&#x27;t wait to try it! I love the rotating brush. It is powerful enough to do the job, without causing any irritation. As for the epilator, it was good, but it did hurt a little. All in all i have and will recommend this item for purchase!</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Facial and cleansing Brush as a test trial. I have to say that the facial cleansing brush was wonderful. My face was clean and my skin felt refreshed and very soft. I truly enjoy it.I was however not pleased with the epilator, it just didn&#x27;t remove the hair well enough. The results weren&#x27;t as smooth as I would have liked. However, I was happy to have the opportunity to try this product and all- in- all I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Personally, I hate having facial hair and like to get my upper lip and eyebrows threaded. I&#x27;ve been wanting to get my cheeks and peach fuzz on my face threaded as well but the amount of pain has stopped me. So of course I was super excited to get this epilator in the mail and get rid of my facial hair in a painless way. It came with a battery and sadly it did not work. I tried playing with different batteries that I already had and none of them worked. After about 30 minutes I gave up and not even my dad was able to get it to work. I&#x27;m not sure if it was dysfunctional or what but i was really disappointed since it seems like such a good product!</li>
    <li> I did receive in a Bzzagent kit, so it was free, but that doesn’t change my feelings at all towards this tool. I’ve never heard of anything like this, and the box does claim that it is the first facial cleansing brush and epilator in one.  I do like how the box does show you the product on the back and details the way in which the product works. It states the the brush is meant for chin, upper lip, forehead, and maintaining eyebrows. I do like how on the packaging it states that it was dermatologist tested for sensitive skin, as I am one with sensitive skin. When I opened the box, I was surprised to see a brush just fall out and onto my lap. Even after reading the directions and looking at diagrams, I am not sure what that brush is for. I think it should’ve been packaged up with the rest of the product. The epilator and cleanser brush itself is very nice. It’s a good size and really sleek, making it comfortable to hold in the hand. It does take one AA battery on the bottom, but the battery closure shuts really tight. It also does have a power switch with two speed settings, making the brush really easy to use and figure out. The instructions that comes with the product are easy to follow as well. The box also contained a brush head, a replacement brush head, and a lid for the tool. I love that it comes with a lid; it makes it super convenient for travel.&lt;br /&gt; As for the epilator, I really love it. For those who haven’t used an epilator before, it is a painful process. The skin is being pulled out from the root, so it feels like a million tweezers plucking out hairs at the same time. This epilator is less painful, which might be because my lip and eyebrow areas are both used to being tweezed and waxed, but it was definitely a bearable pain. The slower speed setting really did not seem to get much hair out at all. I would go over areas a few times with no luck on several hairs. Once I went to the second speed setting though, that all changed. It was more painful, but all hair was being removed. I’m left with super soft skin that is also hairless. It was a really quick process. I loved it for my chin, upper lip, and in between my eyebrows. However, I would not recommend this product for maintaining eyebrow shape, as it is far too large. Overall, the epilator is an interesting concept and really nice product.&lt;br /&gt; Now, the facial cleanser brush I was not too big of a fan of. I own a clarisonic, and I would every time pick that over this. These bristles were a bit harsh, and really didn&#x27;t feel like they were cleaning my face at all. It just kind of moved soap around all over my face rather than actually cleansing. I do love that the heads are removable, but the only thing I would use the cleanser for is travel.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product is nice, I love the epilator and it&#x27;s an interesting concept. I would purchase it simply because of the epilator. If you already own a facial cleanser brush, there really is no need to purchase this product. Would not recommend to anyone wanting a facial cleanser brush - try clarisonic for that.</li>
    <li> I received this kit from BzzAgent and I am super impressed!! My favorite part of this product is the cleansing brush!  It is amazing!  So gentle I can even use it on my daughter. As a mother, I love the fact that something I use for a beauty product can double as something I can use on my kids.  It is great for a sticky face, because the motorized cleansing brush seems “fun” and they are willing to have their face cleaned.  Probably not a typical review for this product, but it is a nice side-use.  The cleansing brush is the perfect amount of power and gentleness.  It softly exfoliates the skin for a glowing face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator is a bit tricky to use.  It takes some practice to use it without lots of pinching!  At first I had to just put it down because I felt like it was pinching my skin in addition to pulling the hair out.  But after some practice, I was able to remove my hair as painlessly as possible.  It was able to grab the finest hairs and leave behind beautiful skin!</li>
    <li> I recently received this as part of a campaign for BzzAgent. I have never used any Braun products before but I have to say this is my new favorite device to use, it easily cut my tweezing time in half if not more. As previous reviews have said it does get the short hairs , it just takes a few passes over the area and make sure to pull your skin tight. You do have a little pain at first but it is bearable.(What tweezing does hurt?)  The size and the ability to change the direction of the rotation makes it easy to use on all the different areas of your face.  The cleansing brush works great, my skin feels smooth and soft after using it and so much cleaner than with just the face wash by itself. I would definitely recommend this to all my friends and family!</li>
    <li> Ok so i received this product free via Buzzagent which was great by the way. The epilator HURT like hell the first few times. Almost like when you tweeze or wax for the first time. It doesn&#x27;t hurt for long but does leave a little redness. It is really great at grabbing those short and or super fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s talk about the facial brush. I was a little disappointed. I found that I still had to use my facial soap and towel. I found that I still had residue from my makeup on my face.</li>
    <li> I received this product free from&lt;br /&gt;Braun in exchange for my review. Although I liked using this 2 in 1 product because of its effectiveness and ease, it sadly stopped working properly after a short time. I tried changing batteries, but it didn&#x27;t help. It lost it&#x27;s power. Prior to this loss of power I thought the epilator was effective. It wasn&#x27;t pain free but who really expects it to be. Was tolerable. Little to no breakouts after using. (Hair removal on my upper lip was always difficult Bc I usually hate the vibration of epilators or hate the feeling of wax on my lip and usually breakout regardless of what I use, this product did not cause much discomfort or breakouts). The facial cleanser was great, when it worked. Silver dollar-ish sized brush was not irritating. Felt like if cleaned without taking a layer of skin off!  I wish it came with a bag to keep the few parts together and I wish it worked longer. The overall idea of the 2 in 1 was great. What&#x27;s not great is the length of time it actually worked. Maybe I got a dud but I&#x27;d be upset if i paid for this product and it stopped working when it did.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool to have. I normally wouldn&#x27;t have bought it, but I got it free to try. I am so glad I did. I have a lot of baby hairs that are annoying on my face and sometimes waxing is just to cumbersome and messy. Now I can literally use this thing every day or when the need arises and I don&#x27;t have to plan, warm up wax, try not to spill wax on my face/counter/floor, then try not to remove the hair I do want to keep! The pain is minimal, just like with waxing, the tool is easy to use and easy to control. The battery life isn&#x27;t the best, but it just takes AA batteries which most everyone has in their household, and for the convince of this thing, it is definitely worth it! Plus I haven&#x27;t even mentioned the cleansing brush! Another great tool I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have spent the money on.... man I guess I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing. Just buy this thing, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!! I have been getting my chin and lip area threaded for years but recently a few more coarse hairs have shown up on my chin and more frequently than usual. Though threading is very neat and can probably be just a little more efficient (sometimes not, depending on person) weekly visits to the threading salon because tiresome and expensive. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this item but then I used it and I was completely impressed. It picks up coarser and longer hairs as well as tiny hairs so well and quickly. This hurts no more than threading (I didn&#x27;t take a painkillers before using) and does a great job. It did cause my upper lip area to be a little red but that was for under an hour. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Quick, efficient and private. In the long run, a real money saver....Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! While it won&#x27;t remove any course hairs without many attempts (so don&#x27;t try using it anywhere else on the body but the face), it is incredible for facial hair. Barely a pinch once you find the right direction and it gets even the finest of hairs. No more upper lip hair or hair between eyebrows and it took about 2 minutes. Just grab a witch hazel toner for use afterwards and it you&#x27;re already a waxer, you will have zero problems. I use fake tanner so no more white upper lip area or problems getting a natural tan where I&#x27;ve waxed. Makes me want to get a body epilator as soon as I can afford it! Good job Braun!</li>
    <li> This product is not even three months old, yet it is  broken already and does not work! It is not the battery.  It will not go on-I  am heartbroken</li>
    <li> I received this as a part of bzzagent campaign. Before I review it, I would like to say that I have a very sensitive skin. The kind that would lead to sun-burn like reaction following wax or threading, I was really eager to see if the epilator would provoke such a reaction. 2 hrs after, my skin was slightly irritated but as the day went by, the irritation subsided to my surprise .. I&#x27;m really happy that I found something efficient and at the same time skin-friendly. For fellow sensitive-skin people it is a really great product to consider... It is not irritation free option but it is wayyyy better than waxing or threading. And it does remove even the smallest hairs with minimal pain and discomfort.</li>
    <li> hi everybody I am a bzzagent and I got to try this out for free. And over all I was really happy with it. it was very easy to put together and take apart. The epilator was a bit painfull but I was very impressed with the end result and I am obsessed with the brush I have used it morning and  night and I love how its very soft  and it came with a second replacement brush so I will recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I received The Braun Face Beauty Edition 820 as part of a campaign promotion through Bzzagent and am so thrilled! #GotItFree  #Braun The packaging was very pleasing to the eye. Everything that you need to use the product is available inside the packaging! The epilator is very sleek and slim. The cleansing head and the epilator head are very easily changed without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many epilator&#x27;s and have to say this is the best yet. The slim and sleek design allow you to easily get into small areas. This epilator removes even the finest hairs from the root. It can be used on the chin, upper lip, forehead and to maintain your eyebrows. This is not a painless process, but is so much faster than trying to find those hairs and pull them out with tweezers! If this is your first time using one, just a warning this is painful but not unbearable. This Braun face epilator has left me hair-free and baby soft smooth! Very Impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing head&#x27;s are just as impressive as the epilator! It rotate&#x27;s, cleans and exfoliate your skin. Your face will feel wonderful after using them clean and baby smooth. I would suggest this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Due to the popularity of Clarisonics, and their premium price tag, there are a number of similar looking motorized facial brushes available. We even got a [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]] as well, found it a bit weak, but a decent bang for the buck. With the Braun name, we thought this would be a great alternative at slightly lower cost. It even has a hair remover to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the hair remover works with apolomb--though painful--the facial washing feature is just not up to snuff. The motor is powered by a single AA battery, which isn&#x27;t bad, until you try to wash your face with it. The power is simply inadequate. The speed of the brush is just not very fast or powerful. You can spend quite a few minutes, only to find that it didn&#x27;t do much at all. Even the brush is a bit irritating in the end, and caused some redness despite the lack of cleaning power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic looks and feels good, until you try to use it. The fit and finish is apparently not that great, because the brush head got stuck on the motor quite a few times, despite unlatching and even twisting a bit. I had to pull the brush off the head by the hair, which really shouldn&#x27;t be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve come to expect more from the Braun name. For the price it should probably be a bit better than this. I can&#x27;t recommend this to anyone because the primary function as a face washer is very weak at best, making this a fairly poor value.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a promotion from the brand. It&#x27;s lightweight and convenient to use. The epilator hurts a little when you use it, but I quickly got used to the feeling. It felt similar to other epilators that I have used.  The result was soft skin without bumps. I am looking forward to trying the facial cleaner. This product can also be used in the shower and it came with batteries. It&#x27;s my new toy!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this product.  However, when i tried to turn off the bottom with a coin (as the directions say) to put the battery in it scraped so much of the plastic off that i could not get it off!  Now the battery is stuck in the device and the plastic is so strayed that there is no way to get it out.  I wish they would have made the bottom a twist off so that it was easy to put the battery in.  I am therefore not able to even use the device due to the cheap plastic that it is made with.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Personally, I hate hair on my body except for my head.  I wish I had the money to remove all my body hair, because shaving and hair removal is such an uncomfortable and long process.  I have tried different methods to remove my facial hair and hate waxing, threading and plucking facial hair. especially my upper lip and chin.  I&#x27;ve have been dying to find something to remove my peach fuzz, but the amount of pain has stopped me. I recently received this epilator and naturally I was super excited try it.  So far it has been one week and the hair has not come back.  It was not as painful as some other brands of epilators I have tried in the past, but still stung a bit.  It is easy to use on the face and has a simple care and cleaning process.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Facial Epilator and Facial Cleansing Brush to try out through Bzzagent, and I was really excited to try it. Facial brushes seem all the rage lately, and I&#x27;ve personally tried a couple. This one is similar to the pricier brand, but unfortunately like any other facial brush, it was pretty harsh on my sensitive skin. It felt like sandpaper, even with plenty of soap, as I was using it; then my skin burned and was red for several hours after I finished. BUT my skin did look great after all that wore off, so it&#x27;s sort of a doubled edged sword. Beyond that, I like how you can change the direction of the brush spin, so I can change it when I move to the other side of my face. The batteries are going strong after a week of daily use, but it is ridiculously hard to get the battery compartment open, so hopefully they continue to be strong for a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator portion...I&#x27;m not going to lie...is terrifying. It hurts like crazy, which is understandable for hair removal, but the large head makes it difficult to know if you are tweezing the right area. You don&#x27;t want to waste that pain on the wrong spot. Also, because of the large head, it&#x27;s very easy to get your skin caught. I ended up scrapping the whole epilator idea and just stuck with the cleansing brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this brush to anyone who has large or clogged pores, as it does an excellent job of deep cleaning, but it&#x27;s probably too harsh for anyone with very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get to try this product for free from Braun and let me tell you the Braun Face Edition 820 is just what I hoping it would be! First, the facial cleaning brush is great. It rotates at a good speed, removes the makeup I wear without being harsh, and exfoliates my skin. You can use it while you&#x27;re taking a shower with or without cleanser and your skin looks radiant when you look in the mirror when you get out. My skin has greatly improved from just this product alone. I had some acne that would always appear on my chin area and it has cleared up since using the facial brush. I can really tell it is cleaning deep. Acne gone. Blackheads gone. Just fresh skin. Second, the epilator does what it&#x27;s supposed to do! I must admit, it&#x27;s a bit scary at first, but as you continue to use it you feel comfortable with it. I use it mostly on my upper lip, chin and above my eyebrows. It removes even the tiniest hairs and leaves it nice and smooth. This does leave some redness after, like most hair removal processes, but it only took a few hours  to go away. I used the epilator 3 weeks ago and I still don&#x27;t see any hair coming in. I love this product and am grateful I was able to try it out! I would buy this and give it as a present!</li>
    <li> i really love how this makes my skin feel and the epilator is a plus however after five months it got so hard to open the battery compartment and the end cracked and I can&#x27;t use it. :(</li>
    <li> facial epilator works great just the right size for narrow spaces around nose, ears &amp; mouth - small enough to capture thin hairs - the facial cleansing brush was just a bonus</li>
    <li> First off, I received this product free from Braun itself, and wow, what a gift it was! I was so excited to get this facial epilator/cleanser, that  once it finally arrived, I may have jumped the gun a little. I read through the directions quickly, and went straight to try the epilator. It was not super painful, but I was a little confused as to what direction I was supposed to use it in. It did take quite a while to get all the hair from my upper lip, but it sure did get every single tiny strand just like it said it would!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty excited, but then the next morning, I woke up to a bunch of tiny red bumps - which did not go away for quite a few days! I was mortified, but so glad that I could avoid going out during that time. As I was about to swear off this product forever, I decided to at least give the cleaner side a try, and am so glad that I did. It left my skin so soft and radiant, and I appreciated the truly clean feeling it gave me!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m chalking the irritation up to sensitive skin, and have since been able to use the product without much redness appearing afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend at least giving this product a try. It definitely does what it says as far as epilating and cleaning, but I would say to test out the product with ample time to see any reactions BEFORE you need to go to a big event! 4/5 stars for a bit of a steep learning curve and because 4 weeks hair-free was far from the results that I got.</li>
    <li> This was a pretty decent kit, I will continue to use it. I did receive this for free as part of a Bzzkit promotion. It came with an epilator, a facial brush attachment, an extra facial brush a cap, and a small cleaning brush for the epilator. The cleaning brush kind of just fell out so be careful about that.    The epilator is just alright, it doesn&#x27;t get all hairs but it does get most of them. Unfortunately it can break a lot of hairs rather than pulling them out, kind of just trimming. I still use it because these things are only noticeable up close, but this is my main qualm with this kit. Otherwise it&#x27;s very quick and easy, way faster than tweezing.    The cleaning brush is very soft and feels great, though I tend not to use it often because I personally worry about over exfoliating. I haven&#x27;t tried any other facial brushes but this brush is nice and gentle and leaves my face feeling rather fresh afterwards.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free from Braun and certainly would not have purchased it on my own. Prior to this I have tried EVERYTHING to remove the hairs on my chiny chin chin to no avail. As I have aged they have come in more coarse and thicker (soooo annoying). Neither electrolysis nor laser hair removal made a significant dent in the issue. So I had resolved to tweezing which is time consuming and painful.&lt;br /&gt;Being that I was hesitant and not convinced it would work on my thick coarse hairs, I started out just using the facial cleansing brush. At first it made my skin hurt a little, but after a few days use that subsided. Within a week I noticed my skin was much healthier looking and my pores were smaller!&lt;br /&gt;Definite win on the facial scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;After day 1 of scrubbing I ventured into use of the epilator. My first thoughts, \\&quot;OUCH and NEVER using it again!\\&quot; By the next morning, I had decided I should probably give it another fair shot as I probably wasn&#x27;t using it 100% correctly at first. After my second use I felt it was definitely worth it, I now feel more confident and less self conscious about my facial hairs. About a week ago I used it for a third time as I noticed hairs were growing back. Overall, I like it alot and its MUCH less time consuming than plucking with a tweezer. However, its not easy to master getting the epilator spinning the correct way to pluck the thick hairs. I definitely will continue to use it and recommend it to others despite the pain factor.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Braun products having owned a few of their electronic items, however this particular product in my honest opinion is overpriced to say the least. While it does a decent job of removing hair, it is definitely not worth the $70+ price it is being sold as by Braun - I would not pay more than $25 for this. Like one of the other users mentioned, it feels like a cheap piece of plastic which is battery operated. The facial cleansing brush ability is a joke.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Face 810 as part of a campaign for BzzAgent. First off you will need a coin to open and insert the battery and make sure its lined up properly before tightening it down. First I gave the epilator a try. first on my arm to see if it worked and the pain level, I wax  and also have had laser hair removal so i figured it couldn&#x27;t be that bad, well on sensitive areas it is a little painful but it works quickly grabbing and pulling out even the most fine little hairs! I should also mention you can reverse the the way it turns so you can grab hair in any direction!&lt;br /&gt;Next on to the face brush, I currently use one and love it but i am skeptical about some facial brushes because they can be a little to harsh but this one was pretty soft, made my facial cleanser lather nicely and left my face feeling clean and exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great little product, it&#x27;s compact, runs off of a small battery and is super easy to use!</li>
    <li> Product died within 1 month of use.</li>
    <li> I got this for free from Braun through The Bzz Agent. Cleans my face very well. I&#x27;ve only used facial scrubs before. When doing the hair removal, it does hurt a bit.... Not more than normal waxing, threading, or tweezing does though.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for a much better product from a well acclaimed brand.&lt;br /&gt;It stopped working within a month.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to have amazon refund it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didnt notice before that all recent reviews are &#x27;kind of paid&#x27; reviews. They got free products to test and write the reviews.</li>
    <li> I am not sure about this product, seems  to tweeze (because now I use tweezers, razor, and shaver for eye brows, chin, mustache, etc).  Facial brush have not used so genttle I can&#x27;t  see how it could clean.</li>
    <li> :( I just got it and it doesn&#x27;t work.i have tried different batteries but nothing&#x27;s changed.i don&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
    <li> Works great - really love it!</li>
    <li> It stings a lot but does a good job removing hair.  The small size gives you good control.  I really love the facial cleansing brush, and a big plus is that you can use it in the tub.  I think it does a better job than facial cleansers with scrubbing grains, and I like it better than the Buff-Puff.  The unit doesn&#x27;t take up much room in your makeup case when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to drain the battery quickly, so I would recommend having at least a 4-pack of batteries on hand.</li>
    <li> Great for removing any facial hair.  It will take work and is best if you work in one small section at a time.  I have very sensitive, fair skin and I definitely recommend only using this at night before bed because there will be redness and irritation.  By morning, the redness is gone for me.  Depending on how long you use it in a sitting, it will eat batteries quickly.  I do around my eyebrows and jawline and I can use this twice before needing a new battery.  I&#x27;d buy this again in a heartbeat.  It makes hair removal so much easier!</li>
    <li> This product works well for facial hair. At this price it should be rechargeable. You have to replace the battery each time you use it.</li>
    <li> As a woman who has more facial hair than I’d like to admit, I have used about every product on the market to get it under control. I was really excited to test out this product as part of a promotion through BzzAgent. When they say “Beauty is pain”, they’re not kidding! If you’ve used an epilator before, you know what I’m talking about. While I’ve only used an epilator on my legs a couple times before, the face is a much more sensitive area. It did provide good results, but I doubt I’ll use it for that because of the pain. I must be a wimp when it comes to pain because I don’t know if I could use it often enough to get used to it. It might be better on a person who has finer facial hair (peach fuzz). However, the facial cleansing brush attachment is amazing. I could really notice the difference in my skin shortly after using. I had a new glow and softness. I will be using that attachment for sure!</li>
    <li> I got this product as part of a bzz agent campaign.  The pros: The cleansing brush works good and feels as if it&#x27;s really cleaning my face well.  The cons: The epilator does hurt and I think the actual brish on the cleanser can be larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I do think this is a good product and it&#x27;s nice to have two uses in one item.  Saves space and is efficient.</li>
    <li> First of all this item is from Braun which is a well known company and they make quality products. I was very excited to receive this as part of a promotion through the company. I used it 2-3 times at first when I received it, but then I realized how amazing it is and use it everyday now. Ha ha ha. It&#x27;s so simple to use, turn it on and tweeze your facial hair away! Then you can twist the top off and add the facial cleanser to wash your face with. So simple. It&#x27;s battery operated and it comes with a battery in the package. Slim and light. I didn&#x27;t think it would be something I would use a lot, but now I realize what I was missing and should have got this a long time ago. saves you time and money to get rid of facial hair and keep your skin smooth.</li>
    <li> When I got it I gave it 5 stars because I was so satisfied but after 1.5 month it broke. it just stopped. I thought may be because of battery, and changed it but nothing. I didn&#x27;t do anything. Just used epilator 3 times a week. Thats it. Now, I need to find out to somewhere to fix it.  Edit: I sent it to braun service. I waited 3 weeks, just got it back and it still doesn&#x27;t work. I can&#x27;t believe that. I just could used it 2 months.</li>
    <li> This works great!  Bought it strictly for my face and gets eery hair that is there.  I had been hot waxing for years or plucking and that hurts much more than this.  It is easy to get used to!  Had a problem getting off the cap to put the battery in, but finally got it.  I would purchase this again without hesitation.  It hurts no worse than waxing or plucking.  Left my face very smooth.  After using I thought it was running quite slow.  Replaced the battery with a fresh new on and increased power greatly!..   REPLACE BATTERY FOR FRESH ONE!</li>
    <li> Braun usually makes great products.  This is not one of them.</li>
