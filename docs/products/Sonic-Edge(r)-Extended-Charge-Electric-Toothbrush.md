      <li>Just perfect !!  </li>
      <li>Best toothbrush ever.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon has a wonderful return policy--thank you!</li>
      <li>Very happy with this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>but it is great.  </li>
      <li>But was a great electric toothbrush for that time.</li>
      <li>I have had every brand and this one is great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this is a great sonic toothbrush - great value - and it holds a charge forever - this is now</li>
      <li>it is a good product.</li>
      <li>Best toothbrush, I love it, and price is lovely, I will recommend for my family and friends.</li>
      <li>Fabulous - buy buy buy!!  </li>
      <li>Toothbrush is now demonically turning itself off and on all day, won&#x27;t turn on when button is pressed and the cheap button area just fell off!!</li>
      <li>The charge holds up nicely.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and very happy with item.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice &amp;#34;pulse&amp;#34; mode that is just for the gums.  </li>
      <li>If it comes anywhere near the Cybersonic, I will be very happy --</li>
      <li>Love it - battery will never run out ..</li>
      <li>have been a Sonicare user since 1994 and totally love them.</li>
      <li>This is a surprisingly innovative Sonic challenger to the Braun Sonic brushes.</li>
      <li>And for the price I don&#x27;t believe there is a better electric toothbrush out there.</li>
      <li>My wife said she liked it, but I don&#x27;t feel comfortable ordering another one.  </li>
      <li>love the setting love the price  </li>
      <li>I Am very pleasantly surprised how great it makes my mouth feel.</li>
      <li>my travel sonic toothbrush -&lt;br /&gt;it can easily go for 2 weeks on a charge</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a great selling point for people who travel and don&#x27;t want to take a charger along with them on short trips.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>this doesnt have the fit and finsih of a sonicare -</li>
      <li>Well worth the money and a noticeable difference in how clean my teeth feel!</li>
      <li>Works great and as expected.</li>
      <li>We have had this toothbrush for only a couple of weeks, but so far it is as good an electric toothbrush as we have ever tried, and we have tried the top brands.  </li>
      <li>It is polished, sturdy while very light in weight, gives you a timer of 30 seconds for each of your four tooth surfaces and shuts off completely after the programmed two minutes of brushing.</li>
      <li>I liked it a lot while it was working, but that was short lived.</li>
      <li>but it was worth it.</li>
      <li>I prefer my old sonic better.</li>
      <li>This time around I just bought this version of the electronic toothbrush and man, this hits all the marks right on the head.  </li>
      <li>It has made getting her expanders and braces much easier to clean.</li>
      <li>Too strong vibration, gave me sensitive tooth and gums.</li>
      <li>My gums are already sensitive and bleed pretty easily, so I was brushing too cautiously.</li>
      <li>So far this is a great alternative to the other brushes on the market in terms of price and functionality.  </li>
      <li>This toothbrush is exactly what I need.</li>
      <li>I started years ago when the first electronic toothbrushes came out....</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ll try it one more time and save having a different charger in the bathroom.</li>
      <li>The soft setting brushes firmly enough to give me a satisfied, clean feeling afterwards</li>
      <li>As my dentist said, brushing and stimulating the gums is as important as brushing the teeth as it prevents the gum from pulling away from the teeth, evidently a major contributing cause of gingivitis.  </li>
      <li>the price is much cheaper than Sonicare and the vibration (the very minute movement that actually cleans the teeth) is very strong and can even be stepped down in three strength mode, nice for people whose gums are sensitive.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Very noisy too.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>The result is that the toothbrush unit just sits on the charger unit very precariously -- the slightest disturbance and the brush unit will topple off the charger.  </li>
      <li>It is very noisy.  </li>
      <li>I was very hesitant to try this brand but needed to get my daughter another toothbrush because of orthodontics.</li>
      <li>My only concern is that it may earn higher prices, but even then it would be worth it.</li>
      <li>Action and power strength of toothbrush was far too powerful.</li>
      <li>It has a family collection of various brushes and is light and compact enough to take on trips.</li>
      <li>so it prompts you to spend the same amount of time on each quadrant of the mouth -- seems we naturally tent to spend more time on our dominant hand side that the other side of the mouth when brushing.  </li>
      <li>the only thing it did was act like a timer, The  Sonic Edge is more than that this thing rips it took me a little while to get use to it</li>
      <li>Brush works great, but the brush and heads do not sit securely on the base and are constantly falling off.</li>
      <li>and I frequently turn it off while brushing accidently.  </li>
      <li>So far have charged once.</li>
      <li>I had a old cheap electric that was not much better than a normal brush</li>
      <li>It encourages you not to apply any force to your teeth, letting the brushing action to all the work.</li>
      <li>so it is simple and very inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>The item is nice-takes up a little more counter space than expected.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised that not only did it equal the Braun, but surpassed it.</li>

<li> I was pleasantly surprised that not only did it equal the Braun, but surpassed it.</li>
<li> I have not yet taken it on vacation to see how long the charge will last outside the charger.  </li>
<li> In fact, when you set it on the charger, it&#x27;s really a balancing act; it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything is actually holding it there securely, certainly not that little nipple.  </li>
<li> Now I wait to see how long it will last.</li>
<li> I had to return that toothbrush because even on low switch, you had to keep your mouth closed because of spashing around!</li>
<li> My Braun Sonic ran down, and I never heard of this Acteh brand, but was attracted to its low price</li>
<li> This toothbrush went completely dead only one month after purchase.</li>
<li> i have been a lifelong sonicare users - still am -  </li>
<li> It is a cheaper imitation; I should have known.</li>
<li> I started with Sonocare and found it had a very weak vibration and even putting too much toothpaste on the bush</li>
<li> I recently had a gum graft surgery because my gum recession was pretty bad.</li>
<li> Problem is, that nipple is too short and to small for the corresponding hole in the base to fit into it snugly.  </li>
<li> but then it is basically half the price - and the replacement brushes are a fraction of the price of the sonicare ones</li>
<li> I mistakenly thought it would be a Sonic brand which is what I previously had....</li>
<li> This timer (gives three slight pauses in the brush cycle to tell you to switch sides of the mouth).  </li>
<li> On the battery life...Holy Cow!  </li>
<li> so I wasted my money.</li>
<li> and it was a huge improvement over Sonicare, especially over the very VERY expensive Philips Sonicare brush heads which are very complicated and contain parts.  </li>
<li> Last weekend it vibrated randomly every 5-10 minutes and there was nothing I could do to shut it off.</li>
<li> That nipple protrusion really doesn&#x27;t hold the brush body firmly to the base.</li>
<li> press it too hard on your teeth</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s to late to return it.  </li>
<li> No more gum bleeding!</li>
<li> Oh...the one con -- the charger base -- the base itself has a very small nipple protruding from the top surface; it&#x27;s about a quarter of an inch in height and the base of the toothbrush has a small receptacle hole in it&#x27;s bottom that the nipple fits into.  </li>
<li> I hate spending another $62 for something that lasted less than 2 months.</li>
<li> I am even contemplating applying little strips of velcro to the charger base and to the bottom of the toothbrush unit.  </li>
<li> The power button is in a uncomfortable place</li>
<li> I was not impressed.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, the brush wobbles on the stand and often falls off</li>
<li> and it would have a difficult time of it...</li>
<li> and it is broken!!</li>
<li> The heads are very difficult to take on or off.</li>
<li> I thought this was a Sonic Care product and was disappointed it was not.  </li>
<li> so you could take it on vacation and not need to take the clunky charger base.  </li>
<li> Terrible.</li>

    <li> it is a good product. It does hold a charge. Use to have battery&#x27;s before used lots. Not alot of speed. Cheep made. some times didnt last a month quite working.  So far have charged once. Not had 6 weeks yet. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush, I love it, and price is lovely, I will recommend for my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Brush works great, but the brush and heads do not sit securely on the base and are constantly falling off.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Cheap. Not like a sonicare .there is no power to this toothbrush  .not a fan</li>
    <li> The item is nice-takes up a little more counter space than expected.</li>
    <li> This is a surprisingly innovative Sonic challenger to the Braun Sonic brushes. My Braun Sonic ran down, and I never heard of this Acteh brand, but was attracted to its low price, so low that if it didn&#x27;t equal the performance of the Braun, I would trade off any inferiority, given the low price. I was pleasantly surprised that not only did it equal the Braun, but surpassed it. It is polished, sturdy while very light in weight, gives you a timer of 30 seconds for each of your four tooth surfaces and shuts off completely after the programmed two minutes of brushing. It encourages you not to apply any force to your teeth, letting the brushing action to all the work. It has a family collection of various brushes and is light and compact enough to take on trips. My only concern is that it may earn higher prices, but even then it would be worth it.</li>
    <li> Tooth brush was delivered and it works as advertised.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
    <li> This product decided to stop charging after only 5 months of use! But was a great electric toothbrush for that time.</li>
    <li> Fabulous - buy buy buy!!  Love it - battery will never run out .. its a miracle! )  No more gum bleeding!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush went completely dead only one month after purchase. Last weekend it vibrated randomly every 5-10 minutes and there was nothing I could do to shut it off. Now it won&#x27;t even turn on. I liked it a lot while it was working, but that was short lived.</li>
    <li> Is have had this toothbrush for 6 weeks and it is broken!! They have a 30 day return window and I am over that so I wasted my money. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is exactly what I need. I recently had a gum graft surgery because my gum recession was pretty bad. My gums are already sensitive and bleed pretty easily, so I was brushing too cautiously. This took care of everything for me. The soft setting brushes firmly enough to give me a satisfied, clean feeling afterwards and I haven&#x27;t bled once since using it. The charge holds up nicely. I&#x27;ve been using it a week without charging it (my husband, too), and the charge has held up.  *Heads up: my toothbrush DID NOT come with 4 heads. It only came with 2.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and very happy with item.</li>
    <li> Just perfect !!  Eactly what I wanted!!</li>
    <li> Returned. Action and power strength of toothbrush was far too powerful. Painful.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has a wonderful return policy--thank you!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the brush wobbles on the stand and often falls off</li>
    <li> Works great and as expected. Now I wait to see how long it will last.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this toothbrush. I had a old cheap electric that was not much better than a normal brush the only thing it did was act like a timer, The  Sonic Edge is more than that this thing rips it took me a little while to get use to it but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I had to return that toothbrush because even on low switch, you had to keep your mouth closed because of spashing around! Too strong vibration, gave me sensitive tooth and gums. Very noisy too.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars except for the size of the tooth brush head.  I switched from the Philips brand and these brushes are slightly larger causing a chatter on my teeth...but I got used to using this item.  On the battery life...Holy Cow!  I brush 3 times a day and this unit was only charged once in 5 weeks.  That&#x27;s a great selling point for people who travel and don&#x27;t want to take a charger along with them on short trips.&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/4/2015&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for my wife in October.  It stopped running and it&#x27;s to late to return it.  My wife said she liked it, but I don&#x27;t feel comfortable ordering another one.  Since I already have one and it&#x27;s running, I&#x27;ll try it one more time and save having a different charger in the bathroom. I hate spending another $62 for something that lasted less than 2 months.</li>
    <li> if it comes out of you mouth tooth paste goes everywhere.</li>
    <li> ****** updated, after about 6 months of use *******&lt;br /&gt;Piece of junk. Toothbrush is now demonically turning itself off and on all day, won&#x27;t turn on when button is pressed and the cheap button area just fell off!! Never ever had a cheaper, piece of junk. So totally disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Sonicare user since 1994 and totally love them. I was very hesitant to try this brand but needed to get my daughter another toothbrush because of orthodontics. For the price I figured I would give it a try. I Am very pleasantly surprised how great it makes my mouth feel. It has made getting her expanders and braces much easier to clean.</li>
    <li> We have had this toothbrush for only a couple of weeks, but so far it is as good an electric toothbrush as we have ever tried, and we have tried the top brands.  And for the price I don&#x27;t believe there is a better electric toothbrush out there.</li>
    <li> i have been a lifelong sonicare users - still am -  this doesnt have the fit and finsih of a sonicare - but then it is basically half the price - and the replacement brushes are a fraction of the price of the sonicare ones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a great sonic toothbrush - great value - and it holds a charge forever - this is now my travel sonic toothbrush -&lt;br /&gt;it can easily go for 2 weeks on a charge</li>
    <li> I started years ago when the first electronic toothbrushes came out....was the &amp;#34;first on my block to get have one&amp;#34;  so to speak.  I started with Sonocare and found it had a very weak vibration and even putting too much toothpaste on the bush and it would have a difficult time of it...press it too hard on your teeth and it would even stop.  I was not impressed.  Then I bought a Cybersonic and it was a huge improvement over Sonicare, especially over the very VERY expensive Philips Sonicare brush heads which are very complicated and contain parts.  The Cybersonic and this unit have all the mechanism in the handle and the only thing the head is, is an extension with a brush on the end; it has no mechanical parts so it is simple and very inexpensive.  This time around I just bought this version of the electronic toothbrush and man, this hits all the marks right on the head.  I reiterate what has been said before -- the price is much cheaper than Sonicare and the vibration (the very minute movement that actually cleans the teeth) is very strong and can even be stepped down in three strength mode, nice for people whose gums are sensitive.  It has the same timer function that Sonicare has which divides the brush cycle time in quarters so it prompts you to spend the same amount of time on each quadrant of the mouth -- seems we naturally tent to spend more time on our dominant hand side that the other side of the mouth when brushing.  This timer (gives three slight pauses in the brush cycle to tell you to switch sides of the mouth).  It also has a nice &amp;#34;pulse&amp;#34; mode that is just for the gums.  As my dentist said, brushing and stimulating the gums is as important as brushing the teeth as it prevents the gum from pulling away from the teeth, evidently a major contributing cause of gingivitis.  So far this is a great alternative to the other brushes on the market in terms of price and functionality.  I have not yet taken it on vacation to see how long the charge will last outside the charger.  If it comes anywhere near the Cybersonic, I will be very happy -- that brush had a charge that lasted over 10 days outside the charger so you could take it on vacation and not need to take the clunky charger base.  This one seems to be touting extended battery life so I am hoping!  Oh...the one con -- the charger base -- the base itself has a very small nipple protruding from the top surface; it&#x27;s about a quarter of an inch in height and the base of the toothbrush has a small receptacle hole in it&#x27;s bottom that the nipple fits into.  Problem is, that nipple is too short and to small for the corresponding hole in the base to fit into it snugly.  The result is that the toothbrush unit just sits on the charger unit very precariously -- the slightest disturbance and the brush unit will topple off the charger.  That nipple protrusion really doesn&#x27;t hold the brush body firmly to the base. In fact, when you set it on the charger, it&#x27;s really a balancing act; it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything is actually holding it there securely, certainly not that little nipple.  I am even contemplating applying little strips of velcro to the charger base and to the bottom of the toothbrush unit.  Last thing I want is for the brush to accidentally get bumped and it fall to the floor or even into the sink and get damaged.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has problems with plaque build-up.</li>
    <li> Brush repeatly broke at hub making use&lt;br /&gt;Impossible. No response to email&lt;br /&gt;Report of the problem. Skip this item.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush suddenly stopped working and is now unresponsive even when charged.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a Sonic Care product and was disappointed it was not.  The power button is in a uncomfortable place and I frequently turn it off while brushing accidently.  It is very noisy.  It is a cheaper imitation; I should have known.</li>
    <li> love the setting love the price  thanks</li>
    <li> The heads are very difficult to take on or off. Next time I would just bite the bullet for name brand. &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; is not &amp;#34;Phillips Sonic&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I mistakenly thought it would be a Sonic brand which is what I previously had....but it is great.  I would never have known the difference.</li>
    <li> Sonic did not meet my dental needs .Returned merchandise and requested  $ 60.00 refurnd .Thanks</li>
    <li> I prefer my old sonic better. I dislike it stops periodically indicating it is time to move on. I rather it beep than stop.  The heads are different so now I&#x27;m buying two different heads and using two different chargers</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever. I have had every brand and this one is great.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money and a noticeable difference in how clean my teeth feel!</li>
