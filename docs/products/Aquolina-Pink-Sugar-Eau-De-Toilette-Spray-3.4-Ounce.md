<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ADORE this fragrance and always get compliments.</li>
    <li> Do you like sugary smells? Do you prefer vanillas over florals? Do you enjoy smelling like a warm delicious pastry? Then hands down you should love this perfume. Now that I&#x27;ve finally discovered it, I feel like I have joined this secret club of women I&#x27;ve envied for years who always smell so notably sweet instead of the nauseating musk I smell in so many others perfumes. Finally, I smell like a walking sugar cube too - and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> It is stronger than what I would like, but overall I do like it. Just have to be careful how many times I spray it haha.</li>
    <li> I should have known if it sounds to good to be true then it generally is. I just trust Amazon to sell good products and since this was from Amazon LLC I believed it would be good quality Pink Sugar. It is the furthest from that. The smell is terrible and nothing like Pink Sugar. I compared the coloring with a bottle I purchased from Ulta and sure enough the Ulta bottle was light colored- nearly clear liquid, while the bottle from Amazon is discolored yellowish orange. I will not purchase Pink Sugar from Amazon again and am disappointed that I trusted I would receive the real product to begin with. This is definitely fake, or very, very old. Of course when i tried to return it a message came up that this product could not be returned because its a hazardous fluid. Nice waste of $25. I guess I will stick to my kindle books as the only purchases I can trust from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really wear perfume but this one has a pleasant scent that is not overwhelming. I has a hint of musk that underscores its sweet overtone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this purfume for years and when I found it on amazon I thought this was a great deal compared to what I usually purchase it at from Nordstroms.  The color was off in the photo but I thought it was just a bad photo of the purfume.  I received it in the mail, it actually was yellow and smelt horrible so I called and they said to go ahead and toss it and they would send out a new one at no charge, so they did, which was awesome but it was the same exact thing!  So I called back and they put in a report and I told them this product isnt the correct purfume, not only is the color off but its smells horrible.  So they asked me to put a comment on here so others who order can purchase this from another supplier on amazon and don&#x27;t have to go through this also.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps others out there that LOVE this brand and scent.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SCENT... SMELLS LIKE COTTON CANDY..</li>
    <li> Product was old. The perfume was a strange yellow color. The perfume smells great when it is not old.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume since I was in fifth grade and I am currently graduating high school. This sent has gotten me attention while walking in the streets and at school it&#x27;s incredible I love it so much!</li>
    <li> I love the purfume... to bad I never received it!</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells wonderful to wear anytime of the day..</li>
    <li> TOO SWEE SMELLING FOR ME BUT AS IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY THRILLED</li>
    <li> Came quick, looks perfect. My girl is gonna love it</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this purchase.  My husband said it smelled like gasoline!&lt;br /&gt;Threw it out.  I had purchased 2 large bottles - what a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;Knock offs should be labelled as such.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Received the delivery earlier than expected and Iwas very happy because it was a birthday gift of ordered last minute.  It also smells like yummy smelling baked goods :)</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good. At Sefora it&#x27;s $60 and its only $21 on Amazon. Amazing deal and perfume smells soooo good, I would repurchase</li>
    <li> product was as discribed, no flaw, fast shipping, I would recommand ay time fas a gift or for own use....for women of course</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother for Christmas. never heard of it before so she gave me a few recommendations and this was one of them.&lt;br /&gt;It smells very nice I was impressed and very good value.</li>
    <li> Its a very sweet and strong fragrance , you love it or you don&#x27;t kind of scent ... I love it , the cotton candy dries down to yummy creamy cupcake vanilla ... and the price was a steal ,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Pink sugar for over 7 years now and it is still my favorite perfume ever! It is a really sweet smell if you don&#x27;t like sweet smells but its not a nauseating fruity type of sweet its a really soft sweet smell. People tell me every day how good i smell (espeshally boys) and i enjoy having the smell around all day also. Its amazing you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Amazon does not allow you to return. Watch out!!! This does not last long. Guess because it is Eau De Toilette</li>
    <li> Pink sugar is my favorite perfume and the real pink sugar smells way stronger than this one that I just purchased. I was able to tell that it wasn&#x27;t the right perfume the second I got it because the color was yellow. It is definitely watered down or something. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Omg I love this spray!!! I get compliments all the time and it&#x27;s resonably priced... A little goes along way!!!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! I definitely recommend it to someone wanting a sweet perfume.</li>
    <li> I love my Pink Sugar!</li>
    <li> got this for my daughter. It is a very light, innocent fragrance. She loves it. It isn&#x27;t overpowering. Very sweet, vanilla-y scent.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  It&#x27;s not flowery or clean, it&#x27;s a sweet scent and only a couple of sprays lasts all day.  Nice container and not a horrible price either.  Win/win!!!</li>
    <li> I was nervous to buy this perfume online considering there were so many mixed reviews. I already had a bottle and had saved the packaging and everything, so I could compare the store bought (Nordstrom&#x27;s) and the Amazon bought perfume side by side. Neither package from Nordstroms or Amazon has a pepper on it, so don&#x27;t let that deter buying this perfume. (Amazon really should choose a different picture, one that does not have a pepper on it, so it is less confusing). Also the perfume is not clear like white vinegar, it has a very faint yellowish color to it, which is normal. Heck the Burberry I wear is a yellow tint that is darker than this bottle. I really like this perfume and it smells fresh and nice. My husband loves when i wear this smell, and I have been getting compliments on the fragrance from random strangers.</li>
    <li> Definitely fake. Reeks of alcohol, although the bottle is quite convincing.</li>
    <li> This is one of the greatest fragrances that I have ever purchased! Everytime I wear it I always receive compliments! It is long lasting and reasonably priced. Definitely worth the $$!</li>
    <li> Women and men alike are always saying, &amp;#34;MMMmmmm&amp;#34; around me. It smells of cotton candy and love. Its light, sweet and goes over well with most.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume, ever! I will never purchase any other kind of perfume. It lasts a long time and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love scents that smell like cotton candy, but this definitely isn&#x27;t one of them. It has that fake &amp;#34;orange-y&amp;#34; scent that just smells nauseating. I wanted to like it, but I wasn&#x27;t able to stomach it. I ended up giving it to my daughter, and she ended up giving it away, as well. It might be fine for some people, but I&#x27;m not one of them.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this perfume.</li>
    <li> This smells just like cotton candy or so my friends say when I wear this scent. It is light,fun and lasts a long time.  Great year round fragrance.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I believe a majority of these I have received are fake, and not the actual Pink Sugar by Aquonlina.  I say this because the pink strips on the bottle often rub off quickly and Aquolina is nowhere written on any of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;That being said I believe this is exactly like the real thing at a much better cost.  I have been wearing this for over a year and I love it.  It&#x27;s a wonderful fun scent and I have actually compared it to the real Pink Sugar from Sephora and could not find any differences whatsoever.  Normally I wouldn&#x27;t promote buying fake products but this holds up on its own and at half the cost.</li>
    <li> Been buying this perfume for years -love it to death. was purchasing it from Sephora. But got tired of the price. Found it at Amazon for the same size at a extremely  lower price. now I shop at Sephora then go to amazon to purchase.</li>
    <li> Must be an old or not properly stored product. It is discolored and doesn&#x27;t smell the way it usually does.</li>
    <li> smells so good! My staple scent.</li>
    <li> I had originally received a sample size of this perfume and absolutely loved it. So I decided to purchase it from Amazon since it was listed at a decent price. However the spray nozzle seems to be very cheaply made or not sized correctly. I have found that anytime I spray it that I end up with perfume running down my fingers as well as the sides of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance!  Not too strong, not too weak!</li>
    <li> I like the smell but my wife hates it..</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume I had previously been purchasing from Walgreens.  Amazon&#x27;s price and shipping are the best!  Perfume smells like cotton candy, vanilla, cookies, etc., but doesn&#x27;t smell like a kid&#x27;s scent.  I get compliments every time I wear it.  It lasts throughout the day too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. I&#x27;ve been wearing it about 10 years and I always receive compliments on the scent. It smells light cotton candy. Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume</li>
    <li> Candy and cupcakes! Love the sweet smell of this. The syrupy sweet smell dies down to a nice soft candy smell.</li>
    <li> It is a sweet-scented perfume.  The scent lasts all day, but it is not overwhelming.  I get a lot of compliments when I use Pink Sugar.</li>
    <li> I always receive compliments and it&#x27;s light enough not to bother those who are sensitive to fragrance.  Smells good enough to eat.</li>
    <li> love it!!! delivery was with-in 1 day...was shocked it came so fast...Love the product!!!! Great price!!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how amazing this smell is! Like pink cotton candy. I fell in love with this at Sephora but really couldn&#x27;t see paying $30 for 1oz when I found this! I got mine nearly a year ago and have less than 1/2 the bottle left. I try to wear it more on special occasions or when I&#x27;m going out because it just seems to sweet to wear everyday. It still is one of my favorite perfumes however and the next thing I get will be the lotion or shower gel.</li>
    <li> This is my new signature scent. I&#x27;m always being told that I smell &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;what are you wearing? That smells so good!&amp;#34; I&#x27;m reluctant to give this such a good rating because I like the attention and I&#x27;m kind of selfish that way...but I don&#x27;t want them to discontinue this scent. I absolutely love it and will order many more bottles in the future.</li>
    <li> I just love this scent.  My nephew always notices when I wear it.  We laugh and say the name of the product: &amp;#34;PINK SUGAR!&amp;#34; That&#x27;s just what it smells like. It is a fun and inviting fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to get a great deal for my favorite perfume. I ordered two bottles. The bottle arrived on time. The only issue is, the perfume is a fake. The perfume smells faintly like Pink Sugar mixed with alcohol. Never again. I will stick with Ulta.</li>
    <li> This one was a Christmas gift for my sister- She and her boyfriend love this one!  This one is always a hit!</li>
    <li> After spending nearly the same amount on a rollerball of this fragrance at a department store, I was excited to see a LARGE bottle (3.4 oz) for this price. Amazing! The product I received was perfect, no discoloration. It&#x27;s smells exactly like the one I bought in the store. The shipping was fast, too- even free. Great job, Amazon. This transaction is exactly why I choose Amazon when I&#x27;m looking for a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is sweet, just like candy. But, it doesn&#x27;t smell juvenile to me. This is my new summer scent. I just wish it lasted longer. I feel like I have to reapply many times a day.</li>
    <li> Makes you smell fresh like vanilla or a bakery! a light fragrance that is nice to wear as a daytime scent.</li>
    <li> How can you beat this deal!? Perfume came nice and fresh and wasn&#x27;t some lame knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;Made a great gift for the gf!</li>
    <li> Bought this and when I got it, it smelled like alcohol! I emailed the seller and this is what I got:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi, I assure you this is a fresh goods, I&#x27;m the official agent for aquolina, I attached the invoice for you to see,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the only one selling Black Sugar from Pink Sugar 2014 in America, not sure what else I can do to convince&lt;br /&gt;you can go buy it from Sephora at $54 I sell to them, you can return it if it&#x27;s sell new unused, I see that you paid $20&lt;br /&gt;maybe $54 is better will make you feel it smells good, I know it&#x27;s all psychological.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible service!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I get lots of compliments on this scent.  Lasts quite a while and you get a good sized bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for a couple of years, so I was really excited to see it at such discounted price on Amazon Prime Day. I received it yesterday and it is not the same fragrance I have been wearing for the past couple of years. It smells horrible. It is discolored. I do not know if it is a very old bottle or was just never stored properly, but it is pretty much going into the trash. Very disappointed, but at least the loss isn&#x27;t huge, as it was only about $17 for the bottle (lesson learned:  you get what you pay for).</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this fragrance.  It is light and fun for the summer and it stays with you all day.</li>
    <li> Smells like cotton candy, only wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY love this spray. It was everything I&#x27;d hoped it would be. The bottle is huge for an AMAZING price. You can count on the fact that when I run low on my current bottle of this, I will certainly be purchasing another.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful!!! I get compliments on it all the time and it makes me feel so girlie when I have it on :)</li>
    <li> I have been in love with this scent for several years and anytime I try another one, I keep coming back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transaction was perfect and very fast.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite smell! It smells like candy and its half the price in stores. It last all day and I always get compliments!</li>
    <li> Great buy!! People always compliment my fragrance.</li>
    <li> Compliments every time I wear it! Smells like cookies or cotton candy.....that&#x27;s what I am told.</li>
    <li> I literally just took this perfume out of the packaging moments ago. It&#x27;s fake. It smells alright but not the way it should. I am very disappointed in amazon. I don&#x27;t know if I will be purchasing from this site anymore. I was once a very loyal customer but that is no longer the case.</li>
    <li> I use this perfume all the time.  Great for daytime.  Smells so delicious, like strawberries.  I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Pink Sugar by Aquolina for over 10 years and, I should&#x27;ve read all of the reviews before ordering both the Pink Sugar and the Gold Sugar Eau de Toilette sprays here.  Exactly as others mentioned, as soon as you open the Pink Sugar packaging, you can see the color is both dark and dingy, nothing like the real deal. The slight scent that was sprayed bore no resemblance to Pink Sugar and dissipated within seconds. I still had another bottle of Pink Sugar at home and was easily able to confirm the Amazon Pink Sugar was not the real deal or perhaps an expired or watered-down bottle. The Gold Sugar, which I&#x27;d never smelled prior to purchasing but was told was very nice, had only a slight scent as well and also dissipated quickly. I took another reviewer&#x27;s advice to contact customer service and I was informed I could either receive a refund or a replacement. I opted for the refund, since others mentioned the replacements were also just as bad. I received a refund within two days, which was satisfactory. Although the Gold Sugar had a barely-there scent, I decided to keep it. Lesson Learned.</li>
    <li> I love it...I spray it on after my shower at night even if I&#x27;m just going to bed because it smells so good.definitely my new favorite!</li>
    <li> I love the fragance. i get so many compliments when i wear this. Every women  should try at least once .</li>
    <li> Smells like a sugar cookie!  Great value for the amount that you pay!  And the smell lasts all day into night!</li>
    <li> Love the perfume, but it seemed to take awhile to arrive compared to previous orders &amp; the package was a hot mess when delivered.</li>
    <li> Well you know the Happy Wife deal. The only thing is that she smells so good that I just want to ... and ... her.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! My favorite type of scent is usually sweet, and this is sweet! When I first smelt Pink Sugar, the scent was sweet and fruity with spice to it. When I put it on, it had the same scent. After a while of wearing it, it faded into a very beautiful, sweet scent. It&#x27;s not an overpowering sweet scent like some other sweet scents can be. It&#x27;s actually like a light cotton candy, sugar, caramel, and licorice scent. It lasts a very long time and everybody loves this scent. If you find the scent doesnt last long on you, try putting petroleum jelly under it or apply a body lotion thats just as sweet as Pink Sugar, preferably the matching lotion!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Fast ship.  Thanks much</li>
    <li> THAT IS A COMPLIMENT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT EVERYONE LIKES EDT OR PERFUMES THAT SMELL LIKE FOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOME MAY NOT FIND THIS SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH, EVEN IF THEY DO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL, I LIKE IT AND APPARENTLY THOSE WHO HAVE SMELLED THIS ON ME, LIKE IT TOO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE BEEN ASKED WHAT I AM WEARING.....WHAT IS THAT YUMMY SCENT EXACTLY ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I GIVE THEM THE NAME AND THEN ADD&amp;#34; IT PROBABLY REMINDS YOU OF COTTON CANDY&amp;#34; AND IT REGISTERS WITH THEM THAT YES, THAT IS THE SCENT THAT WAS COMING TO MIND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I THINK THIS IS A CASUAL , PLAYFUL AND SEXY SCENT.  BUT IF YOU GET COMPLIMENTED ENOUGH, YOU WILL WANT TO WEAR IT FOR ALL TYPES OF OCCASIONS :-)</li>
    <li> Love Love LOVE!! Will definitely order over and over!!!</li>
    <li> The best perfume. Ive had compliments from complete strangers. It smells like cotton candy :)</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter, she loves it.  Will continue to purchase from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I get a ton of compliments form men and women when I wear this perfume! One of my absolute favorites!!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. I get compliments on it and everyone wants to know what and where to get it. Just love it.</li>
    <li> The package arrived in perfect condition, and the Pink Sugar smells heavenly.  Sweet perfumes rarely ever work on me, but this one is the exception.  The scent alternates between a delicate cotton candy, almond marzipan and soft fruit or apricot.  It is so lovely.  I could not be happier with this buying experience, and have no doubt that the perfume is authentic.</li>
    <li> This is one&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s favorite, so she needs a new bottle every year. The price on amazon was awesome. It&#x27;s so good and sweet..perfect for a young girl.</li>
    <li> Never get tired of Pink Sugar like I do with other fragrances...always my go-to favorite cologne...Always get compliments...Love it everyday...</li>
    <li> Reading other reviews about this seller I was hesitant buying but I chanced it and I&#x27;m glad I did! Perfectly new sealed bottle of Pink Sugar at a great price and it smells amazing!! Thank You!</li>
    <li> Be warned, this is a sugary sweet perfume, with just the subtlest hint of spice (to me, I can always catch just a whiff of licorice, which is why this scent has stuck with me all these years.) I have been told that I smell like candy and cupcakes when I wear this though. I first discovered this perfume at Sephora, but since discovering it for sale here on amazon I have never shopped for it elsewhere- it is a bargain at $20!</li>
    <li> I love this spray i get so many compliments saying you smell so good what are you wearing!!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I used to purchase from discount sites but ended up getting&amp;#34;testers&amp;#34; and did not trust the quality.  This purchase was AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I always turn heads when I wear this perfume...I Love This perfume!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell bad but it definitely wasn&#x27;t the original pink sugar. If you&#x27;re looking for the pink sugar you&#x27;re better off buying it from sephora or tj maxx.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume ever!  If you like Cotton Candy, you&#x27;ll love this perfume.  Sometimes people say it smells like candy, or cookies, but what drew me to it, was the cotton candy smell.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Smells great after about 10 minutes from the time you spray it. It needs time to settle. I like it, thinking it&#x27;s missing something.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for years and always get compliments on it.  It&#x27;s becone my signature scent.  I ordered 2...Love it!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t had this perfume since i was in middle school, and I&#x27;m now in college. Im so pleased to have found it at such a great price and it was even larger than i had anticipated. arrived on time as expected. i will absolutely be purchasing more of this product, and maybe checking out the other products offered as well.</li>
    <li> Smelled ok but too strong</li>
    <li> My all time favorite perfume, much cheaper than department stores. This is the only perfume I can wear that won&#x27;t give me a headache, yet smells GREAT.</li>
    <li> Gift for granddaughter.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> One of my most favourite scents, and you can always find a great deal on Amazon. \ (&#x27; ˘ &#x60;) /</li>
    <li> I get compliments every time I wear this scent, from young children to elder folks, as well as complete strangers.</li>
    <li> Product came in time, took a bit long to finally ship though. It is exactly as on the picture and yes it is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;My BF says it smells just like cotton candy, it smells very sweet and good. I use it on my clothes for work and at night to go out. It will linger with you for a whole day without loosing scent. It is really good and I can highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a sweeter younger smell thou so someone in their 40ies it might be too young.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite scents; in still using this a year later.</li>
    <li> I love pink sugar. However this seller is not selling pink sugar. Several people told me I smelt like alcohol. Not very good in the work force.</li>
    <li> My new favorite! One thing I don&#x27;t understand is why the color of the liquid is different from one bottle to the next.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like musk scents, so its hard to find a warm fragrance. This one is perfect. Sweet without smelling like cupcakes and warm and sugary. Great for an everyday or special occasion scent. Also not too overpowering but it lasts all day on me.</li>
    <li> not the same item as pictured was disappointed, but amazon was very good in understanding and advised me to leave the feedback regarding the item. There was no red pepper on it and it did not say Aquolina anywhere on bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. So much cheaper to purchase online.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance; It is very rich, long lasting. I am delighted with this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I Love Pink Sugar Perfume by Aquolina... But that&#x27;s not what I got. Instead I got a cheap perfume at my door step today. Pure Pink by Karen Low. I opened the box and I was shocked that it was not pink sugar but I thought &amp;#34;hey maybe they changed the name&amp;#34; I opened the box to smell the perfume and what do you know.... does not smell like pink sugar.... HEY THANKS FOR THE WRONG PERFUME when I paid for PINK SUGAR!!!</li>
    <li> I work in a Doctors office and I am constantly told how wonderful I smell, words like Intoxicating, Delicious, Warm, Candy, Cookies and Divine are often used by Men and Women. It&#x27;s not overpowering, and my husband absolutely loves it, he can&#x27;t get enough of me when I wear it, which is every day. This and one other often layered together is my Signature Fragrance. I walk by and hear people say Mmmmmm, what is that? Love, Love, Love this and on Amazon the price just can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Mine smelt really weird, nothing like Cottencandy or anything else remotely sweet...</li>
    <li> Not only does this smell delicious but it is great for when my cat sprays in the house because it is not too strong, fades quickly but the cat odor smell is completely gone for weeks after just using a few sprays, and this scent does not give me a headache or have that alcohol strength smell to it which I like, I don&#x27;t use it much for perfume because I feel like it smells like youth and I am an older woman, but the smell is just like cotton candy and reminds you of happy days when you were a child like at a fair or something, the smell has a happy smell that&#x27;s why I like it for a scent in my house.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and it&#x27;s so much cheaper on here then it is anywhere! I get non stop compliments on how good it smells and if you spray too much it isn&#x27;t overwhelming just makes you smell like something baking in a bakery :-) it lingers and stays on you for hours!!</li>
    <li> Smells like cotton candy and angels</li>
    <li> Great price for this perfume! I&#x27;ve been wearing it everyday for about 4 years.</li>
    <li> Tried this scent in store and knew I had to have it. It is the perfect soft,  summer scent!&lt;br /&gt;I just found my new go-to fragrance.</li>
    <li> I get more complements on this perfume than any other I wear. Great price and will make you feel girly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Aqualina pink sugar for years! It&#x27;s a favorite in my family! Love this yummy scent! At this price, it&#x27;s a must buy!</li>
    <li> YUMMY!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am addicted to this scent.  LOVE IT, scented like candy!  and you soon will grow to love it.  Goes on strong and leaves a great scent!  Can&#x27;t say enough.!</li>
    <li> Need to re-order… The color looked kind of yellow but it smelled so good!</li>
    <li> Excellent sweet fragrance. Wears all day. Many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;However when the package (s) arrived for the one or two&lt;br /&gt;bottles I ordered, I had 5 !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Both of my daughters love this!  In fact I do too and my husband likes it too.  Smells really good just need one little spray.  Great scent at a great price!</li>
    <li> Nice cotton candy fragrance! I think this is the right amount of sweet. And I love the packaging and the name!</li>
    <li> This is one of my all-time favorite scents, and I have received so many compliments on it from friends and coworkers.  Just this morning, when one of my coworkers walked past my desk she said, \\&quot;Something smells good...\\&quot;  A few minutes later, my boss walked into the office and said \\&quot;hey....it smells like cotton candy!  Anyone smell that??\\&quot;  I smiled and said, \\&quot;it&#x27;s me....it&#x27;s Pink Sugar!\\&quot;  I love that it is sweet and yummy, but not overpowering in any way.  I also love that I can STILL smell it on me, 12 hours after spraying it on!  Lovely, sweet, and everyone seems to love it.  How could anyone resist the scent of cotton candy?  I just ordered my third (3.4 oz) bottle of this beautiful potion.  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. Everyone compliments me on the scent. It is by far my favorite scent, ever!</li>
    <li> for granddaughter...she will love it</li>
    <li> Ok, true story. Yesterday I went to the doctor and when I walked into the lobby this guy said to me, OMG you smell SOOO good!  Then, when I got up to the receptionist desk the lady said, You smell so good, what is that!  repeat this two more times when I walked across the hall for Labwork. I was just laughing when I left thinking I have never had that many compliments in a half hour in my whole 52 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greatest thing about this scent is the staying power. You literally can put it on in the morning and still smell it --  a bit more faintly in the evening. I don&#x27;t have any other designer fragrances that have that long-lasting effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the Pink Sugar Sensual for a go- round too. Hopefully it will be just as lovely as the original.  Moral of the story, if you smell something good in the area --it&#x27;s probably ME!</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; smells amazing</li>
    <li> LOVE Pink Sugar!  It smells like cotton candy with a little caramel. It is my all-time favorite perfume and has gotten me more compliments than any perfume that I have ever owned.  I have used it for a long time and was very surprised at the great price of this 3.4 oz spray.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I saw it in a department store and loved, loved it.  But when I started using this, pretty much all I could smell was the alcohol.  Since this was the first time purchasing perfume, I had no idea it was not the same as in the department store.  It didn&#x27;t say imitation or I would not have bought it.  I&#x27;m new to purchasing on Amazon.  This I would never buy again.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great size! Smell just like it should, I was nervous about getting a fake, but it was definitely the originial thing.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised this was the large size and previously paid almost the same for a much smaller size. Should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I work in a restaurant, this scent actually blends with the food smells in dining room. It has great lasting power too.</li>
    <li> I have loved Aquolina&#x27;s Pink Sugar fragrance for about 10-11 years.  It smells sweet and yummy and sensual, and men absolutely adore it! Whenever I wear it, I get compliments from men, women and children. People stop me in the store and ask what that wonderful smell is. This product I bought on amazon.com is the genuine product with the same packaging as when I buy it at Nordstrom or sephora.com. The price is fantastic, and the only problem I had was that I couldn&#x27;t get the bottle out of the cylinder without destroying the cylinder. The bottle had two glue spots holding it to the base of the cylinder. I bought 2 of them, and with both of them, they were undamaged and smell fresh, and the coloring is correct, also. I&#x27;m going to buy a few more, because I&#x27;m afraid maybe it will be discontinued soon. I can&#x27;t figure out any other reason it is so inexpensive. I still have partial bottles left over from Nordstrom and Sephora, and they are identical. Everything I totally love or get addicted to gets discontinued. (Personal Touch razor blades, Diva perfume, Coriander perfume, Crabtree &amp; Evelyn sandalwood &amp; patchouli products, and so on) Buy it while you can!</li>
    <li> Smells like cotton candy. Love it. I am always getting complements</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for years and I always get compliments on it!</li>
    <li> Just love it!!! I get so many compliments on how good I smell...</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this perfume. I use it like crazy.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love the way this smells! Everyone in my family uses it. Its such a sweet girly scent my daughter sometimes asks to be sprayed with it</li>
    <li> Love the product but bottle leaks amd was half gone when I received it</li>
    <li> love this perfume, get compliments on at every day at least once a day!  And the price was great.</li>
    <li> She loves it. It is the best she has ever had.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.....it is a great buy!!!  I initially bought this at Sephora when I tried it for the first time, definitely toooooo expensive.  SO happy I found it on Amazon, I will be buying more.  I&#x27;ve turned friends on to Pink Sugar...now I give it as gifts!!!</li>
    <li> I wear this every day and have comments all the time.  Usually people do not know it is, but comment on the wonderful smell.  I have heard things like sugar cookies, cotton candy, vanilla, cakes, etc.  It is a soft fragrance, but does have the vanilla</li>
    <li> I have to spray like 10 times to get a good smell!!! It&#x27;s obviously fake but I didn&#x27;t pay a fake price!! It&#x27;s my favorite smell and I wasted my money on a fake!! #trying to get a deal and got robbed!</li>
    <li> Long lasting smell of deliciousness.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone would like it.&lt;br /&gt;Sweet and light but stays on all day and continuing!!!&lt;br /&gt;A MUST GET!!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $22.00 ( or whatever the price is today), it is FAKE,  it is at least the very least sub standard. I LOVE the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Pink Sugar but this is not it. It took me a while to figure out that it was fake. I had my suspicions but my husband bought me a $60 bottle from Ulta recently and THIS is definitely not the real deal. Every time I wear the real stuff I get compliments. I never get a compliment when I wear this fake one. It smells right when you first put it on but it ends there. Also, this liquid is piss yellow. The real thing is clear. I&#x27;m really ticked that I was duped.</li>
    <li> This perfume may not be designer but I have to tell you, whenever I wear it people often compliment me on it. It is very sweet but not in an old lady way, more of a &#x27;young-fresh and summer/beach-yummy&#x27; sort of way. It compliments Victoria&#x27;s secret scented lotions really well and basically when you wear it you turn into a walking cube of brown sugar. Even some friends who swear up and down that they don&#x27;t like sugary-scents have complimented me when I wear it and then they get all defensive when I tell them what I&#x27;m wearing lol... I mean who doesn&#x27;t like the smell of a sweet factory?</li>
    <li> this is amazing perfume, I love super sweet perfumes and this one is the best I have found so far!</li>
    <li> one of my wife&#x27;s favorites</li>
    <li> I always wear this perfume. I normally use it on a daily basis and i saw the GREAT price on amazon and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I normally buy it in the store for $28.00. I got it and started using it and realized that it HARDLY smelled like anything.&lt;br /&gt;So I went to the store and bought a new bottle. To my surprise the new bottle&#x27;s perfume was a yellow hue. The one i bought on Amazon is CLEAR!!! I&#x27;m super upset that i can&#x27;t even return it and get my money back! Ridiculous! Save your money!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this type of scent. It&#x27;s sweet and innocent but has a caramel/vanilla note to it that keeps it from being too childish of a scent. When I first sprayed this on I thought it was slightly overwhelming but I do not fault the perfume for that - I think I sprayed it on a little heavy at first. I love the fragrance even more as it has a few minutes to mellow and adapt to my skin. It&#x27;s so delicious smelling, I am so glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I ordered a glass bottle, like in the picture. I was very satisfied when I ordered this a year ago, and I got what i wanted. So of course when I ran out i ordered more. What i recieved in the mail today wasnt a glass bottle, it was a plastic bottle and i thought maybe they changed it. but when i sprayed it it was no where near as strong as what i had previously gotten, i am very upset with this.  it&#x27;s almost like a body spray, not a perfume.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it.  Good price.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old loves this perfume! it smells really good, kind fruitty obviously. Its a good choice for a girl present.</li>
    <li> I ordered this the other day and was so excited for the perfume. I love the smell but can&#x27;t find it any of my local stores. I read the reviews and say that recently people said it was legit so I took the risk and ordered it. I got it in the mail and immediately opened the package up and sprayed it on my wrist. It smelled HORRIBLE. Nothing like it was supposed to. I am not sure if there was a bad batch, it was old, or if it was knock off but I know it wasn&#x27;t Pink Sugar.</li>
    <li> Good friend loves it, she can&#x27;t stop thanking me!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! Vanilla and caramel. My husband says I smell edible, can&#x27;t beat that! By far my favorite! :)</li>
    <li> I have had gentlemen comment it smells slightly like spun sugar.  Nice hint of musk!  I love it and have reordered as well.</li>
    <li> Not my kind of scent. I was going for a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; smell, but this perfume smells totally like a cloyingly sweet dessert. I put int on, did not like it and tried to wipe it off. It&#x27;s very strong. At work, I had people comment in the elevator and around my desk, statements like &amp;#34; I smell cookies&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that smell? Donuts?&amp;#34;, and then they would look at me. I don&#x27;t want to smell like a confection, thank you. I threw it away.</li>
    <li> People are always telling me how good I smell!  I LOVE this scent!!!  I will be smelling good for a long time to come ;-)</li>
    <li> I made this purchase online for a gift. It was packaged to perfection.. Very we&#x27;ll protected and fast. It not easy buying online when your not sure of a product. Just made another order, had to have some for myself...</li>
    <li> Smells so good, but isn&#x27;t so strong that I smell like Hollister or Abercrombie.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a perfume to make you fall in love , then Aquolina Pink Sugar is it. Many say I smell like Cotton Candy, and I only need to spray a few times  to get  an all day lasting scent. Everyone comments on this perfume when I use it, and I have been wearing it for over 10 years, Heaven in a pink bottle that i will always cherish.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Great Price!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It smells like cotton candy. The scent is perfect for teens and adults. I have been using this for years and I love it</li>
    <li> Husband bought this for me for Christmas knowing my bottle was nearly empty.  When I opened it I knew immediately that something was wrong.  The color was such a dark golden yellow color.  That&#x27;s not normal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t smell the same.  It still smelled&lt;br /&gt;good but takes a lot more sprays to match the strength of the real stuff.  It also doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  And again, what you&#x27;re smelling is not actual Pink Sugar (though it&#x27;s close).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe it was just old and expired but then I purchased another bottle from Ulta and compared the two.  First, the label on the bottom is totally different.  The print on the bottle doesn&#x27;t quite match uP.  I&#x27;m going to try to post pictures.  Compared to a bottle of Pink Sugar side by side, the darkness is horribly obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon about it and they refunded his money.  I notified them it was fake.  They didn&#x27;t seem to care much.  They need to pull this item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time, do not buy.  It&#x27;s not worth the super low price because it&#x27;s not real!</li>
    <li> Smells so good, sweet. Got perfume on time and it was packaged well. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing sweet smell! Kinda reminds me of cotton candy. My daughter wears this and it doesn&#x27;t give either of us migraines! We are both very sensitive to smells. Although it is a VERY strong scent, it is amazing and we will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I think this is a fake.. It doesn&#x27;t smell like the real pink sugar and gives me a headache.</li>
    <li> Smells super fab makes you smell like a girly girl</li>
    <li> I love this perfume &amp; get a lot of positive comments on it when I wear it. It&#x27;s a nice fresh, sweet smell tha isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; sweet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume before and it&#x27;s as good as usual.  Smells like cotton candy. People compliment it whenever I wear it.</li>
    <li> love this stuff.. and totally beats paying $70 for it like i would at the perfume shop</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying this, hoping to get the cotton candy smell many have mentioned.  I had some doubts after reading reviews online stating there were some unpleasant scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it on a piece of tissue and could smell a faint, sweet cotton candy scent.  I sprayed it on my arm and it was stronger than on the paper, but not in a good way.  Instead of cotton candy, I got a licorice scent, something bitter, and a burnt jellybean smell.  Not horrible, but not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried Aquolina Gold Sugar at the same time.  I sprayed it on my wrist to compare to pink sugar.  I really didn&#x27;t like either one.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was one or both, but something irritated my throat a half hour after applying them.  It cleared up, and if I try them again, it will be separately to see if it happens again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t wash the spray off, waiting to see if they changed over time.  It got better.  Not as strong.  I noticed that if I smell the scent right on my skin, there are synthetic odors that bother me.  But if I don&#x27;t get too close, it is okay.  Occasionally I get a whiff of something sweet and I like it.  After about 4 hours of wearing it, the scent has become faint, but I still smell it now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is nice.  The scent is okay.  I would not purchase this again.  Not sure if it&#x27;s old stock as someone else mentioned, but, I&#x27;d probably try it in a store if I come across it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this perfume and the price is a lot better on Amazon than at the retail store.</li>
    <li> i have been buying this perfume since 2010 and still love it.. smell like candy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, not my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> I like this but I don&#x27;t love it, it is defiantly ok and if you like sweet smelling perfumes than this may be for you.  I purchased this after being on a Comptoir Sud vanilla etc perfume kick and I defiantly prefer that brand to this.  THis is a decent back-up but I just didn&#x27;t love it the way that others do.</li>
