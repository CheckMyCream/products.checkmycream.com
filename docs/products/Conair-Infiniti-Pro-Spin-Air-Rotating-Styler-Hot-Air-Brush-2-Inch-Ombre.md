      <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice to not need to hold a brush to style my hair.</li>
      <li>My own observation is, if the brush were to be another inch or two in length</li>
      <li>It gave me a clean, smooth surface and some excellent volume.  </li>
      <li>It gave me a clean, smooth surface and some excellent volume.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended, best beauty tool I own</li>
      <li>good features include the sideways plug, always a treasure to find when one is fitting many appliances into a surge protector.</li>
      <li>works fairly well but hair does tangle easily</li>
      <li>very easy to learn how to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is good for finishing up the styling process if you have thicker hair but not as a primary hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the end result, because it just made my hair look like I had set my hair in old fashioned rollers.</li>
      <li>Which is ideal for me, but if your hair is very course</li>
      <li>Love love love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise, this is exactly what I needed and am happy I got it.  </li>
      <li>It seemed too good to be true.</li>
      <li>The best way to set hair, as I believed, was to heat it, and then cool it off fast to set the curl.  </li>
      <li>She was also quite pleased with the results, and is thinking of ordering one herself.</li>
      <li>and I still think I can get my hair better if I do it manually myself.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since my own daughter wasn&#x27;t available for a trial use, I asked my niece to give it a try.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK for AA hair</li>
      <li>overall it works GREAT!!</li>
      <li>So much better than the electric hair rollers I had been using.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT, I already have the &#x27;Infiniti Pro&#x27; with the 2 inch barrel.</li>
      <li>Most days I don&#x27;t have the time to bother with blowing out my hair, but when I do, this is the way I go.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Styler BC179\\&quot; is almost a perfect styling tool - especially for those who have dexterity issues when it comes to handling a styling brush AND a hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>you are looking for a styling tool that combines the features of and performs the functions of two styling implements in a more space-saving form, you should consider the \\&quot;Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Styler BC179\\&quot;.  </li>

      <li>and, while I&#x27;m glad I was able to try it out, ended up giving it to my sister to use.</li>
      <li>At a salon, when you&#x27;re reading a magazine and paying a stylist $60 to style your hair, sure, let her him or her spend 45 minutes pulling and rolling it one strand, one layer at a time, but</li>
      <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
      <li>This is way better than the instyler</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I will use it once in a while.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this brush tangles your hair and eventually after a few uses maybe three does smooth it out but at what cost it messes your hair up unless you have thin hair i guess it works but i have thick curly hair and it was not my cup of tea(reviewing from my husband&#x27;s account)</li>
    <li> I liked this brush, especially the rotation of it (once I got used to it) but the downside is that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; your hair like a hairbrush does, so it&#x27;s hard to get a &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; without needing to use your hands to get it attached to your hair. And then you run into the issue of the tool getting too hot to touch (mainly towards the end of it) and you can actually burn yourself if not careful. I have shoulder length hair that&#x27;s cut in a long shag style, so this diameter is the perfect size (at 1 1/2 inches). It wouldn&#x27;t work very well at all with shorter lengths, unless you just want to smooth out the texture but not put waves into it. It blows air stronger than the John Frieda brush, but doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; the hair quite as well. Both of these are practically identical, when it comes to size and how it feels to hold. Having the rotation with this one is a plus, BUT the downside is that the bristles don&#x27;t &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; your hair like a hairbrush, making it difficult to &amp;#34;get a grip&amp;#34; on your hair. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Just had my hair cut to a chin length layered bob, and was struggling to get my slightly wavy and fine hair into the same sleek straight style as my hairdresser. This works BRILLIANTLY! After a bit of practice, my best results are to towel dry, use some sort of styling mousse (any - none are any better than any other, in my life long experience!) and get some good hair claws so you can do a section at a time. Like any appliance, and to get good results with anything in life, you need a bit of practice, but it&#x27;s honestly far superior to the two handed operation of a brush and a normal hairdryer. If it broke tomorrow I&#x27;d still get another one.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift 4 months ago. Working well.</li>
    <li> Sorry but his brush is meant for someone who has very thin hair and does not need a lot of drying. The brush did absolutely nothing ofr me and i returned it.  I was hopng it would.</li>
    <li> This tool broke on the fifth use. The switch simply no longer worked.</li>
    <li> This works well to dry and straighten with a slight wave at the end of hair but does not curl, and you can only do a little hair at a time.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have baby fine thin hair. This along with Loreal shampoo and gel for thin hair has changed my hair completely!</li>
    <li> A neat gadget. Doesn&#x27;t get super hot but is enough to get smooth curves.</li>
    <li> Does nothing for my short, fine hair. It doesn&#x27;t matter if use a lot of styles mg products or none.</li>
    <li> works fairly well but hair does tangle easily</li>
    <li> the brush bristles fall out. but my hair is thick.</li>
    <li> Very good appliance specially for short hair, that can be styled with volume and shine with no effort.</li>
    <li> I hate this. The brush got tangled in my hair multiple times and some of the bristles came off after just one use. I had so much hair around the brush and on the floor when I was done! I could not flip the ends of my hair out which I thought the spinning function would help with. I got the John Frieda hot air brush. While that one is not perfect either, I like it better plus it is cheaper. I wanted to like the conair but unfortunately it did not work for me. I am returning it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because it arrived quickly and works with no problems. I bought this to make it easier to straighten my fine, curly hair. I usually use a round brush and blow dryer. First off, I recognize this isn&#x27;t strong enough to dry wet hair. I tried to dry my hair about 80% before using it. Even using tiny sections, it just didn&#x27;t straighten the top part of my hair, leaving bumps - and the bottom part was overly dry and frizzy (high or low setting). My hair is not coarse or tight curls. This was a huge disappointment!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have short hair and the 1.5 in. was just right.</li>
    <li> Bristles too soft to grab hair.</li>
    <li> Thought I would like it but it was not worth it. My hair is a little longer that shoulder length and was a pain to use. Short hair maybe.</li>
    <li> Good for short hair....tangles in long hair.  Makes very shinny</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Use it every day.  So much better than the electric hair rollers I had been using.</li>
    <li> The Infinity Pro dried  and shaped my hair in minutes. It also left my hair shiny with easy movement.</li>
    <li> I have used the 2 inch Infiniti Pro for a couple of years. I love it. My hair is fine and thin, and this gives my hair volume and shine. I called Conair last year to see if they have a smaller one, but at the time they didn&#x27;t. I was so happy to see that they now make the 1 1/2 inch one because my hair is short, and the 2 inch really is too big. I highly recommend this product. It is the only one I have found that rotates.</li>
    <li> Good results in its use. Is very practical</li>
    <li> Does a great job of smoothing hair and giving it a nice shape.  I have naturally straight flat hair and this brush adds a lot of body.  I do wish the air was a bit hotter and sometimes it pulls hair if you don&#x27;t make sure it&#x27;s properly aligned on the barrel.  Over all, I really like it and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is fairly simple to use however the end of it is not designed very well. There is a small gap, where the end cap meets the roller brush, and your hair will get caught in it and yanked out. So I have to leave that part full of my hair to reduce the amount of hair I am loosing when using the brush. If they would fix that I would give it 5 stars. I do really like the results I get when using it!</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s so nice to not need to hold a brush to style my hair. I really like the 11/2&amp;#34; barrel. The stores near me only have the 2&amp;#34;, which doesn&#x27;t give me the fullness I need.</li>
    <li> This curler/hair dryer works quite well, even though it&#x27;s a tad too big.  Makes doing my hair a one step effort, using only one hand.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> Spins great but my hair seemed coarse/rough</li>
    <li> awful.  Arrived  with America voltage  and 2 pin plug.  Could have blown myself up if I had tried to change plug to  English  3 pin plug.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM !!!</li>
    <li> Great product....one thing tho..its prob best to use with DRY hair...overall it works GREAT!!</li>
    <li> does not blow hot enough air for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time!  Its easier to use a blow dryer and a brush. My hair was almost completely dry when I tied using this piece of junk and it didn&#x27;t even blow enough air to move my hair much less do a very minimal dry.  It doesn&#x27;t help with any type of volume boosting.  And the handle is so big that it is nearly impossible to hold comfortably or for any amount of time. If you have dainty hands you wouldn&#x27;t be able to hold it.  I really miss the one I had for years that finally gave out (it was a different brand).</li>
    <li> I have relatively short hair and am totally pleased with the spin styler.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really big and very heavy .....</li>
    <li> I believe this particular product that I received was defective.  I sent it back because it made a strange sound when turned on.  I do own the exact product in a 2 inch and LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I was unfortunately disappointed by this product as it did not match the criteria as explained in the online description. The hair sticks to the styler and is very difficult to remove later on plus it doenot even do a great job at straightening the curls!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to look for another styler now.</li>
    <li> Made a strange noise. returned</li>
    <li> I have the 2&amp;#34; and it works perfectly.  The 1 1/2&amp;#34; grabs my hair and just ends up nest to by scalp.</li>
    <li> pulls the hair/hard to use/may need to return it</li>
    <li> Initially I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this dryer. Flatly there was some user error going on. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get the brush to hold your hair. Oh yeah - those two buttons between the brush and the handle? THEY control brush rotation. Once I figured that out I was on my way to 1976 Farrah Fawcett hair. This can give you some pretty nice volume and create a feathered or slightly wavy look (not curls exactly..more like volume up). It works very well on my shorter fine hair that is naturally curly. Be sure you use a gel or creme if you want your hair to grip and hold better - at least if you have fine hair. My daughter has thick hair that is much coarser and this was did not really work well for her at all - lots of pain and pulling but then she has naturally much curlier hair. This is probably for those of us who are trying to relive our glory days of Madonna&#x27;s 80 hair volume - and for that this machine is just perfect!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT, I already have the &#x27;Infiniti Pro&#x27; with the 2 inch barrel. This one&#x27;s barrel is about 1/2 inch smaller, so you need to be a little more careful as it can suddenly grab your hair, but after a couple of uses you get used to it, and you simpley have to stop the rotation or just put it into reverse.&#x60;(just common sense really) I have medium lenght hair, and alternate between both of them. and get an amazing smooth eligant hair style. I loved this product so much, I sent to England for another one, (the voltage is different there)  that way I have one to take with me when I tavel to Europe. Dont think I can recomend this styler any higher, except maybe to give it 10 stars.</li>
    <li> So glad to find in a smaller size. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this hot air spinner by Conair!</li>
    <li> I bought the non spinning version of this Conair Styler about a year ago and it leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky. I was excited to try the spinning version and a little nervous too as I thought it might create a mass of tangles and knots in my fine hair which is cut in a chin length Bob. No tangles! No knots! No frustration! very easy to learn how to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my hair at night but in the morning it is totally bent out of shape, I&#x27;m a real BED HEAD!  A spray bottle of water and this styler gets my hair back in shape in just a couple of minutes and it lasts and looks as good as it does when I walk out of one of those Blow Dry Salons. I am thrilled that I got to test this Hot Air rotating styler brush- it is fabulous!</li>
    <li> I got this dryer for my daughter because she is always looking for ways to protect her hair.  She loves it because it doesn&#x27;t damage her hair and gives her new ways to style.  Whether she wants to go with it straight or more full, she has the ability to get what she wants without frying the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What struck me when I saw how it works was the fact that it took so long for this type of product to be available.  It seems like a simple idea that I&#x27;ve only just now heard of.  If you have long hair and are trying to preserve the ends while still having fun with different styles, my daughter highly recommends the Pro Spin.  : )</li>
    <li> The InfinitiPro spin air rotating styler works well and saves time. It heats up almost instantly and dries and curls at the same time, making your hair look good, not frizzy and with a nice curl. Here&#x27;s a tip: drying and styling very wet hair can take a long time. The best way to go at it is to towel dry your hair first until it&#x27;s damp and then use the styler to finish the job.</li>
    <li> I love this machine! I got praised on the first day after using it! my hair is naturally curl, so it&#x27;s always hard to keep it a A-shape without flipping ends. But this machine made my hair in a good shape with shine. Love it!</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Styler BC179\\&quot; is almost a perfect styling tool - especially for those who have dexterity issues when it comes to handling a styling brush AND a hair dryer.  Not only does this styling tool combine the two, it is much lighter than many hand-held hairdryers. It also does an excellent job of adding volume to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The barrel of the \\&quot;Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Styler BC179\\&quot; is the color of an eggplant.  The styling brush bristles are soft; they do not, whether using the rotating feature or not, scratch or scrape your scalp.  A protective shield prevents damage to the brush bristles when the styling tool is being stored.  If you travel and throw this unit into your suitcase, the shield should prevent snagging of your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the protective brush shield, the \\&quot;Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Styler BC179\\&quot; weighs approximately 12 ½ oz. The bottom of the barrel - where many individuals may hold the styling tool - is approximately 7\\&quot; in circumference; the top portion near the heat and spin controls is approximately 6\\&quot; in circumference.  These dimensions may make holding it more difficult for those having smaller hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to engage the spin feature, you must maintain pressure on the spin control button.  This is both a plus and a minus.  For those having arthritis or other hand-related issues, maintaining a constant pressure with one&#x27;s thumb is difficult.  By gripping the barrel and using my middle finger to apply pressure to the control, I was able to keep the spin feature engaged.  The spin feature works well and will not tangle your hair - if you keep moving the brush through your hair while styling.  If you stop and hold the brush in one area, it will tangle.  However, because you only need release the spin control button, you will not damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;high\\&quot; heat setting on this styling tool is not excessively hot.  It took about five minutes longer to dry my hair than when I use my Remington hairdryer.  I liked that this because it helps prevent heat damage to \\&quot;color refreshed\\&quot; or fragile hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Styler BC179\\&quot; worked well for styling my chin-length hair.  It gave me a clean, smooth surface and some excellent volume.  The one downside in using this tool for styling was that my bangs looked as if they had been \\&quot;oversped\\&quot; - they were sticking straight out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a styling tool that combines the features of and performs the functions of two styling implements in a more space-saving form, you should consider the \\&quot;Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Styler BC179\\&quot;.

    <li> I loved it however just too big for my short hair so sent it back and e-mailed Conair asking for a small one.  Was informed not in the plans as yet,</li>
    <li> My wife used this rotating styler on her damp medium-to-long hair.  She has thick hair so it&#x27;s typically hard to style it with anything other than a straightener.  She usually straightens her hair, but used this to add volume and waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- instant heat, so no warm-up time needed&lt;br /&gt;- rotates both ways, so easy to flip the curl&lt;br /&gt;- thick enough to take a large section of hair&lt;br /&gt;- style stayed the entire day&lt;br /&gt;- options for both low and high heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- hair had to semi-dry in order to speed up the process&lt;br /&gt;- causes tangles the first few times you use it due to inexperience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, she recommends it as a way to give you style without spending too much time.</li>
    <li> Love love love this thing. Had it for about two years now. Most days I don&#x27;t have the time to bother with blowing out my hair, but when I do, this is the way I go. So easy to use, I could never master the technique of a brush in one hand and blow dryer in the other. Highly recommended, best beauty tool I own</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had neck surgery and holding a dryer and a brush to style my hair is next to impossible due to weakness in my arms, but this is my 2nd one I&#x27;ve purchased except I bought the smaller size since I now have short hair!  It&#x27;s the best ever!!  Very light! It&#x27;s a perfect product for ppl like me!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK for AA hair (I have fine texlaxed hair that is prone to frizz and dryness) It curls the hair nicely and when you first use it, it is like going to the Dominican salon. It looks scary but does not pull out your hair at all really; the bristles are very soft. Gives the hair body and volume. This product does NOT get my hair straight by any means, the hair frizzes back up quickly. It&#x27;s good if you want that &amp;#34;natural blow dried hair curled and full of volume&amp;#34; look but not if you are seeking sleek tresses. It may be that I need to use some different products to keep it from reverting. I&#x27;m sure I will use it once in a while.</li>
    <li> 5 stars. Enough said.</li>
    <li> An Air Brush Styler You&#x27;ll Either Love or Hate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable smoothness and softness on my shoulder length wavy, curly, frizzy hair that only gets salon blowouts for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t managed or mastered the two-handed blow dry with round brush and hair dryer.  That effort takes me an hour (ain&#x27;t got time for that!), my arms get so tired and  the poor results means I&#x27;m gonna wear a bun after all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When offered this product I initially passed it by because I had visions of the rotating brush tangled in my bird nest of hair. 1,500 other customers reviewed this air styler since 2011 with good and not so good opinions. The insights from other customers bolstered my confidence and I took the leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the 1 1/2 inch diameter brush version of the styler, here are some observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Reduces the time and frustration of using a blow dryer and round brush for styling,&lt;br /&gt;- Hair is noticeably smoother and softer without frizz,&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use with 3 heat settings: Low, High, Cool, 2 buttons control brush rotation directions&lt;br /&gt;- I had no incidents with the brush getting tangled  in my hair,&lt;br /&gt;- Best used on hair chin length or longer,&lt;br /&gt;- Works best on hair sectioned with clips that is nearly dry or barely damp; not enough heat to quickly dry wet hair,&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t replace a hair dryer, rough drying is necessary,&lt;br /&gt;- Delivers volume and waves NOT curls,&lt;br /&gt;- It takes practice, practice, practice to get optimal results,e.g. holding the brush in place a few seconds for root lift,. where and how to section and clip hair to get volume where you want it, using the cool shot to set the wave...,&lt;br /&gt;- When not in use protect the brush bristles with the provided cover&lt;br /&gt;- Be careful handling the filter it&#x27;s small, very delicate mesh not a slice of foam material.</li>
    <li> Got this and had to try it right away because I recently got my hair cut and I want to add height to the crown. This is not great on short hair, maybe I should&#x27;ve known that, but it also doesn&#x27;t dry hair too quickly either, it takes longer than expected. It&#x27;s sort of a stubby brush but very sturdy handle.</li>
    <li> I received the Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Styler and gave a try soon after. I have short naturally curly hair. I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the end result, because it just made my hair look like I had set my hair in old fashioned rollers. This is a look I try to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister also has course, curly hair, thick and long and she straightens it with a brush and dryer. I asked her to try this item, and it did a great job on her hair, and gave her the result she hoped for. Her hair was smooth and fluffy when she was through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my own daughter wasn&#x27;t available for a trial use, I asked my niece to give it a try. She has thinner, straight hair. She was also quite pleased with the results, and is thinking of ordering one herself. My own observation is, if the brush were to be another inch or two in length it would get the job done more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now remember, this is a styler, not a hair dryer. If used on slightly damp hair it works great. Do not expect it to dry your hair. It is my opinion that it will give it a fuller, smoother appearance no matter what your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So,</li>
    <li> This is just OK&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;sorta of a two in one, style and dry at same time&lt;br /&gt;price&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;heavy&lt;br /&gt;could use a little more power&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sort of in the middle on this one.</li>
    <li> While I do like my InStyler, it only rotates in one direction. This makes it absolutely useless for the left side of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do miss the clamp-down style of heating mechanism the InStyler has. You can really pull hard and manipulate it. But, I was pleasantly surprised at what a good alternative this was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a ton of fine, naturally bone-straight hair, so I mostly used it to get a slight curl and some volume. Big, thick, retro waves. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the boar bristles, thinking they wouldn&#x27;t be adequate to grab and hold enough of my hair to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, not only does the barrel heat up fairly well, but the rotation seems strong and the bristles seem to catch my hair well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if InStyler ever makes a rotating iron that goes in both directions like this one does, I&#x27;ll go back to that in a heartbeat</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer I have ever had - so easy to use.</li>
    <li> This rotating curling brush is the best invention since sliced bread!  I am not young and have never quite mastered the blow dryer in one hand and a brush in the other!  After all, I grew up in the age of real rollers and thought I died and went to Heaven when hot curlers hit the market!  This rotating brush works great for my short hair and leaves it full of volume and easy to curl with a curling iron if I choose a curlier style.  I just wish they made one with a 1&amp;#34; barrel for a little tighter curl so I could eliminate the curling iron altogether.</li>
    <li> Like the ease. Like the spinning. Like the heat. The brush bristles need to be stiffer for my thick hair. It would get 5🌟 if I had finer hair. So it is not perfect for me</li>
    <li> its not that good, but if you have the time it can help</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the John Frieda Hot Air Brush for over a year now and love it, but I always wondered if the rotating brushes were better. Maybe I&#x27;ve just become so use to my regular non-rotating hot air brush that I&#x27;m a bit set in my ways, but this was NOT a better alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it&#x27;s BIG. Like, incredibly awkward and cumbersome to hold while trying to dry/style your hair. I was constantly mixing up the rotating buttons and would end up going in the wrong direction whenever I switched sides. Not the end of world since regular daily usage would most likely fix that, but it never felt comfortable in my hands. I always felt like I was trying not to drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue is the heat...or lack thereof. This brush alone will not dry your hair. You&#x27;ll need to use a traditional hair dryer first to get your hair about 80% dry, then come in with this guy and use it to straighten and smooth. While I was already used to this routine since I have to do the same thing with the John Frieda brush, this brush seems to have a lot less heat coming from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while this isn&#x27;t a terrible brush, it&#x27;s just large and unwieldy. I tried it for about 4 days before ditching it to go back to my original. I was never comfortable using this and, while I&#x27;m glad I was able to try it out, ended up giving it to my sister to use.</li>
    <li> Works great. It gives my fine and thin hair body.  Easy to use.  Also gives my hair a great shine.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic styling tool, with the added feature of simultaneous gentle drying. The rotating feature of the brush is such a smart invention, and makes it easier to dry/style the hair in back. I am certain that it must also be a great advantage for anyone with limited hand and wrist mobility.</li>
    <li> Good for styling hair and bed head in the morning. Wish it came in a smaller roller.Would be great for long hair. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I have a daughter with naturally curly hair that is fine, and completely out of control (bed head) if it isn&#x27;t tamed with hair products.  When I came across this item looking for a round brush, I instantly purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has made it much easier for me to dry both of my girls&#x27; hair (twin 6 year olds).  To make the fine haired one look nice, I use this and it creates a nice bob look for her short hair.  It would be nice if her naturally curly hair didn&#x27;t frizz and look awful, but it does - and this product makes her hair look perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other daughter has very thick hair that is straight as a board, even the hair itself is very thick.  It&#x27;s also very hard to dry her hair, period.  I use this on her to dry the ends and the hair towards the back of her head.  It doesn&#x27;t create the bob haircut like it does for finer hair - I would need a curling iron to do that for her thick, thick hair.  However, it does work in drying the parts I can&#x27;t ever seem to get with a traditional dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotation works clockwise and counter-clockwise.  It has a warm setting, a hot setting, and a cool setting.  It rotates best on the warmest (hot/high) setting.  Rotates slower on the warm/low setting.  The reason I took off a star was that it will not rotate in the cool setting.  Why???  The best way to set hair, as I believed, was to heat it, and then cool it off fast to set the curl.  Maybe I&#x27;m wrong.  I just don&#x27;t understand why it wouldn&#x27;t rotate in the cool setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is exactly what I needed and am happy I got it.  I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> The price went down $10 the week after I bought it.  I was not happy.  The dryer works ok.</li>
    <li> Decent product.  I absolutely love the rotating brush hair dryer/stylers.  They have transformed my hair. I used to have to go to a stylist to get a finished look because my hair is thick and long.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands.  I used this one for the first time today.  I bought it because it had a smaller brush then my other one and I wanted one for traveling.  I have another brand and found that I have has a more powerful motor then this one.  I have long thick hair and this product cannot easily make it&#x27;s way through the entire length of my hair.  It is good for finishing up the styling process if you have thicker hair but not as a primary hair dryer.</li>
    <li> The Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Styler is a hair dryer, brush, and styler all in one.  It has both a high and low setting, as well as a cool setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes it so different from a regular dryer is that has a soft bristled, rotating brush, and the heat blows out of the brush.  The brush can be rotated in either direction and is easily controlled, though it does not work on the cool setting.  In addition, the dryer can be used without spinning the brush, using the brush as one would normally do when styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair, and yet the spinning brush worked just fine without tangling.  I found that my hair appeared smooth and shiny after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other good features include the sideways plug, always a treasure to find when one is fitting many appliances into a surge protector. Also, the brush comes with a plastic protector cap, to keep the brush clean, which is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a unique product, which I enjoy using.  I did find it to be heavy and unwieldy, though, and honestly frightening until I knew exactly how to use it.  These points aren&#x27;t enough to outweigh the positive though, and I feel it is a five star appliance.</li>
    <li> It is not as I expected. The brush dies not heat properly and rotation seems also not to be working as it should.</li>
    <li> I like the styler but it would not be good for long hair.</li>
    <li> Drys your hair while it styles, but it takes time.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and it is amazing. The brush is not heavy and it is really practical.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t rate. It&#x27;s a great hot air dryer, it&#x27;s just that I need the barrel to be smaller. Like maybe 1/2 to 3/4.</li>
    <li> The bristles were falling out of this spin brush before I could get it out of the packaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going ahead with a 5-star review even though I really do need to get the hang of this styler. It&#x27;s amazing how quickly it grabs and rolls up hair! I was trying to dry/style like the demo video, and I guess my hair isn&#x27;t long enough to style the way it&#x27;s done in the video. I got the smaller of the two sizes and it&#x27;s still a large tool to work with, but the bristles are nice and soft and go through my hair nicely. I have an older styler that is hot metal and hard spikes, and this is so much nicer to my head and hair than that old thing.</li>
    <li> i love it but some of the bristles are coming out and others are mashing down.  it goes easily through my med. short hair, never gets tangled. its a great product</li>
    <li> i have had one for 4 years, it doesnt rotate well anymore so i will be buying a new one.  i have shoulder length, thick hair, it does an excellent job of styling my hair.  but,  i dry my hair with a hair dry until it is just damp before i use it.  i have had good luck with it, but did not clean the filter as i should have, thus, the brush barely  rotates now.</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair drying brushes for my long hair. This Conair Infiniti pro is unique in that it has a rotating brush. The brush can spin in either direction depending on the way you want to curl it. Remembering which direction you want to go takes some getting used to. On standard curling brushes, muscle memory takes any thinking out of which direction I want the brush to turn. It&#x27;s fun at first, but for me, using the buttons and rotating head has been more of a hassle. My hair kept getting tangled in it and I&#x27;m just not proficient with power tools in general. I don&#x27;t know when to release the spin and I want to see it go and go and go. The size and weight of the tool is fine. It&#x27;s not any heavier than the others I have tried. I dislike the mess I have to clean up after as it has lost many bristles. I still prefer my John Freida styling brush the best. I have abused that thing and it&#x27;s still kicking.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve become the resident Amazon hair apparatus reviewer, and truly, there are no Steve Jobs in the hair apparatus trade. It doesn&#x27;t seem like much thought or testing goes into any of these products. They just keep churning out different variations. Like why would you make the roller detachable? And why would you make it short and fat? Why not longer and fat? If you are drying your own hair, you don&#x27;t have time in your life to hold one thin strand at a time and keeping going over it until it&#x27;s dry. At a salon, when you&#x27;re reading a magazine and paying a stylist $60 to style your hair, sure, let her him or her spend 45 minutes pulling and rolling it one strand, one layer at a time, but at home? No. I have another wand which is twice as long and not as fat, and more like a piece of spiky plastic than a brush, but it serves the same purpose and does it faster because it pulls more hair. Also, the handle is pretty chunky on this and not comfortable to hold. So in conclusion, why would anyone need this when there are better, similar products on the market? Where is my Apple styler?</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it, it is too confusing to me and I&#x27;m old and don&#x27;t want to mess with it!</li>
    <li> Say goodbye to curly, frizzy hair with this hot air brush!! Love love love it! P.S: If you are looking for sleek straight hair, this is not for you. This just makes frizzy hair manageable while giving it a little volume (which a straightener doesn&#x27;t). I love how my hair looks after i style it with the Conair Infiniti Pro Styler.</li>
    <li> Recently cut my hair from below shoulders to a bob style and was having a horrible time taming my very fine short hair.  This 1.5&amp;#34; Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Rotating Styler arrived mid-day.  I immediately washed my hair and wrapped it in a towel for about five minutes and started drying.  Six minutes later my hair had lift, was smooth and perfect!  I was concerned about the size of the barrel, but anything smaller for my hair would have been &#x27;old lady&#x27; looking. Highly recommend this.  Happy Happy</li>
    <li> My hair gets stuck in it. I am disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is in a medium bob. After getting this I wished I&#x27;d bought the 1 1/2&amp;#34; brush head instead of the 2&amp;#34;. It would also have been nice if I could have interchanged the two sizes without having to buy an entirely different brush to get the correct size or even to use the larger size on top and the smaller size on my bottom layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I have used a round brush and blow dryer for years and I still think I can get my hair better if I do it manually myself. This is pretty good for my bangs especially if I just want to do them and not shampoo my entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s pretty easy to work and handle. I don&#x27;t find it overly heavy or difficult to use. Just takes a little getting used to but nothing that I&#x27;d complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying the smaller size though. I&#x27;ll just use my smaller brush to do it myself as I always have.</li>
    <li> extremely happy with it</li>
    <li> Not satisfied. I have frizzy dry hair and this product does not give me the result I was expecting. Maybe because the heat is not enough high to give me that professional blow out I was looking for. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> After watching a demo of this thing on youtube, I had to have one. It seemed too good to be true. All I&#x27;ve ever wanted it to be able to blow dry with a round brush and not wind up with carpal tunnel and quivering trapezius muscles in my shoulder region. I just don&#x27;t have the patience for it. My fine straight hair is usually cut into a chin length bob for this reason. Styling long hair seems to be a full time job and I already have one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I said, I got me one of these things and I am here to say it is the Beginning and the End of hair styling tools. Minimal effort for maximum results. You barely have to do anything. Just hold the thing in the general direction of your hair and it does the rest. Not only does it make the hair behave like it just returned from an extended stay at West Point, but it makes it SUPERSHINY too. And the way the hair MOVES--it&#x27;s just indescribable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered that if you pair it with mousse, like put the mousse on your wet hair and then use the Tool, it gets even better. The results last several days. Like, I WAKE UP WITH PERFECT HAIR. No exaggeration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s my two cents, but keep in mind my hair is fine and straight. The bristles on this thing are a bit soft. Which is ideal for me, but if your hair is very course I&#x27;m not sure it would work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to grow my hair long now that I have the Tool. Seriously.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier version of the the Conair and wanted to see what the improvements were on the newer version.  I had stopped using the earlier Conair because it took too long to dry hair.  The newer one does dry hair faster.  It still has the bulky handle though.  The first time I used this, my hair caught in the brush.  There is definitely an art to blow drying and styling.  Use small sections and don&#x27;t hold the brush too close to your scalp.  I was able to detangle my hair without too much fuss, but this happened way to often the first times I used it.  This dries and somewhat styles hair.  I say somewhat because I still had to use my straightener to get a really smooth look.  I have shoulder length hair. This product gave it some body at the crown and curled the ends.  If you don&#x27;t have problems with flyaway and frizzies this styler will probably be a great product but if you do, keep your straightener to do touch ups.</li>
    <li> I like the way this makes my hair look when I am finished, but it is not that easy to use.  I wish the rotating mechanism had a slower setting.  You barely touch it and zzzzip! your hair is wound up (sometimes a bit tangled).  If you work with it, you can get the hang of it, but the whole point of buying a  product like this is so that those of us that don&#x27;t have that enviable blow-styling gene can have an easier time styling our hair.  The hair-trigger (pardon the pun) on the rotator definitely needs to be slowed down a notch.  Still, like I said, my hair does look good when I&#x27;m finished.  I also wish I could find this in a smaller barrel and a travel version.  FYI, the styler I bought is 1.5 inches and my hair is medium thickness and longish.  Would not recommend this for the elderly or handicapped, as it is a challenge for even a slightly less coordinated stylist-- like myself.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have....easy to use and great results.</li>
    <li> This is way better than the instyler</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked better. This reminds me of a spinning rotating heated styler that I had years ago, then they stopped making them just as mine broke. I couldn&#x27;t replace it. I&#x27;ve tried several kinds, but they just didn&#x27;t work. This one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two buttons, one for use when you are doing your left side, and the other for the right side. You can flip the hair down, or up. Somehow just by accident, I made a cascade of curls. I loved it! I hope I can figure out how to do that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of frizzy hair, the spinning or rotating heated brush left my hair shiny and with lots of volume.  I usually have trouble with the back of my hair, but the styler made it easier. It also took MUCH less time than usual to dry my hair. I&#x27;m not sure why. It might have been because it was fun and the time just seemed to go by faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: The styler grabs hair firmly, which really helps with styling, then it releases it. Don&#x27;t be alarmed when it grabs your hair. Just give it a second and it will let go. The fact that it holds it firmly gives a smoother finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE FROM MY EXPERIENCE: Don&#x27;t put too much product in your hair to make it shine. (1) You don&#x27;t need it because the spinning action adds shine; (2) too much product causes it to take a long time to dry; (3) you don&#x27;t want to gunk up the brush. I ended up looking like I just got out of the shower or had over-conditioned my hair. I learned that I don&#x27;t need extra product, or at least not very much. A little goes a long way with this styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really considering ordering another one in case this one wears out and they decide to change this one or stop making it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for over a year.  I am very happy with it.  At first I had problems getting hair caught, etc.  This proved to be inexperience.  After about a week of figuring out the best technique to avoid getting hair caught and twisted I had no problems.  It&#x27;s easy to use on my chin length hair.  You should make sure that your hair has been towel dried thoroughly.  It gives my fine, thin hair boost I wouldn&#x27;t normally have.  Works even better if you use a little teeny bit of Volumizing mousse.  However, since it doesn&#x27;t get really hot-- too much mousse causes it to take longer to dry.</li>
    <li> Amazing! blowed out hair in under 20min</li>
    <li> This was bought for my wife and she loves it.</li>
