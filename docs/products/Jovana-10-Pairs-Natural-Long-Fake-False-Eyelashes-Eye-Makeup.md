<li> I used Duo lash glue to put them on and they stay put all day long!</li>

<li> I would of gave them 5 stars but they look a little plastic.</li>
<li> And are stiff</li>
<li> I found these fake lashes to be so long and ugly that I can only see them being used by a clown or a drag queen.</li>
<li> They look fake, like plastic fake.</li>
