      <li>And softer was better?</li>
      <li>It foamed up my cleaner into a think creamy lather and spread it around better than if I did it with just my hands.  </li>
      <li>I think they are perfect for morning face washes as all you are washing off is the oil that accumulated overnight or any product you left on like Laneige sleep masks.</li>

      <li>I used to use a wash cloth to clean my face</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
      <li>It can&#x27;t clean my face well.</li>
      <li>I opened the box and wanted to wash my face right then!</li>
      <li>Great brush for sensitive or normal skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing! It works well. It is a little too small for my hands but I&#x27;ll work with it. Trimming my nails down are so worth it for these facial brushses.</li>
    <li> These are much better and cheaper than the motorized kind.  The brushes are soft and clean thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Super soft and great little brushes. I think they are perfect for morning face washes as all you are washing off is the oil that accumulated overnight or any product you left on like Laneige sleep masks. Feels great with any kind of cleanser but I prefer foaming ones. I do full two minute face washes because it feels so great on my skin! Like I said, it&#x27;s super gentle and I think would be ideal for people with ultra sensitive skin and maybe bad acne. I can see it not aggravating cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that after wetting it to give it a light squeeze, otherwise you might have a little rivulet of water running down your neck. And lightly squeezing it with a towel after your&#x27;re done so it doesn&#x27;t accumulate mold.</li>
    <li> No instructions came with the box so I didn&#x27;t know which brush to use for the scrub and which to use second.  The bristles look the same so I decided to use the pink to scrub and the white to buff after rinsing.  How often do you use it?  Don&#x27;t know, no instructions.  Storage is a problem also because you need to rinse and hang up to dry.  Other than the shower, I don&#x27;t have a good place to hang them.  All &amp; all, it was a learning experience.</li>
    <li> It is so soft. They are a pleasure to use. Not sure if it&#x27;s helping my skin but I love the way it feels on my face. After about a month the brush part came out of the holder. This doesn&#x27;t affect use though since I was able to pop it back in.</li>
    <li> These made my skin break out....they are soft and comfortable to use. The product came wth no directions and that was not nice.</li>
    <li> The bristles are extremely too soft, to the point where I cannot properly rinse out the face wash and where it wouldn&#x27;t fully dry!:( I forgot to return this item, and left it hanging in my shower for a week, only to find out that it started growing mold! Yuck!</li>
    <li> This is the SOFTEST facial brush I have ever owned so if you enjoy a good scrub, I&#x27;m not sure you will like it. It cleans well if you make small circular motions and it is not damaging which is good. FYI: These brushes are sold EVERYWHERE online for as little as $3 &amp; $4 so don&#x27;t pay more than this for one. I was totally ripped off by the seller I made my purchase from.</li>
    <li> These brushes completely changed my skin! I rarely need foundation now.</li>
    <li> The bristles are soooo soft, I wondered how good of a job it&#x27;s actually going to do.  It foamed up my cleaner into a think creamy lather and spread it around better than if I did it with just my hands.  There was no scraping or brushing feeling.  It almost feels as soft as kitten fur, so I had no fear of even going around my eyes with it. When I rinsed my face, my skin felt gently exfoliated.  Maybe not as exfoliated as say using a scrub cleanser or traditional brush, but if it&#x27;s gentle enough to use everyday then you&#x27;d get the same exfoliation without being harsh. I found out about this brush type from Elaine Mokk&#x27;s youtube videos, because we both have acne prone skin.  This in combination with using gentle and effective Korean skin care regimen, my pores have gotten a little tighter, brighter compIexion, faded dark marks, and less breakouts while keeping my skin hydrated and smooth.  I&#x27;m giving the second brush away to a friend as a gift.</li>
    <li> These little facial brushes just arrived. They are the softest I&#x27;ve found in my year long search. Not sure about performance. They are for my kiddos delicate skin. I wanted to find a way to encourage them to start to take good care of their skin now before puberty hits big time. They LOVE them.</li>
    <li> Deeper cleansing with a soft touch. Get a lot of lather with these and have noticed my skin is smoother and softer since beginning to use. They are gentle enough that I use them daily morning and night and have not had any issue.</li>
    <li> I have only ever used the face brushes from the Body Shop.  This doesn&#x27;t even compare.  It does take a little while to get used to... And I keep having to check to make sure it&#x27;s sudsing... But it is.. And it feels so nice on my face.  Not sure I&#x27;ll buy anything else.</li>
    <li> Great brush for sensitive or normal skin. It creates an abundance of foaming action, which is how face wash is activated. Also, the brush is very gentle. No pulling on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.Skin definitely feels softer!</li>
    <li> I had a face wash brush from shiseido that I used for twenty years which I love, but I needed an extra one for my travel bag so I bought this. I actually like this brush so much better than my old shiseido brush! Not only is it more economical, but the bristles themselves are super soft. The problem with most face brushes is that they are too abrasive, which can cause micro tears on your skin, leaving your face susceptible to bacteria. I once used a harsh brush and had horrible acne as a result when my face normally does not break out. These brushes, which you get for cheaper than the price of one of most brushes, get your face deep clean without the abrasion. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how soft these brushes are, I have only used about a month or so but they are holding up well. Easy to clean but you do need to hang them to dry fully. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Fits in the palm of your hand and smoothly spreads cleanser.  I like using it and my face felt cleaner but not rough</li>
    <li> Very soft, It washed my face clean and bright and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love the facial skin care brush from BMC! So soft and not irritating on my sensitive skin. Just make sure to hang to dry in a well ventilated area.</li>
    <li> I love this brush it is soooo soft! I like using for washing my face with soap and removing masks, it feels so nice and soft. I feel as if my skin feels smoother than it did before.</li>
    <li> Honestly Didn&#x27;t Work For me; my skin broke out after using it. My skin may have broken out because of the bristle material simply because I know how to properly exfoliate (gentle circular motion). I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;ll continue to find the right product for &amp;#34;ME&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> enjoying my clean face.</li>
    <li> Got these to do daily soft exfoliation. Didn&#x27;t want something harsh that might break blood vessels in the face. These are super soft and I use one everyday.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too soft and too thick.  Was not what I was wanting.Doesn&#x27;t clean good enough because it&#x27;s to soft.</li>
    <li> Part of this was a gift.</li>
    <li> Now who would get this excited about washing your face.  I can tell you I stand in the shower and wash my face over and over with this &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34;.  It is like silk on your skin.  I can not believe how soft it is!!  I have one in the shower and one on my bathroom sink and will NEVER use anything else.  Worth every penny.  Forget those harsh, expensive rotating brushes.</li>
    <li> Wow. Just wow. I could not be happier or more impressed. The sre is so unbelievably soft. I will defiantly order these again.</li>
    <li> This brush is easy to use with any cleanser. It rinses quickly, and if hung to air-dry, is ready to use within a few hours.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush!!  I have extremely sensitive skin so when I say it&#x27;s ultra soft you can count on it.  I only need I pump of my organic foam soap and was able to clean my face with no irritation.  I highly recommend this brush!!!  I have mature skin (over 40) and my daughter is under 20 and we both found this to be a gentle but effective brush for face cleaning.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my fianc&amp;eacute;e and I, we both recently started washing our faces with coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;Our faces have cleared up a lot since we started washing with coconut oil, but we were lacking an exfoliation, I needed something gentle for my sensitive skin, my fianc&amp;eacute;e needed something effective for his large pores.&lt;br /&gt;Well these little things are perfect for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable and easy to use, very gentle and works great, perfect for oil cleansing as it adds that cleaning boost of an extremely gentle exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These feel like velvet there are so many soft bristles packed into the brush.  My face feels very clean without harsh abrasives.</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes and you get TWO! How great! I have been using these for awhile now and love them. Make sure to ring them out after you use them and place upside down on a cloth or hang to dry! Great for getting dirt and make-up off my skin. Super soft!</li>
    <li> at first i was confused, but they really get the makeup and dead skin off without being too abrasive.  i use this at nite and my clarisonic in the morning</li>
    <li> How come nobody told me about facial brushes before? My skin has never looked better. They are super soft, the bristles are so fine that you can&#x27;t even feel individual bristles and that makes it a pleasure to use. All the yuckiness of the day gets swept away and leaves your skin baby soft. Pores get cleaned out and blackheads disappear.</li>
    <li> They clean my face really well! My pores are smaller after only a few uses! Only thing is you really do need to hang them in a well ventilated area. If not, the next time you go and try to use them, they will still be moist.</li>
    <li> I used to use a wash cloth to clean my face but since I&#x27;m battling with acne I need a deeper GENTLE clean which is so important because when I would scrub my face really hard it would leave me with tons of acne scars and irritation, its not supposed to feel rough its for your face. I apply my facial cleanser to my face then I use the brush to basically buff the cleanser into my skin. I love these brushes anybody who is curious about these brushes should try them you can&#x27;t lose.</li>
    <li> They are soft and pleasant to use but perhaps just a bit too small for my large hands to grab hold.  For the price, however, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This brush is much softer then other brushes I have used and it works better without leaving red marks on my face. The red marks with the other brushes went away quickly but this brush does a better job of cleaning pores. It leaves your face smooth and pretty.</li>
    <li> Good brush give a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for a few months but find the bristles to be much too soft for my skin.  I had a facial and the esthetician recommended I get a brush to help with clogged pores, so it&#x27;s obviously isn&#x27;t working. I would recommend only if you have very sensitive or fragile skin.</li>
    <li> I received these little jewels a few days ago and WOW is all I can say.  They make my skin feel and look wonderful and considering I am a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; female that is a huge complement.  I use it in once a day in the shower with a skin cleanser and it has made my skin glow even without makeup.  The brush is so soft and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have looked at a variety of brushes and finally decided to try these.  Great price!  Great product!  And the delivery was speedy as always from Amazon.  I recently became a Prime Member and it is so worth the extra money to get 2 day delivery along with all the other benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking at other reviews as to the best way to clean the brushes.  For starters I do wash it after every use and air dry it between uses so that it doesn&#x27;t become a breeding ground for mold or bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 5 starts, but would give it more if I could.  Thank you again Amazon.</li>
    <li> The quality of these face &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; brushes is good.  The brissles are verrrry thin, and all together they are like you see in the photo.  They feel verrrrrry soft on your face.  And they rinse outnicely.  The little hanging string is a nice feature too, because you can hang them to dry.  I have one in the shower and one near the bathroom sink.  It&#x27;s nice to have two so you don&#x27;t have to carry one in and out of the shower/bath etc.  They are even soft enough to gently wash your eyelids and all around your eyes.  Wonderfully sofffft.  The plastic base is sturdy and ergonomically comfy.  Love em.  Highly recommend these- especially if you have thin or sensitive skin.  And even if you have robust skin... the brissles are so thin that they do a good job of cleaning out your pores.</li>
    <li> Great little size but the brush is too soft.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my teenagers (boy and girl).  They both love them and use them every single day.  The brush stays really soft and does not mat down.</li>
    <li> These facial brushes are extremely soft....not sure how pore cleansing they actually are, but for somebody like me who doesn&#x27;t like harsh exfoliating scrubbing on my face, they work just fine. My face still feels clean but not raw and scratched. I also use this on my neck to cleanse gently.</li>
    <li> These are marvelous tools for keeping the face clean.  The brushes are super, super soft and feel wonderful on the skin.  I enjoy using them every morning and now find I&#x27;m cleaning longer because of the softness.  My skin is glowing healthy and breakouts down to almost nil.</li>
    <li> I have big pores and oily skin. Bad combo. I wish I had come across a facial brush like this years ago because it does an excellent job cleaning my skin/face. Facial soaps, scrubs, astringents, etc, they just clean the surface but can&#x27;t get deep into those pores. This brush with it&#x27;s teeny tiny bristles can get down into those pores. My skin is smoother and glowing. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the brush unit fell out of it holder on the 2nd time I used it. I just pushed it back in and luckily it&#x27;s snug enough that I don&#x27;t have to use any glue.</li>
    <li> Was surprised at how soft yet effective this little brush is. Delightful.</li>
    <li> The bristles are so soft the brush is essentially useless. This brush deserves no stars. Only product that I have purchased from Amazon in which I absolutely hate.</li>
    <li> very good. very soft love it would buy again. Have bought for my girlfriend and sister in law. they both love it just as much as i do.</li>
    <li> I guess these exfoliate, but as far as deep pore cleansing, I can&#x27;t say of they work. Very soft though and very gentle.</li>
    <li> Looked and looked for facial brushes, and decided to give this one a try from all the reviews! And I have to say I will definitely be ordering another set soon. I&#x27;m on my second brush since I use it pretty much 2x a day for my morning wash and evening washing of my face! My skin is so much softer and brighter, and love that feeling that I&#x27;m able to get all of my makeup off my face, especially before bedtime! Originally I was going to buy an electric facial brush, but opt for this and I am happy with it!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, these are SO incredibly soft. I have acne prone skin, so making sure I get a gentle brush for my face is super important. The fact that I can get two brushes for a pretty cheap price is really awesome, and the effect on my face is a soft, baby smooth complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the hangers on the ends of these, so I can hang it upside down in the shower after using it and mold won&#x27;t grow on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love these and will purchase more as I need them.</li>
    <li> Should have read reviews, too soft.  Oh well like and learn.</li>
    <li> After reading great reviews, I was really excited to purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the item, it was exactly the way I expected from all the positive reviews that it received.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are really soft. Additionally, before buying this item, I checked to see if it was anti-bacterial bristles and it was stated that it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However after I started using this brush, I started breaking out even more! I was really disappointed with it. So instead of using it on my face, I use it for my body now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a two star instead of a one star because I actually love the softness of this brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and gentle for the face. They have a shape and size that fits ergonomically in your hand. This is the first facial exfoliating brush that I&#x27;ve bought and I have been using it everyday since it arrived! The price is great and you get two brushes instead of one. I gave the other one to my mom. I would get this product again, they also make great gifts!</li>
    <li> it is very soft!! i love this product sooo much!! it just feels like you r using your hand!! and the product does the cleaning very well!!! XD</li>
    <li> Wife broke out after using in blemishes. Bought a much cheaper brush at Ross with better results.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using the little face brush and it does a great job of manually cleaning my pores with a foam cleanser. Super soft bristles. I wish it had a bulb handle because it is a little bit odd to manipulate and rub against the face. No regrets. Tip: To get this type of brush to fully dry by the next day, shake off the water really hard several times after you rinse it.</li>
    <li> Soft and works very well.  durable and the price is great.  I use it for travel when I can&#x27;t bring a clarisonic.</li>
    <li> It can&#x27;t clean my face well. It doesn&#x27;t attach the face wash cream. when I use it the massage my face, it brushes the face wash away from my face</li>
    <li> They are so soft! I am in love, I was fully expecting these to be cheap brushes and fall apart. The minute I got them I opened the box and wanted to wash my face right then! If these were bigger I would use them all over, it lathers up just enough!  great. I plan on buying more for holiday gifts!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Cleans deeply and gently.  Excellent value!</li>
    <li> Works beautifully and does exactly what a $40 brush at the make up counter at Macy&#x27;s does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry but it is just to soft, it&#x27;s like using my fingers. I was looking for something with a little more exfoliating ability. I do use them on occasion. They are cute and in expensive. If you want gentle cleansing then these are for you.</li>
    <li> Super soft maybe a little to soft lol... I bought this due to the fact it was soft.. I struggle with acne and didn&#x27;t want to irritate my skin with something to rough.. this is perfect.. it takes half a day to dry so I would recommend to use once a day..  it does dry fast when you hang it up.. I would say hang it up some where outside the bathroom. You will get best result that way... I hope I helped... I havent broken out since using so so far so good..</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and bought this pore cleanser in particular since it said it had very soft bristles.  They feel like fur.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> Really like these brushes. Very soft.</li>
    <li> very soft and great for facial cleansing, lasts a while</li>
    <li> Contrary to popular belief, exfoliation does NOT require rough abrasives. In fact, physical exfoliation that is too harsh, as it usually is, it will damage your skin over time and is not half as helpful as most of us believe. And in our noble quest for clear skin, we often over-exfoliate by scrubbing too hard with bristles, sponges, silicone pads, and all the little beads or shell bits in exfoliating face wash. I limit my use of my favourite apricot scrub for just this reason-- I will generally scratch up my face in the hopes of clearing it up, to no avail. And while those exfoliators can be useful against weird scaly winter flaky skin... I have never really seen special results from them, particularly in terms of my blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;No wash or scrubbing tool has ever removed my blackheads, the best I can hope for is that they don&#x27;t get worse. Masques and pore strips weren&#x27;t exactly miracle workers in that department either. Recent stress and nervous face-touching habits had me breaking out all over my T-zone. It was awful. And my blackheads were so bad that they could be clearly seen from several feet away. I was starting to get itchy fingers trying to resist uselessly picking at them and making everything worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I order these. The first day of using one of these brushes with a (non-foaming, non-exfoliating) cleanser that I have been using for 4-5 years, my blackheads were half the size they were before washing. Day two, and most of them are completely gone! I was going to wait to review but I am so excited that I&#x27;m already planning on gushing about them to my whole family (all of whom have ALWAYS had a nose full of blackheads, from adolescence to old age).&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the brush is very soft, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not working. Your dead layer of skin is dead. It does not need sandpaper to come off of your face. This brush is plenty powerful enough to do that, and doesn&#x27;t leave micro-cuts all over. The soft bristles are so densely packed that I wasworried about debris getting caught deep inside, but they are actually so close that nothing gets very far into the brush.. And shockingly, regardless of this, the brush is dry in a few hours (squeeze excess water out after rinsing it).&lt;br /&gt;It is so gentle that washing with it basically feels like rubbing a piece of silk all over your face. You can use it to wash over your whole face without irritating sensitive skin around your eyes, which makes it a real wonder against eye makeup that is a pain to remove. Between the lather it easily creates and the teeny tiny bristles that can get all kind of places your fingers and normal size bristles simply can&#x27;t reach, my pores are looking better than they have since I hit puberty a dozen years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so in love, I would hunt down these brushes to department stores at the end of the earth! Thank goodness they&#x27;re right here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Makes my face fell smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> Love this pore brush! The material is soft and wont hurt our skin. You will love it too. Thank you Amazon for carrying this seller&#x27;s product. Cheers</li>
    <li> What the hell man..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dis does nothing to you skin good. Don&#x27;t buy it..</li>
    <li> I know you&#x27;re supposed to not scrub your face but these brushes are just too soft.  It feels like you&#x27;re not doing anything at all to your face.</li>
    <li> I was not sure if these would work well to clean my face because of how soft they are but they are great.</li>
    <li> I tried it, and i love it.  When i first tried it w/ my regular facial cleanser, it seemed too soft to be of any real use in cleaning my face of dirt, makeup and oil.  But i continued using it and then started noticing after the 2nd week that i could feel the individual bristles as i moved the brush over my face.  The bristles felt like super sharp micro-needles that didn&#x27;t abrade the skin or hurt in any way b/c my face wasn&#x27;t red or irritated.  Then i started noticing that the pores on my nose were very clean, which hasn&#x27;t happened before with other brushes.  It also after 4 wks of use hasn&#x27;t seem to have worn down in any way, unlike other facial brushes i&#x27;ve used.  Just be sure to squeeze as much water out of it as possible after giving it several good shakes.</li>
    <li> I prefer a natural sponge (from the sea!) which seems to clean the pores on my face better than a facial brush.</li>
    <li> Almost too soft. I like a nice soft face brush, but this one was a bit too soft. I am using it, but it doesn&#x27;t feel even the slightest bit exfoliating. Very high quality feel though!</li>
    <li> As others said these are very soft. But they are also very effective without being harsh at all. I love them.</li>
    <li> This cleans my face very well with no scratching, but may be a little too soft for what I wanted. After a couple of weeks of using it, I don&#x27;t feel as if it is  exfoliating at all.</li>
    <li> Ordered these and am so thankful they don&#x27;t scratch my skin like previous ones. One for travel and one for home!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love these brushes!! The box comes with two of these little hand held brushes. After a week of using this with my usual Cetaphil daily face wash, my skin has become softer, and my complexion has cleared and just improved in general! The brush is so soft that it exfoliates but doesn&#x27;t irritate. Definitely will be gift these this Christmas!!</li>
    <li> I wanted something that would help me get a good lather without being painful on my face. This did just that! The brush is super soft and just what I was wanting! Kept one and gave other as a gift. :)</li>
    <li> product is well made, but the bristles are TOO soft to use as a facial scrub, so i&#x27;ll use them for theatrical powder makeup application. Nice grip and good price for what you get.</li>
    <li> Awesome service! The item was as described. Extremely soft bristles, very gentle on the skin! Have an extra one for travel or overnighters.Thanks!</li>
    <li> These are amazing brushes.  It is a brush, a very lush brush; but it is so very soft.  It&#x27;s hard to think of a brush as soft but it is!  It feels so good on your skin.  It deep cleans, but is very gentle!  As long as they make these brushes, I WILL buy them</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure what to expect.. a brush for my FACE? And softer was better? You mean I didnt have to scrub with sand anymore? WHAT? And sure enough, these brushes arrived, and I started using them. After a week, already noticeably clearer, brighter skin. And two in a box means ones for every day and one for travel, so you never have to be without. I feel like ordering another box, just to keep them in stock... you know, just in case they are discontinued and I must start the hunt all over again. I am even considering getting them as gifts for my friends!</li>
    <li> The brushes feel nice but a little too soft for exfoliation purposes.</li>
    <li> Product is fine, but compare to what I bought from local store for $3, really not much difference.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed cause I paid extra and thought it&#x27;ll be a lot better.</li>
    <li> I did everything to keep these clean and all they did was smell moldy, even after the second use. The bristles are very soft, but I didn&#x27;t feel it was doing anything for my face. A waste of my money.</li>
    <li> So soft.  Perfect for your face.  Just bought them for a second time because I can&#x27;t find better anywhere else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really, really soft.......I actually wash my face more often just to use this brush.  Does everything described.  Use one at the bathroom sink and one in the  shower.  I&#x27;m ordering another set for travel purposes.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> These little brushes are incredible!  I use them with my facial cleanser in the shower, and they provide thorough, but gentle, cleaning.  Rinsing them clean is really easy, and they hold up really well.  As I&#x27;m writing this review, I&#x27;ve had them for a full year.  Shortly after I purchased them, the &amp;#34;brush bundle&amp;#34; fell out of one of the brushes.  I just glued it back it, and it&#x27;s been fine ever since.  If you like gentle exfoliation, you&#x27;ll love these!</li>
    <li> I had ben looking for a new facial brush for several months but was unable to find what I want until I look on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly what I wanted.  I received the package in  a very short time and am completely satisfied with the product and the service.</li>
    <li> Some other people commented that they felt the brushes were too soft.  Well, actually that is the point.  Most people scrub their face with too much pressure, with face scrubs that are too too too abrasive (yes, I wrote 3 too&#x27;s intentionally), and coarse cleansing brushes/pads.  All of this leaves very fine, nearly microscopic tears in the skin.  we don&#x27;t want that!  I&#x27;ll never use anything else again.  These brushes feel Soooo Good on my skin</li>
    <li> When I touched this with my fingers I thought &amp;#34;Oh my gosh!  This is going to be heavenly on my face it&#x27;s so soft!&amp;#34;. Yes, the bristles are extremely soft.  But my experience with it was that I felt it didn&#x27;t really clean my face well.  I put the cleanser on the brush and massaged all over my face but it&#x27;s so soft that the bristles just mash down.  My granddaughter likes hers... I guess I&#x27;ll give her mine.  She&#x27;s only 12.</li>
    <li> I like it , but  a somewhat longer handle probably will be an improvement, making it easier to handle.</li>
    <li> Too soft. I purchased these to aid in exfoliation. Not good for that purpose.</li>
    <li> these are good. they are what they say they are, but i&#x27;m not totally convinced that using these is anywhere near as effective as using an electronic device.</li>
    <li> made my skin worst so I stopped using it after my second use. I prefer clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. Feel like high quality facial brushes. Perfect size for traveling. Will purchase again.</li>
