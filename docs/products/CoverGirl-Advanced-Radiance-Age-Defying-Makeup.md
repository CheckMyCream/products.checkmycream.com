      <li>I love love this foundation!</li>
      <li>my skin is :).</li>
      <li>I love this, it keeps my face moistured &amp; covers well</li>
      <li>Such a great product!</li>
      <li>Covergirl foundations are my favorite, but this is my favorite of Covergirl.</li>
      <li>so no worries about the product traveling all over the place, love it :)</li>
      <li>I love this product and always get complements whenever I use it.</li>
      <li>I love this makeup.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many foundations.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It does stay on for most of the day, though.  </li>
      <li>I am really enjoying using this easy to use pump makeup.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a red head and very fair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;For the first time ever, complete strangers come up to me, just to tell me how amazing and gorgeous</li>
      <li>The fine lines are hidden away, as promised, and picture perfect flawless everyday, every time.</li>
      <li>All in all, very satisfied, will use often and highly</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and clean after.</li>
      <li>The makeup smells great, which is always a bonus for a facial product.  </li>
      <li>Too Light for my face.</li>
      <li>Is smooth and silky feeling.</li>
      <li>Light and non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>Great price on a product I daily wear.</li>
      <li>I also use a SPF moisturizer underneath and a light brush of power to set the foundation in place--remember, be it CG or otherwise, to let your foundation and concealer set before dusting on powder or your brush will swipe it all off.</li>
      <li>and I feel so pretty and confident when wearing it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for full, yet light weight coverage.  </li>
      <li>It just feels clean and covers evenly.</li>
      <li>It feels clean and doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
      <li>I pretty much tried every liquid foundation that was available and while most did a good job, I found the same issues as I&#x27;ve had when using any type of makeup magic.</li>
      <li>Even though I have supplemented with much more expensive makeup, when it comes to Cover Girl Advanced Age Defying Makeup stands with the best.</li>
      <li>My new favorite foundation.</li>
      <li>In general, I have good skin that tends to get a bit oily but as I get older, my skin lacks that youthful, even glow.</li>
      <li>couple of months ago, I came across CG&#x27;s Advanced Radiance without having heard much about it.</li>
      <li>I have dark circles and can never find a good cover stick, creme, pencil...</li>
      <li>It gives great coverage (was able to hide all my acne scars) but sadly doesnt work well with my acne problems.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it necessarily for the &#x27;age-defying&#x27; element of the product (though that sure doesn&#x27;t hurt, or the 10 SPF) but because it was at the right price, it was one I had yet to test</li>
      <li>It has medium coverage and doesn&#x27;t get shiny as fast as the Covergirl Natureluxe, which is my second favorite.</li>
      <li>I chose Creamy Natural shade and it ended up being a shade too dark for my fair</li>
      <li>After trying different foundations over many years, I&#x27;ve been using this one for 2 years, and I have no intention of switching to a new one any time soon.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t like the heaviness as much</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for years mainly because the color&lt;br /&gt;matches</li>
      <li>I bought Classic Beige, paid $8.94 plus tax at WalMart today.</li>
      <li>Says it glides on without feeling heavy and gives her a smoother, more polished look.</li>
      <li>but everyone thinks I&#x27;m in my early twenties!</li>
      <li>Great, just a little darker than my usual stuff.</li>
      <li>So I switched to liquid and while liquid foundation does keep my skin hydrated, some of the brands I&#x27;d tried were too oily, easily rubbed off on everything or felt as heavy as powder makeup.</li>
      <li>I love this makeup base, it has an amazing staying power, no need to reapply, it&#x27;s light enough to wear in the summer time and it stays on my face all day and it doesn&#x27;t crease on small lines or wrinkles, it has a mild non greasy Olay mositurizer with spf15</li>
      <li>Bought this makeup for my grandma, who is 78 years young.</li>
      <li>In fact, I want to use this product everyday because it&#x27;s so light</li>
      <li>It covers pretty well, not total cover up, but definitely covers.  </li>
      <li>Revlon PhotoReady Makeup, Nude 004, 1-Fluid Ounce]], which was light and non-greasy but matte, flat on my on my skin and hardly made me &#x27;photo ready&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought a new tube &amp; it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
      <li>I bought a new tube &amp; it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
      <li>I have actually received compliments saying how healthy my skin looks lately.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d never had major issues with CG products.</li>
      <li>There is a slight fragrance, but it&#x27;s not bad and if you&#x27;re off one shade, up or down, it still blends seamlessly to your natural skin tone while providing medium coverage and an even tone to your skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few months and SOOOO glad I didn&#x27;t turn my back on this product.</li>

<li> Just need the tiniest amounts, partial pumps or careful pumps.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> , I don&#x27;t have bad skin to begin with (not as bad in years past), pretty even tone all around and a facial routine to keep my skin as blemish free as possible, but the Buff Beige adds a hint of dimension, depth and that Unexplainable Something that enhances all my good features and highlights none of the bad.</li>
<li> However, without something on my face, I appear older, washed out and people were always commenting that I looked tired...</li>

<li> Worse, I was constantly breaking out from the various chemicals--something I learned when I moved to the desert.</li>
<li> She was unhappy with the (much more expensive) foundation that I had recently bought for her, so</li>
<li> Too heavy, oily, the shade was off, it felt awful on my skin, I broke out, it made fine lines even bigger</li>
<li> This is probably in my head, but I swear my skin FEELs smoother and looks a bit brighter, just from using it everyday.</li>
<li> /&gt;Years ago, I went through a phase of mineral makeup, cheap and expensive brands, which was neither here nor there, and then powder, which compacted in the faint lines around my eyes and mouth, and depending on the formula, either dried out my skin or looked like I was wearing an oily plastic mask.</li>
<li> It is not too heavy, I use a concealer&lt;br /&gt;underneath</li>
<li> It covers well and doesn&#x27;t seem to make my face as oily as others do after a few hours.</li>
<li> and it isn&#x27;t messy.  </li>
<li> It does not feel heavy or greasy.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m trying other brands and products to figure it out :(.d, will use often and highly</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also a pump, so you don&#x27;t waste a drop!</li>
<li> Also, if Olay is part of the ingredients, hard to go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This makeup is getting so hard to find...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties</li>
<li> It does go on thickly</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not as bad as when I&#x27;ve used other foundations.&lt;br</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup if I can help it because a lot of the makeups out there are chemically heavy, my skin reacts badly and it&#x27;s always so difficult to match my skin type/color.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m trying other brands and products to figure it out :(.</li>

    <li> I love this makeup.  The color blends great with my skin, and it has wonderful coverage.  The makeup smells great, which is always a bonus for a facial product.  After trying different foundations over many years, I&#x27;ve been using this one for 2 years, and I have no intention of switching to a new one any time soon.</li>
    <li> I have tried many foundations.  Covergirl foundations are my favorite, but this is my favorite of Covergirl. It has medium coverage and doesn&#x27;t get shiny as fast as the Covergirl Natureluxe, which is my second favorite. I use it with Covergirl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Concealer and Covergirl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Corrector.</li>
    <li> Great price on a product I daily wear.</li>
    <li> Such a great product!</li>
    <li> Great, just a little darker than my usual stuff.</li>
    <li> Even though I have supplemented with much more expensive makeup, when it comes to Cover Girl Advanced Age Defying Makeup stands with the best. It just feels clean and covers evenly. It does not feel heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> Bought this makeup for my grandma, who is 78 years young. She was unhappy with the (much more expensive) foundation that I had recently bought for her, so I thought I&#x27;d try this. She loves it. Says it glides on without feeling heavy and gives her a smoother, more polished look.</li>
    <li> Great Texture. I&#x27;m a olive color and chose Buff Beige. Too Light for my face.</li>
    <li> The price was over $10 at Amazon. I bought Classic Beige, paid $8.94 plus tax at WalMart today. Surely Amazon can do better on this price!  Joy O.</li>
    <li> I love love this foundation! It gives great coverage (was able to hide all my acne scars) but sadly doesnt work well with my acne problems. If you dont have oily skin i would suggest you give it a try!</li>
    <li> I love this makeup base, it has an amazing staying power, no need to reapply, it&#x27;s light enough to wear in the summer time and it stays on my face all day and it doesn&#x27;t crease on small lines or wrinkles, it has a mild non greasy Olay mositurizer with spf15 and again is not greasy so no worries about the product traveling all over the place, love it :)</li>
    <li> Light and non-greasy.  I feel like my skin can breathe.  It feels clean and doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
    <li> I like the colors offered, the plastic pump bottle, and the fact that it has SPF 15 protection.  A good bargain</li>
    <li> This makeup is getting so hard to find...thank goodness for Amazon and their auto ship program...I never have to search for it any longer!</li>
    <li> I keep returning to it even after trying other foundations. I&#x27;ve tried others just for a change, but really like this best. It covers well and doesn&#x27;t seem to make my face as oily as others do after a few hours.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;m a red head and very fair.  I love this product and always get complements whenever I use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years mainly because the color&lt;br /&gt;matches my skin tone to perfection. It is not too heavy, I use a concealer&lt;br /&gt;underneath for the problem areas.</li>
    <li> My new favorite foundation.</li>
    <li> This has a nice dispenser so you get just what you need and it isn&#x27;t messy.  It does go on thickly and I recommend loose powder to soften the heaviness.  I chose Creamy Natural shade and it ended up being a shade too dark for my fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does stay on for most of the day, though.  I just don&#x27;t like the heaviness as much</li>
    <li> In general, I have good skin that tends to get a bit oily but as I get older, my skin lacks that youthful, even glow. I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup if I can help it because a lot of the makeups out there are chemically heavy, my skin reacts badly and it&#x27;s always so difficult to match my skin type/color. However, without something on my face, I appear older, washed out and people were always commenting that I looked tired...when I wasn&#x27;t at all. I&#x27;d been using [[ASIN:B0030HAE2Y Revlon PhotoReady Makeup, Nude 004, 1-Fluid Ounce]], which was light and non-greasy but matte, flat on my on my skin and hardly made me &#x27;photo ready&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, I went through a phase of mineral makeup, cheap and expensive brands, which was neither here nor there, and then powder, which compacted in the faint lines around my eyes and mouth, and depending on the formula, either dried out my skin or looked like I was wearing an oily plastic mask.

Too heavy, oily, the shade was off, it felt awful on my skin, I broke out, it made fine lines even bigger, it made my skin look plastic-y and unnatural, didn&#x27;t do anything at all, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago, I came across CG&#x27;s Advanced Radiance without having heard much about it. I didn&#x27;t buy it necessarily for the &#x27;age-defying&#x27; element of the product (though that sure doesn&#x27;t hurt, or the 10 SPF) but because it was at the right price, it was one I had yet to test and I&#x27;d never had major issues with CG products.

In fact, I want to use this product everyday because it&#x27;s so light and I feel so pretty and confident when wearing it. Plus, I don&#x27;t break out (!) and it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I&#x27;m wearing a mask. This is probably in my head, but I swear my skin FEELs smoother and looks a bit brighter, just from using it everyday. There is a slight fragrance, but it&#x27;s not bad and if you&#x27;re off one shade, up or down, it still blends seamlessly to your natural skin tone while providing medium coverage and an even tone to your skin. It&#x27;s also a pump, so you don&#x27;t waste a drop! I use a non-latex sponge to put it on and one squirt will cover your entire face and neck. I also use a SPF moisturizer underneath and a light brush of power to set the foundation in place--remember, be it CG or otherwise, to let your foundation and concealer set before dusting on powder or your brush will swipe it all off. While this foundation does make my face a bit shiny (I have somewhat oily skin anyways) it&#x27;s not as bad as when I&#x27;ve used other foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time ever, complete strangers come up to me, just to tell me how amazing and gorgeous my skin is :). I&#x27;m in my late twenties but everyone thinks I&#x27;m in my early twenties! Even my mom bought some. Mind you, I don&#x27;t have bad skin to begin with (not as bad in years past), pretty even tone all around and a facial routine to keep my skin as blemish free as possible, but the Buff Beige adds a hint of dimension, depth and that Unexplainable Something that enhances all my good features and highlights none of the bad. The fine lines are hidden away, as promised, and picture perfect flawless everyday, every time. The only downside is that they&#x27;re limited in color selection but I bought a shade lighter but I found that it blended in so well that I didn&#x27;t feel that I needed to buy a darker shade. All in all, very satisfied, will use often and highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6-13, 3 STARS: the formula is different and it&#x27;s noticeable. I bought a new tube &amp; it&#x27;s just not the same. I don&#x27;t know why but I&#x27;m trying other brands and products to figure it out :(.d, will use often and highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6-13, 3 STARS: the formula is different and it&#x27;s noticeable. I bought a new tube &amp; it&#x27;s just not the same. I don&#x27;t know why but I&#x27;m trying other brands and products to figure it out :(.</li>
    <li> Perfect coverage and color. Easy to apply and clean after.</li>
    <li> This make-up truly works.  It evens out my skin tone without looking like make-up is even on my face. I have actually received compliments saying how healthy my skin looks lately.  You cant beat that!</li>
    <li> I love this, it keeps my face moistured &amp; covers well</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying using this easy to use pump makeup.  It covers pretty well, not total cover up, but definitely covers.  Is smooth and silky feeling. Just need the tiniest amounts, partial pumps or careful pumps.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a BB in a tube, but this will be easier to use...&lt;br /&gt;I got 2 colors, one for fall and winter, one for spring and summer, or to mix!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for full, yet light weight coverage.  This is perfect.  I have dark circles and can never find a good cover stick, creme, pencil...you name it.  With this makeup, I also use it under my eyes too.  It works great and it&#x27;s saving me lots of money!  Highly recommend!</li>
