### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;People who give this product 5 stars comment on and grade the bottle more than the product itself!!!</li>
      <li>a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>after reading into this product, has great reviews.</li>
      <li>It would be really great if they could make it in foam form.</li>
      <li>THAT was the good news.</li>
      <li>Have been using it about a year now and see a great improvement in hair growth in areas that were the most effective.</li>
      <li>expect they will stop making nanoxidil once more people complain about it is uselessness!</li>
      <li>An amazingly over-blown, expensively-packaged, do-nothing set of products</li>
      <li>so to be honest</li>
      <li>A friend recommended the product to&lt;br /&gt;Me and liked it.</li>
      <li>(you would never know she had lost hair, her hair is full and beautiful).  </li>
      <li>In the areas that were thinning it has worked great, my hair has become much thicker!</li>
      <li>I originally tried ORIGINAL Spectral DNC and had great</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy since its worked so well in the front and hope for the best in the back!</li>
      <li>so it goes mostly on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I still think Biotin is what helped me most.  </li>
      <li>It feels like you have gel in your hair, and because of that it makes my scalp be more visible.</li>
      <li>Some are a bit thicker than others and some have a better spray head.</li>
      <li>It is not user-friendly, the pump gets more product ON your hair than on your scalp.  </li>
      <li>the Company who makes this stuff is very helpful when it came to asking which products work best for certain conditions.  </li>
      <li>However its been slow going with okay results in the areas that have lost the most hair and for the greatest amount of time.</li>
      <li>it has detailed information written on it</li>
      <li>just like it did before I started using the ORIGINAL Spectral DNC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>as well more the first ones I have tried,</li>
      <li>I will never have the full head of curls I had in my forties me</li>
      <li>It might be closer to a year before there&#x27;s a full a turnaround.</li>
      <li>but it is worth a try.  </li>
      <li>She suggested until then that it only be used at night even though the instructions say it must be used twice a day to be effective.</li>
      <li>If nothing else, so far I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve lost any more hair, but it will take months to really know if I&#x27;m going to regrow hair or not.  </li>
      <li>; I used it for three months exactly as instructed then stopped.</li>
      <li>and it works for the back and top.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like a funny sensation.</li>
      <li>I like how it pumps the liquid onto the exact area where you need it.  </li>
      <li>I have been pleased with the overall results.</li>
      <li>It certainly did not grow any hair.  </li>
      <li>, it is very greasy and sticky and leave the hair and scalp sticky.</li>
      <li>This stuff really worked for my boyfriend in conjunction with his use of the DS Labs Spectral F7 Efficacy Booster.  </li>
      <li>but I really can&#x27;t use it in the morning on days</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now and can see a real difference.  </li>
      <li>this looks very well manufactured and thought out.</li>
      <li>I work - it just looks like I didn&#x27;t really wash my hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I really can&#x27;t review on any type of hair growth (since this purchase I do see some thickness around my hairline).</li>
      <li>As all say, it has a really thick texture and it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
      <li>kind of hard to ensure this gets used twice a day, but am willing to give it 90 days.  </li>
      <li>They have some cool information on YouTube explaining the key ingredients and how this stuff works.</li>
      <li>I was told by the CS rep that the company was aware of both problems but it was not yet fixed.</li>
      <li>And using &amp;#34;7pumps twice daily&amp;#34; certainly ensures DSL Labs that you will be buying more soon, as 2 oz lasts barely a few weeks.</li>
      <li>you will find no information on it in the main website.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It seemed to be working for me where Rogaine wasn&#x27;t, but a year later I just don&#x27;t think it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>This product is a total  fake, it doesn&#x27;t look like the original, smell different and of course does not work, I was loosing more hair!!</li>
      <li>On a side note, in the past I have used the specific hair growth product detailed above (not the brown slime I received) and (in combination with the shampoo and conditioner) have been rather pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>the other regular spray works better, this one clogs the sprayer and</li>
      <li>Well rhf smell is stronger than the ones I have bought from Istanbul right after my hair transplant minor surgery, also it made my drier</li>
      <li>I like it so far.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t like these old plastic flimsy bottles with spray paint writing on it</li>
      <li>/&gt;Worse is that the liquid when finally worked into the hair makes your hair very sticky.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using Rogaine Foam for about 7 months so far</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not certain it&#x27;s worth the cost.  </li>
      <li>had Sandy not asked this question which was emailed to me by Amazon, apparently as part of a new marketing community / strategy.</li>
      <li>I seriously doubt this company did meaningful testing to learn how customers might want to change it.</li>
      <li>no more blank spots on top of my head.</li>
      <li>One literally had to NOT use it on the day(s) one wanted to look decent in public.</li>
      <li>The growth is not magic but adding it to10,000 of Biotin daily which I have been taking for 6 months has saved me from having spend a lot more money on the Vichy version which is imported from Europe.  </li>
      <li>does not mean that the next person will not</li>
      <li>I attempted to purchase the item detailed above (DS Laboratories Spectral DNC-N Topical Hair Loss Treatment, 2 Fluid Ounce), however, I received a different product made by the same company that has a consistency similar to that of the  green slime seen on Nickelodeon, with a familiar odor mimicking molasses.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 46 year old female.  </li>
      <li>I hope if I can learn if the differences between old and new ones are positive or negative...</li>
      <li>Noticed a dramatic thinning of my hair on top and on the sides all of the sudden.  </li>
      <li>My hair salon guy who suggested it never saw a single trace of new hair after 3-months of constant use.</li>
      <li>I wanted to sample other breakthroughs and new product for hair growth.</li>

<li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry before the next 24-hour application.</li>
<li> This stuff is working, but it&#x27;s a slow steady process.  </li>
<li> only  used it for less than a month so do not expect to see any results yet.</li>
<li> I also use Toppik Hair Building Fibers (you can buy on Amazon) to camouflage the thin spots and it really does help my thinning not be noticeable.</li>
<li> w/a lot of alleged science (your ingredients) to give it presence.</li>
<li> Plain and simple.</li>
<li> The bad is that 6 squirts of this stuff (along w/even modest normal body heat) has it running into your ears and eyebrows like 3-In-One Oil and leaving your hair totally oily-wet, un-combable or un-brushable.</li>
<li> This is how I know it&#x27;s not just water or other non-growth ingredients.  </li>
<li> i like it because it has no smell like other product</li>
<li> I am doomed due to genetics on both sides of the family.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure that this stuff actually works.  </li>
<li> Needless to say, my overall dissatisfaction is quite apparent.</li>
<li> Well I just purchased this product little less than a month after using 5% minoxidil of Kirkland, which is works for my hair.</li>
<li> Little noticeable change or results after two months...  </li>
<li> Again, not only were the consistency and odor points on contention, but the product left my hair with a greasy dirty look as well.</li>
<li> /&gt;Do not buy or waste your money on this product....</li>
<li> This formula irritated my scalp and any additional hair growth was imperceptible.  </li>
<li> you will waste your time and money...</li>
<li> I will give it a few months and if nothing happens i will stop.</li>
<li> /&gt;Do not buy or waste your money on this product.</li>
<li> This product is a total failure at least for the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
<li> I&#x27;m seriously considering  not purchasing this product again, after current supplies are exhausted...</li>
<li> I started seeing a lot of small hairs along the front hair line.</li>
<li> It was very heavy and looked like I had something in my hair.  </li>
<li> and my hair is slowly falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Unfortunately DS Laboratories discontinued spectral DNC-L (and other products that used to have minoxidil)</li>
<li> Pretty disgusting stuff - and not cheap.</li>
<li> A very thick coating.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> kind of hard to ensure this gets used twice a day, but am willing to give it 90 days.  The old DNC seemed to work, but ended up switching to other products and am now back to Revita.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this stuff actually works.  It certainly did not grow any hair.  I then purchased Kirkland Minoxidil and it&#x27;s growing hair like crazy so to be honest I think this product is inferior, even with it&#x27;s fancy box.</li>
    <li> I attempted to purchase the item detailed above (DS Laboratories Spectral DNC-N Topical Hair Loss Treatment, 2 Fluid Ounce), however, I received a different product made by the same company that has a consistency similar to that of the  green slime seen on Nickelodeon, with a familiar odor mimicking molasses. Thinking the botched order was my fault (as this has never happened before when dealing with Amazon) I went ahead and started using it. Again, not only were the consistency and odor points on contention, but the product left my hair with a greasy dirty look as well. Needless to say, my overall dissatisfaction is quite apparent. On a side note, in the past I have used the specific hair growth product detailed above (not the brown slime I received) and (in combination with the shampoo and conditioner) have been rather pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> You will never know if it works. The spray is not a spray. It is a very thick, sticky liquid comes out of the supposed sprayer nozzle but is not a spray so is very difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse is that the liquid when finally worked into the hair makes your hair very sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called DS Labs-Customer Service. I was told by the CS rep that the company was aware of both problems but it was not yet fixed. She suggested until then that it only be used at night even though the instructions say it must be used twice a day to be effective. Just what I need - &amp;#34;Sticky hair in bed all night&amp;#34;. This product is a total failure at least for the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also she refused to give any advice on how to return it saying Amazon was not an authorized reseller and I should not have purchased it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for 3-4 months. Definitely does NOT work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost a lot of hair that I used to have because of DNC-L that has Minoxidil. Unfortunately DS Laboratories discontinued spectral DNC-L (and other products that used to have minoxidil) and I had to use DNC-N.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using DNC-N. I am now back using minoxidil (different brand since DS Laboratories).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy or waste your money on this product. Nonoxidil does NOT work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minoxidil is the one that research support for hair regrowth not Nanoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect they will stop making nanoxidil once more people complain about it is uselessness!</li>
    <li> Well rhf smell is stronger than the ones I have bought from Istanbul right after my hair transplant minor surgery, also it made my drier as well more the first ones I have tried, but I can&#x27;t judge if it has any benefits on my hair or not since the affect if hair transplant will be mixed with this medicine...&lt;br /&gt;So I hope if I can learn if the differences between old and new ones are positive or negative...</li>
    <li> Little noticeable change or results after two months...  Perhaps my hair is a bit &#x27;thicker&#x27; but I&#x27;m not certain it&#x27;s worth the cost.  I&#x27;m seriously considering  not purchasing this product again, after current supplies are exhausted...</li>
    <li> I did not like this one.  It was very heavy and looked like I had something in my hair.  A very thick coating.</li>
    <li> I was losing my hair and it&#x27;s coming back and no more blank spots on top of my head. I&#x27;m a female</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for 2 months.  I bought mine at Dermstore.  I came to Amazon today to compare prices and saw some of the nasty reviews so figured I should post my experience.  I have not had any of the side effects some people have and have used it on my eyebrows as well.  The growth is not magic but adding it to10,000 of Biotin daily which I have been taking for 6 months has saved me from having spend a lot more money on the Vichy version which is imported from Europe.  We all have different reactions to products so just because I had no reaction does not mean that the next person will not but it is worth a try.  I still think Biotin is what helped me most.  A friend recommended it.  I use Natrol Biotin.  It does take a couple of weeks before you see the benefits of Biotin.  DNC-N allows me to use a topical Biotin in addition to the oral tablet.</li>
    <li> This stuff is embarrassingly BAD. I doubt it was ever tested for &amp;#34;consumer satisfaction.&amp;#34; I used it for three months exactly as instructed then stopped. The data sheet said that when I stop I would start shedding hair. THAT was the good news. The bad is that 6 squirts of this stuff (along w/even modest normal body heat) has it running into your ears and eyebrows like 3-In-One Oil and leaving your hair totally oily-wet, un-combable or un-brushable. And it doesn&#x27;t dry before the next 24-hour application. So if you don&#x27;t mind looking like a homeless person who hasn&#x27;t showered for days, this may be just the treatment for you. Pretty disgusting stuff - and not cheap. The DS Conditioner is nearly as bad... I&#x27;m convinced it has some sort of abrasive in it b/c it leaves you w/the feeling you have sand in your hair while still in the shower... but it&#x27;s just a feeling. I seriously doubt this company did meaningful testing to learn how customers might want to change it. My hair salon guy who suggested it never saw a single trace of new hair after 3-months of constant use. Not a &amp;#34;smidge&amp;#34;! One literally had to NOT use it on the day(s) one wanted to look decent in public. An amazingly over-blown, expensively-packaged, do-nothing set of products w/a lot of alleged science (your ingredients) to give it presence. This was the first product I truly wanted to warn folks about - but have never enjoyed putting-down products in public - and may never had gotten around to it had Sandy not asked this question which was emailed to me by Amazon, apparently as part of a new marketing community / strategy.</li>
    <li> Well I just purchased this product little less than a month after using 5% minoxidil of Kirkland, which is works for my hair. I wanted to sample other breakthroughs and new product for hair growth. I like trail and error. So I took a chance with this item and did some research. They have a YouTube commercial like video on this product explaining the ingredients and how it can go into smaller pores where minoxidil can&#x27;t penetrate. I said what the hey, let&#x27;s give it a chance.  I like it out the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I really can&#x27;t review on any type of hair growth (since this purchase I do see some thickness around my hairline). They have some cool information on YouTube explaining the key ingredients and how this stuff works. I like how the bottle is shape and also on the bottle it has detailed information written on it so it looks like it took time to produce. It wasn&#x27;t like these old plastic flimsy bottles with spray paint writing on it this looks very well manufactured and thought out. I like how it pumps the liquid onto the exact area where you need it.  I always prefer a spray rather then the drops. After it&#x27;s been in your hair for a while you can feel it working it&#x27;s like a funny sensation. This is how I know it&#x27;s not just water or other non-growth ingredients.  I feel the chemicals on my skull. I like it so far. I will keep using.</li>
    <li> This stuff really worked for my boyfriend in conjunction with his use of the DS Labs Spectral F7 Efficacy Booster.  BTW the Company who makes this stuff is very helpful when it came to asking which products work best for certain conditions.  I hated Rogaine because it smelled awful and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I originally tried ORIGINAL Spectral DNC and had great results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this so called improved &amp;#34;DNC N&amp;#34; is NOT WORKING and my hair is slowly falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this stuff, DNC N, religiously every morning and every night and my hair has started falling out just like it did before I started using the ORIGINAL Spectral DNC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled, the &amp;#34;DNC N&amp;#34; DOES NOT WORK!!!!</li>
    <li> Been using for 3 months.  I&#x27;m a 46 year old female.  Noticed a dramatic thinning of my hair on top and on the sides all of the sudden.  A female friend of mine told me she&#x27;s been using this for a year (you would never know she had lost hair, her hair is full and beautiful).  It is not user-friendly, the pump gets more product ON your hair than on your scalp.  I ended up buying a thin eyedropper at Walgreens and apply it with that so it goes mostly on my scalp.  It does make your hair look dirty.  You&#x27;re supposed to use it twice a day but I really can&#x27;t use it in the morning on days I work - it just looks like I didn&#x27;t really wash my hair.  I am also taking finesteride and spironolactone,  both prescribed by my dermatologist for hair loss as well.  If nothing else, so far I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve lost any more hair, but it will take months to really know if I&#x27;m going to regrow hair or not.  I also use Toppik Hair Building Fibers (you can buy on Amazon) to camouflage the thin spots and it really does help my thinning not be noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have used this before was purchase from hairdresser made my hair grow then I found it was the same product on here for cheaper but it made my hair started falling very badly so upset I have bald spots all around the edge has broken off really disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is a total  fake, it doesn&#x27;t look like the original, smell different and of course does not work, I was loosing more hair!! check DS labs for authorize dealers!!</li>
    <li> Toni, a master stylist at Chicago&#x27;s Anna George salon turned me on this product when I was in the city last summer. I needed a change in shampoos and my hair was thinning and stringy. She said try it for three months... I was skeptical but I knew she knew what she was talking about and I gave it a shot. Needless to say I am glad I did. In tandem with the shampoo and conditioner, my hair today is thicker, healthier and growing in as advertised. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> 6 months with no results. I wanted it to work but it didn&#x27;t work for me. No noticeable changes. Plus it smells bad.</li>
    <li> As all say, it has a really thick texture and it doesn&#x27;t smell good. It feels like you have gel in your hair, and because of that it makes my scalp be more visible. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy another bottle of this... I believe DS Labs know how to market themselves, with their name and presentation - but their products don&#x27;t work at all. Stick to Minoxidil.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does NOT work at all... you will waste your time and money...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not Minoxidil and has no effect on hair regrowth...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been on the market for almost a year... if you go to the website of DS Laboratories... you will find no information on it in the main website. Even if you email DS Laboratories... they have no information on it to prove that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband tried it for 3-4 months... he lost all the hair he used to have because of Minoxidil use... He is now back to Minoxidil from a different conmpany... the sad thing is that DS Laboratories stopped making Minoxidil products...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy or waste your money on this product.... DS Laboratories will lose a lot of customers because of this bad product... DNC-N... It just does NOT work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish DS Laboratories will make similar products like DNC-L... that was a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who give this product 5 stars comment on and grade the bottle more than the product itself!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50 and my hair was thinning noticeably and somewhat suddenly.  This stuff is working, but it&#x27;s a slow steady process.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now and can see a real difference.  It might be closer to a year before there&#x27;s a full a turnaround.</li>
    <li> In the areas that were thinning it has worked great, my hair has become much thicker! However its been slow going with okay results in the areas that have lost the most hair and for the greatest amount of time. I will continue to buy since its worked so well in the front and hope for the best in the back!</li>
    <li> Still unsure if this product actually works...as I am still in the beginning stages of the use.&lt;br /&gt;Overall...after reading into this product, has great reviews.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to be for my hair loss issues. It took about three months to begin to see results. Have been using it about a year now and see a great improvement in hair growth in areas that were the most effective. As with all these types of products, each person react differently . I have been pleased with the overall results. I will never have the full head of curls I had in my forties me this will have to do! Elly</li>
    <li> A friend recommended the product to&lt;br /&gt;Me and liked it. I&lt;br /&gt;Have only  used it for less than a month so do not expect to see any results yet. I will give it a few months and if nothing happens i will stop.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from hair loss for about a year or so.  I am doomed due to genetics on both sides of the family.  I have been using Rogaine Foam for about 7 months so far and it works for the back and top.  But my front hairline was still receding.  I started using DNC-N because I heard that it can help with frontal hair loss.  And it worked!  Within three weeks of using DNC-N I started seeing a lot of small hairs along the front hair line. I was blown away!  The worst thing about this is the residue that it leaves in the hair.  It would be really great if they could make it in foam form.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like DNC-N, it is very greasy and sticky and leave the hair and scalp sticky. Plus it smells bad.&lt;br /&gt;Sharon</li>
    <li> After almost a year with this product I think it might be time to give up. It seemed to be working for me where Rogaine wasn&#x27;t, but a year later I just don&#x27;t think it is worth the money. My hair is definitely thinning/falling out still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a mixed bag in terms of the quality of each bottle. Some are a bit thicker than others and some have a better spray head.</li>
    <li> This formula irritated my scalp and any additional hair growth was imperceptible.  Save your $$ for a transplant or shave your head.</li>
    <li> the other regular spray works better, this one clogs the sprayer and the efficacy seems to be the same.  I think the difference is the N</li>
    <li> Makes you lose hair. Plain and simple. And using &amp;#34;7pumps twice daily&amp;#34; certainly ensures DSL Labs that you will be buying more soon, as 2 oz lasts barely a few weeks.</li>
    <li> i choose this product becuase my doc. suggested to me.&lt;br /&gt;and i like it because it has no smell like other product</li>
</ol>
