      <li>It gives a fresh look to your face and is great for Spring.</li>
      <li>I go to Target! :)</li>
      <li>Basically, the color and the appearance are cute, the color is correct.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what i like. :)</li>
      <li>I will buy this again in many colors.</li>
      <li>really love it</li>
      <li>Choice of shades made finding my favorite easy.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time writing an Amazon review, and I&#x27;m doing it because I LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just bizarre, maybe it&#x27;s supposed to be a cool shade when warms are better suited for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m normally pretty happy with my lipsticks, and I really like Revlon lip butters, so I&#x27;d recommend those first.&lt;br</li>
      <li>;) haha lol</li>
      <li>Glides on silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I tried to layer it on, but the only pigment was a chalky pinkish sheen that doesn&#x27;t look that great.</li>
      <li>However, I like this light scent.</li>
      <li>This lip color is really smooth and moisture.</li>
      <li>works great, fast shipping, thanks</li>
      <li>Its actually kind of more red with a tint of orange.</li>
      <li>naturally dark blonde, and warm tones look best on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(It&#x27;s also pretty light, so you won&#x27;t even remember it&#x27;s there)</li>
      <li>This product is the absolute best, especially now for the summer.\&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy or oily.</li>
      <li>Nothing special on me but a good neutral pink to swipe on when on the go.</li>
      <li>Nice, but doesn&#x27;t last</li>
      <li>This is a soft lipstick that goes on easily.</li>
      <li>Feels pleasant, but the color is too pale.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe the other color whisper shades have more promise, but AVOID petal rebel!</li>
      <li>I will be buying more colors next time</li>
      <li>My natural lip color is a light-ish mauve/rose color, and at first it looks like it&#x27;s blending right in.</li>
      <li>I had petal rebel since I love rocking the pink lip since it goes so well with my skin tone and p&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a flavor to it.</li>
      <li>I love this pink</li>
      <li>It really is as buttery as everyone says it is.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very....</li>
      <li>and i cant really wear lipstick</li>
      <li>I saw this on Pinterest and was kind of shocked when I received it to find it a very neon pink color, not so great on me</li>
      <li>Light pink.</li>
      <li>Liked it enough to buy a little gifts for my friends.  </li>
      <li>It looks very natural on the lips.</li>
      <li>Natural looking.</li>
      <li>Ordered and loved the texture, but the pink and it was way to pink and not very shear.</li>
      <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t like lip products that make my lip stand out too much like lipstick does, so if you&#x27;re not used to wearing lip products and don&#x27;t want to look/</li>
      <li>Pleasing pale pink color, pleasing presentation, nicely packaged.</li>
      <li>Color Whisper has just enough color and richness for me to be comfortable to use everyday.  </li>
      <li>It has a soft, subtle (but strong enough to make a difference) pop of color.</li>
      <li>I expected it to be more like a stain, and less like pink chalk ground up in vaseline...</li>
      <li>decent sheer pink.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Petal Rebel, although it looks bubblegum pink in the tube, goes on almost clear.</li>

<li> IT IS NOT A STRONG COLOR BUT MERELY A TINT.</li>
<li> BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED..</li>

    <li> This lip color is really smooth and moisture. It doesn&#x27;t really have a flavor to it. However, I like this light scent. I will buy this again in many colors.</li>
    <li> With so many glowing reviews, I had to try this out! I am fair-skinned, naturally dark blonde, and warm tones look best on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petal Rebel, although it looks bubblegum pink in the tube, goes on almost clear. My natural lip color is a light-ish mauve/rose color, and at first it looks like it&#x27;s blending right in. I tried to layer it on, but the only pigment was a chalky pinkish sheen that doesn&#x27;t look that great. It&#x27;s just bizarre, maybe it&#x27;s supposed to be a cool shade when warms are better suited for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m normally pretty happy with my lipsticks, and I really like Revlon lip butters, so I&#x27;d recommend those first.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the other color whisper shades have more promise, but AVOID petal rebel! It hardly shows up and it&#x27;s totally different from the tube.</li>
    <li> Feels pleasant, but the color is too pale. I expected it to be more like a stain, and less like pink chalk ground up in vaseline...</li>
    <li> I actually don&#x27;t like the consistency it&#x27;s very.... Like grainy and it&#x27;s not really translucent I had petal rebel since I love rocking the pink lip since it goes so well with my skin tone and p&lt;br /&gt;It did not moisturize and left my lips looking pasty I&#x27;ve seen this being compared to the revlon lip butters ..... MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!!!;) haha lol ps I actually forgot to say I lost my color whisper so yea that goes to show how much I loved it!!;P</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Light pink. It looks very natural on the lips.</li>
    <li> This is my first time writing an Amazon review, and I&#x27;m doing it because I LOVE this product! The color is definitely not as strong as lipstick or lip tint would be. It has a soft, subtle (but strong enough to make a difference) pop of color. Personally, I don&#x27;t like lip products that make my lip stand out too much like lipstick does, so if you&#x27;re not used to wearing lip products and don&#x27;t want to look/feel overwhelmed by a lip color, this is the product for you! (It&#x27;s also pretty light, so you won&#x27;t even remember it&#x27;s there) I bought Orange Attitude, and its not exactly orange. Its actually kind of more red with a tint of orange. I will be buying more colors next time I go to Target! :)</li>
    <li> Nice, but doesn&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> works great, fast shipping, thanks</li>
    <li> I love this pink color--  It gives a fresh look to your face and is great for Spring. It isn&#x27;t thick/ heavy so it needs to be reapplied throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This is a soft lipstick that goes on easily. It works well also, if you use a lipstick brush. Pleasing pale pink color, pleasing presentation, nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> I saw this on Pinterest and was kind of shocked when I received it to find it a very neon pink color, not so great on me</li>
    <li> decent sheer pink. Nothing special on me but a good neutral pink to swipe on when on the go. Not much staying power.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in Petal Rebel. It gives a natural pink tint to the lips, making them look a little &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34;, is how i would explain it. Glides on silky smooth. Natural looking. That&#x27;s what i like. :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34;, or coated feeling that I&#x27;ve found in other lipsticks.  Color Whisper has just enough color and richness for me to be comfortable to use everyday.  Choice of shades made finding my favorite easy.  Liked it enough to buy a little gifts for my friends.  They liked it too.</li>
    <li> These four stars are given for the lipstick &#x27;s color. The left one star is cut by its smell. Basically, the color and the appearance are cute, the color is correct. But it smells like a chemistry medicine, and I tried to put it on my mouth but I cannot stand that strage smell. I would buy anthor lipstick and I will use this one for taking color.</li>
    <li> Ordered and loved the texture, but the pink and it was way to pink and not very shear. Gave it away and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I got this in Petal Rebel. It&#x27;s a great lipstick. It really is as buttery as everyone says it is.</li>
    <li> This color is so beautiful and stays on very well! I just absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> THE AD ON TV IS MISLEADING. IT IS NOT A STRONG COLOR BUT MERELY A TINT. OTHERWISE IT IS A&lt;br /&gt;COMFORTABLE TEXTURE. I WISH I COULD BE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED..</li>
    <li> This product is the absolute best, especially now for the summer.\&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy or oily. Doesn&#x27;t cake up &amp; stays quite a long while.&lt;br /&gt;I really love it and it comes in wonderful colors.</li>
    <li> Well, it came before i expected so thats good but... im a kid and i cant really wear lipstick and i didnt know because it wasnt in the description so... i kind of like it...</li>
