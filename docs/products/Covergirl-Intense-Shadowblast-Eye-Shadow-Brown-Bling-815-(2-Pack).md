    <li> Love this product! So disappointed when it was discontinued in stores.</li>
    <li> I love this product,color and how it stays on your lids without smudging!</li>

    <li> I just put my dry eyeshadow over it and it lasts all day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  However, over the last year or so, it&#x27;s just not to be found in any of the stores.  So, straight to Amazon I went where I was able to order a few of the same to keep in stock.  For me, it&#x27;s a wonderful product.  The color is great and I get many questions about the look of this eye shadow.  As long as I can keep purchasing this Covergirl product, I&#x27;ll continue to go right on wearing it.</li>
    <li> Glad to find them as they have been discontinued</li>
    <li> The best shadow I have ever worn.</li>
    <li> On time and I love the shadow.  I think they stopped making it so I&#x27;m glad I found it here!</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I can still get this color! The price was good!</li>
    <li> Also bought green.  Used product before.  Put primer on eyelids so no irritation.</li>
    <li> Great product. Stays on all day without fading or collecting in the crease of my eyelid. Brown Bling is a perfect neutral color, you can layer the shadow for a darker color/look. And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, even if I fall asleep wearing.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Great color that lasts. No settling into lines. Have used this since it came out. Just love it!</li>
    <li> Love this shadow, hard to find!</li>
