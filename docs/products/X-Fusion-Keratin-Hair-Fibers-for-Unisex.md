      <li>I would recommend to anyone who has thinning hair,Xfusion fills in great and loks natural.</li>
      <li>It washes off easily in the shower.  </li>
      <li>and it is still fine.  </li>
      <li>excellent product-gives texture to limp, fine hair</li>
      <li>Amazon is the best place to buy for the price; local salons sell the product as well, in the regular size, for more than the price of Amazon&#x27;s economy size.</li>
      <li>This product is super.  </li>
      <li>More confident to go out in public.  </li>
      <li>Looks real!</li>
      <li>Got it fast!</li>
      <li>Too hot in FL for wigs.  </li>

      <li>I have tried many other products, sprays, powders, etc.</li>
      <li>The coverage is fine at first but after a few hours it starts to clump up, I wish I had gone with the Toppix instead.</li>
      <li>I use a fairly large amount of it on a daily basis, but still when purchasing the large economy size, one bottle lasts me about 30-40 days.  </li>
      <li>It does leave a slight residue in the tub, however, it cleans up easily.</li>
      <li>I shook some of the XFusion on my &amp;#34;problem areas and WOW!</li>
      <li>The &#x27;Dark Brown&#x27; color is spot on and the price is right!</li>
      <li>Only complaint I have is that I can&#x27;t get the salt &amp; pepper fibers for a better match?  </li>
      <li>It  covers all bare spots.  </li>
      <li>I have hereditary female baldness, especially on the top, and I am so thin, a comb over is not even possible.  </li>
      <li>I will recommend this product highly to my friends waging the war on hair loss due to age and heredity.</li>

<li> Have used it for a few years now.  </li>
<li> A small amount covered my thinning hair spots in seconds with a fuller, healthy-looking head of hair!</li>

    <li> Great stuff.  I wish I had been told about it 30 yrs ago.  I use it every day.  Too hot in FL for wigs.  It  covers all bare spots.  More confident to go out in public.  I HAVE received lots of compliments..Like, ( what are you doing different to your hair?)</li>
    <li> Wife uses these are she has thin hair, has tried other brands in the past but keeps coming back to this. Covers very well and looks great</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Have used it for a few years now.  Previously purchased it from the hair dresser, but this was a bigger container at a cheaper price.  If your hair is thinning, it will help.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years and can&#x27;t go without it.  It is *exactly* as advertised.  I have thinning hair on the top of my head and can even leave the product in, when warranted, overnight and it is still fine.  Perspiration does not effect the product.  It washes off easily in the shower.  I use a fairly large amount of it on a daily basis, but still when purchasing the large economy size, one bottle lasts me about 30-40 days.  Amazon is the best place to buy for the price; local salons sell the product as well, in the regular size, for more than the price of Amazon&#x27;s economy size.</li>

    <li> Great product.I would recommend to anyone who has thinning hair,Xfusion fills in great and loks natural.</li>
    <li> This product is super.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  I have hereditary female baldness, especially on the top, and I am so thin, a comb over is not even possible.  When I shake this on, you can&#x27;t even tell there is a problem.  I have tried many other products, sprays, powders, etc. but this one tops them all. It does leave a slight residue in the tub, however, it cleans up easily.</li>
    <li> ;) great service from Bubbles!!</li>
    <li> I received my economy sized container of XFusion Keratin Fibers yesterday, thanks to my Amazon Prime account... Love that 2 day free shipping! I have shoulder length hair but have been fighting thinning hair loss on my scalp, as well as a thinning &#x27;male pattern&#x27; bald patch. I&#x27;ve tried one other hair loss product that did the trick but the cost was prohibitive. I shook some of the XFusion on my &amp;#34;problem areas and WOW! A small amount covered my thinning hair spots in seconds with a fuller, healthy-looking head of hair! I will recommend this product highly to my friends waging the war on hair loss due to age and heredity. The &#x27;Dark Brown&#x27; color is spot on and the price is right! I will definitely be ordering this product again!</li>
    <li> Love this product....does exactly what I wanted....covers my thinning areas and matches my hair color perfectly.</li>
    <li> product is wonderful, service was excellent</li>
    <li> Blends nicely with my hair.  This product can hide the signs of thinning hair.  If you ever get a hair transplant use this product to make the hairs thicker. Looks real!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!  Got it fast!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Couldnt be happier with the results.</li>
