<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just bought this at my local big lots for $3.50 half the price on Amazon. And I got to say I love this stuff already. I have really damaged hair and after one use can tell the difference.i will definitely go back to big lots today and stock up on all the ones left lol.</li>
    <li> The best product out there to restore shine, improve texture and &#x27;mend&#x27; (if that is possible) split ends. I absolutely recommend this to everyone. Especially good for longer or color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I am African American and wear my hair natural and I must say this conditioner really strengthen my hair.  I need a strong and deep conditioner because I was going to wear braids this summer instead of my normal Afro.  So I washed first with a sulfate free shampoo by cream of nature and used this conditioner on my hair.  I got underneath a warm dryer for about 20 minutes with a plastic cap over my head, rinsed and then applied an ION extra moisture cream conditioner and sat again under dryer for about 25 minutes with a plastic cap on my head, rinsed and then applied the ION leave in conditioner.  I applied ION heat protectant and blow dried my hair and it cam out strong and silky.  MY beautician was happy on how strong and tangled free it was :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;s ok, you do have to watch how much you use, otherwise it too much protein will snap the hair.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Works well on fine, dry hair. Really adds shine and does not weigh your hair down. I will use this from now on.</li>
    <li> Makes my curls bounce back nice and springy after one use.  I&#x27;m a 4a natural, corkscrew curls, lots of shrinkage.  Anytime my curls feel a little limp, this is my go-to.  I can&#x27;t find a comparable treatment that has collagen and amino acids.  Holy grail product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 38 yrs old and have tried so many products over the years in an effort to control my frizz.  My hair is wavy, dry, and frizzy.  I do not perm or color treat my hair.  I blow dry straight with a round brush and most of the time end up pulling it back within 10 minutes of walking out the door even on a semi-humid day because it kinks and frizzes so badly.  I even bought a really good flat iron to no avail.  Have tried letting it be it&#x27;s natural curl and it&#x27;s a mess, frizz everywhere and like so many of you I have spent an enormous amount of $ on products only to be disappointed again and again.  Well, I read about this product yesterday in my search for yet another product that might help and used this for the first time this morning with the Nexxus Moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (as recommended on the box).  I could immediately feel the difference in the shower when rinsing this product out and for the first time EVER I have frizz free, soft, smooth hair.  Absolutely amazing product!  Thank you Nexxus.</li>
    <li> I tried this product years ago and was impressed. It instantly stopped my hair breakage.  Fast forward some years,  the condition of my hair is dull and breaking.  I had tried other hair products, then I remembered Emergencee , used it and now my hair is in good condition.  I now tell family and friends of this product.</li>
    <li> Well, I LOVE this stuff regardless of the bad reviews. Instead of everyone getting &#x27;so crazy&#x27; over this product, it&#x27;s best to remember that not every &#x27;thing&#x27; will work for &#x27;everyone&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I know is that &#x27;EMERGENCEE&#x27; works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now then, my hair is not really damaged... but I do COLOUR it, and I do use a BLOW-DRYER, HOT ROLLERS, and my HARD-BONNET HAIR DRYER all the time so... it just seems prudent to me to incorporate a PROTEIN RECONSTRUCTOR and DEEP CONDITIONER from time to time. And I&#x27;ve got the healthy hair that shows what I&#x27;m doing in this regard is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN TO USE--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, you&#x27;re going to use EMERGENCEE more often if your hair is badly damaged, i.e. BREAKING; SHEDDING; COMING OUT IN GOBS when you wash or brush/comb your hair; and after a bad colour-job where your hair literally feels like &#x27;MUSH&#x27;, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How badly your hair is damaged will dictate how often you&#x27;ll need to use EMERGENCEE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got &#x27;BREAKING&#x27;, I&#x27;d use it once-a-week til your hair is strong again. One bottle should do the trick, maybe two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is &#x27;COMING OUT IN GOBS&#x27;, you&#x27;re gonna use it every day until it&#x27;s no longer coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is like &#x27;MUSH&#x27;, you&#x27;re gonna use one application right after another until it no longer feels like mush! (i.e. if, after rinsing out the first application, your hair still feels a little mushy, put another application right back on). It won&#x27;t hurt your hair at all... indeed, it&#x27;s SAVING your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After repairing whatever terrible damage has been done to your hair, you should use EMERGENCEE like I do... every SIX-to-EIGHT WEEKS. I time this for TWO DAYS before I go to the salon for a colouring. You want to use it before colouring your hair because PROTEIN will strip the hair of colour-dyes; thus, if you use it after, you&#x27;ll lose the colour/highlights/whatever you just paid your hairdresser to put in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since everyone&#x27;s hair is different, the SIX-to-EIGHT week routine is a guideline. If your hair starts breaking, or whatnot, then perhaps you need to do it every four weeks. You&#x27;ll have to experiment to see what &#x27;timing&#x27; suits you best.&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE METHOD--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. WASH your hair with a &#x27;CLARIFYING&#x27; SHAMPOO... the Brand doesn&#x27;t matter. You want to use a clarifying shampoo because you&#x27;ve got to get all the residual crap, (namely styling products), out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I then WASH my hair again... only this time I do use a certain Brand: &#x27;Creme of Nature Professional Detangling &amp; Conditioning&#x27; shampoo. I use this Brand because it leaves my hair coated enough that I can get a wide-tooth comb thru it without having to use a cream rinse or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have this Brand, (or don&#x27;t want to bother getting it), then just wash your hair, towel dry, and carefully comb the tangles out. You really don&#x27;t want &#x27;product&#x27; on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got &#x27;MUSH&#x27; for hair, or it&#x27;s &#x27;COMING OUT IN GOBS&#x27;, then DON&#x27;T COMB! Just gently towel-dry and apply the EMERGENCEE using your fingers to gently work it thru your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I towel-dry my hair, comb it smooth, and apply the &#x27;EMERGENCEE&#x27;. I like this Brand because it works, of course, but also because it&#x27;s THICK and GLOPPY... it doesn&#x27;t run, (like &#x27;water&#x27;), all over the place. I COMB it thru my hair, CLIP my hair up, (my hair is bra-strap length), put a DISPOSABLE SHOWER CAP on, and then SIT under my hard-bonnet HAIR DRYER for 40 MINUTES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Now, I DON&#x27;T CARE that the directions say to put it on in the shower and leave it for 3-Minutes. It won&#x27;t work well using it that way. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for I-don&#x27;t-know-how-many-years now and I&#x27;m here to tell you that all 3-Minutes will do is waste the product, along with your time and money, and all withoutgiving you the results you&#x27;re looking for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Then I take another shower and RINSE it all out... BUT, (although you&#x27;re instructed to do so in the directions), I DO NOT SHAMPOO AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I just RINSE it all out, TOWEL-DRY my hair, and IMMEDIATELY apply a &#x27;DEEP CONDITIONER&#x27;. In my case, I use &#x27;SILK ELEMENTS MEGA CHOLESTEROL CONDITIONING TREATMENT&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. I CLIP my hair back up again, along with the DISPOSABLE SHOWER CAP I rinsed out from the &#x27;EMERGENCEE&#x27;, and I&#x27;m back under the DRYER for another 40-MINUTES. Then I RINSE that out, TOWEL-DRY, and let my hair AIR-DRY the rest of the way. And I stay that way, (no more shampooing or using styling products), until I go to my colouring appointment two days later.&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE &#x27;FEEL&#x27; OF THE PRODUCT WHILE IT&#x27;S WORKING-- STIFF, STIFF, STIFF!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, then... YES, your hair will feel STIFF and STRAW-LIKE in the extreme when it&#x27;s on your head. So-much-so that you&#x27;ll feel like you could break your hair right in half! BUT-- it&#x27;s SUPPOSED TO FEEL THAT WAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;PROTEIN&#x27; IS NOT a Conditioning or Moisturizing agent. What you are doing with a &#x27;PROTEIN-PACK&#x27;, (like EMERGENCEE), is REDEPOSITING the &#x27;PROTEIN&#x27; you have stripped from your hair from colouring it, perming it, relaxing it, and the every-day abusive actions of Blow-Drying, Flat-Ironing, and blah, blah, blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first-time I gave my husband a &#x27;PROTEIN-PACK&#x27; treatment with EMERGENCEE, (he has long hair), he came running into the kitchen a few minutes later all in a panic that something was terribly wrong, (I had put him under the dryer and gone into the kitchen to make us a snack). I asked, &#x27;What&#x27;s wrong?&#x27; He said, &#x27;My hair is all stiff, it&#x27;s gonna break-off!!&#x27;, (I thought he was gonna burst a blood vessel, *lol*). I laughed and told him, &#x27;Nothing is wrong. All that stiffness means it&#x27;s WORKING!&#x27; I then had to explain to him what I just explained above, and put him back under the dryer, *lol*.&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SUMMARY--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER... A &#x27;PROTEIN-RECONSTRUCTOR TREATMENT&#x27; IS A TWO-STEP PROCESS---&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;STEP ONE&#x27; is REDEPOSITING THE PROTEIN by using a PROTEIN-PACK like &#x27;EMERGENCEE&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;STEP TWO&#x27; is to then immediately REPLENISH THE MOISTURE in your hair by using a DEEP CONDITIONER like &#x27;SILK ELEMENTS&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And remember this too... IT ALL WORKS SO MUCH BETTER WITH HEAT.

One must really begin to understand the &#x27;CHEMISTRY&#x27; of hair. Hair is 98% PROTEIN, (called &#x27;KERATIN&#x27;), and 2% WATER. BOTH NEED TO BE REPLENISHED on a regular basis. It&#x27;s a very good and healthy habit to get into.&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PICS PICS PICS--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve posted some pics of my hair here so you can see and determine for yourself whether you might benefit from an EMERGENCEE Protein-Pack Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JANUARY 6-2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, a word about &#x27;WATER&#x27;. If your tap is &#x27;HARD-WATER&#x27;, then the MINERALS, (which constitute &#x27;Hard-Water&#x27;), are not only in your body thru drinking the WATER, but are also being deposited in your hair&#x27;s CUTICLE, (as well as being absorbed thru your skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need an example? Well, here ya go: Ya know those white, opaque spots that are on your glasses in the dishwasher, or what everyone calls &#x27;SOAP SCUM&#x27; on your shower doors and walls? Well, those are MINERAL DEPOSITS; and they&#x27;re in your hair, and on your skin, too. And, while washing your shower door and walls with soap and water doesn&#x27;t remove them, (special solvents are required), neither will shampoo get it out of your hair either. You need special shampoos to accomplish this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem with WATER, whether &#x27;HARD&#x27; (Mineralized) or not, is that ALL WATER is treated at our Municipal Water Plants with CHLORINE, (yes, as in &#x27;Bleach&#x27;), hence, it&#x27;s also being deposited in your hair. Because CHLORINE binds to the PROTEIN in your hair, (hair protein is called &#x27;Keratin&#x27;), it can, and will, change and/or fade the colour of your natural, or processed, hair... especially processed hair. And which is why, blonde-haired people who swim in a swimming pool find their hair turning green. CHLORINE also evaporates at room temperature, so you are breathing in the toxic fumes as you shower as well... ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we all bathe in HOT WATER, the PORES of our skin are open, (as are the &#x27;SCALES&#x27; that make up the CUTICLES of our hair), thus receiving with open-arms the mess of trouble that MINERALS and CHLORINE shackle us with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the symptoms of all this bad business are: Dry, Itchy, Flaky skin, (which includes your scalp-- Dandruff, etc); and Dry or Oily, Flat, Dull, Lifeless, Wiry, and/or Frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are suffering from any of this, I strongly suggest you install a &#x27;SHOWER FILTER&#x27;. It will rid your WATER of the damaging MINERALS and CHLORINE, and give your now &#x27;unclogged&#x27; scalp, hair, and skin the ability to be cleansed properly and, (perhaps for the first time in a very long while), the ability to BREATHE again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remembering that our bodies are approx 60%-plus Water, you may very well find that you require fewer products to manage your hair and skin. Because they are no longer fighting-off the damaging and toxic effects of MINERALS and CHLORINE, your hair and skin drink-up the PURIFIED WATER and reflect their restored health back to us in softer, smoother skin, and silkier, shinier, and more manageable hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an &#x27;AQUASANA&#x27; shower filter; (and, no, I am not affiliated with Aquasana in any way other than as a very happy customer).nd put him back under the dryer, *lol*.&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SUMMARY--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER... A &#x27;PROTEIN-RECONSTRUCTOR TREATMENT&#x27; IS A TWO-STEP PROCESS---&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;STEP ONE&#x27; is REDEPOSITING THE PROTEIN by using a PROTEIN-PACK like &#x27;EMERGENCEE&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;STEP TWO&#x27; is to then immediately REPLENISH THE MOISTURE in your hair by using a DEEP CONDITIONER like &#x27;SILK ELEMENTS&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And remember this too... IT ALL WORKS SO MUCH BETTER WITH HEAT.

    <li> Now this item I&#x27;ve been using for a while band it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. I used to purchase this at local store, but then they would never have it in stock. But Amazon is the best. :-). As long as you follow the directions ( by the way you do not need to use the same brand shampoo) it works. I love to put highlights in the middle of my mane so this product works numbers. Plus in the winter I shed a lot but if you are committed to using this you will not have that issue. I stop using this for a year because I didn&#x27;t know about Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t find any in stores. Now that I have Amazon I will not go empty. Dry, colored and chemically treated hair should invest in this.</li>
    <li> I am amazed after the first use and can&#x27;t wait to see what this does to my hair long term.  My hair is fine, wavy and very brittle from color treatments and styling.  If I pulled very gently on a strand of hair, it would split and break instantly.  After one use, my hair doesn&#x27;t break or split when pulled and feels pretty strong actually.      I followed some other reviewers&#x27; comments and did not wash my hair after I rinsed out the product but just used a good conditioner.  I did not have time to leave it on my hair for more than a few minutes, so I am excited to try an even longer soak in period next time.</li>
    <li> This product works well. I use it once a week and I notice that my hair seems to have more strength.</li>
    <li> I have tried using this twice and gave up on it. If anything it makes my hair more tangled and dry than it was to start with. I am really not sure what it is supposed to do or what kind of hair it might actually help. I have long fine hair, easily tangled, and this neither smooths nor untangles it. It is watery and seems to be some sort of fake product, the way it does nothing. It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve ever tried on my hair that seemed to have absolutely no effect at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t understand some reviews preaching how you leave this on and it gets hard, blah blah blah...... this sort of wrecks my hair. My hair needs moisture, not to be parched to bone hardness. Kerastace Ciment Anti-Usure CIMENT ANTI-USURE makes my hair gorgeous and is basically a fast easy rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and let&#x27;s not forget the great protein pack Joico K-Pak! Joico K-pak Reconstructor, 5.1-ounce That is everything this one isn&#x27;t. It makes my hair full, shiney and moisturized, like new hair.</li>
    <li> Very good hair treatment.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It stops my breakage and makes my hair soft and smooth. My only complaints are that it is difficult to find in stores and that you pay a lot for small amount.</li>
    <li> WOW! this word sums up my thoughts on this product. I have super fine, heavily color-treated hair which was described by a couple of stylist as \\&quot;far beyond any help\\&quot; Everyone would always comment they were surprised I wasnt bald by now (Im only 21!!) but I dye my hair every month sometimes a couple of times a month going from dark brown to red to brown to blond and so forth. I also blow dry and use a straightener about 3 times a week.So let&#x27;s say that an old used broom had more shine and silk than my hair. I&#x27;ve always looked for products to help my hair but none really work, I had completely given up on my endless search for the perfect treatment because after spending so much $ on products that promise so much and deliver so little I started to think that really there was no help for my poor hair..... UNTIL i came across this product. It is incredible, pricey for such a small bottle you might think but not pricey for the results it delivers. After using it the first time I didn&#x27;t notice the biggest change, It did seem shinier and definitely softer but it wasn&#x27;t until the second time I used it that I was completely amazed my hair is absolutely restored!! my hair hasn&#x27;t been this silky and soft in a loooong time. Definitely worth it for hair emergencies that are crying out for some conditioning. Try it!</li>
    <li> When I was younger, I had fine-voluminous hair type 3b/c which I altered chemically with coloring and whatnot.  Years ago, I came across the Nexxus Emergencee product and thought to experiment and see if it&#x27;ll restore my hair texture from previous hair coloring to healthy again.  Due to my ineptitude and lack of interest to follow instructions, the end results were horrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the end of 2008 RD, my hair started to fall out profusely from the roots which I attributed to Yaz (Birth Control Pill) which I was on.  These hormonal changes also caused me to have shorter period cycle.  My hair-loss was so tremendous that even after discontinuing the BCP (around mid 2009,RD) my hair-loss perdured until I subsequently decided to give Nexxus Emergencee a second try prior to not succeeding with other innumerable amounts of hair products to end my hair-loss battle.  Among my many attempts I include a BKT which mirages quick hair repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I have been using the Nexxus Emergencee and although I&#x27;ve only used this product three times (PROPERLY) since my last purchase a month ago, I am happy to report that less and less hair is falling out from the roots.  My hair is no longer the same in volume; however, I am sure that with Nexxus Emergencee, an incorporated bottle of Biotion 1000 mcg (purchased this spring 5x a day), and optimist expectation...the hair volume I once had will definitely return.  My hope is that this review helps those esp who have suffered or is currently suffering from hair loss due to Yaz, or any other Birth Control Pill.  These culprits are so detrimental to hair growth cycle (and hormones).</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews, but it is nothing that I expected.  It has not helped or even condition my hair.  I am disappointed.  I believe this product is not worth the money, not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> This product is God sent. A classmate in graduate school recommended this product to me. I was a little hesitant because I held the ignorant notion that nexus products would not be effective of ethic type hair. My hair had begun to break due to the rigorous expectations of medical school (stress) and lack of time to care for it, as my hair demand (I went three years without getting a trim due to time, hair is extremely dry). I have used this product for almost a year now and my hair has gone from a inch past my shoulders to nine inches past my shoulders and I accredit it to this product. My hair use to retain so much water and naturally dry in a Diana Ross/Shcoka Kon style and now my hair dries in half the time similar to the nexus commercials.  Yes my hair is commercial quality, beautiful and filled with body due to this product. Try it you will be so glad you did.</li>
    <li> I have used this product previously.  It is really great when your hair is dry and brittle from the weather or swimming, etc.  However I ordered this product in mid-July. It is now mid-August.  I haven&#x27;t received it and no one wants to take responsibility for losing my package.  The Postal Service says FedEx and FedEx says Postal Service.  The Postal Service states they are having problems with FedEx scanning a package and not delivering it.  Of course, my statement is, why are you wanting the customer to run down your FedEx problem?  I won&#x27;t be ordering from amazon.com anymore.  Its too much of a hassle.</li>
    <li> I began losing my hair at a rapid rate due to medical conditions. Doctors not helpful in how to address so I researched on web. I  found this product and started using it and it was awesome - it made a huge difference in strengthening my hair so it stopped breaking off, and significantly slowed the hair loss.  I was also trying Nioxin products at same time &amp; their hair products didnt help at all - I was very disappointed.  Their shampoo thickens hair shaft slightly, but Nexxus Diametress does much better job.  (The Nioxin Biotin viatmins, though, helped hair re-growth substantially -much more effective than their shampoo/scalp treatments or other Biotin tablets I tried.)  I have been using both products for about 3 months now and my hair is almost recovered even though I have ongoing medical issues.  (Have used other Nexxus products in past and they have been awesome -their Biotin and Diametress products are excellent for thin hair.)</li>
    <li> Okay--not sure what I really expected. Did not see much of a difference in hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair. I got a perm that literally burned my hair and scalp. I went from long hair to a super short pixie which was traumatic enough, but what hair I had left was very fuzzy, frizzy, dry and brittle. It broke off whenever I combed it. I spent hundreds on hair products, keritan masks, deep conditioners, all which offered various levels of disappointment. This product was a miracle for me. After one use there was dramatic change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was already using the nexxus humectress shampoo and conditioner, and purchased the deep conditioner along with this. I followed the directions on the bottle, shampoo, treatment, shampoo and condition. I left the treatment on 5 minutes, longer then the bottle says, and the deep conditioner on for 20. I repeated the process 5 days later and my hair is soft, so much less frizzy and seems less brittle. Its still very damaged, but is now manageable enough for me to stop thinking about shaving my head. I really think this product is worth a try. Going forward I will use ever 2 weeks as directed on the package and am hopeful it will continue to get better.</li>
    <li> Let me be clear, this stuff is NOT going to 100% heal your hair. But it will make it look and feel a lot better.          The under layer of my hair had been dyed from a natural light blonde to black many times over the course of two years. When I decided I wanted the black gone, I dyed it red. That ended up some awful mix of pinkish red and black so I bleached it and the rest of my virgin blonde hair. And kept bleaching it. I bleached it twice in a weekend with 40 volume on the bottom and 30 on the top then another time a couple weeks later with 30 volume. I kept up with my roots but every time I did my roots I would put it back on the ends to get the rest of the black out. My hair was totally healthy for some 5-6 bleachings (which is kind of amazing). But the last bleaching killed it. Just totally killed it.       My super long thick curly hair shed out (or broke off) to about half the thickness and about 4-5 inches shorter and felt disgusting. I cried because I though it was all going to fall out or just be so ridiculously thin.  I tried the ion stuff from Sally&#x27;s and it helped a little but not enough. I was scared to even touch my hair let alone style it. So I turned to the internet and found this.          I shampooed my hair with Nexxus moisturizing, towel dried it a bit, didn&#x27;t comb it, then used the Emergencee. I put it all over my hair, let it air dry for a bit then alternated between blow drying and air drying for about an hour (because my hair is long, took that long to dry). It did get stiff but I wasn&#x27;t worried because I knew that was normal. Then I rinsed it out, didn&#x27;t shampoo again but put in a deep conditioner (I used Nexxus again but you don&#x27;t have to) and repeated the blow dry for another 40 minutes to an hour before I rinsed that. I&#x27;ve used it three times now and will get another use or two out of it.        If your hair is that damaged do NOT wash it every day (or get it wet. it&#x27;s a lot weaker wet). I used to wash my hair every 3 days because itwasn&#x27;t oily and now I only wash it once every week or so. I didn&#x27;t blow dry or straighten it the first two times I used it but this time I let it mostly air dry then blow dried it a little. I straightened it on the lowest setting and even though it&#x27;s still thin, it LOOKS thicker. And very shiny. It&#x27;s shedding and breaking less (but let&#x27;s be honest, that&#x27;s not going to stop completely if you have murdered your hair).          It&#x27;s definitely still damaged but it just looks and feels so much better and being able to style it a little makes me really happy. Plus my hair is growing fast (which it usually does but I was worried because damaged hair can grow slow). So you guys who have just way over bleached, use this!!! I wouldn&#x27;t use it for virgin hair unless your hair falls out or breaks a lot or something like that. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from breakage around my hair line area, from over processing my bangs and layers in the front with blowdrying and flat irons. There is one area of my hair that is unbelievably brittle, just seems to grow in that way and nothign has been able to fix it. This product seemst o be working to tame it adn stop the brittle feeling and the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first tiem i used it i had washed my hair with the nexxus moisturizing shampoo then put this on for 5 minutes. it went on like a hot oil treatment, felt kinda greasy and oily. but i left it on and then rinsed it out. you have to either use the shampoo again or put on a thick moisturizer after it is rinsed otu though. otherwise it feels like oil slick or grease. i didnt notice until i was blow drying my hair how much better it felt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am going to use this twice aweek, its worth the money!</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair, you must use this product! I&#x27;m a hairdresser and it&#x27;s one of my favs.  Got to Mafia Hairdresser dot com to see my blog on the product and how to use it with the best impact.</li>
    <li> I had heard about this product for a long time but wasn&#x27;t convinced it would work. Well, I was WRONG. I could tell a difference with the first use. I only wish I had used it sooner. My hair felt stronger almost immediately. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a review on a hair product before, except for the Kerastase Elixir. But I was so happy with this product that I decided to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Nexxus Emergencee Strengthening Polymeric Reconstructor as a temporary fix until I could afford to buy Kerastase Bain de Force products, which are supposed to make your hair softer and stronger. My hair had been though a lot, including color stripping, brazilian keratin treatment (which contains formaldehyde), daily heat from blowdrier and straightening iron, and it was completely fried. The ends were completely dry and brittle, and I had lots of split ends. I was using the Kerastase Fibre Architecte but didn&#x27;t notice a lot of improvement (which disappointed me becase I love most of Kerastase products). My ends still looked horrible and dry after I finished styling my hair using that product. No shampoo or conditioner I bought at the pharmacy was making my hair soft or doing anything for my hair.  One day while I was washing my hair, I noticed my hair was falling more than the usual, there was literally clumps of hair coming off as I rinsed it. My hair used to be very full and became very thin. That&#x27;s when I decided to look for a product to stop the breakage and hopefully stop my hair from falling so much. I found the Nexxus Emergencee Strengthening Polymeric Reconstructorproduct on Amazon and after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try since it was only 12 bucks. I then read some reviews that using in conjuction with the Nexxus moisturing shampoo and deep conditioner helped even more. So I went to Walmart and bought the small sizes of the moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, in case I didn&#x27;t like them I dind&#x27;t want to waste a lot of money. And I also got the Nexxus Humectrees deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my product arrived and I went to use it. Let me start by saying that I first used the Nexxus moisturizing shampoo, and I instantly felt the difference from other shampoos. This shampoo actually made my hair soft and I could tell it wasn&#x27;t as harsh as other shampoos. I loved the way it smelled too. I then put on the Nexxus Emergencee Strengthening Polymeric Reconstructor and left it on my hair for about 15 minutes. It felt weird on my hair but I didn&#x27;t mind as I had read on other reviews that it was going to feel that way. I then rinsed it and used the Nexxus Humectrees deep conditioner and left it on my hair for about 20 minutes and rinsed it again. I instantly felt my hair to be much softer, and easier to comb through. The ends actually felt nice and smooth, and my hair was much shinnier. My husband commented on how good my hair smelled as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that day (which was about 5 days ago) I have washed my hair twice with the moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, and used the Nexxus Emergencee Strengthening Polymeric Reconstructor and Nexxus Humectress deep conditioner once more today. Let me just say my hair feels AMAZING! I no longer have the dry brittle ends after I style my hair. I feels like I got a hair cut, and I love touching my hair because it is so soft. No product has ever made my hair feel like this, except for the Kerastase Elixir. I will definitely keep using the Nexxus products and will buy the full size bottles, and I&#x27;m in love with it. They are comparable with the Kerastase Nutritive Bain Satin products, which I have used before but are much more expensive. So I will use the Nexxus more often in between the Kerastase products when I get them, since they are pricier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> There was some good reviews on this and I thought I would notice a difference but I havent. Its been over a week and my hairs a little softer but I also changed shampoo&#x27;s so beware .. The price was high wont be buying again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially if your hair is dry or just needs weekly or monthly maintenance.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product, really makes my hair strong and helps it to grow. Wish they would put it back in stores.</li>
    <li> this is the only product that takes the frizz out of my permed hair. I&#x27;ve tried every product that anyone has ever recommended and this is the only one that works.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;m Asian but have always complained about my super-long, thick, and stick-straight hair. Over the last 15 years, I have ruthlessly bleached, colored, and permed it without much problem...that is, until this past Christmas.    A friend of mine learned about a place that does &#x27;digital perms&#x27;, which are currently all the rage in Asia, and convinced me to go with her. Since my last perm was 2.3 yrs ago and my last bleaching (for pink hair) was almost a year ago, I figured my hair was ready for another process. When I left the salon, my hair looked pretty good and curled in the cutest way (of course!) but two days later, I started to notice that all of my pink strands of hair were starting to look fried (what you would imagine your hair to look like if you ever got hit by lightening). It was so dry and matted that attempting to detangle it with my fingers would result in breakage.    I got on Amazon and immediately ordered this and the Bumble &amp; Bumble Deeep. I tried Deeep first and it seemed to help a little. A week later, I tried Emergencee and it seemed to work at least twice as well in softening up my crunchy strands. Unfortunately, when my hair dried after Emergencee, I noticed that my $200 perm was pretty much non-existent. I figured it was because I used Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisturizing Conditioner so it was weighed down but it has been over a week and it is still just as flat and uncurly as ever. So, to recap...    (1) What I had to start:  * Slightly wavy hair  * Slightly dry hair  * $200 in my pocket    (2) What I had after perm:  * Big sexy curls  * Very dry brittle hair  * $0 in my pocket    (3) What I have now after Emergencee:  * Slighty wavy hair  * Moderately dry brittle hair  * $0 in my pocket    So although I will say that Emergencee definitely works, I&#x27;m undecided as to whether it worked well enough for me give up my expensive perm in less than 2 weeks. In my opinion, #3 of the above scenarios is definitely the worst.All I can do now is to keep using this product and hope that it will work well enough to turn my hair back to scenario #1 (minus the money of course).</li>
    <li> My hair had been breaking off so I tried using this once a week for 6 weeks. It made it feel softer for a day or two but did not stop it from breaking. I have since learned that I have low thyroid and that is why it is breaking so I am taking medicine to get my levels back up. This product may work for someone who just has overstressed hair.</li>
    <li> Just tried the nexxus emergencee and i am not impressed. I usually have alot of hair loss during washing/ post-wash styling. Based on the reviews, I decided to try it to see if it would reduce or stop this hair loss. However, I can&#x27;t say i saw any change. I don&#x27;t think I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff? After one use I can barely recognize my hair. The texture and strength has improved dramatically! I am tempted to use it again, but I need to wait another week, as it says to use about every two weeks. Wow is all I can say.</li>
    <li> Item was as described, great transaction.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous. Whenever my hair seems a little lifeless, I know it&#x27;s time for one of these treatments.  And the best part: it takes all of three minutes.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I think this product has been discontinued but it has been a very good restorative conditioner for my fine, color treated hair for years.  I use it prior and following color treatment.  Wish I could locate a source, hard to find.</li>
    <li> I have a very damage hair. After use this it makes my hair soft and will not break as easy. Price is much cheper then H2O and the rest is great. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> For getting this size bottle, you can get about 4 uses out of it, I have used it 3 times with enough left over for a last time.  Now that I have used it, I&#x27;m glad I just got the sample size because it&#x27;s really just an ok product.  I dont know, I am African American with 4c/4b mixed hair, and it really does nothing for my hair.  I got this because Ateeya said it was good, and also another African American person, but I think I might try Aphogee, or maybe I dont need a protein treatment (but I used this in conjunction with a deep moisturizing shampoo AND a conditioner AND a lotion to make sure I didnt have a protein overload) because I got this to make my hair not break so I could see some growth, but when I brush my hair after, I still see little hairs on the counter, which defeats the purpose of this product.  On top of that, it&#x27;s expensive, even for this sample size.  Maybe they have changed the formula since they said to use this product, but as of a month ago when I first started using this product, my hair hasnt benefited, but thankfully hasnt been damaged, from using this product.  It just wasnt for me...  Tip  When you put it on your hair, dont freak out when it makes the texture change.  It washes out fine, I just felt that it makes my hair feel matted when its on there, but thats just how it works, I guess... And the first time I used it I left it on for the recommended time, but the last two times I left it on for 5 minutes, maybe if you leave it on longer, it might work better... but if your hair falls out, you didnt hear that from me :-p</li>
    <li> I bought this product and i already used  4 times, it says you can use every 2 weeks, i have really weak hair and it breaks so much that my bathroom floor is full of little pieces of hair..i hate that!  I still didnt notice any improvement, but im gonna keep using untill im done with the bottle and if i see any direfence i will keep using or not.</li>
    <li> This works great for my bleached hair and makes it feel healthy (or as much as I can hope for). I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not as good as it used to be (years ago).</li>
    <li> My hair was not that badly damaged and I used this to make it perfect. Well it made it worse like a rubber band texture. I don&#x27;t want to imagine a person with really bad hair having to use it. also it doesn&#x27;t even come sealed. I would not recommend this at all. Instead try the Salerm hair care products they are prefect and they really help your hair back to health. I know because I have done it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser told me to purchase this product after I \\&quot;self highlited\\&quot; and caused extensive damage to my hair.  I don&#x27;t like the feel of this product in my hand.  I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels when I use it and the smell is not great.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this! I only sold it in a larger size.  I bring this with me to my salon for a deep condition treatment!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this stuff is supposed to be. It&#x27;s horrible. Makes your hair hard. Feels like you have hairspray in your hair for days...after several washings. Gross. Keep it!</li>
    <li> i went on a bleaching/colorfix/dyeing spree a few months ago. it left my hair insanely stretchy, dry, weak, brittle. anything that can be used to describe completely debilitated hair could suffice in accurately depicting what sat upon my head. i tried a lot of conditioners, masks, treatments. and nothing really helped. i don&#x27;t remember how i fell upon this, but i went nuts reading reviews about it and decided to try it myself. i went to the CVS by my house and bought a bottle for about $16.00 or so. i&#x27;ve done two treatments since purchasing it and i can say that my hair is about 95% repaired. oh my god it&#x27;s insane. i truly never would have expected anything to work on my hair because of how bad it really got. now it&#x27;s soft, manageable, and i can actually tell it&#x27;s growing faster now. due to it&#x27;s insane damage before, the growth was simply crawling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i followed the rules that fairemaiden posted (she posted them on the other places where reviews were hosted as well, so you can tell she means business in how to instruct people to use it) and left it in my hair for the allotted time (40 minutes under a dryer) and rinsed out, then applied a deep conditioner for 20 minutes under heat. then i rinsed that out. my hair instantly felt better once i washed it out. wowwwwwww i am so happy lol. also note that while the treatment is in your hair WILL get hard/straw-like. so don&#x27;t be alarmed because that is supposed to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all, this is a great product. i didn&#x27;t think something like this existed! it has really brought my hair back to a state that i completely forgot about.</li>
    <li> After totally killing my hair I truly needed something to bring life back, I only used in shower for a few mins. and wow absolutely amazing my hair felt great!!!! I have very thin fine curly hair and this stuff worked great!! After the 1st initial time I used it I decided to try the longer method others have suggested 2 months later and didnt notice any difference in the results from the quick 3min in shower tx, either way its a great product for extremely damaged hair and would def reccomend</li>
    <li> This product helps my colored, straightened hair feel amazing. I love this product!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product to me, at first I was reluctant to try it but when I did I was really happy with the result.  My hair has been thining and dropping out for sometime now and after i used the product i have seen some improvement.  I would certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. Too many chemicals. Try weledas rosemary oil instead. I have super dry brittle blonde dyed hair and the rosemary oil seriously conditions it and improves the texture like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. This stuff not so much. My hair felt dry, looked dry, frizzy and worse. Save your money... Try rosemary oil or coconut oil. Shampoo hair, put rosemary oil in hair thoroughly focusing on the ends. Put shower cap on, leave in for 2+ hours, then rinse shampoo and condition as usual. You will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I have course hair that I have colored from dark to light on numerous occasions. This product is a keeper in my hair care routine. I use it every time I wash and condition my hair. It makes your hair smooth, manageable and prevents tangles. I pray that Nexxus never discontinues this product. I would be loss without it!</li>
    <li> My hair starting to get stronger, healthier and stop breaking in about 60% in just  four weeks! It works better when you use a clarifying shampoo every three weeks.</li>
    <li> Used to buy this from a salon before Nexxus went mass-market.  But then couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in stores like Rite-Aid, CVS, and Walgreen&#x27;s.  So, was glad to find it here and ordered two bottles.  It&#x27;s better than nothing, but doesn&#x27;t work like it used to -- I wonder whether the formula has changed?</li>
    <li> First of all, I must say that I am a huge Nexxus fan. I am aware of, and I have tried better products, but I owe Nexxus for making my dream of having silky long hair a reality. Being racially mixed have many advantages, but sometimes those combinations come out a bit wacky...to make the story short, my hair is silky soft, but very, very curly and the result is crazy breakage. It was very hard for me to grow my hair. Until my beautician started treating my hair with Therappe shampoo, Emergencee and Humectress. She would trim my ends every 6 weeks and in less than a year my hair had reached past my shoulders and a few months later it reached almost the middle of my back. This may not sound like much, but for someone who could never grow her hair longer than a short bob right under the ears this is HUGE. Emergencee makes your hair strong and supple and resistant to breakage, if you use it correctly and take care of your hair.</li>
    <li> I put a little in my hair about the size of a pea and leave in my hair after washing. MAKE SURE to comb you hair out before putting on your hair. This is the only way I can use it. Otherwise it does make your hair hard and impossible to comb out. It will make a huge difference trust me been using for over 7 years.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, has never let me down!</li>
    <li> I would like to say that this treatment is good. Not the best, but good. And when I say good, I mean it&#x27;s good enough to have your hair straight when blow drying. I notice how the smell isn&#x27;t as strong which is a plus. When I applied it to my hair, it glided through after I washed my hair with Aussie. Then, instead of using a hard hat dryer (I don&#x27;t have one), I used a hand dryer in order to get that hardness underway. I managed to get it hard enough, then I rinsed and followed with Alba shampoo and Profectiv conditioner. This stuff is great, but as far as completely stopping breakage... may take a few treatments in order for that to happen. Overall, it&#x27;s great when you&#x27;re done with all the rinsing and preparing to blow dry because while I was blow drying, my hair was a lot less frizzy than it usually would be and the texture was breathtaking, but I still experience a little breakage. I&#x27;ll keep trying, though! No need to give up!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Emergencee, and I really love how easy and simple it is to use.  Unlike other protein treatments that have to be in for a long time, you only need to leave this in for a few minutes.  It really strengthens your hair and improves the condition of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, 2C waves, and this boosts my curl quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a strong smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair once you wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for a fast protein treatment.</li>
    <li> I need more of this stuff. I regularly abuse my hair and this stuff works MIRACLES I tell you. The difference is drastic and lots of people compliment me on how healthy my hair looks when they know I dye it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this stuff is not for you if your hair isn&#x27;t damaged or you only use heat styling every so often, so of course you won&#x27;t feel a difference. This is for people who bleach, heat, and fry their hair on a semi-regular basis. ;)</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie and have spent shameful amounts of money on products that don&#x27;t work. This is one of the more expensive things I&#x27;ve tried - but this one really works.    You should be warned - this is NOT a deep conditioner. When you rinse it out, you really need to follow it up with a good moisturizing conditioner and leave it on for 3 minutes or so.  If you do not, you will rinse this out and think your hair feels like straw and you&#x27;ll be horribly disappointed.  I know I was. But if you follow it up with a good conditioner, you&#x27;ll notice a huge difference. My hair has never been so soft or felt so healthy.    I used it once a week for two weeks, then backed off to one time every two weeks. I have fairly long hair and I&#x27;m getting about 6 uses out of a bottle. Even though this is on the expensive side, I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love it. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> If you have problem hair, this I can honestly recommend. I use it aprox. once every two weeks (as is advised in the directions), and I can FEEL its strength even as I apply it from my hands. My hair instantly feels stronger and more solid. I begin with shampooing as usual, applying the product and leaving it for a few minutes, then I rinse and follow up with my usual conditioner. This does what it says, although I think for hair such as mine (frizzy, dry, damaged), I&#x27;d really need to use it more than twice a week to see any very long-lasting benefits.</li>
    <li> My wife and I bought this product for our young daughter because she has a hair condition in which her hair is soooo dry that it constantly breaks off thus appearing as if she doesn&#x27;t have much hair. The hair she does have doesn&#x27;t even feel like hair it feels more like carpet that is until we started using this product. The first time we used it we noticed that her hair really felt soft when we finished. By about the 4th time we used the product my daughters hair felt normal all of the time, it is no longer breaking off and even has developed a sheen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We had tried everything from oiling her hair twice a day to using perscription medication to try and help but nothing did. This worked; now I will admit that by the 4th treatment we were using the Nexus Shampoo and Humestress Conditioners in conjunction with this product so that may have helped as well but this about the best haircare product I or my wife have ever seen.  &lt;br /&gt;This is a reconstructor people, not shampoo or conditioner it&#x27;s there to fix what is broken in your hair not smell good, use the shampoos and conditioners in addition to this product for that.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on amazon, I loved the result. I was left with beautiful hair, smooth, shiny and very healthy! I really recommend this!</li>
    <li> Absolutely unbelievably amazing product!!!  I truly cannot believe the difference it&#x27;s made in my hair after only ONE use! My hair is naturally curly and therefore naturally dry, and I color it at least once a month. I recently cut my hormone replacement therapy down to half the dosage I had been taking for many years and my hair started falling out like crazy and was so parched, limp and lifeless, I was desperate. My stylist said she couldn&#x27;t believe how drastically my hair had changed since she saw me last. One use of this product made a miraculous difference...my hair feels like silk now...it&#x27;s shiny and looks fuller and healthy again, it&#x27;s so easy to style and is straighter and smoother...I&#x27;m no longer battling the frizz. I pray Nexxus never stops making this product or changes it in any way, and I only wish you could buy it by the gallon!!!! Worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY of its price!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great when u use it with the recommended nexus shampoo and conditioner. I have curly and frizzy hair and when I use this I and blow it out strait and u never guess it was curly!</li>
    <li> It was an alright product,did not smooth my hair cuticle like I had hoped but is not a bad product.it is better for less damaged hair than mine,I am planning to go to my hair salon and get a professional redkin treatment for 20 dollars,that is the better buy for my money</li>
    <li> You cant find anything better than this for fixing damaged hair. I am a profession hairstylist and there has never been anything made that compares to this. Its the best.</li>
    <li> This stuff is saving my hair. There&#x27;s been a dramatic reduction in breakage and I&#x27;ve only used it twice on my relaxed hair. If you&#x27;re suffering from hair breakage, I highly recommend it. Be prepared to order it though, as I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a store yet.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 3 months ago and it is a miracle in a bottle.  My hair was breaking off for unknown reasons. After the first use, I noticed my hair stopped breaking.  I use this product every two weeks on my relaxed hair.  The key is to wash your hair with your regular shampoo, rinse and then put Emergencee on.  Leave it on for at least 5 minutes.  (Once I went outside and did a little shopping and came back.) Wash the product out with water only, then shampoo your hair again and condition and style as usual.  My hair is stronger, healthier, and bouncier then it has ever been. When I comb my hair in the shower or out of the shower there is little or no breakage.  I could go on and on about this product.  I will never do without it.</li>
    <li> I tried both the Nexxus Emergencee and the Kera Care Reconstructor.  Both are pricey, but the Nexxus product left my hair strong and easier to style.  I have fine, natural hair that was broken off due to relaxers, dyes, etc. If your hair is breaking off and feels dry to the touch, you need to give it a try.  Two or three weeks and then every other week as needed.  You will feel the difference.  Always use with a good moisturing shampoo and conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product yet on my hair as I&#x27;m on a \\&quot;healthy hair journey\\&quot; and it&#x27;s not time to use my protein treatment. So I can&#x27;t give a review of the product. BUT I can tell you that the shipment was very fast and the price wasn&#x27;t bad either. I&#x27;ll definitely come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update*...I really love this product. It does the job as it says. My hair has little to no breakage whatsoever! I&#x27;ll be using this as my choice of Hard Protein.</li>
    <li> This made my hair stronger for sure!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine, curly hair. It breaks if you look at it wrong. I highlight and style with heat. I have spent hundreds of dollars on products to help my baby fine hair and stop the breakage. I tried Emergencee today and am super impressed! My hair is healthier and significantly more managable! I used the recommended shampoo and conditioner too.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair is after a couple of months! I will never be with out this product again. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love it !!!! A +++++&lt;br /&gt;Super RECOMMEND !</li>
    <li> I was losing hair due to post menopausal hormone changes so bought this as a treatment and it seems to have helped some. I used it twice in the first week and then only once a month as adding too much protein to the hair will make it brittle.you&#x27;ll need a really good conditioner directly after this protein treatment.  I  used Nexus Humectress Ultimate Moisture Conditioner after rinsing out Emergencee and my hair felt so soft and luxurious.  I also started taking Biotin  and Omega 3  supplements and my stylists said I should see improvement in two months. She also recommended massaging my scalp so the hair follicles don&#x27;t die, since I only wash my hair every 5 or 6 days. By the way, Emergencee will feel stiff once applied to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I want to highly recommend for hair loss, Nexus Emergencee/Nexus Therappe/supplements Biotin &amp; Fish Oil as a treatment plan for losing hair. I started September 24, 2013 and as of December 10, 2013 I finally noticed the hair loss stopped. By the way I also had my Thyroid checked by the doctor, and it was normal. I used the Emergencee 3X the first month, then 1X per month. I use the Therappe as a deep conditioner 1x week. I take Biotin and Fish Oil daily. All recommended by professionals and researching online. Worked for me, hope it works for you!</li>
    <li> Amazing results using this product. Great deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I used this product 20 years ago when my hair was over processed and falling out and it worked wonders then and still does now.  I learnt my lesson and don&#x27;t over process but it you use heated styling tools and the ends of your hair are split this works wonders.</li>
    <li> I was told how wonderful this emergencee was and I had to try it.So I found it on amazon and followed all the directions my hair felt like hay when I had it on then it started falling out all over the place.I lost alot of hair and this is supposed to be a conditoner.My hair felt worse then when I started.I had to go have it cut.When I first got it I opened the bottle and noticed it was a watery brown liquid.I didnt think that looked right but I still used it.Maybe I didnt get what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I always buy it if I&#x27;ve over damage.. my hair because it brings it back to a healthy look.</li>
    <li> I did not see a big difference in my hair.  I use it for a whole month.  It is ashamed because I was looking forward to it working!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve colored my hair for over 20 years, plus hair texture changes over time (sadly, not for the better). Emergencee is the only product I&#x27;ve found that truly restores my hair to pre-process teenage hair. I shampoo, apply Emergencee and if I can I use a 20 min heat cap, then rinse very thoroughly (NO 2nd shampoo as instructions suggest), then condition. I&#x27;ve done this for the past 7 years and everyone from stylists to strangers comment on my beautiful &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair. It definitely works for me!</li>
    <li> Great product as always. Does wonders for my curly, fine hair. It gives me a great boost of body and volume.</li>
    <li> I used to use this stuff on my relaxed hair and it was always amazing at stopping breakage after I&#x27;d been using too much heat.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d follow the regimen then deep condition and the breakage would stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to try it with my now natural 4c hair since I still use the Humectress conditioner with good results. The brutual winter&#x27;s effects are now showing in my hair. Hopefully it works. I will update.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! Wonderfull, I love iy it really works!! I used and i sae hoe my hair really changes in a littler time!</li>
    <li> I have fine, dry, damaged hair and I use this every couple of weeks when I want my hair to look thick and full for a special occasion.  My hair feels like a different person&#x27;s after use - very full.  I think it might be too much if you have heavy or thick hair to begin with, however.</li>
    <li> I am a natural medium/dark golden blonde and I bleach my hair to platinum about every 4 weeks (mostly to touch up the roots but i will pull the bleach/dye through for about 10-15 min at the end to brighten overall). My hair is medium long. After my last touch-up, my ends were looking a little rough and my hair seemed to have some mushy parts when it was wet. It&#x27;s not unusual for me to use about 5 different products on it before I even start the hour long blow dry process to make it smooth and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, last evening before I went out, I used Emergencee in the shower. I left it on about 5 minutes or so, after washing with a moisturizing shampoo, and then followed the treatment with moisturizing mask then conditioner. I was in a rush and had no time to blow dry, which I rarely ever do since it will my hair takes hours and hours to dry and is impossible to comb through.  My hair dried quickly and beautifully on it&#x27;s own! It was so smooth and shiny and felt thicker. Even my friend who doesn&#x27;t color her hair remarked how shiny it was and how it felt as soft as her &#x27;virgin&#x27; hair. I had natural waves in my hair instead of frizz ends and wild poofy volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am thrilled with this product. I love my platinum hair and Emergencee will make it possible for me to keep it! yay!!!</li>
    <li> I tried everything, and I mean everything after I got a really bad overprocessed perm on top of color treated hair.  My hair looked like straw and felt even worse. I broke 2 combs just trying to get a comb through it.  My daughter in law is the manager of a beauty supply store and recommended several professional only products which are supposed to be excellent which did little or nothing.  In desparation I went to the local Walgreens and picked up the Nexxus Emergencee, expecting it to be the same as everything else I tried. I don&#x27;t even know why I picked it from all the others on the shelf. I guess because of the name and this was an emergency!!! It looks different from anything else, it is an amber color gel.  When I put it on my hair, it felt really awful, dry and coarse and tangle-y and I expected no results.  I left it on 2 minutes and rinsed my hair and immediately felt a difference.  But you do have to follow up with a conditioner as this stuff is a reconstructor, not a conditioner.  I used \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; as the conditioner after rinsing out Emergencee, and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  My hair was a totally hopeless frizzed out straw patch, and this brought it back to life.  Not like it was before the perm, but as close as anything that I have ever used, and believe me, I just spent a fortune on products that didn&#x27;t work.  It is really great stuff if you have damaged hair.  I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good protein treatment to help my breaking hair for months.  I first tried the Organics hair mayonnaise, with no success.  My hair still was weak and breaking off.  Then I tried Aphogee 2 step protein treatment, and instead of helping, I experienced even more breakage once I was through with it (and I followed the instructions to a T). After reading all the great reviews on Nexxus Emergencee, I decided to try it out.  I am so glad I did! I used it with the Nexxus humectress as advised on the box. For the first time ever, my hair felt silky, smooth, moisturized, I was able to comb my hair with a very fine tooth comb with NO hair remaining in it!! I usually get knots when I comb it while it&#x27;s wet, and it keeps tangling up, not this time, the comb was just gliding right on through!! I highly recommmend this product, used in conjunction with Nexxus humectress, it truly works wonders!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the good reviews, I used it this morning and first when you putting it on there is no feeling in the touch of that it will work or make any corrective changes.  In fact it is one of the worse products in its result.  I styled my hair and still nohing added to the improvement in any shape or form of texture, performance or improvement , about the same result as water.  try something else his does no deliver, save your money</li>
    <li> This treatment has stop my hair from breaking in just a little under a month, two treatments.  I recommend this to anyone that their hair is damage from heating elements to the hair.</li>
    <li> This product is very good for hair and it is easy to use.  I recommend for anyone with damaged hair.  It strengthened my baby fine curly hair.</li>
    <li> The first thing I must say about this product is that it can do wonders for your hair, but only if you use it properly and have realistic expectations. Nexxus Emergencee is a hair Reconstructor and not a deep moisture product so you will need to use a rich moisturizing conditioner after using this product.     I have curly, heavily damaged hair from a hairstylist who bleached half my head to a white blonde color. Needless to say I started losing clumps of hair and I did one deep treatment after another with no significant results. That is until I found this little bottle of gold! It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell its just different. It will spread easily through your hair and one bottle lasted me 8 full treatments on my below shoulder length hair. I also use it once a week without any problems.    I used it on clean, slightly damp hair. After fully saturating my hair with the product, I apply low to medium heat for 20 to 30 minutes. This drys in my hair rock hard!! Thats good because it means it has allowed all the protein ingredients to bond correctly to my hair. When its dryed into my hair I carefully wash it out making sure not to disturb the hardened hair until it is rinsed out fully and then I apply the most mosturizing deep conditioner I have. I let that sit in my hair for 30 mins to an hour then rinse and my hair comes out amazing!!! You will notice a huge difference in the condition of your damaged hair after 2-3 treatments depending on how often you use it.  It will just about be back to its previous condition before the damage occured.     I highly recommend this product to anyone with damaged hair who needs a reconstructing treatment.</li>
    <li> Used it only once, will try again in a week. I&#x27;m waiting to be amazed. Wondering if I did something wrong. Message me if you have had great results. Hunbrat@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> What I can&#x27;t figure out is how this works in just a couple of minutes, but it does! Have used many products for my strong but abused (keratin straightening, hot iron, blow dryer, highlights, etcetera,) thick but very dry hair. It&#x27;s amazing how well this works. After I get my highlights my hair gets really brittle but using this brings my hair back to life. The shine and strength are restored. Directions state just leave it on for a minute or two which is what I do but have heard people say it&#x27;s even better to leave it on 20-30 minutes...May try that!</li>
    <li> This product really does what it says it does.  Hair breakage stopped immediately.  I had used this product many years ago for over processed hair and the formula is still a miracle worker.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this product even though I read great results. After years of relaxing my hair it became thin and lifeless. I must say after the first use of this product in conjunction with Nexxus Humectress ultimate moisture conditioner, my hair looks remarkably different. Co-workers and friends noticed instantly. My hair is bouncy, full and soft. I am very happy with this purchase. There is a new version of the product in a bigger bottle sold also on amazon, nexxus polymeric emergency reconstructor.</li>
    <li> This product can be purchased .... fast .... seller and good quality .... I am satisfied .................</li>
    <li> Nexxus is a great brand, but this product did nothing for me. Actually I really don&#x27;t like the feeling in my hair. I might not be using it right. I don&#x27;t know. I bought Carol&#x27;s daughter hair mask and it did the wonders I needed to happen. If you want your hair to be in its best use Carols Daughter mask.</li>
    <li> I have been using  Nexxus products for over 20 years.  This product  has not only restored my chlorine ridden hair for past 15 years but I have continued to use it with Kerraphix conditioner to maintain healthy balance, elasticity, shine.  I am 55 years old, my hair is blonde, to the middle of my back, I have it color treated and I still swim 8 miles per week.  My hair is beautiful! It is increasingly harder to find this on the shelf in stores.  I took a chance and found it on Amazon.  I couldnt be happier!  thank you so much Amazon!</li>
    <li> I followed the directions of another reviewer, and started to leave it on for 30-45 minutes instead of rinsing it out right away. Then I usually do the same with deep conditioner right after. I have baby fine, dry, chemically treated hair, and I was looking for something to help prevent breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it helped. It&#x27;s not the miracle product I was expecting it to be, but for a couple of days my hair feels a little bit stronger. Maybe I don&#x27;t use it often enough, but the bottle is small, and stock keeps running out, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something I will buy on a continuous basis. When I bought it, it was prime shipping and cost about $13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I wasn&#x27;t using the Nexxus shampoo and conditioner with the Emergencee. Might make a difference!</li>
    <li> This is a terrific protein treatment - seals my hair, gives it shine and body. I leave on at least half an hour and sometimes blow-dry before I rinse.</li>
    <li> Exactly as listed fantastic product for damage hair</li>
    <li> I recently had the Japanese Hair Straightening done on my hair. This time my hair started failing out. A hairdresser recommended I use this product as well as the Nioxin #3 for chemically treated hair. After going to several drugstores, I  finally found this product. I could tell a difference after the first use. The product is a type of gel without any noticeable smell that goes on your scalp and seems to seal the hair in. My hair loss went from alarming to just a few hairs falling out. IF you purchase it for stopping hair loss you should also consider purchasing biotin [[ASIN:B000BY2N7S NOW Foods Biotin 5000mcg, 120 Vcaps]] and a silk cap at night to wear. Also brush from the ends and as mentioned you must get a good deep conditioner otherwise this product will leave your hair feeling stiff. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with the outcome. My hair feels almost the same even after three treatments. Might work for someone else though as my hair is very damaged (but then, this product is for damaged hair right?).</li>
    <li> Product okay, there are so many products out now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife. She recently had her hair color processed blond. The chemicals used to color her hair are very harsh, so she was having severe breakage(she&#x27;s a natural brunette).  She used the emergencee and noticed immediate results. Her hair stopped breaking, it had volume, and even felt stronger. We recommend it to anyone that has had chemically processed hair,or uses heated styling tools. If really works!</li>
    <li> I have used this product in various occasions and it works leaves your hair strong and beautiful specially for over treated hair</li>
    <li> I use this treatment on my first list-relaxer shampoo to help restore keratin lost during chemical treatment. It feels a little slimy, but gives good coverage. The smell is a bit medicinal-like and the bottle is very small for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product, works great, and would work great...I just have medication issues, and this may not be good for me right now. BUT, I have had this before, and it is excellent.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Worth trying, especially on color treated hair!!!</li>
    <li> I used Emergencee many years ago and it was the best product I ever used on my hair.  This time, I followed the instructions on the bottle which I shouldn&#x27;t have done.  When you use this product, leave it on fir 20 min to half hour. Do not shampoo out but rather rin s r with plain warmish water which will allow some product to remain in your hair.  That&#x27;s what gives you the magnificant beautiful body.  Will try it again  very important: I called Nexxus because some sellers spell Emergencee &amp;#34;Emergency&amp;#34;. That&#x27;s not anything Nexxus ever put out. Also, they only sell it in the smallest size.  So if you&#x27;re buying a bigger size, you&#x27;ve bought something else. Call nexxus for more info.</li>
    <li> I love that product because after I use my hair chance to good is thicker and brightly and I stop loose hair I recomend is excelente</li>
    <li> If your hair is extremely damaged, you will need to use this product with a plastic cap under the dryer for at least 15 minutes. It will not stop the breakage after just one use. It take a while for this to work.</li>
    <li> I am currently loosing my hair, it is breaking off. So I read a review that gave instructions on how to use this product. I got very excited, and after just one use, not as many hairs came out. My hair also feels like it does when you first come from the salon, all bouncy and shiny. So cool, I am stocked up and have it on auto ship. Women of color, get this stuff it was made for us.</li>
    <li> I had a straightener over heat and burn out while I was using. It resulted in 2 large sections of the top layer of my hair burning. It was very noticeable  since the hair was dry frizzy and very damaged. Looked like 2 big crimped chunks in my hair. This product, WOW, although my hair is still damaged this stuff made it soft, shiny and almost appeared to completely disappear. This will definitely due til the damage portion grows out although I will need to purchase several bottles to keep up the maintenance.</li>
    <li> I have been having a difficult time with my hair of late because it&#x27;s damaged, so I was desperately trying to find something to help or a least stop the damage. This product is more than worth the price. After one use I truly feel the difference. Just follow the instructions completely and it&#x27;s amazing...a miracle! I&#x27;m going to start the regular delivery service of this product because it is all I&#x27;ll use on my hair from now on...</li>
    <li> Thanks a lot, I absolutely loved this product. My hair has been soo dry for the past year and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why. I would put oil on my hair and it would shine temporarily but  would still feel so stiff and dry to the touch! I have been conditioning my hair like crazy and did not see any fantastic results...until NOW! I applied Nexxus Emergencee RSCT to my hair to remedy shedding and wham! ALOT less breakage, that crazy shine that has eluded me over a year and my hair is so soft to the touch! Wow! Three birds with one stone! Even when my hair gets frizzy it looks good now. After I used this treatment I used a lot of conditioner because as you know this will make your hair HARD (which scared me anyway, even after I read all the reviews. I just had to talk myself through it!). This product was perfect, so happy I bought it and I will purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found the Nexxus Humtectant daily conditioner to work faster and just as well as this deep conditioner. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, my hair did not respond well to this treatment. I left it on for five minutes and followed it with an oil-based shampoo and Nexxus Humectress conditioner. When I first got out of the shower, my hair felt well conditioned but as my hair began to dry, it took on a strange texture and felt even more brittle, limp, thin and fly-away. I should probably mention that, even prior to using this treatment, my hair was in very poor condition due to being dry, thin, fine and having been colored once per month for the past 15+ years. But that was my reason(s) for trying this treatment in the first place. So now my hair feels like it is in an even worse state than it was prior to using this treatment. I would like to give it another try, but I&#x27;m afraid to because my hair simply can&#x27;t take being any further damaged than it already is. :(</li>
    <li> No bueno. Its hard and sticky and gross. Maybe I got an expired one or something, it was a strange consistency.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I followed the direction on the back, except I sat under the dryer for 20 min  and deep condition for 45 minutes, no more shredding at all. My hair came out bouncy and shiny:) I delected the step where it says to shampoo, I rinse out the protein treatment very well and then I deep condtion for 45 min , rinse out deep condtioner and added a leave in condtion to my hair and seal with agan oil and wrap hair up and let dry over night. My hair came out very soft, no breakage!</li>
    <li> I have relaxed my hair and bleached it twice and my hair was breaking horribly......I received Polymedic emergency re constructor which was not what I ordered the packaging of the product were not the same at all but it is a nexxus product and it is a 6 ounce bottle instead of 3 so I tried it and am so glad I recieved this....it worked better than I could hope for and i have 3 more ounces</li>
    <li> I usually use this product following the printed instructions and feel my hair get stronger (but it&#x27;s not THAT noticeable). I decided to follow FaireMaiden&#x27;s instructions because, well, what she was saying made a lot of sense. I bought the Conair hard bonnet dryer and sat under the dryer using Emergencee and the Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisture Deep Conditioning Treatment for 40 minutes each time. Now, I don&#x27;t know if my head was too close to the bonnet or if using HIGH heat was a bit much but I noticed that my hair was taking FOREVER to dry. That&#x27;s because it was gummy!!! When my hair finally dried, I saw a massive amount of split ends and breakage (which I did not have before) and freaked out! I immediately sprayed in a leave-in treatment and slathered on Nexxus ProMend Overnight Treatment to prevent any further breakage. I eventually realized my hair was a lot softer and stronger so at least it wasn&#x27;t brittle and breaking off but still...I am pretty bummed that my hair got damaged especially when the bonnet did NOT feel that hot at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone had a problem with too much heat during conditioning? I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair (even bleaching at times) for almost 20 years and have never had any issues with heat conditioning, so I&#x27;m wondering if it was the protein treatment + heat that caused the damage? My hair is dyed ombre dark blonde and I use a ceramic curling iron with heat protectant every day, wash + Humectress 2-3x per week). I usually just throw on a cap and let the heat from my scalp do it&#x27;s thing but decided to buy a hard bonnet for heat conditioning and ended up with damaged hair. MEH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone else seems to have no problems with FM&#x27;s instructions and I would like to continue repairing my hair so any comments are appreciated. Should I just use it on the lowest setting (sitting far away lol) or just eliminate the heat altogether? Scared of causing more damage :/</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realise my hair was lacking protein until i used this. I think this is great for restoring the strength to relaxed hair. I didn&#x27;t know it but relaxed hair requires a good balance moisture and protein in order to be healthy. If you have a great conditioning hair mask this is a great an inexpensive protein treatment. Shipping was fast so that was also awesome!</li>
    <li> One of the best products used to stop hair breakage and from falling out, specifically after bleaching your hair. It reconstructs your hair, leaving your hair shiny, soft and non-frizzy. Use it every two weeks for unbelievable results.&lt;br /&gt;This product used to come in a larger size and cost less.  Now it comes in a smaller size and costs more.  But, I am happy to be able to find it on Amazon. CVS, and Harmon Discount discontinued carrying this product. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been incredibly stupid with my hair this weekend and completely fried my hair thin with bleach! I used to have beautiful black hair, and now it&#x27;s blonde and to mush. I remember reading about Emergencee about a year ago when I first started experimenting with my hair and then I found it in a walgreens when I was looking for something to FIX my hair. I washed my hair in it just how the instructions tell me to, and I cannot believe the difference in my hair. It&#x27;s no longer breaking off and it just feels stronger after just one use. If only I had found this product sooner, I would use it all the time! Great product, unbelievable results. I definitely plan on using the product regularly.</li>
    <li> I fried my hair to bits straightening it. I had lumps like bird nests and couldn&#x27;t even brush it. I thought I would have to cut it all off but thankfully I found this product! Of course it didn&#x27;t completely repair my hair but its effects are miraculous. Also, this little bottle lasts awhile. Don&#x27;t know what I would have done without it. Thanks Nexxus!!!</li>
    <li> It seems like a very temporary fix.  Not sure if I like it or not.</li>
    <li> I have major breakage from years of highlights and this product does WONDERS, I recommend it to all my family and friends that have breakage issues. I only use it maybe twice a month and every time it still makes my hair so strong and smooth.</li>
    <li> I use this once every few months.  I have healthy strong hair so its not needed too often but some times I play with my hair and it gets a little worn out.  You have to realize that this is protein not a conditioner.  It will not add moisture to your hair.  Actually protein generally makes your hair feel dry because the purpose is to add a layer of protein to the hair strands to bulk it up and make it stronger and thicker.  You have to know your hair and whether you need moisture or if you need protein, or both.  If you color your hair and have it flat ironed or blown dry often you have damaged it and protein will help but you will need moisture as well.  Some people are sensitive to protein.  You have to know what YOUR hair needs.  I don&#x27;t shampoo after the Emergencee treatment only before and then I follow up with a deep condition.  My hair always feel silky and soft afterward and I also notice that when I do a wash and go and let my curls dry naturally, after the treatment my hair dries much quicker.  I assume this is because the protein now bonded to the strands does not allow as much water in so my hair is not as saturated with water.  Anyway, I highly recommend this product especially if you have thin weak hair or use chemical processes on it.  You can&#x27;t use it too much or the protein will actually damage your hair to the point of it breaking off.  This has never happened to me but like I said I only use it once every few months.  If you really need protein I would suggest no more than once a month once you get it in good condition.  Until then I think once a week is suggested.</li>
    <li> My hair was dry, thinning, tangled easily, split and shedding like crazy.  I was scared to use protein treatments in my hair because my hair is so dry.  My hairdresser recommended this product years ago - today I am kicking myself for not trying this product sooner.  After one use of Emergencee, my hair literally stopped breaking off and shedding, it is soft, shiny and the curls are well defined and smooth.  I should mention that I am a black woman and my hair is not chemically treated, is tightly coiled and baby fine (Type 4A).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone whose hair is in suffering from chemical or heat damage, or just in generally bad shape.  One important note: please follow the directions on the bottle and wash and condition your hair after using this product.  The first time I used Emergencee, the results were good but were excellent the second time as I used the Nexxus Humectress deep conditioning treatment (in the jar). Thanks Nexxus!!</li>
    <li> Great treatment for color treated natural hair!! I have used it a couple of times and it has strengthened my hair so much.I am African American woman with natural color treated hair and this product has been a godsend! Love it!</li>
    <li> My hair was EXTREMELY damaged to the point it was falling out of my head for months after I had a blow out at hair salon. Everywhere I&#x27;d go my hair would be all over. When I combed my hair the entire floor would have hair all over it and I&#x27;d have to vacuum after just combing it. Once, I used this product, my hair stopped falling out completely and it is healthier than it&#x27;s been in years! I plan to do a protein treatment now monthly. I&#x27;d also recommend using Nexxus Deep Conditioning Mask as well after this treatment.</li>
    <li> I have African American hair that is relaxed and colored. After my last coloring, my hair started breaking off very badly, so I turned to this product for help.&lt;br /&gt;I want to say that if used correctly your hair will look and feel amazing! This is a reconstructing treatment, not a deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product once, my hair was very healthy again! Shine , Bounce and NO BREAKAGE!&lt;br /&gt;I want to describe to you how I used it to help those in need of hair repair, because if used incorrectly, it will damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I shampooed with Pureology Essential Repairs Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;2. On damp hair put an ample amount of the Emergencee. (don&#x27;t try to detangle hair)&lt;br /&gt;3. Placing a plastic cap over my hair, I went under the dryer for 20min. (your hair might feel \\&quot;hard\\&quot; that means it&#x27;s working!)&lt;br /&gt;4. Rinse out the Emergencee and I conditioned with Pureology Essential Repairs Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;5. On damp hair, I add a few pumps of Keratin Coppola Complex Infusion Keratin Replenisher 1.7 oz and then added a few pumps of Redkins So Soft Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;6. Now I detangle and comb out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT, ONLY USE EMERGENCEE ONCE EVEYOTHER WEEK!!!&lt;br /&gt;Style anyway you want, I let my hair air dry then flat iron it with BabyBliss Nano Titanium Flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it! Your hair will look , feel and be healthy! Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hair stylist.&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;d had a perm my hair needed to be restored and strengthened.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s working just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it once a week. Going by my instructions form my hair dresser.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works well.  Of course Nexxus products have always been reliable.  It makes my hair feel thicker and stronger without fly aways.  I like it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a funny story: Groupon was offering a deal on a hair product. When I looked it up in Amazon it was the same price as Groupon and also the reviews were 3 stars... Then one of the reviewers mentioned Emergencee and I was curious...&lt;br /&gt;The reviews speak for themselves and I bought the product. Used it as FaireMaiden detailed instructed to and voila! My super-hyper-mega colored, dryed, ironed, brittle hair feels 100% fuller and better!!&lt;br /&gt;This was a wonderful discovery and I have to thank the guys who wrote their reviews for my new hair.&lt;br /&gt;And leave testimony of the effectiveness of Emergencee &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it only once, but it worked!</li>
    <li> My hair stopped breaking almost immediately. Follow directions and you should not have a problem. I used this with the Vitatress Biotin Shampoo. I will purchase the other Nexxus products,That The recommended use requires. In the meantime i used what i had.</li>
    <li> This product, if used properly (follow instructions) is the best hair product on the market in my opinion. My fine, thin, over processed, bleached out, frizzy hair was transformed into shiny, silky, healthy, moisturizer hair. Very important that you use only once oer week maximum... and shampoo first, use product for 1-2 minutes ONLY, rinse out and then shampoo again with a good moisturizing shampoo... Then follow up with a good moisturizing conditioner. It made a difference after just one use, but after the 2nd use, my hair was remarkable. I&#x27;ve never gotten compliments on my hair.... Now people always a notice how shiny and healthy may hair is. Thank you Nexxus!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every week for a month now and haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my hair. I will say the day that I use it my hair feels a little healthier so perhaps I just need to use it more.&lt;br /&gt;One tip - the directions tell you to shampoo your hair twice, once before application and once after. I don&#x27;t see the need to use shampoo before so what I do is wet my hair with a spray bottle so it&#x27;s damp and then put the product in, do some chores around the house and let it sit. After about 20mins I hop in the shower and shampoo it out. Seems to work, so save yourself some shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;The best way to describe this stuff is that it reminds me of egg whites.I&#x27;ll keep using it and update my review in a month.</li>
    <li> When your hair is really damaged, you put it in your hair and leave it in for at least an hour. Remember to deep condition your hair after. You will feel the difference. If your hair is nice and healthy, you won&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
    <li> My naturally dry hair was breaking from relaxer and using activator as moisturizer.  A no no together.  Emergencee made hair soft again. And I could comb it without hearing snap crackle and pop! of my hair breaking off.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t like it. Made my hair feel like straw and I didn&#x27;t notice it doing any type of &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34; repair. I returned the product I was so disappointed and I don&#x27;t usually do that.</li>
    <li> I usually do not leave comments on products, but this product is my favorite.  I use to get it at Walgreen but they stopped selling it for some reason.  Then I couldn&#x27;t find it on the internet anywhere because all outlets were out of it.  THIS STUFF WORKS WONDERS FOR MY HAIR.  I purchased four of them so I would not run out. If Nexxus stops making this a lot of people are going to be UPSET, including ME!!! I leave it in for 10 mins, followed by my conditioner. I receive so many compliments about my hair and I am American America with relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> I love this serum because it thickens my very thin hair and isn&#x27;t sticky.  It washes out and leaves great hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously amazing. Bit of background: I have dry, wavy/curly, shoulder-length hair, and I&#x27;ve just moved out of a house that had atrocious well water. I also color my hair. It&#x27;s been really dull, frizzy and damaged for a while, so I read reviews for this and figured I&#x27;d try it out. Here&#x27;s exactly how I used it:    First, I shampooed with my L&#x27;Oreal Everpure Moisturizing Shampoo. Then I put in about a quarter-sized amount of Emergencee in my hair and left it in for approximately 2 minutes, then rinsed with lukewarm water, as per the directions. Then I followed with a ton of L&#x27;Oreal Everpure Moisturizing Conditioner mixed with a decent amount of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Hair and Scalp Treatment (HIGHLY recommend), left on for about 5 minutes. Rinsed and blow-dried, and was completely amazed with the results.     It wasn&#x27;t until I straightened my hair that I saw just how markedly improved my hair is as a result of using Emergencee. It&#x27;s a lot shinier, and it feels like silk, so I can&#x27;t stop touching it. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens with continued use, since the results are so drastic after only one application.</li>
    <li> this stuff it amazing!  I have really long hair, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with breakage, but this makes my hair soft, shiny and cooperative.  It also helps with frizz caused by humidity, which is a constant in florida.</li>
    <li> I just finished using this product as FaireMaiden suggested in her review. IT IS AMAZING! I have relaxed hair and due to some health issues my hair has been shedding a lot lately. I noticed much less shedding this time around. I purchased this product because LA Hair stylist Kim Kimble recommended it. She knows her stuff and you will NOT be disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I have had severe trouble with breakage and this product is second to none. As soon as you wash it out you know something wonderful has just happened. I follow the directions exactly even though some people like to leave it on longer. I just don&#x27;t have the time and quite frankly I find it works great just following the directions. This product is truly amazing, however I still had some breakage, as I said my breakage was severe.&lt;br /&gt;I now use this once a week in conjunction with nexus overnight split end treatment and the kerafix conditioner followed by the leave in conditioner spray.&lt;br /&gt;Update. Although, a good product my breakage is so severe that it unfortunately is not my ultimate answer. For people with moderate or mild breakage this might be your answer.</li>
    <li> After I applied the treatment, my hair texture was very coarse and hard. This was not what I expected! Would not recommend for people to use whose hair type is not straight.</li>
    <li> This stuff make my platinum blonde hair baby soft, smooth &amp; sleek.  It really seems to restore all the damage that bleaching has done and prevents from being stiff and rough textured. My hair is naturally frizzy &amp; wavy and this calms it right down and makes it sleek. This is one of my biggest secrets and am afraid to let the cat out of the bag, lest everyone buy up all the product and none left for me.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time this past summer.  My hair was dry and brittle from highlights, sun and beach!..  A little actually goes a long way. I made sure to drench my hair and I covered it in plastic cap.  I sat under the hair dryer for 20min and then shampoo/cond like normal. OMG.. what a difference it made! My hair truly felt rejuvenated. I do this treatment every two months. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I HAD LOOKED FOR YEARS FOR SOMETHING TO KEEP MY HAIR FROM BREAKING WHEN I GET A PERM. I FINALLY READ REVIEWS ON AMAZON.COM ABOUT NEXXUS EMERGENCEE. I BOUGHT SOME AND TRIED IT. BY GEORGE IT WORKS. I STARTED CONDITIONING MY HAIR ABOUT THREE WEEKS BEFORE GETTING A PERM AND DIDNOT HAVE A BIT OF BREAKAGE.I USED IT TWICE A WEEK BEFORE A PERM BECAUSE MY HAIR WAS REALLY BAD TO BREAK AFTER A PERM.THANKS AMAZON FOR ALL THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and it gets ratty/damaged quickly. I have been using this product for several years now as it is the ONLY thing that works for me. In fact, I used it a couple of days ago to prep for my hair cut &amp; color appointment yesterday. The hair dresser asked how I get my hair so very  shiny:). My \\&quot;secret\\&quot; is that I first wash my hair, then I put on plenty of the Nexxus Emergencee treatment and leave it on for 5 minutes. Then I rinse and I DO NOT shampoo again (although the directions tell you to). Instead I take an overdose of a moisturizing conditioner and work it into the hair covering every strand thickly, leaving it in for a minute or two. Then rinse and I&#x27;m done. The first time I used it I had to do 2 treatments just like that, before my hair was really restored, now I do it monthly and only need one treatment. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a month or so and can not see much of a difference in my dry breaking brittle hair but I will give it more time!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, if hair is damaged and shedding-problem is fixed with first application, it continues with use to fortify and strengthen the hair.</li>
    <li> I have already recommended this product to several family members and a few co-workers. This product is best to make your hair stronger to endure any chemical process. I used this product in the past but I no longer see it in stores. Thanks for having it. My hair sure needed this fix. AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years. In the summer. when my hair is most damaged from the sun, and chlorine, I use it ever 2 weeks, the rest of the year once a month. It doesn&#x27;t smell great and has a weird texture but it really does stop breaking hair.</li>
    <li> When I got it originally in walgreens it worked wonders for my hair. But this time it sucked. it did nothing for my hair. I wonder if this is just a rip off where the packaging is right but the stuff inside isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This is a great restorative product for chemically treated hair!</li>
    <li> Has really helped with breakage on my fragile fine hair.  The only negative is that sometimes it leaves a gold cast on my pale blonde but the benefits are worth it.</li>
    <li> Use as directed for amazing results!!!  Best product for restoring all is says it will do!!!!</li>
    <li> Used this product one time and it works beautifully.  I did not use in the shower as indicated on the directions.  Used a towel to get the extra water out and then worked into my hair.  Left on for around 10-15 minutes and then rinsed it out.  Also used a conditioner after rinsing the conditioning treatment out.  Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Since I have starting using this product my hair has grown at least 6 inches and I get very little breakage.</li>
    <li> i bought this product 3 weeks ago and so far ive used it one and i dont know if its just me but ive seen a change so far. im caribbean, so i have ethnic hair, my hair is dry, course curly hair, but on the back of my hair is less curly (yea its really weird) anyway, ive relaxed my hair since i was 13 i guess (im 21) and it has grown a lot, passed my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; like 5 years ago i started to see that my hair was breaking everytime i brush it. i started to go to beaty salons and use flat iron almost every weekend, but my once beautiful hair started to get worse, more dry, more breakage, dull, and i was using hair treatments and they would tell me that they didnt know what it was then....i didnt know what to do so i cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yea i thought it was going to be the solution, i had a bob last year and then i got highlights on may and relaxed my hair on july... my hair just fall off!! a great part in the middle of my head... i stopped going to that salon and started to take care of my hair, i went online and type how to repair damaged hair and there were a list of good products and great reviews... so i said ok lets give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used to buy cheap conditioner so i decided to invest in my hair this time, thats how i found this product, i used last week and i can see a difference now, everytime i brush my hair i can see fewer hair now!!! thats a relief!!! im going to keep updating to share the results....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;along with this product im using ojon restorative hair treatment, fekkay cleaning shampoo (or i use soda with my shampoo its alsmot the same) and my hydrating shampoo. i use ojon firts, sometimes overnight, i shampoo with my hydrating shampoo and then use the emergencee for 40 minutes. then i use pureology hydracure intense moisture and i leave in chi silk infusion before styling and if im going to use heat i use john frieda full repair heat protectant... i know its a lot of products, thats why i use once a month my cleansingshampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i know its a lot!!! but i just want my hair back to how it was before.... i hope this review has helped someone thats passing through the same, ill keep updating every month...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so more than a year later I have my hair back to where it was, after using all the treatments my hair started growing really fast and my hair dresser kept triming my ends every time it went to the salon, to get rid of the damaged hair, until there was a point where there was only one four inches of damaged hair and the rest of my shoulder lenght hair was healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Resently I also got a keratin treatment as a way to tame my really curly hair with a healthy way. So far my hair seems shiny, I went to a different salon out of state and they told me that it looks healthy and has a natural shine to it, so I&#x27;m really happy with all the effort I did before. I still use heat protectant before I use heat tools and I haven&#x27;t colored my hair in almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product to anyone that has damaged hair, it really helped mine.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t appear to do anything for my hair, but it is very thin.....Not much else to say didn&#x27;t like it...</li>
    <li> I like this treatment so far. It doesn&#x27;t do anything spectacular but people say its the best so I feel kind of good when I use it. It does make my hair look shinier.</li>
    <li> This product works on all hair types and all races. After you wash your hair, apply an ample amount to your hair I allow it to stay on my hair for 10 minutes I sit under the dryer, then I rinse it out and wash my hair again, apply conditioner, rinse out the conditioner and style as usual. My hair is stronger since I have been using it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine thinnish blonde hair.  I had finally gotten in in pretty good condition, but the ends were a little dry so I decided to try this.  Used it per directions all over my hair.  Well, its about a month later and it RUINED my hair.  I have tried everything I know since short of cutting it all off to repair it.  My hair is dry and brittle from roots to ends now.  I DO NOT recommend this, at least for people with my hair type.  I so regret doing it.</li>
    <li> At last a product that really does something! I live in a very dry climate at 7,200 feet. Oh what that does to hair! With this product, my hair feels like it&#x27;s  lightly coated with a tough elastic- like covering that keeps it from breaking. Before, I could take a strand and break it with a slight pull. I can feel the difference now when I try and break a strand. This product makes my hair  thicker, silkier and just overall far better than it ever was. I am over 60 and have long hair, below my shoulders. I don&#x27;t believe older women need to cut their hair short and let it go grey. UGH! I now have thicker, black (thanks Nutrisse), shiny, beautiful hair. I think this is the best product in their line.</li>
    <li> I had not been able to find this product in the stores and I was so happy to find it on Amazon. Within 6 months of using it my hair got stronger. Now, two years later I have beautiful hair. My stylist reccommended it to me and I have been in love ever since. It&#x27;s great for all hair times. I have long thick African American Relaxed Hair.</li>
    <li> have used this product more years than I can count, it is AWESOME, follow the directions on the bottle, it is FABULOUS !</li>
    <li> This product is great and It met my expectations and more. It made my hair texture so much better and so much more softer.&lt;br /&gt;Theresa</li>
    <li> Stops falling hair especially after anesthesia. With the use of one bottle treatment hair stops shedding almost immediately.  May take two bottle for complete stop.</li>
    <li> I used it did not see a big change in my hair its an okay product but I might not purchase it again</li>
    <li> Emergencee saved my hair. I have very tight curls that were damages over the years from being dry, straightening, &amp;#34;sun in&amp;#34; ect. Once I used this product for a few months and trimmed my hair every few months most of the damage grew out. I still straighten my hair VERY often so this product is a must for me every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the bad reviews seem like they are coming from inexperienced people. This is a thick goopy product that you put on clean hair. I leave it on for about 20 minutes, then sometimes I shampoo it out sometimes I just rinse it out, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference. Then DEEP condition your hair with a moisturizing conditioner. Immediately after my curls are so much more bouncy and shiny. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I used it three times, once a week and I have seen a great improvement in my ends and less breaking.  I will continue to use it.  Its worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use this product once per month and I must say I am very please with it.  I have shoulder lenght relaxed color treated hair.  Once a month I prepoo (coat my hair with oil (Olive or Jamaican Black Castor oil)  and sit under the dryer for 30 minutes) then I clarify using a clarifying shampoo.  I then put the Emergencee in my hair for 2 minutes only.  I shampoo it out using a tablespoon of shampoo then I follow-up with a Deep Conditioner ( Alter Ego - Energizing Rebalancing Cream ) for about 1-2 hours (30 minutes if I don&#x27;t have time).  Then I rinse it out with a moisturizing conditioner, towel dry, moisturize and seal my hair(using a crean leave-in conditioner and a small amount of oil - light olive oil) air dry my hair and use flexi rods to style.  My experience has been good.  Breakage and shedding have stopped.</li>
    <li> After the worst hair disaster of my life (bleaching until it turned into noodle hair that practically fell out in clumps just by looking at it) this saved it. Yes, my hair is still dry as hell and half my hair is gone.. so I&#x27;m disturbingly thin haired at the moment. But I WILL say... this protein treatment, once a week for a couple weeks now has greatly diminished the hair loss, ended the &amp;#34;noodle effect&amp;#34; and my hair feels fuller than it did. Definitely. Will keep ordering!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff completely changed my hair. I have long, wavy/curly, and always frizzy hair. Having used this once a week for about a month and a half, I actually no longer need to use gobs of styling product after my shower! I now have bottles and bottles of various expensive smoothers and curl definers that I don&#x27;t need!</li>
    <li> This is my go to reconstructor when my hair becomes weak or starts to shed. It always works and stops damage after one use on any type of hair. I really recommend this product and hope Nexus brings this product back because it is a must have. One bottle usually lasts me a year and a little goes a long way. The consistency is similar to honey. I will continue to buy it as long as I can find it. It works great under a heat cap for 15+ minutes before rinsing out. The product should be used no more than every two weeks to repair damaged hair and then as needed to maintain healthy hair. Great for Natural Curly Hair too!</li>
    <li> Her step by step instructions on how to best use this product revived my dull, fragile, lifeless hair. And please! Use a deep conditioner after this treatment. I HIGHLY recommend [[ASIN:B003K5H2VM Deep Repair Masque ( For Dry, Damaged Hair ) - Macadamia Natural Oil - Hair Care - 250ml/8.5oz]].</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m confused as to what this product is supposed to do. I tried it once and it did not make my hair soft at all. and im assuming any benefit i did gain was from the deep conditioner i used afterwards. If you have normal damaged hair it would be better to spend your money on a deep conditioner instead. im giving it 3 stars because im not sure if i used it right..</li>
    <li> Awesome product very good for your hair .  it does exactly what the product says it will!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I&#x27;ve used it twice now, my hair is noticeably softer and heavier ( not heavier like greasier, but heavier like there are fewer wispy flyaways). Fyi, I&#x27;m 43, with long hair, it&#x27;s beginning to thin. This was the right product for me. I&#x27;m very pleased and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Use this product before and very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is better then other conditioners ive used. Leaves my hair feeling great, not dull. I look forward to trying other nexxus products</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve bought it 4 or 5 times now and it transforms my hair each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thin, fine hair and this pumps it up and makes me have a great hair day every time! I loved it so much, I got some for my mom too. Now she can&#x27;t live without it either.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of different restoring or volumizing hair products but this is the only one I have stuck with and will keep using.&lt;br /&gt;I shampoo my hair and then apply this instead of conditioner, I leave it on for a few minutes then rinse. It&#x27;s so easy to use and the results are great!</li>
