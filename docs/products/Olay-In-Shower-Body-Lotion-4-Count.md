<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great Product and price</li>
    <li> I use this every day and LOVE it! I swim every day and the chlorine plays havoc with your skin. This is a wonderful product but I can no longer find it in the stores in my area.</li>
    <li> This is the best deal-you put on in the shower, rinse, and you feel smooth all over!  No more lotion stains on your clothes!</li>
    <li> I have looked high and low for this product, and was THRILLED when I found it on Amazon. It&#x27;s the best and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an Olay fan since I can remember...I use their facial cream, shower gel, bar soap and so on.&lt;br /&gt;Not many beauty companies make In-Shower Body Lotion, so I haven&#x27;t try anyone&#x27;s else, but this one is so great for my extra dry skin... I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel after use.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it is getting harder and harder to find and use and this seller makes it easy!</li>
    <li> Ever since my wife introduced me to this product,[[ASIN:B001FB5NTG Olay Moisturinse In-Shower Body Lotion with shea butter, (15.2 Ounce) (Pack of 4)]]I have not showered without it.  I am one of those who has very dry skin, so I must replenish moisture. I just use several drops, wipe all over my body, as I rinse and I&#x27;m good to go for another 24 hours. There is no competing aroma. [[ASIN:B001FB5NTG Olay Moisturinse In-Shower Body Lotion with shea butter, (15.2 Ounce) (Pack of 4)]] comes with a unique upside down bottle, which hangs easily on the shower rack.</li>
    <li> After you wash body with soap, then you use this product.  Yeah it&#x27;s putting lotion on while in the shower, but it seems to absorb quicker then regular lotion, not so much rubbing in which makes it seem to be a quicker step in the morning.  There isn&#x27;t much of a scent.  And it&#x27;s hard to find at stores, so glad Amazon carries and can get with subscribe &amp; save.</li>
    <li> There is no better or easier to use moisturizer; winters can be harsh in New England and this product keeps my skin very smooth even during the dry winters.  I also enjoy using it in summer after sitting in the sun.  The price is very reasonable for the package of four.</li>
    <li> As someone who has always suffered with heat rashes under the excess belly skin by the thighs, this product has been a god send.  Too bad I have to buy it online because the stores stopped carrying it.  In shower body lotion is the best!!  Have not suffered from a rash since I began using this product several years ago.</li>
    <li> I love having a shower lotion to use.  Saves time in the morning when I am able to lotion up in the shower.  Plus this smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> I have ridiculously sensitive skin, and only through trial and error can I see if I&#x27;ll have an allergic reaction to a skin product. This worked for me for a few months before my body decided to break out in hives. This is no fault of the product. It worked lovely for the bit I was able to use it.</li>
    <li> I live in Minnesota and it is VERY dry here. This lotion really helps to keep my skin soft and and smooth. I do not suffer from dry skin when i use it.</li>
    <li> What a great product.  I use the lotion after every shower.  I don&#x27;t always rinse it off as instructions say to do.  Not greasy but does moisturize nicely.  And it&#x27;s such a time saver too.  With regular lotion, you have to dry off, then put regular lotion on, then let lotion dry before getting dressed.  With Olay&#x27;s in shower lotion, you shower, put the Olay lotion on while you are still wet, dry off and then get dressed.  It probably saves me 5 minutes after each shower.  That 5 minutes means I can do something else, like enjoy my morning coffee a bit longer or take more time with walking my dogs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I&#x27;m pleased. It doesn&#x27;t leave my legs super moisturized as if I&#x27;d used a body butter but it works pretty much the same as using a bath and body works lotion right after the shower. I&#x27;m so lazy about moisturizing yet have very dry and flaky skin so for whatever reason this is more convenient to do in the shower right before I turn off the water. I&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
    <li> I am too lazy to put on lotion everyday after I shower but somehow doing it in the shower is much easier! This keeps my skin moisturized in the dry winter and it has a very light but nice smell. It has also worked well on my pregnant belly which can sometimes be itchy. I would buy this in-shower lotion over regular lotion any day. Love it!</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and this is great for combating dry skin. I can&#x27;t not use it every time I shower because I can tell the difference when I don&#x27;t. I even have a subscription to ensure I don&#x27;t run out. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Helps moisturize dry skin.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for years.  Love being able to put it on in the shower.  A one-stop-shop.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Here in the midwest the humidity of the house gets down to about 15% despite the humidifier running all the time when the furnace is on. Cleard up my dry &amp;#34;alligator&amp;#34; skin in just a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Great for dry skin to get rid of the dry flakes on your socks.</li>
    <li> This is the best..No need to apply lotion after shower when you can apply in the shower. I love this</li>
    <li> Awesome product&lt;br /&gt;Oil of Olay rocks</li>
    <li> Was so happy to get this product.  Can&#x27;t find it anywhere I live.</li>
    <li> I love this it smells soooo good and the smell stays on for hours i would highly recommend this product 5☆☆☆☆☆</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. be clear that it is not a body wash, but a in-shower lotion. Use it everyday for soft moist skin.[[ASIN:B001FB5NTG Olay Moisturinse In-Shower Body Lotion with shea butter, (15.2 Ounce) (Pack of 4)]]</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price, hard to find in stores here so needless to say Amazon saves the day again.</li>
    <li> The in shower lotion is fantastic..I used to have flaky, itchy legs all winter, but since using this product it is non-existent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. Taking care of this chore in the shower is so much easier and I don&#x27;t feel greasy all over. Even in the coldest winter months in Philadelphia, my skin feels hydrated all day.</li>
    <li> Always my favorite. And I don&#x27;t have to make a trip to Walmart to get it. Always a plus!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I used it when I was pregnant the first time (and the second and third) and one week I ran out of it.  I thought, no big deal...  But it was.  I ended up getting stretch marks that started and when I bought more, there was minimal change in the stretch marks even though my stomach continued to get bigger!  I recommend this to all my friends having babies because I truly believe that it kept me from having more and worse stretch marks!!  It is also great for shaving!</li>
    <li> No Complaints, exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I could go on and on about this product, but the only thing that needs to be said is:  I LOVE IT!!!!  Been using this for years and hope to never have to be without it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product but can no longer find it on the shelves in our area so I went shopping on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found exactly what she wanted and purchased a four pack. Hope it lasts her a long time (but now we know where to find it).</li>
    <li> Love this product. Glad my local stores now carry this product. A must have if you have really dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only product we have found that keeps the dry cracking skin away during Winter time.  My wife gets dry skin so bad that her hands and feets crack and bleed.  She tried other products for years and nothing worked.  This does.  However it is getting more and more difficult to find on the local store shelves.</li>
    <li> The winter months are hell on my skin. Once I started using this body lotion almost daily,  the problems went away.</li>
    <li> after one use I can ALREADY feel and see a difference...not just in my skin (which is REALLY dry) but in my kids too...they take after me with dry skin and i put this on when they were in the bath...(had them stand up rubbedit on like i would normal lotion...rinsed it off and then dabbed them dry with their towels...smells great and leaves skin super soft!!</li>
    <li> Even in the dry winter air my skin feels fully moisturized without any lotion!  It is fast and easy to use in the shower.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I hate putting on lotion because it&#x27;s always greasy and frankly I don&#x27;t have time in the morning. But now I always have time! My skin is no longer dry and tired! Thanks OLAY! I do wish they would make other scents because I am not a huge fan of this one but it works so well I am used to it now! A must have for anyone with dry skin!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the ultimate in laziness and moisturizing. In the winter I usually follow up with an additional moisturizer, but it creates a nice first layer. And in summer it&#x27;s often the only thing I use!</li>
    <li> I have been using this body lotion for three winters. It is the only thing I have found to prevent my skin from itching when it is cold and the air lacks humidity.</li>
    <li> this is wonderful stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I use it year round and my skin stays soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product available.  Whether you live in the frozen tundra or the desert, this in-shower body lotion is the perfect way to end your daily bath.  I was introduced to the product when I lived in Central Ohio--during our long winters.  I never had cracked dry skin from the dry heat used during winter.  Now I live in Las Vegas and find it equally useful in the very dry desert.  Strangely, most stores don&#x27;t carry the product so I buy it in bulk on Amazon and keep it under my sink so I never run out.</li>
    <li> I love this product is so hard to find in local stores.</li>
    <li> The answer to your dry skin.  How many times do you say I&#x27;ll put on lotion when I get out of the shower, but then you don&#x27;t?  This takes care of that problem.  It keeps you smooth all year long.</li>
    <li> This is the best way to condition your skin and moisturize after shower, by applying the lotion while still in shower you are sealing in the moisture highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use it all four season long and it really keeps the skin supple and smooth. It takes the place of all of that other extra lotion after bath/shower.  It smells good and the price is good!</li>
    <li> Best Olay sin product ever. As with other Olay products, I am picky with the type/scent I want to purchase and started buying from Amazon after not finding this exact item in the store. Love the price and the convenience....and my hubby loves the smoothness and scent of it.</li>
    <li> These in shower moisturizers are the best for convenience!  I like the Olay brand of several products and this is a favorite.  The shea butter feels luxurious.  You get out of the shower with nice moisturized skin and a nice smell too!  After cleansing, all you do is rub on your &amp;#34;10000&amp;#34; body parts :) and then rinse off and exit.  There are many selection options too!</li>
    <li> Love this product and it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the only lotion of any kind that gives me relief from the dry skin I get every winter. I even use it on my hands after taking a shower. Rub on, rinse off. Easy as can be.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re lazy to put body lotion like me, you will find this in-shower body lotion really helpful and easy.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to use this product; but I love it! After you shower, you rub this all over your wet body. Wait a minute; then rinse it off. I have very dry skin and this really traps the moisure in.</li>
    <li> This is difficult to find where I live, so glad Amazon carry it. I use it everyday when I shower and it helps keep my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Olay for extra dry, which I can&#x27;t find anymore</li>
    <li> This goes into the skin so quickly and makes your skin so soft and smooth.  Highly recommend for those that have dry skin.</li>
    <li> This in shower body lotion has literally changed my skin. I have such dry and sensitive skin that if I don&#x27;t apply lotion the second I step out of the shower, I am dry and flaky and itchy all day long. My mom recommended this in shower body lotion years ago and I have never used lotion again. I panic when I can&#x27;t find it in stores so I was excited to see it sold in bulk (and wayyy cheaper) on Amazon!! The only slight negative that I would say about this is that I found you need to be sparse with this product on areas that are prone to breakouts. It is a thick product (it is lotion) so you will have a slight film but it just soaks in and is AMAZING!!! I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I like that thought of using it in the shower. It takes away the extra set up having to do lotion later in the day. It really does make my skin softer and I use it everyday. Takes about two minutes to put it on, leave it on a minute and rinse off. It can make the shower floor slippery over time, so be careful of that.</li>
    <li> I wish I could make everyone use this stuff. Its so much better and moisturizing than lotion after the shower. I am addicted.</li>
    <li> This product does an excellent job of re-hydrating old, tired, and estrogen-starved skin. Is a bit time consuming to apply and rinse off every time you shower, but well worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I can not survive without this in the shower. This is the cheapest price I could find anywhere.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this in the winter here in MO.  It&#x27;s a lifesaver when the air is so dry.  I stock up on this and will cry if they ever stop selling it!</li>
    <li> for my sisters.  I was a tester for this product before it came out and fell in love with it.  I love to put the lotion on in the shower and by the time I rinse, it&#x27;s a nice smooth finish on my skin.  Not oily or thick, but smells and feels great.  I&#x27;m trying to promote it so that Oley won&#x27;t discontinue it.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 years, the in-shower moisture is great.  Not greasy. When I don&#x27;t use it or run out, my skin becomes cracked and very dry.  This product is very difficult for me to find locally (NJ), So I order in bulk at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love Olay in shower lotion. I use to have really bad dry skin and nothing helped, I tried Olay in shower lotion and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since. I recommend this to anyone with itchy dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  So glad to find it on here they stopped carrying it in stores where I live! Keeps you hydrated all day.  Usually need to put on lotion before bed though</li>
    <li> I bought this one winter to help with some cold weather related dry skin, and now I can&#x27;t live without it. It&#x27;s so easy to just slather on a bit of lotion and then rinse off right before getting out of the shower, and my skin stay perfectly soft all day.</li>
    <li> Great love it. Also tried the purple one too.  Would love to get coupons for this product or any olay products for shower.</li>
    <li> This product makes moisturizing so much quicker and easier. I love the fragrance, and it works! I always keep a supply on hand.</li>
    <li> Living in the desert creates such dry skin for me but this makes my skin feel moisturized all day, everyday.</li>
    <li> I HATE HATE HATE putting on lotion after a shower. No matter what kind I get, it always feels super slimy and gross. As a result, in the winter I get horrible dry skin. I heard about this product and decided to try it. I&#x27;ve been using it when I shower, every other day, for about two weeks now and my skin is so soft! I still have to deal with the slimy feeling while I put it on, but then I rinse it off immediately. I don&#x27;t bother waiting for it to sit and soak. Both my husband and I have much softer skin and the itchiness from winter dryness was gone after the first use - even in the chafe-y areas! This has been a skin-saver! I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, but I prefer dealing with a neutral scent than slimy, nasty after-shower lotion or dry skin. Not gonna lie, if I&#x27;m in a huge rush I&#x27;ll even use it on my face (I don&#x27;t recommend doing that often, and NEVER if you have acne-prone skin - I don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t need this in the summer, but I definitely will be keeping it on hand through the winter months!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best stuff on earth!! Sometimes I&#x27;m in a rush and don&#x27;t have time to lotion up , this saves me. I&#x27;ve even let my 11 year old son use it. Great for People who are prone to dry and flaky skin. Leaves a soft lingering scent as well.</li>
    <li> i love this product i just take a shower like i normally would and then right before i get out i slather some on and rinse it lets me cover the whole body not just spots i dont have to worry about mistakingly getting it on my clothes or putting on to much and getting rite of the access or extra steps or time to get ready or for getting about it its in the shower next to the soap just abother min in the shower and im done it make everthing smooth and like i said i love this love this love this would deff. say buy it and you will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I have decided that I NEED to have this product in my life. I was shocked how well it worked and made my body feel even after the first use. My favorite part of this in shower body lotion is using it after I have shaved my legs. I get such dry and irritated skin so I apply a really thin layer (thats ALL you need) and I do not rush to rub lotion all over myself as soon as I dry off. Wish it came in a bottle with a pump- thats the only thing that could make it better. I am 5 months pregnant also and need all the moisture  I can get at this point to help prevent dry skin and STRETCH marks!!! I rub this on my ever growing belly and love how it feels- smells amazing too!!! I will continue to use this in my regular routine, especially when shaving, even after I am pregnant</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace older version and not thrilled with it.  With the old product, skin felt comfortable and soft to tough.  This new one my skin just feels greasy.</li>
    <li> Not really a stickler for body washes. Saw a well rated body wash and went for it. After using it my skin felt different, it felt good. Now I can tell there are differences in body washes. This one left me satisfied.</li>
    <li> I wanted to soften my skin.  At first I used too much of this,  but ended up using a lot less and having really positive results.  I found if I don&#x27;t rinse ALL this off, I like it more.  It&#x27;s easy to want to shower it all off.  Let it say and it&#x27;ll work better long term.</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer I have used!</li>
    <li> I got this product in a olay kit from a local grocer.  This product now has two formulas, the other has the old label with yellow and white as the primary colors.  Both are still like Nivea which has a base of water, petrolatum (vaseline) followed by more chemicals, fragrance and shea butter, probably less than 10%.  So, save yourself tens of dollars (or fives of dollars) and get the base ingredients for less than four dollars with tax.  Water and vaseline, and to be like olay, add a tiny amount of shea butter with a favorite scent, and voila! you have a similar olay creation. I found it not moisturizing in the long run.  After you rinse it off while showering, one would think, my skin is moisturized but then either you re-wash the body or dry off, that &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; you thought was there is no longer there.  I think this product is a waste of time because it doesn&#x27;t moisturize the way REAL moisturizers work.  This product has dimethicone which coats your skin like the petrolatum, so that means you skin doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; and the pores of your skin is coated and possibly blocked.  You&#x27;re better off bathing in soft water using real soaps with natural moisturizers (not commercial brands), exfoliate your skin, followed by an emollient oil or a blend of oils (olive oil, macadamia nut, walnut, etc.), and pat dry or dry then apply the oil.  Seal the oil with a good quality lotion or body butter(s) like shea, mango, and kokum.  Your skin will be softer.and actually moisturized.  Also, I challenge you consumers to research the ingredients of this product and their health risks and research the health risks of olive oil and the other oils I mentioned.  Be well and safe while you moisturize.  Olay, you&#x27;re not fooling me anymore.</li>
    <li> There is not a better product on the market!</li>
    <li> This is fantastic body lotion and because you apply it when you are wet, it really soaks in!</li>
    <li> Thia product was included in a gift basket at a time-share resort I stayed in. I didn&#x27;t know what it was, so I didn&#x27;t use it. After arriving home I gave it a try, and I have been hooked ever since. It is difficult to find, so it was a delight to see it on Amazon.com. I used to use it sparingly. Now I don&#x27;t have to. I use it on my dry legs, elbows and feet. It lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I was psyched that I found this on amazon and ordered it right away.  Came quickly and as described.  It, for me at least, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.  I go thru a bottle about once per week.  So I did some froogling and found it at a popular, nationwide pharmacy&#x27;s online site.  I won&#x27;t mention their name, but rhymes w/ball peen.  Let me say I got 8 bottles for the same price, free shipping, and razors and batteries for a few bucks more.  They have a promo running for 15 percent off, but still a great deal w/free shipping.  Anyways, love the product.  Goes on and washes off easily.  Scent isn&#x27;t overpowering.  And it does the trick.  I did find that if I don&#x27;t apply enough, rub in enough or rinse enough, I get itchy quickly.  Easily remedied by doing all 3 enough.  I do wish it was easier to dispense when it gets to the last lil bit, but I just take the lid off.  I use a great back lotion applicator I purchased a few years ago from amazon.  Easy peasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  just received my product from the other place and they are a smaller size than here-8.5 oz vs 15 oz.  But I still got a slightly better deal w/a code from that site to get 15 percent off n free shipping.  Plus, I might like the smaller bottles better.  We shall see.</li>
    <li> What should I say but I keep purchasing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them a lot and give them as gifts which are hit!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  There is no other product that is an in shower lotion.  After I have showered, I smooth on the body lotion and towel off.  My skin has never been smoother or more fragrant.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants softer, smoother skin.</li>
    <li> I put the lotion on after my shower and do no rinse it off.  My skin is usually very dry but after application, is soft for 2 days.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS! You put it on in the shower then rinse off after you&#x27;re finished. The first time I used this there was a great difference. I use it more in the winter when my skin looks like a crocodile&#x27;s. I use it twice (morning and evening). When you towel yourself when done in the shower there&#x27;s no excess and it doesn&#x27;t wipe away with the towel. My skin really does soak it up. No more scratching! I have bought them repeatedly for me and my mom who uses it every day even on a tropical island (PR) because the heat really does dry her skin.</li>
    <li> great price.. really like the way it leaves my skin soft and smooth.. hubby likes the scent... i would recommend</li>
    <li> This wonderful, under-appreciated product is a life-saver for dry skin sufferers -- and a huge timesaver, too (because it&#x27;s much quicker to slide on lotion in the shower while still wet).  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in retail stores, so I hope Amazon keeps carrying it!  Has a lovely scent, also.</li>
    <li> Absolutely solves your dry skin problems.  In the dead of winter when your legs look like they have dandruff, try this.  After one use you won&#x27;t believe your eyes or the feel of your skin.  Use every other day in the winter and you won&#x27;t have anymore dry, flaky skin!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff a lot and it is very convenient.  It does not have too much of a scent so that works well for me.  I can&#x27;t handle most scents.  The container itself has a shimmer on it but this lotion is the non-shimmery version.  Also works well for me. All being said, it is very good stuff but not for very dry skin.  I need to apply a little extra moisturizer to my hands and feet for the complete package.</li>
    <li> this cold dry winter this ALONG with moisturizer works great to keep your skin from drying out&lt;br /&gt;could not be without it.</li>
    <li> I love this Olay Moisturinse in-Shower body lotion so much i buy it all time at other store,but now i will be buying it on amazon they sell it for a great price 5+++++</li>
    <li> I love this for shower use.  I can&#x27;t find it locally so I appreciate being able to get it from Amazon Subscribe and Save program.</li>
    <li> I had used it before ,  my store had run out and I really wanted again it really works it keeps my skin soft , I can put it on in the shower and I can go all day without having to put more lotion .</li>
    <li> I really love this because I don&#x27;t like getting out of the shower and slathering on cold lotion, especially in the winter. This is so easy, I put it on at the end of my shower, rinse off and my skin is moisturized all day long, no dry flakey skin for me.</li>
    <li> I use this product throughout the entire year but I could not survive the winter without it.  I have very dry skin that becomes very itchy during the cold winter months and this product is a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It works well even if you rinse it off immediately after applying, and it&#x27;s obviously even better if you can let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing. I have normal skin, and using this lotion exclusively has kept me moisturized and eliminated the chalky skin of Northeast winters. If you have excessively or chronically dry skin then I&#x27;m not sure this would be a replacement for applying a regular, more oily lotion that takes several minutes to sink into your skin, but for the vast majority of people the convenience of slapping this on in the shower can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It goes on and rinses off just like soap but, it moisturizes your skin better than any lotion.  The moisture lasts all day and it&#x27;s not at all sticky.  The only down side is, you have to be careful because it will make the shower floor slippery.</li>
    <li> Great fast shipping. Item exactly as described.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT IN-SHOWER BODY LOTION FOR DRY SKIN...WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WITH SEVERE DRY SKIN...VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This light moisturizer leaves my skin feeling wonderful after a shower.  It also allows me to skip the &amp;#34;slather my body with lotion&amp;#34; bath step.  No residue on towels.  Like this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but can no longer find it in stores.  It works with the humidity of the water in the shower and it eliminates one more thing I have to do when getting ready for the day.  Glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the best product. I do water exercise 4 times a week and my skin feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Use this to shave my legs and it works great. Keeps me nice, smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This is the best EVER. It smells great, leaves your skin silky,soft,and RADIANT. BEST of all is is very affordable. No need for lotion after a shower, this is by far the product to use. AWAY with the old, in with OLAY in shower body lotion w/ shea butter. For best results use with matching body wash. ODER IT NOW!!! THANKS AMAZON. {my convenient shopping mall.}</li>
    <li> It is the best way to use lotion and does not leave a slick, oily feeling.  Leaves skin smooth and works great on feet also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Best body lotion on the market!</li>
    <li> I find this product pretty much indispensible. Especially when its cold out, I love being able to moisturize right in the shower.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully in the shower on dry skin.  Use it everyday.  Can&#x27;t stand my skin  without it!  The best I have found!</li>
    <li> i  use this because i don&#x27;t like the feel of body lotion put on after a shower.  i use this all the time, and the amazon price for the 4-pack is comparable to buying it in the store. there are only two department stores i have found that sell it here in southeastern connecticut, so buying it on amazon is really convenient.</li>
    <li> Works great! I was worried my shower would be very slippery but it was not. Noticed a difference after only one use.</li>
    <li> Things I like about this body lotion:&lt;br /&gt;The smell! Yes the smell! It is neither strong nor cheap, more like a relieving lily smell after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;Ideal for dry skin during winter.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply. Yes, no need to say more. I really like the way it is applied in shower rather than standing cold applying ordinary body lotion after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The large tube. Yes trust me one tube is enough for a whole winter even if you use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like about this lotion:&lt;br /&gt;It does make the batch tub greasy after a while.&lt;br /&gt;There might be more skin flakes - which means you have to use the scrub more often.&lt;br /&gt;The large tube. Yes you know sometimes it can quite frustrating to find out that there is still a bottom left after a whole winter.&lt;br /&gt;(OK. The last one is a joke. Keep making such good stuffs in large tube, alright? I love you P&amp;G!)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this scent and love the product in general. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a very unique product that truly WORKS! I have been using this product religiously every single time I shower, for 9 years now. I love it! It is just like it advertises - use it just as you would use conditioner on your hair, but instead it is for your skin. It takes an extra two minutes at the very end of your shower to slather it on neck to toe, let the steam and heat from the shower work it into your skin for about a minute, rinse off, and you step out feeling like your skin is spun of pure silk. I tend to have pretty dry skin and this has done wonders for me. It completely replaces having to use any kind of body lotion after bathing. And it smells wonderful and clean. The one and only downside is that it leaves the bathtub feeling oily and slick after just one use, so be prepared to break out the Ajax and clean the tub frequently. But it&#x27;s so worth the tub cleaning. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the ultimate skeptic, but I love that I KNOW this product works. I know because my bathroom is freezing cold (we hope to get radiant floors when we win the lottery).  But when I get out of the shower with this moisturizer on, I don&#x27;t feel the cold. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m covered in a layer of something that is blocking the air from getting at my skin. (It makes me wonder if that&#x27;s a problem since skin needs to breath, but I&#x27;m not that worried.) This is a cool product! Only bad thing - I don&#x27;t put that much on but I used it up in just a few weeks. Hubby must be using it too. I&#x27;m buying again and will use more sparingly.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  it helps with my dry skin and feels so good in the shower!  I wish I could find it in a store.  would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have been using this in-shower lotion for about 4 years and I could not get through a winter in the Midwest without it now!  I have very dry, itchy skin on my legs, arms and stomach in the winter and this lotion completely relieves it.  You wash as normal, then put a little in your hand and smooth it over all the dry areas, then just rinse and pat dry!  It is much more convenient than putting on lotion after you get out of the shower!  I have a hard time finding this in stores now, but am glad it is available here on Amazon.  Please Olay, do NOT stop making this product!  It is a life saver and I have introduced many other people to it and they all love it too.</li>
    <li> My skin is only itchy in the winter when the humidity is low.  Olay In-Shower Body Lotion is the only thing that keeps me from itching constantly.  I can&#x27;t find in stores anymore, so I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  I might have to buy more and hoard it for future winters.</li>
    <li> It is a bit strange to put lotion on in the bath, and it is a bit thick so in some ways it feels like lotion, but I love the how moisturized my skin feels after. The trick is to avoid the urge to wipe it off after you get out the shower, if you just blot dry and let it dry you will feel great afterwards. What I love about it the most is that I don&#x27;t feel that greesy, oily feeling that i get from body washes or traditional lotions...i hate that greesy feeling. WIth this product it feels like it just gets absorbed! I don&#x27;t know how else to explain it :)</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay in shower body lotion for over 8 years. It is the most effective way to moisturize I have found. I don&#x27;t know about you but I don&#x27;t many times have the time to rub after shower moisture lotion all over my body and wait til it is absorbed to get dressed. This is 1-2-3-4...cleanse, rinse, use olay in the shower while still wet ( best way to moisturize ) rinse and towel off. I am always complimented on how soft my skin is. This is my secret. Olay used to distribute this in grocery stores, Target, Walmart...for some reason it has disappeared from the shelves so Amazon answers my needs and I buy in bulk so I never run out.&lt;br /&gt;Carole</li>
    <li> The only way my skin stays soft in the winter.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I love all of Olay products, I wish that I could find the serum cheaper. This keeps your skin so hydragated ans soft. You also smell really nice!!</li>
    <li> The product is ok. Other reviewers seemed more enthusiastic. I&#x27;ve seen it advertised in single bottles elsewhere after I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. Very convenient and leaves skin very nice feeling.</li>
    <li> I like that I can have the benefits of lotion without that sticky wait til you dry to put your clothes on feeling.</li>
    <li> I was expecting better results.</li>
    <li> Unique, incredible product that has turned me into a daily moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin from drying out. Love it only wish it came in a larger size</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  Saves time in the morning and works great for my very dry skin. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere.  So glad I can find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin.  But with the in shower, it&#x27;s baby soft and smooth.  Love it.  Love it.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I take 2-3 showers a day. One in the morning before my 5:30am workout, one after my workout and sometimes another in the evening if I when for an afternoon run. Having dry and sensitive skin, apply a lotion all over my body after each shower was impossible, especially since I could not reach my entire back. Also, the amount of time it would take, I don&#x27;t have. I use this after at least one shower and it is awesome. I feel all silky smooth when I get out of the shower, not slimy, and I don&#x27;t have to deal with the itching of my skin the rest of the day. If I take another shower later in the day, most of the time I don&#x27;t have to reapply it again unless I scrub really hard. Oh and it is great after shaving the legs!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first.  I&#x27;m just a guy who always forgets to put on lotion or is in a rush, so when I do put on lotion I just feel greasy, and that &amp;#34;just out of the shower feel&amp;#34; last all the way to work and by then I just feel like I need to shower again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff makes my skin feel great, it does leave you a little shiny but your skin feels moisturized (And it&#x27;s not a greasy shiny, just bright, healthy looking skin). Plus you put it on while your in the shower which makes it seem like less of a hassle...No having to dry off, no waiting, just put it on and rinse off and dry yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this to anyone who has Dry skin, or just anyone who needs a good lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is dull, you hardly notice it, but when you do it is nice. (everyone&#x27;s skin is different though, it may be stronger on others, but for me it&#x27;s just a clean light smell that any cologne or deodorant overpowers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this for my skin. I use it regularly, therefore I don&#x27;t require lotion anymore.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Might be ok for some, but the product did not clean nor moisturize well for my skin type - left an oily feeling</li>
    <li> I first used this as the directions said, but got tired of cleaning the shower.  Then I moved on to showering, getting out of shower, putting lotion on, then patting dry.  Still didn&#x27;t like that.  So...now I shower, dry off, and use as regular lotion.  It keeps my skin so soft until the next shower!  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  P.S.  Love to use it as a hand lotion after doing dishes, cleaning, and before going to bed.  Its amazing!</li>
    <li> I love it!!! No need to put body lotion after during the day.</li>
    <li> great product; swiftly delivered.</li>
    <li> Move over Lush &amp; Nivea. Olay has beat you at your own game &amp; the 4 pack price, can&#x27;t beat it. My honey loves how smooth &amp; soft my skin is. It smells amazing too. No overpowering smell, plus... It last a while! I love it best invention...</li>
    <li> I use in the shower. Keeps skin nice and soft. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel like baby oil or lotions.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that is difficult to find in local stores, thankful that Amazon offers it!  This is an easy alternative to moisturizing after bathing....just apply it and rinse off!  Great and fresh scent!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Not to heavy, not slick in the tub, and keeps the dry winter skin away.</li>
    <li> I thought I had bought some shower soap with a coupon a few years ago only to find out in the shower that it was NOT a soap at all.  But what it was - was a very unique way of keeping your body moisturized, seems to lock it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has psoriasis and loves this stuff (he&#x27;s 61, I&#x27;m 48).  His skin used to be so, so flaky (like me? ha ha) but this stuff has really toned that down and doesn&#x27;t make him smell like a woman or anything.  I am disabled but get to the pool for aquatherapy so my skin also gets quite dry... This stuff is a skin-saver for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I made the mistake of buying it in the first place.... One of the better mistakes I&#x27;ve made in my life.</li>
    <li> the best way to moisturize your entire body without a partner to lotion your back! doesn&#x27;t make tub slippery as other types did</li>
    <li> this maybe the 2nd time i write a review on this, but this is the best thing i found for my extra dry skin.</li>
    <li> love this stuff it isn&#x27;t real oily or grease and leaves my skin soft.  My husband says my skin is softer,:)</li>
    <li> This is alright, I bought it by mistake....LOL thought it was body wash....that&#x27;s what I get for being in a hurry.  I myself just don&#x27;t feel the need to buy something to put on, just to wash off...  Does it make my skin soft yes!</li>
    <li> I happened upon a bottle of this at CVS one day (and there was only ONE bottle of it in the entire store) and decided to try it. I have very dry skin in the winter that constantly feels tight and itchy. I also tend to get \\&quot;rashes\\&quot; of dry, flakey skin (mostly my arms). Well, I tried the Olay stuff and loved it. When I sought out my next bottle, I found that the few stores in SE Michigan that actually carry this apparently don&#x27;t like (or refuse) to keep it in stock. I managed to acquire another bottle but subsequent attempts to keep my dry skin at bay were completely foiled - until I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: the shea butter formula is rich but not greasy; it moisturizes but does not feel overly heavy; it smells nice but doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming fragrance and won&#x27;t overpower your own favorite perfume. If you have cracked heels or especially rough elbows, however, you will still need a heavy duty moisturizer for those areas. In short, I&#x27;ve lost the itchiness &amp; flakiness and my skin stays soft &amp; nicely moisturized throughout the day. Even my husband noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> Once the weather gets cold and the heat is on in the house, I have found this is the only way to keep my skin from drying out.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but one of the bottles was leaking and it got everywhere.</li>
    <li> My skin is so dry, I skip the rinse off portion and my skin drinks it right up with no greasy/oily after feel.</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with itchy winter dry skin.  This really seams to help, putting it on in the shower holds the moisture in.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Once you use the in shower lotion you really don&#x27;t have to apply lotion once out of the shower. If you suffer from dry skin this product will definetly help you.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great to use after you shave!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and this is the only way I can get it since I can&#x27;t find it in any stores... I stocked up!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. I hate getting out of the shower and having to apply lotion. Although, this lotion doesnt allow you to skip that extra step, applying lotion, i find it less annoying to apply it while im in the shower, it goes on more easily.&lt;br /&gt;I dont know, i think clean me is less lazy than clean and dry me.</li>
    <li> As someone else wrote, this is like putting on conditioner for your skin.  Perfect if you&#x27;re putting on skinny jeans after your shower and you don&#x27;t want them to get slimy.  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon added it as a subscribe and save because it&#x27;s a pain to find in stores!</li>
    <li> The scent is intoxicating! I am addicted to this product....never before has taking a shower been such a sensory experience for me! I love love love the softness of my skin afterwards! Replacing your moisturizer isnt advised but it is definitley  the perfect additive to your beauty regime.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  I love the idea of getting the moisturizer taken care of in the shower and being done with it but it left the shower floor too slippery.  Might be my shower floor - don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I used to be able to get it locally but it seems to have disappeared.  I will buy it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me and I love it.  It does not leave my skin greasy, but does leave it feeling moisturized.  I still have to use my body lotion but it lasts all day using both.  It is great for my back - I put a bit on the top of my back and when it rinses off, it moisturizes the part of my back that is just too hard to reach with lotion.  The Amazon price was cheaper than even Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay Moisture In-Shower for a long time.  I have a really hard time finding it where I live and the only place I can find it is out of my way to go get.  It&#x27;s wonderful in the winter and summer both - the scent is soft and very nice.</li>
    <li> simple to apply at end of shower,no need to apply lotion and feel greasy,helps keep skin from feeling dry and itchy</li>
    <li> No slippery shower and this product has eliminated expensive dry skin creams from my life.  I have put this product on a ship automatically status because I am so happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have very, very dry skin so going without lotion is just not an option. Being able to apply this in the shower while my conditioner soaks into my hair has drastically shortened my morning routine. My skin is soft, and the fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering, so I&#x27;m quite happy.</li>
    <li> I am 60+ and need extra moisturizer for my skin.  If I use this in the shower and don&#x27;t have to lotion up afterwards!  Love it! Love it!</li>
    <li> Does not moisturize my feet well, an make the shower slippery.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this product home from the USA and introduction me to this product and I can not get it in Australia and I was please to see in in your store. I have dry feet problems and this help to keep them moist.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff I have used it for years, my skin is addicted to it! It is not always easy to find so I was excited when I found it on Amazon! I buy it 6 at a time and it last me about 6 mos. And that is using every day! I LOVE THIS IN SHOWER LOTION.</li>
    <li> I never look forward to winter and one of many reasons is my skin becomes so dry and itchy that I scratch until my skin is red and raw. I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products trying to find relief and the combination of Olay In-Shower Body Lotion and then Neutrogena Body Oil immediately after showering is the best remedy I have found. Itching is not relieved 100%, but it certainly works much better than anything else I have found and this helps me make it through cold winter months.</li>
    <li> I really love this in-shower body lotion.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years &amp; it keeps my body nice &amp; soft.  I wish they sold this in BJ&#x27;S here in Phila..</li>
    <li> I can NOT find this product at Walmart, Target, the supermarket, or drug stores for some reason. This stuff is great. I love to use it after I shave. Just smooth it on, and then I let it sit for a few. It smells great and rinses off easily, but leaves your skin moisturized. Great for those who are in a rush and don&#x27;t have time to use lotion after the shower.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion to use in the shower and keeps your skin so soft, especially if live somewhere where the climiate is so dry. Great service and great product.</li>
    <li> The first thing that comes to mind when I think of reviewing this product is: luxurious.  It smooths on easily and quickly at the end of a shower.  Then a quick rinse, a pat dry, and dry skin is gone.  It smells delightful.  The only thing I would say as a &amp;#34;heads up&amp;#34; is that the product really traps in body heat for the first few minutes.  So, the bathroom feels exceptionally toasty immediately after application.  In the winter, that is WELCOMED.  In the summer, just open the door and let the steam out of the shower quicker :)</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin like mine you need an outstanding lotion. This will work. My dermatologist was suprised at the result.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find locally at any price so Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husand and I use this product. I could not find it locally so I bought on Amazon. Great for moisturizing right in the shower.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this in shower body lotion.  You just lather it on in the shower and rinse.  Voila done!  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores now but I love that I can still get it on Amazon.  YAY!  :)</li>
    <li> Why Olay doesn&#x27;t advertise this product I will never understand. You won&#x27;t have dry, itchy skin all year long. I give it to all my friends. This is Olays hidden gem.</li>
    <li> I am soo thrilled to find [[ASIN:B001FB5NTG Olay Moisturinse In-Shower Body Lotion w/ shea butter, 15.2 Ounce (Pack of 4)]].  I have not been able to find it in stores for at least the last 3 years and I just figured something else I really liked had been discontinued.  It really helps my dry skin in the winter.  I HATE putting lotion on after my shower and this makes moisturizing fast and convenient.  It will make the shower slippery, so you do need to be careful.  I am very happy to have found that I can still purchase it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. Lotioning in the shower saves me time, and is so much cozier then applying lotion afterwards when it&#x27;s cold in the house.</li>
    <li> This is an absolute must have. It leaves me smelling pleasantly nice and feels like velvet moisture on my skin. I use this all year round amd especially during the winter.</li>
    <li> I even recommended it to my dermatologist! It&#x27;s very effective and very easy to use.  I use it no matter the season.  I have recommended it to many friends.</li>
    <li> What a great idea to maintain hydration.&lt;br /&gt;The one, two punch of body wash and body lotion keeps ones skin groovy soft.</li>
    <li> Easy way to keep after dry skin.  In winter you sometimes may need to use something more substantial as well.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Looked for it in the stores, and coudln&#x27;t find it.  Used to use it for winter dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a MUST have for itchy pregnancy skin!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! Some people think the formula is too thick but it needs to be in order to penetrate your skin in the shower. I think it is super effective and convenient. I currently live in Colorado and I think it helps my skin stay smooth without the extra need for other body lotions when I do not have the time after I hop out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Makes me feel nice and refreshed after i step out of the shower, like my skin is just rejuvenated and i can hear birds singing and theres butterflies and the sun kisses my face, all as i step out of my hot steamy shower. Facegasim every time. No Homo.</li>
    <li> I have used this In-shower body lotion since it was first introduced, and it is wonderful.  It is so easy and quick to apply in the shower, much easier than regular lotion after a shower.  It leaves my skin smooth and prevents dry skin itch.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the in-shower body lotion. People always comment how great I smell and how smooth my skin is. Great for when travelling to a sunny destination to put some moisture back into your skin.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from itchy skin in the winter.  Easy to apply and can use a fairly small amount to apply to the whole body.  One bottle lasts me at least 6 months.</li>
    <li> It does what it promises.  My skin is very dry  and when using this product daily in the shower, my skin is soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few years and wouldn&#x27;t consider using any other moisturizer.  Did I mention how good it smells?</li>
    <li> As a diabetic I find it hard to keep my skin moisturized.Easy to apply, last a long time, smells great.</li>
    <li> My skin was so dry this past winter.  This was a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to continue to use it again this season.</li>
    <li> Love it super soft skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in-shower body lotion for years and love it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this product.  It works well and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Cant seem to find this item in any of the local stores--Wal Mart, Meijers, Kmart, rite Aid.  I have looked and looked.  I use this stuff faithfully in both Summer and winter.  Summer to keep your tan looking soft and smooth longer,, Winter for itchy, dry skin.  Excelllent product because Ihate putting lotion all over after shower. This way you take care of it all in the shower.  And my boyfriend loves my smooth, sliky body!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and the only place I can buy it is on Amazon.  Leaves my skin soft and I don&#x27;t have another step after I dry off from the shower. Another great aspect- it is much easier to moisturize you back. Hope it&#x27;s never discontinued</li>
    <li> AWESOME, i&#x27;ve always been lazy to put lotion on after shower but by using this, I feel so much more refreshed and my skin is so much smoother. I can totally notice the difference with and without this!</li>
    <li> Has made a big difference in my skin since I started using it thank you Oil of Olay  for thinking of something that really works</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this moisturizer!  My local drugstores have stopped carrying it......guess not enough people discovered it.  So I order it on-line-  It locks in the moisture from bath or shower and lasts all day.  It is especially good for ethnic skin, which can get &#x27;ashy&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected!!!</li>
    <li> During the winter months this shower lotion is a MUST!  I always buy several to give as gifts for Christmas while keeping one back for myself!</li>
    <li> This stuff is smazing!</li>
    <li> I had bought this at Target a few months back, tried it and loved it.  When I ran out I went to buy some more and they no longer carried it.  I found it here and ordered it and it came within days.  It works great and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Let me first admit that I am addicted to using lotion.  I use it all day everyday.&lt;br /&gt;We have hard water and the dry winter air is murder on my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using the in shower lotion for a few years now.  It is AMAZING!  It is not oily at all.  And actually keeps my skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so good, that even my husband (who is for some reason very anti-lotion) uses it.  It&#x27;s also gentle enough that I can use it on my kids (who have sensitive skin).  The extra moisture really does help my son manage his ecxema too.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely wonderful. I can not find it in stores anymore. I was so grateful to find the product in quality and in quanty because of the scarcity of this product. Thank you. The product itself is fantastic. I used while I was overseas. I got it in a care package and I was instantly hooked. This product will keep you silky soft for that special someone and keep you from being so dry in the winder or in a desert.</li>
    <li> Keeps me moisturized but not greasy year round. This works well for my dry skin but doesn&#x27;t make my shower floor slick. If I skip a day I can tell a difference as my skin is flaky and uncomfortable.  I&#x27;m so glad I have found this!</li>
    <li> I would not take a shower without using the rinse off body lotion...this size is a very good price and i like all the scents</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like using a moisturizer -- but you use it while you&#x27;re still in the shower.  Great  -- you&#x27;ll like it if you try it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this in-shower moisturizer for a couple of years and really like it.  It is very convenient and easy to use and during the summer months it is the only moisturizer I need.  During the winter my skin really dries out so I use this but sometimes apply another moisturizing lotion (giving me a little extra protection from the winter itching skin).</li>
    <li> Oil of Olay got it right with this product.  Anyone with dry or sensitive skin will benefit! Ever since this has come out, it has been harder and harder to find in retail stores. I always make sure I have more before I run out, and Amazon never disappoints.  The smell is great and it makes my skin feel better after the shower. My mom and sister have gotten hooked as well! I am not a big product person, but I highly recommend!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff, ever!  It never feels greasy or as if the moisture hasn&#x27;t been absorbed by your skin.  It has a lovely fragrance that is not overpowering or harsh.  I hope they never stop making this wonderful product.  However,  it is virtually impossible to find in stores anymore.  Fortunately, it is still available online  through Amazon and a few other outlets.  The price is very reasonable and, through Amazon, delivery is prompt.  Thanks for continuing to carry this great product.</li>
    <li> I use the Olay In-Shower Body Lotion daily in the shower and it helps my skin to stay moisturized without being sticky or too strong smelling. I hate getting out of the shower, lotioning up, then trying to put clothes on over the sticky mess. I also do not like strong smelling lotions so this works perfect for me. I slather it on in the shower, rinse, dry my skin, and immediately get dressed without a problem and my skin is smooth and moisturized!</li>
    <li> I love this in shower body lotion because I absolutely hate putting on lotion after shower, but have very dry skin. With this you just rub some on in the shower and then pat dry.  I used this years ago and have been looking for this in stores lately, but have been unable to find it. Love Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for years. It is becoming increasingly more difficult to find on store shelves. It&#x27;s the best way to moisturizer your entire body in just a minute. Rich, creamy and fast, I&#x27;m glad I found this available on Amazon. An order contains 4 bottles and I ordered 4 more for a friend and received free shipping. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the advice of all the five star reviewers.  I had what is called a &amp;#34;winter itch&amp;#34;. During the summer my lower legs are fine and do not itch. But during the winter, my lower legs and ankles start to itch as dry weather sets in.  I try not to itch them but actions of my socks, pants and sheets stimulate the itching.  I was looking far a body wash and this product came up. I ordered it and tried it out.  From its first use, the itch was gone for over 24 hours (in time for next shower).  Since I first used it two weeks ago, my ankles have been completely itch free. Even the little rough spots that were the center of the itches are gone. What a great product. After all the prescription ointments i have tried, this product did the trick. My &amp;#34;winter itch&amp;#34; is gone!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have dry skin all year long so this product is a Godsend.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion every day it makes my skin so soft and smells good to. I am so glad I found it on amazon. I was buying it at wal mart for about the same price but they were out of it some times. Now I have a whole case that will last me a long time. I am thinking it will last me about 4-6 months.</li>
    <li> This is great for me- I need moisturizer (in the winter especially) but know I won&#x27;t take that extra step after showering. This is great, you just put it on in the shower after the soap, and rinse off the excess. No ashy winter skin, and very little extra effort. I&#x27;m surprised they haven&#x27;t come up with a version targeted at men, because we&#x27;re the ones who would appreciate this. This came in a four-pack, which was a great value.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product &amp; buy 4 at a time cause I refuse to run out.  Wow, what a difference &amp; time saver.....soft, good clean smelling skin &amp; no need to apply any more lotion after showering.  No staining on towels or clothes or a slippery shower after use.  Does not irritate my sensitive skin or burn freshly shaved areas.  I use from the neck down daily.  Do not get it in your hair though because it will flatten it (super soft &amp; shiny though!)  I even use on psoriasis area &amp; that has noticeable good results &amp; no negatives.  I prefer this over Philosophy and love the cheap price in comparison.  And yes, I rinse after using as directed.  Even my winter cuticles look better!!  BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I bought initially at Target, but not a lot of places carry this. After 2 uses, skin felt 10 x better. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> My review is not going to add any new info to the 270 5-star reviews already posted, but I can&#x27;t help doing a little raving myself. I have never used body lotions or hand lotions. Hate the feel of rubbing them in, and of my skin afterwards. OK, I am lazy, too. However, meds or age or something started making my skin dry and itchy, so I decided to try this in-shower moisturizer. In the past, if someone gave me a moisturizer, I would use it in much the same way as this product. -- slather on in the shower, then rinse. It would help, but not a great deal since most of the product was rinsed off before absorption. However this product is lovely! Easy to apply over a moist body, quickly absorbs so skin is noticeably softer when rinsed and after drying. I always buy several bottles so I won&#x27;t be without.</li>
    <li> What a great idea - lotion in the shower !  Love it  It&#x27;s amazing how soft my skin is but not greasy !</li>
    <li> I am really lazy when it comes to putting on lotion. But now that I am entering my 30s I have been trying to take better care of my skin. My mom uses this every day and convinced me to give it a shot. You don&#x27;t need as much as you think and the bottle lasts me more than a month. My skin is smoother and smells great when I get out of the shower. I use this everyday now and am grateful that this winter I don&#x27;t have to worry about freezing my butt off trying to put some lotion on after I shower. My aging (and dramatic) body thanks you!</li>
    <li> My shower really dirty. It sticks to the bottom of the tub and, leaves a slippery film. I try to use it right before I am going to clean my bathroom so, I don&#x27;t have to deal with the residue ... wish it was not as greasy but, overall, my skin loves it!</li>
    <li> This product is so convenient and works wonderfully.  I&#x27;m 75 yrs old and having been using the IN-SHOWER Olay Lotion for about 8 yrs.  It makes my old skin feel healthy and nourioused every time.  You must try it.  Thanks to Amazon for providing so many great items in one convenient shopping site.  And thanks to the Seller for the great service.</li>
    <li> I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WHEN THIS PRODUCT WAS TAKEN OFF THE MARKET, SO WAS SUPER GLAD TO FIND IT ON AMAZON.  IT HAS ALWAYS DONE WHAT IT CLAIMS...SOFTENS YOUR SKIN IN THE SHOWER.</li>
    <li> I love this product; however, it is less expensive in the store.</li>
    <li> Love this keeps your skin smooth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Olay In-Shower Lotion for years and am so happy that Amazon carries it online since it has been harder for me to find it locally.  This product is great because it keeps my skin moisturized after I shave and in the winter when my skin is itchy and dry.  I have also used it as a shaving cream.  I find it much easier and more convenient to apply this in the shower rather than having to put on lotion after showering and drying.  It&#x27;s also much easier to get this product in hard to reach places (such as my back) while in the shower.  The fragrance is somewhat floral but not horribly overpowering.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes soft skin in the winter easy and makes showering more enjoyable as it is like a mini spa treatment for dry skin. No more cold lotion! :)</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this!!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin in the summertime and this product really helps. It is much easier to apply than regular lotions with the same lasting effects.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and smells very nice.  I still put lotion on after my shower but my skin is dry.  For normal skin this would be all that you would need.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I can slather it on and rinse it off and still retain the benefits of moisturizing! The smell is great! Even after a BBQ where I was sweating profusely, at the end the day, I still smelled great! So happy with this product!</li>
    <li> At 66, my skin was beginning to feel like parchment paper that had been used over and over again and it looked it too.  My \\&quot;dark spots\\&quot; were flakey, enough so that my dark colored sweaters would turn gray with flaked off skin.  This moisturizer makes my skin feel soft and smooth after showering or even the next day and my \\&quot;dark spots\\&quot; are hardly visible any longer and I no don&#x27;t have the gray sweaters either, unless of course, I want one.  I love it.  The only thing I am not fond of is how the shower floor gets really slippery after using the product, so be careful stepping out of the shower.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorites.  The shower body lotion leaves my skin very soft.  I got a great deal on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best moisturizer I have ever used. It leaves your skin so soft and smooth and the scent is not overpowering, very light and refreshing. Since I can&#x27;t find this in stores any longer buying the pack of 4 means I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Great bargain. Fast service. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> been using this for years and wont buy anything else.  i buy 8 bottles at a time so i dont run out..</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever, leaves skin moist with light beautiful fragrence</li>
    <li> Hard to find product but makes my skin very smooth and moisturized. It&#x27;ll come in handy this winter when it gets dry.</li>
    <li> Great idea, and great product. Doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;fo-fo&amp;#34; smell which makes it great for a guy like me who doesn&#x27;t want to announce to his buddies he uses lotion, but also wants to have smooth skin. :-)</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF...THE BEST</li>
    <li> I really had not used a body wash/rinse before so this was a new experience for me. I was really suprised, my skin is so dry winter, spring , summer and fall. It was silky smooth on my skin after my shower. I had to order more! Love it  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in-shower body lotion for years.  It saves my skin from dryness and saves me time in the shower!  I don&#x27;t have to use any other moisturizer, this does it all!  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is, but I can never seem to take the time to put lotion on AFTER my shower.  I am just lazy about it.  Therefore, my skin suffers.  Tried this in shower lotion and LOVE IT!  And it makes it so simple to lotion up now that I do it everyday! No mess!  I love the scent.  Fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> First tried this product many years ago to try and deal with my husbands extreme dry skin that the dermatologist did not help. This simple product made all the difference. Local stores no longer carry it. We have tried similar products without luck.  We have tried similar products without luck. Thank you Amazon for carrying this product. Please keep offering it.</li>
    <li> This is the most moisturizing of the &amp;#34;in-shower&amp;#34; body lotions. This is a must for dry skin in the winter or in dry climates. I use it everyday and it makes a big difference.  It can make the bathtub very slippery though.</li>
    <li> I love this in-shower body lotion but have a hard time ever finding it in stores.  You apply in the shower and rinse off just like you do conditioner for your hair.  It is the best stuff for dry skin - It&#x27;s the only lotion I&#x27;ve ever found that keeps my back and legs from itching all day in the winter months.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! it has really saved me on putting lotion on after the shower and makes my skin feel super smooth! will definitely keep this in my shower routine!</li>
    <li> I honestly could not tell a difference in my skin.  I gave a bottle to a friend and she liked it</li>
    <li> we love this product! i remember when it first came out we were so excited because it was something we needed, but we didnt like the feeling and process of lotioning up when we got out of the shower. this prevents that problem! ive been using it during pregnancy and its so far prevented any further stretch marks! i highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have to confess, I am so bad about remembering to put lotion or moisturizer on after I shower...or any time, really. So, this in shower lotion is perfect for me! It smells so nice and leaves my skin feeling soft the entire day!</li>
    <li> This product is reasonably priced and does the job.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel lotion like without being to slick and slippery.  It stays hydrated on my body all day I love this in the summer cuz u rub it on quick in the shower &amp; you can run out &amp; go no mess no effort.</li>
    <li> Would not shower without this product!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  It leaves your skin feeli g soft as silk.  So happy I discovered it.</li>
    <li> Love it, except does make my shower awfully slippery.</li>
    <li> We recently decreased the humidity setting on our furnace causing our skin to get very dry. My husbands skin was so dry that he scratched at it until it bled and I needed a solution fast.  This has done wonders, it promises to improve the skins condition in 5 days and it kept that promise. It&#x27;s so slick it goes on fast in the shower and you don&#x27;t really have to rinse for long, so the time it takes seems to be shorter than that of normal lotion application and the results are true to their promise. My husband is no longer scratching at his skin, my skin is no longer flaky, and we&#x27;ve only been using it for 6 days.</li>
    <li> After reading the positive reviews for this item, I ordered it and was very excited to try it out. I suffer from patches of dry skin and I am not always diligent about moisturizing.The idea of having something you basically use as a leave-in conditioner for the skin at the end of your shower seemed very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However I wish I had researched this product a little better  - I didn&#x27;t realize when I purchased it that petrolatum is its main ingredient. Putting petrolatum on your skin for long periods of time actually inhibits the skin from producing natural oils and exacerbates dry skin and collagen breakdown. Still I figured I would try it for a couple of days for short term relief. Well, this felt really icky on my skin and made me itch in a very unpleasant, \\&quot;tiny insects under the skin\\&quot; way even after I had dried off. Not only that, the smell was so strong that it gave me a headache and I could smell it well into the next day. A week later I tried again, thinking maybe I needed to rinse off the residue more thoroughly. That experience was no better and a few days later I ended up with cystic acne on my neck and chest, areas where I never break out. The worst part is this didn&#x27;t particularly relieve the dry patches on my elbows and heels either. So I&#x27;m done with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I figured I would run with the basic idea and now just keep my Cetaphil bottle with the pump dispenser in my shower stall. When I&#x27;m done showering, I just apply the lotion, pat myself dry and voila, soft moisturized skin with none of the nasty effects of petrolatum.  If you still want to try this, save yourself the bother and just buy a $2 jar of vaseline - it&#x27;s basically the same thing.</li>
    <li> VEry good product.  Keeps my skin from getting too dry especially during the winter month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this ever since it came on the market.  I&#x27;ve tried the few other tries by other companies, but this is the only one that really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and find that it really helps to keep my skin moisturized, especially in the winter months when the heat dries out my skin.  So much easier to apply in the shower to wet skin than trying to apply lotion to dry skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001FB5NTG Olay Moisturinse In-Shower Body Lotion with shea butter, (15.2 Ounce) (Pack of 4)]] I have been using this product for a long, long time.  Whenever I want to order this product in bulk, I always use Amazon.com, because of the savings, but, I read in the the news the other day that if I order on Amazon.com and because I live in Texas, I will have to pay taxes and because I am a consumer and I live in Texas, I believe that I should have received some type of notice from Amazon.com, even if it was in some type of blanket form to let the residents of Texas to beware of the upcoming taxes, so, this order may have been my last order with Amazon.com, hate, because I love Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff even though it will stop up a drain.  Hard to find in retail so found on Amazon.  Helps to moisturize skin.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love the in shower body lotion. It takes about 10 seconds to do my whole body and with 2 kids, I don&#x27;t have time to put on lotion after the shower and be sticky for 15 more minutes!! Love it!! Buying it for my family for stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> I wish everyone knew about this in the shower body lotion!  I always hated the feeling of regular lotion.  This keeps my skin hydrated without the oily greasy feeling of after shower lotions.  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores and I hope they keep making it - it&#x27;s the best solution I&#x27;ve found for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores. It smells and works great. Skin feels nice and soft after the shower.</li>
    <li> Love in-shower lotion, can put it on and have it last for days.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered this thinking it was the shea body wash...to my surprise it is a body lotion which you apply in the shower after you&#x27;ve used a shower gel.  It leaves your skin soft and moisturized.  I like it better than the baby oil that I used to use...plus it does NOT leave my shower a slippery mess!!</li>
    <li> I love how easy this lotion is! My husband has really bad dry skin and refuses to put on lotion, so I bought this and he uses it! It&#x27;s helped him a lot. I love the smell as well.</li>
