<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this entire line and save a lot getting it thru Amazon</li>
    <li> I tried the Yonka cleansing milk and I liked it but it didn&#x27;t like my skin.  My adult acne really flared up so had to stop using all Yonka products.  Bummer.  The acne is really touchy.</li>
    <li> Creamy and smooth, like bathing your face in cream but actually cleaning it well.  Consider buying this with the Yonka lotion.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love the affect, the feel, the smell and ingredients of all the Yonka products.  It is not cheap in price but neither is the quality.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> For cleaning my face and getting off the make-up in the shower EXCELLENT for my skin!</li>
    <li> A great product and a great product line as a whole. A very gentle cleanser, plus cleanses very well without drying out the skin. Highly recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it keeps my face so soft and hydrated. It doesn&#x27;t do a great job of removing eye makeup but I have an inexpensive product to do that. I ran out of this and was using a different product and my face didn&#x27;t seem as soft or hydrated. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying that over the past two years my skin has dramatically gone down hill. It began with a severe sunburn which brought out a moderate case of roseaca that included redness and bumps. I went to a dermatologist who had me try out 4 seperate prescription gels/creams over the course of two years which only slightly reduced the redness and bumps but then gave me such a severe case of dryness and flaking that I wanted to wear a bag over my head.&lt;br /&gt;Make up made it worse. I&#x27;ve tried powder &amp; liquid but both only outlined the cracks &amp; flakes making it worse.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a variety of different cleansers and lotions including natural/organic things as well as department store offerings &amp; nothing made much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I was desperate &amp; happened to see that a famous actress uses the line. I figured if she&#x27;s paid to look good maybe I should give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG I am so glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried &amp; I sincerely hope to keep using it for the rest of my years. It is super gentle to the point that I got some in my eye and it didn&#x27;t sting one bit. When I got the product my skin around my nose was raw, peeling &amp; dry. Aloe gel from the bottle burned BUT not my Yonka Cleansing Milk. In fact, it soothed my skin. From the first use I saw significant improvement. I am in love with these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are they pricey? Yes BUT the way I use the cleanser I&#x27;m sure it will last months. I take a dry cottom square (the kind you buy to remove makeup) and put a dab of it on the square. Then I rub it gently over my face and neck. I follow it up with a splash of warm water from my hands and my face is soft &amp; refreshed. It does very well with taking off a decent layer of makeup BUT if you are wearing waterproof eye makeup it does take an additional washing of the eye area to get it all off. Quite frankly it&#x27;s worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I was worried about was that I would breakout due to the excessive moisture but quite the opposite...no breakouts. My skin is in the best condition of my life.oisture but quite the opposite...no breakouts. My skin is in the best condition of my life.</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite cleanser because it leaves my skin feeling a bit oily after makeup removal, but does remove the makeup well</li>
    <li> So smooth and great for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell too despite others saying it &amp;#34;smells like old lady creams&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It is blue lotion. smells very nice. seems to clean my face. does not leave it feeling oily or too dry. will purchase again</li>
    <li> have used this cleansing milk for many years -</li>
    <li> Wonderdful stuff. So gentle</li>
    <li> I have been using Yonka since these early 90&#x27;s and LOVE these products.  I have used this cleansing milk for my face and eyes and get the best results with only a quarter size to massage into my face for a clean and refreshing look at bedtime.  I also use some mornings just for a refresh and it smells so nice.</li>
    <li> I have been using Yonka since my mid 20&#x27;s.  Im now 45 and have maintained a youthful glow and complexion.  While I have tried other brands both cheap and expensive I have always come back to Yonka.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years - would not put any other cleanser on my face!  Feels fresh - has a wonderful scent!</li>
    <li> Love this product, it came as stated and I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years - love it and happy I can find it online</li>
    <li> My very favorite lotion. I have combination skin that is prone to blemishes. A little bit goes a long way, so the cost isn&#x27;t as dramatic as it may seem.</li>
    <li> Cleanses even eye makeup and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  I use it on the outside though being careful not to get it in my eye.  Take it all off with a tissue, then rinse my face with lots of water.</li>
    <li> It does not clean off eye makeup as well as it says, a lot of extra &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; or additional eye make up remover required.</li>
    <li> fabulous! feels great, smells great!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for an excellent price. Delivered promptly by seller.</li>
    <li> The product smells...interesting.  It&#x27;s a baby-powderish fragrance that reminds me of my grandmother.  As much as I love her, I do not want my face to smell that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans pretty well, except it doesn&#x27;t get my mascara off (not a waterproof mascara).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this, but will definitely not buy again.</li>
    <li> LOVE-LOVE-LOVE this cleanser!! It takes off eye make-up along with all other face make-up with ease. Does not sting whatsoever so you can open your eyes with it on your eyes (to make sure you&#x27;ve got all of the mascara off) before rinsing if off! :) Also very gentle on your skin and moisturizing so your face does not feel tight or &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; of all natural oils.</li>
    <li> YONKA Cleansing milk is a great mild cleanser for my face.  I can not use really intense cleansers as I have sensitive skin.  Most cleansers are far too drying.  I have been using YONKA Cleansing milk for over 15 years and it&#x27;s a staple in my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> Great for my 44 year old skin. Gentle and cleansing. Leaves my face soft and not dry.</li>
