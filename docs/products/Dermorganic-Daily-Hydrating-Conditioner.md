      <li>And I love how it works on my hair.</li>
      <li>love the product however.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s o.k., but I need something more to get out my tangles.</li>
      <li>Not quite sure why,</li>
      <li>Smells great like the shampoo and again feels really hydrating when in the shower.</li>
      <li>This conditioner goes wonderfully well with the same brand sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and very light, and it&#x27;s great for hydrating the curls but not weighing them down.</li>
      <li>i have been trying all sorts of organic hair products and it&#x27;s such as shame that there aren&#x27;t very many good ones - this one included.</li>
      <li>It also happens to be gluten free which is another plus.  </li>
      <li>The smell is light &amp; clean.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair super soft and gives a really good wash.</li>

      <li>It would be nice if the fragrance was the same as the shampoo I got!(DermOrganic Sulfate-Free Conditioning Shampoo, 33.8 fl.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and left my hair hydrated.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair silky soft and still feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>I just wish it could be a little cheaper, but I love the pump and I love the way it washes and rinses out.</li>
      <li>I used both the shampoo and conditioner of this DermOrganic Sulfate Free, but the shampoo didn&#x27;t clean my hair well enough.  </li>
      <li>I like this conditioner, but not as much as the masque because it doesn&#x27;t calm my hair the way the masque does.</li>
      <li>Regardless of how much she uses she still cannot get a brush through her hair without shreaks of pain!</li>
      <li>Works pretty well.</li>
      <li>Another reviewer wrote she just buys a regular conditioner that she normally uses because the shampoo does such a great job that she really does not need the conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use much and mostly use conditioner for the ends of my long hair, not the roots.  </li>
      <li>Both the shampoo &amp; conditioner require large amounts to work</li>
      <li>However my daughter, for whom I purchased it for has VERY curly hair and has to use a lot of conditioner.</li>
      <li>I really like this conditioner</li>
      <li>the ingredients are very alluring but it doesn&#x27;t deliver no moisture</li>
      <li>highly recommend for processed hair.</li>
      <li>I cannot get the conditioner where I live, so I ordered through Amazon.</li>
      <li>i actually found that Pantene relaxed and natural moisturized very well and saved my wallet and hair..</li>
      <li>I have tried Wen, which is a rip off and does not work nearly as well as DermOrganic.</li>
      <li>My coarse, curly hair much prefers the DermOrganic hair masque (which is what I thought I was ordering - my mistake).</li>
      <li>It also makes me feel good that I am avoiding unnecessary chemicals!</li>
      <li>I love this product, it only takes a small amount</li>
      <li>I have also found that their products last me a long time making the price very reasonable.</li>
      <li>purchased 1st from a salon which was a little pricey and then found it on Amazon and have ordered many other products from this line.</li>
      <li>The conditioner smells better but not great.</li>
      <li>and I feel it leaves my hair soft once my hair is dry.</li>

<li> Because the bottle is small, and my hair is thick AND long, I have to pump 6-8 times to get enough of it to cover most of the strands.</li>

<li> do this due to the small size of the conditioner.  </li>
<li> Helps with tangles enough but not perfectly.</li>

    <li> I personally found this to be a bit too drying for my hair in combination with the shampoo, but from an ingredients standpoint it&#x27;s a great find! I would have kept using it if not for my hair disliking it.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of hair care products! They make the only organic shampoo and conditioner that I have tried that works on my hair. I have long wavy thick hair and this product makes my hair manageable and soft without being too greasy or too dry. I have also found that their products last me a long time making the price very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. I do wish the fragrance wasn&#x27;t so perfumy, yuk...but it does the job. It would be nice if the fragrance was the same as the shampoo I got!(DermOrganic Sulfate-Free Conditioning Shampoo, 33.8 fl. smells very good, not heavy)</li>
    <li> this stuff is great for chemically treated dry hair. purchased 1st from a salon which was a little pricey and then found it on Amazon and have ordered many other products from this line. after 2 days of using the conditioner after regularly bleaching my hair, the dryness and frizz was gone. its lightweight enough to be used as a leave-in conditioner for thick hair to act as a heat protector. highly recommend for processed hair.</li>
    <li> I have looked for a shampoo and conditioner that does not feel heavy, too oily or dry. This is a great product that seems to work for me. I cannot get the conditioner where I live, so I ordered through Amazon. Great stuff and does not have an overly perfumed fragrance. Nice balance.</li>
    <li> I like the conditioner. However my daughter, for whom I purchased it for has VERY curly hair and has to use a lot of conditioner. Regardless of how much she uses she still cannot get a brush through her hair without shreaks of pain! Alert to the curlied haired folks out there.&lt;br /&gt;I love the product however.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s o.k., but I need something more to get out my tangles. Have to use their oil leave in treatment, or else I can&#x27;t even get a comb through my hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner and it has a really nice scent that is not over done. I liked the conditioner better than the shampoo I bought with it. It also happens to be gluten free which is another plus.  I would buy this conditioner again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it only takes a small amount so it lasts a long time.  The best organic hair product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and left my hair hydrated.</li>
    <li> And I love how it works on my hair. I am gluten intolerant and my neck and scalp no longer break out.</li>
    <li> I got this to go with my dermorganic shampoo, treatment, and masque. They all make my hair feel good and easy to manage</li>
    <li> I have tried this product in the past through my salon before and was overjoyed to find it on Amazon! I have tried Wen, which is a rip off and does not work nearly as well as DermOrganic.</li>
    <li> This conditoner was pretty good, but again...DON&#x27;T PURCHASE THE SHAMPOO !!! Especially if you are used to WEN.  You might want to try ONE from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply</li>
    <li> It has a rancid smell to it did not notice any difference in my hair, therefore I cannot&lt;br /&gt;rate it good.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair silky soft and still feeling very clean. It also makes me feel good that I am avoiding unnecessary chemicals!</li>
    <li> I have Celiacs Disease and my scalp breaks out with sores if I use any shampoo that has wheat in it.  THIS product does not have gluten in it and it feels wonderful on my scalp.  It smells lovely (no harsh chemical odor) and my husband uses it too!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair super soft and gives a really good wash. I just wish it could be a little cheaper, but I love the pump and I love the way it washes and rinses out. I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> the ingredients are very alluring but it doesn&#x27;t deliver no moisture what so ever.  I tried it for over 2 weeks to give it a fair shake. I have 4a hair and it dodn nothing but create white residue and made my hair frizz and puff up in search or moisture from the atmosphere. I was very disappointed but I should have known when the description said &amp;#34;light weight&amp;#34;- said descriptions dontt work on African textured hair. i actually found that Pantene relaxed and natural moisturized very well and saved my wallet and hair..</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo &amp; conditioner but was very disappointed. It may be organic &amp; safe for sensitive issues but that would be the only thing good. The shampoo makes my hair smell like a just washed DOG. It&#x27;s a terrible scent. Both the shampoo &amp; conditioner require large amounts to work well if you have any moderate hair thickness and/or length. These are small bottles so a little should go a long way. The conditioner smells better but not great. It&#x27;s a pineapple scent. Oh, and the pump mechanism broke on my shampoo. I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is sold in a much smaller container than the shampoo.  Not quite sure why, but, you will definitely need to replace, several times if you use every time you shampoo.  Another reviewer wrote she just buys a regular conditioner that she normally uses because the shampoo does such a great job that she really does not need the conditioner.  In reading the ingredients of the mask that they make, could probably use the mask like a conditioner.  They do make a mask in the same sizes as the shampoos.  I will probably&lt;br /&gt;will do this due to the small size of the conditioner.  Smells great like the shampoo and again feels really hydrating when in the shower.</li>
    <li> This conditioner goes wonderfully well with the same brand sulfate-free shampoo. It feels great on the scalp and hair and rinses cleanly. The smell is pleasant and very light, and it&#x27;s great for hydrating the curls but not weighing them down.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner. I have thick curly hair and I feel it leaves my hair soft once my hair is dry. In the shower it feels silky.  Helps with tangles enough but not perfectly. The smell is light &amp; clean. I think I&#x27;d buy again. The conditioning shampoo is awful though. It feels like detergent on your hair &amp; smells like it too.</li>
    <li> I used both the shampoo and conditioner of this DermOrganic Sulfate Free, but the shampoo didn&#x27;t clean my hair well enough.  I have oily hair.  The conditioner smells great and did a nice job.  I didn&#x27;t need to use much and mostly use conditioner for the ends of my long hair, not the roots.  I&#x27;m back for my second bottle.</li>
    <li> i have been trying all sorts of organic hair products and it&#x27;s such as shame that there aren&#x27;t very many good ones - this one included. it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. just tends to feel dry in the end. i would not purchase this conditioner again.</li>
    <li> My coarse, curly hair much prefers the DermOrganic hair masque (which is what I thought I was ordering - my mistake). I like this conditioner, but not as much as the masque because it doesn&#x27;t calm my hair the way the masque does. Because the bottle is small, and my hair is thick AND long, I have to pump 6-8 times to get enough of it to cover most of the strands. Considering the bottle is about the size of a can of soda, it won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
