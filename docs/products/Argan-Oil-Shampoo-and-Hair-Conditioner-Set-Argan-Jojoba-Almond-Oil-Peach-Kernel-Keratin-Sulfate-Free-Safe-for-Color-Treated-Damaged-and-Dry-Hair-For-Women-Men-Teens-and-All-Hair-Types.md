<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Its a great product,my hair really soft and great! I love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I used ot on my niece&#x27;s thick natural hair right after a protein treatment and her hair was extremely soft and tangle free. The comb just glided right through her hair which never happens. This conditioner is now permanently a part of her haircare regimen. Shipping was extremely fast.</li>
    <li> I use it on the ends of my hair as a in-shower and occasionally leave-in after the shower also. I do not shampoo but use only water and a mild citric acid rinse. It works well for my super delicate fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argan conditioner has been awesome to keep the ends hydrated and sealed from being too porous (a struggle I&#x27;ve had no matter what I used on hair)... Couldn&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
    <li> amazing and its soapy!</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I have ever used... I am not even kidding.  This stuff is like butter!  Pleasant scent, and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.</li>
    <li> I love it. It works to my thick and curly hair. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is really long so I use this on my ends and their degreasing shampoo on my scalp. This conditioner makes my ends so soft and smooth. No frizz or anything. My hair is naturally super straight so I have a hard time finding things to use that won&#x27;t make my hair look greasy. This product is amazing and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Maple Holistics are The Best Product Ive ever had on my scalp, thats for sure, This Argan Oil Conditioner is the best, It really gets deep down and fixes any damage you have on your hair. When I use it it leaves my hair so smooth, and light, It has absolutely no weigh down.</li>
    <li> very good product but a little expensive. the shampoo is amazing one the best</li>
    <li> Gives hair shine and body but also makes hair look oily sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> This product is great for our daughter&#x27;s hair (her hair is wavy and long) and especially for detangling.  I cannot find any other product to work like this.  But the price is high.  I tried to email customer service (the contact us button on their webpage) 4 times and no answer.  I even emailed them from my email twice and no response.  I just want a discount code for more than 2 bottles at a time but their customer service sucks.  This was all in a two week period so there is no excuse for not getting back to me.  Bad customer service makes me rethink using the product even tho it works.</li>
    <li> First let me say that due to a medical condition I have not had a hair cut or color in five months and my hair is very dry, course and frizzy_ it&#x27;s also breaking off. I do have a hair appointment scheduled and decided to try this product before that, my reasoning being if it can make a difference to this mess _ then I know it&#x27;s a good product!&lt;br /&gt;  I used the product as instructed but after applying it I combed it through my hair and just let it soak in while I finished showering. It had a very light and soft refreshing scent. I used just a bit more then recommended due to my hairs condition. I had read other reviews that thought that the size of the bottle was small for the price, well I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.&lt;br /&gt;  I have used some of the very best and very expensive conditioners on the market and this product should be right at the top of the best! I could not believe what a difference it made!&lt;br /&gt;  My hair dried looking soft and with more shine then I have seen in along time, even the texture was so improved _ it honestly looked like I had it trimmed, it did not in any way look weighted down or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;  Needless to say I am in love with this and will be ordering more products from Maple Holistics and want to say thank you for an awesome conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Leaves my corse grey colored hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> The first product that I used by this company, was the Silk 18 conditioner. I loved that product, however, I wanted to experiment with their other products since I had such a great experience with the first one. I absolutely love the Argan Oil Conditioner! It leaves my hair soft with my curls defined. It is very difficult to find a product that I think works well with my curly texture and this conditioner is definitely one that works amazingly.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, I love that it is all natural and smells so good.  It makes my hair feel wonderful.  I am working to see if I need to leave it longer on my hair, I am still have an issue with my scalp being dry.  I will buy this again and keep using it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. Helped my hair gain new life again!</li>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner with amazing soft silky effects for the hair. So far I have used this product three times and every time it has left my hair silky and shiny smooth. After using countless brands of shampoo, from drug stores to high in salon brands, this is by far my favorite both use and price wise.</li>
    <li> I just say wow with this product which is wonderful and satisfied. This product is quite good that improve my hair. In the past, my hair is quite dry and easily cracked or damaged. I use many types of shampoo but it is not suitable with my hair. Finally, this one is quite fitted with mine. I really love this one.</li>
    <li> Very pleased! Soft silky airy feel.</li>
    <li> After looking online for many website finding the right shampoo &amp; conditioner i found this product which i think could be right product for my hair, after one use my hair have rejuvenated and look fresh and shiny, i love this shampoo and conditioner, i did feel the difference compare to shampoo i was currently using. Its pricey but common isn&#x27;t your hair precious commodity :)</li>
    <li> My hair feels much softer and I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This argan conditioner it&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t really condition my hair.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the argan oil conditioner. So far I&#x27;ve only used it once but it seems to have worked ok. It&#x27;s not a lathery as I would like but It detangled my hair in a decent manner. I&#x27;ll continue to use the product over the next few weeks to see how my hair takes to it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner worked okay for me but I have used better won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my hair. Would sueely recomend this one.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this conditioner! Last summer I discovered I am allergic to silicones and that&#x27;s why I was always breaking out so I gave up conditioner all together. Since I recently lightened my hair with bleach I really needed something to repair the damage.  This is amazing, it makes my hair silky and manageable and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, even when I use a little in the ends as a leave-in.  This is a must-have for me only regret not finding it sooner!</li>
    <li> Love it! Leaves my hair soft and silky but not greasy</li>
    <li> The Argan Oil Conditioner has a very lovely scent to it and did not weigh down my hair after use at all. On the morning following the night of shower, my hair was very silky and light. My usual frizziness was completely gone, however any hair volume went away with it as well. I recommend this conditioner for those who usually style their hair, as it leaves my natural hair rather limp. Overall, I do love this product leaves my hair feeling healthy and soft!</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought but not bad as an add-on for the price.  My hair is dyed red and I color it once a month which wrecks havoc on my ends.  I decided to buy this product because it&#x27;s sulfate-free and all natural.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  My color did not run into the tub and my hair feels soft even my ends!  I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Horrible dries out my hair :(</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I like how clean and shine my hair looks. I tried stay 3 days without washing, and was still perfect. For sure, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to repair my hair. It is very dry and is breaking.  This conditioner seems to be helping to smooth and recondition the hair.  It is much more manageable and looks healthier.  So happy that I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Less harsh than regular drugstore brands.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I was looking for a replacement product rather than redken, and stumbled on this. I&#x27;ve been using it a week now and it is just what I was looking for! Detangles enough without totally weighing it down or looking greasy. I have fine/ thin hair.</li>
    <li> I love the simplicity of this conditioner. I am used to using up conditioners so quickly but a little bit goes a long way. My hair feels soft throughout the day and compared the big name products, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> The Shampoo and Conditioner are really good</li>
    <li> My hair type:&lt;br /&gt;Natural African American hair, Thick density, thin strands, shoulder length, low porosity, 4B type tight spiral curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I have used this product:&lt;br /&gt;Bi-weekly - I have used this product bi-weekly for the past 3 months. my results are based on that usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Distributes well - this means I use less even though the bottle is only an 8oz size.&lt;br /&gt;Because it distributes well, it does help de-tangle, but it doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; that makes de-tangling easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very drying to my hair - did not make my hair soft at all, as a matter of fact, it dried it out.&lt;br /&gt;Does not aid in de-tangling my hair; it actually causes it to tangle more after I rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;Cost: It does keep increasing in price, and the size is only 8oz, but because so little is needed, it can last a while&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer does offer a discount for honest reviews, but some people may misconstrue this as being an offer for a free or discounted product for a positive review. Why would you want a free or discounted product that doesn&#x27;t benefit you anyway?&lt;br /&gt;There is no scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product more than I did, but I can&#x27;t get on board with all the positive reviews. It just didn&#x27;t give me that &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor I was hoping for. I will keep it around though, because I only need a little even for my thick hair, and that is always a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;1. Do I like this? Somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;2. Will I recommend this to a friend? Possibly, mostly to my Caucasian friends with straight and/or oily hair. I would not recommend this for Natural African American Hair, which I have.&lt;br /&gt;3. Will I purchase this again in the next 90 days? Probably not.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing! I was looking for something silicone-free and I am really pleased with the results. My hair was dry and frizzy before, this really helped it look and feel healthier. It smells nice and the price is right. I use it after shampooing and I leave it in for a few minutes before rinsing. It has a nice, silky feel and makes my hair easy to brush.</li>
    <li> These are really great -- second set (used Silky 18) and both are amazing...the shampoo is as lovely as conditioner...they seem expensive for what you get, but they last FOREVER as you do not need to use a lot.</li>
    <li> Really like this. Made my thick coarse hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this product it&#x27;s made my hair really soft and flexible. my hair is pretty dry because I always bleach my hair for coloring and highlights . Now I don&#x27;t have to worry for dying my hair because I have this *_*! thanks.</li>
    <li> The conditioner worked really well on my well. There really wasn&#x27;t much of a scent.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use it because it has Aloe in it but my granddaughter likes it.</li>
    <li> I have just below shoulder length fine hair. I have been looking for a conditioner without harmful ingredients that will help condition and reduce frizzy flyaways. I love this Argan oil Conditioner.after 2 weeks of use my hair is very SOFT! Shiny! Lots of Body and it does a great great job on taming flyaways and frizz!  I am really really happy with this product and will buy it again I was contacted by Maple Holistics regarding another product I had bought and their customer service was great. Very helpful to make sure I was totally satisfied with the product and did I want a replacement.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok conditioner not as good as Silk 18 which makes my hair super soft . Doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair , but doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin so will use it anyway. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again .</li>
    <li> Tried this item twice and both times my hair was a giant ball of frizz. Completely unmanageable.  I have very long, silver-white hair and this did not work at all for me</li>
    <li> No grease, no sticky after feeling, just smooth curls that shine.  I&#x27;ll sit and touch my own hair and go &amp;#34;Wow this is what hair is supposed to be like&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to chemicals and additives in most products and this makes my hair, scalp, even my hands feel soft after using it.  More products should use ingredients that might actually benefit peoples&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> One of the best conditioners i have ever used.  I used it along with the argan oil shampoo.  my hair is curly and dry and this conditioner left if soft and not frizzy.  It has a very light and nice smell.  Its seem great for my very sensitive scalp.  My hair looks shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> I waited a while to see how this worked on my hair over time. I have very dry hair and scalp. This conditioner makes my hair smoother and hydrates it immediately.  I used the Hydrate shampoo, which is helpful for my scalp, but I definitely need this conditioner to make my thick, dry hair manageable afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free and cruelty-free, and I am going to order some more.</li>
    <li> I love anything with argan oil and it does better than any regular shampoos that buy from stores or beauty salons.it makes your hair feel soft</li>
    <li> I tried the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; route for my hair but everything seems to make my hair really oily and eventually devolves into dandruff which I&#x27;ve never had before. I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner with the associated shampoo for a couple of weeks now and so far I am delighted. I wear my hair up and under a cap for work so I don&#x27;t bother to wash it throughout the week. It isn&#x27;t until the 5th day that my hair starts to go limp and get oily and when I wash it it feels fantastic. I have baby fine hair but lot&#x27;s of it and this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, probably just a quarter sized blob of the both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> very nice, feels good!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair super soft, silky and manageable even after dying and bleaching it uncountable times. Also, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Light and effective without weighing down my baby fine hair.</li>
    <li> It took me a few times to get use to the difference in the conditioner to what I regularly use (Dove). I have to say that it didn&#x27;t leave any of that heavy conditioner feel after rinsing in my hair and it felt like it was doing what it was intended to do. A little bit works just fine and I use my fingers to lightly de-tangle my hair. I also love that it only has natural ingredients and has a nice simple smell that doesn&#x27;t come from artificial perfumes. I wanted to find a product that offered only natural ingredients and would help my hair which is very dry and brittle. So far it seems to be working and has helped a lot of the dryness. I also use it by itself (no shampooing) sometimes and still cleans my hair and doesn&#x27;t become oily the next day so I can skip a washing and my hair still looks and smells great. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to change to a different type of hair product and needs something that will condition it and make your hair feel healthier. Plus the price is pretty reasonable compared to a lot of other hair products.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner. Just rub it through your hair and let it set 2-3 minutes and it made my hair feel great. I have curly hair and it made it very manageable.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is all natural ingredients and is not only good for your hair but actually works! Other products that I have tried have left my hair feeling either dry or just blah. It only takes a small amount as this product spreads through your hair easily. There is no scent. I would definitely order this product again and I am excited to try others!</li>
    <li> Was about to purchase the WEN product but found this item &amp; based on the reviews, wanted to give this a try!  I wash my hair two times a week &amp; it gets greasy/oily pretty fast, especially using my previous conditioners, like the next day after a wash (Head &amp; Shoulders/Pantene)!  This product helps ease my hair getting too greasy/oily in the first 48hrs, which is a big change for me!!  Gentle on my hair/scalp &amp; I don&#x27;t blow my hair (have shoulder length hair).  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For reference, I have very fine, oily hair, while my husband has very thick, dry hair. We both LOVE this conditioner. The first time I used this, I literally couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair because it was SO shiny and soft! I use this in conjunction with [[ASIN:B009DU4QYE Shampoo for Oily, Itchy &amp; Greasy Hair By Maple Holistics]] while my hubby uses just this conditioner. His hair is so much healthier now that he gave up shampoo, and I&#x27;m happy that I found a great conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a warning: Some people think this weighs their hair down when they start using it. This is usually reported by people who wash their hair every day, who also use typical shampoos that strip the hair of its natural oil. When you strip your hair that often, your scalp overcompensates by creating more oil. The Maple Holistics brand does NOT strip your hair, so for the first few days, your hair will seem a bit greasy--this is perfectly normal. It takes a couple of days (up to a week) for your scalp to stop producing excess oil; after that, your hair will be more shiny and healthy than ever. Just rough it out for about a week before you leave negative reviews!</li>
    <li> I really like it. It&#x27;s went to work in my hair. The sage shampoo I use dry my hair out so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. This really soften a great deal after that. I imagine if it was used on a nonshampoo day I would have been even more impressed. I would not use this during the detangling process I have coarse thin kinky hair that gets tangled extremely easily. Not enough slip in this conditioner for detangling my type of hair. However on other hair types it might be a blessing. Giving it 4 stars because I was unable to keep from comparing it to silk 18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: smell, ingredients, softness of hair&lt;br /&gt;Con: not silk 18, not enough slip, size of the bottle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pharmacist and have a deep background in compounding and chemistry.  I have learned to steer clear of any &amp;#34;Holistic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; products because they blatantly lie and are run by agents who want to exploit a crazy fringe.  I&#x27;ve had a LIFE LONG problem with eczema on my scalp, do to allergies and compounded by fungus when I wear a hat.  I was AMAZED that after only 2 uses I can see down to my plain skin on my scalp when looking in the mirror and all the escema was gone..  I&#x27;ve been using Pantene for years because it is the best I could find, but this set a WHOLE other standard of clean for my hair.  I&#x27;m not in love with the woodsy smell, but you can&#x27;t argue with the results.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, from the smell to the texture, it is fantastic! When I apply it on my towel dried hair and then use the comb and the dryer to straighten my hair, my hair gets a nice shine and it&#x27;s tamed down. No other oil does that for me.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this. It leaves my hair feeling coated and not clean. While I think it does condition I don&#x27;t like that feeling. It&#x27;s not great at detangling either. It&#x27;s quite costly for the size you get.</li>
    <li> Overall, I&#x27;d rate it a 7 out of 10.  There are so many factors outside of the control of Maple Holistics, though, that go into this rating.  My hair is uber-thick, curly, and dry.  There are two conditioners I&#x27;ve ever truly loved and I have tried a LOT in my quest to tame my mane.  Given my hair, I need conditioner that forms &amp;#34;stiff peaks&amp;#34; when squeezed into my hand.  This conditioner formed &amp;#34;soft peaks,&amp;#34; which puts it leaps and bounds above the other &amp;#34;raw egg, no peaks&amp;#34; brands I&#x27;ve had the misfortune of trying.  I truly believe that without hair like mine, hair that has led to the nickname &amp;#34;Mu&amp;#34; (short for Mufasa) being bestowed upon me, you&#x27;ll enjoy the product.  So, bad news: not so perfect for my hair.  Good news: totally worth a shot for yours.</li>
    <li> Definitely would recommend !! Needed a sulfate free conditioner for my frizzy unruly hair, and it worked  also appreciate card with tips on it from maple holistics ;)</li>
    <li> Its okay, but nothing I would not order again. It made no difference  in my hair what&#x27;s so ever. It did nothing to restore it,  or add moisture, or add  volume.</li>
    <li> This product did virtually nothing when I left it out on my naturally thick and wavy hair which has been severely broken and considerably thinner; I did not know that it is probably specifically for rinse-out as it seems to be indicated to be. I will do it that way next time I&#x27;m in the shower and see how well it works.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used so far,  i noticed a difference after just one use, my hair litterally feels like silk and is way less damaged! I&#x27;m so glad i switched conditioners.</li>
    <li> I bought their Degreaser shampoo first (which is amazing!) and my tweenage daughter thought that it made her hair feel fluffy (or what I like to call clean). So I bought this to help condition it. I LOVE Maple Holistics&#x27; products - so far we have Degreaser, Argan Oil Conditioner and Hydrate. I have color treated, highlighted, AND permed hair. My hair has never felt or looked better and I&#x27;ve used some pretty expensive hair care before. I&#x27;ll be letting my hairdresser know about these products!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it is organic and contains no harsh chemicals that could possibly damage my hair in the long run.  Another conditioner in another brand which contains argan oil gave me allergic reactions  around my neck that lasts for 2 weeks.  So far,  this product from Maple Holistics has not given me reactions like that.  The downside is my hair is not as manageable as the other brand. How I wish I can have a product that gives my hair manageability, body and bounce without the allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review for both the Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner by Maple Holistics.  In addition to using these products, I also have a different brand of 100% Pure Argan Oil. I thought these products would go down the drain just like everything else I’ve purchased for my hair. I have spent thousands of dollars – trying everything new that comes out to control my hair and nothing – and I mean nothing – works. I’ve been reading up on argan oil and figured I’d give these products a try. The main problem is my hair that it is overly frizzy. I wake in the morning to bam, a pile of puff. No matter how short I’ve kept my hair it is always the same thing. When it was long, it had to be in a ponytail and even then the tail had a mind of its own. Forget flat ironing too; it would just make my hair like straw and fry the ends. Just terrible hair!! I wash my hair about twice a week, if that, and always with cool water. Since using the shampoo/conditioner, I have noticed that my puff is gone! Every morning I awake to see the condition of my hair and with a few pulls here and there, I’m actually good to go!! This has never happened before – and I mean never. I will lightly blow dry my hair and use about a pea size conditioner plus argan oil together to smooth it out; I can even flip my hair upside down and rake my fingers through it and it will be the smoothest hair (for days) I’ve ever had.  I’m now afraid to use anything still in  my bathroom; heck, why should I, as I know this is a keeper for sure!</li>
    <li> I just found it by accident, I have really dry hair and been trying to find something to help and have Argan Oil in a bottle and thought to try this out as well. I love the fact it&#x27;s got natural ingredients, the only reason I took off a star is because I have long hair and need to use a lot so I would like a larger bottle. Otherwise I really like it and will be trying out their other products in the future. This left my hair softer after one use and easier to maintain. Thanks and will look forward to getting more - arrived on time and quickly!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It works like a charm. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was good a idea to use this but then I tried it anyway. It made my hair silky smooth. The best part of this conditioner is that there is no fragrance. This is one of the best hair softner available out there. I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> This is the most AMAZING conditioner ever. I&#x27;m caucasian and have long course curly hair and this has made my hair so amazingly soft and tangle free...YAY! I&#x27;m sold on this line from here on. I also bought the Winter Blend shampoo and conditioner set and that is awesome as well but I&#x27;m honestly more fond of the Argan oil conditioner, even as a co wash. This company makes some AWESOME shampoo and conditioner and I Love the fact that they use natural ingredients so in my book, they&#x27;re even that much more awesome! It&#x27;s hard to find an all natural shampoo and conditioner that does such an amazing job on my hair, but this sure did! Thank you, thank you, thank you....you made a believer out of me!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!my new favorite!!</li>
    <li> this product is great!  i have dry scalp and have been trying organic shampoo and conditioners for over 2 years and this one smells the best, has been the best for my scalp AND hair, softens without greasiness, and gives me volume without frizziness.  i love it and will use it as long as i can get it!  my only *minor* complaint is that i&#x27;m not able to buy a larger size.</li>
    <li> My mother needed a product to repair her hairs. I found this wonderful item here, with one of the greatest discount, and now she can&#x27;t wash her hairs without it! I am going to order a lot of this product to make happy my mom! Her friends now order it and they are so happy!</li>
    <li> Nothing special from this conditioner. I was hoping it would tame my frizzies but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and I love the product! My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product. My hair has been damaged from coloring and this cognition ear makes hair look and feel great. Looks to be repairing damage done from processing of color.</li>
    <li> aaaaaaaaaah i love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought this conditioner after reading the great reviews, but found it wasn&#x27;t for me. I have thick, heavy hair (and a lot of it!) and thought &amp;#34;Well, others have had success, let&#x27;s try it!&amp;#34; I used it for almost 6 weeks. Even though I rinsed it well, the conditioner left my scalp really oily and left my hair very, very dry, tangled, and limp. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been losing my hair over the years, resulting in a drier, itchier scalp.  I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners, but they all have chemicals that my hair and scalp don&#x27;t like.  I recently purchased this conditioner and have immediately noticed a reduction in dryness and itchiness, and a more natural feel in my hair. I would recommend this to anyone who has had similar experiences and wants to get rid of the harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive but this is my favorite conditioner and shampoo at the moment.</li>
    <li> We have been swimming nearly every fay this summer and the chlorine in the water does a number on our hair. My wife and I use this conditioner along with the shampoo and have great feeling hair afterwards. We&#x27;ve tried countless products and this is the best product for peope who are hard on their hair.</li>
    <li> Best natural Shampoo and Conditioner on the market</li>
    <li> I had tried like so many conditioners on my hair and every time my hair were more frizzy and rough . But this one was a true blessing for my hair . It made my hair super shiny and smooth . Just Love it !!</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and I have curly hair.  That should be enough said! I am constantly on the hunt for ANY type of hair care that can maintain the beast I call my hair.  My sister, who is unfortunate enough to have the same problem as me, ordered 2 bottles of this after she found it on Amazon. I knew I loved Argan oil but a lot of times argan oil conditioner leaves my hair SUPER oily.  Not this brand. I had absolutely no problem with oil, grease, residue or frizz! I found my new best friend.  Thanks Sis!!  I am ordering another bottle now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall.  5 stars because it tamed the beast,</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner a lot.  It has holistic ingredients, great texture and packaging that allows the conditioner to dispense without getting too much or too little.  It feels good going on my hair and provides the manageability that my hair needs.</li>
    <li> Loved it at first but over time not so much.</li>
    <li> I Don&#x27;t know what happened to my 1st review but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just started using the conditioner about a week ago that my boyfriend (CHRIS) bought for me, so far I really love it.  I have ethnic hair, so my hair is very thick and curly, since using the conditioner, it has left my hair soft every time and smells good.  So as of now I really love the conditioner. :)</li>
    <li> I have issues with fragrances and have had trouble finding a conditioner to calm my frizzy/curly hair. This was has worked great no offensive smell and I use very little product each time. enjoyed and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used! I have tried very expensive brands and cheap ones but this is better than anything, it makes my very fine hair full and I don&#x27;t even have to reapply hairspray or any product throughout the day! I used to have to carry a bottle of hairspray everywhere I went, not any more. Even in the humidity in the summer (NYC) my hair stays perfect.... This is amazing and I save so much money not buying Ojon products anymore, their shampoo is amazing too, I use both.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair shiny and brings my curls to perfection. Will never go without it iny shower</li>
    <li> I am a licensed hairstylist and I also love natural products.  My usual shampoo/conditioner I buy for salon professionals just isn&#x27;t what it use to be so I was searching for something new. I ordered this conditioner not having too high of hopes as it is very hard to find a good conditioner that is also good/safe for you. I am IN LOVE with this conditioner!  I have thick/dry hair and I also color it.  I need something that will really penetrate and untangle. This exceeded my expectations!  It glided through my hair easily and in the shower I used a wide tooth comb to evenly distribute and untangle. It combed right through!  After my shower, I usually have bad knots in my hair underneath at the base of my neck.  Not anymore!  This conditioner actually got rid of those knots.  My hair feels so healthy and is not weighted down at all!  It is a miracle.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this and please don&#x27;t ever change the formula.  It is fantastic!  Do not hesitate to purchase this...your hair will thank you!  It&#x27;s been over a week since I have been using this daily and I get the same great result each day.  I will never sell my clients synthetic/chemical ridden shampoos/conditioners but I will be telling them about Maple Holistics!  Wondering if I could carry these in my salon?</li>
    <li> This is a nice all natural conditioner that makes my color treated hair with scalp issues soft and manageable. If anything, my hair might be too soft occasionally. I use it with Maple Holistics Tea Tree oil shampoo. As other reviewers have mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all, and that is really the only drawback of this conditioner.</li>
    <li> After 1 1/2 years of serious itching and a horrible rash along my shoulders and chest,  and no help whatsoever from three dermatologists, a sales clerk at a cosmetics store recommended that I try a shampoo with no sulfates. I found Maple Holistics Agran shampoo with no sulfates on Amazon, tried it for a week, and the itching has stopped and the rash has almost disappeared. I&#x27;ve since ordered several more bottles.</li>
    <li> This conditioner leaves my hair feeling so soft and light. My hair is even less frizzy after using. Very happy with this purchase and will be back for more when this bottle is gone.</li>
    <li> My hair is so dry and damaged,using this conditioner has made my hair soft and manageable, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I want to treat my body better and I know that shampoo is full of harsh chemicals that harm your hair. I heard many recommendations about argan oil, and this seemed to be the best out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only owned this product for a day and used it once, so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle. But I can say that my hair does feel different! A good different. I don&#x27;t know what most people prefer as far as scent goes, but I love that this conditioner doesn&#x27;t have a scent. For me, mixing deodorant, body wash, cologne, conditioner and the shampoo scents is pointless unless they all smell the same. Too many scents to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont shampoo every day either, after reading it is much better no to and that conditioning is good to do everyday so that your hair retains the oils.&lt;br /&gt;Im excited to try this product every day and see how I benefit.</li>
    <li> This works great as a deep conditioning treatment for a while, longer the better. Can be a bit of a down fall, because I personally need to leave it on for at least a half an hour. I find that coconut oil pairs well with it. Love that it doesn&#x27;t have a powerful scent, and it helped my hair recover from a bleaching. Overall, nice.</li>
    <li> Great product. I will be buying again from Maple Holistics. I love the natural ingredients, and it makes my hair feel beautiful.</li>
    <li> Works nice on my very long hair.</li>
    <li> great product.....i love it</li>
    <li> Having used high-end, name brand products for years, and having been a former stylist, I am extremely picky about what I use on my hair. I was feeling bored with my conditioner and wanted to give something more natural a try. I chose this based on the great reviews, and I was so pleasantly surprised! My hair is sooooo soft and shiny! I was concerned it would feel greasy due to the Argan oil and the fact that my hair was so soft. But I was able to go about 5 days without washing my hair without it getting greasy at all! (I can typically go about 3 days) This is definitely my new go to conditioner and I will be telling my friends!</li>
    <li> This is pretty decent conditioner.  I love the ingredients but overall, I just didn&#x27;t find it to be moisturizing enough.  The bottle is small and it&#x27;s not cheap but it just didn&#x27;t last long for me.  I have thick, semi long hair and I felt like my hair just soaked this stuff up so quickly.  Probably a good product if you have thin hair or just don&#x27;t need a lot of extra moisture but it didn&#x27;t work well for my needs.</li>
    <li> Not that crazy about it, didn&#x27;t care for the smell, not what I expect from Argan Oil. I won&#x27;t re-order, but that&#x27;s just me, you may love it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves hair smooth, but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Pureology for at least 10 years, but recently, the size I liked became unavailable, so I looked around here on Amazon for a product to condition my hair while protecting the color, and this one had good reviews so I thought to try it.  So far, so good, it does leave my dry hair feeling softer, more like that post-salon treatment than the Pureology.  I really like the price, the size, and so far, the product.  Scent it benign, so no problems there.  As long as the color from my hair does not fade any faster than it has in the past, I will definitely re-purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this conditioner because you don&#x27;t need a lot of it. It spreads nicely through hair. I rinse it out and my hair is smooth and has a gentle &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; curl, which is what I like. My husband has curly hair too and he doesn&#x27;t rinse it out, he uses it as a leave-in and gets similar good results with his &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; salt n&#x27; pepper hair. :)</li>
    <li> Item as described, love this conditioner!</li>
    <li> I have always used the hair products I can get with coupons at the drug store. This is the first Natural type of conditioner I have bought and I can tell the difference! It&#x27;s not slimy and just after four days, my dandruff has really decreased. It is fragrance free. I can wear black and not worry about shaking the dandruff off. And I&#x27;m really surprised I could tell the difference. I only gave it a four star since I have not used any other to compare with.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Not too expensive, not too heavy, not too much junk in it.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing this product; It is most effective on dry curly ethnic hair!</li>
    <li> Good product, smells good.</li>
    <li> Works well and smells great. I have very thick, dry, and frizzy hair. My hair soaks this conditioner up.</li>
    <li> Unscented and moisturizing. Though, it being so thin and unscented makes it hard to tell how much you have in your hair. It&#x27;s also not very slick, so, again, I could never tell if I needed more or not. If you have tight curls or coils and are looking for a good co-wash or something to use after shampooing, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. This would work well as a leave-in or a daily conditioner, though; Or even a base for making your own conditioner.</li>
    <li> love it wil buy more when i ru out</li>
    <li> Used this after using the argan oil shampoo and it made my hair feel fabulous.  I have thick, frizzy color processed hair. After blow drying, my hair is extremely soft and bouncy.  Would highly recommend trying.  My order arrived promptly and this company has excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> My teen daughter uses this shampoo and conditioner and loves it!  She washes  and flat irons her hair every day,  and this Argan  oil shampoo and conditioner keeps her hair in good condition.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Was literally stalking UPS for this to be delivered lol I used it as soon as i got it, Amazing!!!! Its natural and homeopathic from what i can see on the ingredients list no parabens my hair is AMAZING like its so soft and i used this after dying my hair jet black to kinda put back any oils and moisture that i may have lost... Will become my go to product :)</li>
    <li> This conditioner is just ok. It smells pretty good with a light vanilla scent but I didn&#x27;t really feel or see an improvement in my hair after using it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to really penetrate the hair as I expected from the list of great ingredients. Overall, I am pretty disapointed with this product and have returned to using regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on my hair, great pure ingredients, and makes my hair feel healthy and happy.</li>
    <li> Just used once and did not get rid of frizz , but hair seemed softer.</li>
    <li> Might have a new favorite natural conditioner!</li>
    <li> Once again, Maple Holistics has more than exceeded my expectations ....&lt;br /&gt;I have been using their Argan Shampoo along with their Silk 18 Conditioner with wonderful results and was curious to see if some of their other hair care products were also as good ....&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this Argan Conditioner and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;I alternate it with the Silk 18 conditioner as well as alternating between the Argan Shampoo and now the Hydrate Shampoo as well ....&lt;br /&gt;My hair and I are very happy and have finally found peace with these Maple Holistic products.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!  I live in Las Vegas and have fine hair which both contribute to my hair being dry and brittle on the ends.  I just recently purchased and used this product and, after only one use, my hair is soft and the dryness is gone.  I love the rich thick formula with no fragrance added.  I really am grateful to have found this product.  Thank you, Charlie :)</li>
    <li> Okay, a little background: my hair is 2 feet long and very thick. Therefore, it tangles quite easily in the shower, and has a difficult time holding in moisture (it&#x27;s healthy, but retaining moisture is not a strong suit). I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners throughout the ages, and I usually have to settle for a less expensive one because my hair drinks in conditioner like no other. One that had been working was Dove&#x27;s Moisturizing conditioner, and I liked it (still do) but I noticed what my hair likes best is argan oil (I use an organic one ones my hair is dry for shine, moisture, and to prevent flyways). I researched which conditioners with argan oil had the most success with hair like mine, and this one popped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;I used my Dove Moisture shampoo, then I used this. Normally, I need a handful of conditioner to get anywhere with my hair, but I tried about a tablespoon of this to start off with since I never tried an argan conditioner before. It slid through my hair like butter, and when I finger combed my hair after 5 minutes, my fingers ran through my hair like butter as well! I was quite surprised! Normally, I have at least a few tangles stop my fingers that call for either more conditioner or a little extra time. I had neither! I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe it! That much smoothness from so little? Wow! I thought it was a fluke, but it did the same thing the next time I used it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair dried, it was still smooth, and already shiny with no flyaways! I didn&#x27;t even need my argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I haven&#x27;t seen what happens when you blow dry your hair or straighten it after using the product, but considering how well it looks after an air dry (which takes me a long time) I don&#x27;t think heat would change the result much. They suggest waiting to dry your hair for at least 15 minutes after getting out of the shower, and that&#x27;s probably good advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside? 8 oz is not very much for hair like mine, and I&#x27;ll have to rebuy it soon, but I think it&#x27;s definitely worth it!mine, and I&#x27;ll have to rebuy it soon, but I think it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural, haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement on my hair though</li>
    <li> Since turning 40 it seems everything has changed when it has come to my hair, and as we all know if you are having a bad hair day well we are having a bad day! Turning to a holistic approach I found Maple Holistics and actually love them!  This Argan Oil Conditioner is great, even for everyday use!  It isn&#x27;t too heavy and it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell. It is a great buy and worth trying!  My hair is much more manageable and has a shiny finish.</li>
    <li> My hair is really curly and tens to be super tangled after I shower, making it really difficult and time consuming to brush out. So I ordered this conditioner in the hopes that it would really condition my hair and leave it smooth and shiny. I am SO happy that it has done just that! I&#x27;m not too surprised though because you can&#x27;t go wrong with all the amazing essential organic oils that have used I&#x27;m this product. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. My hair is past my shoulders and straight. I use both the shampoo and conditioner and love them. I was looking to change to a product that I would feel comfortable putting on my hair all the time, and this is it. I don&#x27;t like my hair, to the point I am ready to chop it off. I never wear it down just because it drives me nuts. Since using this, I am noticing that I am playing with my hair all the time, twirling it on my finger, and just running my hands through it. It is so freaking soft! It almost could make me consider keeping it long. Two thumbs up for this stuff, totally worth every penny.  Love, love, love.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice so far and I love it. It is soft on my hair and makes it shiny and beautiful. The cheap price is a nice bonus!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the conditioner for a few weeks. So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. Looking forward to trying the shampoo</li>
    <li> I bought this Argon oil conditioner to go with the Degrease conditioner from Maple Holistics. I was surprised at the size of the bottle. I thought it was going to be larger, but then again the image on Amazon and the bottle itself does not tell you how many ounces it contains. The conditioner went on nicely like most other conditioners, making my hair feel silky when rinsing in the shower. A comb went through my hair with ease after I got out. I loved getting a little showering tip card with my order. I decided to follow it and not dry my hair for about 10 - 15 minutes after my shower. My hair was smooth and felt strong. The conditioner did not weigh it down, but did not add volume. There also isn&#x27;t a very strong scent after using. I couldn&#x27;t really smell anything, which isn&#x27;t bad to be honest. I slept on my hair and when I woke up it looked pretty much the same with no frizziness. I only had to straighten my bangs back into place. Overall, I really like this conditioner. Mainly because of the ingredients and how it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like some other conditioners.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this conditioner!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and works extremely well with the Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner, my daughter has VERY curly hair and these products are the only ones that I have found that manage her hair! The delivery is usually very fast as well, and the product is simply fascinating</li>
    <li> I admit, I made myself hold back on writing this.  I usually get all excited and &amp;#34;go for it&amp;#34;. My hair is VERY important to me. I&#x27;ve been on a like long search (it feels that way) for a product that did what it touted it would.  Oh my gosh! This is the greatest. I have used this over and over and I love the way my hair looks and feels. Best part: my husband doesn&#x27;t tell me my hair feels like horse hair.  And I admit, it did. So, yes get this and get more. Treat everyone you love to it, put it in stockings this coming Christmas, do it &amp;#34;just cuz&amp;#34;. I will.</li>
    <li> so far so good.  this is very gentle conditioner.  I have sensitive scalp and this is not irritating at all.  ok conditioner for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair was so damaged that i didn&#x27;t know what to do.. So a friend of mine show me this argan oil conditioner and change my hair completely.. What i do is very simple i put this conditioner in my hair and let stand for about 10 minutes.. It really works.. Now my hair is so shine and healthy.. Recomended this product for all the woman and man who have dry and damaged hair...</li>
    <li> In general, I love Maple Holistics products, so when I saw they released a new conditioner I eagerly purchased it. I have used it a few times and am not sold on it. When I first used their Silk 18, I was sold from the first use. This argan conditioner is just...okay. Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell, and doesn&#x27;t really condition my hair, at least not as well as Silk 18. I&#x27;ve swapped this bottle of Argan Oil conditioner with my daughter&#x27;s bottle of Silk 18. We have different hair types (mine is thin, shoulder length, and wavy...her&#x27;s is long, thick, and straight)...so I&#x27;ll see if she likes it better than I did.</li>
    <li> I recently found out I am allegic to fragrance.  Researched and found this product.  I have ony used three times, but so far pleased.  The shampoo and conditioner require small amounts to work effectively.  My hair has body and shine.  So far, I have been pleased.</li>
