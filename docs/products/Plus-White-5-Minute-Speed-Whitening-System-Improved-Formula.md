      <li>I like that the mouthpiece is all inclusive for the top AND bottom teeth.</li>
      <li>My teeth look dramatically better.</li>
      <li>Hi there, so I buyed this product after many reviews and utube clips on it.</li>
      <li>Anyways, if you want more info try watching this video, which is the one that convinced me in buying(.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2pFAr6hgIEM)</li>
      <li>Once or twice a week for 15 minutes at most.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>Works much better.</li>
      <li>Yes &#x3D;), cause If find that it&#x27;s a non-hurting solution (compared to laser stuff or led light) and cheap as well!</li>
      <li>Thank you so much everything is good the way I wanted.</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s because the gel WAS working, and after that every application was smooth.</li>
      <li>Step one directs brushing first, so I was able to incorporate the protection from my sensitive-teeth paste.  </li>
      <li>for the price and the short time - it really works and looks great</li>
      <li>I think I added too much, and on top of that the guard is kind of big but</li>
      <li>I no longer try to hide my teeth when I smile.</li>
      <li>First off, I saw this mentioned in a youtube video.</li>
      <li>After the first three days I noticed a difference, as did my wife and granddaughter.  </li>
      <li>Not movie star bright white, but a normal looking white color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pretty decent system for the price.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and it seemed promising</li>
      <li>Much whiter and healthier looking.  </li>
      <li>it works very well.</li>
      <li>Really wishing I would have gotten this from amazon.</li>
      <li>while I read my emails, no bad taste, can&#x27;t say enough about this!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend getting this.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>but i&#x27;m holding out hope that i&#x27;ll start seeing results after a few more applications.  </li>
      <li>I now actually purposely have a toothy smile in pictures.</li>
      <li>At first I did use it once daily for the 15-20 time frame.&lt;br /&gt;Around</li>
      <li>I started to loose hope beacause some of the videos reviews I watched were stating that it did work from the very first application, but I suppose it depends from person to person.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ll even brush with it occasionally to make sure its getting down into the crevices between teeth.</li>
      <li>The tray is kind of big and doesn&#x27;t really hit my bottom teeth (no perfect bite for me, like most people I have a slight, normal, overbite)</li>
      <li>Took a risk with this and am pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
      <li>still up in the air because i&#x27;ve only used it 3 times so far.  </li>
      <li>Not a good buy, though product is fine.</li>
      <li>even after the first use, I noticed my teeth are a little healthier looking.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m nearly through an entire tube after several applications and daily brushing.</li>
      <li>Too high a price compared to all other chain stores.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Hi there, so I buyed this product after many reviews and utube clips on it. I like it, and I feel like it&#x27;s working but it needs time and repeatitive applications. Initially, when I tried it it did sting a bit but I think it&#x27;s because the gel WAS working, and after that every application was smooth. I started to loose hope beacause some of the videos reviews I watched were stating that it did work from the very first application, but I suppose it depends from person to person. Anyways, if you want more info try watching this video, which is the one that convinced me in buying(.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2pFAr6hgIEM) Oh, and it says &amp;#34;5min&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not like you will get ur whitening done in 5min, it STARTS working in 5min. Depending on how stained your teeth are, you can even leave it up to 20/25 min. Would I buy again? Yes &#x3D;), cause If find that it&#x27;s a non-hurting solution (compared to laser stuff or led light) and cheap as well! You will just need patience. If you have that, you&#x27;re good to go! Shipping was good, it took exactly 1 week, way faster than what they told me it would take!(so thumbs up for that!)</li>
    <li> Thank you so much everything is good the way I wanted. I revived it on time.</li>
    <li> Yet to be seen. I&#x27;m nearly through an entire tube after several applications and daily brushing. If there are any results, they are hardly detectable.</li>
    <li> Awesome whitening kit...&lt;br /&gt;It fits over every tooth...! I am 2 shades whiter since I received it...!!</li>
    <li> Really wishing I would have gotten this from amazon. It&#x27;s  $19.99 at CVS. I just bought it today. Don&#x27;t use a lot of the gel, just enough. It will foam up on its own. I think I added too much, and on top of that the guard is kind of big but even after the first use, I noticed my teeth are a little healthier looking. Can&#x27;t wait to see the end results, I&#x27;ll definitely do an update</li>
    <li> after 10 days use no significant results ... I can feel no change in colour of teeth or whitening effect</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for us...</li>
    <li> It works but it is not a 5 minute whitener. You use it two times a day for 14 days for 5-15 minutes</li>
    <li> Works well, but a little slow. I&#x27;ve seen results, but it can be quite irritating to the gums. I often have to stop using it just when it&#x27;s really starting to work because my gums look swollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price keeps me coming back.</li>
    <li> First off, I saw this mentioned in a youtube video. I read the reviews and it seemed promising so I bought it. At Walmart. For 9 bucks (had a one dollar coupon on the box).&lt;br /&gt;I bought it in October 2013. It is now April 2014. I have never done the recommended twice a day use. At first I did use it once daily for the 15-20 time frame.&lt;br /&gt;Around the 14 days I was already getting comments that my teeth looked whiter. Mind you I had some severely yellow teeth to start.&lt;br /&gt;After that I began using it sporadically. Once or twice a week for 15 minutes at most. My teeth look dramatically better. I no longer try to hide my teeth when I smile. No longer cover my mouth for pictures. I now actually purposely have a toothy smile in pictures. The self confidence gained from no longer having yellow teeth is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My mom is now wanting me to get her the kit so she can start using it.&lt;br /&gt;And its not just wishful thinking. I took before and after pictures and have compared them. The difference is clear.&lt;br /&gt;If you have yellowed teeth I highly recommend getting this. Just don&#x27;t use it once or twice and expect instant results. You have to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con? The tray is kind of big and doesn&#x27;t really hit my bottom teeth (no perfect bite for me, like most people I have a slight, normal, overbite) so I wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted on my bottom teeth, especially along my gum line. So I began applying the gel with a q-tip on the bottom. Works much better. And I&#x27;ll even brush with it occasionally to make sure its getting down into the crevices between teeth. Something I hadn&#x27;t thought to try until I bought a refill tube of the gel and the paper inside listed it as an application option.</li>
    <li> Too high a price compared to all other chain stores. Not a good buy, though product is fine.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth &amp; had issues with previous whitening systems.  Took a risk with this and am pleasantly surprised with the results.  Step one directs brushing first, so I was able to incorporate the protection from my sensitive-teeth paste.  Then I found that applying the gel to the walls instead of the floor of the tray provided excellent coverage of the front of the teeth, rather than initiating contact with the grinding areas.  Started seeing results after only a few days of use.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I tried, so can&#x27;t compare to others that are out there.&lt;br /&gt;I am 52, drink red wine and coffee, and had noticeably yellow teeth.  The dentist always says I have very healthy teeth so I didn&#x27;t worry about it until I got a front tooth crown, which was whiter than the surrounding teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions, doing twice a day for two weeks.  After the first three days I noticed a difference, as did my wife and granddaughter.  I can say in just two weeks it has dramatically improved the look of my teeth.  Much whiter and healthier looking.  Not movie star bright white, but a normal looking white color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am still looking for a little whiter, so will keep using 3 or 4 times per week.  Am hoping to drop down to the maintenance levels of once a week soon.</li>
    <li> this product is great, been using it for just 4 days and my smile it wonderful! Great for cig stains and I drink a lot of tea, all gone! 5+ Stars! I used it for 15-20 mins. while I read my emails, no bad taste, can&#x27;t say enough about this!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem help at all.</li>
    <li> still up in the air because i&#x27;ve only used it 3 times so far.  but i&#x27;m holding out hope that i&#x27;ll start seeing results after a few more applications.  i usually leave it on for around 10 minutes and there is not much sensitivity afterwards, so that&#x27;s definitely a plus.</li>
    <li> Love love love! it works very well. I noticed a different after just 2 days! Will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Not as advertised!  I thot it was a jit with toothpaste in a box not a baggie with a mouthpiece &amp; tube of goo</li>
    <li> Absolute favorite of all times!!! works perfectly and effectively. My tooth are naturally white but because I drink a lot of coffee (Pharmacy student here) they started to get yellower. I have been using this product since last year and I use it when ever I want and I always get perfect result and it only takes me 10-15 mins.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for the second time as I type this review. Pretty decent system for the price. I like that the mouthpiece is all inclusive for the top AND bottom teeth. It got my teeth white. I have a little noticeable decay on my bottom tooth that I was hoping it would fix, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep using it to fix that. Otherwise, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> amazing.  for the price and the short time - it really works and looks great</li>
