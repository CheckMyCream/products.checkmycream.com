      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>so keep in mind to maybe use a powder on top.</li>
      <li>(though I have bought many foundations that are two or three times this price).  </li>
      <li>Saved $5 over best local sale.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not too sure how it would work on oily skin, might be too silky.</li>
      <li>That being said, I love this foundation.</li>
      <li>I wanted something that would give good coverage, make my skin look better than it is, give a soft glow</li>
      <li>Easy to dispense.</li>
      <li>Skin feels great with this on too, not greasy, just soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>No lines, no clumping, just even smooth coverage.</li>
      <li>It goes on light as a feather.  </li>
      <li>Feels light.</li>
      <li>It blend SUPER easily.</li>
      <li>For a while I was just applying it with clean hands</li>
      <li>Full disclosure, I am NOT a make up expert.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to wear foundation, but the older I got the more</li>
      <li>Easy &amp; fast to apply.</li>
      <li>I have a few age spots and it seems to do a really great job covering them up.  </li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing and smooth.</li>
      <li>I just have to say that prior to the BzzCampaign, I was strictly a tinted moisturizer kind of girl.  </li>
      <li>and so far I love it</li>
      <li>Just the right touch and feel for makeup.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for the right foundation for YEARS.</li>
      <li>Feels soft and coverage is good until you take it off later.</li>
      <li>and sometimes it stings a little on my face, but when applied well it looks good.</li>
      <li>but recently I switched to a stippling brush for application and it looks so much better that way.</li>
      <li>so most makeups, especially ones with moisturizer, fell as if they are just sitting on my skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks BzzAgent!</li>
      <li>This is the first one I have found that doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
      <li>Thanks Covergirl :) finally, the search for foundation is over!</li>
      <li>This makeup pretty much blends itself so I don&#x27;t have that issue.</li>
      <li>I have used the Covergirl/Olay Simply Ageless for several years and love its abiltiy to cover discolorations in the skin and still look light.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes that this product would do the same with a more luminous appearance.  </li>
      <li>I cant vouch for the long term benefits it claims as I haven&#x27;t tried it that long, but olay is usually pretty good</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write a review unless I am extremely impressed or extremely disgruntled.</li>
      <li>so most other foundations streak or leave spots because I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t do a good job with them.</li>
      <li>It only takes a little for great coverage.  </li>
      <li>I wish it lasted a little longer throughout the day, but overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>was worried about ordering a color online, but beige buff blends really well.</li>
      <li>I have mild rosacea (blotchy red patches on skin, along jawline)</li>
      <li>Amazon Prime highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like wearing foundation and rarely do, but occasionally my skin breaks out</li>
      <li>(like I am young again!)</li>
      <li>Give it a try, its not expensive compared to the cosmetic aisle stuff in the big department stores.</li>
      <li>Light weight feels moist, a little color/coverage, plus sunscreen all in one.</li>
      <li>so I am always looking for a foundation that provides coverage that will stay put and also look natural and blend</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Did my scars complete vanish, no, of course not.</li>
      <li>I am an 19 year old with combination skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m too old to have it change my skin, since I am 69.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cjs</li>
      <li>I have pretty dry skin, and this goes on like silk.</li>
      <li>I have been using this on and off between trying other products and always return to this...stays fresh all day.</li>
      <li>I have really dry skin, and it seemed like no matter how much I moisturized, my skin would look flakey after putting on makeup.</li>
      <li>First of all, my worry about it feeling heavy and pore clogging was completely unjustified!  </li>
      <li>The make up I have worn for 20 years doesn&#x27;t cover enough old age spots on my face anymore</li>
      <li>/&gt;After using the CoverGirl and Olay Tonerehab for several weeks, I really find my skin IS softer and less wrinkley  than before.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing foundation and rarely do, but occasionally my skin breaks out and this product is great. Feels so silky going on and lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I have been using this makeup for years, but purchased it from Amazon because it was cheaper. I have oily skin so most makeups, especially ones with moisturizer, fell as if they are just sitting on my skin. I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing makeup with this on. Since trying the Covergirl with tone rehab I haven&#x27;t worn another kind of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I didn&#x27;t make it through puberty without multiple acne scars. The dark spots and scars made me feel like hiding my face under a ton of makeup. Now I do not have a problem being see sans makeup. Did my scars complete vanish, no, of course not. But they are not as noticeable as they once were. I do not use any other lotions or potions on my face so I believe this product deserves the credit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to wear foundation, but the older I got the more I needed it and every one I tried was cakey or oily or looked to fake.  I decided to try this one a week ago and so far I love it it blends great and is creamy without being greasy, it also doesn&#x27;t look like a mask!  I cant vouch for the long term benefits it claims as I haven&#x27;t tried it that long, but olay is usually pretty good so hopefully that works too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used the Covergirl/Olay Simply Ageless for several years and love its abiltiy to cover discolorations in the skin and still look light.  I had high hopes that this product would do the same with a more luminous appearance.  Not so.  This is not a concealing product, though goes on silkier.  Looks like you&#x27;re wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> I had to buy it at a retail store because I ordered the wrong color.  I do like the color I have now.  I knew that was the risk I was taking trying to purchase makeup online.</li>
    <li> Good coverage. Easy to dispense. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this foundation! was worried about ordering a color online, but beige buff blends really well. Saved $5 over best local sale. Amazon Prime highly recommended. Get a ROI in gas savings in several orders.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this foundation...it goes on so smoothly and feels wonderful on the skin.  I have a few age spots and it seems to do a really great job covering them up.  Will definitely buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> Light weight feels moist, a little color/coverage, plus sunscreen all in one. Easy &amp; fast to apply.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Came 2 in a pack, bonus!</li>
    <li> use this product every morning</li>
    <li> This is a good product, doesn&#x27;t cake up on face at all.  Feels soft and coverage is good until you take it off later.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on and off between trying other products and always return to this...stays fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write a review unless I am extremely impressed or extremely disgruntled. Well, in this case, I am extremely impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for the right foundation for YEARS. I&#x27;ve tried powders, liquids, mousses, whips, BB cream, hybrids, sticks, tinted lotion... everything. This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried and I will be sticking with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 28 and have combination skin-- dry in places, oily in the t-zone, still prone to breakouts if I&#x27;m not careful with my skincare routine. I have mild rosacea (blotchy red patches on skin, along jawline) so I am always looking for a foundation that provides coverage that will stay put and also look natural and blend in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tone Rehab gives amazing coverage that is blendable (you can apply it thicker over blemishes if you need to) and it doesn&#x27;t oxidize on my skin (turn orange after setting). It feels like silk, smells nice, stays put (doesn&#x27;t rub off or melt) and after using it for about a month now I think it&#x27;s improving my skin overall!! I love this stuff. Thanks Covergirl :) finally, the search for foundation is over!</li>
    <li> Full disclosure, I am NOT a make up expert. That being said, I love this foundation. It blend SUPER easily. I&#x27;m horrible about applying my makeup so most other foundations streak or leave spots because I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t do a good job with them. This makeup pretty much blends itself so I don&#x27;t have that issue. No irritation for me. Feels light. Covers my blemishes fairly well.</li>
    <li> Love CoverGirl and Olay product combinations.  Just the right touch and feel for makeup.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin this is the only make up I use and I never have a break out from</li>
    <li> The make up I have worn for 20 years doesn&#x27;t cover enough old age spots on my face anymore so I thought I would give this a try. Hey, I saw Ellen wearing it and pitching it and she looks great; (I know I know she wears stage makeup on TV) and the idea this would tone and rehabilitate my skin was catchy. I bit and I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the CoverGirl and Olay Tonerehab for several weeks, I really find my skin IS softer and less wrinkley  than before. The makeup goes on very smoothly and feels so silky. The color is an identical match to my skin. No lines, no clumping, just even smooth coverage. Give it a try, its not expensive compared to the cosmetic aisle stuff in the big department stores.</li>
    <li> I really liked using it but my brown spots did not get lighter or disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try the CC make-up and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m too old to have it change my skin, since I am 69.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cjs</li>
    <li> Excelent Product, 100% recommended...</li>
    <li> I have always been a covergirl. Even after trying department store products I still prefer covergirl. This one lasts all day. No greasy feeling. Nice complexion all day.</li>
    <li> Product came as pictured, wonderful perfect shade, blends well, very light can barely tell you&#x27;re wearing make up, love it!</li>
    <li> This is like the best foundation I have ever had. I ordered the Buff and it looks great.</li>
    <li> This makeup is amazing.  It only takes a little for great coverage.  Skin feels great with this on too, not greasy, just soft and smooth.  I also use Olay moisturizer first, so I&#x27;m not sure if this helps too, but I&#x27;m hooked on this foundation.</li>
    <li> I just have to say that prior to the BzzCampaign, I was strictly a tinted moisturizer kind of girl.  I didn&#x27;t want to feel like my face was completely covered and unable to breathe.  Today, I am a total convert after two weeks using CoverGirl &amp; Olay Tone Rehab 2-in-1 Foundation.  First of all, my worry about it feeling heavy and pore clogging was completely unjustified!  It goes on light as a feather.  I was TRULY amazed by the coverage!  With the tinted moisturizer, I needed to use a concealer on blemishes before putting on the tinted moisturizer and then, the blemish always ended up looking caked up with crap.  I hated it.  One tiny little pump of the Rehab 2-in-1 Foundation and it even covers my occasional blemishes without an additional concealer product!  This stuff also stays in place all day long.  I am extremely happy with this product and thankful for the opportunity to try it out for free.  I would never have spent the money on something I was unsure about...especially since I had preconceived notions of \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; being heavy and pore clogging!  Now, I will continue to buy this product even after this full-size BzzCampaign sample runs out!  Thanks BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> This is seriously my FAVORITE FOUNDATION EVER! I have pretty dry skin, and this goes on like silk. It is very moisturizing and smooth. Gives skin a flawless look. I&#x27;m not too sure how it would work on oily skin, might be too silky. For my skin it&#x27;s perfectttttt</li>
    <li> I am 65 with fairly nice skin but obviously some wrinkles and age spots.  I wanted something that would give good coverage, make my skin look better than it is, give a soft glow (like I am young again!) not look fake and not cost a fortune (though I have bought many foundations that are two or three times this price).  I highly recommend this product.  It does everything I wanted/needed and I am very happy with it and would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how smoothly this goes on! I have really dry skin, and it seemed like no matter how much I moisturized, my skin would look flakey after putting on makeup. This is the first one I have found that doesn&#x27;t do that. I wish it lasted a little longer throughout the day, but overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I am an 19 year old with combination skin. I started using this foundation at 16 after picking it up at a drug store and while it isn&#x27;t the best out there, it works for me. I don&#x27;t know how moisturizing it is and sometimes it stings a little on my face, but when applied well it looks good. It does have a slight orangey tint so I only wear it when I am tanned. For a while I was just applying it with clean hands but recently I switched to a stippling brush for application and it looks so much better that way. I like how it doesn&#x27;t look or feel heavy or cakey. It does start to melt off my face if I start to sweat though so keep in mind to maybe use a powder on top.</li>
