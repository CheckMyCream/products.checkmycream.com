      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>It works better than anything I&#x27;ve bought in the store, including callous shavers.  </li>
      <li>The best part is it only takes a couple of minutes.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Finally able to chip away at years of callus buildup.</li>

      <li>I love this tool.</li>

      <li>Hands down, the best product of its kind I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>I found starting with lighter pressure worked best, as it can easily be overdone causing sensitivity.</li>
      <li>First, this is a file - think cheese grater - you do not want to file away the good skin from you</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wow! This thing is great! I have 58 year old often-barefoot man&#x27;s feet, and first use of this was astounded. At same time, bought much higher priced rechargeable electric roller-type skin buffer, but wish I saved that $80, which does much less. I love this cheese-grater type device, which rapidly removes dead skin from my rough feet. A little lotion, and voila! Much smoother feet. I&#x27;ll be using this occasionally, but not too much, so as not to damage my skin from working it too hard. Don&#x27;t need to scrape myself. But I highly recommend this product! I&#x27;m buying these as Xmas presents this year.</li>
    <li> I love this. I like that you use it dry so it saves me time by eliminating soaking my feet. Use over a towel or outside, this thing really gets the dry skin off. Be careful not to go too far. It&#x27;s easy to take off too much skin if you aren&#x27;t paying attention.</li>
    <li> Best pedicure and callous remover on earth!&lt;br /&gt;It removes even the hardest skin❤️</li>
    <li> Awesome, awesome, awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rarely do I feel so passionate about any item I buy on Amazon. But this is one of those rare exceptions! Forget a pumice stone or anything similar. This pedicure rasp scrapes off the dead skin on your heel and other areas of your foot with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Extreme Efficiency!&lt;br /&gt;- Extreme Effectiveness!&lt;br /&gt;- Extreme Speed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures would be gross, but this product is incredibly useful! I used to pick and peel at the dead skin on my heels for years. Pumice stones took so much effort and provided such lackluster results. This item literally blows them away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, be careful though. Don&#x27;t go too overboard. If you do, it&#x27;ll hurt when you walk for a day or so. What I did was scrape all around the heels of my feet at all angles necessary while basically applying as little pressure as possible from the device. As soon as I started to get hardly any shavings falling off and started to feel the point of friction I stopped. This still results in a 95% effectiveness coverage area while also not causing pain. I messed up one little spot on one of my heels and although it&#x27;s not incredibly painful nor bleeding, it is uncomfortable. This would also happen when I would manually pick and peel at it though and I know the discomfort will be gone tomorrow. I also know how to prevent that from happening in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so blown away by this product I will be buying one for my closest family members. It&#x27;s that good!</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully.  Within minutes I had smooth heels.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this sooner!  I wouldn&#x27;t have had to pay to get callus removal during my pedicure.  This is a miracle worker...cleans my heels SO well...but be careful not to go too gung-ho with it.  It works SO well that a part of you wants to see how much you can remove...but that&#x27;s not so good for your heels as they will crack open cause you cleaned them raw...  :)</li>
    <li> Works just like the salon pedicure. Love it!</li>
    <li> Item worked well..until it broke..great product, but cheap plastic handle...</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Made my feet worse than they were before. They appear to be peeled and became like this the first few seconds! I started out doing it gently and ended up doing it roughly, nothing helped. DO NOT RECCOMEND.</li>
    <li> I used a Ped-Egg for years and thought it was fine until I received this pedicure rasp.  This is so much easier to use.  Much quicker with a lot less effort.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will stay this sharp, but at such a good price, I won&#x27;t mind having to replace it periodically.</li>
    <li> This is made by a company that makes kitchen utensils (cheese graters included). They did a great job with this thing. Read and follow the instructions though. It doesn&#x27;t work well on wet feet, so make sure they are dry. It is quite large, which makes it fast to use. I found starting with lighter pressure worked best, as it can easily be overdone causing sensitivity. I definitely moisturize after using it. But it does what it said it would do, and is getting the dry calluses off my heels.</li>
    <li> Love! Never knew something like this existed. So great and easy.</li>
    <li> It worked like a champ once, bu was blunt after that.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Wanted one because I would see it being used when I would get a mani &amp; pedi.  Now I can extend the time between visits.</li>
    <li> I have a PediEgg, and believe the other reviewers when they say, this is night and day different. This will take off dead and calloused skin fast! Be careful! It is easy to go overboard and take off too much. I love it. You don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries or motors slowing down, etc. this is a great product for helping those of us who love to go bare foot in the spring and summer have pretty feet doing it!</li>
    <li> It works great for removing the dry skin from my feet. I&#x27;ve used if several times already and it works great!</li>
    <li> After the great reviews I decided to give it a try. It works great, taking off lots of dead skin. I could see how you could hurt yourself if you over-do it, but it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll probably want to use one of your sandpapery foot tools that you probably have to finish the job. The rasp removes the dead skin very well, but you&#x27;ll want to smooth it out afterward. I&#x27;m very glad I tried this before buying yet another battery powered tool that probably wouldn&#x27;t have worked.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things to remove thick callus buildup on my feet, but nothing has worked as well as this. I use it at the end of my showers when the dead skin is the softest, and it easily rubs off large visible amounts. My feet are left incredibly smooth afterwards. I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
    <li> Salon quality foot file.  Gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No real drawbacks; this isn&#x27;t something you&#x27;d take on the road with you as it&#x27;s pretty big (hence, &amp;#34;colossal&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must-have grooming tool.</li>
    <li> good product.  Does the job I need it to do.  Happy to have it to show off my summer smooth feet.</li>
    <li> this thing really works I&#x27;ve tried many other products and nothing has worked until I got this I highly recommend the rasp!</li>
    <li> Wow, works really well. I will say that you have to be careful not to offer do it, it shaves off very fine layers of the skin and you may not notice how much you are actually removing. Best product of its kind that I&#x27;ve tried. Pumice stones and sand paper files don&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
    <li> Really effective but be careful.  It is very easy to push too hard and not realize it until the pain sets in later.  This thing bulldozes through layers of callous that would take a regular foot file a lot of back and forth in just a couple of strokes.</li>
    <li> Amazing, works so well and even very rough calloused feet</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best product of its kind I&#x27;ve ever had. After just three days of daily use, my feet are smoother than they&#x27;ve been in years. Be careful... This thing is powerful. So go slow and easy. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. By the way, in my opinion, it works best on dry feet.</li>
    <li> oh my this thing is wonderful!  Really works amazingly well at removing calluses.  You can see it working so you don&#x27;t have to wait for results.  I would recommend doing this on a towel or outside so you don&#x27;t make a huge mess since this literally sands off your calluses.  Another recommendation would be to not overdo it.  It is so easy to go overboard and over &amp;#34;zest&amp;#34; your feet and end up with in pain the next morning.  Overall an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Best $9 I&#x27;ve ever spent!! Better than any salon pedi scrub! You have to try it to believe it!</li>
    <li> Better than PedEgg! More grip and more surface area.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I needed. And the price is amazing. I got gross cracked feet while pregnant, this took it right off! Great product, came quickly and did what it said it would</li>
    <li> I got this because I lost my Ped Egg and couldn&#x27;t find a place that was still selling them. This is much better... however, you need to be careful with it. It requires NO pressure and will take off skin like nobody&#x27;s business, and you will feel almost nothing from it. Far too easy to take too much off. Also, it is huge. I have smaller cheese graters. Great if you need something heavy duty like me... pumice stones and the like are more or less worthless to me.</li>
    <li> Love this....works wonders. Key is to be gentle with first use and not to overdo it!! Also did the filing on dry/non soaked feet. Cannot believe the amount of dead skin that piled up. Very happy with results!!!</li>
    <li> Just like the nail shop, works great!</li>
    <li> Works really well! Nice soft feet!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t find this sooner. DI tried the soaking foot baths, pumice stone in the shower, and foot cream socks overnight. Nothing, I say &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34; works as good as this simple tool!  The review from the &amp;#34;sweet baby Jesus&amp;#34; guy is correct!</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. This thing works so well! Definitely use on dry feet, as it suggests. After reading other reviews, I decided to not go hard the first time using it. I didn&#x27;t do too much the first time because I didn&#x27;t want to end up with sore heels! My feet are super soft after two times of using this. I also think it helps to have a mini one that&#x27;s not so intense for in-shower use and upkeep. I figure I will have to use this about once a month... much better than an expensive pedicure! Remember to lotion nightly! I would definitely recommend this product, and I would buy again if I ever needed to.</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  Just like what they use at the salon on pedicures.  Got all the rough skin off easily and painlessly.</li>
    <li> It works very, very well.</li>
    <li> This item truly works just like the nail salons. It is pretty sharp and gets rid of calluses and rough spots. Great item for the price.</li>
    <li> The wife said this tool has changed her life.  She will not stop talking about how easy it is to use and pretty her feet are now.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! This thing works like a magic. It is much better than what they use in the the salon. I love it so much that I have decided to order 2 more.</li>
    <li> This is great- does the job quickly &amp; easily. I got this after I saw my local salon using one and realized it did much better than my pediegg or emoji at nearly 1/6 the price and doesn&#x27;t need refills- this is a no brainer!</li>
    <li> Finally an at home product.  Works great.  Don&#x27;t go overboard the first day or you will not be walking.  :)  Take your time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find it that much good</li>
    <li> much better than the powered models.  This simple cheese grader is the real deal.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about these but they do work as advertised. They will stand up to being in the shower all of the time since they are made of metal with a plastic handle. Just don&#x27;t use them on dry skin.</li>
    <li> I just found my perfect callus tool! For $9 this is a perfect bargain for those like me, who get rough spots on the back of their feet. I would suggest using this after a bath/shower for the best use.</li>
    <li> When I first took it out of the package I laughed out loud.  It was big and oxy and their was no way it was going to work.  Was I wrong!  The Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp works like no other callus remover on the market.  It did the job and it did it quickly.  So quick that you have to be careful not to overdo it.  You will not regret purchasing this callus remover.....that is how good it is.  Read the rest of the reviews and you will see what I mean.  Caution, use it a little each day and don&#x27;t overdo it.  It would be easy to take too much skin.</li>
    <li> Very cool, works well, tackles rough skin without problem.  Apply gentle pressure until you get the hang of using it so you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;over-scrape&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Wow, this thing really digs in. Much more a serious device than the smaller Walmart one I bought years ago. Works quickly. I was used to taking like 10 or 15 minutes grinding away at my feet. This takes like a minute or two. It&#x27;s got the grip and general size of a comb. Lighter though. Like nothing I&#x27;ve seen in the stores. Very nice, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought on amazon, which sounds stupid because it&#x27;s just a foot file, but it blew my mind. I&#x27;ve used a few other types of pumice stones and foot files and this thing worked 10x better than any of them. I think the key is to follow the directions and use it when your feet are dry, not after a shower. It required like 30 second of light pressure per foot and my heels, which are usually gross and embarrassing even if I file them regularly, look perfect! I was actually amazed. Phenomenal product.</li>
    <li> This is honestly the best item under $10 I have ever purchased in my life.  I have been plagued with bone spurs in my feet for the past 20 years and have been suffering with painful thick calluses mostly on the balls of my feet and toes where the joints are.  I have used other much more expensive battery operated products and cheaper alternatives like pumice stones to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously this thing is just a sharp cheese grater but it worked miracles on my feet.  Because of the thick hard calluses, walking barefooted was more like a limp fest because it was so painful, but not anymore.  Like others have mentioned, don&#x27;t go overboard on the shaving unless you want raw feet the next day, but as you are using it, you realize you don&#x27;t really have to.  You don&#x27;t need to put much pressure on the file and the thick skin just shaves away effortlessly.  Honestly its best to take your time anyway and will be well worth your effort.  It is a little difficult getting in certain angles on your feet due to the shape and size of the tool but it does its job.  If they made a smaller version I would buy that for sure.  Very effective product!</li>
    <li> This thing is the bomb I used to use the pumice brick and it barely worked. I go to the nail shop and they use this on my feet but I only go every two weeks and I wear sandals every single day so my feet dry out and my heels get really bad. So I needed something that was really going to solve all my problems and this foot filer is the truth! As soon as I received my package I used it. Didn&#x27;t soak my feet or anything and now my heels is soft as butter !! AA++</li>
    <li> Best 10$ I ever spent.....my feet love it</li>
    <li> This rasp goes through the callus pretty quick. Be careful not to go to deep.</li>
    <li> Great!!! Holes are a good size to exfoliate but not too deep in one sweep.</li>
    <li> This works great.  The only thing you have to watch is how much pressure you place on this device.  It will scrap your skin.  It does a great job, but be careful.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! This has worked better than anything else I have tried for my horrible cracked feet. Before I would spend what felt like forever scrubbing at my feet with a pumice(Is that how you spell it?)stone and foot file without much success. My heels would still be horrible and cracked and painful, walking around barefoot probably doesnt help. Anyways, nothing really worked until i bought this. The best part is it only takes a couple of minutes. And you dont have to apply much pressure at all for it to work. You must be careful though. The first time I used it I was so happy it was working so well that i took it too far. I didn&#x27;t notice as there was no way to tell and it wasn&#x27;t painful, but later on it hurt,Bad! I mean i could barely put shoes on and walk around. I have used it since then with no pain as now i know when to stop. This is a great product. Worked when nothing else would and worth the price, just be careful with it.</li>
    <li> Ok.. Lots of products out there.. Back to the TV infomercial of the &amp;#34;Pedi-Egg&amp;#34;, which might I add IS absolutely NOTHING like this. I have purchased several products (ie. files, pedi-egg, foot sanders and even a low grade sanding disc for my random orbit sander) JUST to try to get rid of the callouses on my feet so I can WEAR MY SANDALS during summer and not be forced to wear sneakers due to the visions of my feet scaring little children.  So I spent some time on Amazon and was literally about to hit the button on the VERY popular Emjoi foot sander when I read a review that said &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t bother with this, get the Micro-plane Colossal Pedicure Rasp&amp;#34; and rather then spending $60+ on the device and rollers, I took a look. So previously being one who spent close to an hour using the Pedi-joke(egg) and files to try to clean up feet, spending a tad bit of time was no big deal.  This rasp has 2000+ 5 STAR REVIEWS and, most importantly, it cost about $8.. So for $8, I figured before I spend $60, I would give it a shot.. This was probably just a pedi-egg like device with a bigger surface, right?  WRONG WRONG WRONG!!! This thing is the med-evil callous destroyer, the axe for your Zombie feet, the silver bullet for your vampire callouses.. You get the point.. If you look at the picture and THINK it looks like a Pedi-Egg.. Nononono... Far FAR from.  First off, IT IS BIG, Bigger than the normal hand held cheese grater.  Second and MOST important, if you hold it close to the callouses on your feet, they will simply fall off from fear. OK, seriously.. what previously took me close to an hour, now takes 10-15 mins for both feet with DRAMATIC results.  THIS THING WORKS AND WORKS TOO WELL.  At first I simply went about sawing at my foot like I did with the Pedi-egg only to realize that only a min or two later, the callous was WAY gone and I now need a band-aid. Wow does this thing work, USE caution.  First off it does have the pedi-egg like surface that has horizontal &amp;#34;slots&amp;#34; but also has raised and directional edges to quickly and VERY quickly make short work of your callouses.  So after realizing that I was now removing layers of skin beyond the callous, I changed the amount of pressure I was using and between the big toe area, ball of foot and the dreaded heel, in a matter of about 5--7 minutes I HAD MY FOOT BACK like it has never looked before.  This thing is AMAZING. and I am so glad I found that one review that pointed me here.  My feet look great, it took me about 15 mins using this and a Diamoncel buffer (#11) and I ended up with a pile of dead skin in the bottom of the bath tub that looked more like a miniature sand dune movie set than the paltry remains of my previous hour long adventure. I followed this routine up with O&#x27;keeffes Healthy foot cream and the next day my feet felt and looked great.  After a few days of using the cream AM &amp; PM, I will swear up and down that my feet are night and day from when I got the rasp in the mail.  Skip all the eggs, foot sanders, foot files, etc and GET THIS.  If you have REAL bad callouses, this is your foot revolution! Just remember NOT to go at it like you are trying to sand a stone, you will end up having sore feet wrapped in gauze.  Glad I saved $50 and found a product that really works well.  The reviews are right and I agree with Reno Guy, this needs to be in black with a skull and cross bones.. GET YOUR FEET BACK AMERICA! Buy this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it.  It gets the job done.  I would recommend this product to anyone all day long.</li>
    <li> It took out most of the calluses I had. Some of the calluses I had were on my toes, but due to the big size of the rasp it was really difficult to remove them. I also had to watch out that I wasn&#x27;t damaging my nails in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that you don&#x27;t overexert the rasp since you can easily get raw skin. From experience, don&#x27;t go exercising the next day if you do over sand your foot.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It works very well and fast. I have to keep remembering to use it before I wet my feet though :) It removes dead skin efficiently and perfectly.</li>
    <li> If you have really callused feet, DO THIS OUTSIDE. I had calluses that were literally like a second set of shoes. 5 minutes with this callus zester and my feet look better then my girlfriends. This tool is amazing. Make sure you don&#x27;t go too deep or your feet will be sore.</li>
    <li> I got tired of messing around with those terrible ped egg pieces of garbage and ordered this. It is pretty big but not unwieldy. This thing will take off the dead skin in a couple stokes so be very careful.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item hoping it would be close to the quality of those used when I go to a salon. While it grosses me out, I strangely LOVE to see all of the dead skin they are able to remove from my feet (and I sort of wonder where it all comes from, LOL). Previously, I have used store-bought versions of these while I am in the shower. This item specified not to use it with wet skin so I hesitantly listened. Something about removing dead skin when it is not wet really freaked me out, so I compromised. I got in the shower and then used this after I got out and had completely dried my skin. This way, my skin was dry as instructed, but it was still softened for my own piece of mind. Anyway, I put down a towel and went to work. It quickly and painlessly removed all of the dead skin just as promised. I did not have to apply a lot of pressure or go over any area a lot like with some others I&#x27;ve used previously (actually I would discourage using a lot of pressure or going over areas too much as I am sure you will have sore feet). Overall, I am very happy with the item and the price was just right!</li>
    <li> Wow. AMAZING!! I can&#x27;t believe that I waited so long to get it. Finally don&#x27;t have to embarrased about my raugh and dry feet.  The picture I attached proves it.</li>
    <li> Absolute best callus remover I&#x27;ve ever used!!!!</li>
    <li> This thing works great.  It&#x27;s really the same as a cheese grater, the rough skin comes off like parmasian cheese.  One tip, it works best for me after soaking my feet in hot water, then grate the cheese while everything is wet.  If you use it with dry feet, results will be different.  Have fun!</li>
    <li> This product worked great with this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PT1R9E?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00</li>
    <li> 100% recommend! This product works great and is professional quality!</li>
    <li> This microplane is EXACTLY what I was looking for!  I&#x27;ve have rough heels my whole life and have tried everything from the ped egg to heel balm.  It took about 60 seconds on each foot to alleviate years of foot problems!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great! It works just like the ones used when getting a pedicure professionally done.</li>
    <li> This product is great. The instructions indicate that you should use it on dry (not wet) feet.  It worked well removing the dead skin from my heels. However, don&#x27;t get too carried away with it, as I did the first time I used it. It functions like a razor and will take off too much skin if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money paying 2 to 8 times more for a powered device.  This is all you need and it is as fast or faster than a powered unit.  I had severely cracked heals from very thick calluses and this worked like a miracle in about 5 minutes for both feet!</li>
    <li> Hard to believe just how well it works for half the price of a nail shop pedicure!  Seriously, I don&#x27;t remember the last time I purchased a product that impressed me so much.  I&#x27;ve read the reviews of folks limping around for a few days after their initial use.  First, this is a file - think cheese grater - you do not want to file away the good skin from you heels.  I tried it dry and with a foot soak/callus remover  - I definitely recommend using it on dry feet.  Be sure to find a good spot to make a mess with all the dry skin that is easy to clean up.  e.g. - you should not do this over a carpet or rug.  I use it on my patio. You are going to be amazed at the amount of skin you file away.  BUT, stop before you get to raw, fresh skin.  Error on the side of caution then come back a day or to later if you still need to remove more.  My heels have never been this smooth even from a high-end spa pedicure.  If you have any doubts about if this will work for you, toss them out the window and order this one.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t realize this is to be used on dry feet, it didn&#x27;t disappoint and worked great. It sloughed off all my dry and calluses spots on my feet.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews. I had a pedicure Monday at the nail salon that left my heels worse then when I walked in there... all flaky, cracked, and rough and peely. After a couple of miserable days and feeling like I wasted $25, I did an Amazon search for cracked heels and this came up among all the creams. I was buying a couple things so I picked one day delivery and got it today (Thursday). I used it right away. I worked on both my heels for roughly 5 minutes total. It was not easy because I couldn&#x27;t see what I was doing while I filed the back of my heals, but there was dust and then I felt my foot and it felt 10 times better. Not flaky at all, not cracked, still mildly rough but WAY better than they were and now they&#x27;re not catching my covers anymore. I was too chicken to keep going so I might work on it a tiny bit more. Very happy three days after a poor pedicure to spend the $9 and take care of my problem heels.</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  You havE to be careful...it will take a few layers of skin off.</li>
    <li> Fun easy game to play, indoors or outdoors but one on the robe rings broke 2 mins after opening the game and playing with it...the glue doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough, or it didn&#x27;t have enough to secure the ring to the wooden bead.</li>
    <li> When I opened it I was a bit worried that it was basically just a thin piece of metal on one side but it seems solid and it works well.</li>
    <li> works very well. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and is wayyyy too easy to overdo it and have a very tender heel the next day.  So be careful/go slow when using.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome, I wish I would have had one for the last 30 years instead of all the other stupid ways I&#x27;ve tried to keep my calluses and cracked heels under control. Believe all the overwhelmingly positive reviews, it really does work.</li>
    <li> I love this tool. It gets all the dead skin off your feet!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing and extremely efficient.  Be careful not to overdo it (as I did at first) or you will have sore feet.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool!  I&#x27;ve been using a sanding block on my feet for years; effective but time consuming and creates a mess.  A friend told me about these and so glad I listened!</li>
    <li> Woo! Finally able to chip away at years of callus buildup. Now, walking is pain-free!</li>
    <li> Best thing I have ever used for my feet. This works so fast and so well you won&#x27;t believe it. So happy with this.</li>
    <li> This seriously looks just like a cheese grater!  Don&#x27;t let that put you off though. It works, it&#x27;s a little gross seeing all that dead skin come off your foot. My feet were left silky smooth, as if I had a pedicure. I&#x27;ve been avoiding pedicures for the past few years, between the cost and lack on environmental concern. My feet have suffered tremendously and calloused feet aren&#x27;t attrative or comfortable. After only 1 use, I felt this was worth every penny. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This rasp does a grate ;) job!</li>
    <li> Very pleased! Works really well and good made in USA quality</li>
    <li> fantastic, gets the job done in seconds. trust those review on here. we will see how long this sucker lasts... my other steel files seem to wear down over time, so we will see...</li>
    <li> This thing really does the trick!!! It&#x27;s really to large though. If you can find a smaller version, I would recommend that.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as ones I&#x27;ve gotten before, but does the basic job</li>
    <li> I love this...its very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Careful not to do too much at once.  It can cut you.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle worker on feet. I run a lot and have calluses built up on my toes. This got rid of them almost instantly.</li>
    <li> I normally get pedicures pretty often, but after I hurt my sciatic nerve, it was hard to get out of the house, much less go get a pedicure.  So, my feet got ragged since I don&#x27;t wear anything other than flip flops and go barefoot around the house.  I had a crack and that skin that&#x27;s dead and pulls on nice smooth surfaces...yeah, gross.  When I did go to get pedicures, extra callous removal is extra, and so I never really wanted to pay extra for the job I really needed.  I remembered when one of the girls used one of these on me.  It seemed to work really well for them.  So, I tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, when I say it is amazingly fast, I&#x27;m not lying.  I had a crack on my right heel from favoring it when I stood and walked.  That crack is barely visible now after only working on it for about 1 minute.  After I was done, which took all of about 3 minutes for both feet, they were pink instead of the dead looking white.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that I don&#x27;t have to soak my feet before using.  I have a 16 month old baby, and there&#x27;s not really time to soak your feet and then use a pumice unless my husband is home.  So, I liked that it was fast and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I did it over the bathroom trash can.  Although, maybe next time I will do it over the tub, or maybe even outside (just to not have to clean up).  The dead skin does tend to fly, so I found places outside of the trash can where it missed.  But I don&#x27;t even care, because my feet look and feel nice again.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love this foot file! It works so well, I couldn&#x27;t believe how well! Heed the warnings, dont over file your feet or you will have sore heels for a week! Trust me, if you have bad calloused feet, this will take care if it!</li>
    <li> Good product. Arrived quickly and removed my dry, calloused skin quickly. It works better than anything I&#x27;ve bought in the store, including callous shavers.  It&#x27;s tricky to use on the contours of the feet because of the size but, it&#x27;s doable.  This rasp has to be used carefully and sparingly though; because, it&#x27;s sharp and works quickly, it&#x27;s easy to overdo it and end up with raw heels.  I used mine until the hardened callouses were gone, then slathered my feet in petroleum jelly, then covered in socks.  The next morning, my feet looked pink and smooth; like a child&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; People are complaining that the rasp doesn&#x27;t leave your feet smooth but, it&#x27;s not really suppose to. It removes the hardened callouses; for smooth feet, you have to use it in conjunction with a moisturizer or emollient (like petroleum jelly) and let it soak in overnight.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t owned one of these before. I always like when they do it for me at the pedicure salon and didn&#x27;t realize that I could do it myself at home in 30 seconds. It makes the bottom of your feet really soft I would highly recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> Callus was gone within minutes. Best purchase yet.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! You get the same results that you would from getting a pedicure!</li>
    <li> It is a very convenient product to have, you can adjust how much you want to remove based on the amount of pressure you apply. Not to mention you don&#x27;t even need to soak your feet or dampen them at all!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this pedicure rasp!  I use it when my feet are completely dry so it only removes the calluses/dead skin.  If your skin is just dry, you can tell the difference by trying to use this and it just doesn&#x27;t have the same effect.  Took very little time to cover both feet too.  Not nearly the effort you need with a pumice stone or similar.</li>
    <li> Best foot rasp out there.  Just be careful because it&#x27;s easy to take too much off.</li>
    <li> Wow. I know I read the reviews and people we&#x27;re raving about this. That&#x27;s partly why I bought it. But man oh man does this thing work wonders on dead skin. I tried it for the first time and the skin flakes were flying everywhere with very little pressure or effort. I moved myself and my feet to do this sitting on the edge of an empty bathrub to capture the &amp;#34;snow&amp;#34; flying around. Truth be told, this was actually pretty fun to do. Immediate results. Feet weren&#x27;t hurt or tender. And viola! Better than most pedicure scrubs for sure.</li>
    <li> Love it! Hardly ever get a spa pedicure and now only go for a polich change.</li>
    <li> I had pretty low expectations because I&#x27;ve tried everything.  But this is one product that actually works and is amazing.</li>
    <li> Best tool ever.  Like many others, my heels crack no matter if I have regular pedicures.  Ordered this and was simply amazed at the results.  Quick, painless and my feet look better than they have in years with very minimal effort.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> great of dry crack feet, would save me money from salon.</li>
    <li> Fast service and actually what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Be careful not to take off too much skin. Got here really fast and was well wrapped. Follow the very detailed instructions on cleaning it or it might damage it!</li>
    <li> No way. This thing is not for me. I could not do it. I didn&#x27;t like the idea of rubbing a dry foot. Stick with a pumice stone it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Just like the pro&#x27;s use. My wife loves this thing and I may have to give it a try next time.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Wish I found this earlier!</li>
    <li> I use this on dry feet and then while I&#x27;m in the shower, I go over my feet with a soft pumice, just to get the skin to be extra smooth. Apply a rich lotion and put on socks after the shower and you&#x27;ll have baby-soft feet :)</li>
    <li> Love it, what a great product for the money.  As directions advise, use on dry skin and back and forth, not side to side.</li>
</ol>
