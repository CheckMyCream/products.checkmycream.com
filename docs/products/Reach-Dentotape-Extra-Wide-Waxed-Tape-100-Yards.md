<li> I have wide spaced teeth from having had braces and this is a fantastic floss for me.  </li>
<li> This is hard to fine and never at this low price!  </li>
<li> It calls itself &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34; (implying a flat ribbon) but is really just &amp;#34;thread&amp;#34; (round).  </li>
<li> Thicker than the usual thin floss does a much better job at cleaning plaque.</li>
<li> If you have wide spaced teeth try this floss</li>
<li> It was what i expected</li>
<li> Not sure if there are two different products or not, and was worried when I ordered it, but it seems to be the DentoTAPE that i wanted.</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> We previously ordered this and would order it again.</li>
<li> WHY are you making this more difficult and useless than it should be?</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know what happened to it but have been using it ever since my dentist recommended it 8 years ago - and wasn&#x27;t about to go back to useless floss.  </li>
<li> As usual you got it here on time and in one piece</li>
<li> I always order it from Amazon because it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit thick.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong ordering this product.</li>

    <li> Well - thank heaven for Amazon.  After searching for MONTHS for REACH DentoTAPE in my local area - I finally gave up and came to Amazon.  Don&#x27;t know what happened to it but have been using it ever since my dentist recommended it 8 years ago - and wasn&#x27;t about to go back to useless floss.  SO - thank you Amazon for riding in and saving my teeth/gums!  As usual you got it here on time and in one piece</li>
