<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This more than met my expectations - if you are not sure of what Bay Rum aftershave is, I suggest taking a visit to one of the large outlet or big name stores at your local mall and test the various brands and variations of Bay Rum.  The main element is from the Bay tree, some say it has a &amp;#34;clove&amp;#34; smell - it does but yet there is just &#x27;something&#x27; flirting about with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the day, there was a breath freshener called Sin-Sin, you can google it if you care to but this reminds me a bit of that.  I use a Bay Rum scented shave soap, it is a bit milder, I will say undertone, not quite flowery, this compliments that perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the bottle it is as other noted - strong.  Not overpowering but you will know it is there, it fades back just a bit and remains present throughout the day.  If you live or work in a cubicle farm, you will not overpower your co-workers, they will know you have it on.  Perhaps moisten your hand and apply just a few drops (bottle comes with a drip spout for easy control - bottle is also plastic), then apply to your face.  Somewhere along the line you will find the right mix for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy on the musk / smoky side of a Bay Rum, hint of orange blossom peeks out over the Bay Tree scent which is the main element.  It may not be for all but it is unique, it is a Superior Bay Rum blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a constant item on my shelf and used regularly.  (why four stars, not five?  Five star rating are used way more often than they should be in my humble opinion, if it makes you feel better I was or could rate it a five star).</li>
    <li> This lively scent will perk you up and give you kind of a cinnamon lift.</li>
    <li> I like it, the wife hates it, but some of the older gals at my job think I smell dreamy like a young Burt Reynolds. Does have an odd note of some kind of chemical, but that dissipates after a little while from when you put it on.</li>
    <li> Reminds of days long ago. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Strong classic scent. Smells like bay rum. Lasts long. I was smelling this on my face many hours after my shave, its gone now but the feeling on my skin still lingers. Do not be a wuss, this will sting a tiny bit, just enough to let you know your alive.</li>
    <li> A delightfully economical take on the classic Bay Rum aftershave that smells better than it costs. Not overwhelming at all, just a rapidly fading bouquet of scents, clove being predominant among them, that is pretty much gone after 3-4 hours. High alcohol content will punish inattentive shavers, but is merely warming otherwise. It is drying as initially presented, out of the bottle. I counteracted the drying effect by adding a generous amount of glycerin--like 30 or 40 drops, which turns this pungent mixture into a very nice face tonic that I keep reaching for, despite the array of more expensive aftershaves sitting beside it on the shelf.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there are vast numbers of men out there who just love this aroma and as many women, as well. It just didn&#x27;t do it for me and my better half didn&#x27;t necessarily enjoy it like she does the original scent.</li>
    <li> Clubmans best smell ever.</li>
    <li> Love how my husband smells with this on! Similar scent to Old Spice but with a touch of clove scent to it. Would recommend. Husband says it has slight burn to it when first put on from all the alcohol in it, but it goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> This crap is strong!!!!  Typical of the after shaves of the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.  Once the alcohol burn and odor simmer down. . . it does leave a pleasent smell.  Give it a little while to air out.  Avoid the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas.  Do not use much.  Just enough to moisten your palm.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent to start the day!</li>
    <li> I recently started shaving with a safety razor and needed an aftershave.  I was drawn to the low cost (but also slightly apprehensive) and the 6 Oz size.  Could something be this inexpensive and still deliver?  The answer is a great big yes.  It is a big value, but a bigger thrill to put on.  I have not used many aftershaves, and I may not have to look any further than this.  It has a terrific scent and I look forward to putting it on every morning.  In fact, come this Christmas, our fruitcake may be as refreshing as an island sea breeze...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a good Bay Rum and this one will do, but it is still lacking that special little something that I can&#x27;t put into words.  The fragrance just doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long and it wears off quickly.  This is not a bad product by any means and it may suit some quite nicely, but for me I like something with a little more umph.</li>
    <li> Not a real, true bay rum. It&#x27;s a little on the cinnamon side, but none the less, it&#x27;s good stuff. Spicy and leaves you smelling like nothing most women have ever smelled.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells SO damn good. A sweet blend of cinnamon, bay leaves, and yes, a little rum. I use it on my face, body, and even my clothes before a night on the town, and I get compliments left and right. Try it with Colonel Conk&#x27;s Bay Rum Shaving Soap and you&#x27;ve got yourself a date. I also highly suggest trying the other Clubman Pinaud aftershaves, each of them has an old-fashion barber shop scent that is certainly void into today&#x27;s men&#x27;s market.     Word of the wise, this IS an alcohol-based aftershave, so some burning of the skin after you shave is expected. I use a little unscented lotion first to remedy that. All in all, a great smell at a great price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it a first because of the strong cloves scent, but it dries down nicely and the scent kinda grows on you. There are more complex (and more expensive) Bay Rums out there but it&#x27;s hard to beat this one at its price point. I recommend trying it once *for at least a week* to see what you think, if you don&#x27;t like it send it to me!</li>
    <li> Very different type of aftershave.  Somewhat similar to Old Spice, but a little sweeter and spicier smelling.  The more I use it, the more I like it.  The great thing about it is the burn.  A minute or so after applying it, my face and neck turn a little red and I get this invigorating burn.  It then reduces to a nice warm feeling.  I find that the aroma after it&#x27;s been on a while is even better than the initial application.  This one is a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> Used Bay Rum years ago and when I found this product, I ordered it to see if it was the same.  It is and this was my third order.</li>
    <li> Took me a while to get used to this. I like it in the tropics or summer time, and it has a real Christmas spice vibe to it too. Kind of burny too, not in a good way.</li>
    <li> this is the original barbershop smell I remember as a young man, I love clubman products this is just the best</li>
    <li> I like the scent but it only lasts about an hour.... I think there are better products out there. For the price it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> Nice old fashion aftershave splash that doesn&#x27;t knock you over.  Strong, but not heavy Rum aroma.</li>
    <li> I like the trend in reviving men&#x27;s shaving as art beyond a necessity. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been buying up various &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; aftershaves with the hope of recapturing some of those days gone by. This stuff is classic Pinaud. Pungent and distinct in every way. It smells like bay rum at it core, but the immediate hit is a woody spiciness like clove or cinnamon with oak. Use sparingly if you plan on cologne too as it will stand on its own if you&#x27;re liberal with the juice. It&#x27;s a great fall/winter scent.</li>
    <li> Sweeter smell than I thought</li>
    <li> 100% synthetic chemicals, even the color, shame on these companies not even trying to make something decent</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff and it makes my face feel good after a shave.  I have never heard a comment from anyone else though, one way or the other.  LOL</li>
    <li> Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum is great! I put some on my hair when I shampoo every day &amp; every day in the morning after shaving. It is a nice after shave &amp; cologne. For the price, as far as I am concerned, it is a nice product. I will be ordering more very shortly. The scent is sort of like cloves &amp; cinnamon. It is like the old stuff that the barber would spray on your hair when he was cutting it. When you first put it on, it is a little strong. However, after about 10 minutes, the scent is not as strong &amp; is very pleasing.</li>
    <li> We all know this one from corner barbershop days.  Somewhat strong, inexpensive, in an unbreakable bottle that easily seals. A bargain.</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to like this more, but to me, it was like sticking my nose in a jar of cloves! Where&#x27;s the BAY? Where&#x27;s the RUM? I have a GREAT sense of smell and just could not get around the cloves. Maybe someone fell asleep at the clove machine that day, I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t hate cloves, I just don&#x27;t want to smell like I&#x27;m made of them. The Original Clubman Pinaud, That stuff is awesome, I&#x27;ll review it soon. Special Reserve, Love it too!   Update: O.K. It grew on me, as Ive used it more and noticed how it smells later in the day I like it! so FOURS stars for YOU Virgin Bay Rum!</li>
    <li> A classic scent - but be warned, it burns, just as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your kids will scream like Kevin (MaCaulay Culkin) left Home Alone if they splash this on thier cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great aftershave.</li>
    <li> This item is refreshing to your face after shaving. It has the smell of the old barber shops I remember from so long ago. I am glad to see that these bay rum after shaves are still available.</li>
    <li> I have found my new aftershave. This stuff smells great and feels good on my shave after I shave. Classic scent, not too overpowering if you splash on with a little water. I&#x27;ll keep this one in stock.</li>
    <li> If you like bay rum this is a great value. The aroma is great and as with all the Clubman products the price is really inexpensive. If you&#x27;re tired of the sweet smelling stuff that the mall department stores carry, try this.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, came as expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent after shave @ a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> This stuff smell awesome.  Tightens up your skin really well.</li>
    <li> I really like this bay rum. It smells the way all barbershops used to smell years ago. And, it&#x27;s bracing right after a shave: you slap some on and it slaps you right back.</li>
    <li> spicy of course, but not nearly as stout as some. a classic &amp;#34; old time &amp;#34; fragrance.</li>
    <li> Clubman Pinaud Bay Rum is a simple, old fashioned after shave.  It comes in a simple, platic bottle which won&#x27;t shatter on your bathroom floor, and it smells just like bay rum ought to smell.</li>
    <li> Look, I am a fan of the regular and vanilla clubmans but the Bay Rum is terrible and actually triggered a migrane head ache for my spouse. It smells of overpowering cheap cloves and is just flat out awful. Splurge and get Captain&#x27;s Choice instead  - it costs more yes but a little bit goes a long way and it is the real deal.</li>
    <li> This is now one of my all time favorite scents.  Not overpowering, but very nice and clean smell.  Hints of cinnamon, allspice and citrus are all noted.  There is not a lot of sting when using as an aftershave.  Doesn&#x27;t last very long, but is definitely worth trying out.</li>
    <li> Title says it all.   I highly recommend Ogallala Bay Rum products.  Put down the Pinaud and try Ogallala.  Ogallala contains natural essential oils, not chemicals.    I also recommend the \\&quot;Special Reserve Double Strength Cologne\\&quot;.  It is my favorite from what Ogallala offers and definitely the best Bay Rum I&#x27;ve ever tried, although the original will suit most people fine.</li>
    <li> There are many bay rum&#x27;s out there and this one is not my favorite. When I use it, I make sure to follow up with a balm to keep my skin moisturized. If you want a really great Bay Rum, I strongly suggest Captain&#x27;s Choice.</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff!  Feels great after a multi pass wet shave.  Gives you that mild burn followed by a nice clean refreshing feeling.  The scent is a bit spicy, but not overpowering.  I get wafts of it throughout the day.  Makes you feel a bit like a pirate, I like it</li>
    <li> I had read the positive reviews on this product and decided to try it.  Unfortunately, I immediately noticed that the smell whispered \\&quot;chemicals\\&quot; more than \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;.  And it seemed rather weak and not very long lasting.  I&#x27;ve tried several Bay Rum&#x27;s.  Some I liked.  Some I didn&#x27;t.  ALL seemed to disappear too quickly. Is there ANY Bay Rum out there that truly has both the elegant quality and the lasting power of finer men&#x27;s colognes? My search continues...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent.  I plan on buying more, and making this my regular after-shave.</li>
    <li> It is a different kind of Bay Rum than I am used to. My favorite Bay Rum is Ogallala. This is very different from that scent. This Bay Rum also smells great and gives you that wonderful burn that we all love so much. Makes my skin feel awesome after as well. Hydrates and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and smooth. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I had been looking all over for this because I have heard good things.  I was excited to get some but, was slightly let down.    The odor smells like Christmas, which can be good. The scent is not real strong and does not seem to last long.  It does feel quite refreshing on my face.  It is sweet smelling, you can catch the spices immediately in the aroma. It took some getting used to but, it is a nice smell.    I would say that this is a decent product but, the scent was not as great as I was expecting.  I am happy to continue wearing it but, it will not be an everyday product for me.  I do recommend it but, recognize that it may not be for all occasions. If your woman digs it, though, it is for you!</li>
    <li> This Clubman scent is very strong (like the rest of them) and smells great. You can&#x27;t beat it for what it costs.</li>
    <li> Classic and east central... You cannot go</li>
    <li> A bit too strong no matter how little one tries to use...</li>
    <li> I expected this product to burn more than it did.  Thankfully, it is nice and soothing on freshly shaved skin, plus it makes me smell like the old barber shop I used to go to.  Good stuff and worth the purchase if you&#x27;re getting other classic shaving implements.</li>
    <li> Good aftershave, smells like cloves. Since the wife approves, I&#x27;m good.</li>
    <li> Wonderful low-keyed aroma that women love, or so they claim. (Good enough for this lad). I understand, also, that it can double as an effective mosquito repellent at the same time...SO you attract the sweeties while chasing away the meanies. GOOD STUFF, INDEED!</li>
    <li> much cheaper than fancy cologne. Smells a lot like cloves and other spices. Wife says I smell good and you can&#x27;t go wrong with that. Definitely not a lotion, more a pure aftershave. I still use my nivia lotion after a shave for moisture.</li>
    <li> This smells like a Christmas ham with all the clove smells. Nice holiday smell or summertime smell. Reminds me of Christmas or Thanksgiving.</li>
    <li> I tried this on a whim, only having tried a scant few bay-rum-scented items before. My basic experience with it has been that this aftershave is pure cinnamon-and-clove-scented alcohol. If you go open up a spice cabinet, sprinkle some cinnamon ground cloves in a jar and smell it, you&#x27;ll get the same olfactory experience. The scent is very long-lasting, and a small amount will go a long way. If you are looking for this scent, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product. However, if you&#x27;re looking for something a little more subtle, I would look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Smells nasty-I guess it is an acquired taste</li>
    <li> Barton Creek Golf Club in Austin, Texas had placed bottles of Pinaud Special Reserve in the Club Dressing Room.  After a hot and humid day of golf, I went into the dressing room to wash up for supper and used the Special Reserve for the first time.  I liked it so much that I ordered the Special Reserve, The Musk and the Bay Rum from Amazon and like them all.  The aroma is pleasant, not over powering.  I alternate the use of the three and will use nothing else.</li>
    <li> Initially, a very intense aroma.  It has a strong  &#x27;food-like&#x27; smell of cloves and bay leaf but fortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last long.  I suppose all of this is subjective but it&#x27;s not what I was expecting and not what I remember about the bay rum my father used many years ago. I plan to  give this to my barber and keep looking.</li>
    <li> This Bay Rum is almost scentless.  I can&#x27;t believe the reviews that say it is too strong.  Tried it twice, then put something else on top of it.</li>
    <li> Best smelling Bay Rum the scent just doesn&#x27;t stay long.</li>
    <li> I have used the \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; Clubman scent in the past and I enjoy Bay Rum aftershaves so I thought I would give this a try. I was pleasantly surprised. The Bay Rum scent is strong out of the bottle, a little too much alcohol for my preference but you can hold the liquid in your hands for a minute to let the alcohol burn off. The scent is decently strong but not overpowering and lasts into the afternoon (I have an oily face, as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat, my face was ON FIRE for a full 5 minutes after applying! It was refreshing, but be warned!</li>
    <li> Great aftershave and fantastic smell. Works perfect for me because the smell goes away after 10 or 15 minutes, so I get to enjoy it when I first put it on but have no harsh cologne smell during the day. You can also use your own cologne after using this and the Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum does not interfere. This is now my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; aftershave!</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter took a whiff of this and told me to not use it. As a result, I have not!</li>
    <li> This is just like I used to get when I got my haircut as a kid and it smells the same. VERY lite scent but lasts all day. This is what it&#x27;s suppose to be. You don&#x27;t want to announce your arrival from around the corner before people see you. They have to get close to smell it and it&#x27;s a soft scent and everyone loves it. I don&#x27;t like the plastic bottle but for the price and results I&#x27;ll bypass the glass bottle brands for now.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> This was an impulse buy, to sample an inexpensive but acclaimed after shave. Though it is more complex, it smells like one part bay, one part rum, and 1/4 part rum. It mellows out nicely in a few minutes to a bay and sandlewood fragrance. You and those close around you will still notice but not be punched in the olfactory by it til you wash again. This must be where old spice took its cueue, but added more and longer lasting clove and sweet fragrance. I would say it is much, much better than OS and wouldn&#x27;t be mistaken for it. It is a great change-up, especially for an evening at the club, a sporting event, golf, etc. It is an affluent scent that need not be abandoned while beta males try one obnoxious and caustic axe (appropriate brand name) scent after the other trying to be noticed. I will buy this or Pinaud&#x27;s bay rum again and again.</li>
    <li> The classic scent of Bay Rum, manly and simple</li>
    <li> ...evokes fond memories of being a young boy sitting cross-legged on the bathroom counter and intently watching my grandfather&#x27;s every move as he methodically went through the machinations of his daily early morning wet-shave ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time when he was done carefully shaving and then cleaning the straight razor, along with the lathering cup and brush, he would look at himself in the mirror while stroking his cheeks to check for any missed spots while reaching for the clear glass bottle of Ed Pinaud&#x27;s CLUBMAN VIRGIN ISLAND BAY RUM Aftershave Splash and proceed to douse his face, neck and chest with a couple of healthy handfuls of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his hands still dripping of this beautifully spicy and exotic, bay tree filled far-away-tropical-paradise smelling after shave, he would then rub my cheeks, the top of my ears and head with the excess and I would smell just like grandpa&#x27;s aftershave all day long...and I absolutely loved it. I reveled in it then and deeply cherish the memory today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So imagine my shear delight when I recently came across this classic product...I purchased the larger 12oz size bottle, which looks almost exactly like the bottle from almost 50 years ago except it&#x27;s now a shatter-proof plastic instead of the thicker glass bottle it used to be packaged in. Ok, I can live with that, being more safety-conscious in today&#x27;s world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real test was what was inside that bottle...did it look the same with that light brown yet rich looking brown color?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES...the color and overall look is exactly the same as I remember it from almost 50 years ago. So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it feel the same with its silky smooth texture along with its unique soothing, cooling and refreshing tingle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALMOST...it seems to be lighter-bodied now with hardly any cooling sensation, though it is still quite soothing and refreshing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And most importantly, did it smell the same with it&#x27;s heady exotically spicy base along with its subtle yet very punchy combination essences of bay trees, clove and a hint of cinnamon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, NO...it did NOT. It is now a shadow of its former self sidelined by a complete lack of balanced pungency...its now WAY too clove-heavy with very little essence of bay tree and virtually zero cinnamon oil emanating from today&#x27;s formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable and wearable \\&quot;old school\\&quot; type of scent that&#x27;s perfect for running weekend errands or a casual mid-afternoon lunch with a lover, but do NOT expect to get the same product formulation as 50 years ago...it&#x27;s now a MUCH different, almost unrecognizable after shave to that of the original.tically spicy base along with its subtle yet very punchy combination essences of bay trees, clove and a hint of cinnamon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, NO...it did NOT. It is now a shadow of its former self sidelined by a complete lack of balanced pungency...its now WAY too clove-heavy with very little essence of bay tree and virtually zero cinnamon oil emanating from today&#x27;s formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable and wearable \\&quot;old school\\&quot; type of scent that&#x27;s perfect for running weekend errands or a casual mid-afternoon lunch with a lover, but do NOT expect to get the same product formulation as 50 years ago...it&#x27;s now a MUCH different, almost unrecognizable after shave to that of the original.</li>
    <li> I found this after searching different sites about shaving, at work everyone really like it.  My wife loves it also. It reminds me of those days when my dad took us to those saturday haircuts.  This scent is not overpowering, lasts well into the evening. I really recommend it to anybody who remembers those haircuts or want to teach your son about shaving.</li>
    <li> Spicy, manly, what more can I say about it? Notes of Bay and Cinnamon, and a few others I&#x27;m trying to place. Definitely not High School locker room stuff.</li>
    <li> I hope they never quit making this Pinaud line for men.</li>
    <li> This is the bay run I have been using for years and it stands alone on its quality and reputation. The five star rating is because Ely Drugs delivered this to my door exceptionally fast ad in great condition. I will shop with them again.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the money! I guess, I have nothing to compare it to but it&#x27;s a pretty good cologne. I gave up buying expensive colognes that just evaporate by the time you go out the front door, a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Smelled very strange.  Chemically.  I have learned to pay close attention to the negative reviews, rather than just dismiss them if greatly outweighed.  A negative might be because it spilled, or was too pricey, or just &amp;#34;not my cup of tea.&amp;#34;  This, on the other hand, was simply not wearable.  I threw it out.  From now on I will pay a bit and get natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> It really does smell like spiced rum! Was not expecting that.  It&#x27;s a nice scent, but I worry about my coworkers thinking I have a bottle problem.</li>
    <li> Scent is mostly clove followed by cinnamon.  The cinnamon oil burns just shaved skin.  Fine as a fragrance though.  For aftershave, I&#x27;d recommend the Clubman original or vanilla.</li>
    <li> Very good fragrance and nice feeling after shave.  I will continue to use this as it is working very well and has a great masculine natural fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to be wowed by this after reading reviews.  Scent is nothing special, just some spicy potpourri that I don&#x27;t recall ever smelling before...on anyone or in any barber shop.  It&#x27;s okay, but I would not have bought it had I smelled it previous.</li>
    <li> This this aftershave, and the Virgin Island Bay Rum soap as well, have just too strong of an essence of cinnamon.</li>
    <li> One of the best inventions ever. I can never ever find this kind in any store around my area. The bay rum scent is amazing. I need not say more. It burns when it goes on and soothes after your shave. It helps prevent razor bumps and gives you a great smell afterward. It goes a long time. I have had it for quite some time and I have hardly used a 1/4 of it. Definite must buy. Clubman makes a great product. Would most definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Previously Submitted.</li>
    <li> Not over powering scent and very refreshing. Used daily as a bracing aftershave and body splash. Cant do that with most aftershaves due to the strong scent in most</li>
    <li> I grew up with &amp;#34;Bay Rum&amp;#34; as a manly scent.  Kind of like Old Spice - but less flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are over 17, please skip the &amp;#34;AXE&amp;#34; and the imitators.  Nobody likes to be slapped with a cosmic cloud of reek when you walk by.  (And no, the girls are not magnetically attracted to an AXE cloud...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased a few different types/flavors of Bay Rum scents over the years, never finding &amp;#34;the right&amp;#34; scent.  Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect rendition of what I remember.  Slightly spicy/complex - but not flowery or overpowering.  Downright zingy after a close shave in the morning.  (And I don&#x27;t leave a smelly &amp;#34;backwash trail&amp;#34; as I walk through the cubes at work...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to the folks that figured this out.  Classy, strong, manly (not flowery) scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JDMc</li>
    <li> Reeks of clove oil and all spice. Nothing like the true thing. I would save the money and try one iPod the many other options on amazon</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s useable, but not what I was expecting. That&#x27;s probably just me though, it is not what I remember my barber using when I was young.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t evaporate quickly. It doesn&#x27;t last all day, however, I&#x27;ve used other bay Rum&#x27;s that literally stopped smelling before I left the bath. Aside from the plastic bottle, which basically just feels cheap, I love this after shave.</li>
    <li> One of my new favorite scents</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has a nice cooling sensation (more than Proraso) and a strong scent of cloves. My wife, however, isn&#x27;t crazy about the initial spicy aroma, but the scent dissipates after a while and then she&#x27;s fine with it. Overall, it&#x27;s a good, old world, masculine way to start the day.</li>
    <li> A true classic. Must try at least once.</li>
    <li> A nice spicy scent to mix it up, but pinaud is better.  Ill keep it i n rotation and see if I like it more.  Update, wife has asked me NOT to wear this again.  She said it makes me smell like the spice cabinet.  I&#x27;m out less than $10, so how could you go wrong.  She still loves the Pinaud.</li>
    <li> I have never been one for aftershave, but this was quite a refreshing experience.  When I&#x27;ve used aftershaves in the past, they always would irritate my skin for a good while.  This bay rum aftershave is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.  It really makes your face feel soft and vibrant.  The smell is strong and manly, which is why I chose it.  I didn&#x27;t want to smell like French cologne, and this has an excellent and long-lasting odor.  I would highly recommend this to those who want to smell like a million bucks.  A little bay rum does a body good.</li>
    <li> Has a definite clove note.  Very warm spicy scent.  I really like the clubman products I have tried and want to try more in the future such as Lime Sec and Eu De Portugal.</li>
    <li> Great scent. I enjoy the clubman and this Is a nice change of pace. Has a few more ingredients then the standard bay rum,, but well worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I love the original clubman and its old time barbershop smell.  This Virgin Island Bay Rum is much different.  It is way too heavy on the cinnamon and cloves.  To me, it smells just like christmas potpourri.  This does not have that old time smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel on my face is good.  It has a nice clubman sting when you first put it on and leaves your face smooth and refreshed. My wife likes the scent so I will use it when I&#x27;m hanging around the house, but that&#x27;s about it.  Three stars because it does work, it&#x27;s just the scent that I don&#x27;t really like at all.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve not had any other experiences with Bay Rum so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Immediately upon opening the bottle, very strong clove smell with just a hint of some spice under there. Tried it on, clove smell lingered for me about half an hour but then fades away to leave something great, spicy, cinnamon smell with something woody under there. After a couple of hours it really fades to nothing much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used as an aftershave, it&#x27;s not one of those cooling and soothing products, you know it&#x27;s on and you know it&#x27;s working hard, you just deal with the burn and feel good! I&#x27;d recommend it again, I just wish the cloves weren&#x27;t quite so strong and the underlying smell lasted a little longer because that&#x27;s a good one. Very retro barbershop cool smell!</li>
    <li> Wonderful barber shop scent.  Only wished it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> A very old school smell with modern comforts added for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More clove than bay rum smell.  Little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels refreshed and smooth afterwards.</li>
    <li> It smells great, and the smell slowly diminishes over time, which I like.  Burns a little going on after a fresh shave but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> Not horrible. But not very good either. Bottle was leaking.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and soothing but the scent is definitely for cooler weather. Good stuff but maybe save it for the fall/winter.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, Has a very clove spice scent.</li>
    <li> This is a classic barbershop scent!  There are other brands, but clubman sets the bar very high.  None of the rest com close...this is the real deal</li>
    <li> Good quality, but the scent is not one I would wear every day.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d really found the aftershave I&#x27;d be using for the rest of my life when I started using the classic Pinaud aftershave lotion, but I think I might like this one even better. It smells wonderful, and since I started using it, my girlfriend&#x27;s nose is pretty much attached to my face in the morning after I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has some serious heat to it (a lot more than the classic one does), but the sting doesn&#x27;t last very long. It&#x27;ll definitely wake you up in the morning, and leaves your face feeling great and almost a little numb.</li>
    <li> Bay Rum has been around for ever and Clubman is my favorite brand.. After shaving and a quick rinse with cold water, splash this on and you will feel like a million bucks. When ever I use other shave products, I rarely get asked what it is, but when I use bay rum&lt;br /&gt;many times people will inquire as to what it is. Whenever I go to my favorite Cigar Bar some young lass will inevitably ask what it is.</li>
    <li> Great scent that compliments any Bay Rum shave soap</li>
    <li> This men&#x27;s after shave smells so yummy!  It is a fresh spicy scent that reminds me of being in a vintage bakery!</li>
    <li> Too small and not worth the shipping. Why not sell a gallon size for those that use it twice a day?</li>
    <li> I love the smell and conditioning this gives my hair  too. I use only on special occasions or when I need to smell good and have some control on my medium length hair. Drives men and woman crazy, they love it. I&#x27;m not joking. They all get real close to me and ask me about that delicious smelling scent.</li>
    <li> This was my first &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34; purchase. I was very pleased. It has a pleasant smell. It reminded me of the days when men were men and not metrosexuals. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Rum and clove aroma; considerably stronger &#x27;sting&#x27; than Ogallala Bay Rum (which I prefer -- closes skin pores fast - others might not). This is a nice size; stores in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering. This has become my go-to aftershave with a close second going to the original Pinaud Clubman.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dark rum fan.  You know...dark &amp; stormys.  So I guess my drinking self(Captain Jack Sparrow) said...that this would be a great after shave.  Problem is...it is has too much of a sweet cinnamon scent.  Which my girlfried said is great if you are at a Xmas holiday party.  Funny thing is if they added a little more alcohol to this it would be perfect.........like how &amp;#34;dark rum&amp;#34; SHOULD smell like.  Skip this...go for the original classic Clubman scent or 3 roses for that real barbershop experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not good with adjectives on how to describe it, the best I could come up with is that this is a woodsy/earthy scent.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have taken an unscientific survey among my female friends.&lt;br /&gt;Out of five women between the ages of 23-29,&lt;br /&gt;- 2 said it smelled really good&lt;br /&gt;- 2 said it was ok or had no opinion&lt;br /&gt;- 1 said I&#x27;m not going to sniff your neck you freak&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All 5 agreed that it would be better than wearing nothing at all. There you have it</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. Great price.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Unusually pleasant scent. Stings like blazes and tells you where you shaved too close.  Punishes you when you create a razor burn. You&#x27;ll know better next time. A shaving lesson in a bottle and it smells good too. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I was really expecting an old time scent and something strong.. though the fragrance is strong initially and is very &amp;#34;Clovey&amp;#34; I find that it fades away very fast. It could be because of the tropical climate of the place where I live.  Bought this and the Pinaud Special reserve solely based on the number of positive reviews that both of them have received on this site but am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first bayrum that I have used and so don&#x27;t really have a benchmark to compare it with.</li>
    <li> Dedicated to my Professor Dr. StrangeBrew.  We started with the Bay Rum and now I have just about all the Clubman Colognes and Aftershaves. What  a wonderful collection of the finest men products for such a great cost offered by AMAZON and Clubman. Just like my Uncle&#x27;s Barber shop in Little Italy, Wilmington, Delaware. On the corner of 5th and Lincoln St. Jimmy the Barber!!!. You came out of his shop with the wonderful fragrance of a Clubman product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care about these reviews with the ones and twos. They have not really given the AMAZON Clubman selection a chance or the would be writing comments about the great product they are.Any way we been out of touch and you know I have used Clubman on every assignment all over the world. The FOUR Corners. Well my Agent Orange Cancer is back for the second time. Now at 74 that is a worry but not all is lost. Every day I get radiated in this heck of a machine that is bigger than some of the helicopters I flew. Not all is lost. Before and after I get the biggest hug from every nurse and administrator. That&#x27;s Italian!! They LOVE CLUBMAN. End of story Dr. Strangbrew. We got a good product. For those who want to try Clubman ;AMAZON has great prices. Give it a shot. If you don&#x27;t like it sent it to me. The government is going  to take away Military Pensions to study their shoes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Anthony P. DiBenedetto Sr</li>
    <li> Want to smell like a man ought to smell?  Slap on some Bay Rum and rest easy knowing that you smell great.  This stuff is classic and won&#x27;t bother women (or people in general) who are sensitive to modern body sprays and such.  It&#x27;s classic and great to use as a cologne, an aftershave (feel the burn!), or both.  Also, it makes your chest hair feel amazing and shine like you&#x27;ve freshly returned from an island beach.</li>
    <li> Not as spicy as I would like but you definitely know when you put it on, you don&#x27;t want to but you do.  You know you are alive, it is a jolt.</li>
    <li> Way over the top., March 9, 2010  By  M. Haney - See all my reviews           I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that some guys obviously love this stuff, but here&#x27;s my perspective:     I don&#x27;t wear cologne, and as far as \\&quot;smelling like a man\\&quot; goes I believe there are two general routes. Light-medium and spicy/stimulating, or extremely strong but more subtle/muted. This stuff is extremely strong and spicy/stimulating; and I mean strong. When I first cracked the cap open on this thing I got a huge whiff of it within a second, and that was from a 1 ft away before I&#x27;d even removed the cap. I later experimented by spreading a small drop over one of my fingers and seeing how long it lasted. Well it lasted forever and didn&#x27;t die much. Could smell that tiny drop from 1 ft away easy. Now granted I apparently have a more sensitive nose then most, but this stuff smells stronger than most detergents. Can&#x27;t imagine how strong it would be if I splashed this stuff all over my face (or body as the instructions suggest). Would probably give me a headache.     As for the scent itself, my first thought was \\&quot;old person\\&quot;, my second thought was \\&quot;overcompensating\\&quot;. \\&quot;Overcompensating old person\\&quot; is not the image I want to project.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but not what I was expecting, If you use it and really like a spicy smell it&#x27;s good I would have perfered a different smell</li>
    <li> Bay Rum is a classic scent used in many products for close to a century.  The Clubman Bay Rum smells great, with cloves and other tropical spices.  However, if you or your significant other do not like the smell of cloves, then I suggest you pass on this one.  The scent will stick around quite a while, and it feels good on normal skin.  It has a decent burn if you use it after shaving, and lacks astringent or cooling ingredients like Clubman aftershave, so keep that it mind.  The price certainly can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed by the smell. It was overpowering. 1 drop felt like too much.</li>
    <li> I like Clubman and this Bay Rum is actually one of the very few Bay Rum scents that I actually like.</li>
    <li> Some people like old spice and the other assortment of fragrances out there, but, this is a great smell.  The product isn&#x27;t made the same way as traditional bay rum aftershave (soaking  Pimenta racemosa bay leaves in rum and vodka, along with some spices and citrus -- worth making at least once!).  It isn&#x27;t too musky, not too sweet, it has a very organic smell to it.  It&#x27;s sometimes sweet, sometimes not.  It is a very unique smell and it&#x27;s not a common smell to have, so I&#x27;ve gotten the &amp;#34;Hm, what&#x27;s that smell? It smells good.  What brand is it?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Smells OK, but not great. There&#x27;s way too much cinnamon in the mix that completely overpowers the rest of the fragrance, it just smells like I&#x27;m putting on cinnamon oil. The bottle is cheap plastic, I expected glass from the picture and the cost. Despite the name, there&#x27;s no rum in it. The sweet smell comes from benzene which is carcinogenic. Disappointed after ordering it I found the same brand and bottle at my local chain drug store for less than half of what I paid. I probably won&#x27;t reorder this type.</li>
    <li> I like it.  As with most good aftershaves, I wish the smell could last longer.  Good burn, not over the top.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  Don&#x27;t judge it when you first put it on; it turns into a great barber shop smell!</li>
    <li> I put some on and climbed into my girlfriend&#x27;s bed and she remarked &amp;#34;You smell like a pirate, come here.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy some.</li>
    <li> When I took a whiff strait from the bottle I didn&#x27;t think I would like it because the dominant scent was cinnamon, but like another Clubman aftershave I have Clubman / Pinaud it has layered scents. My experience with the Bay Rum aftershave was...strong Cinnamon at first applied, but then that layer dissipated and I found a gentile sweet very pleasant Bay, citrus, and cloves.  Clove scent dissipated after a while and the Bay Rum citrus scent stayed with me very subtle into the mid afternoon.  This one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I prefer this to the Clubman Special Reserve, but will still stick with regular Clubman.  I do like the spiciness of this aftershave, but it smells a bit Christmas-y.</li>
    <li> Was so excited to receive this in the mail.  Shipped fast and was securely delivered.&lt;br /&gt;The product is amazing, especially for the price.  First sting is refreshing and delivers a warm true bay rum scent--cloves, cinnamon, and a hint of sweet alcohol.  After about five minutes it dries down to a perfect seasonal scent.  The girlfriend likes it, so no complaints there.  She prefers the bay rum to the classic clubman aftershave.  Both products are great for me as I have sensitive skin and no Clubman product has ever made me break out.  The Lady says I smell like Christmas!  If you are looking for a fall-winter aftershave, and don&#x27;t want to drop a lot of cash, this is it!</li>
    <li> This is great. The scent is great, but different than I was expecting. I am only 28, so I cannot compare it to the old &amp;#34;barber shop&amp;#34; smell that others refer to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a clove overtone, and it burns like hell when you put it on. Part of it is the alcohol, which is more of a sting, but it also has a warm/hot feeling that I think comes from the spices. This made my face feel &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; afterwards, and it sort of reminds you that you just shaved. Scent remains for about half the day. it is still there in the evening, but I stop smelling it about half way through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife does like it, but says this is kind of an old man smell, but then again she has said that about all my aftershaves (Pinaud Clubman, and Aqua Velva).</li>
    <li> An excellent after-shave!</li>
    <li> Another great Pinaud product.  This one has a good burn as an after shave but also soothes well.  The scent is either sweet spicy or spicy sweet, depending on the day&#x27;s weather.  It&#x27;s not powdery like some of the other Clubman scents.  I find it to have more of a penetrating clean presence with a sugary rum background.</li>
    <li> Good, almost top quality like the original.</li>
    <li> This is a good aftershave for a man.  Smells like the good old fashioned spicey type manly smell from the corner barbershop.  Great value for product.  Good refreshing feel after a shave.  Scent is there but not over powering and not like the AXE type smells that can hit you like a tazer gun.  I don&#x27;t like colones and prefer the more subtle aftershaves.  If I wish to refresh a bit at lunch or before going out in the evening, this will do the trick.</li>
    <li> Smells like sweet Thanksgiving.  Clovey and Cinnamony.  To me, it smells good.  To my wife, it smells like cloves.  She doesn&#x27;t care for it.  BUT, the smell dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> I use this or clubman original every day.  I really like the classic touch.  Yah it burns a bit...its supposed to.  If your skin is VERY sensitive, well ok this isn&#x27;t for you.  They do have sensitive skin care products.</li>
    <li> Ahhh, the fresh scent of some old fashioned bay rum.  I grew up in a barbershop and the Clubman Bay Rum and Pinaud are two scents that are near and dear to my heart.  This scent is masculine, refreshing, and overall wonderful.  However, it starts off quite spicy at first, like a heavy cinnamon and all-spice.  This does begin to wear off quite quickly, and finishes with an outdoorsy strong scent of a fresh cut.  Those who know this scent will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> The sting means it&#x27;s working to tone your skin. Then, the scent left behind can only be described as awesome. I feel like captain Morgan every time I splash it on.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Not over powering like some girly fragrances. Doesn&#x27;t last for days and days, actually it should be reaplyed after a few hours, which I like also. You don&#x27;t smell like a tray of sample cologne. It&#x27;s just the way I like it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. It smells like being on vacation in the Islands somewhere. It&#x27;s not a heavy smell. Just sort of coconut, caramel, and light musk. He certainly thinks he is  a stud with it on. :)</li>
    <li> While the original is still my favorite this one is good as well. I&#x27;m not much for the spice and clove smells but this one is pretty good. Would go well on a nice warm summer day!</li>
    <li> Very similar smell as Old Spice.  Comes in a real classy plastic bottle.  Will wake you up after your morning shave!  Like it.</li>
    <li> Great old school scent. It gives a little sting after shaving but not a burn</li>
    <li> This bay rum is pretty good and its fairly cheaply priced. It&#x27;s not my favorite bay rum scented aftershave but it&#x27;s very pleasant. I wish it was in a glass bottle instead of plastic because the plastic doesn&#x27;t let products smell bloom the way it does if you decante in glass.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  After several months I can still say, GREAT aftershave!  Does not burn.  It&#x27;s more of a mild warm feeling for about 20 seconds along with the great rum smell that is faint but lasts for hours. Best of all, my wife LOVES the mild rum smell ;}</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this and was very pleased, says it is an &amp;#34;old times&amp;#34; after shave that he never find..very happy</li>
    <li> smells fantastic.  Drives my wife crazy.</li>
    <li> best priced bay rum scent out there. starts out spicy, and quickly  mellows to a nice, sweet and spicy scent.</li>
    <li> I love bay rum fragrance. Gives you that fresh from the Barber shop feel and smell. If your a wet shave guy and like old school stuff, this is it.</li>
    <li> I decided to re-write my review and simplify.  My old review was too verbose, and people didn&#x27;t find it helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that the perfection of Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum can best be demonstrated in a (imperfect) Haiku:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use Clubman Bay Rum&lt;br /&gt;Hot women will fondle you&lt;br /&gt;Your wife may leave you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider yourself warned, and consider this amazing product at the same time.  Wonderful scent.  Your wife will love it when she smells it, but then she&#x27;ll hate it as she realizes that she is no longer the only person enjoying you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife left me, tried to file a civil suit against Pinaud for ruining the marriage, but then she smelled me when I was talking to her lawyers.  She dropped the suit, and I haven&#x27;t slept since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re welcome.to get sniffed by random women and have quick flings, try Clubman.  If you want to meet women in the produce department and get thrown onto a sack and set onto a kitchen counter top, try Lime Sec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what other consumers have said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D.S.:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Old School\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. S.B.:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Oh my goodness.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W.R.:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Accepted.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony D.:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This was by far one of the very best\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W.F. Rivera:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;In Haiku\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Classic smell you cant go wrong wearing bay rum.</li>
    <li> Great smell with a fair amount of lasting power compared to other bay rums</li>
    <li> It smells great. I hope you are well versed in martial arts because you will be fighting off all the ladies out there. If you are a sissy, this will make you feel like a real man. If you are already a real man, this stuff will increase your testicular cleavage by 50%.</li>
    <li> Have you ever smelled some punk covered in Axe body spray? Thats what punk loser smells like. Bay Rum is a manly smell, like an old school barber shop.</li>
    <li> Very masculine Bay Rum scent. I love this!!</li>
    <li> This is a classic scent. I&#x27;ve been using this as an aftershave for years. Brings you back to the days in a barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharp scent with strong cloves. Doesn&#x27;t overpower for too long and it will wake you up after a good shave.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this aftershave. I wish it would last longer than an hour.</li>
    <li> Love the aroma, but wish it lasted longer.  Good old school bay rum.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care much for this one. I&#x27;ve never used any Bay Rum so they may all smell like this but this has much too much of a &amp;#34;clove&amp;#34; smell for me. I really don&#x27;t intend this as a knock to the product but, it reminds me of &amp;#34;clove cigarettes&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve smelled in the past. I just don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> Has a distinctive scent, different from most other men&#x27;s colognes - not the usual woodsy or spicy scents.  Somewhat strong - use sparingly till you are familiar with the product. Breakproof plastic bottle, a plus.</li>
    <li> My husband hated it, nothing like the other bay rums I have purchased for him.</li>
    <li> Not as sweet as a lot of the Bay Rum soaps out there, but a touch more on the clove/musk side. Everyone has their own opinion on scents, so all I can offer is my own. Some would say that this wouldn&#x27;t be enjoyed by younger gentlemen, but I&#x27;m a 27 year old bachelor and I&#x27;m more than okay with it. I think it&#x27;s distinguished. Worst case scenario, it&#x27;s a nice change-of-pace scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astringent qualities are great, and leaves my skin in good condition after a shave.</li>
    <li> This was bought for the senior resident facility I volunteer for.  The gentlemen like the light fresh scent.  I think the ladies do too!</li>
    <li> thanks so much came quickly very happy with it</li>
    <li> Great old-school barber shop scent!  Burns a little, but totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Simple, classic scent. Smells of a slight cinnamon and piney type fragrance. If you are a man who wants to smell nice but doesn&#x27;t like the smell of frilly cologne, this is probably your best bet.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product smells, feels and leave my skin refreshed.  I use it as an aftershave and cologne.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of the Clubman line of aftershaves, and here&#x27;s why. It smells great, not just like straight rum. When you splash it on after a close shave, it doesn&#x27;t just feel like an alcohol/astringent burn. It feels...spicy. Very nice! It also doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry or tight - it actually feels more like a moisturizer as the day progresses. The smell of the aftershave is undeniably manly and full of spice, but evolves to a sweet, almost buttery rum by the end of the day. I love this aftershave, and I hope that you will too!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews for this product. They were all correct. The first time i smelled it (from the leaky bottle, that will be replaced), I thought....ugh, this is gross. I smelled it again after it dried out. WOW!!! LOVE IT...The replacement is on its way. Had to throw it out as the bottle was defective and leaking</li>
    <li> A refreshing and pleasing bay rum at a surprisingly low price. Well balanced bay rum with overtones of spice clove and cinnamon. Pinaud Clubman is as complex and interesting a scent as other \\&quot;more precious\\&quot; island bay rums. Lasts as long as any. Have read other comments about an alcohol burn; they must be drinking the stuff. I use it as an aftershave or cologne and have no burning issue (groan) even after shaving my head.</li>
    <li> Burns just like grandaddy&#x27;s aftershave. Got this after a shave down at the neighborhood barbershop and this is what they used there.</li>
    <li> Pulling the p now!!!!</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for a few weeks now and I love it. Smells awesome and lasts pretty much the whole day just as a cologne would. Stings like hell when you put it on, but hey, we&#x27;re men. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product and I will be re-buying.</li>
    <li> A mild but spicy aroma.  Another good product from Clubman</li>
    <li> Very nice manly smell. I love putting this on and having my wife smell me. SHE LIKES IT!</li>
    <li> Of all the Clubman products this one is absolutely my favorite. Nice spicy scent with good staying power.</li>
    <li> I have a $40 bottle of Bay Rum from another company and like this twice as much.  Nice spicy Bay Rum scent and not too astringent after the shave.</li>
    <li> Comes in a cheesy plastic bottle which does not make it easy to pour small amounts.  Pretty strong odor--sorry, at this price it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;, heavy on the cloves, but I like it.</li>
    <li> Very nice, clean, spicy (does roasted cinnamon/nutmeg make sense?), with citrus undertones. Doesn&#x27;t last long, but at this price point, what do you want the world? Good smelling basic aftershave.</li>
    <li> This is the first bay rum I&#x27;ve used.  I think it&#x27;s pretty good.  I&#x27;m in my mid-20s.  The internet seemed to have a lot of negative things said about men in their 20s using bay rum, but I can tell you it&#x27;s not so true with Virgin Island Bay Rum.  I can say this is a refreshing fragrance that I can use daily without concern for the occasion.  At least as far as I&#x27;m can tell, it does not at all smell like old men.  The notes remind me of autumnal spices and also citrus, like Triple Sec.  Sillage is decent--it will last through the morning work hours without turning foul.  I call it wearable confidence in a bottle!  I don&#x27;t recommend drinking it; use as directed...</li>
    <li> Simply put, this is the best Bay Rum available.  The aroma is warm and inviting, hints of cloves, bay and some citrus.  The bite fades quickly and is soothing.  Performance, scent and pricing make this my go to Bay Rum,</li>
    <li> Very good after shave, great fragrance. Nothing beats Clubman after shaves !!</li>
    <li> Odd as it sounds, I bought this for my dog.  I watched a YouTube video where an older English gentleman was giving instructions on how to groom a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, which I have.  At the end of the video, he discusses how he mixes a 50/50 solution of Bay Rum and water, sprays it on a flat brush, and uses it as the final grooming step as he brushes it through the dog&#x27;s coat.  He said they don&#x27;t object to the scent, and he was correct.  It helps keep &#x27;dog smell&#x27; in check, and doesn&#x27;t overpower the room.  I think I just might try it for myself as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very familiar with classic aftershaves. But, I&#x27;ve used this about 8 times and it seems pretty good. It&#x27;s got a pretty intense burn when you first put it on. Then, it reduces to a warm feeling followed by a pseudo skin numbness. It makes my skin feel tight. Also, my wife likes the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds o f shaving lotions but have never found one I wanted to stay with.This lotion not only smells good but refreshes and lasts for the day.</li>
    <li> This is manly....YES MANLY....like kill a grizzly bear with your bare hands manly......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic aftershave, or splash....cool as Jimmy Buffett sipping rum under a coconut tree!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Great smell only wishes it would last all day.</li>
    <li> Did you ever wonder how pirates managed to score with the ladies considering they&#x27;d been on a ship without a shower for weeks at a time?  Well my friend, you&#x27;re about to find out.  This smell is a throwback to those times and believe me when I tell you, it&#x27;s pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the day, pirates and sailors figured out they could add leaves and spices (bay leaves, cloves, etc.) to a bottle of rum and the essential oils from said leaves and spices would mix with the rum.  When these stinky seafarers were about to come ashore you can guess what they doused themselves with to dull their stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clubman has managed to recreate this ancient product and now you too can smell like a pirate and nab some booty.  Use it as an aftershave, a cologne or any time you want to wipe away the stink of the day.  And at just under $7 a bottle you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I am beating off the old ladies with a stick ;-)  Strong at first, mellows nicely after an hour or so, a manly burn when applied&lt;br /&gt;Great smell, my wife likes it and that&#x27;s good enough for me</li>
    <li> This aftershave doesn&#x27;t have as much sting as I&#x27;d been hoping for, but I can overlook that because of how good it smells.  The smell is a warm, cinnamon-y, bay-tree type smell.  It&#x27;s how a man should smell after a good shave.  I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> If you like Bay rum you will like this. I have tried weaker Bay Rums. I have heard of stronger Bay Rums but have not encountered them</li>
    <li> As with any bay rum aftershave, you should expect not only the normal aftershave sting when applying this, but a lasting burn that you will feel throughout the day. I used this on September 19th (International Talk Like a Pirate Day) and I smelled like a pirate, all day. Apparently, pirates smell like cloves. I don&#x27;t know if this is because they use a lot of cloves when they cook, or because, historically, they raided a lot of spice ships carrying cloves. Either way, go to the grocery store, pick up a bottle of cloves from the spice isle, pay for it and smell it. That&#x27;s what this will smell like. If you like that smell, then you&#x27;ll like this. To me, it just didn&#x27;t seem to fit in place. Plus, the burn throughout the day was considerable, almost to the point of being unpleasant. It might be good on a pulled muscle, though.</li>
    <li> Your sexy sexy Grandpa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he was a wild merchant marine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going port to port.  Causing trouble and breaking hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell like real men used to.</li>
    <li> Smell is pretty good Smells like the Caribbean.</li>
    <li> Good, old-fashioned scent.  My only gripe is that it wears out within a couple of hours.  If it were a bit stronger, I&#x27;d be all about it.</li>
    <li> I love Bay Rum. I&#x27;m a fan of Clubman products, so I naturally decided to try theirs. It&#x27;s got a good clean scent, with enough spice to make you feel warm. Yet it&#x27;s tropical and fairly alcoholic so it makes you feel cool. You can really wear this year round. I&#x27;ve heard some people say this isn&#x27;t as nice as the original formulation from the 1940s, and I&#x27;m sure it isn&#x27;t...but what is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on with a medium scent and mellows very quickly. In my opinion, the only problem with this product is that the scent doesn&#x27;t really last the day. I&#x27;d say 4-5 hours is all you&#x27;re going to get. But it&#x27;s inexpensive, so put a little in a tester or bottle and refresh during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was first introduced to the scent via Royall Bay Rhum. I bought a spray bottle of that and it lasts forever. It&#x27;s a longer-lasting and &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; scent, so it&#x27;s my preferred Bay Rum. But Clubman is my every-day scent because it stands up to value assessment.</li>
    <li> My father used this fragrance in the &#x27;70&#x27;s. I love it and the memories it invokes. It actually works better as a room/car freshener than an aftershave. The more subtle the tones of bay leaf are, the better. Try sprinkling it on an inconspicuous part of something in a room or the car. But be careful it does stain. The fragrance is super clean and masculine. Much better than  &#x27;Little Tree&amp;#34; type fresheners.</li>
    <li> The sent is great but at first but does not seem to last as long as other splash on&#x27;s I have owned.</li>
    <li> Yeah this is going to smell exactly as you imagine it will. I bought some of the &#x27;classic&#x27; aftershaves to use after I shave, which is at home in the evening when nobody else can smell me but I need something on my face. It&#x27;s fun, it will make you smell like Grandpa. You may even wear it out, assuming you&#x27;re either a married man or out with your pals on a bowling night.</li>
    <li> I have tried Pinaud Original, Special Reserve, and Lilac after shaves.  I don&#x27;t think the Original will ever be beaten, but I&#x27;ve wanted to try this for sometime now.  I definitely like it and its a nice change from the Original that I&#x27;ve been using daily.  I should say I don&#x27;t really like the scent of the Special Reserve as it gives me a headache and is way too strong.  The Lilac is decent but I don&#x27;t quite get that manly feeling I&#x27;m looking for when it hits my nostrils.  The Bay Rum is a nice manly scent that is not overwhelming, and I do plan to use it once or twice a week, but I&#x27;m just not quite ready to jump on the Pirate ship and sail away from my Original...not yet anyway.</li>
    <li> Very strong cinnamon smell, but it dies down after a few minutes. It burns too much to use as an aftershave, even when mixed with a drop or two of water. I plan to use as a body splash. Overall, not a bad product, but I was expecting more.</li>
    <li> Typical Clubman aftershave. Has a strong cinnamon scent and really not alot of bay rum..also has a strong alcohol sting which is very Clubman like. Smooths and tones very well and is inexspensive. The scent is not long lasting and really doesnt change much over time like some of the others.  Special Reserve and the Original have this one beat for scent and lasting power. If you like Clubman and Pinaud add this one to your collection. Im glad I did.  Update on 4/7/13 When my bottle of Clubman Bay Rum was about one quarter empty I took some Benjamins Bay Rum and added it until it was full again.  Took away the strong cinnamon scent and replaced it with more of a Bay Rum scent.  Nice. [[ASIN:B004YY2SZ8 Benjamins Bay Rum]]</li>
    <li> Not sure I like this.  Was expecting something different.  Mostly smells like alcohol with a hint of something that I have yet to identify.  It may grow on me after I wear it a while.</li>
    <li> After reading many of the reviews, I decided to give this a shot.  I like it.  It may not be for everyone, but I think it smells pleasant.  My wife said I smelled like Christmas.  She also liked it.  Again, it&#x27;s different from your average cheap cologne, Brut, Old Spice, etc.  But it&#x27;s nice.  I wish my local drugstore carried more Pinaud products.  Some of them are good.  For the record, I also like the Clubman Vanilla which I saw wasn&#x27;t popular with some folks.  I only wished the scent lasted a bit longer.</li>
    <li> This spicey clove after shave is my father&#x27;s favorite, ever since he discovered it decades ago. It is not as heavy as some I have smelled and the other notes are not floral (eww) so this has been a winner! I always buy him 2 or 3 bottles at a time because he uses it so much. This is something that when he dies, I will continue to get it, just so I can remember what my dad smelled like. He is my hero.  If you like cloves, spice and a hint of cinammon, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I liked the spicy scent, but my wife hated it! Before you buy this, ask your barber to splash some on you to make sure those that kiss you can still stand you!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, last for most of the day not to strong.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought I was gonna hate it. However, after wearing it once, I was hooked! I only wish it was a bit stronger and that it laster longer, but this is still a great aftershave.</li>
    <li> Clubman...great....awesome scents....what else can you say.  This is the type of aftershave all real men should own.  Not that wimpy stuff from walmart.</li>
    <li> Great feeling and scent after shaving, but a little strong on the clove.</li>
    <li> I love the musky dark spicy smell of this. I don&#x27;t care if anyone else does. I do and I wear it proudly. Smell me I say! I am awesome with this scent. It makes me 10 inches taller. Seriously though, it&#x27;s a good manly musky spicy scent.</li>
    <li> Love it! It has that old time 1930s barber shop smell to it. It&#x27;s spicy and strong. Mostly cloves, cinnamon and rum in that order of strength. I put some on my fingers to test it and I can still smell it over 2 hours later. It&#x27;s not for everyone but when your done smelling like a teenage pop star, this bottle will be waiting!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive alternative to St. Johns Bay Rum.</li>
    <li> Purchased on a whim as I was tired of my other brand, Axe, constantly changing out their scents every couple of years &amp;#34;for something better&amp;#34;. Wanted to get to something old school, and I have always enjoyed spice like scents, but not &amp;#34;old spice&amp;#34;. This goes way beyond what I expected. It&#x27;s a strong smell if sniffed direct from bottle, and also has a strong scent when first applied, but it does mellow out rather quickly and is a very nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girl loves it, stating it&#x27;s a really nice smell. Others at work have also stated it smells &amp;#34;like old spice, but not as dry&amp;#34;. Personally not an old spice guy as it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; in smell for me. Probably due to it being marketed as a woman&#x27;s perfume when developed. Bay rum smell on the other hand is well worth it if you want to have a unique scent which smells clean and not &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; as the newer products on the market.</li>
    <li> The bay rum scent is a good departure from the musk and aqua velva smell of the other garden variety after shaves.  It smells a bit like gingerbread, but I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
    <li> I like the spicey fragrance it was probably my third favorite out of them all would probably use this one again.</li>
    <li> Great smelling aftershave. Beats most of the aftershave products I use to use. Gives a great refreshing feeling after shaving.</li>
    <li> The classic smell of the barber shop of my youth. Both subtle and strikingly manly. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> I do enjoy this aftershave.  It def is not something I would use on a daily basis as there is a sweet, candy note to the scent.  You can tell this is a Clubman aftershave, has some pretty good bite to it.  Leaves my face feeling soft, yet not dry feeling.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes bay rum, but beware, there is a really sweet afternote.</li>
    <li> An old time classic.  For all the wet shavers out there, this is the stuff to use.  My dad used this and my barber used to do my neck and ears with a straight razor and always put this on when he was done.  He said it helps the small cuts that a razor leaves.</li>
    <li> Hubby now only uses this product and he asked for it because he loves it.  He started using it after his barber used it on him.</li>
    <li> I love the clove and citric and spicy smell of this aftershave, however my husband dislikes the smell of cloves, Guess this will go to my Dad for Christmas. I know he will like it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a light bay rum aftershave since Burt&#x27;s Bees quit their after shave lotion. This is it a very light scent which &amp;#34;takes you to the tropics&amp;#34; that I truly love.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> like this really good</li>
    <li> Strong spice scent when first applied but leaves a great aroma that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I already have a DE safety razor, a shaving brush, and Col. Conk&#x27;s Amber shaving soap, and wanted a good aftershave to complete the oldschool shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum aftershave goes on quite strong, but quickly subsides to a sophisticated, but very low-key scent.  I&#x27;m not a fan of liquor, and I&#x27;m really not sure what inspired me to buy this scent, because it really doesn&#x27;t suit me, but I was pretty well stuck with it.  It&#x27;s not a bad scent by any means, but it would seem to be better suited to a sophisticated black man.  It rather reminds me of the Big Band era, and the unique and entrancing Creole spin so highly favored in New Orleans.  I gave it to my best friend, a black guy who is more of a brother to me than my own blood, and he LOVES it!  He has very sensitive skin, and breaks out every time he shaves.  Since he started using the Bay Rum aftershave, his face has been smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum.  Was actually a bit jealous for a few weeks--until I found the classic scented Clubman aftershave at a local Walgreens.  Now I have the ladies!  Sorry brother!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful Bay Rum after shave.  It has a strong scent of cloves/cinnamon, so be warned about that if that&#x27;s not your thing.  I love using this and keep it in my after shave rotation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad this is available for purchase on line, as none of the main line drug stores carry these products any longer.  I absolutely love the scent and it brings me back to my childhood visits to the barber shop when the barber would shave the back of my neck and then use the bayrum.  Nothing else like it!</li>
    <li> After browsing Amazon for old school after shaves, I placed an order for this product. It has an amazing scent that im sure that women will love, my only complaint is that the scent fades quickly. Will purchase more for an everyday scent.</li>
    <li> An old timey scent for an old timey guy. The ladies still seem to like this fresh from the barbershop aroma.</li>
    <li> As a boy back home in central New York I recal the barbers using two Clubman bay rum products.  I found this one at Amazon. It is exactly as I recall and a great old-time aftershave.</li>
    <li> I love all Clubman products and this is no exception.  It performs great to tone and condition the skin after a shave with little or no burn.  The scent is spicy and not overpowering at all.  If you are looking for a wonderfully different scent from today&#x27;s over priced and feminine aftershaves and colognes, this is the one!</li>
    <li> I been looking for the real deal in Bay Rum and this is it!  Cool looking label, looks great by my messy bathroom sink. Feels refreshing after you scrap your face with a blade. Feels like you are lying on a beach in one of those beer commercials.  Only negatives are I would prefer a glass bottle and I don;t really know if women dig it or not?</li>
    <li> Classic bay rum scent which lasts. At first it is strong, but it mellows out. It is in my weekly rotation. If you like bay rum scents, then give it a try.</li>
    <li> I love the regular Clubman scent and really like Bay Rum, so I thought I would enjoy this. But it has some funky smell that didn&#x27;t sit right with me. I will stay with the regular Clubman and when I want the Bay Rum scent I will try other products.</li>
    <li> I bought this without reading any of the comments. I just started shaving with a DE razor and was looking at aftershaves that went against the norm. When I saw this, it instantly reminded me of my father. It was always on his dresser and was the only after shave he would use. Today, I shaved and put this stuff on and thought I was hit with pepper spray on my face. After a few seconds of saying &amp;#34;damn&amp;#34; it settled in and felt good. Yeah, this will wake you up, not for the timid.</li>
    <li> Was very dissatisfied with the virgin bay rum, it smelled very different than I was exspecting, I wish I would have ordered the regular after shave lotio.</li>
    <li> Such a nice scent, everybody should at least try this aftershave. It also seems to give an unusual warmth to my skin(aside from burning if it was a rough shave) that my other after shaves do not. Very pleasant and smells great.</li>
    <li> Smelled very cheap and more like cinnamon than anything.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells really great and wakes me up, for me the scent does not last long so i just use it to wake up then put on the clubman special reserve aftershave. I rate it very high for what it is cause it smells amazing not for mamby pamby men</li>
    <li> Clubman has stayed true to itself with this classic scent. My Grandpa used to use this after his shaves. I LOVE the scent and the good burn. Great product that has stayed true to it&#x27;s roots when a lot of others out there are trying to reinvent themselves for whatever asinine reason...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is classic Bay Rum and lingers for just the right amount of time.</li>
    <li> The product itself is excellent. It is a very strong scent that really does smell very similar to Rum. If you don&#x27;t like that strong of a smell, then this one probably isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my complaint here is with the bottle, not the product. The bottle arrived &amp;#34;damaged&amp;#34;, as in, the bottle was not sealed and the cap was halfway off. about 1/4 of the product spilled in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t imagine this is a regular occurance, but I feel like others should be aware of the possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, my mail smelled amazing!</li>
    <li> smells like the rum of old cuts</li>
    <li> Heavy on the clove scent for sure, and it will actually numb your face after the burn sets in...&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty &#x27;hot&#x27; aftershave. High alcohol and clove scent ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I like the burn, enjoy the numb, and love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is strong for 15-20 minutes and fades away after 60 minutes or so. I&#x27;m sure there are better bay rum aftershaves out there, but this product is great for the price and I enjoy it on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;As a secondary bonus my wife has nothing bad to say about the smell of this product either... If your wife doesn&#x27;t like cloves don&#x27;t expect the same.</li>
    <li> Very good bay rum fragrance. A bit on the spicy side but i like that.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, strong manly, but nice odor.........will last for a while. - C4</li>
    <li> Old time aftershave, do not know what the older receipe smelled like but love this . Use it daily and it does not you over with the smell.</li>
    <li> REALLY LOVE THIS AFTER A FRESH HAIRCUT OR IF U WANNA SMELL SPICEY!</li>
    <li> I love the original and vanilla Pinaud aftershaves.  I made a mistake getting this one.  Maybe it&#x27;s the dark color but the scent reminds me more of molasses than bay rum.</li>
    <li> It is pretty good stuff. It is a great classic bay rum scent that has a real good spice to it. It is a little powerful on the cloves right at first but mellows out quite nicely. Sometimes I like to pair it with a simple musk scent as well.</li>
    <li> I finally purhcase Bay Ruun as an aftershave.  I use Gilette safety razors, and luve the way this smells as an after-shave.  Gr8 service from the vendor, and a gr8 price.  JUST BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very mild smelling aftershave.  The spiciness of the bay really comes through and finishes in a smooth scent.  Is not very overpowering at all.</li>
    <li> Spicy, manly, and pairs well with any number of citrus scents if you want to cut the sweetness.  A great, unobtrusive scent, that stands strongly apart from the overpowering omnipresence of Axe, Polo, etc.</li>
    <li> One of the single most classic old scents out there...  Warm, rich, spicy, and with a bracing burn.  Scent barely lingers a few hours, but does fade rather quickly.  Overall, one of the best, classic aftershaves you can possibly buy, and at a fantastic price point.  There is a reason that Clubman has been around for as long as they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S... if you haven&#x27;t tried the Pinaud Quinine hair tonic... it&#x27;s worth a shot.  Odd smell at first, but it very quickly grows on you, and the women in my life all seem to love it.</li>
    <li> This product has a very strong cinnamon smell that I personally just don&#x27;t care for.  I will definitely do more research prior to ordering any more products such as this.</li>
    <li> Very strong spicy cologne, strong ginger sting. Horrible and CHEAP smelling. I used to receive colognes like this as gifts from my cheap relatives that were bought from dollar stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this unless you&#x27;re an old man who has lost most of your sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realistically, I wanted to give this a 2-star rating, but the reviews for this cologne do not match how ACTUALLY bad it is. I had to knock down a star to compensate for the unrealistic reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it was very very cheap, and I regret it.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of this bay rum. Everyone has a different take on bay rum, and this is by far one of my favorite mixtures of it.</li>
    <li> plastic bottle lacks quality and not very suitable for gift. From the exterior looks it seems dated material. Although the price is good but wont buy it again, its good for fun party games and giveaways.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for that scent that reminds you of old times this is it. Now I must say this is not for anyone, it has a very particular scent to alcohol with cloves and spices. If you are looking for an aftershave to go to the office...this might not be the one. Now if your looking for a cooling sensation with a warm scent during the winter this is for you.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this item. He asked for it as a birthday present again this year. It smells great, but you have to use it sparingly. Will definitely buy this again when we run out.</li>
    <li> I mean seriously, even if you&#x27;re just not sure.  At this price, why not just pick up a bottle and try it? If you hate it, give it away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently went on a bit of a spree to try some different aftershaves.  Since I loved the scent of the [[ASIN:B002JKSP38 Colonel Conk Bay Rum Shave Soap]] that I had bought when I switched to a DE razor, I focused mainly on that scent. The two bay rum aftershaves that I ended up trying were this one and the [[ASIN:B0066GR55K Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum Aftershave]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no clear winner between the two; on the contrary, I&#x27;ve found both of them to have their strengths and weaknesses compared to the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  The Clubman wins by a mile here -- The CC is almost triple the price per bottle, and more than quadruple the price if you figure out the cost in dollars per ounce (the CC comes in a 4oz bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Of course this is subjective. The Clubman is milder, a little more sweet. The CC relies a little more heavily on the spice/clove side of things. Overall, I feel like there&#x27;s more depth and complexity to the CC.  But the Clubman isn&#x27;t as bad right out of the bottle -- maybe 10 minutes or so after application, the Clubman has settled in to a nice fragrance.  I feel like the CC needs at least a good half hour; this is wife-tested. She doesn&#x27;t like the CC at all when I first apply it, but 30-45 minutes later she changes her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intensity:  Hard to determine when you&#x27;re the one wearing it.  I can smell both of them pretty much all day, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s on MY face.  My nose is also on my face, so based on proximity alone it makes sense that I&#x27;d smell it longer than everyone else.  This may be another good wife test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:  CC is the clear winner.  The CC is packaged in a nice, dark brown glass bottle that looks a little like an old-fashioned medicine bottle.  The Clubman is packaged in a cheap plastic bottle that looks like something you&#x27;d find at a gas station.  When I opened my package from Amazon, there was a dent in the corner of the bottle that had created a tiny hole. There was aftershave soaking into the packing material.  I couldn&#x27;t return it, so I transferred it to a small glass flask with a rubber stopper.  This makes it difficult to apply because of the width of the flask mouth, but it&#x27;s the only option I had available to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face: Both give you that nice, smooth aftershavey feel.  But I think the feel of the CC is better.  It includes witch hazel and glycerine in the ingredients, I think this may make the difference. Lately I&#x27;ve been adding a couple of drops of witch hazel to my palm along with the Clubman before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of ingredients:  The win goes to CC here as well.  The ingredient list of the Clubman is: Alcohol, water, fragrance, and a few artificial colors.  The CC on the other hand: Alcohol, Witch Hazel, Glycerine, Spices &amp; Extracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall?  Well, I personally prefer the Captain&#x27;s Choice.  But they smell different enough that I keep them both in my arsenal. Ultimately, opinions will always differ, but I can say that for less than seven dollars, you might as well give this stuff a shot!station.

    <li> I sprinkle in my shoes at night. Feet smell great the next day.</li>
    <li> This is a nice smooth scent. It is timeless and will never go out of style. My boyfriend wears it everyday and I absolutely love the smell. Its not to strong just nice.</li>
    <li> I have looked long and hard and far a good aftershave and this is that great aftershave. Women love the smell of it and I have been asked about it multiple times. Though I have gotten this from a couple of people that it smells like the oil at a catholic conformation.</li>
    <li> On one hand, I like how this stuff works. It burns more than any aftershave I&#x27;ve used, and I like that. Bracing! It leaves your face feeling curiously hard and rubbery as well. Maybe &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; is a more attractive word choice. I don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s in it (I&#x27;m not a chemist able to decode the ingredients) but something in there is like a protective shellac for the face. Most aftershaves simply feel like alcohol and water that evaporate and leave a little scent behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, the scent. Like a bizarre, poisoned pumpkin pie. Cinnamon, cloves, something else (the bay leaves maybe?) On a good day it is sort of tolerable, but only if I rinse it off in cold water after a few minutes (which reduces the smell but curiously does not reduce the effects mentioned above.) Otherwise, I can&#x27;t take it. It&#x27;s just too weird and powerful. And the bottle advises to &amp;#34;Splash freely all over the body.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m definitely not inclined to try that.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a pleasant experience. It was not. Sorry, but, I was very Disappointed.Just not an Aroma for me. I would much rather use my Old Spice any day. Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> Ah the scent of Bay Rum brings me to the islands of the Caribbean.  This is a manly scent and shouldn&#x27;t be worn by the pretty boyz of today.  It&#x27;s not overpowering or overly rum like.  It smells like warm cloves and other spices.  I only wished it lasted longer than the 3-4 hours that it does.</li>
    <li> Smells the best. Stings the hell out of your face after you shave. Be a man about it man. Man.</li>
    <li> Love it. Getting more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit too young to associate bay rum with a barbershop smell, and my only context for what rum should smell like is Captain Morgan. Its definitely not as sweet smelling as C-Mo, but it&#x27;s a bit spicier, it&#x27;s definitely one of the more manly smells I can think of. I wish it came in candle form now. This is the only thing I wear out now. It smells really strong in the bottle, but once you put it on, it fades just a bit and leaves a wonderful scent. My fiancee loves the smell, and it stays on for a surprising amount of time. The bottle was pretty terrible, so that had to be replaced, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be buying this again and again.</li>
    <li> Smells awful. By awful I mean like I splashed on cough syrup, but forgot to sweeten it.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously AWFUL which is disappointing....</li>
    <li> Does not have a very strong Bay Rum Scent, It may be right for you if you are looking for a lighter scent of Bay Rum!</li>
    <li> Be a man, love the burn!</li>
    <li> My wife loves the way this smells. Combined with the manliest looking beard I have ever grown, this scent makes me just about perfect.</li>
    <li> Smell like a man or pirate.  Whatever.  Loved it!</li>
    <li> On a whim I decided to give this one a try and I think it will now be the one I will use. It has a nice old time scent reminicent from the old barber shops (almost like Cloves and Leather) and you can feel this one find and soothe any of your nicks. I was amazed on well it did this as my old one never came close.&lt;br /&gt;Its definately a man scent and you really only need a small amount so this bottle will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. It is a great scent no matter the time of year.</li>
    <li> The aftershave makes me look forward to the days I have to shave because I know I will get to smell like bay leaves and spices all day. Smells a lot like Old Spice aftershave, a lit bit better though.</li>
    <li> Not a bad version of bay rum for the price.  A bit spicier than botanical, which is not precisely what I was looking for.  Either way, it is a pleasant smell.  Would probably buy Col. Conk&#x27;s before buying this one again, however.</li>
    <li> i had been wanting to try bay rum scent for a long time after reading so many great reviews. i&#x27;m not sure what to say. DEFintely clove!! it is growing on me though and the price was worth giving it a go. so no complaints</li>
    <li> Douse myself with this all the time, chicks dig it. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Excellent smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long/</li>
    <li> Awesome. If you like spice scents and especially clove you will love it. Wish they made this in cologne!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a signature scent that would not cost me an arm and a leg.  I am also looking for a manly scent, not some fru-fru smelling stuff that was designed by some metro-sexual who thinks men need to smell like flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to smell like a MANLY man!  And the Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum seems to fit the bill.  A generous 6 oz (can&#x27;t take it on your carry on luggage) for $6.  Heck, you pay $40-$50 plus for and ounce and a 1/2 of  wimp juice from the department store!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a little on when I got it, and after about 10 minutes walked over to my lady and asked what she thought...  I could not get her tongue out of my mouth and her hand out of my pan.... well you get the idea....  Old Spice eat your heart out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint albeit maybe it is not justified, is that it comes in a cheap plastic container. The plastic was a bit flimsy.  Perhaps that keeps costs down.  I think this is worthy of glass!  I am going to find a small 1/2-1 oz glass or ceramic bottle that I can put a little in for when I am flying.  I want to smell like a manly man and have all those lady flight attendants dropping their panties for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UmgowaaA!  Mongo, smell good, want woman!</li>
    <li> Not quite a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; bay rum, sad to say.  It works, but it could honestly be better.  Considering how inexpensive it is to make a real bay rum, I&#x27;m surprised that this just doesn&#x27;t make the cut.  It has an artificial aroma to it.</li>
    <li> Stick with the original, This was just not my favorite scent. Smell is so subjective, not sure how to describe the smell...very spicy....herb type of smell. CLUBMAN is a great product, read some reviews and make up your own mind.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent, it&#x27;s as simple as that. There&#x27;s a cinnamon twang to it that just bugs me. Time for me to keep searching for that elusive scent that I like...</li>
    <li> My favorite barber used to use this but has since switched, so I had to buy it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle it arrives in is plastic and has a weak cap, but otherwise the product is fine.</li>
    <li> This Bay Rum smells good, but it&#x27;s not as complex as some--the major note is clove. It also wears off very quickly. This is not one of the better Clubman products, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Product is ok.  Very week scent.  Probably would not order again.  This was not what I have purchased in the Virgin Islands.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great. I wear it everyday and have heard only compliments. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Smells like a mix of rum / fruit cake mixed with P&amp;G old spice.  Or candy.  You know the kind, green gummy with sugar on it.  Spice drops.</li>
    <li> Tried this product after a nice, close DE shave. Guess I should have paid more attention to the label that states &amp;#34;Flammable&amp;#34;. Product has a very high alcohol content. Got a nice burning sensation when I applied the product. Not sure where the claim that it &amp;#34;cools, tones and refreshes&amp;#34; comes from. The scent was pleasant enough once the alcohol dissipated. Bottom line: Did not enjoy it as an after shave. Price is reasonable but really can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! Love how it smells on my Honey!</li>
    <li> This is another classic from Pinaud. Should be a staple of every wet shaver&#x27;s medicine cabinet, just like the Pinaud Clubman.</li>
    <li> I first tried this, and other Pinaud products while working in Country clubs. The Golf Pros stocked the locker room with Bay Rum, Talc, Shampoo and Aftershave items for the members. After I finished a round with my crew, or after 14 hours behind the stoves I&#x27;d hit the showers and partake of the amenities provided. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bay Rum for me is a light scent. Spicy and a little woodsy. The aroma stays for a few hours, not overpowering. All I need is just a small dab and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells like you have been passed out drunk on rum</li>
    <li> I never tried this before, I&#x27;ve always been a classic Old Spice guy.  But this scent is classic all on it&#x27;s own, you&#x27;ll recognize it instantly as something men have been wearing for a long time.  It&#x27;s a rich, manly, mature scent.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  It goes a long way, but it&#x27;s not overpowering, either.</li>
    <li> Wear this quite often and plenty of compliments.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff !</li>
    <li> Sometimes I wake up and I say to myself, &amp;#34;I wish I could be like my grandfather.&amp;#34;  Now, mind you, my grandfather has been dead for about 30 years, so I don&#x27;t want to be too much like him, but with regard to how he smelled after a good shave, well, this is the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;Not too strong with a fairly fast &amp;#34;half-life&amp;#34; dissipation, I highly recommend this if you want to be like my grandfather was before he died.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of my grandpa...</li>
    <li> A Deep, Rich, Long Lasting Manly Smell. This stuff burns like hell, so man up ladies. You didn&#x27;t hear you Pa or Grandpa complain about it did you. The Smell has always maked me imagine some 1800&#x27;s East India Company or Royal Marine Man simply splashing just distilled Caribbean Rum on their face after a shave.</li>
    <li> not as good as the original product. but no were as bad as the vanilla that i bought.i dont recommend it.</li>
    <li> GOOD STUFF. EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN CONCEPT OF WHAT BAY RUM SHOULD SMELL LIKE. THIS IS HEAVY CLOVE. CINIMON, BAY, MILD CITRUS. IT IS A GOOD BAY RUM. OGOLALLA&#x27;S IS THE ONLY OTHER BRAND THAT COMES CLOSE. IT HAS A PRETTY STRONG SCENT BUT IT TONES DOWN AS TIME GOES ON. I WOULD RECOMEND ANY OF THE PINAUD PRODUCTS YOU CANT GO WRONG.</li>
    <li> Of all the Pinaud line of aftershaves, I like this one the best.  Very powerful bay aroma, with hints of clove, citrus, and cinnamon.  I think they actually use bay oil as one of the ingredients.  Unlike some of the other weaker aftershaves, this one does not fade away in a couple hours.  You will definitely be smelling it throughout the day.  A great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Quality product. It arrived on time. Just not my favorite aftershave. If you&#x27;re into smells of the ole barbershop, this is for you.</li>
    <li> This smells great, a classic scent that brings up memories of barbershops and warm climates. Product has a slight &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; when applying, but in no way is that a bad thing. It feels like a great cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend, and will definitely be keeping this in stock.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent. Doesn&#x27;t last long, as it&#x27;s technically an aftershave and not a cologne.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to use this in place of cologne but it seems to lose its scent rather quickly.  Smells amazing though, perfect for summer or winter.</li>
    <li> very happy with the product. Pleasant scent after the initial application. Has a good sting to it to let you know you&#x27;ve put some on.</li>
    <li> Be really careful with this item. It is not clearly stated it&#x27;s hazardous material HAZMAT and we forward ship our orders to the Caribbean. This will cost us $285 to have it processed because of its alcohol content. Plus you cannot return hazardous materials to the seller. I guess it is a good aftershave, but I am yet to see it as it is impounded at our freight forwarders and will probably stay there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever get it, I will review the after shave and rate accordingly. The vendor should have made this very clear on the site their product contains hazardous materials.</li>
    <li> The product has an overall good smell, but I strongly feel like it has been cut with alcohol a little too much. I have smelled  a couple bay rums, and this one isn&#x27;t my absolute favorite. But my wife loves the smell regardless. I&#x27;ll keep it for her, but the next bay rum will be a different one and less cut. And, no, the burn of the alcohol after a fresh shave does not bother me one bit. Once mixed with your phermones, at least mine, it smells a whole lot better and lasts a good portion of the day. And if you don&#x27;t take many showers, I&#x27;m sure the alcohol amount in this product will kill all of your stinky bacteria and give you a slightly better scent that what you had before.</li>
    <li> This scent starts very strong with clove, but quickly fades to a smoky and spicy cinnamon/woodsy smell. The result is pleasant and not at all overpowering or offensive. Classic, but not old.</li>
    <li> This Bay Rum aftershave has a strong cinnamon smell to it that quickly settles down to a very pleasant milder scent.  I like it, and it feels good on my face after a shave.  My only complaint is the scent fades very quickly, which is surprising given how enduring the scent of Clubman&#x27;s Pinaud aftershave is.  If you want an aftershave to make your face feel good after shaving this is a good one to choose.  But if you want one that will have a scent throughout your day you will be happier with something else.</li>
    <li> This stuff just smells amazing. My wife loves the floral noes to it!</li>
    <li> excellent and well priced after shave.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel great and has a manly smell.  Whatch out for the alcohal sting.</li>
    <li> This is a very manly smell.  I love it on my husband.</li>
    <li> Okay for the price.  I think I&#x27;d rather pay more and get some Captain&#x27;s Choice.  I personally like the smell of Captain&#x27;s a lot more that the Clubman.</li>
    <li> Burns like hellfire after shaving but thats how I like my aftershave! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I like this bay rum better than some of the more expensive ones.  Not overly done with clove like most I&#x27;ve come by</li>
    <li> Great product, I have been using since the 20&#x27;s, that&#x27;s right...the 1920&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stings like hell, worth every second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for Metros or Wussies.</li>
    <li> A little goes a loooonnng way with this stuff. It is very, very strong and will overpower cologne. The scent lasts for many hours after application. If this is what you&#x27;re after then this is for you.</li>
    <li> For the purpose of after shave it works great for anyone that&#x27;s been to an old style barber it&#x27;s similar smells form them.</li>
