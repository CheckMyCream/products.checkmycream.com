      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful perfect red shade.  </li>
      <li>This colour is amazing.</li>
      <li>Also was not in any kind of plastic wrap or packaging material.</li>
      <li>Even if I had liked the color, I did not like this lipstick.</li>
      <li>and it had a nice satin</li>
      <li>Perfect craberry red,  gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
      <li>I really love the color of Continuous Cranberry.</li>
      <li>BETTER IDEA TO DO SO.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love Love it.</li>
      <li>After 4 hrs of coffee drinking, luncheon, and many kissy/huggy greetings, there had been NO TRANSFER...</li>
      <li>Love how it looks on me, but it does NOT stay on at all.  </li>
      <li>I bought lipstain and it has worked significantly better for me.  </li>
      <li>I am a make up artist by hobby, and i use a lot of brands, the reason I bought this is because I saw that these lipsticks were very pigmented, and smells not only good but really delicious, its a fruity smell that I just love.</li>
      <li>And this color, continuous cranberry, is the perfect rich shade of red for me.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
      <li>but I am fine with that.</li>
      <li>I used Lipchic over it (to increase staying power) and found the result to be fantastic.  </li>
      <li>no worries, it so cheap, I just kept it.</li>
      <li>By 6 hrs, some color fading had become obvious to me--still very nice, however.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a birthday present to myself, hoping that a bright color would perk up my appearance.  </li>
      <li>On one hand, it was good because you could press your lips together to smooth out any uneven patches.</li>
      <li>i wanted a nice red, this was it</li>
      <li>The colour is quite pigmented, very good for drug-store brand, and it is like a ruby colour, its matt, but has a subtle sheen to it, which I do not like...again</li>
      <li>The color of this lipstick is positively drop-dead-gorgeous!  </li>
      <li>I really did think the colour was true to what it was supposed to be</li>
      <li>The color is nice, the delivery was fast though they did take up a giant box for just one stick.....</li>
      <li>This lipstick is worth buying, for sure, I am going to buy my 3rd one from this collection.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a nice vibrant red that&#x27;ll stay on this is the lipstick for you!</li>
      <li>This actually works better than MAC Ruby Woo.  </li>
      <li>It will though last for many hours.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want to take the chance, consider not buying in the first place.</li>
      <li>I really liked this product, it last very well, its kind of matte finish but soft at the same time</li>
      <li>In order to get the best pigmented effect, my secret is, I layer it, first, i put some lip liner, on full lips, then i apply this, lastly I reapply again, then it stays for hours....</li>
      <li>Hight recommend it to shoppers who want amazing red classy look with affordable price.</li>
      <li>All in all, I really like this 14 hour lip color.</li>
      <li>, I really like it because I&#x27;m not a glossy person.</li>
      <li>IT IS VERY STICKY AND LOOKS LIKE POO ON.  </li>
      <li>When I cleaned it off with tissue,  it didn&#x27;t come off much.</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable, I would order it again.  </li>
      <li>The texture is so smooth on the lips compared to Mac which is so dry though it&#x27;s matte.  </li>
      <li>It was more like a dark wine!</li>
      <li>I read some other reviews and apparently the 14 hour lipstick stays on for a few people, but came off for many more.</li>
      <li>not the right color for me - way too red.</li>
      <li>I will say, that it lasts considerably longer than a normal lipstick.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>I LOVED the color and how it felt on my lips, but it seriously wouldn&#x27;t last longer than 45 minutes.  </li>
      <li>I doubt it would, but it certainly does last hours on end.  </li>
      <li>Ok...I see some mixed reviews in here, but when it comes to lipstick, we have to remember that its very personal...and not everyone like all the stuff.</li>
      <li>Old and does not go on well.</li>
      <li>This lipstick will last longer if you let it dry on your lips first before applying a gloss or having a sip of liquid</li>
      <li>The lipstick overall is by far one of my faves.</li>
      <li>It is dark and bold enough to make you look classy but not old.</li>
      <li>wore off on my first meal a few hour later after putting on.this is just a basic lipstick.</li>

<li> Old and does not go on well.</li>

<li> The lipstick overall is by far one of my faves.</li>
<li> It is dark and bold enough to make you look classy but not old.</li>
<li> wore off on my first meal a few hour later after putting on.this is just a basic lipstick.</li>
<li> and I mean like within 3 hours and fades easily as well transfers just as must as any other lipstick.</li>
<li> None of these last as long as they say,  </li>
<li> So I went on the hunt for a long lasting lipstick and decided to try this one out.  </li>
<li> But I know it does last long.  </li>
<li> I let it dry a short time then ate lunch and poof</li>
<li> coz I never have to wear it that long.  </li>
<li> And it stays in place for a long time.</li>
<li> I would recommend it to other women who are looking for a long lasting lipstick at an affordable price.</li>
<li> this lipstick is so dry.</li>
<li> I think some people are saying its dry because they have dry skin, the lipstick is quite balanced...</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money either if you are looking for a long lasting lipstick...</li>
<li> This lipstick goes on very dry.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a very dark red</li>
<li> so you gotta be careful choosing the one that you like.</li>
<li> /&gt;The color doesn&#x27;t last, it was gone within a few hours</li>
<li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is how dry it feels after awhile, but nothing a little lipgloss can&#x27;t fix!</li>
<li> It also didn&#x27;t give my lips that overly dry and cracked appearance that other long wear products have in the past.</li>
<li> I usually get this at my local drugstore but no longer.</li>
<li> On the other hand, it migrated.</li>
<li> I have always wanted a red lipstick that doesn&#x27;t get messy and go all over the place, and this is it!</li>
<li> Usually my lipstick doesn&#x27;t last over an hour.</li>
<li> I would say, and my take is, if you have dry skin put a little bit of lip balm before.</li>
<li> Not worth your money.</li>
<li> It was not smooth and looked very thick and heavy.  </li>
<li> seriously...</li>
<li> It was so frustrating.  </li>
<li> One must remember that it is difficult to judge the color when ordering.</li>
<li> I wondered if I was doing something wrong, but there were no instructions.</li>
<li> I like the color so bad.</li>

    <li> Before I was using Revlon red lipstick...I LOVED the color and how it felt on my lips, but it seriously wouldn&#x27;t last longer than 45 minutes.  It was so frustrating.  So I went on the hunt for a long lasting lipstick and decided to try this one out.  I haven&#x27;t tested to see if it&#x27;d last 14 hours...I doubt it would, but it certainly does last hours on end.  And this color, continuous cranberry, is the perfect rich shade of red for me.  Oh, and not to mention how GOOD it smells!  It&#x27;s so fruity and pleasant.  All in all, I really like this 14 hour lip color.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lipstick. I usually get this at my local drugstore but no longer. Will now order through Amazon . Color is accurate and was delivered in perfect condition. Can&#x27;t ask for more ! This lipstick will last longer if you let it dry on your lips first before applying a gloss or having a sip of liquid but I find it doesn&#x27;t really last 14 hours but I am fine with that. Still a great lipstick. It will though last for many hours.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a nice vibrant red that&#x27;ll stay on this is the lipstick for you!</li>
    <li> The color is nice, the delivery was fast though they did take up a giant box for just one stick.....&lt;br /&gt;The color doesn&#x27;t last, it was gone within a few hours and I mean like within 3 hours and fades easily as well transfers just as must as any other lipstick.</li>
    <li> I really love the color of Continuous Cranberry. It&#x27;s a beautiful perfect red shade.  It was not transfer resistent, however.  On one hand, it was good because you could press your lips together to smooth out any uneven patches. On the other hand, it migrated.</li>
    <li> Old and does not go on well.</li>
    <li> this did not deliver on its promise 14 hr superstay it&#x27;s not.this got on everything that i put my mouth on.it wore off on my first meal a few hour later after putting on.this is just a basic lipstick.</li>
    <li> Ok...I see some mixed reviews in here, but when it comes to lipstick, we have to remember that its very personal...and not everyone like all the stuff. I am a make up artist by hobby, and i use a lot of brands, the reason I bought this is because I saw that these lipsticks were very pigmented, and smells not only good but really delicious, its a fruity smell that I just love. The colour is quite pigmented, very good for drug-store brand, and it is like a ruby colour, its matt, but has a subtle sheen to it, which I do not like...again its personal...some of you might like it. I think some people are saying its dry because they have dry skin, the lipstick is quite balanced...I would say, and my take is, if you have dry skin put a little bit of lip balm before. In order to get the best pigmented effect, my secret is, I layer it, first, i put some lip liner, on full lips, then i apply this, lastly I reapply again, then it stays for hours....seriously...if you know the tecnique...you get the best results. This lipstick is worth buying, for sure, I am going to buy my 3rd one from this collection.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, it last very well, its kind of matte finish but soft at the same time, I really like it because I&#x27;m not a glossy person. I don&#x27;t give them the five stars because its darker than the picture so you gotta be careful choosing the one that you like.</li>
    <li> This colour is amazing. The lipstick overall is by far one of my faves. It holds it&#x27;s moisture, Once again the colour! OMG! Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a red lipstick that doesn&#x27;t get messy and go all over the place, and this is it! It&#x27;s a very dark red, it&#x27;s a GORGEOUS color. It smells AMAZING! And it stays in place for a long time. Usually my lipstick doesn&#x27;t last over an hour. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is how dry it feels after awhile, but nothing a little lipgloss can&#x27;t fix! (: I love this product.</li>
    <li> NEVER AGAIN WOULD I PURCHASE THIS .... IT IS VERY STICKY AND LOOKS LIKE POO ON.  NEVER AGAIN.  STICK TO WHATEVER IT IS YOU&#x27;VE USED FOR AGES.  BETTER IDEA TO DO SO.</li>
    <li> I read some other reviews and apparently the 14 hour lipstick stays on for a few people, but came off for many more. That&#x27;s a mystery. I let it dry a short time then ate lunch and poof it was faded to almost nothing. I tried it again later and it came off again. I wondered if I was doing something wrong, but there were no instructions. If you don&#x27;t want to take the chance, consider not buying in the first place.</li>
    <li> Maybe if you didn&#x27;t eat, drink or move your face at all this might last 14 hours. I will say, that it lasts considerably longer than a normal lipstick. It also didn&#x27;t give my lips that overly dry and cracked appearance that other long wear products have in the past. I really did think the colour was true to what it was supposed to be and it had a nice satin feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was impressed with this. I would recommend it to other women who are looking for a long lasting lipstick at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> this lipstick is so dry.</li>
    <li> This actually works better than MAC Ruby Woo.  I like the color so bad. It is dark and bold enough to make you look classy but not old. The texture is so smooth on the lips compared to Mac which is so dry though it&#x27;s matte.  I don&#x27;t care if it lasts 14 hours coz I never have to wear it that long.  But I know it does last long.  When I cleaned it off with tissue,  it didn&#x27;t come off much. Love Love it. Hight recommend it to shoppers who want amazing red classy look with affordable price.</li>
    <li> 14 hour? It doesn&#x27;t even last a dang hour!!!!! Will never buy again! Don&#x27;t waste your money either if you are looking for a long lasting lipstick...this isn&#x27;t it!!!!</li>
    <li> The color of this lipstick is positively drop-dead-gorgeous!  I bought this as a birthday present to myself, hoping that a bright color would perk up my appearance.  WOW!  I doubt that this lipstick would have 14-hr staying power all by itself, however.  I used Lipchic over it (to increase staying power) and found the result to be fantastic.  After 4 hrs of coffee drinking, luncheon, and many kissy/huggy greetings, there had been NO TRANSFER...and I&#x27;d been amazed that no touch-up was necessary, at that point.  By 6 hrs, some color fading had become obvious to me--still very nice, however.</li>
    <li> Perfect craberry red,  gorgeous.  None of these last as long as they say,  but i do like it.  Non drying,  creamy,  and great color!</li>
    <li> Continuos Cranberry is totally a different color. I was expecting something similar to the image, but it wasn&#x27;t. It was more like a dark wine!</li>
    <li> I went to work with this on, doesn&#x27;t work with my skin tone</li>
    <li> This lipstick goes on very dry.  I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Bought one for my wife. Lipstick alignment is off with the casing. Seems to be defective pieces. Also was not in any kind of plastic wrap or packaging material.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  The color was great, it does wear longer than most lipstick.  The price was reasonable, I would order it again.  One must remember that it is difficult to judge the color when ordering. The only problem is that the color will continue to transfer to whatever surface it comes in contact with.  Not the end of the world, the color will stay on the lips as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother, and she absolutely loved the color, texture and quality of this product.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Great color!  Love how it looks on me, but it does NOT stay on at all.  The second you drink anything or eat something, you are reapplying.  I bought lipstain and it has worked significantly better for me.  Not worth your money.</li>
    <li> not the right color for me - way too red. I should of just went to a store and got something like this - this way I can see the color before I purchase. no worries, it so cheap, I just kept it.</li>
    <li> i wanted a nice red, this was it</li>
    <li> Color was too bright for me but that is what I get for trying to order lipstick online. Not the lipsticks fault. I did not care for the texture and feel of this product. It was not smooth and looked very thick and heavy.  Even if I had liked the color, I did not like this lipstick.</li>
