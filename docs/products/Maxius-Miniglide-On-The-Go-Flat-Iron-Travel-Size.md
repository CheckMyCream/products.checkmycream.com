      <li>Its ok if you never used the original one.</li>
      <li>This things gets really hot and is great for a quick straightening and because it is so narrow it is perfect for getting to those spots where your hair is a bit shorter.</li>

      <li>Small sections are best...  </li>
      <li>So when I saw the mini I thought it would be perfect for those small touch ups or stubborn ends as needed.</li>
      <li>Love this sooo much!</li>
      <li>I love love love these flat irons</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have short hair and find this iron holds the hair in place and allows you to style your hair.  With other irons you are having to make allowances for the hair sliding out.  I had told my sister about the iron and she tried mine and immediately she loved it.  She also has short hair, that is white and unruley, now she rule it.  We are both styling with our irons.</li>
    <li> Excellent for straightening bangs on curly hair. I also use it after flat ironing my long hair for the ends to curl a bit in so my hair does not look like a broom. Wish the still made the bigger maxius as the comb part helps immensly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect this Miniglide thing to straight your hair because it wont ( unless my Miniglide is defective ) the heat is not enough to make ( at least medium long hair ) hair straight. BUT - is awesome for hair edges!  that&#x27;s the only good use i could find for my curly hair...Since I&#x27;m going to use it just for that I think is a waste of money or at least it should be cheaper. I bought the Remington wet to dry and it does a nice job - BUT stay away from smashing hot potatoes with you&#x27;re \\&quot;just flat ironed hair\\&quot; because the steam will screw up your hair. Hope this helps!! oh also, the plastic of the Miniglide is super cheap and the cable makes a total mess if you try use the \\&quot;curl iron\\&quot; feature it has ( which by the way doesn&#x27;t work at all!)</li>
    <li> Product works well and arrived in time for gift giving at Christmas, which was sooner than expected!  Great customer service.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Love it...heats good, straightens hair good!!!</li>
    <li> I love this item!!!  This works better than traditional flat irons.  I have used other flat irons with little satisfaction - none worked as well as I thought they would. I love the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; to help pull hair as you straighten it.  Good size and easy to handle.  No way to set temperature but it is hot.  Outside of iron is cool to the touch.</li>
    <li> This little iron is perfect for straightening around my edges. It&#x27;s not as good for the whole head of hair, it&#x27;s much too small for that. But, I can get really close to the root without burning my scalp. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a strong supporter of the original maxi glide. I have used it for years. I recommended it to everyone. So when I saw the mini I thought it would be perfect for those small touch ups or stubborn ends as needed. Well I&#x27;m not impressed but not totally disappointed. The original still helps for touch ups moreso. I think if the mini was a little wider it would help a lot. Just my opinion. I will always replace my original if burns out or gets lost. I might not replace the mini.</li>
    <li> I kept seeing infocommercials about this product and I finally decided to give it a try after the relaxers I had been using over the years started taken my hair out.  I guess my hair has become too sensitive to the chemicals after all this time of using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I ordered this product and read the instructions; then I went online and watched a video posted by someone else who used this product and how she used it and the tips she gave, especially since people had complained about it pulling your hair out.  After reading all I could at the Maxius glide site and watching videos, I was ready to try it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS WONDERFUL!! I was surprised at the short amount of time it took to do my hair and it did not take as much distilled water as I thought.  I distilled my own water after researching it and found I could do it at home but it took a long time to get what I thought was enough to put in the Maxius glide.  I had quite a bit left over after during my hair.  Next time, I will just use bottled water, which is another recommendation. As they suggest not to use plain water from faucet.  I highly recommend this product to any woman and especially black women who do not want to use chemicals any more.  Thank God I can get my hair healthy again!! Thanks, Mrs. Hayes</li>
    <li> i was expecting this to be amazing.  wrong.  doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all.  barely any heat  no power button, only goes on by plugging it in.  makes my hair knotty.  this product sucks.  i want my money back.</li>
    <li> I have the bigger maxiglide and wish I could&#x27;ve got bigger one. Its ok if you never used the original one. Lots bigger</li>
    <li> This is perfect for travel or for short hair like mine. I am a guy so this is perfect and you cant beat the price! Unfortunately you don&#x27;t have any heat control options, you just plug it in and go but it gets completely hot in about 30 seconds so that makes up for it &#x3D;] This straightener works best if you take small clumps of hair and nothing more. I really recommend this for any guys out there who straiten their hair like me.</li>
    <li> I USED THIS AND IT STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR AND MADE MY HAIR SOFT , SHINEY,, AND SOFT, THANKS I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> i really needed help getting my hair straightened and this product continues to provide that good help.thank you for the good sale.</li>
    <li> I originally had the Maxius old style steam straightener, which I LOVED....So I figured I would try this one because it was cheap and guess what!! you get what you pay for.  This does not get to a high enough temp to be effective.</li>
    <li> As described. And powerful.</li>
    <li> I love my MAXI GLIDE!!  It is small and compact and it heats up very quickly.  I currently have my hair in it&#x27;s natural state and this really helped straighten out my hair after washing and drying (this is the mini one so it took a while to straighten my whole head, I did it section by section piece by piece but it got done lol). I also had a nice sheen to my hair and my hair was bouncy :) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using everyday as that can damage your hair and thin it out but it&#x27;s great for occasional use and it&#x27;s excellent for those roots that you want to straighten out and you don&#x27;t need to clamp it so tightly to get it straight you just glide it right through your hair and it straightens very nicely. My mom asked me if I relaxed my hair when she saw how it looked so you know it&#x27;s good! I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!!  Get the mini and the regular size, it&#x27;s well worth the money, I&#x27;m going to order the regular maxi glide ASAP!!</li>
    <li> I used to have the full maxiglide but since cutting my hair I wanted a smaller. The only thing is there isn&#x27;t a temp. control so use protectant when using on your hair.</li>
    <li> I love it, but I do have one problem with it and that&#x27;s clean up. Obviously you use it to brush your hair while flat-ironing it.  However, it&#x27;s annoying to use an old tooth-brush to remove the hair.    Let me clarify.  I buy a new toothbrush every 90 days just like everybody else.  After 90 days instead of throwing away my old tooth brush.  I use my old tooth bruth to remove hair from my flat iron.  and I have to do it all the time.  It&#x27;s really annoying do that all of time.  and honestly, I would rather put a mountain full of protection on my head and use a regular flat iron.  But yeah. It works wonders. It&#x27;s just annoying to use a tooth brush to remove the hair stuck on it. and YES, there is a burnt hair smell because hair gets stuck on it.    It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all if you don&#x27;t press down on it.  But naturally hair WILL be removed since it&#x27;s like a comb/brush; therefore, there IS a burnt hair smell.  and if it&#x27;s only that, that bothers you, then save your money and just use protection every time.  Unlike what the commercial says.  The burnt hair smell has NOTHING to do with the flat iron.  It has EVERYTHING to do with hair protection sprays.</li>
    <li> I love my mini iron. It works great! Would highly recommend.purchasing if you are a traveler. It also works just as great as the full size Maxi Glide.</li>
    <li> I should have purchased this flat iron from Maxius.  Paid more to a middle man.  :-(</li>
    <li> came home from school and found my order on the table , so you know what i did rush to the bathroom to try it lol i just tested the little spot of hair in the front and as far as i know its pretty good for my african american relaxed hair it helps my roots get straighten even gloss it a bit , the only thing that grind my gears about it is the brush part cause itfeels a bit rough but ima have to hold it more firmly so we shall see how this goes :)</li>
    <li> This iron gets too hot and has no way to control temperature. That makes it nearly impossible to use close to the hairline. It actually burnt my hair. So, I never used it again. Maybe okay for some, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Not  so good for natural 4b/4c hair the tooth pull the hair but doesn&#x27;t really straighten</li>
    <li> I would suggest to anyone wanting to keep their hair from using this device! I only use it for my edges as it is not good for much else. My hair kept getting tangled and pulled out by it!</li>
    <li> This miniglide does not glide, at all.  Would not recommend for textured, coarse, curly or kinky hair.  It is very difficult to pull through the hair, even after prior straightening.  Could not be used as a flat iron or a curling iron.  Hair gets stuck and you end of tugging at your hair and damaging it.</li>
    <li> Great straightner! The only downside is that I didnt notice you couldn&#x27;t adjust the heat setting when I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I love love love these flat irons so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have a short hair cut and these flat irons gets every little thing.</li>
    <li> I got this iron for my tough goatee hair! It straightens without pulling and it works well on my girlfriend&#x27;s bangs as well and she has thick hair!</li>
    <li> The best flat iron out there if you have thick hair round side it will press well, and you will love it.</li>
    <li> I have coarse 4C hair with split ends but this iron makes it smooth while keeping my natural body and thickness. The detangling pins really do help me see how it works. The iron gets hot but my hair feels warm or almost cool to the touch. I would recommend this to all hair types except really long hair because it would take longer to style.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener for kinky hair. It heats up well and straightens completely. Shipping was fast and I only wish they had the larger one but this is one is great!</li>
    <li> I ordered this a few weeks ago, and I LOVE IT!  Best purchase in hair care I have made in a long time!  It does EXACTLY what it claims to do in the infomercial!  I have relaxed, African-American hair, and this straightened my   coarse new growth beautifully without much effort!  My Maxiglide XP is on the way! I can&#x27;t wait!  Some tips:  Blow dry your hair first...  Small sections are best...  Don&#x27;t squeeze it closed...  Glide through your hair from root to ends smoothly,  don&#x27;t hold it in one place too long!  It gets hot, but the bumper edges prevent you from burning  yourself unless you are just being careless...  There is NO temperature gauge, but I still love it...  Did NOT snag my hair at all!  Put some heat protectant on your hair before use, but that&#x27;s your choice...  This is not for all over use because its thin, so it will take longer, but  I did use it all over my head because I don&#x27;t have the large Maxiglide yet...  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I am an African-American female and I do not recommend anyone using this. There is no heat seating so you have to get to working once it is plug in. The teeth will pull your hair out whether you use it properly or not. It also cause damage.My hair was long but it is not so long anymore. I did like the fact it will straighten baby hair. I think it work best if you have straight hair.</li>
    <li> I have short, straight, fine hair. I use a half inch curling iron - but this is so much better. This is my third Maxius Miniglide. I have tried other more expensive flat irons - but this is the one I come back to. The teeth make it wonderful for gripping my fine hair. The heat gives my hair body that lasts all day. My current Maxius is still going strong. I ordered this one as a future replacement because I live in fear that it won&#x27;t be available! I can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
    <li> I must say that I love this flat iron so much that I will have to purchase another one as a spare. I have extremely Kinky African American Hair that is natural. I apply a heat protector, a humidity serum, and dudley&#x27;s press creme and use the maxius on the go flat iron from root to end and my hair results in a relaxer straight look that last for 2 weeks without exercising and 1 week exercising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: cleaning product build up from between the teeth and some hair shedding sticking to the teeth when flat ironing hair. Please do not be alarmed by the hair shedding your hair will not come out in clumps it is happens when pulling the hair straight. I would also suggest investing in a flat ironing cleaner to remove product build up.</li>
    <li> This product my mom had for ten years and it broke, for the price, ten years of performing without breaking, wow! Great bargain.</li>
    <li> It works nicely... it straighten the hair w/little effort .....and delivered with in the time promised</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have very curly hair and can not get it straight with a regular flat plate. This does the job,  and does it well. Only issue is there is no temperature control. May get too hot for those with thin hair.</li>
    <li> I am pleased!  The Maxius  Miniglide works as advertised.  I use it on the hair on the crown of my head.  My hair is so silky after using this product.</li>
    <li> My maxiglide that I had for around 5 years or so finally broke. I did not want to spend a ton of money on a replacement just yet so I found this. It does take just a tad longer to straighten my hair, but I love it. Its compact, and heats up quickly. I do wish it had a temperature gauge however, but for what I paid, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron...It does everything that I have researched on...If you have curly, thick, wavy (anything but straight) and want to have straight hair without it being stiff and hard like most flat irons use this...I highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Gets your hair bone straight so fast. Great for edges. Love it.</li>
    <li> safe and fast, for kids, touch-ups and hard to get short hair around the edges. My girls and I love it.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this flat iron. The first one I had lasted for years. When it died, I figured I had nothing to lose in looking for an identical replacement. I almost fell to the floor when I found it! So, so happy now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the larger maxiglide straightener before, and expected the smaller one to be a good product. However, it does not straighten like other maxiglide products. It left my hair frizzy and less straight than when I started using it. It gets way too hot, with no dial to change the heat setting. Then, when I tried to return the item for a refund, head2toe seller would not take it back since it was used, even though it does not work properly. Do not buy this product, and certainly do not buy from this seller. You WILL be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Had the larger model years ago. Bought it twice and they both crapped out within a year. Specifically bought this version for my short fringe. Works wonderfully on my unruly cow lick. Don&#x27;t try flat ironing your whole head because that would be tedious and not worth your while. But if you have some fringe that needs taming then this is for you.</li>
    <li> Would luv for this tool to have a flat iron built in this size two in one. ? Does that make sense&amp;#34;  otherwise luv it 2nd time ordering on line , soo far soo good ~ thank you ;;</li>
    <li> below expectations, it more like a curling iron.</li>
    <li> Used to have this product and it was perfect! Loaned it to my mom and never saw it again. Was very happy to find it on amazon so reasonably priced! My only complaint is that the product description says that it comes with Maxi clips and carrying case. These items, however, weren&#x27;t included. The product itself deserves every star possible... Would like to be able to say the same about the seller</li>
    <li> Love this sooo much! It&#x27;s perfect for women of color to straighten out those edges! Heats up quickly only has one temp but works great! I would have given it 7stars if i could!</li>
    <li> I ordered my Maxiglide &amp; Mini in a set from the manufactrers website but I love the product and result so much I had to let my fellow Amazon shoppers know that this product is very much worth every penny spent&lt;br /&gt;It straightens and style without leaving a burnt smell, left my hair soft and manageable. They say close gently not tightly which is a little tricky at first to get the pressure right but once yo find the right amount of hair to section off it&#x27;s really easy. My hair is in a recovery stage from being bleached, colored blue, and chemically relaxed which left my hair dry and brittle... Maxiglide has my hair feeling soft a luxurious after less than an hour! I don&#x27;t think I will ever find a better product. Check out their other products too like the Maxiglide Xpress with SteamBurst, The End, and Beyond Straight.</li>
    <li> I have already purchased 2 of these. It thin, heats up fast and straightens really well. Like the little gripper teeth it has.</li>
    <li> Maxius on The Go Flat iron. I like it because it fit even in the smallest purse. It works good for my hair edges. The price is good too</li>
    <li> This product is great for those with relatively straight hair. If you are fully natural or transitioning I would NOT suggest using his product. The teeth in the flat iron pull your hair out and cause damage. There also is no place to adjust the heat setting, you plug it in and begin working. I am waiting for the larger version that uses steam to come back on the market but I will not be using this product any longer.</li>
    <li> Full size maxiglide is a wonderful product; this miniglide is terrible; very cheap product; lot of money for an inferior straightener.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it and I would not recommend it. It pulled out my hair and it didn&#x27;t really work on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have bought I need one everywhere I go. i am natural so this device is perfect for my blowouts when the root doesn&#x27;t get as straight as I want it</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;small size for travel&lt;br /&gt;teeth that grip and smooth hair&lt;br /&gt;does a good job on bangs&lt;br /&gt;light goes on when it&#x27;s plugged in&lt;br /&gt;heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;No on/off switch&lt;br /&gt;No way to close it for storage and travel&lt;br /&gt;too small for a full head of thick hair</li>
    <li> its okay but not as i thought it would be. it makes my daughters hair straighten better then mine. but it does give nice curls to the hair.</li>
    <li> pros: price ($40), gets hot, small, lightweight, excellent design (teeth work extremely well to straighten hair)&lt;br /&gt;cons: no temperature control, great for roots but not necessarily overall styling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have AA relaxed hair.  will use this to extend the life of my relaxer.  i also have a jibere root straightener and a generic 5/8-in flat iron.  this item takes the cake!  does an excellent job at straightening the root all the way to the tip of the hair, but when i use this, my hair is so straight on the ends that i feel like i need to use a &#x27;regular&#x27; flat iron just to give it a little boost.  i bought this based on the recommendation of a friend who has natural hair and uses the maxiglide.  i borrowed her maxiglide once and loved the results.  since then, i&#x27;ve cut and relaxed my hair, but this miniglide is great.  i would recommend this and buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hats off to the company who shipped this product!  it arrived sooner than expected (1 day instead of 2) and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> Two thin not hot enough</li>
    <li> I love and it work well for me and my daughter I will people to get. My daughter in law told about and I will tell my friends to buy. It do not take out my hair and it work good on my daughter.</li>
    <li> Great for the hairline !!</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair &amp; this works great with my roots.. I plan on getting the larger one..</li>
    <li> Maxiglide are the only flat irons I use. If used correctly they will not pull your hair out! Go to the maxius website for instructions. Perfect for transitioning from relaxed to natural. Just as great for reducing the number of times to relax. I get way more time put of my relaxer.</li>
    <li> This is great for when I just need to straighten those spots above my ears at my hairline.  I&#x27;ve used it once so far. I love the way the combs fit into the opposite plate.  I have the original, regular sized Maxiglide, and I haven&#x27;t found another straightening device like it.  I plan on using this for travel, and perhaps on a regular basis, so I hope it lasts!</li>
    <li> to small and pulls my hair</li>
    <li> Used this on my bikini area, worked perfectly!!</li>
    <li> this is a great little tool....especially if you have short-mid length hair...works really well</li>
    <li> This is perfect for traveling. I have taken this with my on my trips. I hate lugging around m big flat iron. This things gets really hot and is great for a quick straightening and because it is so narrow it is perfect for getting to those spots where your hair is a bit shorter. It may be small but does the job of a large flat iron.</li>
    <li> Very hot burned my hair</li>
    <li> If you buy this product you will be pleased even on the most coarse hair its a good product i will in fact i have recommend it to friends family whom ever ask me do i perm my hair i say no it&#x27;s the maxi that made this possible</li>
    <li> Great for straightening edges. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair. My hair line around  my temples and the nape of my neck is all baby hair that is way way shorter than the rest of my hair. Although its curly it is very fine hair unlike the rest of my hair which is thick. I am afraid to use a regular flat iron on the fine hair because I don&#x27;t want to burn/damage it.This iron IS A DREAM COME TRUE. There is nothing else like it. It grabs the fine hair and combs right through it and straightens and smooths it with out damaging it. It worked amazingly when I had bangs too. It also works awesome on my niece&#x27;s hair who has VERY course curly hair especially close to the scalp where she can&#x27;t get the bigger flat iron close enough. I have used it for years and will continue to use it as long as I have hair! LOL. Best &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; product ever!</li>
    <li> It sucks all it did is pull out my hair and burn it. Not a good product. This is not a good product i advise nobody to buy this straighter. It does not work any hair type. It just burns your out.</li>
