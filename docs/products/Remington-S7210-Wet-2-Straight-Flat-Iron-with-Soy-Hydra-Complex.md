      <li>Buyers beware  easy to return through amazon though</li>
      <li>To be honest, I have had better straighteners since this one leaves my hair still frizzy, but I give it 4 stars because it really does the job well with drying your hair.</li>

      <li>The controls are easy to see and use.</li>
      <li>and it is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>Is good for its price but not if you are looking for a high quality one</li>
      <li>so this is really nice, and I would compare it (as the stylist did) to a higher priced unit.  </li>
      <li>sometimes my fine hair falls through.</li>
      <li>I do have fairly fine hair that is just a bit fluffier and wavier than I&#x27;d like when I don&#x27;t straighten it, so</li>
      <li>It would probably be fine for someone with thicker hair.</li>
      <li>DOES NOT HEAT UP TO QUICK!</li>
      <li>To top it off it&#x27;s not expensive!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Its great. It got to my house sooner than I thought and now my unruly hair is tame once again! Would recommend for people even with thick hair!</li>
    <li> My only real gripe about this is that it doesn&#x27;t clamp down all the way on fine hair.  I owned an oder model of this flat iron for years and loved it, but it was worn out.  So I bought this as a replacement.  It heats up fast and my hair feels very soft (which may be due to the TRESemme Thermal Creations I bought with this), but it&#x27;s difficult to straighten with the plates not meeting all the way on my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and a curl and It works really well whith my hair dry, when i use it to dry my hair i feel like ia too much damage. But I like it.</li>
    <li> I picked this up to replace a previous wet to straight flat iron: Remington S7100a 1-inch. I had loved my previous one and wanted something which was similar. First, I have long, wavy, fine hair. I wanted something that did a decent job or straightening without damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this and immediately noticed that the air vents for the steam released from wet hair are right where your hand is supposed to hold. This was especially true if you use the finger grooves at the end of the wand to hold it shut, which I needed to do since the straightener often did not close all the way.&lt;br /&gt;I use this primarily for my bangs, however I noticed that the iron plates are exposed even when the flat iron is clamped on your hair. This means that I often burnt my forehead trying to get the part of my bangs closest to my scalp. I never had this issue with my previous wand because the iron plates are protected with a layer of plastic so that they are not exposed when the iron is clamped.&lt;br /&gt;I also really appreciated the locking feature of my previous one, which allowed the iron to be locked into the closed position. This made it easier to store and it made sure it was out of the way with the plates unexposed while it was heating up.&lt;br /&gt;I think it was worth the money to do the more expensive version because this straightener is definitely what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; function works well enough, but the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; function takes quite a bit longer to get the same results.  I thought this would remove a step in my morning routine by eliminating the hair dryer, but this really does work better (and much faster) on dry hair.</li>
    <li> Still experimenting with it. I do not love it, I do not hate it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really as thrilled with this item as I thought I would be.</li>
    <li> Its perfect and so functional</li>
    <li> not good, frizz my hair doesn&#x27;t straight well</li>
    <li> Love this straighter. I can straighten my hair in like 20 minutes with this product. I have long hair... my hair is more then half way on my back.It dose not matter if your hair is semi wet or totally wet it will get the job done. One thing is that if you hair is wet and you straighten it, it might me a little dry and  could get frizzy so just use hair oil to get it nice and soft. If you use it on dry hair you don&#x27;t have to use oil it will be soft.</li>
    <li> I recommend the HSI Professional Hair straightener instead (Amazon also sells it.) For $20 more, you get a hair iron that is sturdy and has great plates. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to close correctly so the plates are slightly misaligned, making curling the ends of my hair difficult. I wish I had not purchased this product. Also, the wet 2 dry functionality doesn&#x27;t really work that well either.</li>
    <li> I already owned a Remington &amp;#34;Wet 2 Straight&amp;#34; 2 inch for over 6 years and love it. I recently got a very short haircut and thought the new 1 inch version would make it easier for straightening my hair. The plates of this iron don&#x27;t touch, so makes it difficult to use. Leaves my hair frizzy and with static. Also I have burned my scalp a couple of times. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product, so I&#x27;ll keep using my old flat iron.</li>
    <li> The flat iron works great and I got it for $10 less than the department store! The price dropped while I was in the \\&quot;consideration\\&quot; phase of my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great price - great product</li>
    <li> It is cheap and works well for me. It gives good results when I dry my hair with a towel first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good, non-expensive flat iron for a while. This was not a disappointment! I&#x27;m glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> I recommend, excellent product very good quality</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this flat iron because it was inexpensive, I am happy that I got it because it is easy to handle and works great.  This is a Good buy!</li>
    <li> my wife has been looking for a hair straightener that wet to dry that her hair actually straightens in, all the other companies and one we have tried eitherburn up in a few weeks or wont straighten my wifes hair, this product had no problem taming my wifes extremely thick and wild hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for really curly and thick hair like mine because it goes up to really high temps</li>
    <li> The product is perfect. I&#x27;ve been using it since I got it and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;Happy client</li>
    <li> excellent and good product</li>
    <li> The product seems to be good, but the one I received has a problem which is the main purpose of the tool: the flat iron doesn&#x27;t close completely to straight the hair properly. I am going to return the item.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works so good on my hair. Easy to use, and such a great buy! Not pricey like some, but all of the quality and high heat. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product dries your hair really well, but even with protective sprays feels like it&#x27;s burning the crap out of it! My hair looks noticeably damaged after only a couple times using it.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to keep your fingers clear of steam as well</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with this straightener. I have used it on slightly damp and very damp hair, works best on the slightly damp hair. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it really saves time as it takes several passes over damp hair to get it dry, but it is nice that I don&#x27;t have to wait for my hair to air dry, or whip out the blow dryer to get ready now. I might try using the blow dryer on my roots, though, as it still leaves them a little wet and it&#x27;s difficult to achieve that bit of volume at the roots that I like to get from the blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat this one. It does an excellent job, gets my hair pin straight and shiny, and the style seems to last until I wash it again. I should note that it has been cold in Florida this week (low humidity) so I&#x27;m curious to see how my style fares in the humidity once the state warms up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly (maybe a minute or two) and the adjustable dial is convenient. I tried curling a couple of chunks of hair with it out of curiosity, it worked and only took a few seconds to get a slight curl/wave to the strands or a curl at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very long and naturally wavy in spots (very poofy without product... think Hermione Granger from the first HP movie,) also it is relatively thin. I am not sure how well this would work on thick or curly hair, so I cannot speak to that.... but for me, this straightener is a great purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought and returned 3 different flat irons before I bought this one and fell in love.  I wasn&#x27;t able to get the silky straightness with the other irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally straight with a very slight wave.  I like to straighten it out completely.  With this iron, I can either straighten my wet hair or more often I blow dry and then straighten.  It straightens without pulling and leaves my hair smooth, shiny and frizz free.  My hair is super soft and gorgeous after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year so far and it is still going strong.  It heats up fast, which makes my morning routine super fast.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I have very dry hair that is unmanageable. The first time I used this straightener it definitely held up in the humid Florida weather that I am in and felt very soft. I did use a blow dryer for a few minutes just to set the style with heat but you can&#x27;t go wrong using this product!</li>
    <li> I returned this item.  Weird burnt smell when using. I would not recommend this straight flat iron. Buyers beware  easy to return through amazon though</li>
    <li> My daughter straightens her hair often (too often) and her ends are dry and tend to be frizzy. This straightener made her hair look and feel soft and the frizz is gone. She loves that she doesn&#x27;t have to dry her hair first.</li>
    <li> This is not the best flat iron but it does work. i have used it both on my dry and wet hair and it does not burn my hair. your are able to adjust the heat which is helpful, It is very easy to use. you can&#x27;t really beat the price on it either.</li>
    <li> The thought that a flat iron could dry and straighten hair in one swoop was not even a concept in my head before I got this Wet 2 Straight flat iron by Remington. It works like this: you do a quick towel dry of your hair, divide it into sections, set the iron to one of the wet settings (you can also flat iron dry hair on a different setting), and iron away. There are vents on one side of the iron where the steam escapes as each section is dried. I must warn you that when the wet strands are drying, be careful, the hair and the steam are very hot. The unit heats up quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been able to get my hair as smooth as I have been able to get it with this Remington flat iron. That said, when I&#x27;ve tried it on my wet hair, I wasn&#x27;t able to get it completely dry - there was a slight level of dampness but it was silky smooth nonetheless. I just stayed indoors until it was bone dry. I&#x27;ve tried it on semi-dry hair (meaning I did a few minutes with a hair dryer before flat ironing) with a beautiful result. And there was virtually no dampness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the Soy Hydra Complex, I&#x27;m still not sure what that is exactly or what it does, specifically. I don&#x27;t feel anything on either of the ceramic plates. All I can say is this is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I have an expensive Chi and this really worked a lot better. And for under $30! A real keeper.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this product. Then I tried it. It did not do what it claimed unfortunately and I had to return it.</li>
    <li> i received mine two days after purchasing i tested it out soon after i received it. it heats up fast and works well it makes a sizzling sound when you use it on wet hair but that is okay. i totally say buy it this product. would buy again.</li>
    <li> First of all, I bought this at Target locally and paid $22.99.  I have very curly kinky hair and my Chi flat iron has been my faithful &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for years.  However, the idea of straightening my hair when damp or even wet was and still is a very appealing idea.  This product, however, falls very short of it&#x27;s claims for me. One of the biggest issues is that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any pressure at all between the plates.  Once I got my section of hair between them,  it literally falls through. No amount of squeezing the handle will clamp onto the hair. After about a dozen or so passes through, my hair had dried, but gosh was it frizzy. I could get this result with with a couple of passes of my blow dryer at a MUCH lower temperature!  I ended up finishing my hair with the Chi and as usual, was delightfully pleased with the smooth glossy look of my hair.  I wish Chi would do this technology. It&#x27;s sounds wonderful in theory.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this thing at all. It grabs hairs and breaks them and it emits a strange smell. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this - if you want straight sleek hair, dry your hair with a blow dryer and use a regular high quality flat iron.</li>
    <li> This broke within a month of using. Idk if it was just mine or what but it doesnt stay on.. I have to kerp checking it the light is on and working. Not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my second Remington Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron, the first one I bought was from Target for $26. Once it heated up the plates warped to where half of it didn&#x27;t close enough to grasp my hair. The half that did close enough worked great on my hair, I have fine straight-ish hair so I don&#x27;t need it to do a whole lot. I decided to return it and get a new one thinking maybe that one was just defective. I then discovered it was only $16 here on Amazon so I bought it. The new one does the same thing!! I&#x27;m really disappointed because I really like the way the good half of it works on my hair. I thought about returning it but it was only $16 and I&#x27;d rather not deal with the hassle of return shipping and waiting for my money back so I will just use it until I can find something better. Maybe after a while the plates will straighten up? Doubtful..</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had this long but it seems to stay cleaner than others I have had.  Hair spray and gel buildup are always a problem but a bit of alcohol on a cloth seems to be working well.  I like using it with damp hair rather than wet.  Does a nice job.</li>
    <li> The plates don&#x27;t meet well enough to work on fine hair. You could push them together, if you had asbestos fingers. I liked the idea of wet-to-dry, but this won&#x27;t work for me. It would probably be fine for someone with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I only use it to straighten my bangs, but I use it every day. It does not dry out my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an inexpensive but good flat iron for years. I relax my hair but in order to decrease chemical damage I use heat to straighten it once a week. As I&#x27;ve seen on reviews on similar Remington wet 2 straight products...if you are using it on dry hair no matter how thick you think your hair is (and my new growth is extremely kinky/coily) do not use this on a setting higher than 15! That setting gets my new growth and processed hair shiny and very silky. For best results use a deep condition and set your hair with wrap lotion or heat protectant.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied thanks</li>
    <li> I love this straightner! It woks awesome. Has great heat but can be set cooler! Works great on damp hair too!</li>
    <li> hi love this steam flat iron feels great makes the hair look good pencil straight</li>
    <li> Used this for a week and broke.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my significant other after hers broke and she seems to think this one is great.  There are no frills or fancy bells and whistles, but she says it does the job and she has no complaints.</li>
    <li> I put 3 starts because at the beginning it worked so well, but now, 3 months later it has a weird smell. Is good for its price but not if you are looking for a high quality one</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase at such a great price. I have a LOT of hair and blow drying and straightening took forever. This really helps to, if anything, make it look a little better when I&#x27;m short on time. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Remington 2&amp;#34; wet 2 straight flat iron for about two years now. I was buying this one as a supplement and because it&#x27;s a 1&amp;#34;. It heats up well and curls my hair nicely. I would definitely recommend this brand, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever want a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t do what this type does. I have long/thick/wavy hair and this thing really holds up :)</li>
    <li> The ceramic pieces do not meet together well. I burn my finger on a daily basis trying to hold the opposite end closed enough that it strains my hair effectively.</li>
    <li> This straightener works pretty well but beware that it is very skinny.  It takes me a good 10 extra minutes to use this iron as opposed to my old iron that had more girth to it.  This iron would probably be best suited for somebody with short or thin hair.  I don&#x27;t notice a difference with the soy hydra complex.  Overall it is a good value and a good hair straightener.</li>
    <li> as described quick ship</li>
    <li> I hate to straighten my hair. I&#x27;m not one to spend too much time on looks, this works fast on my wavy/curly hair like never before. Light weight, easy to use and has two settings for damp and dry hair. Works better when your hair is damp, which is an added bonus cause you don&#x27;t have to dry your hair first. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am 11 months into transitioning from relaxed to natural hair.  I have what can be characterized as \\&quot;4c\\&quot; African-American hair.  This flat iron just glides through my hair as I am straightening it.  My hair is super kinky with tight coils.  I blow dry before I use this flat iron, but my hair is still wavy with coils before I use this flat iron.  Consequently, the fact that my hair comes out pin straight with about two passes speaks volumes.  Other flat irons kind of snag my hair as I am straightening, but this iron does not.  It leaves my hair so soft and frizz free.  It really feels as if the heat is not as damaging to my hair.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this flat iron, and I hope that Remington will continue to manufacture it.</li>
    <li> My wife has used a few other flat irons, including the salon favorite Chi.  This is a good value for the money; but for her wavy hair, when dry, setting the iron on the maximum recommended setting for dry hair wasn&#x27;t hot enough.  On wet hair, worked great; a big time-saver to cut out having to blow-dry the hair before straightening it.  The controls are easy to use, and the iron is easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this as a replacement for a previous model.  I stayed with the Wet 2 Straight because of the unique venting system for the steam.  I like to dry my hair most of the way and let the straightener do the rest of the work.  This line of straighteners does that.  This particular model straightens my hair and removes the leftover moisture very well, which I am very happy about.  I do have fairly fine hair that is just a bit fluffier and wavier than I&#x27;d like when I don&#x27;t straighten it, so I can&#x27;t speak for people with other hair types.  I wish it didn&#x27;t take so long to heat up to the hottest setting, so I took a star away for that.  Also from time to time my hair gets caught, but I think that happens with every straightener.  Overall, I think it&#x27;s fantastic and would recommend it as an inexpensive straightening option!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works pretty well. I have yet to try it on wet hair but very good on dry.</li>
    <li> I gave this flat iron two tries to do as was described, figuring maybe the first time I just wasn&#x27;t doing something right. I was way less than pleased. I have thick wavy hair but I clip it up in sections so I can straighten in small sections at a time. Normally I use a CHI Air and it takes me about 20-30 minutes, depending on how curly my hair is that day. That leaves my hair smooth, soft, straight, and flat. I wanted this flat iron so on days I didn&#x27;t have time to shower the night before, I could still have time in the morning to shower and do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product however, didn&#x27;t dry my hair pretty much at all. It left it extremely damp. It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all. It left it quite wavy, super frizzy, and really fluffy. If I wanted that, I would just blow dry my hair....&lt;br /&gt;I used a good amount of heat protectant to be on the safe side and this flat iron still left my hair so damaged. This all took me about an hour to get even that result. I went over and over sections of my hair trying to get it to straighten and flatten. It really didn&#x27;t work. This doesn&#x27;t even work on dry hair! This product is such a joke. It&#x27;s absolutely not worth it.</li>
    <li> I personally did not like this straighter because it did not really straighten my hair. I have very frizzy thick hair and it just did not do the best job.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this item I was leery because of the ratings then I read some of them and realized the issues some of the one stars were having. I know the item says wet 2 dry it may have eliminated confusion if the item were named Damp 2 Dry. I loved the results I got from the iron and it lasted all day long. I am very happy with the iron. For some of the other low star ratings my suggestion would be the highest heat to put the iron on is about in the middle range, when too hot a temperature goes onto hair it  can damage the hair and if the iron is mid heat it will still straighten the hair without the extreme damage. Higher does not mean better or faster. I do suggest this iron I love it and keep it on a low to medium heat range and it works just fine on my lightly damp hair with just a little product works wonders and I love it.</li>
    <li> I have really thick and really long hair (of the color described above), and usually wear it naturally wavy or blow dry it out.  Since this promises to cut down the time of styling, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try on towel-dried hair.  Unfortunately, my hair is just way too thick and wavy for this.  By the time you get to the stage of dryness that this item really works, it&#x27;s too curly to do much good.  I honestly don&#x27;t get much use out of straighteners anyway (too much of a hassle once I&#x27;ve already dried it), and the only ones I DO like are the ones with comb attachments (that separate the hair and get through wavy hair more easily).  I gave this to a friend and she had similar complaints (with similar hair) - too long to wait for straight hair.  Keep in mind this is a comparison between blow drying vs straightening with this tool, given that this tool claims to replace blow drying.  I&#x27;ll stick with my trusty [[ASIN:B000ASDGK8 BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme  Dryer]] for now, thanks.</li>
    <li> No need to dry before straightening, this does them both and very quickly! It&#x27;s the perfect size, I would not get the 2&amp;#34; unless I had lots of hair and a lot of experience using a straight iron. It&#x27;s perfect for my 10 yr old&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT HEAT UP TO QUICK!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife because her old one (same brand), after almost 3 years, gave out on her. Now, my wife processes her hair all the time so I picked this one with the soy stuff. She love the thing. Her hair is soft. It heats up quickly and she can totally use it when her hair is wet. Makes getting rwady to go out so much faster. Lol. And again I say, Happy wife, Happy life!</li>
    <li> Works on damp or dry hair. I think saying \\&quot;wet\\&quot; hair in the product subtitle is a little off. If I let my hair air dry a bit and then iron it while it is still damp I get the best results.  It is time consuming with a 1\\&quot; iron and my hair is thick. However, the results last and often I can skip washing the next day and just do a touch up. It&#x27;s a great price point and comparative value to \\&quot;high end\\&quot; irons.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron to try because I was intrigued by the claim of straightening and drying the hair at the same time.....no need for a blow dryer?  And even if it worked correctly, I was not optimistic of it working well on my daughter&#x27;s hair--which is of mixed texture.  I washed and conditioned her hair, and went to work....and it absolutely performed as claimed!!  I don&#x27;t know if it was a timesaver--I needed to go over the hair repeatedly to get it dry--but it did dry the hair, and actually straightened it, like any flat iron would.  I really did not thing that the steam heat would be conducive to straightening my daughter&#x27;s corkscrew curls....but it did the trick!!  I would have given this iron 5 stars, if not for the fact that the plates did not come together as tightly as I would have liked along their length; I had to slide the hair closer to the end to get the tight ironing that I wanted.  Overall, however, a great way to avoid the tortuous process of blowdrying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DYB</li>
    <li> If all you want is to straighten your hair while it&#x27;s damp this is the product for you. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend attempting to straighten while your hair is too wet because even with damp hair I had to make a few passes over each section.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like this straightener because unlike other straighteners (chi) that allow you to easily curl your hair, this one was much more difficult and left my hair frizzy and looking like i slept on it wet. Also when holding the iron, my fingers slip off the grip and onto the steam vents. Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;I give this product a 3 because it does indeed straighten damp hair after a few passes but count off for the number of times I&#x27;ve already burnt myself on that darn vent and the difficulty of curling. I will probably return this iron and look for another that is better for curling.&lt;br /&gt;********UPDATE**********&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve held onto my straightener for a few weeks and decided to upgrade its rating from a 3 to a 4.&lt;br /&gt;I have grown to really love its ability to straighten damp hair, again, not too damp. I&#x27;ve hardly used my hair dryer since I bought this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does not straighten or curl my hair as quickly as other straighteners, probably still about twice the amount of time but once you figure out what it can handle such as how damp, how much hair it can handle at a time, slow down, etc. things get much better.&lt;br /&gt;Only real negative now is that I&#x27;m still burning the heck out of myself on that darn steam vent!</li>
    <li> Whats great about the product is that it heats up really well and real quick. When using it wet it take way too long to get the hair dry even when the hair was partially air dried. Does pull the hair a little more than i would like but for the price i guess its ok.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair. It does take several passes to completely straighten a section. Great for those who don&#x27;t have the time to blow dry and flat iron their hair.</li>
    <li> First off, this straightener saves my hair! My hair nowadays is very wavy and messy due to a bad perm i got 5 months ago. This straightener helps to organize my hair and gives a silky look. I would also recommend to  apply hair moisturizer spray and heat protect before and after the process. For me, it works better on dry hair and i am just glad i bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Just like any other straighteners, it will eventually damage your hair for overuse. I suggest to use it only 1-2 times a week along with hair treatments ( conditioning/ hair mask) to protect your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this flat iron 3 times so far. It works great on dry hair! It heats up and stays hot the entire time unlike my last straightener that constantly was trying to re-heat as I was fixing my hair. My hair is really silky when its done just like advertised. I can&#x27;t decide if I like using it on damp hair, it seems to take a long time. It works, and gets the hair straight, but I think blow drying it and then straightening takes less time....I would suggest it for others regardless.</li>
    <li> Love this for my hair, cheaper than in the department stores and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair whether wet or dry.</li>
    <li> I have been through MANY hair straighteners, all of which either don&#x27;t do the job very well or don&#x27;t do as well for very long. But this hair straightener, without a DOUBT is by far the best. I love that I can get out of the shower, towel my hair dry and then straighten my hair! I can take this anywhere- on vacation especially! And no more sleeping on wet hair to be able to dry it in the morning! I will never buy another hair straightener! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener! My hair has always been frizzy and wavy and it&#x27;s long so it usually took me an hour to style it but with this straightener it takes me 25muns to get it done. To top it off it&#x27;s not expensive! I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this straighter.  It is pretty cool how it can straighten your hair after you got out of the shower.  It is two in one as it not only straighten your hair, but dries it too instead of blow drying it.  To be honest, I have had better straighteners since this one leaves my hair still frizzy, but I give it 4 stars because it really does the job well with drying your hair.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this iron..</li>
    <li> nivce flat iron looks so good and Í am glad i get it very fast thank you for everything .</li>
    <li> I love this straightner. I wanted one that does not have very wide plates so that it is portable. This product has worked amazingly for me. Straightens my hair in seconds and I can carry it in my bag. Heats up so quickly you will be amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it says wet to straight I wouldn&#x27;t use this again on wet hair. I tried it once and it made my hair feel like hay. It should be used only on dry hair</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I first discovered this product. After reading reviews, I ordered one for myself. It worked pretty well when I would use it with wet hair. I thought I was going to keep this flat iron until I tried straightening my hair when it was dry. I only straighten my bangs to get rid of my cowlick, and when trying to do this when my hair was dry, it wouldn&#x27;t do as good of a job as I&#x27;d like. Parts of my hair would be sticking out, and no matter how many times I went over it, it wouldn&#x27;t say down. This would also probably be due to the fact that the plates only touch at the closest ends to your hand. You&#x27;d need to use your other hand on the very end of the flat iron to close the plates completely and get all of your hair in one go. I ended up returning it and getting the Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener instead. I wouldn&#x27;t use that one as a wet to straight flat iron, but it&#x27;s a very good flat iron when your hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron it would leave your hair smelling like the Soy Hydra Complex all day. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it&#x27;s obvious. Just a final thought.</li>
    <li> I burnt my hand when picking up this iron... Not on the heat part, but on the handle where you hold it.  I hope that mine was defective and this is not a design flaw.  Too bad, wet to dry flat irons are an interested idea.</li>
    <li> So far I am thoroughly impressed with this flat iron, primarily for the ability to use it on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use the iron to dry my hair, it takes about as long as flat ironing normally would, but it saves me the step of drying my hair first. I feel like my hair comes out straighter with a lot fewer fly-aways when I use this iron. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m ironing wet hair or if it&#x27;s the aloe in the iron plates, but whatever it is, it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a big fan of the body shape. It fits nicely into my hand and seems to be made of a relatively durable plastic. The temperature dial is placed between the two arms toward the center so that when the iron is clamped shut in my hand, I&#x27;m not accidentally turning the temperature up or down (I always seemed to turn my old iron down during the course of picking up the iron to use it and setting it down to grab another chunk of hair). This is especially important because this iron has two settings and it explicitly warns the user against using the high settings (15+ on the dial) on dry hair. The temperature ranges for wet v. dry hair are indicated by different colored lights on the side, so it&#x27;s easy to know immediately if the iron is accidentally set too high or too low for my hair&#x27;s situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I appreciated was how thoroughly the directions are written. I&#x27;m not very experienced with flat irons, and even if I were this iron is a bit different than others, so it was nice to have clear, straight-forward instructions to get me started (such as where to position the steam vents when ironing wet hair).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m thrilled with the flat iron and how it makes my hair look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that in a couple of the places where it looks like there is a grip for your thumb and index are right in an area where the iron vents steam, if you put your finger there you&#x27;ll get burned. But I learned that pretty quickly didn&#x27;t make the same mistake twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Use on wet hair&lt;br /&gt;Handle Design is comfortable&lt;br /&gt;Control locations are nice&lt;br /&gt;Light are intuitive&lt;br /&gt;Well written instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;A couple of spots that looked like grips were too high up on the iron and could cause you to get steam burns if you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s awesome. Highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Crystal Mathewsce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Use on wet hair&lt;br /&gt;Handle Design is comfortable&lt;br /&gt;Control locations are nice&lt;br /&gt;Light are intuitive&lt;br /&gt;Well written instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;A couple of spots that looked like grips were too high up on the iron and could cause you to get steam burns if you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s awesome. Highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Crystal Mathews</li>
    <li> I tested the straightener out on a section of wet hair and although the packaging says to expect a little bit of sizzle, I just couldn&#x27;t get past the sound and fear that I was ruining my hair by using a hot straightener on wet hair.  I will still continue to use it on dry hair as it works perfectly to straighten dry hair.</li>
    <li> First of all let me just say that this is my first straight iron.  But it was recommended to me by an expensive stylist and I very happy with the product.  My hair goes from towel dry (not dripping) to dry and straight in about 15-20 minutes.  I have very long thick hair so this is really nice, and I would compare it (as the stylist did) to a higher priced unit.  You won&#x27;t regret the results from this one.  The price for what you get is unbelievable (don&#x27;t forget to use heat protectant spray with any flat iron though :).  Happy styling!</li>
    <li> After looking at many flat irons I purchased this from Ulta with the sales girl assuring me it would be good for my hair.  I tried it today with my hair semi-wet, it did sizzle but I figured that was supposed to happen; what wasn&#x27;t supposed to happen was that my hair started breaking off and the ends looking fried.  I have been using flat irons for about 15 years without this ever happening before.  It is going back to the store today.</li>
    <li> I do refer to reviews when choosing a product. The reviews for this iron were straight on. It is relatively easy to use and I am finished very quickly.</li>
    <li> After I used this flat iron once, I stashed my blow dryer in the back of the linen closet. It&#x27;s the perfect solution for winter and summer. The Wet 2 Straight iron does exactly what it says: it dries damp hair while straightening it. It works on barely damp hair just as well as on hair not long out of the shower. The controls are easy to see and use. With the dial turned to one of 30 settings, a light next to the on-off switch shines amber for use on dry hair and green when it reaches a setting hot enough for wet hair.</li>
    <li> is a very good hair iron, heated sufficient to straighten hair. leaves hair very bright.</li>
    <li> I finally got fed up wrestling the Chi straightener away from my daughter and decided to buy a less expensive option for myself, as I do not flat iron my hair all that often. I was intrigued with the wet to straight feature. I have only used it once so far, but I was blown away by the results. I have VERY thick, wavy/curly hair. I let my hair dry half way, used the blow dryer for a minute to two to make it evenly damp all over and straightened it. Wow. It worked every bit as well as the Chi. Maybe even better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: I was skeptical of the reviews that said it made their hair shiny. But it does! Silky would be the word I would use. Crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> the older wet 2 straight model was better. This one does not work properly on wet hair. I really wish I have ordered the old model.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the older version of the wet 2 straight that I&#x27;ve had for about 8 years. When I tried this one, it metal plates wouldn&#x27;t even grip my hair no matter how hard I tried to hold them closed. Not impressed. I miss my old straightener!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice flat iron.  It works well on my stubborn waves.  My hair is too thick to use the wet to dry.  It would take a long time to get it done even though my hair is fairly short.  I did try it on damp hair too, but also, took a long time.  Thus, the 4 stars.  But as a regular flat iron, it&#x27;s great.  My hair didn&#x27;t get snagged on any parts of the iron, like it did on my old iron.  I&#x27;m glad I chose this one, even thought I can&#x27;t use it on my damp hair.</li>
    <li> I had never straightened my own hair before, so I was apprehensive about purchasing a straightener, However, it&#x27;s been wonderful! My hair can successfully go from wet to sleek/straight/dry in minutes!</li>
    <li> Why buy a $100 flat iron when you can buy this.  This has a stem button.  I have very curly thick hair, this makes my hair very straight and stays straight until next washing.  Arrived in timely manner.  Brand new.</li>
    <li> I got this wet-to-straight flat iron for my daughter who hates to have to dry her hair and then straighten it. This makes it a breeze! She still has to dry her hair a bit, but this certainly cuts the drying time down. It&#x27;s a great product - well put together and does what it promises.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LIKES THIS IRON HAIR, BUT SHE WANTED AS A MAJOR DIAMETER IS LIFE SO DO, WELL I A GOOD BUYING</li>
    <li> What I especially aplreciate about this product is how it doesnt weigh down the hair like some products that promote shininess do. Gives the hair shine, with or without gels etc in the hair. Also a good freshener if you havent shampooed in a few days. It will be interesting to see how long the shiney properties last&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only real drawback is that you cant lock it for easy transporting of it</li>
    <li> I already owned a Remington &amp;#34;Wet 2 Straight&amp;#34; and loved it and wanted a second one. The picture for this order was identical and I was happy I found it. However when I received it, I got a different model which is horrible. They sent one with &amp;#34;SOY&amp;#34; whatever that means and it has a wheel dial setting...and does not do a good job, it doesnt close properly and the plates are totally different. I do not recommend this product at all. Today I found the one I wanted at my local Walgreens where I had purchased the original one......</li>
    <li> This was for my daughter, she will only use this particular one.  Her last one lasted over two years of everyday use.</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Efficient on damp hair&lt;br /&gt;Straightened with one pass&lt;br /&gt;Great price value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;The iron is curved on the end and will not stand up on the bathroom counter&lt;br /&gt;Bad odor when the iron heated up. Could be that it was new&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the iron just for the price value and efficiency</li>
    <li> I never realized how bad my old flat iron was until I started using this one.  What a difference it makes. leaves my hair shiny and&lt;br /&gt;smooth.</li>
    <li> This straightened works great. I have really long hair and it takes a while to complete. Gets hot quickly. The box didn&#x27;t include any instructions and this is the first straightened I&#x27;ve owned so I&#x27;m not sure what the dial is for.</li>
    <li> Great value, really works straightening my wavey hair.</li>
    <li> I like how this flat iron makes my hair so silky, shiny and smooth. It´s worth the money. I love it</li>
    <li> I chose this rating for this article that I was looking for and it was for a gift for a very special person, thanks.</li>
    <li> My daughter got this item for Christmas &amp; she loves it. As with any hot item, it steams when it hits wet hair, but she is used to that, as all wet to straight irons do that. It straightens quickly, with just a couple of passes.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, has all automatic and leaves hair shiny with just a few strokes. Excellent price-quality relationship I recomened buy.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and I like the fact that it has soy to shine my hair, but it&#x27;s so slippery sometimes my fine hair falls through. I have to hold it tighter to dry/straighten my hair. But it&#x27;s a vast improvement from my old 2 inch Remington model. It&#x27;s much smaller and lighter and easier to travel with.</li>
    <li> works a  charm ! just make sure the steam is away from your face!</li>
    <li> Iron did not grasp tightly on to hair...product was returned for refund.</li>
    <li> My daughter has had probably 6 flat irons over the past year or so.  She straightens her hair daily and sometimes twice daily.  It&#x27;s difficult to find one that she likes and that I don&#x27;t mind spending the money for.  This Remington is ideal for us both.  It works great on her hair and with the soy complex leaves her hair soft and shiny rather than burnt looking even when it&#x27;s on the highest heat setting (and it does get HOT).  The wet to straight process does work but if you have thick hair it&#x27;s not great.  You definitely have to work in very small sections if you&#x27;re trying to go from wet to straight without blow drying.  It might work fine for thin hair but no one in my family has thin hair so I can&#x27;t comment on that. Overall, this is a compact and nice looking hair appliance which works well.  It is also a very good value at less than $25.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a new flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair which makes it more difficult to straighten. I usually have to separate the top layers from the bottom layers in order to straighten my hair to get mediocre results after an hour of straightening.  However, with the Remington straightener I have more control . I can completely straighten my WET hair in 30 minutes!  Straightening wet hair seems to provide better results and my hair stays straight all day long.  After using this for over a month my hair is still smooth and not \\&quot;fried\\&quot;.  The only complaint that I have is that my hand and thumbs get tired after about 15-20 minutes of using the straightener as it is a little heavy and you have to press down on the plates to keep them closed as you straighten each section of hair.  However, I would purchase this product and recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this b/c I have naturally curly hair that kinks up in the NC humidity. I thought the steam might hinder the straightening, but it doesn&#x27;t. The vent holes at the top let the steam escape so it does not interfere with your hair at all. Thanks to the salon-high temps, this flat iron will straighten and leave your hair straight all day long. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments since I switched to this iron b/c it really does straighten my hair...the other one really just calmed it down. I highly recommend this flat iron. My hair is really stubborn and annoying, and it works great!</li>
