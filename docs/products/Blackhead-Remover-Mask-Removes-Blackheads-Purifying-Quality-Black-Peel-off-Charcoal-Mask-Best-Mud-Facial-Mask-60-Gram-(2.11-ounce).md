      <li>A very good zester for the a low price.</li>
      <li>The construction of the product isn&#x27;t top drawer, but in terms of functionality, I think it is well worth it!</li>

      <li>The cover doesn&#x27;t easily slip off either, so I had to snap it off by pulling off the sides, but since the construction was so flimsy, it was pretty easy to force it off.  </li>
      <li>The very first thing that I noticed about this zester is how cheap it felt.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s longevity, but from what I&#x27;ve experienced thus far, I would highly recommend this kitchen gadget.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a zester for a while, but for whatever reason I never bought one and had been using a coarse grater instead.  Well, I&#x27;m glad I picked this one up!  The zest it produces is much more even and fine than my other grater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought it was going to be flimsy because it&#x27;s so light-weight, but it&#x27;s very sharp (I&#x27;m wearing a band-aid on my thumb as I type this due to a slip.) so it doesn&#x27;t have to be heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great tool and I&#x27;m glad I got it!</li>
    <li> This is my first zester! I love it! I&#x27;ve used it for lemons and cheese. The handle is comfortable! I really like the plastic cover for storing. I&#x27;m going to try zesting some chocolate over ice cream next!</li>
    <li> My first thought when I picked it up was that it was really light and fits comfortably in my hand. The blade is very sharp and the plastic cover is a great add on to keep it sharp. I only used it on a lemon though. I may update this review once I try chocolate, almonds, and other foods. My only concern is if the blade will stay sharp in the long run. I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made zester/grater. I&#x27;ve tried in out on various items, such as lemons, oranges and cheese, and due to the sharpness of the blades, it&#x27;s extremely easy to zest and grate. One of the things that I especially like about this, is the extremely comfortable rubber coated handle. It also comes with a hole in the handle for hanging, which I consider a nice additional touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 18/8 stainless steel blades are super sharp and are perfect for grating or zesting just about anything. In addition, the item comes with a plastic cover, making it safer when stored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zesting food items with this product introduces the opportunity to add all sorts of new flavors to your favorite foods. It can even be used to add additional flavors to drinks or plain water. When I zested the lemons and oranges, I added them to plain water and the taste was very nice and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this is an extremely well made item that you&#x27;ll find numerous uses for in the kitchen. It&#x27;s one of those items that you may never have had, but now that you do, you wonder how you ever got along without it.</li>
    <li> Received the Best Zest Lemon Zester and Cheese Grater, Black with Stainless Steel, Cover Included today 5/7/15. I came straight home and tried it out! I didn&#x27;t have any cheese so I used a baby carrot! It finely grated the carrot up. Perfect for any salad or food needing any fine grated pieces.</li>
    <li> i love this. i use it for my salads now that i triyn to eat healthier, adn it works great</li>
    <li> Works great! Love this zester. I&#x27;ve used it several times now while cooking during the holidays. I especially like the shape as it holds all the tiniest pieces in.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice zester, it is weighted really nicely and does a great job.  I like that it comes with a cover so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it nicking me when I am searching through drawers.  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the edges are not rolled metal, the underside metal should be rolled around a bit more, makes me a little nervous about if my hand slips.  I did receive a discount in exchange for my honest review of this product.</li>
    <li> Just received today and immediately put it thru the test! Passed with flying colors! Love that it comes with a protective sleeve for storage, very durable and great length! Handle is also very comfortable. Works great! A+</li>
    <li> Does the trick, quality is decent. No reason not to give it 5 stars,</li>
    <li> Works well for the price but didn&#x27;t stay sharp long.</li>
    <li> i got this product discounted to try and review and i like it. Great little tool. handle is a good sturdy one and love the cover that came with it. Don&#x27; t have to worry about that accidentally cut when pulling it out the drawer like other graders . great little tool to have and keep handy</li>
    <li> This zester is great. It is sturdy made with a really solid handle.  The grater is super sharp. I&#x27;ve used on citrus, nutmeg, and hard Romano cheese. Works wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love this zester/grater!  I got it yesterday and so far I&#x27;ve zested fruit and grated cheese quickly and easily.  I was especially impressed with how well it zested my oranges.  The whole house smelled like citrus and I got extremely fine pieces that are perfect for adding a little flavor to my holiday treats.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, easy to store and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning it passed my biggest test.  I often have problems with kitchen tools that have metal bodies and plastic handles when I run them through the dishwasher.  If the piece is cheaply made, water seeps in and collects inside the plastic handle.  There the water sits, getting stinky and gross and ready to drip out on me the next time I use it.  I ran this one through the dishwasher and it&#x27;s clearly solidly made!  No little holes for water to leak in and collect in the handle.  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> The best dearer I&#x27;ve ever had,  I snagged it for free also,  very happy thank-you</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product. Very durable and lives up to it&#x27;s name. It dose a great job. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use this all of the time.  It is very simple to use.  I have sent it through my dishwasher and it has held up well, also.</li>
    <li> I love to bake and I use lemon/ orange zest all the time. This comes in really handy. I dont have to use my big grater anymore. Very easy to clean and it doesnt take up a lot of space in my drawers</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well.</li>
    <li> Used it to zest over FIFTY meyer lemons...awesome tool!</li>
    <li> I got this at is discounted price. I absolutely love it. It works great and definitely is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. The item itself looks and feels like it is high quality compared to some similar products I have seen. It is sturdy and I expect that it will last a good while. The blade cover is a good bonus. So far I have used it to grate cheese and it does the job. No issues thus far. It came in just a plain white box and the handle was a little dusty, so the packaging is nothing to write home about, but I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> was perfect for out kitchen it was small enough that it didnt take up a lot of room, worked like it was suppose to and was good for smaller items to grate, bigger items it worked but bayed a little</li>
    <li> This is the worst zester ever! I would give it negative stars but that&#x27;s not possible. I wanted to zest a lemon and since the blades are way too sharp I ended up cutting three of my fingers pretty badly. I was very careful when using this product and it still ended up cutting me.No product should be that sharp that it hurts someone. I hate this product it&#x27;s not worth your money. Also the cover has two holes so you could still cut yourself when it is in the drawer. This product is dangerous to have in the house with or without kids. Don&#x27;t even waste your money on this horrible product find a product that&#x27;s not overly sharp like this one. I got this product for free to review.</li>
    <li> Great! I waited too long to buy a Zester that actually works. No more cheapies for me. This one is a great buy and works&lt;br /&gt;like you expect them to. (I hardly ever give anything 5 stars.) This is not the highest price one.. but it is up there in quality&lt;br /&gt;and will not disappoint you.</li>
    <li> No surprises, does its job. Feels very solid unlike some of the cheap ones made in China.</li>
    <li> This thing is perfect for what I got it for. It&#x27;s an easy to handle cheese grater, and the perfect zester. Love it!</li>
    <li> Everyone should have one of these!</li>
    <li> A very good zester for the a low price. I was impressed with the quality. Well built.</li>
    <li> Great Zester!  Very sharp and easy to use- also comes with a nice heavy duty snap on cover for storage.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a zester for a while; this one fits the task perfectly. It is also useful for chocolate shavings on cakes and other desserts. It is easy to clean and no more looking in my box grater after it runs through the dishwasher to make sure everything got out. One trick - use this zester/grater for garlic in place of trying to cut with a knife.</li>
    <li> It looks great and works great.</li>
    <li> I received and use this today as soon as it arrived. First impression: it is very long,I like it liek this because sometimes I hate the feeling of &#x27;running out of room¨ with other graters.&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality and I really liek the ¨cover¨ to put it on when is not in use. And after all of this,it looks very nice in the kitchen!</li>
    <li> I received the Best Zest Premium Lemon Zester and Cheese Grater, Black with Stainless Steel, Cover Included to try in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own and in no way was I influenced by anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;First off I&#x27;ve been wanting a good quality well made zester for a long time and was extremely excited to be getting this! I love to cook and watch cooking shows all the time. Rachael Ray especially uses one of these all the time and I&#x27;m so jealous every time she uses one (which is a lot). I have had a couple cheese graters that I used a lot but one I had to throw away. It was uncomfortable started rusting and I couldn&#x27;t really use as a zester anyway. The other is a black coated box grater and the coating it starting to come off and it&#x27;s pretty dull especially compared to this zester. We love garlic in everything it seems and especially fresh garlic but it&#x27;s such a pain to use just a knife and not very effective with the grater I have.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said the best zester is super sharp and the handle is very comfortable. I couldn&#x27;t wait to start using it with everything immediately. I love fresh homemade guacamole and was waiting anxiously for this to come so I could immediately zest my fresh garlic. It was so fast and easy and perfect. I fell in love. I used it to grate my red onion too and even put a little of the lime zest in there too because I just wanted to keep using it so I figured I would try something new. I also regularly use fresh Parmesan and this made it so much faster and nicer as well. I have even been looking up recipes just to be able to use it more. I&#x27;m also looking forward to bring able to use fresh ginger, cinnamon sticks, chocolate and other things I don&#x27;t normally use in that form. It was easy to clean and I know it won&#x27;t rust and will stay sharp and last a long time because it&#x27;s stainless steel. I can also put it in the dishwasher if I want. I love that it has a cover because it is very sharp and I have little kids. I&#x27;m trying to figure out if I want to hang it for that reason also, but it&#x27;s nice just knowing I can because of the hole in the handle. I would definitely recommend this to anyone in the market for one. Regular price is $24.99 and right now it&#x27;s $8.95 and free shipping with prime. 64% off. I almost forgot it also includes a lifetime guarantee!

    <li> We have been searching for a good grater and this one is amazing! It&#x27;s the perfect size and easy to use and handle. We use it all the time to grate cheese (we love Italian food in my house) and it is perfect for grating cheese! The package was also delivered quickly and on time!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Easy to use and clean.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The zester came very quickly. I used it on cheese and lemons and it worked really well. For cheese you will not want to go back to using a regular grater. A word of caution though, it is very sharp and will cut you if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> Nice comfortable handle, long grater which makes it really easy to zest a lemon or grate some cheese.  Very comfortable and easy to use.  Also came with a really nice protective cover as the grater is sharp.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Easy to use, clean and store. Multiple uses.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to test this product for free and let you guys know what I think about it!&lt;br /&gt;Positives:  First thing, this is a great zester worth owning!  It has a hard rubber handle making it easy to hold and giving you the ability to keep a strong tight grip on it.  The blade length is great and it is good and sharp.  This product seems like it will stand the test of time and use.&lt;br /&gt;My negatives on this product is the inward curve of the blade on the underside, it slants in so sharply forming a protected cavity that some of your zest can get into and there is no easy way to get it out on the same hand making it difficult to clean after use.  Also the protective cover that comes with this product has two 1&amp;#34; long holes exposing the blade of the zester which sort of defeats the safety aspect of having the cover.</li>
    <li> I was able to use this last night while making shrimp scampi and it worked beautifully on both the lemon as well as the fresh parmesan.  Unlike the zester I had previously , this zester works with hardly any effort and produces nice zest strings.  It seems solidly made and cleaned up nicely in the dishwasher.  I&#x27;ve only had this for a short while, so I can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s longevity, but from what I&#x27;ve experienced thus far, I would highly recommend this kitchen gadget.</li>
    <li> The very first thing that I noticed about this zester is how cheap it felt.  The handle has a rubbery grip like an OXO product, but it has no weight to it.  The grater itself is made of a thin metal, and while it&#x27;s sharp, it feels really flimsy.  It also comes with a plastic, slip-on cover that feels like really cheap and rough plastic.  The cover doesn&#x27;t easily slip off either, so I had to snap it off by pulling off the sides, but since the construction was so flimsy, it was pretty easy to force it off.  The edges of the grater portion aren&#x27;t blunted or rolled either, so the whole product just feels kind of unfinished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a zester/grater, it actually works pretty well, but I don&#x27;t think this thing will hold up to much heavy use.  A quick search on Amazon shows that there are plenty of other zesters within the same price range including one made by OXO and even one that&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Truth in advertising: this really is the best zester I have used. The grating part is nice and sharp and nicely spaced so that I get distinct shreds of lemon or orange or Parmesan cheese rather than a gummed up mess. The construction of the product isn&#x27;t top drawer, but in terms of functionality, I think it is well worth it!</li>
    <li> This has started to become one of my favorite kitchen items! It works wonderful and I&#x27;m so glad that I made the purchase :)</li>
    <li> Seriously the best addition to my kitchen!! This zester is super easy to use and works amazing. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I received this product and was delighted by the quality construction of this zester.  It has a 8&amp;#34; grating blade with a 4-1/2&amp;#34; handle.  The oversize handle provides stability and a nice comfortable grip.  The blade comes with a protective cover to minimize the risk of accidents.  The edges of the back side of the blade are still quite sharp, so use caution while cleaning.  It does come with rubberized tips on the end to minimize sharp edges.  It has a hole in the handle for hanging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This grater has performed flawlessly in grating parmesan cheese as well as testing citrus fruits, but it can also be used for chocolate, nutmeg, and other spices as well.  It grates consistently without clogging up.  It leaves little to no residue on the grater itself.  It is very simple to clean and then I like to hang mine to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> BestZester ever. All my cowokers are always asking to use it because it out does theres.</li>
    <li> A useful tool for zesting citrus or grating chunks of parm. I would prefer a slightly more solid construction of this microplaner, but for the price it is a great little tool.</li>
