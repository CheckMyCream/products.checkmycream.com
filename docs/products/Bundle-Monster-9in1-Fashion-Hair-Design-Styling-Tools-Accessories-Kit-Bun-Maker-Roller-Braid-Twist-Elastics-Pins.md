      <li>The products work, but make sure you verify what color you are getting.  </li>
      <li>This kit is ok.  </li>
      <li>Love this kit.</li>
      <li>Look up more instructions on youtube or else</li>
      <li>All the tools are so easy to use and the instructions that come with the kit are fantastic.</li>
      <li>Amazed at how easy and fast she is able to create stylish up-dews.</li>

      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>This bundle of hair accessories are all you need to style your hair quickly and effortlessly.</li>
      <li>but this set really helps and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The plastic on the hair loops are really cheap and will not withstand much pulling/twisting.</li>
      <li>things are interesting; really easy to use but not super useful.</li>
      <li>This kit had more than enough stuff to do my hair, my maid of honor&#x27;s hair, my bridesmaid&#x27;s hair, my mother&#x27;s hair, and the flower girl&#x27;s hair for the wedding, which saved us a lot of money.</li>
      <li>exactly as described</li>
      <li>shipped fast!</li>
      <li>Great options for lazy hairstylists like me!</li>
      <li>But the products inside are great, they work surprisingly well with my thick and hard to handle type of hair...</li>
      <li>I would totally recommend this , comes with easy instructions</li>
      <li>This was not even strong enough to fix and hold hair up in a bun .</li>
      <li>I have very thick, curly hair and all the pieces work great with my hair type.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok for a young girl who is experimenting with her hair and trying different style I guess!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any of the bun tools but they seem kind of gimmicky.</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t used all of the products but comes with 2 hair loop tools (second from left on top row).  </li>
      <li>My first big pony loop broke the first day a got the thing.</li>
      <li>So far, I have learned to love the donut bun maker due to some youtube videos.</li>
      <li>when I got the box in the mail It was missing two items the magic hair twist styling braid tool care clip and the plastic hair bun makers</li>
      <li>Instructions were a bit confusing at first but once figured out it&#x27;s easy to do.</li>
      <li>Lack of clear instructions on how to use it.</li>
      <li>Does not have good instructions, very poor.</li>
      <li>The main downside is that the instructions are unclear, so I would recommend a how-to book such as &amp;#34;Braids, Buns, and Twists!&amp;#34; to go along with it.</li>
      <li>I expected better as far as the instructions it comes with, they are not very legible and it only comes with a few.</li>

<li> items weight are too heavy</li>
<li> I got the package, opened it and the first thing I saw was a side of the plastic tube that contains the set, totally damaged: the plastic was toasted due to its age or terrible</li>
<li> Instructions on inlet is too small and unreadable.</li>
<li> When I bought this I thought it was something that would tame my thick head of hair</li>
<li> Would not recommend to anyone with thick hair .</li>
<li> base of the package: broken.&lt;br</li>
<li> This product is terrible!!!</li>
<li> /&gt;I am about to start using the product, just hope it is not as disgusting as the package it came in.</li>
<li> The bumps look terrible and don&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> The directions were horrible.</li>

    <li> This bundle of hair accessories are all you need to style your hair quickly and effortlessly. If you&#x27;ve never you&#x27;ve some of these, the instructions may seem sparse. Just Google the item and you&#x27;ll find lots of youtube videos to help you use the accessory. They won&#x27;t last forever, but they&#x27;re affordable enough to replace as needed.</li>
    <li> The spiral pins do not have any coating un the ends and snag and rip hair. Ouch!</li>
    <li> Great options for lazy hairstylists like me!</li>
    <li> Lack of clear instructions on how to use it. Instructions on inlet is too small and unreadable. Website doesn&#x27;t have them either</li>
    <li> Love this kit. This was my second one.</li>
    <li> different, don&#x27;t know how to use them, but will learn</li>
    <li> Came with everything but can&#x27;t understand how to use them.</li>
    <li> This package is amazing, it had everything I needed to do my hair up like Belle for my cosplay for A-Kon and more. I am incredibly glad I purchased it, anytime during the con that I needed anything for my hair, I had it, everyone was complimenting my perfect bun all day, and i was thrilled to tell them how easy it had been to do!</li>
    <li> I love how many things you can do with it. I would totally recommend this , comes with easy instructions</li>
    <li> I expected better as far as the instructions it comes with, they are not very legible and it only comes with a few. But the products inside are great, they work surprisingly well with my thick and hard to handle type of hair... Look up more instructions on youtube or else and you&#x27;ll be good to go :)</li>
    <li> shipped fast! love all the easy, cute hairstyles I can now create for my daughter and me! exactly as described</li>
    <li> This product is terrible!!! My first big pony loop broke the first day a got the thing. My second pony loop broke on the fourth day of having it. The bumps look terrible and don&#x27;t work. Neither do the two buns wraps. The directions were horrible. You can&#x27;t even understand them. Overall very unhappy with the whole product. Two thumbs down!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do my hair often so I wanted a lot of options for my wedding. This kit had more than enough stuff to do my hair, my maid of honor&#x27;s hair, my bridesmaid&#x27;s hair, my mother&#x27;s hair, and the flower girl&#x27;s hair for the wedding, which saved us a lot of money. The main downside is that the instructions are unclear, so I would recommend a how-to book such as &amp;#34;Braids, Buns, and Twists!&amp;#34; to go along with it.</li>
    <li> I am always worried about the accessories I use with my hair because it is fragile and prone to breaking. These come clothe covered and are more gentle on your hair and easy to use. The bun makers are huge and create beautiful full buns very quickly. I use this kit for when I have Drill in the army.</li>
    <li> Instructions were a bit confusing at first but once figured out it&#x27;s easy to do.</li>
    <li> it has everything you needed for hair updos.</li>
    <li> The kit is good for the price and quantity of products. The instruction sheet images are not understood.</li>
    <li> Does not have good instructions, very poor. Some of the items do not hold up my hair. It&#x27;s not for people with a lot of hair or in layers.</li>
    <li> Such a hair saver! I have use for practically everything in this bundle, and it&#x27;s a good pretty good price!</li>
    <li> Not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be...</li>
    <li> Just a total must have for girls of all ages!</li>
    <li> I love all the options that this kit allows for me to do with my hair. All the tools are so easy to use and the instructions that come with the kit are fantastic. I have very thick, curly hair and all the pieces work great with my hair type. If you are looking for different ways to style your hair this is the go to kit for you!&lt;br /&gt;This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This kit is ok.  Not what I was expecting.  Cheap products in it.  Get what you pay for!!  It&#x27;s ok for a young girl who is experimenting with her hair and trying different style I guess!</li>
    <li> The plastic on the hair loops are really cheap and will not withstand much pulling/twisting. The included hair pins are stronger than normal drugstore ones but the paint is pretty uneven which is a bit annoying. The u pins are really strong and good for buns.The hair bump things are interesting; really easy to use but not super useful. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the bun tools but they seem kind of gimmicky. Overall, I would probably not buy it again but just buy the pieces I need individually.</li>
    <li> when I got the box in the mail It was missing two items the magic hair twist styling braid tool care clip and the plastic hair bun makers</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used all of the products but comes with 2 hair loop tools (second from left on top row).  The larger hair loop tool broke after 1 use.  Using smaller version without problems but will see.</li>
    <li> items weight are too heavy</li>
    <li> Writing on behalf of the wife who is so glad she purchased this kit. Amazed at how easy and fast she is able to create stylish up-dews. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This product is nice. However, the instructions are not very clear, but there are some. Once you go on youtube, you can figure out how to use these products. So far, I have learned to love the donut bun maker due to some youtube videos. Videos are best to look at when using these. As time goes on, I&#x27;m sure I will eventually love this!</li>
    <li> It met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I got this product in a week. The price is good compared with others. Very easy to use as well.</li>
    <li> When I bought this I thought it was something that would tame my thick head of hair but no . This was not even strong enough to fix and hold hair up in a bun . Would not recommend to anyone with thick hair .</li>
    <li> It is a nice set, I am really bad changing styles but this set really helps and easy to use.  I liked it</li>
    <li> Instructions for all items would have been nice. But great for the price</li>
    <li> Nice product and shipping!</li>
    <li> Pieces are falling apart only after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Really just a bunch of plastic weird things with no directions.</li>
    <li> I got the package, opened it and the first thing I saw was a side of the plastic tube that contains the set, totally damaged: the plastic was toasted due to its age or terrible storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I opened the tube, its cap was practically destroyed. Once I took all the devices from the package, I discover a bunch of LITTLE HAIRS at the bottom!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base of the package: broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am about to start using the product, just hope it is not as disgusting as the package it came in.</li>
    <li> The products work, but make sure you verify what color you are getting.  I have brown hair and need brown for the military, but I got it in black, and these aren&#x27;t going to be allowed in uniform because they don&#x27;t match my hair color.</li>
