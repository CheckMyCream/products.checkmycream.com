    <li> I love this product.  My skin is smooth after applying.  I can see an&lt;br /&gt;improvement in my skin on face and neck. I just wish the capsules&lt;br /&gt;were bigger so it would cover more area.</li>
    <li> Rapid Transport C Infused High Potent-C Anti-Wrinkle helps tremendously with this area of skin. Makes the skin become soft &amp; so smooth</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed too much difference.  But I will continue to use it and wait to see. I will give another review when I finish the product...</li>
    <li> I use the liquid Vitamin C - needed to find the individual capsules for my face. This does the trick, also the compact it comes in - is easy to travel with</li>
    <li> I liked it for it absorbed into my skin easy.</li>
    <li> It seems to help fill in the wrinkles for a 71 year old Grandma.</li>
    <li> The item is not working very well, I am not very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I GOT THESE AND THE CAPSULES ARE SO HARD, AND THE CREAM IS OLD AND YELLOW NOT FRESH AS USUAL...THEY ARE MY REGULAR SO I KNOW HOW THEY SHOULD BE,  JUST A THROW AWAY AS I THOUGHT POSTAGE WAS AWFUL GETTING THEM HERE, NOT WASTING MORE SENDING BACK!!!!  NO MORE WILL BE ORDER OF ANY THESE PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON, TO MUCH INDIVIDUAL POSTAGE, COST MORE THAN PRODUCTS ON QVC</li>
    <li> I am 67 years old and have been using this product for years.  Vitamin C is a must and I look like I am 57.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift. The person who got it liked the individual capsules and believes the product helped reduce fine lines. They liked it.</li>
    <li> Just received. Capsules are very hard, hence... they&#x27;ve been sitting around for a long, long time. One capsule was devoid of product. I don&#x27;t know how many are supposed to be in a compact but there were 35 plus the empty one. Anyone know how many in .6 oz.? I will return and expect full s&amp;h charges credited to my account for delivery and return. This was a defective, old and used product that should not have been offered to any customer. I love SCA products but I&#x27;m not using discarded, dried out ones at any price.</li>
    <li> Did exactly as it was supposed to do and at a very, very good price.  Would definitely but it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for reducing the appearance of even deeper lines in the forehead.  Rather use this than some injectable filler.</li>
    <li> The item was a gift sent to my grandmother who absolutely loved it. She usually orders it on her own but I sent it as a gift.</li>
    <li> Item arrived very quickly and well packaged and a fair price excellent service highly reccomend to anyone seeking signature club A items. Again I was very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Capsules are wonderful and easy to use.  I add some cheek color and lipstick  and undereye cover and  I am done for the day! Wonderful !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years but never bought it at such a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and am very happy with it.  It seems to help with wrinkle prevention.</li>
    <li> Use at night three times a week...you will notice brighter, smoother, clearer complexion in less than a week. You don&#x27;t need to purchase the hold line these capsule are the crown jewels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used these for about 3 weeks, can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any big difference on my skin, but I&#x27;ll continue to use them.</li>
