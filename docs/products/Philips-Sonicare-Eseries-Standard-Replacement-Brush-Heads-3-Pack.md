<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Delivery was swift.  I especially like the &amp;#34;frustration free packaging.&amp;#34;  I hate fighting with plastic &amp;#34;protective&amp;#34; packaging.  This was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The only way I want to brush my teeth. It works well and I am satified.</li>
    <li> Been using the E series electric toothbrush for several years now. These heads come in the cardboard box shown, and it is simple to get in! The brush heads are not knockoffs, and perform as expected.</li>
    <li> Our family has been using Sonicare tooth brushes for years. These E series heads are getting hard to  find in the stores as they keep on coming up with new models. Good quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re tooth brush heads and they work.  PERIOD.</li>
    <li> These work better than the original ones that came with the toothbrush. They are stiffer bristles and to me it vibrates even more than the one that it came with. Works like a charm and we scored them at a great deal!</li>
    <li> Good deal for replacement heads in a market that is perpetually pushing you to buy a new model when the old one is still going strong. These heads work great for several older ones I have.</li>
    <li> HX7022--30&lt;br /&gt;the&#x3D; BRUSH HEADs &#x3D;perfect !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;u should replace__ BRUSHES__several&lt;br /&gt;times a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; a GREAT buy--fast ship&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bbp</li>
    <li> I have purchase the full Sonic tooth brush with the cleaners to desifected the family tooth brushes. This tooth brushes are great keeps your teeth like if you have gone to the dentist. I am the only one that I use it since I am widow. I still order them all the time.</li>
    <li> I got the frustration-free packing 2-pack on auto-ship. Its awesome. It gets to my door and reminds me to change my toothbrush heads. I have no problem with a head lasting 2-3 months. Sure, after 2-3 months, its worn out; its a toothbrush. They are supposed to be disposable. Overall, great quality. I keep on ordering them.</li>
    <li> The second head did not operate properly and magnets cause brush to hum loudly and vibrate terribly. Flaw in the e series brushes have caused me to replace handle and heads many times. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. These are knock offs. One did not fit and the other is crocked with vibration issues. Ended up going to the store to buy real ones.</li>
    <li> Great &amp;#34;no frills&amp;#34; packaging and work beautifully</li>
    <li> These are getting hard to find in my little market, and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m schlepping all over a super duper We Say So box store for them.  It was great to find them in my recliner, and I didn&#x27;t even have to buy any $5 gas to go get them.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  These are the genuine Philips replacements for some of their Sonicare toothbrushes. They work fine.&lt;br /&gt;Would like to give 5 stars but felt I had to ding them one star because the color indicator bristles (which suggest when to replace the brush head) seem to turn from blue to white much earlier than needed IMHO. I find that even though the color change suggests replacement, the brush head is still in good condition and could be used for another month at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would a manufacturer design early obsolescence into a product to increase sales?  Naaaah.  Good product though.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of this type of toothbrush. The first one lasted many years, and this one is on it&#x27;s second year and going strong. These replacement heads are pricey, but they are good quality and last a fairly long time. It&#x27;s an older version of the brush, so I&#x27;m glad I can still find these replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Have used this for the past eight years. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Walmart charges $25 for one head I got two for the price of one and there is no difference.  This is my second order for this product and as long as I can get them here I will continue to order and save.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else to say - they do just what they&#x27;re supposed to do! My teeth are clean.</li>
    <li> Best price we&#x27;ve found for replacement heads and the packaging beats the heck out of struggling with the retail clam shell packaging.</li>
    <li> Love products. Keeps my teeth &amp; gums healthy, &amp; reduces the need for frequent dental visits.  Great investment. 5 stars</li>
    <li> I need to start taking my Sonicare on the road with me because every time I go away and use a regular toothbrush my gums get sore. My mouth is so happy when I come home and use my Sonicare! The packaging on this product is SO MUCH BETTER than buying it in the store and having to rip it apart with a chainsaw. It&#x27;s a simple plastic bag in a cardboard box. Easy. My only complaint is that the colors Amazon sends me are so ugly, and it&#x27;s hard to tell my husband&#x27;s and mine apart. But whatever. My gums don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s cute, they just want to be CLEAN!</li>
    <li> I thought this was a very good by for an excellent product.  Need to find coupons for discounts for this item that is needed every 3 months.</li>
    <li> I thought I would save money and get off the shelf third party for my Philips sonicare toothbrush. bad move. in contrast to the third party brushes, these are quiet, lighter and have the little brush covers for when traveling.</li>
    <li> Good quality and has lasted as long as original, will buy again. This product is a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush. Haven&#x27;t had a cavity in years thanks to this baby. You do need to really keep them clean however. Inside they get all full of gunk and it&#x27;s gross. Use hot water and baking soda to clean. But make sure the water isn&#x27;t boiling or you&#x27;ll melt the plastic!</li>
    <li> always on time and always good quality</li>
    <li> Works as expected and is not unusually noisy like replacement heads from some other manufacturers. Overpriced, though.</li>
    <li> cheepest price i could find. great product too!</li>
    <li> I have ordered these before and it&#x27;s not that I can&#x27;t use them, but this time they are so soft that they felt &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; the first time I used them.  I don&#x27;t think there are choices as far as the firmness of the brush.  However it won&#x27;t stop me from ordering again.</li>
    <li> Sonicare are the best electric tooth brushes and need replacement heads occasionally</li>
    <li> For me these brush heads last a little less than a month.  I wish the heads were larger as they are smaller than most manual toothbrush heads.  It&#x27;s really important to replace these frequently or at least clean out the connection area between this part and the tooth brush handle to keep optimal performance of the device.</li>
    <li> Reliable brand. As a subscribe and save member, My husband and I have been using those for more than 3 years and are quite satisfied with their performances. Will stay with those.</li>
    <li> These are absolute JUNK. DO NOT BUY!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice toothbrush, and I use the auto buy for this item which is easier than trying to remember on my own when to purchase more and replace them.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and just what I needed</li>
    <li> Work great, real thing.</li>
    <li> I have had my electric tooth brush for 4 years and I love it. The replacement heads are easy to install. You just twist off the old one at the base and screw on a new one. I have had no problems with my Sonicare brush and hope that it will continue to last for a long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always good to have a few spare brush heads for my Sonicare. The one&#x27;s I ordered came in a brown box allowing easy opening. They usually last through 6 months of use. I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Buying these via Subscribe and Save is the only way to get them at a reasonable price first off.  On top of that it kind of forces me to swamp them out regularly instead of using them too long.  So it&#x27;s a good move.</li>
    <li> Love the sonicare e series. I can actually feel the difference. Soft packing makes it great when traveling. It keeps a charge for a week without having to carry the charger.</li>
    <li> These are replacements for my wife&#x27;s tooth brush. They are exactly as advertised and meet her needs well.</li>
    <li> The price is much better than we could get at regular department stores. This product guaranties good checkups at the dentist.</li>
    <li> These are factory replacements, designed for the newer brushes but backwards compatible with the Advance (which is what we have).  As far as price, the big box membership stores have 4 packs for about the same unit cost, maybe less.  I&#x27;ll probably just do the big box approach next time.  Product is the same.</li>
    <li> We have had this toothbrush system for years and love it. Could not find these at the WalMart I shop at so Amazon saved the day! Fit perfect and was exactly what I needed as replacements.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, and as promised.  Very good job - thank you much.</li>
    <li> I have used generic replacements and they do not work. Stick with SoniCare and you will be fine.</li>
    <li> This Phillips  Sonicare HX7022/30 E series are the greatest for cleaning  our teeth  .these brush are better that the regular tooth brushes  .  cleans teeth 10  x times better  We love these brushes</li>
    <li> I once bought the generic brand brush heads and they were awful. They just didn&#x27;t attach quite right and the power wasn&#x27;t as good. These are great and work just as well as the original that came with the brush. Do not try to save money with another brand get these.</li>
    <li> Brush heads are brand name at a less expensive price than any stores in my area.  Shipping is free with the &amp;#34;Subscribe &amp; Save,&amp;#34; another plus.  Usually if I look for them locally, the stores are out of stock, a lot higher in price, and/or don&#x27;t have the style I want (compact heads, full size heads, etc.).  I&#x27;ve tried the generic brush heads that fit the Sonicare brushes and trust me, don&#x27;t waste your time and money.  They are the pits!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tooth brush for a couple years, and it must be doing the job because my dentest has been giving me better reports. It probably helps when using a product that has good replacement heads like these which seem to hold up very well, and seem to last beyond their recommended use period. They&#x27;re easy to replace, and to keep clean with the plunger, which helps break the head down in to two parts, for easy cleaning. They&#x27;re a decent buy on Amazon overall, but if you have several in the house using these, the larger packages offered here, are probably a better buy, but still its a solid 4 star product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used Sonicare brushes since my parents made me switch when I was a kid to a motorized toothbrush. I was too lazy when I was little and would barely brush my teeth. It seems to me that their quality has not gone down and is still great. Would definitely recommend to anyone who would ask.</li>
    <li> Just like original at a lower price -this toothbrush is one of the best purchases I have made.  Great reports from my Dentist</li>
    <li> My wife and I started using the Sonicare toothbrush when the very first model came out. Without a doubt, had it not been for the invention of this product and the excellent brushes that come with it, our teeth would be nowhere near as healthy as they are today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Sonicare has come out with several new and more efficient models since our first one, every new addition has been an improvement on the original. At first, the brushes were straight. Now, and as they&#x27;ve been for some time, the brushes are angled, so as to get better access to hard to reach areas. The brushes do an unsurpassed job of cleaning your teeth and removing plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that since purchasing our original Sonicare toothbrush and changing the brushes every six months, neither one of us has had any dental issues whatsoever. My dental hygienist said that since I do such a great job flossing and use the Sonicare toothbrush, there&#x27;s no need for me to be seen more than once a year.</li>
    <li> These can be hard to find in the stores these days.  Thank you very much - just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I hate Sonicare and never want to buy another item from them. This is the second time I have bought the wrong brush head, now it is too late to return it even though it has just sat in the box since January (until now when it is time to replace it). I can never figure out which brush goes to which head. So frustrating and another reason not to shop on Amazon either.</li>
    <li> My go-to toothbrush heads. Love that they come every couple of months to replace the old ones!</li>
    <li> Good price for original replacement parts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the latest versions of the replacement brushes had changed the configuration of the metal contacts on the bottom of the brush. Instead of being spaced out, they were placed together which made it seem like it wasn&#x27;t working as well. It might be a better setup but it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m used to. Luckily, I found these and, as you can see in the photo, the contacts are spaced and work exactly like I expect. I&#x27;m a happy camper. :)</li>
    <li> Just like the ones that came with the original set. No problems.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for me. I always forget to pick up heads for my Phillips Sonic Care toothbrush and having this automatically ship to me solves that in one click!  Nothing like a clean toothbrush head!!</li>
    <li> Great replacement for my worn out toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Love it on subscription...just get the package and know to change out my brushes every 3 months.</li>
    <li> Good gawd the difference between these and generics sold by Malwart is severe. Thus buy these as the alternative will rot your teeth! naw but you get the picture,.</li>
    <li> liked the easy open packaging. Don&#x27;t like the price</li>
    <li> Bristles fall out while brushing.</li>
    <li> These are genuine Sonicare brushes but they are very hard and stiff.  Much harder than the ones I had previously.  If you open your mouth even a little while brushing they will sling paste all over the place, that&#x27;s how stiff they are.  I&#x27;ve had it about a month and a half and hasn&#x27;t gotten softer.  I will definitely buy the soft ones next time.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t rreally judge these.  They were the wrong kind for my brush</li>
    <li> This is a perfect fit for my Philips Sonicare E Series toothbrush.  It&#x27;s really convenient to have them come to me, too, with Amazon subscription.  Nothing worse than going to CVS and having to hope they&#x27;re in stock, then find some drunk employee to unlock the toothbrush cabinet, urgh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top is as pictured, which is a little different from the brush top that originally came on it, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> The exact replacement I needed.</li>
    <li> These older head types are hard to keep clean on the inside.  Bacteria and mold easily grow there.  You have to screw it on and off to remove and clean them.  The newer models on the newer handles look to be easier to clean and change.</li>
    <li> Cost was high for a two pack. I found a four pack of the same at Sams Club for $29.00.</li>
    <li> Just what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are a good replacement for your Philips Sonicare toothbrush. I have previously ordered these heads and will continue to use amazon to replace them when they are worn out. Good quality!</li>
    <li> This is a very convenient way to purchase bulk paper, etc. and not have&lt;br /&gt;to carry it home from the store. Thanks for the quick shipment.&lt;br /&gt;LaVonna</li>
    <li> I tell everyone that they should get a Sonicare and Fully enjoy these toothbrush heads. Highly suggest that anyone looking for a new brush or a way to whiten your teeth look at a Sonicare!</li>
    <li> The E Series brush heads work fine. They are not as easy to use at the originals. Takes a fit of trial and error to fit the brush into the handle. Once the brush is in, it works fine. I have the very old Sonicare unit so it feels a bit like these are make-do since the originals are not made anymore. But, it is much better than having to buy an whole new unit.</li>
    <li> just ok not really what i was thinking but still ok to keep and use it for that price so i am going to use it</li>
    <li> These are good quality and exact replacements for the toothbrush.  While they are not inexpensive they are true Sonicare products....I will purchase them again.</li>
    <li> I held off on getting a Sonicare for a long time. I couldn&#x27;t justify the price... I mean how good could a toothbrush be?  Then I found one on sale. It&#x27;s so worth it that everyone in my house has one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Sonicare replacement heads are a lot better than the knockoff versions you find at Walmart or Target. Well worth the money to keep your chompers healthy.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to buy these, then you already own and have used a Sonicare toothbrush, and you know how well they work. These replacement heads in Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Frustration-free&amp;#34; packaging come in a single piece of cardboard with each brush in a simple thin plastic &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34;. No waste and no scissors needed to get to the brush heads. The price is at least several dollars less than you will find them in any retail store. What more can be said except &amp;#34;Thanks again, Amazon&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> These are very easy to change out, looks nice and work great!  I would recommend these over any other brand!</li>
    <li> Love cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> some people believe in electronic toothbrushes, some people don&#x27;t but Sonicare&#x27;s model is an excellent and price-conscious choice to learn what all the fuss is about.</li>
    <li> I get all my sonicate refills from you.</li>
    <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are the very BEST power toothbrushes on the market. I&#x27;ve noticed if you don&#x27;t change your head periodically it stops working effectively. I also noticed getting the standard size head with the full bristles works more effectively than the shorter type. I will no longer get that shorter one as it&#x27;s limited and doesn&#x27;t clean as well. I changed my replacement brush head recently and I noticed a huge performance difference in the power and functionality. I also highly recommend Sonicare for those who drink lots of coffee and want to whiten their teeth as well to the 110 brightness of printer paper. Combining the Sonicare toothbrush with Crest white strips supreme, you&#x27;ll have the best looking set of chompers out there!</li>
    <li> I hate buying these things but I do love my toothbrush so i bought them here.  comparable price.  You could use a 20% off coupon at Bed, Bath and Beyond and get a good price too but this is more convenient.</li>
    <li> I use a new toothbrush every two months.  Ordering online with Amazon insures I have a new, high-quality brush when I need it.</li>
    <li> This is better than a standard toothbrush, provided it&#x27;s used correctly.  The brush does the movement: one need only hold the vibrating head up to each tooth, front and back, with very little pressure.  Used like this, each brush should last about two months, if used twice daily.  Bear in mind that this is designed for a person who has no gum disease, no periodontal problems, because it does not massage the gum line.  (There are brushes that do this.)  So if you have a good set of teeth, have been to a dentist recently and received a good bill of health, then this is a good choice for you.  If you are like many people, though, you may need a bit more sophistication in your toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I wish I had never bought this model of Sonicare.  It works great, but the replacement heads are far more expensive than on other models.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare toothbrush is the best, and the Amazon subscription for replacement heads is perfect.  I never have to think about finding replacement heads.  You get as many as you want and schedule delivery whenever you want.</li>
    <li> I am taking one star off my rating because of the packaging. This box was sealed up very, very tightly, and the brush heads were lodged inside so firmly that I had to cut, slice, and tear the box to pieces to get them out. HARDLY frustration free. I&#x27;ll try the normal packaging next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, everything seems fine. I was afraid I had damaged one of the brush heads in the struggle to get it out of the package, but so far it works. OK product, bad packaging despite the promise otherwise.</li>
    <li> works like they should. These are authentic and I am very pleased with how well they are working and have lasted.</li>
    <li> Wish they would getter harder brushes like in the beginning.</li>
    <li> Not the newest model.  Heavier than my last Sonicare.</li>
    <li> The difference between the REAL thing and the generics is amazing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on generics for this toothbrush.  They don&#x27;t last and are not as effective at removing plaque as the ones by Philips.</li>
    <li> Nice head replacements for the older models.</li>
    <li> We picked some replacement brushes at the store and did not pick up the right kind.  My teeth just weren&#x27;t getting clean.  Once I bought the right kind, which arrived very quickly, the sonic care worked good as new.</li>
    <li> Gotta get the real deal and not those cheap aftermarket brushes.  These work and work well.</li>
    <li> These replacement brushes work well. Expensive, but effective.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s painless to change the brush heads out when needed. It&#x27;s nice that they come with the plastic cover to cut down on germs if you leave them out in your bathroom and protect the bristles during travel.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are fabulous. Previously, I chose to try out a store brand knock off replacement head. It was horrible. Waste of money. I saw these and instantly bought it as there is no plastic packaging!! Hooray for simple packaging.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my Sonicare brush and good price for two.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend them. Would buy again. Four more words, ok?</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare brush is a good one to keep my and my family&#x27;s teeth clean. The replacement heads from amazon are great -I get them on subscribe and save, and the packaging isn&#x27;t that awful plastic stuff that is impossible to open. Hurray!</li>
    <li> Good price for replacement brush heads for my Sonicare toothbrush.  Good to have on hand for replacement.  Love my Sonicare!</li>
    <li> In theory, it is hard to say &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; about new toothbrush heads, but I guess I went too long without replacing mine.  I really do love these.....  Lol</li>
    <li> There is not much to say about refills except that they fit the handle I purchased and were a reasonable price for the item.</li>
    <li> The heads need to be soaked in peroxide every month or so to prevent &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; from accumulating and growing. Other than this simple hygienic detail a good electronic toothbrush. Also Phillips wants you to change it way more often than necessary. Encourages this with the scheduled buyer discount program. Don&#x27;t be fooled. Change when you feel like it!</li>
    <li> What can I say, this is the same product as what came with the original tooth brush.  The mechanics don&#x27;t wear out, but the brush like any needs to be replaced periodically.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for sonicare!</li>
    <li> We have used Sonicare toothbrushes for about ten years. My wife and I are on our second power units, because we wore out the other ones. Since these brushes are from Sonicare, they fit perfectly and work like the original ones. My hygienist commented on how little plaque was on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Very good replacement heads, good price. Long lasting and simple to install.</li>
    <li> Shipped nicely. Happy with product.</li>
    <li> Work great and price was right.</li>
    <li> Having a hard time finding these anymore. I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare for 12+ years now and it still works great!</li>
    <li> I like it but my wife does not. Its too powerful.  I think this toothbrush is not recommended for older people</li>
    <li> We got hassle free packaging on these bad boys and not only did we not cut ourselves opening it, but we helped to recycle the entire packaging. Our teeth are sparkling clean and our planet is dying a bit slower now.</li>
    <li> I got these because I bought the tooth brushes and wanted extra brushes. The brushes are excellent. For me, I don&#x27;t like big brush heads. These are a good size.</li>
    <li> Have been using these for years.  Much better than the knockoffs.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is a great toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been using them for years. You don&#x27;t need bells and whistles, though. This one is just fine.</li>
    <li> Easy to keep fresh toothbrush heads on the Sonicare when I use the auto-order system. Convenient and good pricing. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item more than once!  I keep re-purchasing because Amazon is the best place to shop for items such as this.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great, the packaging sucks.  Very much afraid I&#x27;d ruin the brushes trying to unpack them.  With no instructions to &amp;#34;Open Here&amp;#34;  I didn&#x27;t have the slightest idea if I was cutting into the sensitive parts at the bottom of the brush.  If not such a good buy, I&#x27;d never buy them again because of the packaging.</li>
    <li> Sonicare E-style is the most effective and most durable tooth-cleaning system I&#x27;ve seen (although I admit I&#x27;m intrigued by the new blizzident system). I&#x27;ve had the same handle for more than 10 years (unlike the other Sonicare systems, it has no moving parts beyond the on-off switch, so there is nothing to wear out). But, you do need to change the heads several times per year to get the best use out of the system. Subscribe and save, coupled with the less expensive packaging, is the best way I&#x27;ve seen to get new heads (plus a gentle reminder that it may be time to change to a new one).</li>
    <li> I love my Eseries Sonicare and Subscribe &amp; Save is awesome. The frustration free packages, omg!! Every product needs to offer this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare brand electric toothbrush for about 15 years, and in that time I&#x27;ve only had to replace the whole device once, about two years ago. I use these replacement brush heads until they stop functioning, that is, when a fully charged battery will barely make the brush head move. For me, that&#x27;s about every five to six months, not the three months the company recommends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed over the years the price of these heads just goes up, up and up, and they aren&#x27;t always easy to find in my local drugstore. I was happy to find them here on Amazon at a reasonable price and in a much more user-friendly packaging, an easy-open cardboard box rather than that horrible clamshell plastic!</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicare  brushes for years and am totally satisfied.  These are perfect replacements.  You will be glad if you switch to Philips Sonicare.</li>
    <li> It is a convenient way for us to receive the replacement brush heads.  Whenever, we receive the replacement we replace the old ones with the new ones automatically thinking it is time to change.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are quite comfortable unless you have sensitive gums. We have been buying them for several months and plan to continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I bought the electric brush and i have no choice. this is the one it fits and I have to buy.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for years and am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Beware of imitations - don&#x27;t try and pick up the generic copies of this product as the performance disappears and its almost a standard toothbrush. This genuine Sonicare heads generate the expected amplitude and frequency for a performance thats on spec.</li>
    <li> these brush heads seem quieter than my older replacement units. I love how clean my teeth feel when i use sonicare and I LOVE the easy-to-open packaging. thanks for making a great product even better!</li>
    <li> The heads are exactly like the original one but half the cost if purchased at local store.  This will be my source as long as I can find them here!</li>
    <li> I bought the Sonicare quite a while ago (do not remember exactly when) and I think it does a better job than a regular toothbrush especially when you are unable to brush your own teeth as I am unfortunately. In a nursing home it&#x27;s hard to get someone to do a good job on your teeth. At least this one runs for three minutes on a timer.</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get.  This is a great replacement for your toothbrush.  It&#x27;s easy to take off the old one and put this one on.</li>
    <li> And these replacement heads work great.  My teeth feel super clean after using them - especially when I break out a new brush head.</li>
    <li> Great product. The price is usually the same at Walmart, but normally I cannot find the smaller brush heads. Amazon saves me a trip to the store every 5-6 months.</li>
    <li> I rarely take the time to do reviews but felt the need on this one. There is no comparison from generic store brand and manufacturer brand. Besides being much quieter and smoother sounding, the cleaning difference isn&#x27;t even close. Some things I will pay extra for THE brand and this is one. Great price on amazon for 2. Buy them...they won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> I ordered these at a very good price and I am very happy with them!  We have used this toothbrush for years and are happy with the product overall.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement!  These have been a regular item that we have used as replacement when needed and the proper intervals.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for couple of years, except a little expensive, it is pretty good, worked as expected.</li>
    <li> My wife loves her E series Philips brush! She loves more being able to get replacement brushes at Amazon. Exact fit, sealed and factory fresh in a commercial grade box.</li>
    <li> used this for years, thank you for supplying the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> The packaging was hassle free. I always buy a couple of replacement brushes since they only last me about 1 1/2 months max 2.</li>
    <li> Delivers vibration to my waiting gumline way better than the generic replacement. Save money elsewhere by not visiting the candy store.</li>
    <li> fit my e series handle perfectly, no problems.smaller than the original brush head, but feels stronger and more effective, easier to reach those back teeth. packaging solid. will buy again...</li>
    <li> The fit and were the same as the original brush heads that you can buy in the stores.  It came is very basic package - not the plastic blister packaging you are used to - but just as good and cheaper!  There is a larger 8-pack that comes in a plastic blister pack that is a better deal though.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the Philip&#x27;s Sonicare and i&#x27;ve had one for about 10 years.  The replacement heads are expensive so I&#x27;m glad I found these no-frills packaging heads for much less than I&#x27;ve seen them in the stores.  They are the exact same heads only with about $10 less packaging.  I used Amazon Prime shipping so they shipped for free and I had them in two days.</li>
    <li> Looking for a more reasonably priced brush head replacement for your Sonicare? These are perfect. Come freshly boxed and wrapped individually in a frustration free package. Fits perfectly in my Sonicare and got my teeth perfectly clean! :)</li>
    <li> Your mouth simply feels cleaner after using this product when compared to a conventional tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads are a little pricey but well worth it.</li>
    <li> The E-series heads have been kind of hard to find in stores for a few years now. Sometimes it seems like the prices have been artificially marked up as well. I&#x27;ve tried using the generic brand heads and they are truly awful considering they&#x27;re only slightly cheaper. This Amazon system with the easy package is great. No price gouge either.</li>
    <li> I have never had luck with the off brand heads for my SonicCare eXXXX.  The name-brand ones are the way to go, and these were priced decent (but these heads are always a huge rip off)</li>
    <li> Clips on easily with magnets. Soft, great grooves, will update soon when I go to my dentist and hopefully get the all clear signal.</li>
    <li> Ever since the company universalized these heads, they just don&#x27;t fit as well as they used to. Very disappointed in the new standard of quality but they still clean better than a standard toothbrush. I just wish the price would go down because their product quality has also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a sonicare since I can remember and is still the best.  I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are cleaned if I don&#x27;t use it.  But they have reduced the quality of the brush, obviously to sell more, but mine only lasts like 2 months I think, and they aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
    <li> There really isn&#x27;t much to say about Sonicare Brushes: once you&#x27;ve tried them (for us, it&#x27;s been over 10 years), you&#x27;ll never go back to a regular toothbrush or anything but Sonicare. Well some of you might, but I need MY teeth to last a long, long time, and these brushes massage the gums without bruising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, too, am pleased that Sonicare changed the packaging. The old pack of two came in plastic that needed special tools to open. Now, they come in the shown box, and just pop out. No muss, no fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: To those of you who \\&quot;subscribed\\&quot; to get two brushes every 6 months and haven&#x27;t received any lately, the old packaging has been discontinued and, evidently, the brush model as well. These are identical to the old brushes, but you might have to re-subscribe.</li>
    <li> These are way overpriced. I should probably just go back to using a normal toothbrush. I hate having to pay for these every few months. Seems wasteful too.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have the box or paperwork on my Sonicare toothbrush anymore, all I knew is that it was an &#x27;E series&#x27; model. The literature I read on the internet was suggesting that there are several different types of replacement heads for an &#x27;E series&#x27; brush. So I felt like I was taking a gamble buying the replacements, not knowing if they would work. But as it turns out, they fit perfectly and work just fine so I would recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> These items were exactly as expected and the no nonsense packaging is nice as well. I was a bit surprised that these were still as expensive as what I found locally. I guess the real bonus is being able to set it up on auto-order... but I&#x27;m too paranoid to do that.</li>
    <li> I love my toothbrush.  It is rather old so I can only find these replacement heads online.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who has the tendency to brush too hard.  My dentist recommended it to a few years ago when she saw I was wearing the tooth enamel away with my brushing.  No more problems and I actually get a better teeth cleaning with it than my old standard toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Sonicare toothbrush for a few years now. A few recommendations I&#x27;d make:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My wife and I share a base and each have our own brush heads. So we subscribe through Amazon and get a pack of these delivered every three months, per the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations. It saves me a little money, and doesn&#x27;t require me to keep track of the intervals between buying these. In the past, I have gone 4 months or so, but I do not recommend this. Anything over 3 months, and brush just doesn&#x27;t have the same effectiveness. Of course if you&#x27;re not sharing, you can cut that to every 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Go with the frustration free packaging. As of this writing, the pricing is nearly identical. The packaging is just as secure and robust, and it will indeed save you some frustration when you need to open these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The pricing on this brush system is the razor blade (or inkjet printer) pricing model. That is, the majority of the cost of ownership is in the supplies (brush heads), not the initial item (the base). Just be aware of where your money is going to be spent.</li>
    <li> Good price works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great price... fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I was given a sonicare as a gift last Xmas. I purchased new brushes. When I put the new brush on it wobbled back and forth. It wasn&#x27;t secure at all. I contacted customer service stupidly thinking they would simply replace it. They told me that I needed the sales receipt. I explained that I didn&#x27;t have the receipt because it was a gift. Well too bad for me. They refused to do anything at all for me. So I guess I&#x27;m stuck with a sonic care that won&#x27;t work. The company didn&#x27;t care at all. It&#x27;s too bad they lost a good customer. Without good customer service, eventually there won&#x27;t be any customers. Waterpik here I come.</li>
    <li> I bought a set of &amp;#34;Equate&amp;#34; look alikes at Walmart; they were not. These are the real deal. I also like the no hassle packaging.</li>
    <li> I bought a few of the less expensive ones, and these are definitely WORTH THE EXTRA COST.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re much better quality and feel better, plus they last longer.  the idea is use sonicare for your dental health...don&#x27;t skimp...get the original refills from Philips.</li>
    <li> That says it all!  Nice to have a spare in storage and not have to wait until I am at the store.</li>
    <li> Yes love them!! I use soap and this and my dental check up are perfect! Google Dr Judd  secret of good teeth birth to death&lt;br /&gt;or just Dr Judd brush teeth with soap.. they do sell tooth soap on line but I just use either dr bronner&#x27;s soap or ivory I had to stop using fluoride due to health issues.. its not good for anyone speically those of us who cant detox since we have mthfr issues.</li>
    <li> Ths was a replacement.  We have replaced these a number of times. They work well. The dentist recommended Sonicare toothbrush..</li>
    <li> I have these on subscribe and save, since I am always needing to replace brush heads on my toothbrush. I travel frequently, and so it&#x27;s nice they come with a travel cap for the brush head. I would recommend, and so, I think, would my dentist.</li>
    <li> This thing cleans great. I have had noticeable improvement at the dentist&#x27;s office since using the Philips Sonicare brushes. Just note that Philips has manufactured these brush heads with little durability, so dropping it even a short distance could result in a completely unusable brush head. Given how expensive they are to replace, this is a big negative. That said, I think that purchasing the Sonicare set will really help anyone&#x27;s dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> As usual...Sonicare products do not disappoint and the Replacement Brush Heads are no exception.&lt;br /&gt;Used for typical brushing the product cleans teeth well enough my hygenist has little work to do when I visit the dentist for a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;When up against tooth braces and appliances - the Sonicare brushes are durable to last at least three months without obvious wear.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I have registered for auto order and delivery every 6 months. First, they increased the price. Price on other sites is still same. Second, the head of one of the brush head comes off and is loose.I don&#x27;t want to get into hassle of returning and then waiting for replacement but definitely cancelling my auto order.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older Sonicare with this new model. I liked the older unit much better. Maybe I should have been suspect of the&lt;br /&gt;low price. I guess the old adage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; applies here. This new model just feels cheap and lacks the internal 30 second interval timing. It may take some time to get used to but for now it is not comfortable in use.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes.  Tried generic ones at one time and they were terrible.</li>
    <li> Very convent purchase and handy for my traveling at the time of purchase. Great job and good price cant complain.</li>
    <li> Fits well does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I tried buying a generic brand of the replacement brush heads.  They were horrible!  Each made an unbelievably loud noise when turned on.  Don&#x27;t even consider buying generic.  Buy this Philips Sonicare replacement brush head set.</li>
    <li> Our family goes through many of these brush heads for the most amazing tooth brush ever. Thank you for providing economical packaging that saves money and is easy to open. Will definitely purchase again. They have a new customer for life.</li>
    <li> I urge you to NOT buy these!!! They&#x27;re not real Sonicare. The brush head won&#x27;t fully screw on -- there&#x27;s a gap and it&#x27;s so loud and rattles when in use. Also, the ink used to print &amp;#34;Philips Sonicare, etc.&amp;#34; on the actual brush head is raised, bumpy, and not clearly printed. It just screams knock-off. I trusted the good reviews for this product and I am SO confused as to why there are so many!! Look at all of the recent one-star reviews to see how others are complaining about the same thing as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed with how this turned out and will never buy replacement brush heads from Amazon/POMO Associates again! I only trust buying them from the store now (Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Target have never done me wrong). The absolute worst thing is that my gums hurt during and after brushing -- even the next morning they were still sore. My gums even bled and got cut in certain areas!!! Probably because these horrible bristles are not as soft (definitely not legit Sonicare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so incredibly mad that I wasted my money on these. I can&#x27;t return them because I already used one of the brush heads and threw out the packaging. Now I quickly need to go buy the real kind of brush heads from a store. Please, don&#x27;t waste your money and hurt your gums like I did!</li>
    <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to pay the extra cost of packaging with marketing all over it, or the annoying shrinkwrap packaging that makes it difficult to open the product.  This was simple, in a recyclable cardboard package, at a good price, that works well with my model of Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Purchasing the replacements this way is cheaper. No need to get them individually wrapped.</li>
    <li> I Have been using Philips Sonicare HX7022/30 Eseries Standard tooth brushes it seems like forever and I will continue to use them for as long as they stay on the market.  Since Sonicare first introduced this tooth brushing system, I get Superior checkups.  Yes, I&#x27;ve been a faithful user for years.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The product is a perfect fit for the toothbrush.  The bristle strength is adequate. I would recommend the product and the auto refill.</li>
    <li> They are very good, brushes very well, and can be easily cleaned, it is good to have spare parts in case you lost the brush, the only thing i did not like is the very high price of this part.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery and a quality product! I like that they remind you of your subscription and give you an option to change it.</li>
    <li> The brush heads for the Sonicare e-Series electric toothbrush are visibly angled for better reach within the mouth, providing a thorough every day clean, while massaging and stimulating gums.</li>
    <li> Best price around. Work just like they should. Last just like they should.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this all the time and loves it. He has had the brush for years, we just return to buy new brush heads.</li>
    <li> What can I say..they fit my toothbrush and they work! Can&#x27;t ask for more! I didn&#x27;t subscribe..maybe I should have.</li>
    <li> ...And when I can, they cost just about the same.  These are the original manufacturer replacement heads - buy these, not the knock-offs.  Remember, you get what you pay for....!</li>
    <li> We received our replacement brush heads and they are as good as the ones we have received in the past. We have used a Philips Sonicare for years and don&#x27;t feel our teeth are clean with using this.</li>
    <li> These heads are perfect replacements for the Philips Sonicare.  My husband loves his Sonicare.  These replacements last for a while.  You are supposed to replace your heads every 3 months.  These will last you atleast 6 months.  Not a bad deal.</li>
    <li> The replacement brush heads for the Sonicare fit really well and last very long. I love this product, no complaints here.</li>
    <li> Have had my sonic care for about two years now. Won&#x27;t ever go back to manual tooth brushing. You should try it! these last 3 months each, sometimes longer depending on your habits. I&#x27;m cheap so if it still feels like the job is getting done I might go an extra month on these brush heads. But the whole Sonicare experience, for me, was awesome. Really reviewing the whole unit not just the brush heads.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the real thing.....never buy a generic. Especially if your over 40 fighting aging gums!</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s price for the replacement heads is much better than my local pharmacy. Quality is high and delivery is prompt.</li>
    <li> These replacement brush heads are exactly what is described by the seller.  They are not cheap knock offs.  For the price I think the replacement brush heads are a great deal. Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> the items are as usual perfect and they are a great value. The reorder feature is always right on time.</li>
    <li> so I don&#x27;t have to go hunting them down when I need to replace them.  I used to have to run to several drug/discount stores to find them in stock, at whatever price.  This is so convenient and now I find many things I can order with subscribe-and-save and get the 15% discount on the items I order, on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This is a great replacement head for the Sonicare e series toothbrush. The angled stem on this head makes it easier to use. The materials are of the finest quality. I&#x27;m sure that you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this new replacement head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for about 2 years now, and I can say that they are awesome. They do last more than 3 months but I like a new fresh head atleast every 3 months. Always come in great packaging and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great product. Original item and lasts longer. Fast shipping.Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I have had Phillips Sonicare brush for years and it was recommended by my dentist to get one. He was right, it has helped with plaque control on my teeth and I have a better checkup every year. I don&#x27;t dread seeing the dentist and having my teeth cleaned.</li>
    <li> Since switching to my sonicare I have had better oral health and cheap dentist visits. I recommend it to everyone. These heads are not super cheap but they last and this is the best value around if you buy on Amazon. Have ordered them multiple times and will keep coming back!</li>
    <li> Exactly what you wanted--real Sonicare brushes at a less outrageous price than local stores. The multilayer, corrugated box strikes me as overkill, but maybe that&#x27;s what it takes to protect the brushes in shipping. My Sonicare is going strong after 7 years, and these help keep the cost down.</li>
    <li> It was nice to be able to order these online and they fit my tooth brush perfectly. They work great!</li>
    <li> Okay what else can I say, they work, and are nice, really, what else can be said about this product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Overpriced everywhere, but they get away with it because they work so well.  Teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush heads. Nicely packaged and shipped quickly. Very pleased with this purchase. Works well with my Sonicare which I have owned for years.</li>
    <li> These are great! Easy to order. Fits our old unit perfectly. When I need more I will order again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These brushes worked very well.  I did think they were a little expensive.</li>
    <li> The price is a bit steep for these two replacement brushes, but I like my Sonicare and these are necessary.  They&#x27;re easy to take on and off and convenient to store against the side of my metal medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Overpriced refills, considering the cost I bought a different (newer?) Soniccare toothbrush and expect it to pay for itself in a year when copared with these brush heads.</li>
    <li> I bought these replacements after originally buying the knock off brand from a dept store.  There is a huge difference between the Phillips brand and the knock offs.  The original is 100 times better and worth the extra money.  Plus these come in an easy open box that you can recycle.  I will be buying these again.</li>
    <li> These OEM replacements work just like the one that originally came with the toothbrush. The price for each is about twice what you&#x27;d pay for a regular good toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acrylic cover for it tends to form a very thin amount of mold over the time and you MUST clean it. My solution is NOT to use it, instead of it I simply dip the toothbrush into alcohol 50/50 with water in order to get sanitized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom part also, if you don&#x27;t clean every week or so, it&#x27;ll get mold as well. Since it&#x27;s a moisturized place...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s kind of though having mold on something that&#x27;s supposed to clean, but that&#x27;s not a discussion to be made here.</li>
    <li> This is a great replacement brush head. I use it on my Sonicare E series. It was priced very reasonably.</li>
    <li> Fits our sonicare e-series perfectly.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are nice</li>
    <li> Excellent replacements. Fits well, and lasts for a while.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy this again.. Made too much noise and allowed tooth paste and water to enter around rubber gasket.</li>
    <li> Overall, the Philips Sonicare E-Series has been a very reliable item. Finding or locating replacement heads for the older models has become more challenging as the company rolls out new product lines and discontinues older items. I was happy that I could find these and they came packed in a VERY easy to open box. They were also VERY well protected as the box was well reinforced to prevent it from any damage or being crushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this model replacement head until my unit dies. My previous Sonicare model lasted over 8 years. This replacement head is the one I will come back for. I had ordered some from a well know auction house online (EB) and the items arrived \\&quot;new\\&quot; but were damaged in the process. There was no protection plans, or customer service staff that would help. This is or never has been an issue with Amazon. I love the way Amazon Staff takes care of anything purchased from them! No matter what, they always seem to make it right and have been know to toss in a bonus as a gift too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These heads are worth the money as I would rather pay for a great toothbrush and replacement heads than pay a dentist for pain....</li>
    <li> Great book decent price.  Would buy again as needed as the product is good.  I recommend!  Love the tooth brush.</li>
    <li> So, in an effort to save some cash, I bought the store brand replacement heads for my e series toothbrush. They were terrible. They didn&#x27;t vibrate as they should, and were crazy noisy. I immediately took them back and just ordered these instead. They work as they are supposed to, and it is a little cheaper to get them from Amazon than at my local retailer.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is a good product and I&#x27;m glad that I started using it. However, the replacement brush heads almost make it prohibitively expensive. This particular set on Amazon was less expensive than most.</li>
    <li> These &amp;#34;Philips Sonicare HX7022/30 Eseries Standard Replacement Brush Heads&amp;#34; work really well with my Philips Sonicare tooth brush, cleaning teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> We love our Sonicare 2-pack we ordered from Amazon, but the heads started to get a little worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement pack gave us &amp;#34;his and hers&amp;#34; for both our brushes, and work just like the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both got great comments at the dentist, and I would not trade my Sonicare for anything!</li>
    <li> These brush heads work great and last a good long time. The sonicare system works great and my teeth feel so clean!</li>
    <li> Beats the traditional toothbrush by a mile. Even though it is an entry-level product it does what is suppose to. Recharging is easy, cleaning it the same.</li>
    <li> Have used these brushes for quite a while.  They stand up well in the electric tooth brush and are nominally priced.</li>
    <li> Items received were proper and do fit my electric toothbrush.Price is reasonable however, I also intend to purchase the larger package of replacement brushes when the time comes which will be more economical for me.</li>
    <li> New in box - we signed up for regular shippments to keep replacements stocked when we need them.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Sonic toothbrush heads. They&#x27;re everything that I expect in a Sonic product and more! I would recommend this product to anyone that is even thinking about a mechanical toothbrush. Very easy to install very easy to detach. I love that it is magnetic, except that it sticks to everything that I don&#x27;t want it to lol, but that&#x27;s the joy of magnets you can just get whatever is attached to the magnet off simply and easily.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and looked, felt and functioned as advertised. No complaints. Hopefully it lasts. I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> We enjoy the Sonicare toothbrush and finding a refill service to subscribe to was an added benefit. Good product and great service.</li>
    <li> Maybe its just me but these heads don&#x27;t seem to last nearly as long as they used to. Currently im swapping these heads out roughly every 35 days as they begin to lose their effectiveness.</li>
    <li> These heads are just like the ones that came with my brush originally.  They work just fine and I have no problems with them.</li>
    <li> was a little worried I didn&#x27;t order the right ones but they work great and we love them&lt;br /&gt;was a bargain</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrush.  The dentist says our teeth are 95% cleaner now!</li>
    <li> It is the only toothbrush I buy after trying a generic at Walmart and throwing it away after two days of struggling with it to work. Nothing better than the original that works perfect each and every day, month after month, year after year, until it dies... hopefully not for a couple of years more I hope.</li>
    <li> Very good price, quick shipper, I love this toothbrush and am glad I can now find the replacement heads economically</li>
    <li> Stick with the OEM heads. I tried the store brand for this replacement head at Bed Bath and Beyond and it&#x27;s an inferior quality.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare has been part of my daily routine for several years and the results are clear when I visit the dentist.  Replacing the brush heads are a vital part of that regimen and these replacement brush heads are exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> These kind of ultrasonic brushes are the best thing you can do for your gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Improved my oral health dramatically since I started using them a few years ago.</li>
    <li> Sometimes shipments for tooth brush heads are better than others. Once in awhile the brush head bristles are coming out of the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Nice! Thank you for hard to find item.</li>
    <li> The product fits perfectly, has easy open packaging and fits right on. The only thing that discourages me from buying immediately is that there seems to be an awful lot of waste when replacing with a new bristle.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say much about toothbrush heads, but they work as expected.  Would certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> These arrived in that nice minimal easy to open packaging.  This is the second time I have ordered them and plan to order on a regular basis.  Both orders have been exactly what I wanted at a good price.</li>
    <li> love them. I have had the original tooth brush for 9 years and it is still working great. .yes,  yes</li>
    <li> Love the product.  So convenient to order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> It is easy to forget that Sonicare brushes wear out.  So this service to receive new ones periodically is practical and helpful.  I assume that they pay for themselves with fewer visits to the dentist. Simplification is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOM</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner. Much easier to open the box. Read the reviews from others, which were positive and agree, cheaper and as good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s recommended that these toothbrush heads be replaced every 3 months but they are quite pricey at Walmart or Target.  Buying them through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program saves me several dollars.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads fit my trusty Soniccare toothbrush like a glove, and the stress-free packaging means I don&#x27;t teach the neighbors toddler a new vocabulary as I scream and threaten the old plastic packaging before finally begging it to submit to my scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are cheaper than anywhere else I&#x27;ve found and since I keep my fingers now when I try to access the new one, I will actually replace them on schedule instead of waiting as long as possible.</li>
    <li> Have had implants for over 15 years.  The dr. told me to use this product, and I have.  Works well, and does a good job.  I am on my second one.  I don&#x27;t take it when I travel, but its amazing how I will brush my teeth automatically like I was using my Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the idea I can order them and have them sent to me and I don&#x27;t have to go out.  Subscribe and Save is a very nice way to go.No shipping, and right to your door service, when you want the products.</li>
    <li> After waiting way to long I replaced the brush head on my Sonicare. This makes it like a brand new toothbrush for a very small cost.</li>
    <li> These are the same heads that come on the Eseries sonicare from the factory only they are way less than they would cost at the supermarket. Not much to say, if you like your toothbrush then these are the exact same as what comes with it in the box.</li>
    <li> The magnets on the heads are not firmly attached. They come loose sometimes and need to be re-attached if you are changing heads frequently which my girlfriend and I do because we share a sonicare base. These are not meant for such heavy changing. I will only buy new heads from Target from now on that I know are authentic. Just bought what I know to be the real deal and the magnets appear to be glued on. They are definitely attached. These heads probably work fine if you just attach and leave them on.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had our Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes for a couple of years now and love them!  Yes, this review is for the replacement brush heads but one wouldn&#x27;t need these if they didn&#x27;t have the toothbrush so all I can say is LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I always have problems finding these in stores. I was happy to find them on Amazon and they got her fast and wrapped great too. Great price on this item for sure. If you need replacement heads check them out.</li>
    <li> Good value.  Very satisfied with this item.  These 2 brush heads are sent out to me on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I hate brushing my teeth. Hated it. Would go months without doing it. But with this. I want to do it everyday and sometimes I do.</li>
    <li> they fit my toothbrush and that is what I needed. these were on the subscribe and save option, so I have them sent every 3 or 4 months and all is good.</li>
    <li> We love our sonicare and buying these replacements from Amazon has been a great value for us</li>
    <li> This is actually the second time I have ordered with them. Prices are good, arrived pretty fast and they work perfectly fine and they are easy to open.</li>
    <li> Oem replacements that work perfect!</li>
    <li> These are really cool. They of course work with Sonicare toothbrushes. I have found that in order to keep the space between the tooth brush head and the tooth brush body from getting mildew inside it, I need to separate the two and let them dry.  The contact surface on the head (which transmits the vibration from the body to the head) is MAGNETIC!  So it doesn&#x27;t take up counter space. I just stick it on the metal rim of my mirror and let it dry.  So cool!</li>
    <li> fits perfectly,works great</li>
    <li> perfect replacement heads that work just as described. not much else to say about it besides they&#x27;re the same as the original ones that come with the hand unit.</li>
    <li> These are the same replacement heads they sell at Target and CVS, but they cost slightly less here and show up on your doorstep in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Consistently meets my expectations. I tried another vendor once and they were 2 stars compared to these. Top quality! I receive them every 4 months on schedule., so they are very dependable to have them sent when you want them.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and set these up on subscirbe and save.  That way you know when to replace your toothbrush head.  Great price, way better than in the store.</li>
    <li> Just as ordered nothing to dislike</li>
    <li> These brush heads are exactly like the ones in the store but half the price.  I will always get my replacements here! I have tried the knock offs in walmart but they are loud and just not the same as the originals.  These are the real deal!</li>
    <li> I sometimes wait too long to replace the brush heads on my Sonicare toothbrush, but when I do I can always tell that I&#x27;m using a new brush head.  Although it&#x27;s more expensive than using a manual toothbrush, I really love the feeling my gums get when I use the Sonicare with these brush heads.</li>
    <li> The brush heads are great. We appreciate the ability to have automatic mailing on a periodic basis. Thank you for this service. Ron</li>
    <li> If you use a sonicare with regular heads, this is what you need. I find it lasts over 9 months with regular use (could push it to a year). It beats rotodent brushes that my friend uses. If you use rotodent, dump it for a sonicare.. superior product :)</li>
    <li> Very good service and product. I continue to replace these brush heads as needed. Not really much more than that to say. Sonicare doesn&#x27;t disappoint when it comes to quality.</li>
    <li> They do what they say they do.  Philips makes great products and I would recommend the brush and heads to anyone who is looking for a good, tooth cleaning device.</li>
    <li> I get these through subscription.  It couldn&#x27;t be any easier, any more efficient, and the price is right! Great product.</li>
    <li> Needed replacement brush heads for my sonic toothbrush - this purchase took care of that!</li>
    <li> 2 e-series replacement brush heads; standard size&lt;br /&gt;Compatible with sonicare advance, elite, essence and xtreme series handles&lt;br /&gt;Up to 2x better plaque removal versus a manual toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Tapered, extra-soft contoured bristles&lt;br /&gt;Slim angled neck reaches hard-to-clean areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angled Neck and Contoured Bristles for Comfortable Use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an angled neck and contoured bristles that correspond to the natural shape of your teeth, the e-Series Standard toothbrush heads deliver a thorough, comfortable brushing experience. The angled neck provides optimal reach for the bristles, which have soft rounded ends that gently massage your gums and go deep between teeth to remove plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replace Every Three Months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t see it, but your brush head wears over time. Blue reminder bristles fade in color to let you know when it&#x27;s time to replace the brush head. Dental professionals recommend replacing your brush head every three months. Sonicare technology helps you remove up to two times more plaque compared to a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush Heads Screw On for Easy Replacement and Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the brush head&#x27;s screw-on design, they can be easily removed for cleaning and replacement.

    <li> Bought as gift, recipient likes them.</li>
    <li> It came on time at a good price. Very nice having the auto delivery option. This means we replace our brush heads on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This fits the brush exactly like it is supposed to. Works, no issues so far. The packaging is easy as well.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare has worked well for a number of years now. These replacements keep it fresh on the regular!</li>
    <li> I am addicted to the Philips Sonicare Eseries toothbrush. I have the refills automatically delivered so my refills are always fresh. Fresh refills are essential to well brushed teeth. I love brushing my teeth with Philips Sonicare.</li>
    <li> These little heads last a very long time (I change mine every 3 months). My teeth are cleaned 3x a year professionally and I change the heads after each cleaning. Every week or so I boil the head tip in hot water for added sterilization, just don&#x27;t submerge the mechanical components in water.</li>
    <li> With my gift card I was able to afford the brush heads.  They had been too expensive at Wal-Mart. Thank you for carrying them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> After battling some autoimmune disease difficulties (resulting in far less saliva), our DDS recommended we go to the Sonicare to salvage my teeth.  I did.  Wow -- immediate difference!  As these brushes are an essential part of the brushing apparatus, we stay with it and all continue to.</li>
    <li> I still have my original Sonicare (pre Philips) holder since the 90s.  I had a problem way back then and Sonicare replaced the handle, so I&#x27;m pleased that I can still find usable replacements since the design has changed a lot.</li>
    <li> I received my Phillips Sonicare replacement brush heads on time and securely packaged..&lt;br /&gt;It .is a pleasure to deal with such a reliable and efficient organization.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making my life a little easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C.Levine&lt;br /&gt;..</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement and quick to get.</li>
    <li> The only way to brush! :-)</li>
    <li> Great price for them both. Love Amazon.</li>
    <li> I received these every six months. Great product.</li>
    <li> What a difference in my Tooth Brush,  I need to remember to change the brush more often.</li>
    <li> Love my sonicare these were a better price than at the box store.  1st quality work great.</li>
    <li> Fits old HX7800 Elite Pro, of which I have two. One each for home and work. I&#x27;m glad they still make replacements because these old brush &amp;#34;motors&amp;#34; are still going strong.</li>
    <li> …than the other packaging with the molded plastic where you need box-cutters or some heavy duty tools to cut them open and then risk slicing your flesh on the raw edges of thick sharp plastic.  Oh yeah, and the brushes are nice too.</li>
    <li> We use this on subscribe and save to remind us when to change our heads.  They work great just like the ones that come with it and come on time with our subscription.</li>
    <li> these heads go with the more affordable body ($30-40) and these have been effective for over 20 years for the whole family in preventing plaque build up, gingivitus and periodontis. we will always use this when we can and is a good investment.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare for ever. I never have issues with my teeth and gums. I recommend pre-rinsing with Crest Pro-Health Clinical, brushing with Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil Toothpaste. And, occasionally I dip the brush in baking soda. And don&#x27;t forget the Water pick. I still have all my teeth and I&#x27;m no spring chicken.</li>
    <li> They work fine.  I&#x27;m using Sonicare Toothbrush for years and that is not my first time buying those replacement brush heads from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Replacement heads at stores are so pricey.  I&#x27;ve come :::this close::: to buying them but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend so much.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered replacements before of this but the one I currently am using...the damn bristles keep coming out each time I brush.  I suspect it&#x27;s counterfeit.  The &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; on the brush head looks suspect.  I&#x27;m not happy at all.  Be wary of this one. The funny thing is it was sold by Amazon not a other vendor.  I had to through it away.  Ugh!</li>
    <li> I like my sonicare and brush replacement is important-- the subscribe and save deal is a good automatic way for something like this -- but I do think the price increases of the items I&#x27;m  signed up for is a lot higher then ant published government index of inflation.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it should. I think it&#x27;s actually a more resilient version then the original as the interior metal lug is now sealed in plastic to prevent corrosion?</li>
    <li> Best price for these replacement heads.  Works well at keeping teeth clean and gums stimulated. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Refill brushes fit correct , best electric tooth brush ever. Makes my checkups go good. I would highly recommend .</li>
    <li> I dont use this toothbrush, but my mom does. She seems to like it. Heads came in small box in great/new condition.</li>
    <li> These are easy to replace, and they really make a difference.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare HX7022/30 Eseries Standard Replacement Brush Heads, perfect replacement heads for my sonicare toothbrush, buying in a two pack  is a great idea</li>
    <li> This is a great, necessary product as replacement heads for one&#x27;s sonicare... It is also extremely overpriced, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;The reviews from folks who have tried the generic products report low quality and therefore&lt;br /&gt;they are unable to recommend them.  Darn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to keep my teeth... but wish this product was more affordable.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. I&#x27;ve purchased these numerous times now.</li>
    <li> So glad I can purchase these on Amazon!  And the price is right.</li>
    <li> Great price and this box mesns I&#x27;m not tearing up my hands trying to get in</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I can buy these replacement heads online. They last quite awhile and work very well. I have had no problem with them.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had our Sonicare base for years and use Subscribe and Save to replace the heads. These are always consistent on their color change to signal that it&#x27;s time for a new brush.</li>
    <li> If you have a Sonicare, and I LOVE mine, you need to replace the heads every 6 months. They don&#x27;t show wear, so you need to do it on faith. I put it in my date book for repeat every six months. These are original branded heads and are good. Better deal is to get the 3-pack, however.</li>
    <li> As we were advised by our dentist to replace the Sonicare&#x27;s toothbrush heads every 6 months, we quicly found out how expensive a task this was to fulfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this deal, it was possible to maintain the integrity of the toothbrush and realize the tremendous benefits of using a Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received the order within 1 day!  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I got used to sonicare sometime age and kept with it.  My dentists tell me that helped my gums greatly.  The price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> These brush heads work with my Phillips brush and seem to last longer than I anticipated.  They work fine and the pricing is good.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads arrived on schedule.  They were exactly what I needed and I appreciate being able to get them automatically as they are needed.</li>
    <li> Everything about the order was wonderful.  I had to return the heads since my sonicare toothbrush quit (after 10 yrs), and I had to replace it with a new one with different heads.</li>
    <li> These work well.  In order to prevent the build up of mold or other life forms that like moist environments, I have learned that if I simply pop off the base that you spin to screw into the handle and store that base separately next to the brush and magnet head assembly, it allows the components to dry throughly and no mold or other growth develops for the life of the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;Before I started doing this, there something undesirable grew inside the top of the handle and in the bottom of the brush head. Do not store the brush handle and head assembled.&lt;br /&gt;If you are traveling and have to pack it away immediately, then remove the spinning base and dry the inside of it along with the head assembly with a tissue or toilet paper before re-assembling it and packing it.</li>
    <li> This is the best out on the market.  You don&#x27;t need the more expensive Sonicare system because this does a great job.</li>
    <li> Good product. No rebate given.</li>
    <li> I did not receive them!  When I do, and I have several times in the past, I love them!</li>
    <li> perfect replacement brush head for my Sonicare, very satisfied, thank you</li>
    <li> Once you get an electric toothbrush it is hard to go back to manual brushing. It&#x27;s a fact, your teeth are cleaner if you use one. Cleaner teeth &#x3D; healthier teeth &#x3D; healthier you.</li>
    <li> Have enjoyed using my Sonicare since first purchased...nice to always have replacement heads thanks to Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  I appreciated the simple packaging as well, especially since I can recycle the cardboard unlike the typical blister packaging which my city requires be thrown in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve been using an older model base (Sonicare Advance) for probably 10 years now and these replacement heads seem to work just as well.</li>
    <li> These fit my existing toothbrush fine. I&#x27;m just disappointed that they only offer a BPA free head for children, not adults</li>
    <li> Sonicare is the best toothbrush out there.  I don&#x27;t know how we ever used only standard toothbrushes for so long!  Our hygienist always says how clean our teeth are!  My husband made fun of me until I finally got him to try mine one day and he was hooked!  Ordered his immediately! lol...Great toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Nothing better than replacing the head after neglecting to change it for 6 months and brushing your teeth on a slightly worn out tooth brush head. I honestly don&#x27;t really notice that I&#x27;m brushing with a worn out head until I remember to change it and then it&#x27;s like, why am I not doing this every few months. Sure it&#x27;s still more expensive than a regular toothbrush, but I mean it&#x27;s roughly $10 for about 3-4 months of use. That&#x27;s $2-3 each month. Your teeth should be worth a lot more than that. Get your heads replaced.</li>
    <li> So much better than Oral-B THE SHAPE!</li>
    <li> I have some reservations about the Sonicare since it seems to get a bit roady inside. But these replacements were fine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say. Its a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;It fits my sonicare, that&#x27;s all I have to say about that.</li>
    <li> we got these refills as already wore out first one - went to dentist and she looked and said wow really look good - except in between teeth but life is not perfect but still good buy</li>
    <li> These are the real heads.  Good price.  Same as the originals.  Just pop the old one off and put this new one on.</li>
    <li> Only true sonicare brushes work best.</li>
    <li> I have had good luck with this item.  I have it on auto refill set up to keep them coming in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Feels like you just came from the dentist, every time.&lt;br /&gt;Probably great for gum health too.</li>
    <li> Total fraud.  I ordered this when the set actually included 3 brushes, not 2.  Watch out about this fraudulent provider.  Where can I complaint?</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, so glad I am using the automatic refill too!</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush you&#x27;ll ever use. The Essence body does use a nickel–cadmium battery. Ideally you charge these and totally discharge the battery during use _before_ recharging. Don&#x27;t sit the brush back on the charger every night! The Essence will vibrate and blink its LED when it needs to be recharged. (You&#x27;ll need a regular brush for one use during this recharge.) Using the brush like this will extend the battery life. You also need to pull the brushes off between each use, otherwise mold will grow inside the brush.</li>
    <li> They help clean your teeth!</li>
    <li> this works fine even if it is not the original !</li>
    <li> Good product/timely delivery</li>
    <li> I love the green, human friendly packaging. And the price is great too. Much better than prices and packages offered in drug stores and big box stores</li>
    <li> Expensive but necessary. I&#x27;ve used for years &amp; finally convince my son to use. He loves it &amp; feels like he has cleaner teeth.</li>
    <li> What can you say.....these are great toothbrushes, but man oh man are the heads expensive.</li>
    <li> Perfect at a great price.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as the ones which came with the toothbrush</li>
    <li> We replace these heads every 3 months or so, and it&#x27;s nice to have them on subscribe &amp; save. When they arrive, replace them.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is basically keeping the schedule for us, because otherwise we&#x27;d forget.</li>
    <li> Have been using these for years.  Always satisfied.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Came when expected.  No surprises.  Fit my toothbrush handle without any issues.  Contents were packaged securely in a sturdy brown box.</li>
    <li> I tried using the Target brand replacement heads to save money.  I didn&#x27;t think there could be much of a difference.  Boy was I wrong!  The Target heads were super loud and didn&#x27;t have nearly as much vibration as the Sonicare heads. I thought maybe it was a fluke, but we tested and compared several of the Target heads vs these Sonicare heads.... well worth the extra money for the Sonicare.  The \\&quot;frustration free\\&quot; packing is nice.</li>
    <li> I purchased a sonicare e-series toothbrush about 2 years ago and haven&#x27;t used it in about 1.5 years. Not that sonicare doesn&#x27;t make great toothbrushes it was just that I didn&#x27;t always like to wait 2 minutes for the sonicare to complete its job. Basically, it was more convenient to brush my teeth real fast with a normal toothbrush. However, after visiting my dentist recently and having a 4 cavities, a root canal, and scaling done, i figured i better break out the sonicare. These heads fit my old e-series perfectly. The only downside is that you are paying a lot more for toothbrush heads vs. a normal toothbrush, but hopefully it will save you money on dental work in the longrun.</li>
    <li> I always get my brushes from Amazon. This is a great product and it&#x27;s so hard to find the brushes sold separately. Love it!</li>
    <li> my hygienist recc replacing these w ever cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Glad I did, notice a lot more brush power&lt;br /&gt;I guess the magnets wear out???</li>
    <li> Love this thing. I have purchased this several times on Amazon. My dentist recommended this kit on a visit, but before buying in his office, checked out amazon, glad I did. Best brush ever.</li>
    <li> they work very well, but when it comes time to change to a new head the old one has a bunch of grossness inside the toothbrush that has to be cleaned out.</li>
    <li> good brush head for my sonic care. lasts a couple of months. cleaning it is pretty easy too. worth every penny</li>
    <li> These replacement heads arrived promptly, wrapped securely.  They fit my handle as well as the original brush head had.  I would re-order from this company and Amazon the next time I need replacements.</li>
    <li> Same as what you purchase in a brick and mortar store but a better price and subscribing to the shipments ensures you always have a new one on hand and change them on a scheduled and frequent basis.</li>
    <li> We have the philips sonicare toothbrush (which I recommend as well).  These replacement brushes are the correct ones and fit the toothbrush correctly.  we tried the target brand replacement ones and those didn&#x27;t work, so pay a little extra and get the right ones.</li>
    <li> If you own a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush, buy these replacement heads about every 6 months. As someone who owns the Philips Sonicare toothbrush and was looking for a cheaper option for replacement heads, I unfortunately bought an off-brand replacement head. The fit on the off-brand heads were very poor and thus they were extremely noisy and didn&#x27;t brush well at all.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time, and works extremely well.  So much better than regular brushing, sorry I did not start using it when I was younger.  You do have to get used to the brush doing the work instead of you, but after a week or so, you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> sometime ago i got into renewing agreement to have 2 Philips Sonicare brush head sent to me every two to three months.  No need to mark a calendar or put string around finger. Now when box arrives, I change out head and then remember to change again when close to quarterly cleaning appoiiintment.  i like the brush shape better than competition&#x27;s shape</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Then factor in the extra 15% off for repeat buying every 3 months and I never have to order them again. They just keep coming.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen a better toothbrush</li>
    <li> I always buys these and are always a good product.</li>
    <li> Fit great even in older sonicare. Better than generic ones bought at CVS. The generic ones are missing the guide which fits into a slot on the base to properly position the brush head.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush replacement heads are expensive, so this lower price option with frustration free packaging is a bull&#x27;s eye in terms of balancing a budget.</li>
    <li> I love the sonicare toothbrush.  It&#x27;s great to get these replacement heads online, quickly and inexpensively.  I have had no problems with the product.  This is my second order.</li>
    <li> I had a competing electric toothbrush that I was happy with, but my dentist suggest this one would do a better job.  I think I can tell that it is better and am awaiting my next visit with my dentist.</li>
    <li> Got these while Christmas shopping for everyone else since everywhere else I looked these replacement heads are double or more than what Amazon charges.  And then if you get an &amp;#34;off brand&amp;#34; replacement head, they are SOOO much noisier than these!!  They work great.</li>
    <li> These are better than the generic ones I bought last time, as you can brush your teeth quietly without waking the rest of the household.</li>
    <li> Our replacement heads arrive right on schedule. Always the right size for our units. Good report at the dentist so I believe they work great.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are great. I highly recommend that everyone get a sonicare. My teeth feel so much cleaner after each use. They also last a little longer so you can stretch out the number of times you have to buy these.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase these as we have been using the A series standard heads for years now. Those have become harder to find and if you do, they&#x27;re rather expensive. I bought these and they fit our standard handle as described. The heads&#x27; brushes are actually the same overall size as the older brushes, just contoured. I actually like this e series better. The neck is thinner - more maneuverable - and the brush is tapered to get at those tight spots between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied with the product and the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy and have no problems using it with my older essence model.  I don&#x27;t think it matters what year your model is, as long as it&#x27;s in the E series (essence) you should be okay.</li>
    <li> Product is ok but packaging is very bad. Product is not well presented. Not travelling or saving box as mentioned in description.</li>
    <li> For some reason these feel cheaper than store-bought. I&#x27;ve purchased several of these and have had reliability issues, so I went back to store bought sets and haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
    <li> Good brush with an easier open package, but I would not call it frustration free.  It&#x27;s a shame to waste the magnets each time you replace brushes.  I just can&#x27;t seem to throw them away...</li>
    <li> cheap and effective product i love it saves some cash, and its last along time if you wash it with vinegar.</li>
    <li> As expected, it&#x27;s a toothbrush! I like that it is on auto renewal and I don&#x27;t have to remember to replace every 6 months.</li>
    <li> I had been using these Sonicare brush heads for years but was buying them in a local store.  Through Amazon the cost is almost 50% less, they come in easy to open packaging and they arrive just when I need them.  A great buy and a great service!</li>
    <li> These work well, however I really wish these replacement heads weren&#x27;t so pricey. Sonicare clearly makes their money on the replacement heads. I wish there were some generic options that worked as well. Are there any?</li>

    <li> The price for these toothbrush heads are great.  The two pack for these same brush heads sells for about $25-26 at CVS, Walgreens, Walmart etc so its a no brainer to purchase them from amazon. Plus, you don&#x27;t have to spend the gas needed to drive our to the stores to buy them with Amazon free shipping and Amazon Prime.  That&#x27;s an additional savings!  Also, the packaging is great, much easier to open than the store bought variety.  All in all, its a much better value to buy these brush heads from Amazon</li>
    <li> ...as I learned the hard way.  I bought the Walmart version of these, and it barely even vibrated.  So I bit the bullet and got the Sonicare ones, and voila, it worked great.</li>
    <li> These work great! they are firm. The replacements are cheaper than the store. I would buy these replacements head again.</li>
    <li> better price than elsewhere especially when using the subscribe function. each head lasts about 4 months though a good cleaning of the parts under the hood is needed from time to time.</li>
    <li> Minimal packaging and two well price replacement heads that are exactly the quality I expect from Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best toothbrush I have ever used. I love Amazon Subscribe and Save because I always use my toothbrushes for way too long and this reminds me to change mine out regularly.</li>
    <li> The brush heads are what&#x27;s to expected, very happy with them and the price (autoship). I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Product provides two sonicare brush at a reasonable price and the delivey time frame makes the bruxh replacement a no brainer.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Sonicare. Such a great product, I will never go back to a normal tooth brush again. These replacements fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but they last a long time. They get at hard to reach places quite well, and do whiten as advertised.</li>
    <li> Quality product at a great price. The toothbrush replacement heads were as described and work prefect&lt;br /&gt;Y with my electronic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Subscribe and save makes it so easy to have a new brush head on hand.  Love this program!  Of course the heads are exactly what I was looking for to replace my used ones.</li>
    <li> the product was as described and good for the price .  It meets all of my expectations and needs and cheaper than in the stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for more than ten years, and I&#x27;ve gone through a couple of different models on the way.  My son uses the newest generation that take the smaller, less pricy heads, but my wife and I still have life in our old ones so haven&#x27;t yet switched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a cheap SOB, I love my Sonicare but hate the cost of replacing the heads every 3 months or even 6 months, so I thought I would try the generics that you can now find.  BIG MISTAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generics don;&#x27;t seem to screw on as easily, are REALLY loud when the toothbrush is in use, and have bristles that feels like they could cut diamonds.  So back to the original.  It is quiet, soft and dependable.  Some things are worth paying more for, and these are now on Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> We have spent so much money purchasing these from various retailers, thinking all the while we were getting a &#x27;good deal&#x27;.  Now, we get them as we need them, every three months, and at about half the cost. There is nothing smarter!</li>
    <li> Dentist was very impressed with how great teeth and gums looked at next cleaning.  This was the only thing we changed in our dental routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these replacement brush heads for my Sonicare several times. They work well, come in a box that is really easy to open, and are reasonably priced.  Can&#x27;t do better than that.</li>
    <li> Same thing you buy at the brick and mortar stores, only better. Why better you may ask? Better because they are cheaper and easier to open than any other purchasing option out there. Nuff said.</li>
    <li> $22.99 (on sale) for two replacement tooth brush heads?  That&#x27;s ridiculous in my book.  Sorry, not going to pay that kind of money when a regular good toothbrush can be had for a buck or two.&lt;br /&gt;Back to the old fashion way of brushing for me.  Didn&#x27;t care all that much for the sonicare brush anyway.</li>
    <li> Great replacement head!</li>
    <li> I credit my healthy gums to Sonicare!</li>
    <li> They Work as expected, and cheaper/more convenient than buying them at the store. The sonicare gives me that fresh-from-the-dentist feeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering these for a while now. The last ones were the newest version. They work just as good as the previous ones.</li>
    <li> I would have given this product 5 stars, but I think that Philips needs to come up with a product that doesn&#x27;t involve such expensive replacement brush heads.  My dentist recommended this product and it is well received by my family.  The cost however, is too much.  At least I got a good deal with Amazon.</li>
    <li> No-fuss replacements - do you need e-series replacement heads?  No frills - just a box filled with a couple of brush heads - that&#x27;s all you need!</li>
    <li> But it works! It fits in my Philips Sonicare Essential. The packaging was minimal, but kept the brush heads undamaged.</li>
    <li> You never know how old your bush head is until you get a new one. My old ones&#x27; wear stripes were long gone. New brushes are firm and doing a great job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other comments... this replacement head is MUCH louder.  Why?  IDK.  And I don&#x27;t like the green bristles.... call me old-fashioned, but I like my bristles white.  It just gives more of an impression of cleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my negative comments, I&#x27;ll still buy them again... I like saving money and even though this head is loud and ugly, it still cleans my teeth.</li>
    <li> Nice to have these available via subscribe and save, then when the new ones show up, I know it&#x27;s time to switch out the old heads.  no thought required.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare since 2001, and my dentist tells me that my choice in doing so is the main reason my teeth and gums are in such excellent shape.</li>
    <li> Great replacement heads for my Sonicare.  Love the toothbrush and the new heads.</li>
    <li> As good as the ones I buy and pay twice as much for in stores!  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> We loved these replacement brush.  They work well and was decenty priced. Also, we like the packaging, not the annoying adult-proof packaging you get at the stores.</li>
    <li> It is what it is this was a gift and have heard no complaints. That&#x27;s all I have to say.</li>
    <li> My tooth brush head works fine, but it does not fit well. when you connect the head, it&#x27;s just not stop at the center of the tooth brush, so I have to kind of turn every time I brush my teeth.... my was probably defect.</li>
    <li> Good thing is if you have a toothbrush you need to replace every 6 six months .and is save me 27% more on the Philips websize .</li>
    <li> Order them without the blister pack..........they&#x27;re easier to open.</li>
    <li> I bought Sonicare a few years ago and it cleans my teeth great. I plan to keep using it to clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> We have used the Sonicare toothbrush for years and these replacement heads get changed every 6 months or so.  We love it.</li>
    <li> Luv that they are not encased in tough plastic!</li>
    <li> These replacement brushes are amazing.  The actual electric toothbrush has some issues but these brush heads are great. They&#x27;re soft and easy to mount.</li>
    <li> Replacement for Eseries tooth brushes, works as originals, what more can I say, it&#x27;s a toothbrush head and works as it should.</li>
    <li> Amazon. is. awesome. these are the genuine article of course, and both the easy open packaging and the fact that you&#x27;re paying less than retail make this two pack a deal. And you can keep the box to store stuff and use as a travel kit in luggage. Win/win/win! :D</li>
    <li> Hassle free packaging with two perfect new heads for my toothbrush at a price far less than I pay in stores. What could be bad?</li>
    <li> Good price for the best toothbrush on the market.  I replace the heads every three months for squeaky-clean teeth.  Do you?</li>
    <li> I am not a dentist, so I cannot comment on the relative efficacy of the sonicare brush. I wish they would provide different colors to distinguish the heads, though - like blue, red, green, orange. Something other than light grey and dark grey.</li>
    <li> What can you say?  They are replacement toothbrush heads.  They work just like all of the other ones.  Shipping was very fast so definitely a good buy especially for the price....</li>
    <li> My teeth feel great when I use this toothbrush and better when I regularly replace the brush. Works well for me!</li>
    <li> I have purchased these many times for myself and my daughter.  They are perfect for our Sonicare units.  I just purchased another sonicare toothbrush and it fits that one too!  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Have this coming to house on a continuous basis and glad I do. I don&#x27;t have to remember to reorder all the time. Works exactly as stated.</li>
    <li> Great brush head for an excellant tooth brush.  Love my Sonicare!!!!  Have owned Sonicare for over a decade and would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The packing was truly frustration free. Product is good for my Sonicare eSeries toothbrush. Way too expensive for a toothbrush, but so much more better than a regular toothbrush,</li>
    <li> good value. have abrasion with my teeth as well as plaque issues so these brushes work well while still making my teeth feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Love the whole Philips Sonicare system am on my second one.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these replacement brush heads several times and they never disappoint. My dentist likes the result as well.</li>
    <li> I bought these through Amazon to go with my Sonicare HX5700 electric toothbrush.  They work just as well as the ones I buy at retail stores, and they come in cardboard boxes that are simple to open when compared to the plastic clamshells that you find at retail stores.</li>
    <li> If I have to write a bunch of nonsense then you don&#x27;t get any more ratings!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have no use for social media.</li>
    <li> My husband and i just got this product yesterday and used it for the first time today. So far we are liking it! Out teeth felt super clean and the clean feeling lasted a LONG time! We&#x27;ll see how it goes though :)</li>
    <li> These Sonicare replacement heads appear to be identical to the originals, fit well, and clean excellently.  I will buy them again in the future.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush I just absolutely love.  leaves the mouth feeling dental cleaning fresh.  Highly recommend the the toothbrush and heads.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use these in our ritual of brushing each others teeth.  I had forgotten how rough a new head is, and when my gums started bleeding, it was ON!  She now has a little skin missing from her nose, and I am without teeth.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Have you ever tried one of these?? It&#x27;s amazing!! The first ti ei used it I got chills. Better than the dentist.</li>
    <li> WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING TEETH THESE TOOTHBRUSH HEADS ARE HANDS DOWN THE TITS. THEY DO AN EXCELLENT JOB OF KEEPING MY PEARLY WHITES SPARKLING, GIVING ME A DROP DEAD GORGEOUS SMILE THAT I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR OH SO MANY YEARS.</li>
    <li> These  are great replacement heads for my E series toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been ordering them off Amazon for years with no problems.I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> they are great when your brush is damaged like mine when my puppy chewed it and it could no longer screw on to original base.&lt;br /&gt;Now it works like new.</li>
    <li> Arrived just as promised.  Needed a replacement head for my toothbrush, no hassle and a great price.  Also the box is easy to open and keep, in case you care.</li>
    <li> My Dentist recommended and is impressed with the great job I am doing on my teeth compared to before Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Love this tooth brush, and the replacement heads work really well. At the price, there&#x27;s just no beating the clean. I would highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to figure out why these cost as much as they do. I mean, it works. Get one if you want to use a sonicare brush. Would hope that the price would come down eventually, though... right? They must have covered their fixed costs at this point.</li>
    <li> It works as it should and gave no problems.  It is the same company that makes the rest of the toothbrush</li>
    <li> thumbs up on taking care of my teeth and plaque. so far good results at the dentist and less major dental work required if you stay on the game brushing</li>
    <li> These are the original design and work perfectly.  I&#x27;ve tried store brands and they are twice as loud and half the time stop vibrating if there is pressure against them from my cheek.  I also prefer the rational packaging used for these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m grateful I can subscribe and get these sent to me regularly. No more forgetting to buy toothbrushes! Nothing better or nothing cleaner than Sonicare.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and great replacement heads for the sonicare. This is a great price. You will love it.</li>
    <li> Brush heads were exactly what I was looking for, arrived at my place right on time, and in solid packaging that kept the brush heads safe. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Phillips brush heads are quality and great price.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase more in the future.  I will look for base unit to replace are old unit</li>
    <li> Toothbrushes should have brush heads replaced at least yearly, some recommend every three months. This is a basic item. High quality.  Excellent price. Bought at Amazon because I buy most household products here vs in a local store. Keep a few on hand. This is a standard item. Am very pleased. Will keep buying on Amazon. Too many neglect their teeth. I see a gym dentist twice a year and also a regular dentist twice a year. No one is too old or too young.</li>
    <li> Good quality replacement brushes. I will be ordering them again. The simple cheaper packaging is just fine and shipped well.</li>
    <li> perfect refill for Sonicare toothbrush, good price, basic easy open and recycle packaging, no sealed plastic packaging. I usually buy 2 or more packs at a time</li>
    <li> Just what we needed and what we could not find in the stores.  The sonicare system is great for teeth..</li>
    <li> I received the item very quickly. Brush heads were brand new in box. These brush heads are a lot cheaper than you find in the store.</li>
    <li> As advertised..I would do business with this seller again...</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Just what I was looking for with the Phillips Sonicare Replacement Brush Heads. Glad I found it and was happy with the price in comparison with others.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are just as good as the originals that came with the handle. They also seem to exceed the quality of the heads I&#x27;ve bought retail. Using the auto ship feature has made getting these babies a non issue, which I love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that these replacement heads still exist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Sonicare is an older model, and I was really concerned that it would be so old that the replacement wouldn&#x27;t be manufactured and available anymore for purchase. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry. And the replacement packaging is easier to deal with, not to mention more environmentally friendly.</li>
    <li> Unlike the original equipment, these replacement heads come without little rubber pads on the very bottom of the device.  As a consequence, it is so loud and irritating that it makes me want to go back to manual brushing.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRICE BY FAR. TOP QUALITY, GOT THEM IN A FEW DAYS. GREAT!! WOULD RECOMMEND YOU BUY THEM HERE AS THEY CAN BE HARD TO FIND IN THE STORES.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare HX7022/30 Eseries Standard Replacement Brush Heads are very good,I love it! It can clean my tooth very well.</li>
    <li> I love these - the price is better than any local grocery store even after any coupons are applied and the packaging is ten times easier to deal with than any store-bought sonicare heads.</li>
    <li> The frustration-free packaging was awesome! I opened the box, and they were ready to use! No annoying plastic the requires scissors or the breaking of nails/teeth! The replacement heads fit perfectly and work just like the originals. Better price than in the store and tax free for now, so I&#x27;ll continue to buy on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Needed to update my brushes as they were getting worn. Replacing them has helped the clean feeling to come back. Only fits on e series</li>
    <li> I have been using a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for over twent years and hope that I never have to use anything else. My dentist says that my dental hygiene is outstanding.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price  The generic packaging doesn&#x27;t bother me as long as it is the same product quality as the regular packaging.</li>
    <li> same as above - so much easier to order on line and save money at the same time! And no extra packaging</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love their sonicare toothbrush?  They last about 3 months for me, easy to remove and replace.  Easy to open packaging too.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as I had expected, brushes work well and mechanism is reasonably quiet. There were no problems. It arrived without delay.</li>
    <li> No sure why the whole head has to be changed instead of just the toothbrush but that is how they do it, and finding one in any store nearby is hard and/or expensive, this is how I shall do it from now on</li>
    <li> The Sonicare toothbrush, and these brush heads work extremely well. The first use leaves your teeth feeling dentist clean.  I could never go back to using a regular tooth brush.  The only negative I have about this particular E series brush head is that gunk tends to build up inside the brush head.  When you go to remove the brush head to replace it, you will see it.  I just bleach out the inside of the toothbrush before I replace the brush head and it is just like new.  This is a defect of this particular model, but it did not deter me from buying another one for my husband.  I like that I am able to save money by buying these brush heads on autoship.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Sonicare toothbrush for years, and replacing the heads every 6 months definitely helps.  These are legit Sonicare heads at a good price.  Never had any problems with these heads, and I also greatly recommend the Sonicare brand as a whole.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re perfect- they fit great and work great. I thought my toothbrush was running out of charge but it seems like it&#x27;s conducting better with a new brush on it.</li>
    <li> I spent (wasted) $24 in a brick and mortar store to buy generic replacement heads for my Sonicare E series toothbrush.  When I turned on the device, it vibrated so violently and was so loud that my housemates literally came running into the bathroom to ask what had happened to my toothbrush.  Very disappointing.  I got on Amazon and ordered the Philips brand replacement heads and not only did they arrive very quickly, when I installed one of them onto the toothbrush, it operated quietly and efficiently, rendering my Sonicare good as new.  I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough, and can&#x27;t stress the difference it makes to order the &amp;#34;real deal.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know much about sonicare toothbrushes.  I can say, though, that my teeth have never felt even close to this good since I&#x27;ve started using one.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush, by far the best rechargeable tooth brush I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year now and the only maintenance is replacing the heads.</li>
    <li> And I should have figured out that I should replace them more often than once every four or five years. I noticed how much cleaner my teeth felt and tasted after only a couple of days.</li>
    <li> These are great replacements and fit perfectly with our current Sonicare toothbrushes. I will probably sign up for them to be delivered on a regular basis and save a little money in the process.</li>
    <li> I used a coupon from Amazon to get these much cheaper than in the store. Good brush size, good price.</li>
    <li> KEEPS YOUR TEETH CLEAN</li>
    <li> best  toothbrush ever! Saved my dental work, teeth, and especially my gums....Wish i had begun using it years ago...</li>
    <li> Seems to be same as what came with the unit.  Works as usual.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I am spoiled by the Sonicare line of toothbrushes. I know it gets my teeth cleaner than were I to use a manual brush--I could definitely feel a difference after I made the switch years ago. I&#x27;m also glad that Sonicare now offers a cheaper model that takes regular batteries--although I had to switch to rechargeables, since the actual toothbrush chews through them so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing the replacement heads do NOT do, at least for me, is last 3 months. One month tops, and that&#x27;s with me being a lazy brusher. I also did not think that I was pressing too hard while using them, but within a month&#x27;s time, the bristles are frayed and the color indicator that lets you know when you should replace the heads is worn down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as some others have said, cheaper generic brand replacement heads do NOT work. They are ridiculously loud, and I can tell they do not work the way they should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing I would say is that the replacement heads are WAY too expensive. They cost more than the actual toothbrush, for pity&#x27;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So: nice product, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should and costs too much.</li>
    <li> PROS: Fits perfectly. Does a fairly good job cleaning. I tried other replacement heads (such as the Wal-Mart equate brush heads) and none with fits better than Phillips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: This design have water build-up in the brush base. Make sure you remove and clean each time. I did not do that for a while and found some nasty build-ups there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER THOUGHTS: I really want to Diamond head brush but those are not available for the e-series. From reviews and research, I see that the diamond head brush head really makes a big difference. I figure that Phillips should make an e-series version and was waiting... and waiting... and waiting... Now I&#x27;m not sure if it Phillips will ever make it available for an e-series version. Been waiting for a while and so I upgrade to the Healthy White Platinum Edition (comes with with two brush base and a UV sanitizer). This set also include two diamond brush head (which was the reason why I upgrade). I gave my e-series to my mother.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare for years, it has been proven very efficient in keeping my teeth and gum healthy. Great prices, fast shipping and trustworthy seller!</li>
    <li> Been using a toothbrush with this head for years and have been cavity free! That&#x27;s what really counts right? Always a consistent quality every time I buy the heads. They&#x27;re pretty firm bristles when you first get it and you know it&#x27;s time for a new head when the blue strip loses its color. Amazon&#x27;s no hassle packaging makes for an even easier experience. Will keep using these heads for years!</li>
    <li> They work well to clean teeth.  The price is high to replace every 3 to 4 months as they now recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicare products for many years, and always worry just a bit about ordering these replacement brush heads on-line due to a compatibility concern.  However, these work just fine with my current brush, and so I will continue to order these.</li>
    <li> Authentic sonic care replacement heads at a lower price than in the stores. This is another item I have enrolled in the subscribe and save program.  I like the fact that I know when to change my brush based on when they arrive in the mail.</li>
    <li> Works great, will buy again</li>
    <li> Had these before and they work great. I wish they weren&#x27;t as expensive though.</li>
    <li> These brush heads work great! I cannot tell the difference from the original, except for the difference in price</li>
    <li> These replacement brush heads are perfect for my sonicare toothbrush. They have the right firmness for a good brush. I can tell a lot of thought went into this product because it feels just right. Will be buying again from Phillips once the time comes to replace my tooth brush heads.</li>
    <li> To me they seem somewhat overpriced but the main issue I have with this is if the bristles go out why do they have to manufacture a whole piece with all this excess plastic that ends up just filling our landfills. A complete waste by Phillips</li>
    <li> No problems with this product. Product was as expected and as described in the description. I would purchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. The brush works great and even my dentist noticed how healthyy mouth is since I have switched. I get the brush head sent to me through Amazons subscription program and that makes keeping my teeth healthy and clean even easier.</li>
    <li> works very well on my sonicare 5 year old handle. My old brush was hardly vibrating anymore. I thought there might be something wrong with the handle. Before buying an entire new unit, I took a chance on these inexpensive heads.&lt;br /&gt;Fixed the problem! The new ones vibrate quite nicely. One should replace toothbrushes and the heads every 6 months or so. At this price, it will not be to painful.</li>
    <li> Dentist suggested I use the Sonicare electric brush to help reduce gum problems.  Have been using the Sonicare for 4 years and have had perfect checkups ever silnce.  I recommend the automatic quarterly delivery of new brushes because it reminds you to replace the brush every  3 months.</li>
    <li> Of all the brush heads for my Sonicare, these are by far the best. I get a mini cleaning each time I brush my teeth and my dentist said I need to come in for a cleaning only once a year.</li>
    <li> We have used this electric toothbrush for a long time and really like it.  It&#x27;s always nice to get the new heads on a regular basis so that we do get new ones.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than buying them at a local drugstore or supermarket!  Make sure you replace them as often as your dentist requires!</li>
    <li> It looks almost identical to my other brush, however, when I turned it on, the base is vibrating more than the brush itself.  I cannot figure out why other than there is something wrong with the makeup of the replacement brush.</li>
    <li> I have them on auto-ship One set arrived smashed by the carrier, and was replaced right away. I like the convenience of the autofill, since I wouldn&#x27;t remember to change them.</li>
    <li> They were great.  Seemed very sturdy and well made.</li>
    <li> As I said in the title, these are not cheap but they are what you need for your toothbrush, so you will buy them.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for the OEM original heads. Bristles are a little more gentle, but the build quality is identical.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare, and this subscription makes using it a breeze! I would definitely recommend this to someone in the future.</li>
    <li> We have had the Sonicare for about 6 years and have noticed that visits to the dentists for teeth cleaning have been greatly improved.  Would recommend this product for everyone.</li>
    <li> This brushes are what I expected.  They work just fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d pay more to not deal with the sealed plastic packaging you get at the stores. At Amazon it&#x27;s less - awesome! The four star rating is not a five  b/c the brush design is a bit tough to keep clean (water drips into the handle and base when charging.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been burned once and never again. Always buy the original Sonicare brush heads as the off-brand Target knockoffs make the worst rattling sound. I&#x27;ve tried multiple units and 75% of them do it. These never seem to have any issues.</li>
    <li> Bzzzzzzzzzzrrrrrrrrrraaaaawwwwrrrrrrrr. That&#x27;s the sound of Sonic-fresh breath in the morning. Works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as advertised. Fit and function is perfect.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Sonicare - nothing compares to how clean my teeth feel after every brushing other than the dentist. I highly recommend one to everyone I know. It was the best money I&#x27;ve spent in a long time. My mouth feels cleaner, longer. My teeth have since whitened... But on to the review of this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally had purchased the sonicare replacement brush heads, but I felt they were pretty pricey, so I purchased some Wal-Mart special replacement heads. Worst idea EVER. The wal-mart special replacements are loud, not even close to the same quality, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I would get the same clean from just using it manually. I am not even ready to replace my wal-mart heads, and have already bought these, which compared to local prices, is much gentler on the wallet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Buy the real thing, spend the money on the sonicare heads, unless you want to hate your brush. It&#x27;s not worth the savings, from Wal-mart or wherever, because you&#x27;ll just be here, buying the real thing.</li>
    <li> I bought these replacement Sonicare heads, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them. By ordering them through Amazon, I saved quite a bit of money from buying them retail. And according to my dentist, they&#x27;re working great.</li>
    <li> My dentist kept telling me to get this. I finally did and understand why! Makes a huge difference in the way my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
    <li> We signed up to get new toothbrush heads delivered to us every 4 months (super deal...about $9 per head), and we love them.  Since using the Philips Sonicare, our dental hygienist says that she has very little to clean when we go in for our 6-month dental check-ups. Our teeth are healthy and the brush heads are easy to attach and detach.  I also like the packaging, which is just a tiny bag within a small box --- no packing peanuts or other fill.  Great product.</li>
    <li> The feeling of a new brush is great on a fully charged sonicare....this generic version on amazon is a great deal</li>
    <li> I bought an after-market brand of replacement heads and was not satisfied.  The heads did not lock into place, so they were always somewhat mis-aligned.  During use they were very noisy.  The original Sonicare head locks into place and is very quiet.  Oh yeah, they also do a good job cleaning my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> i purchase this monthly and it works very well.  its like having a dental cleaning every day.</li>
    <li> Good Amazon price, for the usual replacement head. I get them for our family for stocking stuffers. It prompts everyone to change their brush head. Considering the chocolates in the stocking, its a useful gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few brands of electric toothbrushes, including alternative replacements for the Sonicare, but so far these have been the best at cleaning. They are slightly pricey and don&#x27;t too last much longer than the dentist&#x27;s recommended 3 months brush change guidelines, but they do clean very well.</li>
    <li> good price/good product</li>
    <li> This product does the job and saves on time when you go to the dentist. Highly recommend, professional cleaning is almost not necessary when you have this product and gum line receding halted and/or improved.</li>
    <li> These brush heads work perfectly with both an older Sonicare Elite 7500 as well as a newer Essence 5300. Subscribe and Save makes it easy and convenient to remember to swap out the old ones. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and always had great results from it. My oral hygienist recommended it and has helped keep my cleanings quick and easy.</li>
    <li> These heads fit the Sonic toothbrushes that we already had.  I really like the hassle-free packaging because you practically had to get a blowtorch out to open the old style packs.</li>
    <li> Easier to open and still a great item for oral hygiene! I&#x27;ve been using these brush heads for a year and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed!</li>
    <li> I need to replace the brush heads on my sonicare tooth brush.  These brush heads worked great, I could not be more happy with these brush heads..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush for several years, and I just love it.  There&#x27;s no comparison between manual brushing and brushing with a Sonicare.  Periodically, of course, the brushes need to be changed, so I buy these 2-pack replacements.  They&#x27;re easy to change out, and last a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction! Excellent product! Was purchased as a gift but I have this product myself. Works very well and I would very much recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using my sonicare elite for years and I love it. These brushes work great and they last a long time. The packaging is simple and easy to remove.</li>
    <li> My dentist always says that my teeth look great! I will continue to use the Sonicare system and switch out my brush head a few times a year.</li>
    <li> Design still has not improved. Toothpaste still get into the cracks and turns into mildew. These do their job and I know this is the oldest model of head, but it seems that they could address this problem.</li>
    <li> I have these shipped regularly as part of the Subscribe and Save subscription. (Coupled with Prime it&#x27;s a great bargain). I love my Sonicare toothbrush and hate going back to a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothbrush. I never feel like my teeth are as clean if I don&#x27;t use it. This 2-pack from Amazon is a lot cheaper than anything I could buy at the stores here.</li>
    <li> These fit my Sonicare brush perfectly and work great  Very well made and durable I always get great dental checkups by using these brushes.</li>
    <li> Almost perfect.  Small product design flaw: saliva gets in between brush head and brush, getting kind of gross and mucky.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I was able to purchase these brushes.  I really like my Sonicare unit.  Thank you</li>
    <li> We love our Sonicare and these brushes are fine, but they get so nasty--the brush holder and the brushes collect a dirty brown slime, requiring a vinegar cleaning and brushing.  If you take the top off to clean with a brush, eventually, the brush will no longer \\&quot;seat\\&quot; properly.  This annoying issue may simply be a drawback of a powered toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Love the packaging. Enviornmentally friendly. Works great. Dentist recommended for everyone in the family. Will buy more definitely. Love it.</li>
    <li> As advertised, replaces my Sonicare Essential heads.  I have not used them yet, but upon inspection, I see no problems occurring once I do.  The plain packaging was no issue.  Only problem I had was trying to understand the nomenclature with the models.  I had to contact Philips directly to understand it.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and quality.</li>
    <li> They work great - I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how long each one lasts. They are pretty expensive so I&#x27;m trying to make them last as long as possible. At this point, I&#x27;d say two months is a good guess for the length of time they are effective.</li>
    <li> I have used these brush heads for a long time.  My dental hygenist does too.  She says I also have a very clean mouth.</li>
    <li> Will order again. One of the metal prongs on the base broke in one toothbrush, but it is time to replace them anyway.</li>
    <li> No problems here,  Save some money an order on line instead of a brick and mortar store.  Lots cheaper here.</li>
    <li> Convenient service and affordable.</li>
    <li> They do not last as long as original ones or as the ones that used to be years ago. Even the bristle indicator doesnt show much of wear but they vibrate less vigorously. Kinda like Gillette cartridge that is perfect for 2-3 shaves but then you need a new one. Nice move Sonicare!! (not)</li>
    <li> ...but a bit expensive to be honest.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED OTHER REPLACEMENTS BRUSHES! HOWEVER ,THESE HAVE BEEN WORTH EVERY DIME.THEY HELD UP &amp; I ONLY PURCHASE FROM AMAZON</li>
    <li> Best fit.  Better than using a generic brand.</li>
    <li> new toothbrush, ahhhh.........</li>
    <li> works perfectly, love my sonicare toothbrush and these replacement brushes work great and you can not beat the price either.</li>
    <li> Works very well but the brush heads are smaller than on my old ones. I like the wider brush heads better.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare toothbrush is excellent.  My dentist sings its praises every time I go in for a checkup.  A bit pricey as compared to other brushes, but well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Using the product to clean my teeth has helped my gums and teeth very much. This is a excelllant product.</li>
    <li> love the convenience of having these delivered to my door instead of having to search for them.  I have used these for years and my dental checkups are always good.</li>
    <li> We have owned a Sonic care for many years on the advise of your dentist.  I wish I had gone for the automic delivery but next time.</li>
    <li> I understand that electric toothbrushes are the best.  These particular&lt;br /&gt;brushes are superior and do the job well and fit well on my base.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of picking up a knock-off set of brush heads (TopCare SmileSonic Replacement Brushheads) at Wegman&#x27;s recently, and my wife said of them: &amp;#34;it sounds like an airplane taking off!&amp;#34; The Philips brush heads are fairly quiet, but more importantly, the knock-offs barely felt like they were moving compared to these. Our teeth still felt filmy and unscrubbed with the knock-offs. I was able to return them, and promptly ordered another set of these (in the frustration-free packaging, which saves me some nasty cuts on my fingers).</li>
    <li> These brush heads are wonderful and they fit perfectly. They last a long time. Would definitely recommend and will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I have been using it for years.  And I like it.  It works so well for me I never need dental work.</li>
    <li> I just received my Sonicare replacement brush heads and I am quite happy. I thought I&#x27;d save money by buying Walgreens brand replacement heads but they fell far short of the excellent operation of the authentic Sonicare brushes. So, I am back to Sonicare genuine parts again and will never ever use cheap knockoffs. Thanks for a great product Sonicare! My teeth are worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I originally bought Wal-Mart replacements, and they were too squishy, and did not clean effectively.  These are just like what came on my toothbrush. Excellent replacement.</li>
    <li> Have these on subscribe and save to help force me to change my heads when I should. Otherwise I would stretch out the life of the heads which my dentist would most likely advise against.</li>
    <li> A perfect replacement for the handle I have. I could not ask for anything more. Product works as it should.</li>
    <li> We bought a new Sonicare rechargable toothbrush at the same time as an older one finally stopped working.  These brushes fit perfectly on the toothbrush and the price was quite good.</li>
    <li> These replacements are the best !  I could not find these before.. as soon as I seen them I bought them.  Thxs</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years, and my teeth are better for it. no problems with the phillips products, endorsed by my dentist.</li>
    <li> I ordered another set for my family today as it got even more cheaper. Good enough quality for the price.</li>
    <li> We had some aftermarket heads for our Sonicare that were loud and didn&#x27;t work as well. Not so with these. They perform like they should. Quiet with the right amount of vibration on the heads. Will be sticking with the ones made by Phillips in the future.</li>
    <li> With these I don&#x27;t have to search for the lowest price, cause they do it for me and since I opted for the recurring shipment I get them as often as needed. Also I get the flexibility to change my order if needed.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush and the heads that go with it, although I discovered you can purchase them for much cheaper at Costco</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, work great, amazing product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using traditional toothbrushes for a long time and when I switched to these, I&#x27;ve never looked back. The vibration sensation just does more work for you in much less time for a better clean and debris removal. These saved me a lot of time and money by keeping my teeth clean and preventing cavities and gum disease. Even my dentist was impressed with how well my gaps are doing. These things never had any issues with them and please do get these and not the cheap Target knock offs. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Frustration-free packing is the best.  &#x3D;)  Good price on the brush heads, too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what there is to &amp;#34;LOVE&amp;#34; about these.  Price was better than Wally world and shipping was very fast.  I do love my sonic care toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I use these for years.</li>
    <li> Not perfect, but it does a pretty good job of tooth cleaning.</li>
    <li> The product is good quality, but it costs too much. Save money and buy the Sonimart Premium Standard Replacement instead. It&#x27;s the same quality as the Philips brand but cheaper.</li>
    <li> Only after newer brushes come out does the price drop on these. Finally, a reasonable priced brush head for a high-quality brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Philips Sonicare for many years.  I love the polished feel it leaves on my teeth.  My gums are a lot healthier since using this product.  It&#x27;s easy to forget when I bought my last brush heads, and Subscribe and Save is a very convenient way to make sure I replace my brush every 3 months, and the price cannot be beat.  I&#x27;m enjoying a 15% discount because I order over 5 products using this service.  I get email notifications, and it is easy to postpone or cancel any order.  Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save is a very convenient service that can save you a little money as well.  No, I don&#x27;t work for Amazon! ;o)</li>
    <li> Another item I have delivered regularly - about every three months, the sonic care does a pretty darned good job of cleaning, I&#x27;d highly recommend them for anyone who is not a regular flosser, which I suspect is most of the population.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect replacements for our sonicare toothbrushes.  Love the price and they come once a month directly to our house...perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare tooth brush since it first came on the market. My Dentist noticed the improvement almost right away. In my experience, the generic heads are a waste of money. They don&#x27;t fit securely and wobble in the holder, I can&#x27;t imagine that&#x27;s too good for the base. My one experience with Customer Service was terrific. I had called them simply to ask a question and they replaced the entire system, right away&lt;br /&gt;My only negative thought is the cost. However, quite worthwhile, if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> So I bought the generic brush for my Sonicare.  It did not work!!  Ordered these replacement brushes and they worked!!  Don&#x27;t buy the generic!  And the frustration free packaging is a wonderful added benefit to ordering this way.  I also got a great deal!</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare however, the brush heads wear too quickly.  I think they are all soft heads so, for someone who brushes a few times a day the head wears quickly.  I wish they offered it in medium so it would not wear as quickly.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed at a great price!</li>
    <li> The bristles are too hard, nothing like the original one that came with the unit.  It was hard for the search engine to display the softer bristle.  It was hidden under the name of sensitive.  Therefore, I lost my money on this purchase.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really not much to say about these replacement heads if you have used a Sonicare before besides that they simply work. While there are multiple sellers online with generic brush heads I choose to buy the name brand ones because while they are expensive I know that they will work and last. I calculate how much a head cost me over its lifetime and it really isn&#x27;t all that much Plus you only get one set of teeth so its important to take care of them. I have also heard that some of the other brush heads make a loud noise when you turn them on. These fit perfect and sound just like the original ones that I got.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using sonicare for years and my dentist suggested I wasn&#x27;t changing the brushes frequently enough. In fact she was right, I wasn&#x27;t. Now on subscription order I&#x27;m always changing on time.</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best price for the eseries I&#x27;ve seen, and they save me more money on the dentist than I can imagine really.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that I automatically get replacement heads and don&#x27;t have to remember to order them.  I have used philip&#x27;s for years and am very satisfied with them.  I also find Amazon to be very reliable.</li>
    <li> I liked the price and the fact that the packaging was much easier to open.  I have tried the off-brand for Sonicare and I haven&#x27;t been as pleased with them.</li>
    <li> I love my sonicare tooth brush. These brush heads work great, and last a long time. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush just wish the replacement heads were not so expensive but it sure makes brushing your teeth more fun!!</li>
    <li> i wish more stuff came in frustration free packing like this. just what i wanted. easy to access. affordable. thank you amazon!</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old toothbrush heads and it&#x27;s getting harder to find replacements in my local stores so I found them here on amazon and ordered.  They work fine.</li>
    <li> These last a good while before needing to be replaced. They do need to be cleaned every week, but they are still superior to a manual brush.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised that these brushes have been improved.  The shaft is tilted inward and the brush is smaller, making it easier to reach all areas.  Good engineering.</li>
    <li> Great price for these expensive replacement brushes. Also the packaging is awesome. So glad it&#x27;s not clamshell packaging. a b c</li>
    <li> Great competitive price and was shipped to me really quickly!  I like that I can get two at a time instead of buying them individually at the store.</li>
    <li> Like the new packaging and product came promptly.  Works great with my Sonicare tooth brush.  I&#x27;ve had the tooth brush for about ten years and my dentist says my teeth look great.</li>
    <li> This product from Amazon.com performs well, like the original.  I had the unfortunate experience of purchasing a 3-pack from Target that had fake magnets.  I might as well have used a manual toothbrush instead.  Also, I appreciate the user friendly packaging.</li>
    <li> I have used them for a few years now and the sub. price you can&#x27;t beat and the product holds up</li>
    <li> Works great, fast shipping, thanks</li>
    <li> Easily the least expensive option out there. The E series are very hard bristle heads, so if you&#x27;re looking for something softer this wouldn&#x27;t be your choice.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much This is perfect beings I left mine in Mi.&lt;br /&gt;you were very prompt  in sending thank you so much,I was sweating&lt;br /&gt;if my charge would last till I got mine. It did.Again thanks so much and&lt;br /&gt;Merry Chritmas</li>
    <li> Love my sonicare toothbrush. These brush heads fit and worked just liked the original.</li>
    <li> I gave them as Xmas gifts to my two children.  I had just changed my brushes and found it was a lot stronger so felt they could use them.  The brushes were much appreciated.</li>
    <li> It works very well in protecting my teeth from plaque.  I would recommend the Sonicare brush and brush heads to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is always a little cheaper to get these on Amazon, and I don&#x27;t have to make a trip.  These are Sonicare brand and work like they should.  Sometimes I think I need a new toothbrush, but then I replace the head and it works great again.  Love my Sonicare!</li>
    <li> Shipped promptly. I was worried that the heads wouldn&#x27;t compare to the head that came standard with the product, but it fit and worked just as perfectly as the original. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Nothing but totally satisfied.  Solid packaging &#x3D; no damage.  Product just as described and arrived on time.  Haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet, but have confidence they are just like my original brushes.</li>
    <li> I have bought some after market brushes to save $5.00. These are so much better end quieter.. These work very well and highly recommend them and the brush</li>
    <li> fast and fits, just like it says it should.  Easier than going to a retailer and guessing when you can just check your machine in your home :)</li>
    <li> I have these on subscribe and save which is really nice. I couldn&#x27;t give them the last star because they are quite noisy. I sometimes have luck tightening the head on the toothbrush but I still get a lot of rattling with them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for years, and I have constantly gotten rave reviews from my dentist. I particularly like that these come in the frustration free packaging... two seconds to open the box and remove the brush heads, as opposed to having to fight with bubble packaging.</li>
    <li> are the result of these things. My teeth feel slick, like my car does after a car wash. I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t drive my teeth down the road - but if I did, I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;d have these to clean them. What was I talking about?</li>
    <li> Ive had this sonicare toothbrush for about 5 years now.  I replace my brush head about every 6 months. This time, the heads came is frustration free packaging which I love, they used to come in a blister pack. The heads work flawlessly everytime.  I have never had a problem with sonicare products.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t settle for gerenic brush heads, buy the best, like these.  I do wish the package was not so difficult to open.  In so far as I am concerned the packaging is theft proof (a great anti-theft tool for department or pharmacys), child-proof, and for those individuals who are disabled, yep...it&#x27;s a work out every re-order.  Thus the 4 Star rating.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that Amazon has been expanding the products that come in easy to open packaging. I can understand having items in clamshells in a physical store to help with theft, but ordering online takes that out of the picture. Now I don&#x27;t have to wrestle with my toothbrush before using it. Sonicare does a great job keeping my teeth clean and healthy and these replacement heads continue to insure they stay that way. Great product!</li>
    <li> These were the best price that i could find for these brush heads. I love the overall toothbrush and these brushes do the job.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare.  I have used this toothbrush system for the past few years and it is the only way to go.</li>
    <li> They completely fulfill their purpose -- extending the life of my Phillips Sonicare tooth brush at a much reduced cost than I would incur for total unit replacement.  Good buy, too.</li>
    <li> My teeth used to be green.  They also had a tint of brown.  They were slimy too.  Now.....the are Brad Pitt white!</li>
    <li> Brushing with Sonicare is intense. If you have tried one of the cheap (10$) electric throw away brushes and decided electric brushing isnt for you, think again. I suggest picking up the cheapest sonicare you can find.. usually around 30$, and find out for yourself how effortless effective-toothbrushing can be.</li>
    <li> Finally ordered replacements for my Sonicare... glad I did. Most places I went to sold packs of more than I needed, like Costco, or Target, then again, I really look for packs of two... maybe they&#x27;re out there. They perform well and it feels good just to have new/stiff bristles again. The magnets on my old one were deteriorated and didn&#x27;t perform well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new ones perform just like new.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any problems with these toothbrushes. They come in a box that says Phillips Sonicare but I wonder if it is generic. They work fine but it does seem like it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the ones I buy in the store.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal. Since using this product, I have had a better checkup with the dentist and hygenist.</li>
    <li> always good. I hope the company does not discontinue this item. Third time ordering this replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highyl recommending to anyone!</li>
    <li> I need new heads for my Sonicare tooth Brush so I order thePhilips Sonicare HX7022/66 Eseries Standard Replacement Brush Heads, 2 Pack and the work quit well.</li>
    <li> As I expected....came on time. i have no complaints...only compliments. Thank goodness they do not have those so hard to open plastic containers</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. The price was great. Packaged perfect and arrived in good time. Glad it was available and would recommend to anyone who is looking for replacements.</li>
    <li> I tried the sonicare brushes with the smaller heads but they did not work as well as these brushes work.  I will never go back to a regular toothbrush!</li>
    <li> With the ability to schedule the arrival, there is no more hazzle when the used brushes need replaced.  I wish more items could be scheduled or suscribed to...</li>
    <li> Does the job &amp; a great price. It might be nice to have 2 different colors for couples, but I just use a sharpie &amp; write our names on them.</li>
    <li> These are the heads for one of the original versions of this toothbrush. The price was very competitive and they perform perfectly. I will def order again.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Teeth feel very clean. Good price on replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth replacing the heads every 3 months. I waited about 5 and can tell the difference between the old and new brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy open packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for dental care.</li>
    <li> I have had my Sonicare toothbrush for about (11) years now and I love it.  The replacement heads that I received from Amazon would not fully charge, this is the only time that I have had this problem.  I don&#x27;t feel as though it had anything to do with Amazon because they were packaged as they come from the manufacturer.  I believe it was &#x27;just one of those things&#x27;.  Amazon was great about the return process and I do not have any complaints with them.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT.THE BRAND I USE HOLDS UP REALLY WELL AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, COMPARED TO THE PRICE IN MOST,I SHOULD SAY ALL STORES THAT PROVIDE THIS ITEM, AMAZON HAS THEM BEAT ON COST.THE CONVENIENCE OF THE SCHEDULED SHIPPING PROCESS IS GREAT TOO.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing these replacement heads from Amazon for several years. They fit the toothbrush perfectly and they work well. The Amazon price is the best I can find anywhere.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly. I was hesitant to order toothbrush heads smaller than the OEM ones. However, after using them, I realize that &amp;#34;size does matter&amp;#34; because I can maneuver the head, easily, around the molars without gagging. I plan to order future replacements. They are a Buy!</li>
    <li> Have been using the Sonicare toothbrush for over 18 years and this is the first time I&#x27;m on an automatic shipping schedule.  So far, I love the fact that I won&#x27;t be caught without a new brush head when needed (like I did last month).  Also, the fact that they come to you in &#x27;frustration free packaging&#x27; is great......I hate those hard to open heat-sealed packages; I always end up with a cut on my fingers from opening that hard plastic.</li>
    <li> Love this electric toothbrush!  Love the ease of getting replacements.  Have had excellent checkups since started using Sonicare. Buy now!</li>
    <li> I received these two replacement brush heads in impeccable condition.  I have begun to use one, and it feels like the very first time I used my Sonicare!</li>
    <li> I purchased my Sonicare years ago.  I&#x27;m glad they still make replacement brush heads for it.  I wish they would make the bristles just a little softer.  That&#x27;s my only request.</li>
    <li> In trying to write a serious review about a product that does what it should do very well it is hard not to make jokes at risk of sounding too cliche. I am extremely pleased with my new brush heads. They are hard to find and I found them here at a great price. I am writing this &#x27;sparkling&#x27; review and giving 5 stars because I am happy with my product and the prompt delivery after ordering. As with anything, I would love to have paid less, but it is what it is and that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I purchased these replacement heads for my husbands toothbrush and they work perfectly.  The packaging they arrived in was easy to get open, which those of us with arthritis greatly appreciate.</li>
    <li> Most grocery stores won&#x27;t carry these expensive replacement brush heads so I have to purchase them at a local pharmacy - where everything is more expensive. Every 6 months I replace my brush heads and this time I purchased them online. It&#x27;s the same OEM brush head but much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Thank you Sonic Care, for using better packaging.... is it made from recycled materials?  That would be super excellent.  Also, we love the subscription option. Very, very convenient and has always worked well for us.</li>
    <li> Seem to not last as long as they should</li>
    <li> These are for eseries like the are supposed to be for. The brush heads look a bit better than the ones I got when I bought the tooth brush. So these might be updated or just better than the original.</li>
    <li> After buying a Sonicare I&#x27;ll never go back to a manual brush. These replacement brush heads are easy to attach. Plus you get 2 in a pack which is convenient.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I buy this every Christmas as a stocking stuffer for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I do not know much about electric toothbrushes, but I got the Philips one because it was the highest rated and I guess it is the best because my teeth have not fallen out my head after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the replacement heads.  I guess they do their job in that they are a replacement, and heads and attach to the heavy part of the Philips toothbrush, which I guess is not so replaceable by means of purchasing replaceable heads, except to buy a replacement toothbrush, which comes with its own replacement head, which would nullify the reason to purcase this product - replacement heads.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife&#x27;s electric toothbrush, as the ones in the store were too expensive. Can&#x27;t beat the price or the product.</li>
    <li> exactly what i expected. package came on time and even though it was a replacement product, it was a perfect product.</li>
    <li> I dont think I could live without my sonicare, however these refills are a little expensive. Its worth it though.</li>
    <li> It is a replacement brush head for Philips Sonicare. If you are reading this review, you must have already had a Sonicare E toothbrush. This replacement works without any problem on Sonicare Es.</li>
    <li> Yes!! I love not having to go to the store to try and find toothbrush heads for my sonic. These are on subscription, arrive every 4 months and are an automatic reminder to change to the head on my brush. Free shipping and product discount? What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> made the mistake in using generic tooth brush heads then bought the sonic. night and day never go back to the cheap generic i will always buy the sonic heads so much better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Walmart generic replacements (Equate, I think) and they are/become very loud.  These perform like the originals. .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare toothbrush for a few years and love it, but the design of this brush head isn&#x27;t the greatest.  Food particles get trapped in the brush head and actually got moldy. I since learned to take the brush head apart after each use to clean it - not very convenient. Overall I really like my Sonicare toothbrush just not the design of this brush head.</li>
    <li> Since using this product, I never wanted another toothbrush</li>
    <li> The items work very well. They are just as advertised.</li>
    <li> These are official Sonicare heads and they work as intended. My only complaint is that they are expensive but the alternative is purchasing refurbished units or the generic versions, which are absolutely worthless in my experience.  In short don&#x27;t go cheap buy the genuine replacements and buy these in the frustration free packaging.</li>
    <li> I got into the bad habit of not replacing the heat in my electric toothbrush very often due to cost.  My tooth brush was feeling like it wasn&#x27;t cleaning anymore and I really thought it was wearing out.  I for some reason decided to give a try to some new heads before I went with a replacement.  Wow was  I surprised when I found (in terms of power) that it was just like a brand new tooth brush once it had the new head on it.  Now I can easily tell how much better the new brushes work than the old ones and replace them about every 3 months.  It&#x27;s a lot more expensive than a regular toothbrush, but works very well for me.</li>
    <li> Authentic toothbrush head. Soft bristles and good quality product from Philips.</li>
    <li> It does what it is advertised to do and, after three years of daily use and twice yearly dental exams, I feel the money is well spent.</li>
    <li> I had tried cheaper &#x27;generic&#x27; brush heads from a major store chain, but they aren&#x27;t as good: noisy when vibrating and don&#x27;t clean as well (verified by 6 month dental visit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned to using actual Sonicare brushes: no noise and better clean.</li>
    <li> Amazon was the only place I could find these attachments.  I like the newly designed heads- makes it feel like I just came from the dentist each time I brush my teeth.  Price was fair given a head can last close to a year.</li>
    <li> Although I do like the sonicaire, I think the replacement brush heads are a bit pricey. For the price of replacement heads at a retailer you can by a whole new unit on the net</li>
    <li> works well. hope it holds up.cleans my teeth well. came on time.would reccommend it, tough to use regular brush after using this one.</li>
    <li> they were just as we expected, on time and quality product.  Subscribe and Save is how we remember to change things.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Brushes have a very short life and considering the high cost it is a poor value!</li>
    <li> Expensive but last a while.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does a really good job a cleaning your teeth. Frustration free packaging and subscribe and save feature make this product a winner. These brushes are way cheaper than what you pay at the local store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years. I like them. My teeth are clean. And these are good replacements. I&#x27;ve had an E Series handle for years - it doesn&#x27;t seem to wear out- and these replacements make it easy to keep it going.</li>
    <li> May be the real brush heads are better than Target&#x27;s house brand.  I&#x27;m not sure, but the vibration does feel a little more vigourous with these new brush heads.  I prefer a generic price and for many things generic is fine, sometimes better, but these may be better that generic.</li>
    <li> My dentist has commented on the improvement in my dental hygiene since I started using a Sonicare. He said that it is important to replace the heads regularly. I told him about the Amazon subscription service and he replied &amp;#34;what a great idea!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using this electronic tooth brush ever since it was announced.  Since then I have been receiving excellent reports from my dentist. I actually have two, one for the morning and another for the evening.</li>
    <li> They work as advertised and that is all you can ask of them.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> Usually these brush heads has soft bristles, but this time around it has a harder feel when brushing. Still ok though, would wait for my next subscription to see if this is a one-off or the quality has now become inconsistent.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the knock off brands of replacement heads before, and they are nothing compared to the quality of tooth care the name brand provides. There is a very noticeable difference and even though the price may be quite high, they are much better than the generic knock off.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that the bristles started falling out within a few days of use. They clean well, but having little plastic bristles end up in your mouth after each use.</li>
    <li> These replacement brushheads were easy to install on my wife&#x27;s toothbrush.  The price was comparible to any place I found in town.</li>
    <li> I was always fearful of purchasing and using a &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush but now I&#x27;m OBSESSED with it and can&#x27;t imagine using a traditional tooth brush going forward.  These replacement heads are easy and simple to install and keep me on-point with replacing the heads approximately every three months.</li>
    <li> I am using it and like it. I feel very good about it. I find the costs very high for brush replacements.</li>
    <li> The selected items were the correct match for my cordless toothbrush and the shipment was almost as fast as going out to store.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrushes ever !! We have been using SOnicare forever &amp; will continue. Our ONLY choice for our teeth. THE BEST !!</li>
    <li> These are exact replacements for my Essence brush. They come with plastic caps that cover the brush head, nice when traveling. Everything fit well, no issues and purchased cheaper than retail stores.</li>
    <li> Sonicare has been a great investment for my teeth and gums. This brush head helps you to not be harsh with your teeth. It will stop when you press too hard.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush and the easy to use replaceable heads are a breeze to change. Getting them through Amazon makes them a great value.</li>
    <li> I have been using Philips Sonicare for years.  Check ups with the dentist are a breeze, no problems. The toothbrush is a no brainer easy to use.  I would recommend this to family and friends. If they come up with something even better in the future I would love to try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare brushes for several years now and am very pleased with how clean they get my teeth. It is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> The brush on the head was too little and it didn&#x27;t have enough power.  It felt like it was made for a child.</li>
    <li> They are the actual replacement heads for the Sonicare, and the price is right and I can schedule when I want to receive them so I am never without a fresh toothbrush....</li>
    <li> Got what I paid for, in a good way. Eleven more words required huh? It was a replacement toothbrush head.</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft so they don&#x27;t hurt me teeth or gums. I have repurchased many times.</li>
    <li> I love it its a brand new plus very good quality it was same as shown in picture. Work very good.</li>
    <li> I receive these just when I need them and the price is better than buying direct from Sonicare. The auto ship feature is fantastic! One less thing to have to remember!!</li>
    <li> I like Sonicare products except that they have too many models.  It is difficult to pick the right replacement.  I had to return these for the A Series.  The product are still good quality.</li>
    <li> KEEPS YOUR TEET CLEAN BUT YOU NEED TO CHANGE THEM EVERY 6 MONTHS OR SO!</li>
    <li> Always use these.  Great!</li>
    <li> The PHILIPS SONICARE replacement brush heads are excellent! They&#x27;re a perfect fit for the original unit that was purchased over two years ago and each one lasts for several months.</li>
    <li> Not much to write when rating a tootbrush. It works, feels good and cleans my teeth. Not much more you can say. But amazon requires a minimum so there you have it.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush and have been using it for years.  The price on Amazon is competitive  and the toothbrush heads work well.  Amazon&#x27;s Frustration Free Packaging was really easy to open and the box could be recycled.</li>
    <li> I purchased some generic replacement heads a few months ago.  They both started rattling like crazy within a couple weeks of starting to use them.  The seal at the base of the brush head fell apart too.  These ones are the real deal though and have lasted much longer than the generic ones.  It&#x27;s worth spending a little more money for these ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for 20 years. My dentist always compliments me on healthy teeth and gums. I know this is from using tooth soap and my Sonicare. I wouldn&#x27;t be without them.  I also hope they continue to make this particular toothbrush head. I&#x27;m not as in love with the smaller base heads. No matter what Sonicare is the best.</li>
    <li> love them and will buy them again</li>
    <li> The price of these brushes was less than I normally have to pay for them. I&#x27;ve used these brushes for several years so the price was the real selling point for me.</li>
    <li> Stopped vibrating vigorously after 1 month, I have to screw and unscrew the attachment and adjust repeatedly until it vibrates like before, very annoying.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years.  I can&#x27;t really think of anything to say other than they work fine.</li>
    <li> I bought these E-Series Replacement Brush Heads when I ordered a new Philips Sonicare Essence HX5752/71 Power Toothbrush set.  The new toothbrush set came with brush heads so I haven&#x27;t used these yet but I know they&#x27;ll be perfect because I&#x27;ve been using the e-series heads for several years now.  I highly recommend them and I especially recommend the Philips Sonicare Essence system. Your teeth always feel like you just left the dentist.  Might I add a couple with double bathroom sinks will love the Philips Sonicare Essence HX5752/71 Power Toothbrush Twin Pack w/2 Handles, 2 Travel Caps, 2 Chargers, 2 Cases, 2 Brushheads, and 2 Brushhead Holders.</li>
    <li> These worked just fine, I liked how they send you this cheaper option that comes in the cardboard box instead of plastic.  Will be buying these again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
    <li> These replacement heads work great just like the other ones. I have subscribe and save so I receive them every couple of months. No problems with delivery or the product. And still no cavities after using these for most of my life.</li>
    <li> These are the real thing.  Purchased with Amazon Prime free shipping I received these at less cost than watching the local ads in the paper looking for a sale.  Purchasing on line was way simpler than spending hours comparing prices in the local drug and grocery stores, this is how I will order my next set of Sonic Care Brushes.  Be sure to note your Sonic Care brush model before you start shopping!  There are now several different ones out there.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised but I think it is way to expensive for the replacement brushes. The reason I have a Sonicare product is that it last longer than others seem to last. Still, the replacement brushes are to expensive.</li>
    <li> Same quality at a better price.</li>
    <li> I was glad to finally get these, as I waited 6 weeks for 2 day shipping. Don&#x27;t know what happened there. I had to finally call and then I got it fast. The brushes themselves are good, but the shape is a bit different than my original and it makes it so I splash toothpaste all over the place while brushing. I try to keep my mouth closed as much as possible but it don&#x27;t work too well. My other one did not do this. I think it is due to the tip being longer to get into the far reaches of your teeth. I don&#x27;t know why they have to mess with a good thing. it was good the way it was.</li>
    <li> Great product, but you might be able to find it cheaper at costco... but I subscribe and saveand pretty much know when a new one comes to the door it is time to change it out.</li>
    <li> Great heads! Ordered them in the brown paper box, and it kinda skeeved my wife out to receive &amp;#34;opened&amp;#34; toothbrush heads.  That&#x27;s okay though, save a few dollars, same product!</li>
    <li> Best price on the sonicare brush heads. Always feel like i just left the dentist.</li>
    <li> The real deal OEM , not a knock off. I tried the less expensive white box replacements, they are terrible.. these are the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Not the best price, but very fair, and with the scheduled delivery, no worries.</li>
    <li> Just what you&#x27;d expect (or hope to have shipped).</li>
    <li> Much less expensive that CostCo; does the same thing. No problems.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet.  Arrived on time and so far I am happy.  I hope this replacement works out.</li>
    <li> The original brush lasted me for 5 years. I ordered this in December 2014 and now two months later, two groups of brushes have fallen out. I am very disappointed in the quality of this replacement product. I thought I would be safer buying from the original company but they must have had a bad batch. I guess I&#x27;ll use it now for a jewelry or shoe brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried substituting other brands such as Walmart and thought I was doing just fine and saving money, till I read how the two differ.  At once I realized the difference in the results.  Buy Phillips - it matters.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been getting them for a while. It saves you a lot of effort while cleans well. Will continue using.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had to replace with the new heads. The bristles are extremely hard and irritate my gums. I have to put the head under scalding water to soften it up. I&#x27;ve tried to contact Phillips to complain about the change, but have been unsuccessful so far.</li>
    <li> These are great! Definitely recommend replacing your brush heads every 3 months for the best results. They keep my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads worked fine.  Came exactly on time and I went with hassle free packaging, which I had never done before and I don&#x27;t regret it.  Really easy to get out and the packaging was all recyclable, so worth it for me.  Definitely will repurchase when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I have used the Philips Sonicare for a few years now and have been having much easier cleanings when I visit the dentist.  Since I had worn out the original brush heads, I was happy to see replacements at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works great, but doesn&#x27;t last. Almost as if they&#x27;re engineered to wear out early to make the customer purchase them more often. Grossly overpriced as well.</li>
    <li> I like the price and the product. I wonder sometimes if the brushes are the same as in the other packages.</li>
    <li> Quality and fit are perfect, just as expected. These come from the manufacturer and meet or exceed the original equipment provided. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product via &amp;#34;suscribe and save&amp;#34; for probably 4 years. I&#x27;ve had my sonicare toothbrush for 5 years.  It&#x27;s amazingly convenient to automatically have this delivered. I always have some on hand to replace my toothbrush head when I notice it&#x27;s worn down. These toothbrush heads fit perfectly. They come in very convenient, easy open packaging.  They are exactly what I need every time.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brush, These have been working superbly for me for years.&lt;br /&gt;Gums stay healthy and strong. It is important to replace them periodically as you will&lt;br /&gt;not benefit from the brush heads if they are not durable,I replace mine every 90 days</li>
    <li> Arrived super quickly--within one or two days. The packing makes it really easy. I have had the toothbrush for almost 8 years, and it still works great, especially with these easy-to-access replacement heads.</li>
    <li> The replacement brush heads arrived promptly and work with my electric toothbrush model as stated on the product page.  I will likely purchase them again when I need more replacements.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, they&#x27;re toothbrush heads and they work.</li>
    <li> Instantly noticed how much quieter the OEM brush heads vs brushing with generic ones I purchased previously.  Well worth spending a couple of dollars extra.  Feels like they do a better job as well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the same as the Phillips brushes in the store, but at a much better price.  I love how they make my teeth feel!  Well worth the money.  I use subscribe and save and they always show up just in time.</li>
    <li> I recommend the Philips Sonicare system for daily dental hygine. Heads are easily to replace and last 3-6 months depending on how much daily usage.</li>
    <li> Fits perfect, and works great,  Delivered fast and and best of all a great price.  Easy open package was just that, easy to open,</li>
    <li> Your website has the best prices fro replacement heads. Local stores a just too expensive for my pocket. Thanks for making them available,</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare!  It&#x27;s so convenient to find a great price on Amazon for the replacement heads!</li>
    <li> rarely these days is something actually reeived as it was advertised, this is one of those products that fit right</li>
    <li> These are good value and oem brushes.  Found better price at Sam&#x27;s now that amazon has a distribution center in Florida and has to charge sales tx</li>
    <li> My only problem is with the price.  What an incredible feeling of clean!</li>
    <li> I have already reviewed this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already reviewed this item.  I don&#x27;t plan to change my expressed views.</li>
    <li> Nothing turns a Sonciare into a paperweight like a $40 replacement head.  Amazon is the best place to get replacement heads.  The heads are genuine Sonicare, work with no problem and the no fuss packaging is a nice feature.  Can&#x27;t think of a single &amp;#34;con&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware: Order this WAY before you actually need it. Yes, it says Prime, but that&#x27;s only once it ships. I ordered this December 12, and as of the 21st it still hasn&#x27;t shipped. SERIOUSLY!? The estimated arrival is the 27th, which is ridiculous for a Prime item that was ordered on the 12th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT SAID. Great toothbrush, yes the heads are expensive to replace but by doing a better job they reduce the risk for cavities and $10/head is a whole lot cheaper than a filling! Seriously after I got used to brushing with this, the few times I&#x27;ve had to use a manual toothbrush (traveled and didn&#x27;t bring the sonicare) it felt like I was brushing with a piece of paper towel over my finger. Hated it! I&#x27;m sold for life on Sonicare, now I just know to order the replacement heads a month before I need them. *rolls eyes*</li>
    <li> I was a t first reluctant to order this product but it featured a &amp;#34;guaranteed&amp;#34; easy to open box and a universal fit for Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;E Series Products. I was delighted to find the box easy to open, the fit was perfect on my Sonicare and the results better than&lt;br /&gt;the original brush heads. I can recommend this product without hesitation. It is economical, covenient and works!</li>
    <li> To expensive and way to hard bristle</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are excellent.  They are somewhat pricey, but last longer than the three month replacement suggestion.  I change mine every 4- 5 months.  I also buy them at CVS  on sale with a  $5.00 manufactures coupon, which makes them $19.00 for a 2-pack.  Good price!</li>
    <li> I use my toothbrush every day so what can I say about the replacement brushes???  They are fine - ???</li>
    <li> These are a great price. arrived early.  love these tooth brushes.  our whole family uses and loves these tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush, I have been using it for years. It would be great if the replacement heads weren&#x27;t quite so expensive but oh well they make my teeth feel clean. The only down side is how nasty it gets between the base and the head but I found some great protectors here on Amazon that keep all the water out so mold doesn&#x27;t grow, it would be nice if Sonicare offered these for free to people that drop all the money on their product tho!</li>
    <li> These replacement heads work great as the original ones but they are HUGE waste of plastic. I got this toothbrush as a present so i wanted to get some use out if it. I will eventually switch to Braun to save on the plastic this wastes.</li>
    <li> This is the OEM replacement product not a Chinese knock-off. Price is approximately 30% less than at any other place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare toothbrush for many years, and while I know that the company has come up with better designs since then, the E-series does the job.  I also have the Oral-B electric toothbrush, which spins.  These Sonicare brush heads don&#x27;t spin, so to get a thorough clean you must make circular motions with the brush as you move from one section of your mouth to the next.  If you&#x27;re a diligent brusher, then these brush heads will do you just fine.  My dental hygienist approves at my checkups!</li>
    <li> Pros: relatively cheaper, easy to open, good protective package, recyclable package&lt;br /&gt;Cons: nothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare electric tooth brush is really powerful and it needs replace brush.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Work fine, should last me or a year or so.  Cheaper than Walmart or other places.</li>
    <li> I recieved a free sonicare toothbrush from my dentist. Then I had to replace the heads. My drug store was asking close to $30.00 for replacements. No thanks. Found them here for $8.00 less. Plus if you replace them every six months you can get discount.</li>
    <li> I like the reduced no frustration packaging a lot.  The brush head&#x27;s bristles didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as others I&#x27;ve used though. It also seemed noisier than previously used ones.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain. Wish I could find a softer brush, but these work very well.  My &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; is many years old now, and these brushes keep me from having to buy a new one!!</li>
    <li> These heads are obviously not of SONICARE quality. \\&quot;Drool\\&quot; runs down the shaft past a floppy loose seal, through the vibrating mechanism and battery, and out to the charger base. The entire device must be cleaned VERY frequently to even partially remove the unsanitary/unsightly mess. A disgusting rip-off. The only good thing is that the box is easier to open than the customary blister pac.</li>
    <li> worked fine and the price was reasonable. They worked fine, fine fine fine fine fine fine - geez - do not like minimum words on reviews.</li>
    <li> I tried to by knock-offs to save a few bucks, but they were twice as loud when vibrating than the Phillps brand.  These are direct replacement for my Sonicare, and are made by Phillips and for 2/3 the price than the big box store.</li>
    <li> Generic brands I bought at the store rattled a lot so I use this product only. Exactly what came with the original electric brush so no surprises here.</li>
    <li> When i ordered the tooth brush itself it came with the e series brush head but i didn,t see it among choiceto order so i ordered these. hopefully they will be as good as the e series.</li>
    <li> Sonicare quality that you expect. The best toothbrush around and these work great. Set to automatic delivery and I no longer need to worry about buying toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> The basic product design leaves something to be desired however, as it collects liquid and gunk inside which must be disassembled and cleaned frequently</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used sonicare for years.  This was a great way to get brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The simple packaging makes sense to me.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! Fit an older handle that I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would. Didn&#x27;t want to have to get a whole new handle also. Arrived quickly, nice packaging.</li>
    <li> My dentist and hygienist always complements me on &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t floss very often.  This toothbrush does it for me!!</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare E series Standard Replacement Brush Heads 2 pack is an excellent value and a great product, the subscription purchases are the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent transaction.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to purchase the original brush heads!</li>
    <li> Toothbrush heads fit my tootbrush.  Make sure you order the right head for your brush.  Great price.  Its a toothbrush head, what can I say.  I have clean teeth.</li>
    <li> They work, no issues price is still way to high but then it cleans teeth  well so I have to look at as an investment.</li>
    <li> I get these every 6 months.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Standard E series toothbrush heads.  No problem connecting to my Sonicare; just like the ones I buy in bulk at Costco.  The packaging was easier to open than the standard packaging that comes with the toothbrush heads I normally buy.</li>
    <li> Perfect just as described</li>
    <li> great heads! a bit cheaper from amazon than from cvs/local stores.</li>
    <li> it is always good to have the right tool close to you.This brushes are The best.keep you away from the doctor.</li>
    <li> One time I made the mistake of buying a replacement head at box store.  The price was great but product didn&#x27;t work.  It was not a Philips.  It was cheaper than the ones purchased through Amazon, but no matter how cheap an item is, it is overpriced if it does not work.  I have not had this problem when ordering through Amazon.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Sonicare toothbrush is considerably more effective than a manual brush or a battery powered spin brush (like Crest or Colgate).  I have used mine for several years and trips to the dentist are much more pleasant than they used to be.  It takea a little getting used to but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Customer service at Phillips is also very good.  On a trip to Europe I blew up my charging base and when I called Customer Service and explained my situation they sent me a new one for free.  There is also a battery version of the Sonicare (which I also own) but I would recommend the rechargeable one...it seems to be more effective.</li>
    <li> It fits the existing brush base I had perfectly.  I really liked the small packaging it came in.  Also, it is much quieter when brushing than the heads that my brush originally came with!</li>
    <li> When you can&#x27;t touch or feel the item you&#x27;re looking for, you have to depend on the picture and description and cross your fingers.  In this case, it was exactly what I wanted!  And they were shipped so quickly!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I got them to have on hand for the future when my other one needs replacing. I really like this tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I have a clean teeth b/c of these. I wish they would last a bit longer and didn&#x27;t always break but all in all they work well.</li>
    <li> I would buy these brush heads again.............I would like to see more color choices but it would be a bit more interesting</li>
    <li> These replacement brush heads fit the toothbrush great!  Not hard to replace at all.  Easy to use.  Just like the original.</li>
    <li> my fiance loves the sonicare toothbrush, he uses it and comes out of the bathroom with a huge smile, totally loves it</li>
    <li> My teeth are happy and also is my pocketbook.  This was a great price for these two brushes and they work with my unit just fine.</li>
    <li> A good portion of my shopping at amazon is done to save money.  These replacement heads are a great example of an identical product that is nearly 1/3 of the cost in the big box store.  Save your money for something else, these will work just fine to clean your teeth yo.</li>
    <li> these sonicare heads fit just as described and the packaging is fine by me.  these serve their purpose just like any other sonicare head.</li>
    <li> just as expected- you could have got four heads in that box though... SO much less expensive than the drugstore!</li>
    <li> W A R N I N G&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A piece inside the unit broke after a few weeks of use.  It started to rattle and didn&#x27;t vibrate like it should have. The good news is that Amazon.com is awesome and will refund you the money, even if it&#x27;s past the grace period in which they allow a typical refund. So if yours breaks, contact an awesome Amazon rep (I used the chat feature) and they will take care of you.</li>
    <li> Product made to the specifications of the originals and work very well. I had purchased some cheaper ones claiming to be a good replacement and was very disappointed in the excessive noise they made in my brush head. This is a quality product for a very fair price.</li>
    <li> I like that I get these shipped every six months so I don&#x27;t have to remember when to change the heads.  I just change them when the new ones arrive.&lt;br /&gt;Just visited the dentist yesterday for a cleaning and she told me to &amp;#34;keep doing what you are doing.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These are great replacements at a really good price.  They are the cheapest that I have seen and they work perfectly.  If you use the sonicare system I recommend these replacement heads.</li>
    <li> this is the only product so far that I have on the automatic reorder. I get them new ever six months and that reminds me to change them so &amp;#34;we&amp;#34; get the full benefit of our Sonic Toothbrush</li>
    <li> Only toothbrush we have used for over 12 years. My dental cleanings are mainly just inspections, no plaque or stains. We get replacement heads delivered with subscribe and save, great price and delivered to the door.</li>
    <li> The heads on your electric toothbrush should be changed out every 6 months. So having replacement heads is important. Shop around for a good price since the range is amazing. These brushes are firm, but smaller than a manual toothbrush head. Takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Phillips Soniacare toothbruch replacements from Amazon because they are great brushes and last for around 3 months and they are great. I love them and would reccomend to anyone.</li>
    <li> For those who really don&#x27;t believe that there is a difference between this and other electronic toothbrushes.  I have used multiple other types of electronic toothbrushes.  Mainly because I was cheap and didn&#x27;t want to throw in the money.  Just like most other things, I was wrong.  There is a decisive difference in this and other toothbrushes.  My dentist agreed when I went in for my last check up and I feel a difference every morning after use.  Just spend the money!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping &amp; they fit perfectly</li>
    <li> The maker and my de moist recommend changing brush heads several times a year. This was a money saver versus other places to buy.</li>
    <li> I get an A+ check up every time at the dentist and I haven&#x27;t had any gum problems. With a regular toothbrush, I &amp;#34;overbrushed&amp;#34; and was scrubbing away my gums. Sonicare is THE BEST.</li>
    <li> If you have a Sonic toothbrush, these are a good price, if you don&#x27;t have a Sonic you should, it is worth every penny</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a deal...this seems to be the best priced combo pack I have been able to find in any store.</li>
    <li> Great,BUY more save more.</li>
    <li> My dental hygnist always comments on how good my teeth look.She says they are very easy to clean. She always wants me as a client because I make her work easy.</li>
    <li> Works great. Just like the Sonicare &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; series, but much less cost!</li>
    <li> These were no good.  All three vibrated off the base while I was brushing.  Could not return because of date purchased.  Purchased same refills at Kroger and they are fine.</li>
    <li> I think these replacement heads are a great buy for the money, and I decided to buy these rather than the generic kind which was not much cheaper than the Philips heads, in order to make sure that they fit correctly. They are just like the original heads that came with my toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> The packaging may not be attractive, but the product is good as gold. I would keep buying them, this was the 3rd time I have and they are excellent!</li>
    <li> i really do love the packaging - I don&#x27;t have to get heavy equipment to release the product from it package!!  and the product is performing as expected.</li>
    <li> These can&#x27;t be actual Sonicare Brand.  I bought this last year and have dealt with vibration issues where you can almost hear the brush vibrating from outside the house.  This never gave a tight fit.  It seemed like these were some cheap knockoff.  We just bought some real ones from the store and have not had any problems with those at all.  These ones we had to throw away within a month.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare makes my teeth feel very clean. The packaging on this particular product is very easy to open. No cutting plastic packaging anymore!</li>
    <li> Seem to be the real deal and not a knock off. Great quality. Didn&#x27;t know how badly I needed a replacement until I got the new one and could feel how much better it worked to clean my teeth. Not to mention the hygiene part. Normal toothbrushes should be changed very often, sonicare is no different.</li>
    <li> I have had a Philips Sonicare tooth brush for many years.  I have loved it and it does a great jobs at cleaning my teeth.  (my dential hygenist says so!).  These replacement heads are cheaper buying on Amazon than at the drug store.  So you let a bargain and clean teeth.</li>
    <li> The  only reason this does not get 5 stars is that there is a failure to get a deal onlinle. from the store prices (which are expensive anyway) I guess you have to pay through the nose for the best.</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicare Products for years and couldn&#x27;t find these replacement heads at a good price except the big warehouse stores.  However these are offered as a Subscribe and Save item on Amazon which makes these available at a very attractive price.</li>
    <li> They fit my Soniccare Quad perfectly.</li>
    <li> WORKS JUST AS GOOD AS THE ONES FROM WAL-MART,BUT FOR LESS MONEY.FITS PERFECTLY TO MY ATACHMENT. ALSO LIKED THE PACKAGING(EASY TO OPEN).</li>
    <li> We love this toothbrush</li>
    <li> Compatible with E-Series. I have purchased several time and will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> Sonicare toothbrushes keep my teeth so clean that I&#x27;m out of the dental hygienist&#x27;s chair in 10 minutes. I&#x27;ve been using them for 20 years and they keep getting better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brush heads for years with no problems. They attach securely to the brush handle, and function perfectly. The included plastic caps keep water and other materials from splashing onto the bristles. I usually go a few months before replacing them, and even then the bristles are in pretty good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these to a friend.</li>
    <li> I got them and I love them.  They work better than the older heads which had a larger brush area but didn&#x27;t clean as good at these new ones do.  Thanks for getting them to me so fast.  Jim</li>
    <li> For some reason, these replacement heads don&#x27;t seem to perform as well as the prior ones. Don&#x27;t understand why that would be or maybe I&#x27;m losing my mind.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price would do business again</li>
    <li> Just as I ordered  Fits my toothbrush</li>
    <li> Great. Built in timer. On time.</li>
    <li> I returned these as they were the wrong brushes for my Sonicare and ordered the correct model.</li>
    <li> After use of this product, my teeth appear to be the same oatmeal color as before. But my breath is less repellent to my girlfriend. Honestly, why are you reading these reviews? You know what you&#x27;re buying. Just price compare.</li>
    <li> I love the Philips Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is great, just wish it replacement brushes were not so expensive.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t changed your brush heads in a while, do it. You&#x27;ll be able to feel the difference and it&#x27;ll seem like a brand new toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Have ordered these for years. Love our Sonicare toothbrushes. Sure wished they were not so expensive. We do get good results when we go to the dentist tho.</li>
    <li> Found out I can buy these a lot cheaper in Costco.  Like everything in Costco I have to buy more at one time but I plan to hang onto my teeth for a while so I know Ill use all the Costco brush heads eventually</li>
    <li> Recommend this product to those with the old version of Sonicare.  Tough to find these replacement heads in store, so this was a perfect way to purchase.</li>
    <li> I order these brush heads because they give me the results I want and need. I had my regular checkup and cleaning yesterday and got rave reviews from my dental provider. My teeth love the cleanings when there is very little plaque to be removed. I&#x27;ll continue using this product in the future. I follow the recommendation to replace the brush head every 3 months and get great results. When a product works as great as this one, it sells itself as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the Philips Sonicare to me years ago.  Since then I have gone through quite a number of brush heads and two complete Sonicare units.  I found the easiest way...and the most reasonable way...to buy Sonicare brush heads is through Amazon.  If you don&#x27;t have a Sonicare brush, I recommend you buy one from Amazon, and if you do have a brush, get the heads from Amazon, too.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is the best way to maintain good hygiene. That&#x27;s all the words I have so this is to meet the 20 character minimum.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase. The brush material and color seems different from the brush that came with the original Sonicare tooth brush. Hopefully it will hold up but seems good for now. At this point I would purchase again. Price was great.</li>
    <li> I think Sonicare&#x27;s brush head quality is slipping. They used to last a year. Now I find myself needing to replace the heads in under 6 months. If I had a good alternative, I would buy it.</li>
    <li> great replacement brushes</li>
    <li> I have purchased \\&quot;Frustration Free\\&quot; packaged heads and they do NOT last, period. Both the cardboard boxed ones and heads in sealed plastic bags soften to a useless state within a dozen brushes. They look real, fit correctly, has correct printing but you can tell something is not right as soon as you put the brush on your teeth the very first time. Arrgggh. I rather deal with rigid plastic clamshell packaging knowing I&#x27;m getting the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; not some cheap-o imo reject made in who&#x27;s knows what basement.</li>
    <li> good price and fast service what else could you ask for</li>
    <li> Filled the bill as replacement brush heads and the packaging was easy to open!  Purchased these online as I forgot to pick them up.  Price was right too.</li>
    <li> This it the best and easiest way to clean my teeth even my dentist noticied the difference. Would recommend to someone else.</li>
    <li> Good replacement heads.  Worked with no issues.  Good price, and very good quality.  I would recommend this to anyone needing new heads for their SoniCare.</li>
    <li> We get these every few months to replace the heads on our electric toothbrush and we wouldn&#x27;t go with any other brand.  They are very durable and they get the job done perfectly every time.</li>
    <li> It is what is says it is. Simply packaged (none of that obnoxious hard plastic molded stuff). They are original units designed for the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> It shipped fast enough and the product itself is good. I just wish these replaceable heads were cheaper. I mean for something that should be replaced every few months it adds up and gets expensive. On the other hand it&#x27;s a good product and gets my teeth feeling so clean. It might be worth the expense.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for the a number of people.  The value was better than I have found in the stores.  They fit the Essence model we all use.</li>
    <li> I love the product and the subscription program.  I receive the heads every three months on the dot at a great price.</li>
    <li> The heads are always good to have on hand so I can switch out after so many month. Like them</li>
    <li> Good quality and service.</li>
    <li> Works with the older E-series Philips Sonicare toothbrushes.  The older toothbrush head are larger and screw on, unlike the newer snap one kind.  The older toothbrushes are very had to keep clean.  There is a well in the center of the handle that tend to accumulate &#x27;stuff&#x27; (old toothpaste, ect.).</li>
    <li> These were not the original style of brushes that came with my brush years ago.  Since Phillips bought the brand it has gone down hill.  It is still the best, but not as good as the original Sonicare was.  I have to brush longer to get as good a checkup at the dentist.  The improvements in the brushing head are to cut cost not improve the operation.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare Elite for many years, and I am very satisfied with the brushes and the frustration free packaging. Some pros and cons to note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;* The brushes are very effective at removing plaque when used as indicated, more so than just a regular brush, and they tend to be long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;* DO buy the Phillips branded brushes. I have purchased other brushes that fit the handle, only to have the bristles wear out too fast or the magnets in the brush shake loose.&lt;br /&gt;* Old brush heads are great for cleaning small items like jewelry and tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;* These brush heads are prone to mold and mildew if not taken care of properly. Prop the heads upright to drain water. An occasional squirt of Tilex or X-14 will help keep the brush base clean.&lt;br /&gt;* The handle recharge base is also prone to get dirty easily and should be cleaned with soap occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;* Off-brand brushes tend to fall apart easily from the vibration and use. Even with cleaning and proper care, I have had brush magnets fall off, mildew inside the handle, the base and brush completely separate, among other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;* The brushes are effective and tend to be long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;* DO buy the Phillips branded brushes.&lt;br /&gt;* These brush heads are prone to mold and mildew if not taken care of properly.</li>
    <li> These work great, but I think buying them at Costco is a better deal.  I will probably check Costco first next time.</li>
    <li> This is original equipment, works great just like the original that came with the brush when you opened the box.</li>
    <li> This system of tooth and mouth care is the very best that I have experience and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> toothbrushes.  expensive but i like them.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these brush heads.  They arrived quickly and fit my old school Soniccare toothbrush handle perfectly.  I will be ordering these again in a year when they heads need replacing again.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads if anything are better than the originals. They are well worth it! Got them quickly and they&#x27;re awesome.</li>
    <li> this is the best investment so far ever did. It cleans the heck out of the teeth. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Yes, they did fit my unit as replacement.  They are definitely over-priced since Phillips say they should be replaced every couple months of use.  Disappointed that there are not choice of bristle stiffness with just the one offered.  Don&#x27;t know why they have to be so costly.  The two of us run through these heads fast and really over-use them because of the cost.</li>
    <li> Love them makes your teeth feel like as close too getting them clean by the dentist office as you can get.</li>
    <li> Product arrived within a few days in perfect condition. As advertised, the packaging was easy to open. The bristles were a different color from store bought replacement heads, but didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference in use. I would buy again, as it saves the trouble&#x27; of hunting them down in a store.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve bought these several times.  They are brand name quality for good price.</li>
    <li> Great to get rid of the plastic packaging. Reliable rechargeable toothbrush. Only difficulty is what do I do with the old heads?</li>
    <li> If you love your toothbrush, these are the only replacement heads I would buy!</li>
    <li> It´s a very good product, i recommended to everyone here in my country, everyone in my home have one of these</li>
    <li> I purchased my first Sonicare Toothbrush in 1996.  It was advertised on the radio each afternoon when I was leaving work by none other than PAUL HARVEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dental technician clearly noticed the differencne the next time I had my teeth cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlene Harris</li>
