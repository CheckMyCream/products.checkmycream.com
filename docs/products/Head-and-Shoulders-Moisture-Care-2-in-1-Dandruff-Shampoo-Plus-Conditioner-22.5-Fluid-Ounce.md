<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the softness of my hair lately! Smells great feels great!! Ill buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Just got my full sized head &amp; shoulders. It&#x27;s great on my hair! First I used the 2in1 then I used the cowash. Last was the scalf soother and I&#x27;m really happy with the results!!</li>
    <li> Please note the opinions and views in this review are solely my own, I was given the product for free courtesy of Head &amp; Shoulders. I have a history of dandruff it seems to run in my family. I hate the word dandruff sounds icky so in other terms happy flakes! lol. I loved the scent right away. I noticed that the flakes in my hair were gone and I wasn’t as itchy as usual. A couple days ago, my hair stylist was combing through my hair and she commented on the fact that an area in the back that is flake prone looked a lot better. My hair is much cleaner looking without all the flakes.</li>
    <li> Makes hair feel very soft and easy to brush through and cant forget smelling good! I would recommend this product to others. Hair doesn&#x27;t feel as dry anymore which I love. I received the product free from Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
    <li> I received this produdct free from bzzagent to try out and give my opinion.  My experience with outher dandruff shampoos on my relaxed hair is it stripped my hair of any moisture.  I tried this product thinking the same thing but I was wrong.  I liked the light coconut fragrance. It was not over powering.  The product cleaned my hair good and rinsed out well.  I felt it had enough conditioner as I was able to come through my hair after washing and towel drying.  I followed up with blow dry and flat iron.  The next day my hair was bouncy and my scalp was not irritated or itchy at all.</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing but that is the best attribute to this 2 n 1 moisturizing wash.&lt;br /&gt;However my scalp felt  Refreshed after I used this product. My hair on the other hand was so dry. This product Does not have any where near enough moisturizer in it. I was able to try this product free thanks to being a bzzagent in return of my honest opinion on this product.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair dry and unmanageable.</li>
    <li> I received this new product Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection courtesy of my friendly neighborhood BzzAgent!  I was originally leery about signing up for this product because H&amp;S was always a dandruff problem, which I don&#x27;t have.  But occasionally during the colder months I will have a drier scalp.  But then my son started having dry skin issues so I decided to have a go with it.  First off, when I received the box I was blown over by just how heavy it was.  These containers are huge - what&#x27;s more? a little goes a LONG way.  The directions suggest a twice a week usage and for him that&#x27;s pretty much on par.  The fragrance was very pleasant - not medicated at all.  It came with a 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner, a co-wash and a spray bottle of scalp soother.  The directions don&#x27;t explain very well which should be used when but I went in that order.  All are listed as being for &amp;#34;textured hair&amp;#34; - sounds good so far, can&#x27;t get much more textured than our hair.  They contain almond oil and coconut.  What I like the most is the moisture care Scalp Soother.  I use that on him in between shampoos and it&#x27;s like a whole new head.  It&#x27;s softer, shinier, and no longer as dry when I brush it.&lt;br /&gt;#gotitfree #moisturecare</li>
    <li> I got this for free from Head &amp; Shoulders.  I must say I would have never tried it if I didn&#x27;t get a sample, which is a shame and I would have definity would have been missing out! As a woman with 3 daughters who all have hair like me - thick curly and long- we are going though a ton of shampoo!  I would recommend this 100000% I am going to go to purchase this here AS SOON as I run out.  The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the smell.  But you will get over that once you see how it makes your hair feel and look.</li>
    <li> Husband new favorite shampoo. He usually uses medicated shampoos, it&#x27;s great to finally try something that leaves his scalp feeling clean, doesn&#x27;t dry it out more, all well smelling great! Happy to have been able to try this for free prior to having to make the purchase decision, Thanks bzzagent!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free courtesy of Head and Shoulders and BzzAgent. I was really skeptical about this product because Head and Shoulders has never been ethnic or natural hair friendly but I decided to give them a try. I&#x27;ve been natural for about 3 years and I always wear my hair straightened. When I tried the 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner and I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all. I didn&#x27;t see a big difference in the product and the other 2 in 1 products I&#x27;ve used in the past so I wasn&#x27;t really sure where the &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; hair aspect comes in at. This product left my hair feeling dry even before my hair was completely dry. I haven&#x27;t flat ironed my hair to see how it actually will turn out but I&#x27;m a little scared. Hopefully once I flat iron my hair I won&#x27;t regret using this in my hair and have to re-wash it. I most than likely won&#x27;t be using the other products in the line that I received for free. I gave this product 2 stars because I love the smell and the consistency of this product is really thick and creamy.</li>
    <li> I received this 2-in-1 Shampoo through bzzagent to review. I haven&#x27;t used head &amp; shoulders products since I was a little girl, but was excited to use this! This 2-in-1 moisture care smells AMAZING and really cleans the scalp. My problem with this is it severely dries out the hair. The scalp is very moisturized and hydrated and feels fresh, but my hair felt dry and a bit brittle. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again because it really dried out my hair, but would recommend if people have super oily hair, because this will take away all the oils.</li>
    <li> Wow let me started  by saying I love it! It smell great nice package  look and got my flakes out the first use so i was sold I recommend  this product  because  it works what can I say but that I think everyone  should try to see how it works for them but for me it&#x27;s a winner I always use head and shoulder  product  but i like this one  just far better.and yes I got my for free for being a #BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I received Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 as a promotion from BzzAgent to use and review. Prior to using this product, I had limited use with Head &amp; Shoulders and had not used any of their products in years. My hair type is dry from years of processing with relaxers. It&#x27;s current state is natural. Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 revitalized my hair and gave it much needed moisture from the combination delivery of almond oil and coconut. I felt like I was enjoying a spa experience as I washed my hair because the shampoo and conditioner is silky and smells amazing. My hair felt soft and was easier to comb after washing. I highly recommend and will continue to use in combination with the other products in the line including the Head &amp; Shoulders Co-Wash and Head &amp; Shoulders Scalp Soother.</li>
    <li> I have a dry scalp and I must say this product is a godsend. I love this product alot! I received it for free from Head and Shoulders, I just love the way it makes my curls bounce and feel very moisturized. It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of the necessary oil it needs which tends to leave it dry but it does just enough so that my hair is clean and not oily. I used this along with the co-wash and they both leave my hair very soft, clean and smelling sooooo good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a while and noticed less to no flakes. It has a nice righ lather and the smell is ok. It doesn&#x27;t have that medicine anti-dandruff aroma that are in the typical dandruff shampoos. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> The Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 is an okay product. It keeps hair flake free hands down. However, it needs to be combined with another conditioner in order to keep my natural AA hair from being dry. Mind you, I would happily take this over a regular shampoo, but for a 2-in-1 product my expectation is that I will not have to use an additional conditioner to maintain softness and manageability. I tried this product free through BzzAgent and am glad for the opportunity. The co-wash is a much better option.</li>
    <li> This is great on my hair, it leaves it with a soft coconut scent and l really like the consistency. It is nice and thick and I like that cause it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to lather up. I received this free from BzzAgent #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I am a member of BzzAgent and I received the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner free to try from Head &amp; Shoulders. I suffer from dandruff and have been looking for a shampoo that would work for my natural hair. This product works very well. It does the job without drying my hair out which is a plus because I don&#x27;t have to add extra product to my hair. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Aside from the wonderful fragrance that comes with this 2-in-1 shampoo/conditoner duo, I did not care for it much at all. I cannot seem to figure out where the &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; part comes into play. This stuff seriously left my hair so dry &amp; lifeless. It felt like straw during washing,  as well as afterwards. I had higher hopes for this product, but it is not my cup of tea.  It just may be a hair-type thing, so you may love it &amp; it may do wonders for you. But I will have to pass on this product. I gave the rest of it to my husband &amp; he gave it to his co-worker.</li>
    <li> I received this wonderful product from a great company Bzzagent. I was curious to see how well this product stands with my other hair care products. My hair is sometimes dry after I wash because some of the hair cares products especially around the winter times. When I tried this I realize that my hair wasn’t dry anymore it made my hair shiny and smooth and very moisturize. Because it is made with coconut I knew it would make my hair smell amazing.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Made my hair super soft but also paying close attention to dandruff.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on my husband, he has dry flaky hair and this worked great.  His hair does go back dry about 2 days later but that&#x27;s better than daily.  He at least gets a break from the flaking for a day or two.  Glad I was about to get this product free to try from Head and Shoulders.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try a full size bottle of the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 through BzzAgent, and I must admit that was rather disappointed with this one. Although a little goes a long way, it just left me hair feeling dry and certainly not moisturized. I am bi-racial and have thick, curly, shoulder length hair. Moisture is extremely important with naturally curly hair. I have tried hundreds of products over the years and was really hoping that this would be a winner. The scent is amazing, because I LOVE anything that smells like coconut. It&#x27;s truly a preference of mine, and I&#x27;m actually known for smelling like coconuts/tropical scents at work! Again, I am grateful to have tried this product, but it just didn&#x27;t deliver the moisture as promised. Kudos to Head &amp; Shoulders for finally coming out with a line that addresses textured hair, but I think more work needs to be done in order to ensure moisture and conditioning for us curly girls!</li>
    <li> Do you have a dry scalp? If so this is the product for you. I used the 2 in 1 care as a part of the moisture care collection and I was very pleased. I have a dry scalp and the entire collection is helping me get rid of flakes. For that I am truly grateful. Would defiantly recommend. Received for free from bzzzagent but did not get an incentive for a better review.</li>
    <li> The 2-1 shampoo and conditioner did a good job in washing away all of the dirt and grime and left my hair smelling fresh and clean. I liked the lather that I got from this as a little goes a long way. I also liked the ingredients like vitamin E, almond oil, and coconut abstract. The one concern for me about this product is that although it did do a good job of getting my hair and scalp clean I did notice that for me it did not do a good job in providing as much moisture back into my hair than I was expecting. I have very dry hair to begin with and I am looking for products that will not dry it out even more. I noticed after using the 2-1 that my hair was very dry and  hard to de-tangle. For the past few months I have been using products that have all natural ingredients like Shea butter and argon oil. The current shampoo that I use is paraben and sulfate free and it has really made a huge difference in my hair. I don&#x27;t have any de-tangling issues and my hair feels very moisturized, hydrated, refresh, and soft with my other hair care system. I also try to stay away from hair products that include Sulfate as this 2-1 does contain. Sulfates are very strong cleansers that can dissolve the oils on your skin, and  can cause your hair and scalp to be dry and can cause or worsen eczema, dandruff, and other conditions. I have African American hair which is more inherent to being drier and brittle compared to other nationalities which is why I try to stay away from products that carry harsh ingredients. The 2-1 system did do a good job in cleaning my hair but I just wish that my hair felt softer and had a little more moisture after using this product.  I received this product courtesy of BzzAgent in exchange for honest review.</li>
    <li> Yes my title said awesome. For you to understand why I say that I need to tell you about my hair and scalp. I have an extremely dry scalp. My hair is short, natural, course, and textured. I suffer from visibly horrible dandruff that no amount of shampooing could get rid of I would always have some flakes, sometimes a lot. Other shampoos seemed like they only moved the flakes around and on top of that left my hair rough and feeling stripped. So when I tried the head and shoulders 2 in 1 moisture care I didn&#x27;t hold much hope. Man was I wrong.  Head and shoulders claim 7 benefits: 1. Removes flakes- yes it did. I noticed maybe one or two flakes after my first wash which is unheard of for my hair. 2. Calms itching- yes it did. My scalps usually itches so bad and I have scratched until it bleed before. But my itching has reduced by at least 95% 3. Relieves irritation- yes. With less itching my scalp is not as irritated. 4. Reduces redness- this I don&#x27;t know for sure but I assume it does snice the irritation is reduced. 5. Great scent- the scent is good for a dandruff shampoo. Most of them smell medicated but not this one. 6. Fights dryness- yes it does. My hair is not left feeling dry afterwards. It feels moisturized and manageble for a couple of days, which is also unheard of 7. Leaves hair beautiful- yes it does. With the irritation gone and hair feeling more moisturized and manageble it can&#x27;t help but be beautiful.  All in all I would highly recommend this product. I will be purchasing more. Even though I&#x27;m not finished with my bottle have have been checking different stores to see if they are there and to price them. I&#x27;m a happy camper. BTW I received this product from bzzagent.com and head and shoulders and this is my honest review. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> love this stuff my sister in law has really bad dandruff and she been using it for a week and her flakes are gone will keep buying this stuff</li>
    <li> I received the 2 in 1 from bzzagent to try. I didnt like it. As a cosmetologist, i know shampoo opens hair cuticles and conditioner closes them. I dont know how you can do both at the same time. I have straight long hair and had such a difficult time running a brush through my hair sfter my shower, It was a rats nest!</li>
    <li> i received this product for free from bzzagent. in return i have to share my honest opnion about this product. i absolutely love it. it has made my hair oh so soft!  and lovely i would def. buy this!</li>
    <li> The last time I tried this brand I found out the product made my hair very dry. Having curly hair I was excited to try this new product and so far I am not disappointed. The shampoo was very thick and rich and I was able to detangle my hair with ease. Plus, its smells amazing! After rinsing my hair was shiny and didn’t feel dry at all.  The scalp soother is awesome. I tried it two days after washing my hair and not only feels cool but also smells good! I was not a fan of this brand but this new line has changed my mind</li>
    <li> I use Head and Shoulder products all winter long to prevent flakes, but I can&#x27;t say I ever felt like I was treating myself or that it was a luxury product  because of the not so luxurious smell. However, the new Head and Shoulders Moisture line has made an improvement on it&#x27;s scent, which I have really enjoyed. The product itself doesn&#x27;t seem a whole lot different from the original Head and Shoulders, but the change in smell alone has convinced me to buy the new stuff next winter.</li>
    <li> I suffer from really, really bad dandruff, but since on the Head and Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 I have seen a drastic difference in my scalp. I would recommend this product to anyone she have the same issue as I do. It sure does work.</li>
    <li> If you have dandruff. Head and Shoulders Moisture 2 in 1 care collection works great. I have tried many products and this head and shoulders worked the best. We received head and shoulders moisture care from Bzzagent.com #gotitfree to try and I&#x27;m so happy we were picked because I am now able to wear hair styles longer due to not having to wash my hair every 3 days.</li>
    <li> I love this product it smells great I truly love it so much will definitely be buying more of it #moisturecare #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I already loved the Hair and Shoulders Brand. I got this product free from Head And Shoulders via BzzAgent. When I first used this product I was sorta skeptical because I had never heard of a 2 in 1 that&#x27;s also a dandruff product. It&#x27;s like sending little machines into my scalp that destroy the dandruff without drying my hair out. I love it! I am a curly girl with a moderate case of dandruff. It&#x27;s like a Godsend!</li>
    <li> I received the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Products free by BzzAgent, and must say I was pleasantly surprised. I was initially surprised that Head and Shoulders made hair care products for &amp;#34;textured hair&amp;#34;. The next surprise was the smell!  It smells sooo good. For  a product that promotes dandruff control, I expected a medicinal smell but this was not the case. I have dry scalp and even after washing my hair will notice dandruff developing. I used this product and have not seen one flake. I am impressed. I really recommend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free thanks to Bzzagent and Head &amp; Shoulder. I have dry, itchy scalp and there aren&#x27;t many products for African American hair that also treat these issues. That&#x27;s why I was so excited that Bzzagent chose me to try and review Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care line. Finally, a brand known for eliminating those pesky flakes, creates a line made specifically for textured hair! As you can tell from my pictures, my hair was in need for some heavy flake removal so I grabbed the Head &amp; Shoulders 2n1 shampoo and conditioner. First of all, the scent is amazing. It&#x27;s not too strong. The light coconut essence is very relaxing. I like that the 2n1 didn&#x27;t have that medicated smell to it like some other shampoos that target flakes. As I rubbed the shampoo in my scalp, I could feel that itchy sensation fading away. The shampoo rinsed out very easily. My hair felt great and didn&#x27;t feel like my hair had been stripped of moisture and oils.</li>
    <li> I received the product free from Head &amp; Shoulders to test. Having dry, course hair, its hard to find the right balance in shampoos and conditioners, they will leave my hair either dry and brittle or flat and greasy. After using this in conjunction with the co-wash, my hair is soft and flowy. The shampoo alone without the co-wash left my hair feeling a little dry. But, having course, natural African American hair, we need a creamy moisturizer  to complete the job. I am very satisfied so far. Usually, after I wash my hair, my scalp is terribly itchy and dry. I haven&#x27;t experience any of this days later.</li>
    <li> Before you purchase this product know that the consistency is very thick and creamy. I fell in love with the consistency cause I like to feel a shampoo in my hair. Needless to say I will not be purchasing this product in this line after my trial bottle is up because after 4 washes in 2 weeks it made my hair extremely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree: I received this a a free gift.</li>
    <li> I love this amazing product, i received it for free for review on bzzagent and it was amazing</li>
    <li> Having really curly hair means that you have tried products galore! I have never thought to try head and shoulders for two reasons: One, I don&#x27;t have a dandruff issue and Two, 2 in 1 shampoo conditioners are a big fail in the curly girls world. Well I have to tell you I was pleasantly surprised with this product. It cleans effectively, moisturizes thoroughly and smells light and lovely. My husband even noticed the smell.  I wasn&#x27;t brave enough to try this alone (without more conditioner) so I used it with the co-wash. Can we say AWESOME hair day!? :) My hair is so soft and my curls are defined. Nicely Done Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I was given a sample of this product to test and review*</li>
    <li> It took a while for me to find the right kind of shampoo w/ conditioner for me type of hair. When I tried the 2 in 1, I was instantly in love!!! 😍😍 My hair has been dandruff free and as soft as ever!! I will never use another...NO WAY!!!!</li>
    <li> I recently tried Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-1 free from Head &amp; Shoulders.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;m used to dandruff products leaving my hair feeling dry and grimy.  This was not the case with this product.  The coconut smell was a great touch as well.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> What a difference this product has made on my dry scalp. I have always struggled with dry scalp which in turn made my hair feel unhealthy. I recently received Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care for free as a part of a promotion from the brand. Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 has worked miracles on my scalp and its no longer dry and my hair feels and looks so healthy. If you are looking to bring life back to your hair while eliminated dry scalp, this product will work great.</li>
    <li> My daughter has really bad flakes and I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos and moisturizers a d nothing has really worked. She has been using the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection for almost a week now and it seems to be helping. I received the products for free through BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I am completely in love with the Co-Wash! The tingle and dandruff have just given my scalp LIFE!</li>
    <li> After receiving this product for free to try, I used it and it worked on my curly hair to add moisture to my scalp and hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is mild and not stripping, it worked well for my coily hair texture and helped me to have less flakes with continuous use.</li>
    <li> I had a chance to try this product out for free and for the most part I love the way it added moisture to my scalp but really didn&#x27;t like the way it left my actual hair feeling. It relieved my hair of itching and left a great scent!</li>
    <li> I have mixed hair that&#x27;s short and curly. The 2-in-1 didn&#x27;t do much for my curls but it definitely helped with the dandruff. I saw dandruff results in a few weeks which was great! Plus it smells good!</li>
    <li> I received Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner from BzzAgent to try for free and I love it. It left my hair moisturized but not weighed down. I will be purchasing this very soon and recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love easy hair care. So, when I got the opportunity to try this 2 in 1 Conditioner from Head &amp; Shoulders through BzzAgent I was all up on it. I wanted to say I love it, but I didn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t hate it, when I paired it with my usual routine of a leave in conditioner and a coconut oil and olive oil mixture at the end my hair was moisturized and kept it&#x27;s moisture for at least four days no oil touch up needed. It also was true to it&#x27;s claim of relieving an itchy scalp though probably not as long as needed for most Black girls, who aren&#x27;t washing their hair daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you may be wondering why I wasn&#x27;t blown away. Well it&#x27;s simple because I love simple hair care routines as I mentioned before. I detangle in the shower with my conditioner. This 2 in 1 lacks the amount of slip needed to detangle, so it didn&#x27;t wow me enough to have me breakup with my current conditioner and shampoo. So, for that reason I probably wouldn&#x27;t go out and buy it.</li>
    <li> I have received this product for review through Bzzagent. I have used this product and discovered that I like it. I have thick course hair and it takes a lot to moisturize my hair so after I washed and dried my hair I did have to add my own moisturizer to my hair but over all I like it. This product has made my hair feel clean and my scalp feel good and not itchy.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free and these opinions are 100% my own.  I recieved this product for free from Bzz agent.  I was really excited about this new line for ethnic hair.  It does help relieve the itchy scalp but since i have really thick hair this product left my hair really ratted and hard to brush through without using a conditioner. The second time i used this w a conditioner i found it was easier to brush my hair. It doesnt dry my hair out like ive seen others say. I really love the coconut smell ad well. I have recommend to my friends however i havent been able to find this product at my local Walmart.</li>
    <li> I received this free from BzzAgent to test and give my feedback. I don&#x27;t typically like dandruff shampoos, especially 2-in-1s. The only one I would use was Avon Advanced Techniques. I think this Moisture Care 2-in-1 is a good one. It gently cleansed my hair without stripping it of moisture. That is the main problem I&#x27;ve always had with dandruff shampoos. It rinses pretty clean as well which surprised me. Even though it is not SLS-free (why no five star review) I would use it again.</li>
    <li> I received my product as a BzzAgent promotion from Head &amp; Shoulders.This product was nice and refreshing on my hair, and it kept it feeling good throughout the day. The best part of course is no flakes to be seen since I started using this product. Not sure what exactly makes the &#x27;textured&#x27; part different from it&#x27;s other products, but it was nice and smelled good.</li>
    <li> Im in love with this product. I would have never tried this on my own but I was picked by bzzzagent. Great thing about that is my daughter has coarse superthick dry hair. This 2 and 1 has helped to restore moisture and along with her medicated oil we have battled the skin condition. We did one month of use and now it haz been 2 weeks of nothing and the big flakey dandruff have yet to return. We are going to continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have used head and shoulder product for years now,and I&#x27;ve received the head and shoulder complete care through the buzz agent and once again head and shoulder rocks..</li>
    <li> This shampoo + conditioner smells awesome! It did not leave my natural hair feeling stripped or crunchy, although I would have loved for it to leave a little more moisture in my hair. It was made for textured hair and they did a good job!! My hair and scalp was left feeling clean and fresh. No flakes. No irritation. Just clean, moisturized hair. Check out my video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;cS_kXYBLzTQ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**My review was not a paid review. I was sent the product by #bzzagent to test for free #gotitfree. My honest opinion is that this line is awesome!</li>
    <li> I received this free from bzzagent! I normally purchase head n shoulders shampoo so when I received these products I was already familiar with what the results should be. I am not a Fan of 2 in 1 products but this one was okay. I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in what just the shampoo does.</li>
    <li> i received this product for free from bzzagent. in return i have to share my honest opinion about this product. This product left my hair nice and soft, and flake free. I really love the smell of it as well. This will forever be stocked in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of a brand promotion from BzzAgent and used it product immediately on my dry, unruly hair. I have naturally thick, curly and super coarse hair so anything with added moisture is great. My hair literally sucks up moisturizers and is often very dry and extremely matted. I&#x27;ve tried many different products to help and was thrilled when I received this one from BzzAgent. I really dug the smell as just as much as the other products in the line. It has this great coconut scent with a really clean after tone. After the initial wash, my hair felt smooth, moisturized and de-tangled. For me personally, the moisturizing of the actual hair, was the most alluring. My hair is constantly dry and as I live in an extremely dry state, so getting even a small bit of extra moisture can be difficult. With this product, I was able to get that extra moisture without the added heaviness of fillers. I&#x27;ve used this product 2 times now and am still impressed with the amount of moisture it seems to be yielding. I really enjoyed the product overall and would recommend this specifically for women/men/children with thicker, dryer hair.</li>
    <li> So, I received my free, full size bottle from BzzAgent in the mail. My family and I used the full Moisture Care line for a month. My overall opinion on the 2-1 Shamp/Cond: MEH. It was great the first few uses, but I didnt really fall in love with this one.</li>
    <li> I am very please with using head and shoulders for textured hair. my hair feels refreshed and  moisturized. I am very pleased to have tried this product. i got to try this product for free from head and shoulder.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and have nothing bad to say about it. I got the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture care 2 in 1 shampoo  try as part of promotion from the brand and was impressed with it. This shampoo is supposed to help with dandruff and that it did. I also loved the fact that it did not over dry my hair at all. I&#x27;ve used other antidandruff shampoos and usually find them to be sort of drying and non foaming but this one was the opposite. My hair felt great and there was definitely foam as I washed.</li>
    <li> This came right on time for me. I was experiencing the worst hair extension allergic reaction in my life. The extensions left me with a scalp that was flaky, damaged, and nasty. The 2 in 1 went right to work and did what it was supposed to do. My scalp itching decreased drastically and my scalp felt a million times better. I received this free from head and shoulders.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of the 2 in 1. I am an african American women who has natursl hair and it stripped my hair of moisture. It also was kinda tangled up. It did however lighten my itchy scalp</li>
    <li> Hi I tries the moisture 2 in 1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner,&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely loved it. It was a promotion that I ha d tried it for free.&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair with plenty of moisture. I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> My hair felt so moisturized after using this product. My hair is usually so dry and flakey and I have yet to find a product to remedy it until now. I love this 2-in-1  shampoo + conditioner. It get the job done!!</li>
    <li> I got sent this product by bzzagent.com and i have to say it made my scalp feel so good and clean. It didnt imediately start itching once dry. Idk if i would claim as must moisture as it says but it doesnt feel dry.</li>
    <li> I received my product from BzzAgent, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the 2in1 shampoo. It has a great scent, it lathers up very good. It left my hair with a fresh clean feel.</li>
    <li> Most people love my hair because it its naturally coily state and also I love products that smell like coconut! That gets them every time. And I just told them I was currently reviewing Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture care collection that I received free from BuzzAgent. And it gets rid of the itchy , flakey scalp that some of them may have , and it moistures really well!</li>
    <li> I tried this received this product from BzzAgent and I am glad I signed up to try it.  In our house we have several people with dandruff and flaky and dry scalp.  It really help provide moisture and help keep the hair manegable.  I was very surprised that that Head and Shoulders was able to do this much when other products could not touch the problem. Not only did it solve our dandruff problem but I also notice that our hair is a lot more shiny as well which was really never possible before.</li>
    <li> I used the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2- in- 1  that i got from Bzzagent and I Loved it.This is a great product for reducing or removing dandruff and improving hair quality overall. Also, it made my hair feel very clean but at the same time very moisturized.I was a bit skeptical when trying out this product as my hair is a little picky about what I put on it. However; this product made my hair light, fluffy, and super soft. My scalp felt so cleansed after using this product. It didn&#x27;t feel as though it was stripping my hair, but replenished it.I would recomend this product to anyone  who has textured hair,and i will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, its not like most products for dandruff that give you that dry feeling afterwards, it actually moisturize your hair and leave it feeling soft</li>
    <li> I tried the Head &amp; Shoulder Moisture Care 2-in-1 product compliments of BzzAgent and Head &amp; Shoulder. The product was thicker than your normal shampoo and you could tell was medicated, but had a p,easing smell. I did find that it did not provide as much lather as your normal shampoo, but nota deal breaker. The initial use of this product was favorable. It provided a soft feel to my hair while using in the shower. So, I was sure it&#x27;s claim to moisturize would come through. I finished off the use of this product with the Co-wash. My disappointment came in the final result where my hair did not look or feel moisturized at all after blow drying and straightening. I did find it reduced flakes, but that did not last long as they came back within 3 days. For me, I will stick to my usual product. However, some may find that this works for them.</li>
    <li> Got this product via BzzAgent. Let me be the first to admit I&#x27;m more of a conditioner/co-wash kind of gal, and avoid shampoos as much as possible, but I used this with an open mind because trying new products is always exciting. Was it anything amazing? No. Was it better than most other shampoos? Yes. It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair as much as other shampoos and got rid of most, if not all the flakes, the first go round. However, I had to use a lot of it just to feel as if my hair was being cleaned, legit about half of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use this again occasionally, like once every two weeks, but will stick to their co-wash product (which is great btw) and won&#x27;t buy this for myself in future.</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. Head and shoulders 2-in-1 has a great smell and it really does clean the scalp. This is just what my hair needs. I&#x27;ve used this product twice and i am hooked. This is for textured hair but i know it will do great on any texture. My hair is not hard after shampooing it and i don&#x27;t have to be reaching for a conditioner right after.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product with the Co-wash as well to get the better result. Go ahead and get your hair clean.refreshed and flake-free.</li>
    <li> This product is okay I don&#x27;t think two in ones are good for ethnic hair. I stopped using shampoo in my hair expect for about once every other month to really clean my hair. This cleans it good I guess because my hair is stripped of the softness and mositure. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll use this again because I only co wash now. But I love the other products in this line they leave my hair soft and Mositurized. I received this free from head and shoulders.</li>
    <li> I received the product free from Head &amp; Shoulders. I think this product worked very well! And it smells amazing. Within a week i started to see better results and my head didn&#x27;t itch as much. Also i didn&#x27;t see as much flakes. If you&#x27;re looking for a good hair product to get rid of dandruff this is it. It&#x27;s the best one i&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I did receive this product free from buzzagent, thanks to buzz agent I got to try full size bottles of the new head and shoulder hair care product, on my terms.&lt;br /&gt; I liked head &amp; shoulder moisture care 2 in 1, its however it did not get rid of all my flakes on the first time but I did make my hair feel great, and that&#x27;s a plus, maybe with more washes my hair will be flake fee because I used it 3 times already and no flakes. I suffer from extreme dandruff. I am really picky about what hair products I use and I have to say that I will surely add head &amp; shoulder moisture care 2 in 1 to my list of hair care products.</li>
    <li> I received Head &amp; Shoulders 2 in 1, co-wash, scalp soother, and a $3 coupon for free as a Bzzagent.  I&#x27;ve used the shampoo and co-wash in my hair, which is slightly wavy and my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is tight curls.  It cleans our hair great, smells fabulous, and looks great afterwards.  Only complaint is 2 in 1 leaves our hair full of tangles.  We must use additional conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> I used this along with the co wash and scalp relief spray and i like the whole package together ( i received it fee through bzzagent).  However i&#x27;m sure i can do without this shampoo...and even the co-wash.  I didn&#x27;t really notice anything too special about this shampoo, it didn&#x27;t change my hair or scalp from what i can tell</li>
    <li> I got this product for free from Head&amp; Shoulders my husband love it works great!!!</li>
    <li> I received the head and shoulders courtesy of bzzagent. I have only so far used the 2in1 moisture care.  Which seemed to work pretty well.  I have a really hard time with moisture in my hair.  But my scalp was not as itchy as it would normally be after washing work other products that i have used.  Would recommend to people if asked.</li>
    <li> I received from product Free from Head &amp; Shoulders as a Bzzagent. I recently removed a protective style, as my hair is natural and super kinky. I was really excited to try this. I love the scent. A little too &#x27;perfumey&#x27; for me but it really cleansed my scalp. My hair smelled amazing afterwards. I normally try to stick to products without sulfates, dyes, parabens,cruelty free etc. This didn&#x27;t mention any of that.&lt;br /&gt;That aspect of the product was a let down for me since I want my hair to retain moisture and I want the least chemicals in my hair products. I prefer more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was a good product. I&#x27;m happy I tried it and will probably use it again.</li>
    <li> My scalp is prone to dandruff and to become very itchy. This product have lessen both of these issues while not drying out my natural 3c-4a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand</li>
    <li> I immediately noticed a difference when I used the Moisture Care shampoo. My hair was easier to comb through while wet and was no where near as dry when I blow dried it. Usually it&#x27;s brittle but the moisture care was wonderful. I got it from bzzagent as a free sample for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have very course and curly/kinky natural hair, which tends to be dry if not conditioned routinely. I&#x27;m always up for trying out new products(I got this Head and Shoulders Moisture Care line free from Head and Shoulders), especially those developed for &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; hair. Unfortunately, I- and my hair- were left unsatisfied. When I heard about Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Line, I thought, &amp;#34;Great, here&#x27;s something that will give my hair the moisture it definitely needs, and look-coconut oil!&amp;#34; Yeah, okay so it didn&#x27;t say it had coconut oil(just &amp;#34;coconut essence??) in the actual product, but the bottle clearly shows coconuts- a bit deceiving. Well, upon reading the ingredients, I noticed a lot of different alcohols, no coconut oil, almond oil was the FIFTH ingredient from the bottom, and red, blue, and yellow dye!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how was it?? Well, I tried this product twice, the first time I tried it, I had no real issues, my hair was not left too dry or too tangled, and my hair and scalp were left feeling clean. I must note, however, that I had previously deep conditioned my hair a week before with a different product. The Head in shoulders Moisture Care 2-in1 and co-wash was just okay, nothing that I would replace what I currently use for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the second time I tried the Head and Shoulders Moisture Care line, my hair was once again in need of a deep conditioning. I used the Head and Shoulders Moisture Care 2in1 and Co-wash, instead of my usual go to for when my hair is extra thirsty. This time, however my hair was left extremely dull and dry, it was worse than before I washed it! I had to rewash all of the product out with a different line that I routinely use, and I had to use a hot oil treatment to restore the moisture in my hair that was lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I don&#x27;t think it is a good product for those with dry, course, curly, and fragile hair. I would have given this product 2 stars, however, the ingredients and what I feel is deceptive packaging is why I give it 1 star.</li>
    <li> I receieved this product for free courtesy of Head &amp; Shoulders and BzzAgent. First of all, it smells amazing. Its so luscious and smooth. I love how it makes my hair feel. I have very textured hair and my hair is so smooth. Usually when I wash my hair a lot of hair comes out, but this time barely any came out. which quite surprised me.</li>
    <li> I tried this 2-in-1 moisture care for free and in return I will give my own honest opinion.  I used this product every day for a couple of days and noticed the product build up and dandruff almost gone after the 3rd day.  This product smells good (not like other dandruff products that have that chemical smell).  You can smell coconut and no chemicals.  I color my hair and this did not remove any of the color from it.  My hair felt smooth and soft after using.&lt;br /&gt;Right now I am using Head and Shoulders 2-in-1 twice a week as maintenance to help keep my scalp healthy and moisturized.  I am satisfied with the results and recommend this to anyone with thicker/textured hair that needs dandruff removal, product build up removal along with a heavy dose of moisture.</li>
    <li> I love using something and seeing results right away and that&#x27;s what I got from using Head and Shoulders Moisture Care 2 in 1. After using my hair and scalp looked and felt healthier, it was not as dry as my hair usually is and my scalp has no longer been flaky. I will continue to use this in the future. I was able to try this for free thanks to Head and Shoulders</li>
    <li> I liked this product, it was a pleasant surprise and a nice change from the old H &amp; S formula from years ago.</li>
    <li> I was sent this by bzzagent for free to test out and do a review, I can  honestly say I love this product. My scalp is moisturize and doesn&#x27;t feel itchy just after one use. I was very worried that this would dry out my hair. But it left it feeling soft and smelling great!! I&#x27;ve used this 3 times so far, and my hair is still loving it.</li>
    <li> I received the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 Shampoo for free through BzzAgent to try and review. This 2-in-1 shampoo works really well. It has a creamy consistency that threw me off, but it lathers well. My hair felt exceptionally clean and soft with just the shampoo. I don&#x27;t have dandruff, at least that I&#x27;ve seen or been told about, but I&#x27;ve had a dry itchy scalp lately and this really soothed that.</li>
    <li> I received the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 free for being a BZZ Agent. My husband was getting dandruff as the summer was approaching. Just as I was about to go buy this, I got an opportunity to test it out. I thought it worked great. My husband said it worked &amp;#34;pretty good&amp;#34; and also said it gave his hair moisture. I have noticed that he no longer has dandruff and his hair is softer. He is African American and Sicilian.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Head and Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 free as a promotion for the Head &amp; Shoulders company. The opinions in this review are 100% my own. I can honestly say before I used the product I was very skeptical that it wouldn&#x27;t be any better than my normal shampoo and conditioner that I use, but I was surprised by how well it worked all together. Being a woman of color I have to find the right products that will work with my texture of hair. The complete system has to be used together to get the overall affect I needed for my type of hair. My hair is long and it soaks up moisture so I need extra conditioner regardless of the brand and the Head &amp; Shoulders moisture system provides that much needed boost. The 2-in-1 really cleans your hair deeply, but it leaves it leaves it tangled. This means you have to use the Head &amp; Shoulders Co-wash to detangle and complete the moisture needed if have a hair type like mine. Overall I was impressed by the complete look that the Head &amp;Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 provided. It also has a strong long lasting coconut smell that I truly enjoyed I would definitely use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I received Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 free from Head &amp; Shoulders and BzzAgent. I absolutely love the fragrance of this one. It&#x27;s really hard for me to find shampoo and conditioners that work with both my curls and my dandruff. It&#x27;s even harder for me to enjoy the convenience of two in one shampoo/conditioner with my hair and scalp needs. Head &amp; Shoulders knocked it out of the ballpark with this one. I don&#x27;t think this would be the greatest product for hair straitening, but if you are like me and like wearing natural curls, this is the product to beat. I love it. :)</li>
    <li> I tried the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo+Conditioner as a promotional offer from Bzzagent to test out.I love this product as it does as it says.  I have thick course hair with a itchy scalp at times the added moisture was very helpful. My hair soaks up everything I usually put in my hair to help so fast and as soon as I used this product i knew it worked it made my hair moisturized and really smooth feeling. I love the coconut smell it makes your hair smell wonderful and feel great. I would buy this product for use every time and I would recommend to anyone with a dry itchy scalp</li>
    <li> As a sufferer of itchy dry scalp for many many years, I&#x27;ve always been in search of a shampoo and conditioner that would moisturize my textured hair but also ease the itchy dryness of my scalp. I&#x27;ve tried dermatologist prescribed shampoos but never felt comfortable using something medicated for long periods of time. I had given up on my search because I didn&#x27;t want to compromise the quality of my hair for the comfort and appearance of my scalp, until I met this product as a trial through BzzAgent. My hair felt much cleaner and easier to tame after the use of this shampoo and my scalp not only felt less itchy with less dandruff outbreaks  but also cleaner. I also noticed my scalp becoming less and less dry and itchy with increased use throughout the past weeks. Can&#x27;t beat a product that&#x27;s also safe to use daily over long periods of time.  I only wash my hair twice a week but I have noticed less and less irritation throughout the day since receiving these products.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free from Buzz Agent... this has to be the worst product for natural&lt;br /&gt;hair... This product dried my hair completely out... I will not buy this product nor recommend&lt;br /&gt;it. I can say my scalp was extremely clean...</li>
    <li> Just tried my new Head and Shoulders Moisture care collection from my Bzz Agent Promotion the other day and I love it. The shampoo left my hair manageable and the conditioner made my hair feel like butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A day later i used the scalp soother and it worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this collection :-)</li>
    <li> The 2-in1 was richer and thicker than I anticipated.  It left my hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I received this new product Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection courtesy of my friendly neighborhood BzzAgent!!! I have naturally thick, curly and coarse hair so anything with added moisture is great for my hair. I am giving this product five star because its a great brand, leaves hair smelling good and moist, and it helps maintain dandruff. Which makes this product a super in my book. I like everything about this product.</li>
    <li> So I was thoroughly excited to try this new product by Head &amp; Shoulders that I received free courtesy of BzzAgent.  I washed my hair using the 2-in-1 Mositure Care for textured hair.  The fragrance was okay, and it got my hair clean... I thought that it was a good match; until the next day when my scalp was dry and itchy.  The shampoo also left my hair very dry and didn&#x27;t really give it any extra moisture.  I use head &amp; shoulders on a regular basis because of my scalp, and this actually disappointed me. I am not sure why it didn&#x27;t work as well as my other head &amp; shoulders, but it is not a complete dud. It could be just not a right match for me!! Thanks again though for the ability to try it out.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free from bzzagent. Unfortunately the 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner from head and shoulders left my hair feeling dry, I felt like it stripped all the oils from my hair, so this is not best for my coarse hair texture.</li>
    <li> This 2 in 1 agreed very well with my hair the smell is amazing and it left my hair VERY clean without feeling like it stripped away my hair natural oils and bouncy also I got this product for free which Im happy I got to try and will most definatly be buying more when I run out!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product, the head and shoulders 2 in 1 moisture care. I received it as part of a free campaign from bzzagent.com . My hair felt really nourished and moisturized after using this product and not dull and dry like i expected. I used this on my daughter as well. she normally suffers from an itchy scalp and after using this her complaints lessened and are almost nonexistent.She also keeps her hair braided a lot and the scalp soother was perfect to alleviate her scalp itch.  I love it!</li>
    <li> After receiving this as part of a BzzAgent Challenge, I was pleasantly surprised that this didn&#x27;t dry out my hair as much as I thought it would. I usually can&#x27;t use 2-in-1 shampoos by themselves because it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for these curls. While I still wasn&#x27;t able to use this just by itself, this didn&#x27;t leave my hair nearly as brittle and tangled as a lot of other 2-in-1s do once I rinse. I think this product would be ideal for people who have straight hair and wash their hair every other day.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free as part of a campaign for #BzzAgent &amp; #Head&amp;Shoulders. My very first time using this product, it actually caused my scalp to flake more than it usually does and it also left my hair feeling kind of dry, but then I used the Moisture Care Co-Wash after and it made my hair feel a little softer. After my first use I really didn&#x27;t like the product, but I gave it a second shot and a third and so on and it works really great on my hair. I haven&#x27;t seen a single flake in my hair and now when I use it my hair feels moisturized. My personal experience is that my hair just needed to get used to this product. I love the smell and texture of this product and the Moisture Care Co-Wash. I like how this product doesn&#x27;t lather too much and it&#x27;s very easy to distribute throughout my hair and rinses out very well. It leaves my hair feeling very clean. I would recommend this product to my family and friends and I would tell them to not give up on the first try because it does get better with a few more uses.</li>
    <li> I have mixed (black and white) hair that I wear natural and straight. I got this product free from Head &amp; Shoulders for free to test and review, this did not influence my opinion. I liked this 2 in 1 because it is so different from other ones I have tried in the past. They left my hair dry, heavy and tangled up so bad!. I was cautious of trying this. This product gave the perfect amount of both shampoo and conditioner. It cleansed my hair clean as well as conditioned to the max. It did not weigh my hair down or leave any residue or build-up. It left and kept my hair hydrated from root to ends without compromising my style or making my scalp itch. It kept the irritation away so I can focus on my day</li>
    <li> This is Great! Happy to see on their website that it&#x27;s ph balanced for chemically treated hair---they should add that line to the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The Coconut Essence smells Great--Tropical--Soft, light and relaxing! And the almond oil leaves my hair and scalp nicely moisturized.</li>
    <li> I got this for free to review about 2 mos ago, and I have to say I really like this product. I don&#x27;t tend to use shampoo on my head more than once a month, but this one I actually use once a week. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out, it smells like a beach, and it has a really great texture. When it comes to dandruff control, this is actually the first product I&#x27;ve ever used that helps me control the flakes. When I wash my hair with this, it feels hydrated and soft, and I find that my scalp doesn&#x27;t it for at least 5 days, especially when used in conjunction with toe other products in this line.</li>
    <li> I tried and like this product a lot. Since I am a natural I need things that are good for my hair and this product is one of them. I also received it free form Head &amp; shoulders which is a bonus in itself!! Thank you head&amp;shoulders my head and I are happy now...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Head &amp; Shoulders before for my dandruff issues. It got rid of my dandruff but it had a funny smell and it felt like I was putting chemicals in  my hair. I used other anti-dandruff shampoos like Clear Complete and found it kept dandruff away and felt better in my hair than the old Head &amp; Shoulders. I&#x27;m so glad that Bzzagent give me a chance to try this new Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoo and Conditioner for free. I admit I wasn&#x27;t really looking forward to it due to my last experience. After trying it I really loved it! The shampoo and conditioner are really moisturizing and felt silky in my hair. It had a pretty floral scent and no chemical smell. It&#x27;s like they addressed all my previous concerns. According to the bottle it still has the same anti-dandruff ingredients in it. My hair felt and smelled great afterwards with no dandruff issues.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to have the opporunity to try thi product for free and without a doubt I was skeptical about it.....Head and Shoulders have been around for years yet it might work, it always cleared the dandruff and left my hair very dry....In the case of this product I was shocked...Not only does it remove the dandruff on contact but it kept my hair moistured for days...I would recommend it to all it truely is the best...</li>
    <li> I was skeptic at first but I actually like this! It burns like heck but it gets rid of the dandruff. Must have! After one use I was able to see a difference. My scalp is sensitive, gets irritated easily and is very dry. I think I have found a new product for my hair! #MoistureCare and #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this this is definitely not your old dandruff shampoo. You see a difference within days. Even after the first shampoo your hair is healthy and shiny. I will definitely buy this again. I got this for free to do an independent review.</li>
    <li> I got this product from BzzAgent for free. I used this product in hopes to making my hair moistured, but I feel like it strips the oils out of my hair more than anything. To me it&#x27;s more of a clarifying shampoo and conditioner. Because it&#x27;s good to use clarifying shampoo and conditioner once a month I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Its OK I #got it free through buzz agent and I like it but it still leaves my hair kind of dry</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 3+ years now and for the most part; I keep to my staples (pantene natural hair line). I wanted too try a new natural products, so I&#x27;made currently trying the Shea moisture line. lately I&#x27;ve been dealing with a itchy scalp (dry climate) wanted too buy something that would help. A few weeks ago I was offered in opportunity too be apart of the head &amp; shoulders for textured hair campaign hosted by bzzagent. First I started with the 2-1 moisture care with vitamin email rich almond and coconut essence. After the first usage I felt like the itching was actually calming. I have my hair in twist so I thought why not give  it a try. My hair suprisingly, after two days with only water and a little conditioner is very soft and it smells good. I was a little hesitant  too try the brand, but it&#x27;s actually not that bad. I wouldn&#x27;t use it every wash, but probably once a month. not bad head &amp; shoulders it&#x27;s actually pretty good. I would recommend this product too others who have thick hair or whose dealing with a itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free from BzzAgent! I was very surprised with the results I received from Head &amp; Shoulders. This was never a product that I had used in the past becasue I thought that it was just for people who had dandruff. But I have a dry and sometimes itchy scalp and this did the trick. Not only does it smell fantastic but it left my scalp feeling clean and mosturized. I did however not notice any real difference in my hair itself. It seemed to be its usual dry self. But I use other products for that. I think this is a great wash to use in combo with other mosturizing products for the hair specifically.</li>
    <li> My daughter has had dandruff and dry itchy scalp for years, we&#x27;ve tried everything -Denorex (hate the smell), extra conditioner (too greasy)- you name it! We&#x27;ve most recently tried Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care and have become forever users. The smell is beautiful, light, and refreshing. Her hair is smoother than ever, even without the co-wash being used. We&#x27;ve noticed significantly less flakes (almost none!) and her scalp is not even slightly itchy any more. Noticed results within one week. Priced lower than other relatable shampoos. win-win! #gotitfree #thankshead&amp;shoulders</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I definitely felt that my hair was more moisturized.  I have tried other dandruff products, but it left my scalp irritated.  This product didn&#x27;t leave my scalp irritated.  My hair and scalp felt good I washed my hair.  Head and Shoulders didn&#x27;t strip my hair of my natural oils and that&#x27;s what I was mostly  worried about.  This product was sent to me for review purposes.  Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care was sent free from Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
    <li> I received this hair product for free from the company but in no way will I lie about the product. It smells really great, but I often worried about the product stripping my hair. My husband loved it, as he is already a head and shoulders fan. I think they could have done a little better. This shampoo was great for when I went to the beach and needed a quick wash.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review as a member of BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve used my free sample of this 2 in 1 shampoo and my hair doesn&#x27;t like it. Most 2 in 1 shampoos don&#x27;t agree with my hair and this one is no different. I wanted to like this product but it dries out my hair. I like the cowash though. Thank you for allowing me to try this product.</li>
    <li> I received this new product Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection courtesy of BzzAgent. I should make known first that I don&#x27;t suffer from dandruff. First and foremost, I don&#x27;t know how much these products cost ($3.83 according to amazon), but you&#x27;re getting the bang for your buck!These bad boys are filled to the very top! I gave this product a 3 star because I&#x27;m not a fan of 2 in 1, I prefer each product separately, so I may come off a little bit bias when reviewing this product. However, when washing my thick, coarse hair, my hair did not feel stripped of oils after rinsing it out, which is a plus for me. I love creamy products, and this is creamy. I must admit though, that I still had to add a little bit of my own conditioner to my hair to really get that moisturized feeling I&#x27;m so used to having. Out of all three products, I like this one the least.</li>
    <li> First let me say I don’t make it a habit of posting photos of 10 day old hair. LOL However I just had to share, I have really been loving the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother. I have been using for the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother for some weeks now and feel I can really speak on the product now. So a little background about Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother: - Infused with Peppermint oil complex for a calm cooling sensation. - Has ProVitamin E antioxidants for a healthier scalp. - Has ProVitamin B5 to help the look and feel of hair. - Has ProVitamin B3 which has moisturizing benefits. - Provides relief on contact. - Can be found on the shelves in local stores and online. I have r.r. - Has ProVitamin B3 which has moisturizing benefits. - Provides relief on contact. - Can be found on the shelves in local stores and online. I have used the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother after a fresh wash , in between washes, and when my scalp feels itchy. Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother definitely delivers on each of their claims, which greatly exceeded my expectations. Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother works fantastically and is comparable to that of another high end natural brand that cost two times as much. Upon taking it out of the box I was really pleased with the size, you definitely get a lot of bang for your buck. Also when you spray the product it doesn’t drip, clog, or get messy which I can appreciate. I really love the nozzle on this bottle you can pump it and the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother goes directly where you want it. I prefer to use this product after I just washed my hair because, I find it really invigorating it definitely wakes my scalp up. With continuous use of the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother along with the other products in the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Line I have seen great improvement in my hair and scalp. Most recently I was getting ready to wash my hair after putting it off for longer than usual and was literally amazed. As I began to take loose the the two strand twist I couldn’t believe my shirt wasn’t covered in flakes, and how well moisturized my hair was (hence the photo). I usually like to wash my hair once a week but life happens, and I couldn’t and before I knew what happened 10 days had went by. In that time I been spraying my scalp with the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother and moisturizing the ends of my hair. There was very minimal flaking aside from my problem areas ( the sides of head, and directly in the center) which I largely attribute that to Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother.

    <li> This is such a great product! I got this for free to try out in my bzz kit, and i am so happy they sent it to me! I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo and conditioner duo and this is the perfect one. my hair texture is not the easiest to deal with and i always try to use natural hair products and this product lived up to my wants and needs. i love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stripped like other brands do. its so moisturizing and my hair feels so soft after using it. i have already recommended it all of my family and friends and i will definitely re-purchase this.</li>
    <li> I received Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care as a free sample from bzz agent. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. Most dandruff shampoos leave your hair hard dry or it leaves your hair clean but doesn&#x27;t work on the dandruff.  They have a winning here. Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care both removed dandruff and gives a nice sheen. On top of that it leaves your hair smelling great!</li>
    <li> I recieved the Head &amp; shoulders moisture care 2 in 1 shampoo + conditoner for free from head &amp; shoulders.  Its grate…  It works really good on textured hair I would buy this product because it helps my dandruff I don&#x27;t itch or have flaks, and I love it….. try now for a free full products from bzzagent. I rated it a 5 star because it really works grate</li>
    <li> head and shoulders moistue care is a great shampoo it helps u fight flakes so u can  wear what u want #igoritfree from buzzagent.com it smells good like coconut  plus its a whole line of products u can try out and i have a 3 off coupon .</li>
    <li> Creamy and smells great. My hair needs alot of conditioner shampooing alone or using other 2-in-1&#x27;s leaves it pretty dry, but this stuff left alot of moisture behind. Still needed to condition, but my hair wasn&#x27;t dried out</li>
    <li> I received the product free from Head &amp; Shoulders to test. Having dry, course hair, its hard to find the right balance in shampoos and conditioners, they will leave my hair either dry and brittle or flat and greasy. After using this in conjunction with the co-wash, my hair is soft and bouncy. It has satisfied me very well so far</li>
    <li> Received this product from BZZ AGENT. The product was not special, slightly disappointed hoping this could have replace salon brands that gives my hair more moisture and soften the better. It did seem to help a little better then the average retail store brand.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product curtesy of Buzzagent to review. The 2 in 1 was less than satisfactory. The shampoo/conditioneer is for &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; hair. This product left  my curls feelings dry and less then conditioned. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is MAGIC in a  BOTTLE!!!!! Love it!!! I got this product free from head &amp; shoulders as a bzzagent and this product is an all in one for my hair. It got rid of my dandruff completely on the first wash. Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like a lot of shampoos and it smells nice. My hair feels soft now which is great! It&#x27;s better to use this 2 in 1 product than a separate conditioner because having a lot of hair and being pretty long it saves me a lot of  time.</li>
    <li> This product was given to me as a product to try by BZZagent.com. The product, &amp;#34;Moisture Care 2-in-1 is formulated with vitamin E-rich almond oil and coconut essence to deliver enriched moisture to your scalp, giving you deeply hydrated, flake-free* hair and scalp. The shampoo + conditioner fights dry scalp, calms itchy scalp**, relieves irritation**, reduces redness**, controls flaky scalp** and leaves hair looking beautiful and smelling great.&amp;#34; Does are its claims. I have a dry itchy scalp but I didn&#x27;t think it made any spectacular change so am giving it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I have been using Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in 1 for over a month now and I can honestly say it’s amazing. I&#x27;m African American with tex-laxed bra length hair and I usually wear my hair straight. With that being said let’s get into the PROs and CONs.  First, this product left my hair feeling soft, which is not the case when using most dandruff products. Second, it left my hair extra shiny but not oily which gave it an extra bounce. In most cases, dandruff products have left my hair either extra dry or heavy and flat, but this moister care system was different. Lastly, this product kept the dandruff away for about a week. This may seem like a short period of time to some, but my scalp is usually extra dry and starts to flake around day 2 post washing. Overall this product was great, it has an amazing Caribbean-like coconut smell and its very thick and easy to apply. I would definitely recommend to my sisters of color. Thanks to bzzagent I was able to try this product for free and was given extra coupons for friends  #gotitforfree</li>
    <li> I received this for free from BzzAgent part of the Moisture Care Collection, I have thick course hair and this worked wonders for me. I&#x27;m always looking for a shampoo that adds moisture instead of stripping it from my hair and this worked extremely well. Very pleased with smell and overall appearance of my hair. I would highly recommend for thick course hair.</li>
    <li> the 2 in 1 i used on my natural hair before getting braids and i did like it but it dry out my hair so you have to used a trustworthy conditioner afterwards but it did stop my flakes and itchy scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product from bzzagent for free</li>
    <li> This is  a great product for reducing or removing dandruff and improving hair quality overall.  The 2-in-1 nature of this product also helps make showering faster and easier, which is important in my busy work day.  I&#x27;ve always thought there was no way for my hair/scalp to ever feel properly moisturized and I was going to be stuck with so-so hair for the rest of my life.  Since discovering Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection I have realized that I can have the hair I want!  This shampoo is like a big drink of water for your scalp and hair!  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I tried this product free from buzz agent. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! Used it for a few days now and have to say I am highly impressed! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This product needs more moisture. Left my hair feeling rough .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not someone to use 2 in 1&#x27;s because I prefer to separate my shampooing from my conditioning. But because I got this as a BzzAgent Campaign promotion, I decided to try it, especially since the cowash wasn&#x27;t that bad. I used this but I didn&#x27;t really like it. My scalp did feel clean afterwards but my hair wasn&#x27;t as moisturized as I would&#x27;ve like it to be.</li>
    <li> I received the product free from Head &amp; Shoulders to sample. My hair is natural so I stay away from products containing sulfates. This product contained both sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate. the shampoo left my with a fresh squeaky clean feeling but it also dried my hair out. i don&#x27;t think this is the best product for me.</li>
    <li> I liked it it&#x27;s a 2-1 that&#x27;s works clean hair and scalp with moisture you can feel when done! A little product goes a long way</li>
    <li> I have always been pretty leery about trying any 2-in-1 product, especially shampoo and conditioner since they tend to dry out my hair. This was no different. Left my hair very dry but at the end of the day, I can&#x27;t complain. I have had a dandruff problem, especially with as dry as it is here in SoCal (thanks drought!) and this really helped soothe my scalp. I&#x27;ve used it a few times in the last week and I&#x27;ve noticed that my really stubborn dry patches are starting to clear right up. With the use of the rest of their line, I would definitely recommend but due to the dryness, can&#x27;t recommend on it&#x27;s own.  Thanks for the free product BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth it. Comes in great packaging and the product itself is amazing. Get it especially if you really suffer from dandruff and post wash flakes</li>
    <li> Head &amp; Shoulders is known for it&#x27;s reputation for treating dandruff. When my family &amp; friends heard about the new enticing coconut scent and moisturizing formula I received as a free sample from BzzAgent they couldn&#x27;t wait to test it! They reported back to me that within a week not only had their dandruff drastically subsided, but their scalp had felt amazing!! I would recommend Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care to anyone suffering from a dry/itchy scalp!</li>
    <li> I received  this product  from bzzagent.com for review.  Like others head and shoulders  was not really  for curly hair and would leave my hair feeling so brittle dry and damaged? (Stripped). But upon trying this shampoo I noticed the thickness and the smell definitely different from the regular head and shouldersthere was a tiny bit of dryness but nothing to complain about is so awesome it was it is a big improvement from the regular head and shoulders and I think there&#x27;s doing a good job is very creamy I have type 3 curly hair so my hair isn&#x27;t that thick but it can be unruly at times.  But I definitely got a lot of slick I try not to use it everyday because the bottles are not big but I definitely do  like it, is a shampoo that I can&#x27;t handle other than other products.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best dandruff and scalp treatment I ever used. I love the way my hair feels and smell after each shampoo. I love not having to use multiple products to restore the moisture back to my hair.&lt;br /&gt; Head and Shoulders nailed this one</li>
    <li> I received the  Head and Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 hair product for free from BzzAgent. I was thrilled to be one of many to be selected to use and review these products.  So many people think Head and Shoulders products are for individuals who suffer with dandruff or other scalp conditions. I have never suffered with dandruff. However,  I do suffer from dry itchy scalp and dry hair. Is your hair texture thick and a lot of products do not work for your hair? Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if you could go throughout your day or weeks without worrying about your dry itchy scalp? Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if you could go through your day without wondering if someone can see your dandruff? Well, Head and Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 product may be for you. The active ingredient is Pyrithione Zinc which is for fighting Dandruff.  The product was designed for individuals with textured hair. This product will provide moisture, fight against dandruff, relieve irritations and soothe your itchy scalp. If you do not believe me try it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I recieved the product as part of a promotion from Head &amp; Shoulders. I tried for free and in return I write reviews. The Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 works great and is the only line in your brand to eliminate dry scalp and embarrassing flakes for my bi-racial Fiance. I would definitely recommend the Moisture Care line for Head &amp; Shoulders to any ethnic hair and for any person with textured or coarse hair. The feel and smell of the Moisture Care 2-in-1 is very fresh and favorable!</li>
    <li> not reall im pressed but it was a okay product</li>
    <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER!  Perfect for my curls and scalp in ONE Product!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I received a free sample of the head and shoulders moisture care 2 in 1 from Head &amp;shoulders through bzzagent for reviewing and testing purposes. All of my feedback and review are 100% honest and my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used head and shoulders shampoo way back, a couple years ago. I used it once and never again.&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s somehow found it&#x27;s way back into my shower..&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to give it a try. As usual the 2 in 1 moisture care smell amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the effectiveness it got me confused. Is it suppose to make your hair moisturized or greasy? It definitely did not work for me as advertised because I can see the dandruff after washing my hair with it. I also noticed I was shedding more hair with this shampoo than the one I normally use. Again, I won&#x27;t purchase any head and shoulders products for now because I didn&#x27;t have a positive experience with it.</li>
    <li> I recently received this item to try out for free from Bzzagent. This product does it&#x27;s job by getting rid of the flakes on my scalp.  I&#x27;ve always had an issue with dry scalp and having a lot of flakes.  I wear my hair natural for the most part and it gets embarrassing to see the flakes show up in my afro.  Even when my hair is flat ironed the flakes tend to show its ugliness.  After using this shampoo once I see a big improvement on my scalp.  The only drawback is although it is great as shampoo it is lacking on the conditioning part.  This item would be better if it was only used as shampoo.  You need to have a separate condition as it seriously dries out the hair.  Luckily I have a salon brand leave in conditioner that added that moisture back into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the item 3 stars basically because of how bad it dried my hair out.  It smells great and it left my scalp very clean.  If they add a separate conditioner it would definitely be better.</li>
    <li> I received a full size sample thanks to BZZAGENT and HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS!! I didn&#x27;t feel the same tingling I felt with other head and shoulder products I guess because the coconut maybe it was mean to be more soothing. It was, I received a nice lather which is hard for me to achieve on the first wash, normally its the second after I wet shampooed and wet again that it starts to happen I was really impressed on that. It was creamy and didn&#x27;t smell. Not all dandruff shampoos smell great. I did see a big reduction in the amount of dandruff on my scalp. I say the second time I used all the products I noticed a difference. There was layers that was still there after the wash but the scalp smoother took care of that. What I have usually is more like and adults version of craddle cap it seems like. Afterwards I did the co-wash which I really didn&#x27;t understand the terminology with that I thought co-washes were dry shampooing but this one is actually a clarifying conditioner. Another time I decided since it is summer and lets face it who really feels like blow drying? I let it air dry and it didn&#x27;t feel like dry straw! Yes the next day where my new growth is its a bit frizzy but heat is always needed to take care of that.</li>
    <li> Great smelling .Has a sweet smell of coconut (not pungent). Works very well on dandruff. Clears dandruff from first wash. Leaves the hair clean and sweet smelling. Conditioning could be better as textured hair need more nourishment. However if used with the same brands moisturiser it definitely works well.It says it has a pH balance and is gentle on chemically treated hair not sure it is great but definitely is good.Got it free to as a part of promotion from this company to review it.</li>
