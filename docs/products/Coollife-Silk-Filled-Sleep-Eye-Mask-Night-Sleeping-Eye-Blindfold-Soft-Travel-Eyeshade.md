      <li>it&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>Comfortable, easy to use, stores in no space at all.</li>
      <li>Well, it was the best at blocking out the light that I could find and I was hope that the first purchase was a dud and that the second one would work.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I actually like these as the straps are so thin, I don&#x27;t notice them which is a problem with other sleep masks I&#x27;ve used.  The problem is that material is so s***ty it has repeatedly stained my fitted sheet.</li>
    <li> Stays on puts me right to sleep very comfortable</li>
    <li> Work great to block light and help me sleep.</li>
    <li> This product has a definite chemical smell, despite hand washing it with Tide and rinsing in water and baking soda.  Not exactly aromatherapy for sweet dreams.</li>
    <li> Very Comfortable, I use them to sleep during the daytime hours.</li>
    <li> very light and comfortable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a handful of sleep masks and these with the double straps are the only ones that have a good chance of staying on my head through the night.  I sleep both on my back and sides, and sometimes switch positions in the middle of the night.  The ones with single straps, no matter how snug I tighten them, will inevitably slip off at some time during the night.  Given that my main sleep issue with light is in the morning (bedroom window faces east), a mask that is not in place in the early morning doesn&#x27;t help&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is comfortable enough and OK on light spillage.  A few of the single-strap ones I tried were a little better on light spillage but since they couldn&#x27;t stay in place long enough, this one is better overall.  There is a soft piece of cloth to go over the nose.  It is handy these ship in packs of two--that way you have a backup when one is in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straps are thin so I&#x27;ve been a little concerned about breakage, but so far have used them for many months without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested, I&#x27;d recommend ordering in advance as mine shipped from Asia so were slower than normal Amazon shipments, but given the overall price and free shipping I&#x27;m not complaining, it&#x27;s just something you should be aware of.</li>
    <li> These appear to block out the light, but I can&#x27;t get rid of the smell.  I have soaked them and washed them twice, and they still smell.  So far have not even tried to use them because of the odor.</li>
    <li> These guys do just what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  A good, light blocking sleep mask.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the silk. I wanted cotton. And one of the straps broke as soon as I put it on for the first time.  But I cant seem to find facemasks that actually work anywhere. So this will have to do</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a sleep mask, then I suggest you purchase these.  I couldn&#x27;t find a cheaper price.  Everything that I found locally was %1000 mark up from this price, and that was for just one.</li>
    <li> Cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Fast deliver than what the Amazon says.</li>
    <li> cheap but does the trick.</li>
    <li> Cheap and thin but does the job.</li>
    <li> Blocks out light very well. Cheaper on the bay</li>
    <li> This product performs as advertised. I would recommend this product for others.</li>
    <li> Medium sized. Satiny material. Inexpensive and serves the purpose. Black color. 2 elastic non-adjustable straps.</li>
    <li> They fell a part quickly</li>
    <li> Good quality, came quickly. Fun for the bedroom or for a costume.</li>
    <li> Horrible quality and does not block out all of the light.</li>
    <li> These are priced nicely, and work very well for our sleep studies.</li>
    <li> The eye masks work and it&#x27;s nice to get a pair. However, the bands separate quickly. I would recommend these as for travel only to keep in your carry-ons. Not for long term use.</li>
    <li> Worst cover made. Doesn&#x27;t stay on, if it does, blocks off circulation.</li>
    <li> 2 Pcs Outdoor Air Travel Sleep Sleeping Rest Sweet Dreams Comfort Eye Mask.  Very comfortable.  Washable.  No issues.  Very good basic sleeping masks.</li>
    <li> These are the most comfortable sleep mask I have ever worn. Perfect light blocker, light weight, washable, I LOVE them. Send for a pair, just to try, bet you order more.</li>
    <li> I received them really quickly. But they were too tight so they needed to be stretched out for at least 2 weeks before I could wear them comfortably at night. Otherwise very good quality and even though I bought these over 3 months ago they still look brand new.</li>
    <li> All I can say is, GREAT!</li>
    <li> The masks are well made but way too tight, at least, for us.</li>
    <li> Arrived way sooner than expected. These are really nice and comfortable. Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Shipping took MONTHS, but it works as expected.</li>
    <li> Gave one to my husband which he loved but I felt it was covering my nose too much where I felt that I couldn&#x27;t breath with it on.</li>
    <li> For the price these are great sleep masks.  Stretch the elastic a few times for a comfort fit.  Little darker than most inexpensive masks - guess a better padding, but not bulky or overly warm.</li>
    <li> Best features are the two elastic bands that wrap above and below ears.  Most other sleep masks are one strap which pinch one&#x27;s ears and have bulky strap behind head.  All which makes sleeping with one strap mask uncomfortable. UPDATE Aug 2017. After several months use one of the straps broke. Bummer. Fortunately you get 2 when you order. My preferred brand lasted years before the elastic just wore out.</li>
    <li> Keeps the light out well. Soft and comfortable. Great price and quality.  Would purchase this product again.!!  Great for travel or just naps.</li>
    <li> Although I had to let them know they had sent only one, another was soon sent with an apology. They are the light weight and size of the ones given by airlines on overseas trips. Which is what I had lost and wanted to replace. Thanks!</li>
    <li> For the 3 or 4 bucks I paid for it, it does the job pretty well. Soft on the eyes but blocks out most all lights. Plus they come in a pair, so I have a spare for travel.</li>
    <li> Wonderful , I use it everyday, to block out the extral light that&#x27;s around the room my room. Shipping takes almost a month, but free and I pay for this product t less then 2$ for two.</li>
    <li> Works at least as well as masks ten times the price. Comfortable, easy to use, stores in no space at all. Don&#x27;t pay more!</li>
    <li> I work overnights, so I sleep during the day. I have been doing it since 2004. This eye mask blocks out all the light very well, is easy to get used to and quite comfortable. For me, no sedative in the world is good enough to put me to sleep when there is even alittle sunlight in the room. This product is a life saver.</li>
    <li> My Mom loves a light weight sleep mask for taking her afternoon naps.  These two inexpensive sleep masks are perfect and she has one for her bedroom and one for the sofa in the living room, so she has one handy in both places for her naps.  (She is 95 and naps daily.)  The price makes these one of the best bargains we found in sleep masks.</li>
    <li> A little bit different than I expected but for the price tag it carries it&#x27;s a really good product. Cheers</li>
    <li> I think they are nice and cheap, a little tight but fine. I am trying  this item to sleep at home every night.</li>
    <li> While you can&#x27;t beat the price, these are made of such thin material that light filters through, and the polyester is not very soft against the face.  They&#x27;re also on the small side for sleep masks (both the mask itself is small, and the straps on the tight side; I almost wonder if I was sent a child version by mistake?)</li>
    <li> Comfortable and nice, but hurt my ears a little after a while.</li>
    <li> i wanted straps that go over the ears, not around the head. this shows it both ways. sadly it does not go over the ears. still an ok value. i prefer the really good masks with the eye cups formed into the foam, but those all have uncomfortable head straps with big bulky poky velcro around the head. seems odd there is no really good mask out there. anyway, these are the super cheap version but they work even if they do touch your eye lashes.</li>
    <li> this is the first mask I have purchased so I have nothing to compare to.  it is comfortable to wear and does keep out the light now that day light savings time is here and I do not have room darkening shades/drapes.</li>
    <li> Seems to help prevent headaches</li>
    <li> I have a big head, and the elastic straps are too tight.  They wedge the mask into my eyes.  I bought 2 from another vendor 6 months earlier that fit much better, but the elastic wore out quickly.</li>
    <li> One by my beside, and one in my backpack. Now I can sleep everywhere whenever I want, the ultimate college student.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very big head (very difficult for me to find hats and fit helmets). This fits great and the strip hasn&#x27;t broken or weakened at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really hoping they last!</li>
    <li> I am really sensitive to light and started using an Eye Mask when I lived outside of a Street Security Light that shined inside my room.  Now I can take naps during the day, and the lights that shine on the clocks, A/C, and all over the place inside and outside the house will not keep me awake.  I recommend it.  It is very comfortable to wear also.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, cheap, functional.  Not sure what else I would be looking for in a budget-priced sleep mask, but so far this seems to be doing the job well.</li>
    <li> As I said, cheap and comfortable, 100% made in china, but for the price, who cares, I would recommend to any one that want to save money...</li>
    <li> If I had remembered at the time that this was two pieces, I would&#x27;ve emailed them right away. The one I did receive is very nice though and the product overall is good.</li>
    <li> These masks are kind of small and pretty thin, and although I like the extra little piece that covers the nose, they don&#x27;t adequately block out the light. I&#x27;ve even tried wearing both at once and that didn&#x27;t help much, either.</li>
    <li> Definitely helps block out the light without being too tight. I have had them for over two weeks and it hasnt broken or torn. I would definitely buy more of these.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I started a 3rd shift job, and they are very useful to me. They took a while to get shipped to me, but they came exactly as described. I would like them to be a little tighter, they do feel a bit lose. Minor criticisms aside, definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I would rate higher but I am still waiting on them to arrive. I would be more open minded on the time it&#x27;s taking to get to me if they would have logged it with the shipping company&#x27;s. Then I could see where the package was and be able to track it better. Now I am left in the dark wondering when or if this package is even going to get to me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good, I liked</li>
    <li> They work very well for about a week, then the elastic wears down.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers complain hoe cheap or can see a little light thru fabric.&lt;br /&gt;Yes these are cheap what do expect for the price. But I also bought a&lt;br /&gt;more expensive mask and did not really like it. These are cheap but when I need&lt;br /&gt;sleep after working all night these performed well. Not great.&lt;br /&gt;I can see a little light but not enough to make a difference plus the&lt;br /&gt;double straps keep it securely on while tossing and turning.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I cannot complain.</li>
    <li> One notch above the airline biz class freebies; decent double-band of elastic.  Blocks around 98% of light.  Not as sturdy/high-quality as the more expensive versions, but you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;d prefer to buy 10 of these and just throw them away as they deteriorate than bother washing/maintaining the $10 versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery for us took only 1 week from day ordered (US East Coast).</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and you get two! I keep one in a travel bag and one by my bed.</li>
    <li> arrived earlier than expected and its a good product</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It&#x27;s hard to say if these are any good. Why? To save money the Seller (from China, I should have known better) rolled both of them up together into a little tiny plastic bag, the kind one would use for small screws, or single jewelry gems. They are so wrinkled and smushed, I doubt I&#x27;ll ever get them straight.  Coming from China, I should have known better. But they were so cheap, I figured I give them a shot.  it&#x27;s not worth even contacting the seller about them.</li>
    <li> Peaceful sleep nice and comfortable good buy.</li>
    <li> So comfortable and the material is of quality!</li>
    <li> It said it came with two pieces but it only came with one. Very disappointed, it is quite thin too</li>
    <li> Blocks out all light.  Double straps keeps mask in place comfortably. Very little pressure on eyes, nose or from the straps.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and cheap.</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong for the price.  I have been using these for a couple of months now when I go to sleep before the sun sets, and while they do not block every speck of light, they block out enough that I can fall to sleep with no problems.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s alright. i&#x27;m going to buy a less cheap one in the future.</li>
    <li> excellent price had to wait several weeks for shipping but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Even though they are &#x27;inexpensive&#x27;, they do block the light very well and the material is comfortable (silky) - can still open eyes under them without hitting the shade. The small size makes it very convenient for travel.  I have not noticed any odor mentioned by others.  My only negative is the small elastic bands which stretch out very quickly and there is no adjustment.  I have already had to tie knots in them to keep them on my head and that is after only a couple weeks (I have what would be considered a small woman&#x27;s head).  Overall, for the price I will probably be ordering more.  These are the first eye masks I have tried, so have nothing to compare them to, but they do the job for me.</li>
    <li> There is a gap at the top let&#x27;s light in. You get what you pay for! They smelled like chemicals, too.</li>
    <li> Fit very well, block incredibly amounts of light while my wife sleeps. For the price and comfort, I couldn&#x27;t find anything better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars because they&#x27;re the best eye masks around. I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because all I wanted was something simple and CHEAP for when I&#x27;m on the go (or a quick cover in the morning when I want to sleep later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for me, it&#x27;s more about napping than sleeping -- and these work perfectly given the price. I also like that there&#x27;s two straps. I put one over my ear and the other under my ear and that seems to keep this in place well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it comes with two, I keep one by my bedside and another in my laptop bag when I travel along with my spare set of ear plugs.</li>
    <li> good quality and does the job. they wear out in a few months, but they are cheap enough that you&#x27;d just buy another pair.</li>
    <li> These are soft, comfortable, effective and cheap. However, the elastic bands weaken with use. Simply tie a knot in them to make them stronger. It would be wise to buy more than one at a time to have replacements on hand.</li>
    <li> Blocks light and does just what it is supposed to do for much lower price than you can buy in the store.  I ordered enough to keep in various places as I&#x27;m always traveling and like to have it handy if needed.</li>
    <li> They fit comfortably and don&#x27;t fall off in the middle of the night. The material could be thicker, but for what you pay you can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a side and stomach sleeper, so eye masks don&#x27;t always work for me. These are great. They stay in place and aren&#x27;t bulky. If you wear them correctly they block out all light.    These did have an odor so I didn&#x27;t wear one for 2 days after I opened it. I would recommend waiting about 5 days after opening, for the first few days of wearing these there was still a faint odor and I&#x27;m not sure if whatever that odor is is good to have right up on your eyes like that, even if they&#x27;re closed. Plus your eyes sometimes open slightly during R.E.M. sleep.</li>
    <li> Ok.. they dont stay on when you sleep.</li>
    <li> I ordered them without paying attention.  I discovered that the straps are not adjustable.  For sleeping, comfortable fit is essential and the strap length must be adjustable to accommodate different head sizes.  Too cheap to bother to return.</li>
    <li> Love love I love how the bottom has extra support to keep out the light and for the price I got two it was a win for me.sometimes my kids wake up and want to watch TV in my room so this allows me to sleep with the lights and TV on</li>
    <li> arrived to late, but nice, ordered to late.</li>
    <li> These eye masks worked out better than I expected.  I normally buy a brand of eye mask that is slightly bigger and a little more expensive. I decided to pick these up so that I could always have an eye mask in my travel bag.  I stowed one away in my travel case and decided to use one for my normal sleep routine, and was delighted to find that they worked better than the more well-known, expensive brand.    The snug fit ensures that the mask stays firmly on my face.  When using this, I wake up to blessed darkness, and not to the sun shining in my eyes with the eye mask lost somewhere amidst the mighty pillow fortress that I build every night as part of my sleep routine (don&#x27;t judge me).    I initially thought the elastic strap would be very uncomfortable, since it was is thin, but it&#x27;s not.  It feels fine, and the elastic seems to be of a far better quality than that of the other sleep masks I own.  I buy sleep masks frequently, in large part because the elastic straps on the mask wear down very quickly (I must an unusually large head).  the elastic in these, however, are holding up like a champ.</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to.  Makes it dark when you need it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mask twice. The reasons are that, at first I loved it. The mask fit well and blocked out almost all the light. But after four or five wearings, the elastic straps became stretched and the mask would no longer stay on. So why did I buy it a second time? Well, it was the best at blocking out the light that I could find and I was hope that the first purchase was a dud and that the second one would work. I was wrong!  Again, after a few wearings, the elastic straps became stretched again and the mask would no longer stay on.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and a bit smelly; ended up in the trash bin (didn&#x27;t even want to give them away).</li>
    <li> Very cheap, but you get what you pay for.  The light shines through and it didn&#x27;t cover my whole field of vision.  I didn&#x27;t find them useful.</li>
    <li> This travel sleeping mask is very good, it does what it claims to do. Soft &amp; comfortable to wear. Good price.</li>
    <li> nice product. works as said.</li>
    <li> These items literally did not work at all. They snapped the first night wearing, and the quality was very low. Worse than a free item you may get on an airline... DO NOT BUY THIS, it will waste your TIME.. Spend a couple extra bucks and check out some of the other options.</li>
    <li> No light gets in which is wonderful. Only thing though is when I first started using it, the band was pretty tight around my head (and my head is kind of small so) and it gave me a headache but once you get you used to it it&#x27;s fine and I love these.</li>
    <li> Good quality, plus its pretty light so you could barely feel it on. It also got here very fast.</li>
    <li> This product shouldn&#x27;t exist in my opinion. They are too cheaply made and very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Perfect for pin the tale on the donkey,  or any other kid game that requires blinders.  Great buy, good price, fast ship.</li>
    <li> very cheap..you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Is advertised as 2 Pcs. but I only got one.  Are the 2 Pcs. the straps or???  All I know is the picture shows two masks.  I know they are inexpensive but if your going to show two, I expect two.</li>
    <li> great deal...lightweight and comfy.</li>
    <li> The order was ust what I thought I was getting.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable.  I have purchased more expensive ones that are much less comfortable and functional. I find having 2 bands to hold it in place is essential. The ones with a single strap can press more on the eyes and are irritating to my ears (going right over them) ...and if placed above or below the ear they don&#x27;t fit right, let in light and slide off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers mentioned a smell. Maybe my noise is not as sensitive but I didn&#x27;t think it was that strong. And ran it through the washing machine a few times before using anyway... which took care of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things that kept me from giving them 5 stars is that they do let in a little light around my nose.  But unless the room is very bright a rarely notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price ($1.58 for 2) it is a bargain.</li>
    <li> I like the nose cover, it really does help keep the light from seeping in underneath, being that these are kinda silky- they move around a little during the night.</li>
    <li> Material is a bit too synthetic to be comfortable. Wish it were pure cloth.</li>
    <li> These are great! Light weight (you hardly feel they are on, but they completely block out the light), silky, inexpensive, no huge band around your head. Perfect for what I wanted.</li>
    <li> These are just perfect!! They are very well-made and they do the job right :D&lt;br /&gt;Came much earlier than expected as well! 5iVE STARS :D</li>
    <li> Be patient, they come from China. Very good mask for my needs. Elastic seems to be durable after two weeks of use. Better than the ones I got at the hospital!</li>
    <li> Came quickly and they are exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> They work great and all, but they are not as comfortable as the description said.</li>
    <li> Came on time just as describe</li>
    <li> Got a new ceiling fan that dried out my eyes.  I ordered these and I love them.  Not too tight plus they block out all the light and protect my eyes.  This is a winner.</li>
    <li> Just what we expected. My daughter likes complete darkness when she sleeps and she shares a room with her sister. So these work great.</li>
    <li> Havent broke yet... Comfy. Waited 4 weeks to get them... but worth the wait!</li>
    <li> work well for me as I get too much morning light.</li>
    <li> Eye mask works great and does not cause sweating around eyes! I would recommend these eye masks and would  reorder.</li>
    <li> These are basic eye masks, will get the job done. I gave them only three stars because they have a VERY strong chemical odor when removed from the packaging. But after a few days of airing they are okay.</li>
    <li> I wanted something cheap, durable, comfortable, and easy to use that would keep the light out of my eyes during midday naps.  These things get the job done perfectly.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size for my face, effectively blocking ambient room light.  Really like them.</li>
    <li> spend the money on a better one</li>
    <li> These sleep masks looked well made with internal padding.  However, they arrived with a strong chemical smell.  I washed them, soaked them, let them air-out for months..., nothing would get rid of the chemical smell.  I threw them out this morning.</li>
    <li> Good but the elastic don&#x27;t last very much</li>
    <li> Helps to fall asleep.</li>
    <li> these things broke as they were coming out of the container!  the straps on them are sewn on with make 1 throw of a stitch.  just save your money and make a set out of left over scrap fabric you have around your house!</li>
    <li> I bought 3 pairs after reading lots of good reviews but after staining my bed sheet and pillow covers, I will threw them away.</li>
    <li> Took a while to arrive, feels kind of awkward to use over the face (the mask portion itself), and the straps on the ears are alright. You get what you pay for. Also, the airline ended up giving us some, heh...</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for. They work good but the elastic band lose tightness fast.</li>
    <li> What a low price for a great product.  Light weight, comfortable and blocks all of the light.  I was so happy I ordered more.</li>
    <li> Since I have insomnia and headaches quite often, I use them for sleeping in daytime or for when I have one of those headaches that I can&#x27;t stand any light.</li>
    <li> ARRIVED GOOD TIME,+nice,  very comfortable to feel,fits well, would buy it again.+will.  Satin ones won&#x27;t bend around eyes, to stiff 4 me.</li>
    <li> all good, new equipment on hand, excellent packaging, delivery in record time</li>
    <li> cheap but works OK for the cheap price.  Is thin so does not block all light.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a game at a party and they worked out great. Although I don&#x27;t think I would use this to block out light while sleeping since a fair amount of light still seeps in.</li>
    <li> Is what was expected for the price.  It is effective but a bit snug for my 7.5 inch headband.  A bit of stretching and pulling should modify it after a few uses.</li>
    <li> The elastic stretches out and it doesn&#x27;t fit. Before that happens these work well.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and non-irritating eye mask.  Perfect for a great night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs. Keep one next the my bed and one in the car. I haven&#x27;t had any discomfort.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE, WORKS GREAT EVEN UNDER A VERY BRIGHT SUN LIGHT THAT SLEEPING REST BLOCKS ABOUT 98% SO i CAN GET SOME SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME.</li>
    <li> Great Masks for keeping the light out........for the price and two of them , it was great.....I give them a five</li>
    <li> These are simple and inexpensive, but they are our favorites.  We tried buying the expensive ones, but they were too thick and did not cover the area around the nose.  Light will seep in if there is a cut out for the nose.  Plus, if the mask is thick, it is uncomfortable to lay on if you sleep on your side or stomach, as well as too hot.  This one keeps the light out completely  and has a very thin, unobtrusive band to hold it on your head.  It is sheer enough to not be a bother to wear, yet keeps ALL the light out.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. Use it every morning to keep the sun out of my bedroom.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my kids. Good product even though the price was cheap. It did take a while to arrive though.</li>
    <li> Although, i do like this product having to wait a month &amp; some days I&#x27;d finally received them. On the other hand i have to say they are very comfortable and keep the light out as it should.</li>
    <li> They only sent 1 set, and it took forever to get to my house. Just go buy one of these at walmart</li>
    <li> Items came in NEW condition, and were received as advertised. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years, I have one pair that is too big for me but the other one is perfect I use it all the time. Highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> These really block out the light.  Very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> Sleeping during the day with a rag over one&#x27;s eyes doesn&#x27;t do much if you toss and turn. I used it for a few weeks now and it does keep the light out. This product contours and comfort to something I didn&#x27;t expect only because it is cheap. On top of that, I received it two weeks prior to the estimated shipping time! I am loving it! I highly recommend this product to anyone who sleeps during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bon Rith</li>
    <li> Good value.  Comfortable. Shipping took forever.</li>
    <li> Drop shipped from China, this will take several weeks to get to you. Otherwise not bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving them. Thank you</li>
    <li> It is made of a non-cotton fabric and is very hot and nonabsorbent. It also took more than a month to receive</li>
    <li> I like to use this on the plane since I travel a lot these come in handy all of the time.</li>
    <li> Works great! I sleep under a window, so about 6-7 am the sun wakes me up, but these solved that problem. I got a few laughs from parents, but they still work.</li>
    <li> Items were as described.</li>
    <li> Yeah. Two of these things for super cheap.  I moved into an apartment that has a ton of windows.  Every morning I would wake up around 4 or 5 because of the stupid sunshine.  Ok, I love the sunshine but when I start work four hours from the time the stupid sun would start to wake me up...dammit!  Anyway, I was expecting recycled cardboard wrapped with dollarstore fabric, but that is not the case here.  These are actually pretty comfortable. Well worth the purchase. I am going to upgrade after I lose both of these someday for sure...but since I picked these up, I have been sleeping so much better.</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> Took a while to show up, actually almost forgot about them. They are pretty good for the price. Doesn&#x27;t block out all light, as I can still see the light from a lamp and TV but does the job nonetheless and also comfortable.</li>
