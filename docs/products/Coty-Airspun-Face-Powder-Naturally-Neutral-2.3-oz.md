    <li> Have used this powder for years</li>
    <li> I have used Coty&#x27;s Air Spun powder for many years  It is my favorite face powder.  I am so glad that it is available online because the stores sell out of it, especially the suntan an color I use.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to buy this powder at our stores around here for some time. I have used it for years! My grandmother used it before me. I was so happy to get this product on such a timely matter. Great service and good prices. Thanks again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Mrs. Dressel</li>
    <li> Works well and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> product arrive as indicated on order.....great services</li>
    <li> Excellent turnaround in getting the product and the product was just as I expected. I have no hesitation using them again.</li>
    <li> I noticed that the color of the loose powder was not as dark as the color (by the same maker)that it was when I used to purchase it from a Walgreens.  The name was the same (Suntan), but this product was a lighter shade.  It did not work for me and I did not send it back because I had already opened it.&lt;br /&gt;Judy R.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years!! Glad I could find it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother-in-law who was supremely satisfied. She is 88 and has used it all her life.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I already had a very light powder tint, but with summer&#x27;s arrival, I needed a darker one.  Suntan is too dark, but I am combining my light and my suntan to get the color which I am.  All arrived in excellent condition and quickly.  Thank you for making my face more closely match the rest of me.</li>
    <li> I had powder, and the number I ordered was the same number but lighter&lt;br /&gt;color when I used it and saw it.  I don&#x27;t understand and wish it had been&lt;br /&gt;as dark as the powder I had before with the same number.</li>
    <li> the powder that I received was not the correct color the sticker on the container said suntan but it was a really pale like transparent color so not at all what I needed....cost $ to mail back...</li>
    <li> I SPECIFICALLY ORDERED THE COTY AIRSPUN &amp;#34;SUNTAN&amp;#34; POWDER .... I RECEIVED&lt;br /&gt;THE &amp;#34;PEACH&amp;#34; SHADE ..... THEN YOU WOULD NOT &amp;#34;EXCHANGE&amp;#34; FOR THE CORRECT&lt;br /&gt;SHADE AS I ORDERED.  YOU OFFERED A REFUND AND SENT A MAIL LABEL TO&lt;br /&gt;SEND BACK ..... FIRST YOU REFUNDED FOR ONLY ONE OF THE THREE WHICH I&lt;br /&gt;ORDERED .. ALL THREE WERE THE WRONG SHADE.  FINALLY, YOU REFUNDED&lt;br /&gt;FOR THE OTHER TWO.  WHAT A &amp;#34;HASSLE&amp;#34;!!  I AM REORDERING THE PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;ON EBAY .... I WAS AFRAID TO TAKE ANOTHER CHANCE ON YOU.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, THANK YOU FOR, FINALLY, GETTING MY REFUND CORRECT.  AND, I&lt;br /&gt;HAVE RETURNED YOUR PRODUCT .... THANKS .......</li>
    <li> I looked all over and couldn&#x27;t find this Coty Airspun powder in Suntan. I am so glad I found it online for such a good price and the shipping was fast too. I love this product and would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Wife been using it for years claims it saves her $50 a month!  Great covering, get the right shade and shop around!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. I  use a very expensive powder product called bare minerals, it was running low and I just hate paying 27$ for a powder that&#x27;s only 0.27 oz. My Mother and Grandmother used Coty Airspun. It&#x27;s amazing how similar it is to the expensive brand. No turning back for me. The suntan dark peach is perfect. I suggest if unsure of what color buy go one shade darker than you think is correct for you.  The other lighter shade I bought will be used by my daughter. Money saved!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Light and airy. Suntan shade is perfect for my oliva skintone.</li>
    <li> The product was not what I was expecting.  I used to be able to get the product in a darker tone but I am unable to find it now.</li>
    <li> Will not purchase again, it contains parabens! Very sad</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time!  Even in the HUMID South.</li>

    <li> Horrible dark orangey tan color. Can&#x27;t use it. Must be old as it had a fluffy powder puff and the ones I buy today have none.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It blends into the skin perfectly!</li>
    <li> this powder has been around a long time and is still one of the best setting powders on the market.</li>
