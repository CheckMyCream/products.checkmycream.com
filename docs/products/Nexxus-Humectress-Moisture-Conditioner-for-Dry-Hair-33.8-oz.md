      <li>there&#x27;s better stuff out there...</li>
      <li>love the look of my hair after using the products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Basically, you can get more for your money buying these at Costco.</li>
      <li>I HAVE BEEN USING THE SHAMPOO FOR YEARS AND ADDING THE CONDITIONER MAKES IT BETTER.</li>
      <li>I used it twice to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just a one off</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have been better off NOT washing my hair.</li>
      <li>for the hair - it looks healthy, and is easy to manage.</li>
      <li>It is the only shampoo that keeps my hair in good condition and gives it a nice shine.</li>
      <li>I actually enjoy washing my hair again.</li>
      <li>The nice thing is that one doesn&#x27;t need to use much to get the hair to lather.</li>
      <li>lol i am note sure how the other ppl on here wash their hair..</li>
      <li>So I can honestly say that coming from another brand, this NeXXus product is far superb and my hair is now silky soft as a result of daily use.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff so much I had to buy the keg size of it</li>
      <li>The push top bottle is really convenient in the shower and makes filling up my travel bottles easier too.</li>
      <li>Seriously the best at taming frizz and smoothing hair.</li>
      <li>this does not weigh it down nor does it help w/ fly a ways..</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner really silkifies long hair, and leaves in great condtion.</li>
      <li>Seriously, this ultimate moisture type is superb in my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>I am a cancer survivor, and my hair breaks off and falls out much too easily.</li>
      <li>I am an older lady and have thinning and baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t seem to give my hair a deep cleaning or a great final finish.  </li>
      <li>I do love this shampoo/conditioner, howerver the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because of price.  </li>
      <li>Great set - leaves my long, thin hair smelling great, my hair is easy to comb even when wet, the pumps are very convenient in the shower.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best shampoo for my straight, thin hair.  </li>
      <li>I had assumed (my fault) that these were as large as the ones I get from Costco.  </li>
      <li>delivered fast, product leaked</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I have curly hair and my husband has straight hair</li>
      <li>I did not find this brand to be better than my other name brand.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used them for years, and was not disappointed when I finally &amp;#34;got them back&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>so even after a shower and towel dry, I can easily rin a comb or brush through without pullin hair out of my head.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product and supplier.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t make sense that the price for the combo pack is higher than buying them individually....</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo and conditioner combo at my friend&#x27;s house one weekend, but both the shampoo and conditioner I received from here weighed my hair down significantly...</li>
      <li>It appeared to be old and had no lather.</li>
      <li>I have straight blonde hair and now know not to order shampoo and conditioner online.</li>
      <li>I figured only the extra large bottles were like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does not clog, and there have been no other issues with the bottles.</li>
      <li>It barely suds and it won&#x27;t wash out.  </li>
      <li>I have coarse, curly, dry hair and this product has worked really well.</li>

    <li> Great conditioner and shampoo. I will definitely recorder when out.  Although the conditioner changed about 10 years ago, I am still satisfied with the results.  I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner I think since it&#x27;s inception, lol.</li>
    <li> delivered fast, product leaked</li>
    <li> Great set - leaves my long, thin hair smelling great, my hair is easy to comb even when wet, the pumps are very convenient in the shower. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE COMBINATION.  I HAVE BEEN USING THE SHAMPOO FOR YEARS AND ADDING THE CONDITIONER MAKES IT BETTER.</li>
    <li> This is not what I&#x27;d hoped it would be based on all the reviews I read. I used this shampoo and conditioner combo at my friend&#x27;s house one weekend, but both the shampoo and conditioner I received from here weighed my hair down significantly...you could hardly tell my hair had been washed, it was THAT flat almost to the point of oily. I have straight blonde hair and now know not to order shampoo and conditioner online.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what but this is the worst shampoo I have ever used.  It barely suds and it won&#x27;t wash out.  I used it twice to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just a one off but it&#x27;s gross.  I look like I didn&#x27;t wash my hair and there is a gross film on it like I bathed in product.&lt;br /&gt;Never again.  I&#x27;d have been better off NOT washing my hair.</li>
    <li> Dried my hair out very badly.</li>
    <li> My cousin told me to purchase this product and after one use my hair looks extremely healthy. My entire household now uses this product.</li>
    <li> Love it buy when need again</li>
    <li> I have coarse, curly, dry hair and this product has worked really well. I don&#x27;t always use the conditioner but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.  It is pricey but it works for me.</li>
    <li> Great product... and you saved me a trip to the store!</li>
    <li> The shampoo  is the white bottle not the silver one which has a different scent.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo for my straight, thin hair.  It gives my hair bounce, smells good, and leaves a nice shine.  My hair is more manageable after this product, even after using a hair dryer.  If only it weren&#x27;t so expensive!  The nice thing is that one doesn&#x27;t need to use much to get the hair to lather.</li>
    <li> Great products, came promptly.</li>
    <li> favorite salon products, great things to use and leave your hair looking, feeling and smelling great. i love this stuff</li>
    <li> Nexxus is just my family&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt this moisturized before.  My hair feels so healthy.  Great smell too.  Will definately buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizing shampoo and conditioner! Great product !</li>
    <li> Unbelievable!!! I have been on a search for a shampoo and conditioner to save my hair. I have spent hundreds of dollars. Some products were helpful, but nothing was as terrific as these 2 products are. My hair has become dry, breaking off all over my head. I am an older lady and have thinning and baby fine hair. These products are so moisturizing without being oily. Does NOT weigh hair down. Lots of shine! I actually enjoy washing my hair again. I use the leave in spray as well. I can comb through my damp hair now and no tangles!! I will use this &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> love the look of my hair after using the products. I&#x27;ve receive many compliments regarding my hair color and texture (auburn), but I am sure everyone was impressed by the shine and radiance coming from my hair, not the color alone. If I use another shampoo, I get a dry and frizzy look and feel.  Nice smell also. Yes, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s better stuff out there...this was a waste of money. dried my hair out.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner - have used it off and on for many years.</li>
    <li> This product strengthens and moisturizes my hair so even after a shower and towel dry, I can easily rin a comb or brush through without pullin hair out of my head. I am a cancer survivor, and my hair breaks off and falls out much too easily. With Nexxus Therappe and Humectress, I feel as though I am giving my hair and scalp the care it needs. I cannot complain at all. My husband insists we use these products!</li>
    <li> The quality of the product and the smell is why I purchased the Nexxus shampoo and conditioner.  I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now, and the pump feature on the top is very handy.  It does not clog, and there have been no other issues with the bottles. Just great smelling hair!</li>
    <li> I think this is my favorite by Nexxus! The Shampoo is thick and the conditioner leaves your hair soft and smelling like you just stepped out of a salon!</li>
    <li> I did not find this brand to be better than my other name brand.  In fact, I am going back to the other one.  This didn&#x27;t seem to give my hair a deep cleaning or a great final finish.  Just sort of limp and blah.  I&#x27;ll keep trying!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I do love this shampoo/conditioner, howerver the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because of price.  I had assumed (my fault) that these were as large as the ones I get from Costco.  They were actually smaller and I paid the same price.  My fault for not checking, but w/ the pump dispenser I figured only the extra large bottles were like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you can get more for your money buying these at Costco.</li>
    <li> I have used these products for a long time.  The push top bottle is really convenient in the shower and makes filling up my travel bottles easier too.</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t make sense that the price for the combo pack is higher than buying them individually....don&#x27;t buy the combo pack and save yourself $5</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner really silkifies long hair, and leaves in great condtion. So glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them for years, and was not disappointed when I finally &amp;#34;got them back&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;Good for the hair - it looks healthy, and is easy to manage.</li>
    <li> Smells great, cleans great, and lasts a month or more!</li>
    <li> I have been using these Nexxus products for over 25 years. Together they give the perfect blend of volume, hydration, control and softness. I have curly hair and my husband has straight hair: works equally well for both types.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Smells delightful too. It is the only shampoo that keeps my hair in good condition and gives it a nice shine.</li>
    <li> This shampoo keeps my hair from breaking.  Amazon has a good price on it so I recommend getting it there.  It&#x27;s typically $40/bottle in the store.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much I had to buy the keg size of it so I would not run out. The shampoo is like a mini vacation to a tropical resort.</li>
    <li> Like product. On delivery conditioner was frozen solid. Due to fact it was bowed it fell off table and dispenser broke making it a challenge to use.</li>
    <li> No problems, great transaction.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Seriously, this ultimate moisture type is superb in my honest opinion. So I can honestly say that coming from another brand, this NeXXus product is far superb and my hair is now silky soft as a result of daily use. My hair used to be dry and hard to control, but not the case anymore!</li>
    <li> My wife has extremely thick hair. She loves this product and has used it for a long time.</li>
    <li> lol i am note sure how the other ppl on here wash their hair.. but maybe they need to read the directions. I have very fine hair. this does not weigh it down nor does it help w/ fly a ways.. Lather rinse repeat lol very easy.</li>
    <li> Shampoo was delivered with the pump up and had lost part of the shampoo.  It appeared to be old and had no lather.</li>
    <li> Not the same as sold in stores. The conditioner is really different.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best at taming frizz and smoothing hair. My daughter and I both swear by it. We love it</li>
    <li> The best shampoo  and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> Great value &amp; leaves my hair shiny and very smooth. Just a blow dryer and I&#x27;m out the door, no need for smoothing treatments anymore. Would highly recommend this product and supplier. GREAT!!!</li>
