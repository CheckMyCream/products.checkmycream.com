<li> I bought the HSI flat iron a year ago, and decided to get a curling iron.</li>
<li> The reason I do not Give it 5 stars is because I do not recomment it for long hair.</li>
<li> Goes up to 425 degrees, but be careful unless you want to burn yourself like I did.</li>
<li> however I just received mine and it only has one wand in it, so I&#x27;m not sure if I was delivered to correct one.</li>
<li> Curls turn out too tight and gives you a Shirley temple look instead of loose curls.</li>
<li> I curled a few sections of hair</li>
<li> but they are expensive.</li>

    <li> As I read the reviews everyone said it was 4 in 1 wand sets however I just received mine and it only has one wand in it, so I&#x27;m not sure if I was delivered to correct one.</li>
    <li> Good product that gets the job done.  Only wish I had purchased one with a bigger tube.  That was my fault.  I misjudged the size I needed.</li>

    <li> I have been wanting a curling wand for a while but they are expensive. A girl at my work told me about this one. I was reluctant to try it because I bought the 29.99 version with the one barrel. Most curling wands are $100+ and I didn&#x27;t think a cheaper iron would work as well. I tried it today. It came with a glove which I recommend you use because it&#x27;s easy to burn yourself. I curled a few sections of hair and I couldn&#x27;t believe how beautiful the curls turned out. It&#x27;s been 12 hours and my hair is still curled without any hair spray. My hair is naturally straight and it never holds a curl without a ton of hair spray. I love how the wand has a digital display and you can set the temperature. I love this curling iron!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Beautiful curls. The included gloves are very nice.  Temperature setting is tricky until you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Used it once and now it won&#x27;t turn on!!! 20 .00 to send it back to be fixed! I might as well buy another ine!</li>
    <li> I find this curling wand very easy to use. Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> Works great and makes great curls</li>
    <li> Great curling for the price, heats up quickly. Goes up to 425 degrees, but be careful unless you want to burn yourself like I did. Comes with glove to protect your hand</li>
