    <li> I never go anywhere without these. They are great when you&#x27;re in a rush and forget to brush your teeth that day, or if you eat something that leaves you with bad breath.</li>
    <li> Breath doesn&#x27;t feel that fresh. The taste is awful and the brush is way too small. The ends are flimsy and they don&#x27;t work as very good toothpicks (if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re for). Yuck</li>
    <li> My wife loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she&#x27;s happy. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful addition to include in hospitality kits, as well as keep in a purse or computer bag for quick refreshing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of tooth brushes for years. I keep them in the car, that way they are ready for immediate use.</li>
    <li> is exactly as I expected</li>
    <li> Kids love them in their backpacks.</li>
    <li> A bit expensive but great for overnight flights.</li>
    <li> It is quite cute but a little uncomfortable to use everyday.</li>
    <li> Great to carry in your purse and for grand kids.</li>
    <li> I love these things! I put them in my purse and in my backpack so I always have one. I use them after lunch quickly before my next class, they make me feel more rejuvenated too. The mint has a nice little kick as soon as you start brushing which I really like.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these when you are out someplace and need to have your teeth and mouth feel refreshed.  They are wonderful.  Wouldn&#x27;t leave home without them.</li>
    <li> Each year I put together small welcome packets for visiting families for our minor league sports team.  These are essential; does an entire family EVER arrive anywhere with all toothbrushes?  At one time, these were easy to find but no more.  Also everything arrived almost instantly which saved me from disaster because I had expected to walk into a box store and buy them at the last minute.  Oops! Thank you Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I put together local information (free from the chambers of commerce) and 1 or 2 of the things I am most likely to forget when traveling; Tylenol, Kleenex packets, razors, Wisp toothbrushes, bandaids, lens cleaning wipes, hand sanitizing wipes, rubber bands, safety pins, Shout spot wipes, a pen and a notepad.  Very low cost and seem to be much appreciated.</li>
    <li> Love to have these little guys in the car, in the purse...etc.  So handy and helpful.  Can&#x27;t live without them anymore.  For the entire family!</li>
    <li> They are great!  I like having something to freshen my teeth after a meal when not at home.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, I carry them in my car and in my purse.  I also keep them at work in my desk drawer.  They work great to clean my teeth after I eat snacks or meals.  I would highly recommended these brushes to everyone.  They are durable and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;The pick attached gets into the deep areas of all my teeth.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery great product</li>
    <li> These are fabulous for travel, especially after a red eye flight.  It gets enough scum off your teeth and freshens your breath so you don&#x27;t knock anyone over.</li>
    <li> These are amazing for carry-on bags, purses and to keep at the office. Definitely recommend them - and from Amazon in bulk, you definitely save money.</li>
    <li> Just traveled to Manila and back.  These were great for the plane rides and for freshening up in the airport.  We also used them in the hotel and hostel because we couldn&#x27;t drink/use the water.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Got the wisp for some military friends in places where they are the best. Rave reviews from the troops!!!!</li>
