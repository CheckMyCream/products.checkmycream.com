      <li>Great store.  </li>
      <li>one happy customer</li>
      <li>This is a great oil by Edens Garden.</li>
      <li>Great unisex scent.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still pleasant.</li>
      <li>Loved it.</li>
      <li>Good for what purpose I ordered it for</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>I was imagining a very wonderful and unique scent perhaps.</li>
      <li>I received the package and was very pleased.</li>
      <li>Amazing oil.  </li>
      <li>a friend gave this to me after I told her how much I liked spikenard.</li>
      <li>I had smelled this scent at a friend&#x27;s and really liked it.</li>
      <li>Great product, great price, fast ship time. &#x3D;</li>
      <li>Spikenard is a warm and musky oil.</li>
      <li>I have many of Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s essential oils and have been very happy with my purchases.</li>
      <li>I planned on ordering more soon.</li>
      <li>I USE IT FOR MANY OF REASONS FOR MY HOME AND FOR MY HEALTH</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s potent.</li>
      <li>The oil really smells great.</li>
      <li>I purchased it because of the reported beneficial effects, but i don&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is fantastic in an oil diffuser!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad you carry it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>contexts(my favorite being an air freshening spray mix with sweet orange).  </li>
      <li>Great quality nice in diffuser with other oils.  </li>
      <li>Scent is rich and strong.</li>
      <li>It certainly is a strong smelling, not entirely unpleasant, perfume.</li>
      <li>It is so special to have some of the oil that Jesus&#x27; feet were washed in.  </li>
      <li>smell is definitely unusual, but it is not bad or off or rancid, it is just a strong, earthy and herbal smell, not for those who look for flowery sweet</li>
      <li>THANKS!!</li>
      <li>I originally purchased the oil out of mainly curiosity - it is an ancient oil/scent, found in the Old and New Testament of the Bible - but quickly began using it in more and more</li>
      <li>fresh</li>
      <li>smells nice mixed with sandlewood</li>
      <li>/&gt;cherished fragrances worth a years wages in the Bible.</li>
      <li>At any rate, the quality is excellent as usual - Eden&#x27;s Garden oils have always been exactly what we&#x27;ve expected - often even better...</li>
      <li>Family and friends exposed to the aroma tend to find it slightly familiar - from &#x27;a long time ago&#x27; - I&#x27;ve heard this more than once.</li>
      <li>I am accustomed to using things like nag champa or patchouli, kind of a more, excuse the expression, &#x27;older hippy&#x27; scent, which I more or less</li>
      <li>It smells pure and powerful.</li>
      <li>Love the essential product.</li>
      <li>My first impression: since this is the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; from the bible that was poured on Jesus, I was expecting a stronger fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I have three bottles of it and will definitely order more.  </li>
      <li>Their oils are fresh and very therapeutic.</li>
      <li>Pure 100% shipped on time.  </li>
      <li>and I will certainly recommend the brand to&lt;br /&gt;whoever</li>
      <li>Spikenard - with truly deep, earthy tones - is an amazing addition to one&#x27;s repertoire of essential oils.  </li>
      <li>Yep, this is the real thing.</li>
      <li>This is either for someone who absolutely loves this particular scent already.</li>
      <li>For me there was absolutely no subtle &#x27;trying it out&#x27; and getting used to it on any level.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, we did not find it to be a pleasant fragrance for modern day use!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this little piece of history.</li>
      <li>I love all Edens Garden products this bottle should last a long time.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get the initial POTENCY of the quick smell out of my nose fast enough.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine that this is the same oil that they cherished so much.</li>
      <li>Meaning like the woman or man who is obviously wearing wayyy to much of their desired scent.</li>
      <li>I used olive oil as a base oil for the spikenard-after 5 weeks, I checked and the fragrance was very much enhanced-an earthy, yet soft, pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re own &#x27;nose&#x27; check before buying blindly like me.</li>
      <li>Edens Garden are less expensive and their website contains great info for the multiple uses of their essential oils and product arrived well packaged.</li>

<li> It is quite a strong smelling oil, so not ideal for mixing either.</li>

<li> The scent is slightly off from the last oil I had</li>
<li> I expected something that smelled heavenly since the bible says Mary washed the feet of Jesus with her tears and poured from the alabaster bottle some spikenard...</li>
<li> Exactly as expected.</li>
<li> We were curious to experience the fragrance of  &amp;#34;nard&amp;#34; that is mentioned in Biblical scriptures as filling the house with the fragrant perfume.  </li>
<li> The quality of the oil was exactly as I expected it to be.  </li>
<li> It was a harsh, medicinal, woodsy type smell that had the after kick of like some laquer you might find out in your garage.</li>
<li> Not sure what happened.</li>
<li> Unfortunately there was a mix up with the post office, and I initially did not receive my product.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t speak with certainty on whether or not most who maybe seek this scent out do so because the read about this fragrance in the bible.</li>
<li> Smell nasty at first, but it grows on ya&#x27;.</li>
<li> It really smells awful!</li>
<li> but this stuff was terribly stinky, not pleasant at all, not even mixed.</li>
<li> This one stinks.  </li>
<li> but I have since thrown it away within 2 days of recieving it because i felt it was so bad</li>
<li> But this oil smells so bad I threw it away.</li>
<li> You either like the smell or hate it.</li>
<li> Earthy,woody pungent base note.</li>
<li> This jar from this company smells horrible!</li>
<li> I saw some of the reviews that mentioned the horrific smell of this Spikenard oil, so I was a bit</li>

    <li> Amazing oil.  Great store.  Fast/safe shipping.  Good price.</li>
    <li> This oil is great!  It is so special to have some of the oil that Jesus&#x27; feet were washed in.  I have three bottles of it and will definitely order more.  I&#x27;m glad you carry it!&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;ladibug340</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to receiving this essential oil after reading about it in the Bible. I can&#x27;t imagine that this is the same oil that they cherished so much. It really smells awful! It&#x27;s repulsive!</li>
    <li> Spikenard - with truly deep, earthy tones - is an amazing addition to one&#x27;s repertoire of essential oils.  I originally purchased the oil out of mainly curiosity - it is an ancient oil/scent, found in the Old and New Testament of the Bible - but quickly began using it in more and more contexts(my favorite being an air freshening spray mix with sweet orange).  Family and friends exposed to the aroma tend to find it slightly familiar - from &#x27;a long time ago&#x27; - I&#x27;ve heard this more than once. At any rate, the quality is excellent as usual - Eden&#x27;s Garden oils have always been exactly what we&#x27;ve expected - often even better... Spikenard was just that, would recommend!</li>
    <li> a friend gave this to me after I told her how much I liked spikenard. This jar from this company smells horrible! I am embarrassed to have her think I like this! What happened?</li>
    <li> You either like the smell or hate it. Great quality nice in diffuser with other oils.  Would by again</li>
    <li> The quality of the oil was exactly as I expected it to be.  I would order again. The gift was well received.</li>
    <li> My first impression: since this is the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; from the bible that was poured on Jesus, I was expecting a stronger fragrance.  I would like to edit my initial review: I used olive oil as a base oil for the spikenard-after 5 weeks, I checked and the fragrance was very much enhanced-an earthy, yet soft, pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I use this oil as anointing oil and I like it. The scent is slightly off from the last oil I had but it&#x27;s still pleasant.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, fast ship time. &#x3D; one happy customer</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak with certainty on whether or not most who maybe seek this scent out do so because the read about this fragrance in the bible. I did. I was imagining a very wonderful and unique scent perhaps. I am accustomed to using things like nag champa or patchouli, kind of a more, excuse the expression, &#x27;older hippy&#x27; scent, which I more or less am.&lt;br /&gt;But when I removed the cap with the excitement to smell this and I couldn&#x27;t get the initial POTENCY of the quick smell out of my nose fast enough. I had a description of what it smelled like to me but I have since thrown it away within 2 days of recieving it because i felt it was so bad I didn&#x27;t even want to keep trying to give it a chance. It was a harsh, medicinal, woodsy type smell that had the after kick of like some laquer you might find out in your garage. That&#x27;s the best I can remember. For me there was absolutely no subtle &#x27;trying it out&#x27; and getting used to it on any level. This is either for someone who absolutely loves this particular scent already. And the strength of the scent didn&#x27;t seem to depend on application... Meaning like the woman or man who is obviously wearing wayyy to much of their desired scent. I would recommend finding a local store to do you&#x27;re own &#x27;nose&#x27; check before buying blindly like me.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. Exactly as expected. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY FRIEND!! THANKS!!</li>
    <li> I recently ordered a bottle of spikenard after reading about this oil in the BIBLE.  Unfortunately there was a mix up with the post office, and I initially did not receive my product. I contacted the seller Edens Garden and they responded immediately and in no time I received my oil. I&#x27;m in love with this little piece of history.</li>
    <li> I give this product a rating of excellent for quality. The bottle sealed when I received. The oil really smells great. It smells pure and powerful.</li>
    <li> Use essential oils as a part of my routine, personal care system. Edens Garden are less expensive and their website contains great info for the multiple uses of their essential oils and product arrived well packaged.</li>
    <li> I expected something that smelled heavenly since the bible says Mary washed the feet of Jesus with her tears and poured from the alabaster bottle some spikenard...but this stuff was terribly stinky, not pleasant at all, not even mixed.</li>
    <li> earthy . smells nice mixed with sandlewood</li>
    <li> This is a great oil by Edens Garden. Like all their oils it came on time and was packaged well. Their oils are fresh and very therapeutic.</li>
    <li> Earthy,woody pungent base note.I purchased this oil to put in an alabaster jar for display for a Christmas event.Spikenard is the oil Mary poured on Jesus&#x27; feet.Great unisex scent.I will try it with lavender.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Pure 100% shipped on time.  Smells great. I planned on ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> Good for what purpose I ordered it for</li>
    <li> I had bought some from another source which was cheaper, but the aroma from this one blew me away.</li>
    <li> Spikenard is a warm and musky oil. I purchased it because of the reported beneficial effects, but i don&#x27;t love the scent. It is quite a strong smelling oil, so not ideal for mixing either.</li>
    <li> THE OIL IS GREAT I USE IT FOR MANY OF REASONS FOR MY HOME AND FOR MY HEALTH AS WELL</li>
    <li> I have many of Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s essential oils and have been very happy with my purchases. The company philosophy is wonderful and shipments come with a booklet describing all the oils which is a nice touch. But this oil smells so bad I threw it away. I had smelled this scent at a friend&#x27;s and really liked it. Not sure what happened. I will still purchase from this company just not this oil.</li>
    <li> I love all Edens Garden products this bottle should last a long time. Scent is rich and strong.</li>
    <li> Yep, this is the real thing. Smell nasty at first, but it grows on ya&#x27;. And it&#x27;s potent. A tiny drop make the backs of my hands tingle.</li>
    <li> I have made some ointments using this essential oils&lt;br /&gt;its fresh and I will certainly recommend the brand to&lt;br /&gt;whoever asks me for a recommendation.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be the oil that the woman poured on Jesus feet.  I have recently smelled another&lt;br /&gt;spikenard oil by another company and it smelled beautiful.  This one stinks.  I doubt it was processed correctly&lt;br /&gt;because I doubt anyone would want to smell a fragrance like this and it was supposed to be one of the most&lt;br /&gt;cherished fragrances worth a years wages in the Bible.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to learn from other people that this is the Alabaster oil that a woman cleansed Jesus feet.</li>
    <li> Love the essential product. I received the package and was very pleased. I do not hesitate others to try this product.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as advertised. I bought it out of curiosity about the Scripture reference (John 12:3). It certainly is a strong smelling, not entirely unpleasant, perfume.</li>
    <li> We were curious to experience the fragrance of  &amp;#34;nard&amp;#34; that is mentioned in Biblical scriptures as filling the house with the fragrant perfume.  Unfortunately, we did not find it to be a pleasant fragrance for modern day use!  Edens Garden, though, delivered the product efficiently and timely.</li>
    <li> I saw some of the reviews that mentioned the horrific smell of this Spikenard oil, so I was a bit concerned.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is definitely unusual, but it is not bad or off or rancid, it is just a strong, earthy and herbal smell, not for those who look for flowery sweet smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fantastic in an oil diffuser!</li>
