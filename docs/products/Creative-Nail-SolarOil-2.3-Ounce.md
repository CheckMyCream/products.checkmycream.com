<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Feels good going on.  Still awaiting obvious sign of improved nails / cuticles.  Nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Good product but pretty runny (like you&#x27;d expect oil to be).  The bottle is ginormous, so I suspect it will last a while.</li>
    <li> Great nail oil. Really improves cuticles as long as I use it regularly. I put a little on at night while I&#x27;m watching TV, since it does take a while to absorb in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got the big bottle. Smells like Jafra&#x27;s almond oil. Good for the skin/cuticles.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome for dry cuticles on fingers and toes. Nice for a quick moisture look when wearing those pretty sandals.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> My wife very much likes her Solar Oil, but wishes it had a little heavier consistency.  However, she plans to purchase it again when her supply runs out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on a article published on the Internet that jojoba oil remedies \\&quot;age related\\&quot; nail cracking and flaking problems. When I started using this product a month ago, my nails top layer kept breaking off or cracking such that they would not grow beyond edge of my finger&#x27;s nail bed. It was very frustrating because my nail edges were rough and would snag on my clothing and make it hard to do tasks that require fine finger movements like peeling the back off an adhesive label. Because of this problem, I needed to carry an emory board with me to keep smoothing the ragged edges.  It has solved my nail problems. I intend to continue using this product on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. Without it my nails split, and the skin around them is dry and prone to hangnails.</li>
    <li> I love the rich feeling and wonderful smell of this product and what it does for my finger nails.  It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I like this oil as it isn&#x27;t too greasy and is absorbed pretty quick.  This leaves my cuticles moisturized and looking supple.</li>
    <li> Arrived half empty. Spilled all over the package.</li>
    <li> Creative Solar Oil is a product that many, if not most beauty and nail salons use to lubricate the nails and cuticles.  Many salons and manicurists  also recommend it for refreshing a manicure that&#x27;s gotten a bit dingy and tired looking: it will help restore the shine of the polish.  Mind you, most salons and manicurists are also happy to sell you this product, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced, in any event, but it is even more reasonably priced if you&#x27;re able to buy it direct.  Good little product, good price: I don&#x27;t see a downside.</li>
    <li> smells great and really moisturizes my cuticles</li>
    <li> Love it as always.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Wonderful to help with dryness.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with the Super Shiney Top Coat and the Sticky Base Coat to help my manicures last longer, look better, and leave my nails healthier afterwards.  I purchased the set right after Thanksgiving and used it extensively to do various manicures and polish changes during the holidays, and not only did the manicures hold up better than a typical natural nail manicure, my nails looked great even after taking the polish off completely and just showing my natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other users that if I have this on and do the manicure, it doesn&#x27;t get the full benefits of the Sticky Base Coat and last as long as it does otherwise.  When I am doing a manicure, I do it with clean, dry nails and let it set for a day or so.  Then I carefully rub just a tiny bit of solar oil in the edges of my nail bed every day after that.  When I am letting my nails recover and go without a manicure, I use the enclosed brush and paint it on my nails, then rub it into my whole nail bed and cuticles, usually right before bed so I wont be washing my hands for awhile.  It has made a big difference in the look and health of my natural nails in just a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a children&#x27;s librarian and so I wash my hands a lot between handling books and materials, touching kids and things they have touched (germ city, especially in the winter with everyone sick). I have found some great hand creams but still got a lot of trouble with nail growth and hang nails. I used to be frequently plagued by soreness from hangnails and dry cracking along the cuticles no matter how much hand cream I used - especially in the winter.  Now, my nails are less brittle and grow better, and my hangnails and cracked cuticles have healed up with just under two months use of this oil.  I am very pleased with the results and will continue to use this product and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> The Solaroil is excellent, but the eye dropper in the box was broken and should have been wrapped separately. Fortunately I had an old eye dropper that fit the bottle so that I can use it.</li>
    <li> This product is great and it smells good.  My cuticles had hangnails.  My nails were cracking and splitting, after about a week of using it twice per they were SO much better. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> My cuticles are very dry, from washing my hands a lot, working, and just plain genetics.  I&#x27;ve tried other oils in the past, but they tend to be nothing but mineral oil and fragrances. Very bad stuff to put on your skin, very irritating  The SolarOil contains sweet almond oil, jojoba oil, rice bran oil, and Tocopheryl Acetate. I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how good that sweet almond oil smells!  I use this at least twice a day on my hands, and often more.  (I also use it on my toe cuticles, and it&#x27;s made a world of difference. They finally look like human toes.)  Make sure to also use it after getting out of the shower, manicures, and after applying or removing acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and give two thumbs up.  This is a must for your cuticles.  My cuticles looked horrible and after two weeks of use they look normal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve treated my toe fungus with a prescribed lacquer for over ten years and yet five of the toes continued to show clear evidence of the fungus. Two months ago, my toe nails were seen by a manicurist, and she suggested that I treat my toe fungus with Solar Oil. It was important to be certain that the nails were completely dry before applying the Oil because the fungus loves moisture. I treated my nails two or three times a day for two months with Solar Oil, and there is clear evidence that the fungus is no longer active. An important observation is that my fungus was kept under some control for ten years but was never completely cured. At the present time, it appears that my nails are close to being normal.</li>
    <li> I THINK THIS PRODUCT WILL WORK FINE; HOWEVER, I ALSO ORDERED THE CREATIVE NAIL SOLAR BALM SO AM USING IT FIRST.  DIDN&#x27;T NEED BOTH PRODUCTS.     MARIE .. LONE JACK, MO.</li>
    <li> Solar Oil is the BEST nail oil I have ever used.  I was getting Shellac manicures for only a few months and my nail tech noticed my natural nails were very dry and in bad shape from the Shellac.  She suggested Solar Oil.  I found it at a great value in the 2.3 oz bottle on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially applied the oil every morning and night.  Now I have gone to doing my own manicures again and only apply it at night before bed.  My nails and cuticles are in MUCH better condition now.  I plan to continue using it to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dab one brush full for each hand on the cuticles, massage the oil in and apply hand lotion.  So simple!</li>
    <li> Is effective with or without polish.  I did some research on this product prior to purchase and found good reviews.</li>
    <li> best stuff for keeping cuticles soft and acrylic nails from lifting&lt;br /&gt;great price for solar oil--a lot for much less than nail shop or other boutiques</li>
    <li> This is some legit good stuff</li>
    <li> It works well on dry &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; nails IF you use it daily</li>
    <li> I have bought this product through my nail salon but found on Amazon and with the price cheaper I purchased.  The lid wasn&#x27;t screwd on tight so it leaked quite a bit so any money I saved was lost in the solution that leaked out.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! It&#x27;s fantastic. The only concern I have is that the oil seeps under the nail bed and traps dirt really easily. Otherwise, I&#x27;m very, very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is the same oil used by the majority of nail techs at the end of your manicure. They recommend that you use this everyday around your cuticles and this bottle come both with a brush and eye dropper. The brush is easy to use and I like having the eye dropper to put a bit of nail polish remover in those bottles of nail polish that have gotten too thick. Solar oil keeps nails and skin around them hydrated, especially in this cold winter!</li>
    <li> i love this cuticle oil its the best,  it lasts a long time. keep one at work and at home</li>
    <li> Great product really helps with your cuticules</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT for your nails!  Keeps them moist - they don&#x27;t dry out.  Especially good the the older gals.  Been using it for 20 years.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell at all, it&#x27;s kinda disgusting and needs a long time to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Good result though.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it with gelish cuticle oil and the smell became endurable.</li>
    <li> The cap is not so secure, so you have to hold it really well, or else it will spill. The product itself doesn&#x27;t seem to be making much difference, although maybe that&#x27;s because i don&#x27;t use it consistently. I&#x27;ll try to be more diligent and then see if things change.</li>
    <li> Comes in a nice size bottle and has a nice size brush Makes my cuticles smooth after useing uv light</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for 25+ years because it is so easy and it works.. I brush a little on each cuticle (toes as well) and rub in lightly before bedtime. I haven&#x27;t had any excess cuticle since using it and my nails grow fast and tough. Try it. You&#x27;ll see a difference in 10 days or less</li>
    <li> So good for dry nails and cuticles.  I use it whenever I walk by the bottle.  I have dry brittle nails and it helps tremendously.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the price and size of this bottle.  Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this at the drugstore...it&#x27;s much more affordable through Amazon...</li>
    <li> Both my regular manicurists and me can see the difference---fewer hangnails, less dryness, longer lasting manicures.  I usually apply at night before bed and put on gloves in order to spare my sheets from stains and allow for maximum absorption.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for over a year and it has really helped strengthen my nails.  The price for this amount of oil is a great value.</li>
    <li> My cuticles were in horrible condition even with going for manicures every three weeks,within less than a week remarkable improvement. The gellish product pales in comparison.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It&#x27;s amazing. My nails have never been healthier and with a hint if almond is smells delicious.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and always come back to this one.  Slather it on cuticles at night and it works wonders!  It also smells great!</li>
    <li> Good. Not great. But very good.&lt;br /&gt;I keep by TV and paint on when watching, to let it soak in. Have used heavier almond oil, but this one easier to soak in.&lt;br /&gt;And if you use regularly as I do, once a day, my nails are like rocks. That said, I do NOT use nail polish but 1-2 times a year.</li>
    <li> Works well, and  I like the larger size. I could only find smaller bottles at the salon.</li>
    <li> I usually like to have acrylic nails to protect my cuticles (yeah, I&#x27;m strange, I know). However, that can get pretty expensive, since - because I have to keep my nails relatively short - I have to go at least every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally when I don&#x27;t have acrylic nails, my cuticles dry out and shred themselves to a bloody mess - of course, I confess that I don&#x27;t help much with the way I chew on them! However, when I use this oil once a day and massage it in, it REALLY helps me keep my hands from looking like they ought to belong to an axe murderer ;-)</li>
    <li> I like the almond fragrance but the cuticle oil doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the almond scent of SolarOil and I love how well it moisturizes my cuticles. This is always part of my nightly routine.</li>
    <li> I received this order in a very short amount of time and the quality is what I have come to expect for my clients.  The price was excellent for the amount of cuticle oil!!  Well worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it.  It does a great job of keeping the cuticles soft and nails moisturized. It&#x27;s hard to find in retail stores so was delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I apply this solar cuticle oil at least two times a day.  My cuticles are so smooth and beautiful!  A treasure!</li>
    <li> . . .  My nails split in the dry winter air and this was recommended with its combination of ingredients.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; the problem, but it helps.</li>
    <li> Excellent product quick delivery</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice any improvement  in dry hands</li>
    <li> After having acrylic nails and then gel nails, my real nails are in a horrible state.  I read somewhere that keeping your nails free of polish, and applying a good cuticle oil for several months can restore your nails to a healthy condition.  This is a very nice oil with a lovely almond scent.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my nails yet, but then they were never really great to begin with.  I will probably purchase this product again--but this is a large bottle and should last quite a while.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had problems with hangnails and messy, broken cuticles.  I&#x27;m not a hand model and, although I try to keep up with my nails, I&#x27;m usually sporting more of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; rather than the &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; look.  This oil, however, has changed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You brush this oil over your cuticles / nail edges almost like nail polish, but it requires much less.  In fact I usually find myself applying the oil to one hand, and then rubbing the &amp;#34;leftover&amp;#34; oil onto the cuticles on my other hand.  Instead of wiping it off, softly rub it into your cuticles and let it dry.  It doesn&#x27;t take much.  You&#x27;ll be left with a lovely and subtle almond scent and non-oily fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is expensive, but you don&#x27;t have to use much - it&#x27;s VERY easy to use too much.  Just go slow, and you may find that like me, you can use the &amp;#34;runoff&amp;#34; from one hand on the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even in dry Illinois winters, if I use this 1-2 times per week while watching TV my cuticles stay healthy and pain free.  Absolutely 2 healthy thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Great product have used for years</li>
    <li> I have used Solar Oil for years but was unable to find. Came home and ordered on Amazon and got exactly what I was looking for and cheaper than usual.</li>
    <li> i have used it for years and love it.i found it was cheaper on line.it is a great product for cuticles</li>
    <li> I have always had bad nails and they have gone worse lately.  Probably age and living in the dry southwest desert.  The woman who does my nails told me the history of this product and said that it&#x27;s good - gave me a tiny bottle to try - said to use it every day over the cuticles.  She said that she can tell who uses it and who doesn&#x27;t.  Well, I was sloppy about using it so there was no big change.  But when I did start using it every day, I could see that the new growth was pinker and smoother than the old.  So every two weeks when I had my nails done, the healthier nail part was bigger and the unhealthy part was smaller.  So I&#x27;m a convert and bought this rather humungous bottle which will last a long time.  Also, this has a wonderful fresh almond fragrance.  I have tried many other products over the years; only one worked (some kind of product used on horses&#x27; hoofs, (can&#x27;t remember the name) but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made anymore - at least not the item that I was using - as I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.  All the rest were a waste of money and time.  In fact, one product advertised on HLN was so useless that I sent it back and got a refund.  So I was definitely skeptical but I was wrong; it&#x27;s a good product but you have to use it at least once a day.</li>
    <li> As described.  Love the scent!  excellent oil for cuticles.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased w/my Amazon purchases.  The Terra Box Trays were the wrong size for my planters, even though I did measure and I believed they would fit.  I had to return them because they were too small.</li>
    <li> Great protection for manicures and pedicures to prevent dry nails and extending the life of polish.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and recommend daily application.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any significant changes to my nails or cuticles.</li>
    <li> My cuticles have never looked better.</li>
    <li> Okay, so maybe calling it a miracle is a stretch, but this is still an amazing product. I&#x27;ve been using it on my nails for several weeks now, and I can&#x27;t believe the difference.  Not only are they shiny and smooth, but the color is a very healthy pink.  Best of all, they don&#x27;t break!  I&#x27;ve jammed my fingers repeatedly, and my nails have not split -- which is really saying something, considering how brittle they used to be.  Forget nail hardeners and use this instead.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> My nail technician uses this and highly recommended it.  Now my husband is using it too!  Great product, lasts a long time even with two of us.</li>
    <li> I have use this nail oil for years it&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> Absolutely helped after one application. I will highly promote this product. It is well worth the money and will last a very long time</li>
    <li> This oil smells wonderful and feels great. You place a drop on each finger on the cuticle and then rub it in to the cuticle. It has saved my cuticles this winter. They look amazing and hydrated. I have very little to no hangnails or splits in my cuticles. I use it every night at a minimum but sometimes I use it twice a day. It really is great and I recommend it for everyone. I have bought this as a gift for my mom and grandmother. My husband also asks me to rub it into his cuticles. My grandmother tells me that my grandfather does the same. It just feels so nice.</li>
    <li> This solaroil.. is amazing keeps nails and cuticles from drying out and stops ridges.. love the big bottle and not too expensive.. received just fine.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Comes in a large bottle, so it will last forever. I put it on cuticles every morning after shower and every night before bed and my nails have never been healthier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a delightful fragranced product and helps the skin growth under nails, but won&#x27;t cure problem.  But....it really helps nail bed dryness.</li>
    <li> Solar Oil is a must have for the care of your cuticles. The bottle is huge and the smell is like fresh Almonds. It glides on like a polish and then you rub it gently around the rest  of your entire nail bed. Must have for the long winter months❤</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone to Beauty Supply Houses and gotten their own brands of oil but this is by far the best.  I can&#x27;t explain why but you can tell the difference.</li>
    <li> Use liberally everywhere not just nails.  I live in Alaska and get so dry in the winter my knuckles peel and elbows get dry. Love this oil.</li>
    <li> Awesome cuticle oil! Use it daily!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and smells so lovely! I really like this product and think everyone should use it.  It goes on nice and soaks in pretty quick considering. I&#x27;ve been using this for a bit now and really think it helps with nail growth and strength.</li>
    <li> I keep this product on my bedside table, coffee table, and in my car. When my hands or nails feel dry, I rub a little SolarOil on them. It does the trick.</li>
    <li> Brushing Solar Oil on cuticles keeps them moist, prevents cracking, and keeps them looking attractive.  Professional manicurists and pedicurists use it.</li>
    <li> love it! Great price.</li>
    <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorite nail products!</li>
    <li> I use it with my Acrylic and occasional Gel nails... I take meds that dry out my hands and feet which then leads to separation between my natural nail and the coating. With use of this product, I don&#x27;t get hang nails like I used to and in this size bottle, I can more reasonably use it for my toes as well. Once you&#x27;re over 40... (44 next week), you really need great moisturizes to sustain your skin. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Used this item before. Excellent for cuticles.</li>
    <li> The product arrived soon and met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Would give this 10 stars if I could. I bought this product because of the reviews and wow, love this stuff. Sure hope they don&#x27;t stop making it. Now my daughter is in love with this stuff. Will have to get some for her as well.</li>
    <li> Nail tech turned me on to Solar Oil.  I have terrible cuticles, dry and split.  This oil works wonderfully.  Never had such good looking cuticles.  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I have used Solar Oil for years. I used to be able to buy it at a retail store in the Salon. When they closed, I thought that I would never find it again.  I was thrilled when I saw it  on line here. I bought the 2.3 oz. and have had it for at least a year. I poured some into a smaller bottle, in case I accidently spilled it. I keep one bottle  in family room where I can use it while watching TV and another in bathroom to use before going to bed. I was always a nail bitter, until I started using solar oil and with quick results I was amazed at the quick growth and my nails were no longer thin and split. You will not be sorry if you choose the large size bottle and it does last a long time.  I really am pleased with the results and the more times you apply, the quicker results.</li>
    <li> Product fine I have used the solar oil for many years, what was sent to me was CSN solar oil, but I&#x27;m going to try it.,</li>
    <li> My manicurist uses this on me when I get my nails done and so I got some to use on a daily basis between visits.  it keeps my cuticles very nice.</li>
    <li> This oil is AMAZING! Really has helped my raggedy nails and cuticles. I work with the postal service, and working with paper, cardboard and paper products all day is terribly drying to your skin and especially your nails. Mine cracked, split, chipped, peeled, and stayed brittle until I began to use this oil. I have been using it now for 4 years and have also started using it on my toenails and feet. It is absolutely BRILLIANT! Thanks so much for offering this!</li>
    <li> great stuff if you use it 3 to 4 times a day it will really help your nails grow!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product at a spa/manicure salon.  They sold tiny bottles for like $5.  This is a wonderful product, that makes your cuticles soft and moisturized. ( Mine are naturally dry and brittle. )</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Nails grow much stronger and keeps cuticles and skin around nails soft. This product made my brittle nails very hard and strong.</li>
    <li> My cuticles were dry and had rough edges or peeling skin.  I had a bad habit of picking and biting the atea around my fingernails The ragged edges annoyed me but the biting only made it worse. Cuitcle oil plus substitution of cuticle nippers solved the problem.</li>
    <li> After I started using this my Nails started Peeling really bad! and I went from Long nails to sort nails in a week. But Im really not sure why.I have a full bottle and Im not sure if I will try it again just to make sure that this really was the cause of my nail problems or Not!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  Works quite well for dry cuticles, if using consistently every day &amp; inbetween hand washing some.  Much cheaper to order in this larger bottle.  I fill the smaller bottles with this one to have one available at work and in my purse.  This larger bottle has a dropper included.</li>
    <li> like product just don&#x27;t need that big of bottle</li>
    <li> CND solar oil is strange.  It does not really moisturize my cuticles as they are still on the dry side, but they seem to grow back slower and easier to remove.  I shellac toes and nails and use on both.  It is not exactly oily, but, does not completely evaporate as some reviewers say.  Since Shellac is porous I feel it is important to use this product.  It does not stain.  I do recommend this product and I just ordered a 2nd bottle.  I try to use once a day but not always.  Wish it were a little oilier and that way I know it will moisturize better.</li>
    <li> i like this, but not as well as i like (love) Qtica.  So what i am doing is using the Solaroil oil in conjunction with the Qtica, to use it up.  That works well for me.</li>
    <li> I have those fragile nails that are dry, break and peel.  If I use nail polish remover once, the damage is there until it grows out.  I bought this along with a zillion other things to see if it would help. This is the only one that helped.  I use it on my entire nail and cuticle every night.  My nails are nice now.  They are not long and polished, but are nice healthy looking cared for nails. I let them grow out about 1/4&amp;#34;.  I have had people remark about my nice nails.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Comes with brush and dropper. I put it on once a day so that my acrylic nails don&#x27;t dry out and they last longer.</li>
    <li> My nail technician uses solar oil on all of her clients. I really love the smell, and that it soaks in. It also makes my cuticles soft and they look great.</li>
    <li> wonderful product. promotes nail health, strength and growth. Use at night and it really works</li>
    <li> As a manicurist, I use and recommend this product to all my clients.  Really assists in restoring luster and shine to the nail. Many nails become dry and brittle due to age or constant use of nail polish. This product helps.</li>
    <li> I will not buy a large size of this oil again because the large size went rancid within a few months. The small size has not spolied with daily use in many months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and love it for my dry cuticles.  This was priced much less than ni the beauty salons.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. It&#x27;s great. Helps both my cuticles and nails. Can&#x27;t find it locally any more so have to order it.</li>
    <li> Yeah, I know that sounds melodramatic, but if you had perennial dry cuticles prone to cracking, splitting and hang-nails you&#x27;d understand. Also great for cracked heels.  If your nails are a mess, spend a week without polish and massage this in 3-5 times a day.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at how rapidly, and completely, the nails an nail bed heal.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well. Smells great and absorbs fairly quickly. Definitely use after all nail painting is done and cleaned up.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and really like it. The size was perfect and the cost was very good.</li>
    <li> Unsure about this. Goes on nice. Nice light scent but I&#x27;m not seeing any improvement in the condition of my cuticles. Not sure if this is meant to be used throughout the day? I only use it (once) at night when I&#x27;m doing my nails. I do not like the bottle. It does not get a tight enough close for my liking. I can&#x27;t trust that it won&#x27;t open so I can&#x27;t travel with it. I&#x27;m going to try a pen style product instead that I can keep with me in my purse and use throughout the day and see if I have better luck with that.</li>
    <li> This is the very best cuticle oil you will ever use.  I have tried a couple others in a pinch but always come back to the Solar Oil.  I use it on my fingernail &amp; toenail cuticles both.  Any size bottle will last quite a long time, but I get the largest one (2.3 oz.) &amp; fill my mini travel size so I always have it with me.  Excellent at softening your cuticles &amp; the skin around them.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff. I use it everywhere, especially on my heels. It works wonders on the dry skin of heels and elbows. I put it straight on my skin and use lotion to rub it in. It also helps my hangnails, and nails them selves. My nails have never been stronger or more shiny.</li>
    <li> Love this product and hard to find in the stores. Keeps nails hydrated along with cuticles. A must for those of user hat do our own gel nails which can dry out your nails.</li>
    <li> My nails break and peel in the winter.  I have been using this twice a day and my nails and cuticles look great.  I do have a couple of smaller bottles - one tiny on that I carry in my purse.  This bottle came with a dropper so I can fill the smaller ones.  Would not be with out this now.  LOVE it.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product for nail care. Used at the salon I go to, &amp; I use in between manicures at home. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I recently had my nails done in AZ at a spa and the technician told me about this product and the benefits of using it - keeps your nails moisturized, which in turn keeps them strong.  Use with or without polish on your nails.  I recently starting using the gel on my nails and removal can be very harsh.  After removal of the gel I use this a few times a day and my nails and cuticles looks and feel amazing!  This is a must have for everyone!</li>
    <li> I have always had very dry cracked cuticles that get painful during the winter.  I have been using the solar oil for a few days and am in hopes that it will help.</li>
    <li> Solar oil softens and heals cuticles and I intend to keep using it. I really like the larger bottle you sell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this SolarOil for a couple months now and I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. I&#x27;ve still gotten a few hang nails. I&#x27;m going to keep using it though. Nails take a long time to grow, so maybe there&#x27;s still hope. I do like the smell &amp; the brush applicator.</li>
    <li> I have had this before and just bought a bigger bottle. Love it, could make brush bristles longer to fit to bottom of bottle.</li>
    <li> There are some that complain that the oil smells funny but I think it has a nice subtle almond scent.  It&#x27;s not over powering at all. I use this oil a few times a day to keep cuticles moist and aid in the health of my nails. Considering the size, it was a great value in price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this cuticle oil for about 3 weeks now and have noticeable difference in my nails and cuticles. My nails are stronger and cuticles always well taken care of, not dried like they used to.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this brand of cuticle oil!!</li>
    <li> This is basically Almond Oil, which is sold as other names for nutrition applications for gel nails.  Works great on cuticles.</li>
    <li> Not too effective in my experience.</li>
    <li> My nails have always been so weak they could break from picking up a cottonball.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about six months and it is amazing how strong and long my nails have grown.  I just brush it on my nails as I am watching TV at night and massage it in.  I no longer have to get those horrid (and bad for your nails) tips put on at the nail salon.  As a matter of fact, I have saved money by being able to maintain my nails myself.</li>
    <li> Great item. Just like the salon uses.</li>
    <li> I have gel nails and the solar oil really makes a difference. my cuticles and nails are no longer dry. great product and wonderful price at amazon.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, comes in an attractive bottle with both a brush and a dropper. This oil absorbs quickly into the skin. Odorless.</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner for your nails. Ends rough and torn cuticles, promotes healthy nails.  Daily use will end your problems with dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> This oil is very moisturizing and the almond oil in it gives it a lovely smell that dissipates quickly but is nice as you are applying the product. It doesn&#x27;t seem to stain clothing either making it easy to use regularly without much fuss.</li>
    <li> My nails have ridges, some especially troublesome and prone to splitting. Probably caused by a combination of age, injury and swimming in chlorinated pools.  I had tried many brands of hardeners, which seems to help in the short term but actually made my nails more damaged and even yellow in some cases.  The hardeners would peel off taking a layer of nail off.  They basically helped disguise a problem rather than fix it.  I read that often the problem is not softness but dryness, so I decided to switch strategies and started using Solar Oil.  I was pretty amazed that my nails started feeling better right away.  Smoother, whiter tips, ridges starting to look less noticeable.  The key is that you have to reapply often, but the payoff is well worth it.  Solar Oil is just a fairly mundane combination of mostly sweet almond oil and Vitamin E, but it has a pleasant scent and is easy to use.  I am really glad that I discovered that my nail problem is dryness, not hardness, and that I started using this.  It is a &amp;#34;cuticle&amp;#34; oil but really helps the entire nail</li>
    <li> This oil has a nice almond fragrance, not too strong, and absorbs quickly. I keep some upstairs and downstairs so I can quickly apply to my cuticles and nails throughout the day. Also has a nice applicator brush, easy to use and gives good coverage very efficiently.</li>
    <li> Mishap trying to receive it but I finaly have it and I am very happy</li>
    <li> I first bought this product at a spa, and I had to order more.  I love how it softens the skin around the cuticle especially because my hands tend to be dry/chipped during the winter.</li>
    <li> the smaller size bottles are less than a quarter of the quantity of this size but this bottle only cost about twice as much.  Per ounce it is only about one half the cost of other sizes.</li>
    <li> Really love this oil! It comes with a dropper, goes on light, and penetrates fast. My friends like me to do their nails just so I will use this oil on them. You really can&#x27;t go wrong in purchasing Solaroil.</li>
