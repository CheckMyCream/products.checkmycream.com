      <li>better than the ones that came with my blue/red light therapy device.</li>
      <li>The reason I give them 4, not 5, stars is that even with the strap adjusted, they&#x27;re not the most comfortable things in the world.  </li>
      <li>The elastic band snaps off easily.</li>
      <li>and they work just fine at keeping out the light -- much better than the eye shades one gets from airlines, for example, which allow light in from the edges.  </li>

      <li>I purchased this to use with a facial light therapy device, which has a very strong and bright light.</li>
      <li>They block out the light just fine though...</li>
      <li>and if you try to wear them with the band UV light gets in from the sides.</li>
      <li>So I was tanning while holding them to my face as to not expose my eyes to UV light.  </li>
      <li>They work as they&#x27;re supposed to and the elastic band allows you to customize the fit to your head.</li>
      <li>but they are comfortable.</li>
      <li>but i dont feel comfortable wearing them</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t understand why there are not goggles available</li>
      <li>They were comfortable and I like that you can still look through them to see what is around you.</li>
      <li>that are 100% ALL LIGHT</li>
      <li>These do not block out light.</li>
      <li>Cheap</li>
      <li>Comfortable to wear and meet USDA requirements for blocking UVA/UVB rays.</li>
      <li>Cheap and gets the job done</li>
      <li>They manage to dig into my eyes and still let light in.</li>
      <li>I ended up leaving them at my tanning salon, and trading them for the cheap plastic ones they have there.  </li>

      <li>Comfortable,  rubber-like.</li>

      <li>and they are super comfy</li>
      <li>They serve well their purpose, fit right, and for the price, they are really useful.</li>
      <li>No unpleasant surprises.</li>
      <li>These little goggles give a good fit.</li>
      <li>They fit snugly onto my eyes and block out the sun very well.</li>
      <li>worth the price.</li>
      <li>worth the price</li>
      <li>My sunglasses would normally leave large areas on my face that didn&#x27;t tan, but with these they give even more protection</li>
      <li>These goggles really cut down on the painfully bright light and stayed on my head without a problem.</li>
      <li>They get very hot in the sun so a lighter color might be better for tanning outside vs. a tanning bed.</li>
      <li>Light weight, string is comfortable and I can keep my eyes open without having to squint.</li>
      <li>great tanning goggles, they are super flexible and i love the black because it makes it dark</li>
      <li>The black blocks out almost all of the light, and the elastic strap keeps them feeling very secure.</li>
      <li>Come exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>The goggles themselves seems to be pretty sturdy, the cord a bit flimsy, but it does the job.</li>
      <li>They are very durable as well!</li>
      <li>I ended up throwing them away and buying the ones they sell and the tanning salon for the same price, and those work much better.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nothing fancy, but hey, that&#x27;s exactly how I like it.</li>
    <li> works for me, red light therapy lights</li>
    <li> I use these goggles when I lay outside in the hot sun to prevent my eyelids from burning. It prevents my eye area from getting that &amp;#34;owl look&amp;#34; with regular sunglasses. However, on the really hot 100+ temp days, it makes my eyes itch. Might just be me. I sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> Same ones you use at a tanning salon but come with a strap I don&#x27;t use :)</li>
    <li> Love these, work very well, seal around the eyes and keep the light out. I have been using these for a few months and they do not break as quick as the cheap crap the tanning salons around here sell.</li>
    <li> Great product. What you see is what you get.</li>
    <li> These are probably the best tanning bed goggles I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Loop to tie string on was broken, so there was no way to secure the eyewear for tanning. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great fit and comfort!</li>
    <li> Save your eyes from sun damage while still enjoying the sun.  The sun can and will burn your retinas and is much stronger than when we were kids.  Use them if you can.</li>
    <li> COULD NOT FIND ANY IN THE AREA . WAS SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT, AND PRICE AND MOST OF ALL IT SERVED MY PURPOSE.</li>
    <li> A lot better, sturdier and cover more of the eye than what was at my tanning salon. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> just some cheap-o tanner goggles</li>
    <li> Comfortable, flexible, easy to adjust string.  Can&#x27;t see out of them, but it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m trying to read a book while I&#x27;m tanning...I can deal with 10 minutes with no visual stimulation.</li>
    <li> Small, but works just fine.</li>
    <li> They did what they were designed to do</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Keeps my eyes safe while I tan. Prime eligible makes this a no-brainer</li>
    <li> Cheap and I can still see.</li>
    <li> They work great. As advertised.</li>
    <li> I do not tan very much, but these were perfect for my needs, and they fit my face very well!</li>
    <li> I bought these as a replacement for my original Sunnies which have always been hard plastic. These are flexible and much more comfortable than those ever were. I tan in a stand-up bed so the kind of eyewear that stays on with a strap is a must. Highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Dark lenses on these, arrived quickly and without a hassle. The cord for them is super weak however, so you just have to be a little careful with that.</li>
    <li> This just what I needed.  No more sharing the used goggles from the tanning salon.  Who knows if they are ever cleaned. Not my problem anymore.</li>
    <li> Great eye wear! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> A must buy for when you&#x27;re tanning! These are a wonderful price considering these can go for so much more in a tanning salon. They are very durable as well!</li>
    <li> I use my sunnies on my clients when I&#x27;m doing extractions and they need the cover on their eyes from the bright light. Works so much better than cotton balls!!</li>
    <li> just what is needed and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, unable to adjust these cannot recommend them at all. Don&#x27;t waste the money! These do not block out light.</li>
    <li> Just as you would expect. Only down side the black rubber has developed white patches. Not a big deal you can hardly see them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine are defective or not, but these are EXTREMELY stiff and hurt my face - not soft or flexible at all!  They block out the light just fine though...</li>
    <li> They do what they are supposed to do</li>
    <li> These have eye openings so small, it&#x27;s almost impossible to see.  The rough textured plastic over the small eye openings, DOES make it impossible to see.  Ordering different ones now.</li>
    <li> great tanning goggles, they are super flexible and i love the black because it makes it dark and they are super comfy</li>
    <li> What can I say, tanning bed goggles. Get some and use them or burn your eyes out. I have stopped tanning due to the cancer risk and other terrible things you cannot kill with the strongest cleaner. However, this product works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it for tanning bed, but use it while I&#x27;m in the infra red sauna for eye protection to keep my eyes from drying out</li>
    <li> Just like another user, I purchased these for a facial light device (Red, Blue, Yellow - LED.) These are 1000% better than the goggles the company sent me, however... I just don&#x27;t understand why there are not goggles available that are 100% ALL LIGHT protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit, these do cancel out all the blue light and the one&#x27;s sent with my unit did not. When I use red or yellow light, I don&#x27;t know... there may be a difference, I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, from working in the lighting industry (for over 20-years) these lights quickly kill your eyes. In just the recent few times of using the LED PDT light I purchased, I can see the degradation That&#x27;s originally why , in my 20&#x27;s, I went from not needing glasses, to needing glasses, to LASIK. It&#x27;s been around 10-years since my LASIK and time has degraded my eyes, I&#x27;m sure - HOWEVER, since using this facial light fixture my eyes are markedly worse. These Sunnies though, are the best I&#x27;ve found as of yet.</li>
    <li> These goggles seemed quite small, and actually hurt to wear.  They were not big enough to comfortably cover the eye and sat on the eye itself instead of around it.  Would recommend a different brand rather than this...</li>
    <li> no better or worse than the others. I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re going to the tanning place anyways, they have $5 models there that suffice.</li>
    <li> Pretty minimal requirements for a simple, but necessary, item.  Comfortable to wear and meet USDA requirements for blocking UVA/UVB rays.</li>
    <li> Hard to adjust and *really* uncomfortable. They manage to dig into my eyes and still let light in. Fail.</li>
    <li> These did not work at all for me. The band kept coming loose and if you try to wear them with the band UV light gets in from the sides. So I was tanning while holding them to my face as to not expose my eyes to UV light.  I ended up throwing them away and buying the ones they sell and the tanning salon for the same price, and those work much better.</li>
    <li> I can still see.  These must work.</li>
    <li> Great sunnies. From other posters who said they used these outside, I decided to try it out. My sunglasses would normally leave large areas on my face that didn&#x27;t tan, but with these they give even more protection and I get a complete tab on my face. They were comfortable and I like that you can still look through them to see what is around you.</li>
    <li> Great for the price! I use these to tan on my back deck. They fit snugly onto my eyes and block out the sun very well. They get very hot in the sun so a lighter color might be better for tanning outside vs. a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Too small and too tight; they kept pinching the skin around my eyes so I couldn&#x27;t wear them very long...</li>
    <li> They serve well their purpose, fit right, and for the price, they are really useful. I recommend them. Any time</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these, and one of the straps broke, day 1. Other than that, these things do their job. They block the UV rays... It&#x27;s not that difficult.</li>
    <li> I always like to read while tanning. With these glasses, I cannot!  The holes are spaced quite far away, and very dark. It&#x27;s impossible to use my iphone while tanning.  I ended up leaving them at my tanning salon, and trading them for the cheap plastic ones they have there.  Now I can answer emails while tanning once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I should mention is that they appear to be high quality. They look a bit nicer and are more rubbery than the $1 glasses you&#x27;ll find in a salon. Hence two stars and not one.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Great price. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Good tanning goggles and for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Durable, stays on and fits well</li>
    <li> These work for what they are, but don&#x27;t expect them to last long. Definitely not made for durability with the attached string and thin nose bridge piece.</li>
    <li> The goggles work as expected but the elastic doesn&#x27;t fasten well, so sometimes it slips. They need to create a better system of fastening the elastic to the goggles so it doesn&#x27;t come off.</li>
    <li> These have a little more flexibility than the eyewear I&#x27;ve had in the past, and they work great. Mine came with the elastic, which is easy to tie on and fit. An absolute must for tanning, unless you want to mess around with the little foil things that stick to your eyelids.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my facial steam sessions to protect my eyes it works but i dont feel comfortable wearing them but they are good</li>
    <li> My husband and I use these for our afternoon cat naps and they work just fine at keeping out the light -- much better than the eye shades one gets from airlines, for example, which allow light in from the edges.  The strap needs to be adjusted properly to keep the goggles on, without pressing them too tightly against the face.  The reason I give them 4, not 5, stars is that even with the strap adjusted, they&#x27;re not the most comfortable things in the world.  A little felt along the inner edges might do the trick.  Still, they&#x27;re the best napping eye shades we&#x27;ve yet come across.</li>
    <li> They do the job. They aren&#x27;t very comfortable, not unbearably so though. They just feel awkward across the bridge of my nose.</li>
    <li> I really like it thank you</li>
    <li> i currently use these goggles during the extraction process of my facials. would purchase again if needed in the future.</li>
    <li> Come exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> I love having my own glasses so now I don&#x27;t have to remind the workers that the sand up tanning booth needs glasses with a string. I also use these for laying out in the yard instead of sunglasses.</li>
    <li> These glasses worked just fine. The size was a little small for a big face, but they are supposed to be small. They worked as advertised and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good goggles and easy to wear.</li>
    <li> Seems a bit flimsy - I&#x27;m always worried the string will break. But it does the job and was very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything fancy at this price, but these goggles do the trick and have held up well.  Excellent value!</li>
    <li> No unpleasant surprises. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. :) Plus, it&#x27;s black and it makes me look like Riddick. So, that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
    <li> These work well for me. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> works as expected.. draw string constantly gets undone, but aside from that they work well and are very light weight. worth the price. Recommended.</li>
    <li> The goggles were a little small and narrow I&#x27;m a small person but they still almost didn&#x27;t reach all the way across both eyes</li>
    <li> very comfortable without UV</li>
    <li> Well constructed for UVB protection, good coverage. Just a bit difficult for dual-use,i.e  working at the same time while wearing these.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable fit, after affixing the whole elastic cord there is still just enough slack left so it doesn&#x27;t bind.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than the ones that came with my blue/red light therapy device.</li>
    <li> they are not soft flexible like the description but they are comfortable. worth the price</li>
    <li> Comfortable flexible and durable fit; My wife and I both like ours. Strap enables stand up or lying down tanning.</li>
    <li> These goggles dig in a little under my eyes and make dents.  I applied stick on lambs wool to the bottom edge and now they are much more comfortable.  I bent the bridge a little so that they would conform better to my eyes.  The band comes loose and has to be retied occasionally but that is no big deal.  I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Fit well, made from a softer rubber/plastic than the cheap colored ones I&#x27;ve seen in the past.  Assuming the protection is up to snuff, these are perfect.</li>
    <li> I just had these delivered yesterday. I&#x27;m about to start tanning for the first time in my life to get ready for vacation this year. I researched and found that eye protection is vital. While ordering some other items, I threw these goggles in with an order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re quite functional. The only issue I can see is the string. It&#x27;s not real sturdy. I got it installed, though. It looks like these will work fine for what I need. They do seem to provide a lot of eye protection. The price is good and delivery was quick, so I think I found my goggles. If anything changes once I&#x27;ve used them in a bed, I&#x27;ll update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I&#x27;ve seen, they probably get four stars.</li>
    <li> Way better eye protection than I&#x27;ve had before. The black blocks out almost all of the light, and the elastic strap keeps them feeling very secure. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use anything else again.</li>
    <li> They are goggles you use in the tanning both, they work and are of decent quality.</li>
    <li> Works great and fits great.</li>
    <li> they worked very well. Light weight, string is comfortable and I can keep my eyes open without having to squint. Great goggles.</li>
    <li> These little goggles give a good fit. They cover just enough to protect the eye areas but are not so big as to leave bright white raccoon eye circles. I would recommend them for the goggles but do not use the string to hold them on myself, just my preference.</li>
    <li> I got these so I don&#x27;t get suntan lines on my face from my sunglasses and yes, they work wonderfully. Also they are very soft so they don&#x27;t hurt when worn. My children love them as well and I have found them to be a great way to entertain them.  :)</li>
    <li> These goggles are as expected and do the job.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations love them</li>
    <li> Works very well.  It has a closed hole where you can tie a knot to it and it won&#x27;t come lose or slip. Stays tight.  Keeps out sun tanning rays.</li>
    <li> They work fine.  Fit right on top of the eye.  Not bad for a couple bucks. They look like they will hold up.</li>
    <li> Comfortable,  rubber-like. Better than others I have borrowed at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> The string that attaches to the goggles is repeatedly coming undone and falling off. They work when they&#x27;re tied, but they fail when the string becomes loose again.</li>
    <li> Good eye protection. Recommended.</li>
    <li> The elastic band snaps off easily. Not made very well.</li>
    <li> The block the UV in the booths.  Not much else to say on these.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use with a facial light therapy device, which has a very strong and bright light. These goggles really cut down on the painfully bright light and stayed on my head without a problem. If there is any negative at all it&#x27;s that you have to make the elastic cord fairly loose so it doesn&#x27;t press on your eyeballs which is pretty uncomfortable.  The goggles themselves seems to be pretty sturdy, the cord a bit flimsy, but it does the job. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These are great. They work as they&#x27;re supposed to and the elastic band allows you to customize the fit to your head. They are small, perfectly fitting your eyes in the tanning bed. For the price, these are perfect.</li>
    <li> Cheap and gets the job done</li>
