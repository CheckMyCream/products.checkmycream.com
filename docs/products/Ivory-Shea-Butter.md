      <li>it&#x27;s a full 18 ounces and love it !</li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty good, my wife mixes it with cocoa butter to make lotion.</li>
      <li>best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found yet for NE winter dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Great packaging, very professional looking.</li>
      <li>I think this is a large quantity for a fair price.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ventured into making my own cream but love it.  </li>
      <li>it stores perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>Really cheap packaging.  </li>
      <li>The picture above show a plastic container that looks neat and great for storage.</li>
      <li>product- smooth and creamy-</li>
      <li>Authentic and fresh shea butter.</li>
      <li>In fact, some first time users of Shea Butter occasionally say the smell of Shea Butter is not the most attractive smell.</li>
      <li>creamy.&lt;br /&gt;have read other reviews about the smell not being pleasant but this has a nice mild smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t mind it since it honestly makes my skin smooth and healthy with no back acne .</li>
      <li>Excited to try it</li>
      <li>Unrefined shea butter will not be bright yellow unless a root dye extract has been added to it.</li>
      <li>Packaging came in a completely different container than what is shown but its still all good.</li>
      <li>Thanks for such a great product that does not have anything in it that can cause skin irritation</li>
      <li>The product has many different uses, I am sure you will find a way to tailor it to your needs.</li>
      <li>so I melted some down and added it to some baby lotion to carry it.mixed it in real good and let me tell you my skin is the healthier than it was when I was 18 yrs old.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell on its own either.</li>
      <li>Added to lotion, you&#x27;re golden.</li>
      <li>I learned about this product by watching many natural hair videos on Youtube.</li>
      <li>Just received and am sure I am going to be very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be very soft and</li>
      <li>Soft pliable easy to dip out.</li>
      <li>The pricing is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>It does feel a bit grainy at first</li>
      <li>Thanks !</li>
      <li>Eventually, I realized buying pure and unrefined shea butter was the way to go.</li>
      <li>I would not buy this product again, but if you really are in need of shea butter</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I used this as a base for my own lotions and it was great to try something new.</li>
      <li>WHAT I GOT was a square plastic container that I&#x27;ve only seen Chinease restaurants use when you order a dinner special combo.</li>
      <li>I must admit it is not as soft and creamy as the first time I purchased it.</li>
      <li>this is a decent purchase</li>
      <li>Now that I live in a remote town in Germany and have become a \\&quot;natural sister\\&quot;, finding quality shea butter is very important.</li>
      <li>Once you smell pure natural Shea Butter, you will always know the smell.</li>
      <li>Saves money so I definitely like it not to mention mixing this with raw cocoa makes some good moisturizing lotion.</li>
      <li>, Premium Shea Butter is a soft uniformly beige colored creamy solid that readily melts in the hands and is quickly absorbed by the skin.</li>
      <li>its nice and thick, keeps me soft, but bottom line, its not what was pictured!</li>
      <li>now purchased this product twice from this seller, and both times the product was consistent with what proper Shea should be.</li>
      <li>It did melt quickly, however the really creamy and soft texture is missing from this product.</li>
      <li>I can clearly tell there is a difference in the product.</li>
      <li>Ivory Shea Butter is like it says so soft and  creamy.</li>
      <li>At room temperature, using a butter knife, Premium Shea Butter spreads very nicely as soft butter or margarine does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin glows like a goddess.every old scar I&#x27;ve ever had is disappering, old stretch marks from having babies</li>
      <li>Your skin soaks it up and leaves you feeling velvety soft.</li>
      <li>I applied it on my skin thus so far.</li>
      <li>As all natural products vary, so does shea butter.</li>
      <li>When left in a hot room or near a heat source, Shea Butter will readily melt just as any other butter.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, pure natural Shea Butter has a characteristic smell.</li>
      <li>very disappointed, product came with no paper work or best way to use, no paper work at all evening saying it was the real thing</li>
      <li>I live in nevada where it gets up to 130 degrees in the summer and as low as 20 degrees in the winter..</li>
      <li>My container is short, wide and black with a clear top.</li>
      <li>It has a heavy, nutty smell and it absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>naturally form a buttery yellow to an ivory color.</li>
      <li>It definitely left my skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>It is not like the pictured &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34;, it is more like the poorly packaged frozen dinner container.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product and quick shipping</li>
    <li> Ordered it to make my own homemade body lotion. Arrived on time and in a plastic container. Nice smell. Would order again</li>
    <li> I purchased 32.oz ivory raw shea butter about 2 months ago.I live in nevada where it gets up to 130 degrees in the summer and as low as 20 degrees in the winter..in addition to that I am several types of medication.needless to say this lifestyle is killing my skin..when I recieved my shea butter It was extremely firm so I melted some down and added it to some baby lotion to carry it.mixed it in real good and let me tell you my skin is the healthier than it was when I was 18 yrs old.I&#x27;m now 39yrs. My skin glows like a goddess.every old scar I&#x27;ve ever had is disappering, old stretch marks from having babies are smoothing out.not to mention the supple softness of my skin..don&#x27;t worry about the smell of the product it just simply means its raw and natural, un tampered with isn&#x27;t that what we want? You can always add it to a perfumed lotion..but I would stay away from adding it to almond oil or any other type of oil..unless you want to look and feel like a grease ball..lotion is sufficient trust me on this!!</li>
    <li> April 8- 2016. received my second order -  this time it&#x27;s a full 18 ounces and love it ! I will definitely keep ordering   January 2016 This product just arrived .  It isn&#x27;t 18 ounces .. Just 16.  I was disappointed that it did not come in a container (just a plastic bag ). Fortunately, I have some spare containers that worked nicely .  Looks to be good quality.  Excited to try it</li>
    <li> Very wonderful moisturizer, but it is really greasy. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell on its own either. Added to lotion, you&#x27;re golden.</li>
    <li> I am not new to shea butter. As a child, I suffered from severe eczema. Shea butter has been a staple skin care product in my life. Eventually, I realized buying pure and unrefined shea butter was the way to go. Now that I live in a remote town in Germany and have become a \\&quot;natural sister\\&quot;, finding quality shea butter is very important. I learned about this product by watching many natural hair videos on Youtube. The product did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my skin and hair. I make my hair creams with this product and get great results. The pricing is very reasonable. If you are unsure about buying this product I would suggest you try the 8 oz tub. The product has many different uses, I am sure you will find a way to tailor it to your needs.</li>
    <li> I received it on time and it is exactly how it is described, a pale, very thick, yellow buttery texture. I am and have been a Chapstick user for years. My lips feel dry if I don&#x27;t have it on during the day and at night. I apply Shea butter on them now instead and although they don&#x27;t feel dry, they don&#x27;t feel as moist as they do with Chapstick. As for my hands and face, I can&#x27;t tell what to expect until the cold dry winter weather arrives here in Canada. My fingertips often get painful cracks from the dryness, so I hope this product will alleviate this problem. I have put the butter on my hands every evening since I received it, and I can feel a slight bit of dry flakes of skin on my fingertips, so I&#x27;m not sure if it will work.  I guess time will tell.</li>
    <li> very disappointed, product came with no paper work or best way to use, no paper work at all evening saying it was the real thing</li>
    <li> The product you get will NOT look like the picture it is already whipped or processed in some other way.  Also it is not in the package in the picture either it is in a black plastic bowl w/ a typed sticker on it. DO NOT BUY FROM LAKESIDE MALL!!!</li>
    <li> Really cheap packaging.  It is not like the pictured &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34;, it is more like the poorly packaged frozen dinner container. Cover is cracked open probably from impact during handling.  Shea butter seems good quality and genuine.</li>
    <li> I ordered, what I thought was in the pic. What arrived was a black, microwaveable plate with butter that had grayish tint. its nice and thick, keeps me soft, but bottom line, its not what was pictured!</li>
    <li> As this product was extremely different than the Pure Raw Unrefined Shea I received from a different seller (which was thick, heavy, and very yellow and greasy), I did additional research, and thought it would be beneficial to pass along this information from the American Shea Butter Institute as well as a few other resources. The Shea from Lakeside Mall does seem to be the authentic Shea. See below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter varies in color naturally form a buttery yellow to an ivory color. As all natural products vary, so does shea butter. Unrefined shea butter will not be bright yellow unless a root dye extract has been added to it. Color is not an indicator of age. Range in color based on the harvest time of the shea nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is recommended to use Shea butter within 18 months from date of extraction from seed to get maximum benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At room temperature, Premium Shea Butter is a soft uniformly beige colored creamy solid that readily melts in the hands and is quickly absorbed by the skin. When left in a hot room or near a heat source, Shea Butter will readily melt just as any other butter. At room temperature, using a butter knife, Premium Shea Butter spreads very nicely as soft butter or margarine does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter is not yellow, green, gray, dark brown, or white. Shea products with these colors are modified substitutes sometimes bearing the name 100% Shea Butter. Furthermore, pure natural Shea Butter has a characteristic smell. Once you smell pure natural Shea Butter, you will always know the smell. In fact, some first time users of Shea Butter occasionally say the smell of Shea Butter is not the most attractive smell. However, after 10 or 20 minutes on the body the butter has no smell. Unaltered Shea Butter does not have a cologne or perfume fragrance. If your Shea Butter does not have the characteristic smell, color and does not spread like butter, it is probably not a good quality Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - it&#x27;s a very heavy, very earthy, oily, nutty smell, but would not be described as rancid or overpoweringly bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sources:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve now purchased this product twice from this seller, and both times the product was consistent with what proper Shea should be. It arrives in a \\&quot;to go\\&quot; type of container and with an extra bag around it. I take out what I need into a small mason jar and keep the rest in the container it arrived in with a ziplock around it and it stores perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> Great as always. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Ivory Shea Butter is like it says so soft and  creamy. Your skin soaks it up and leaves you feeling velvety soft.</li>
    <li> Thanks for such a great product that does not have anything in it that can cause skin irritation no allergic reaction Yea!!</li>
    <li> I use this on my body along with coconut oil (whipped together). It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Authentic and fresh shea butter. Thanks !</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!!! Bought some for my lil sister severe eczema has made a world of difference for her love it</li>
    <li> I received my product in a timely manner. This is my second time ordering it. I must admit it is not as soft and creamy as the first time I purchased it. I have not applied it on my hair as of yet. I applied it on my skin thus so far. I can clearly tell there is a difference in the product. It did melt quickly, however the really creamy and soft texture is missing from this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff works so well on my natural 3c curly hair. I whipped it up with other oils  and I love it! Best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> My Hair feels great with this product.  I have also been using it  on my skin.  Will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good, my wife mixes it with cocoa butter to make lotion. Saves money so I definitely like it not to mention mixing this with raw cocoa makes some good moisturizing lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer, though I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. I still would recommend this product to a friend, however. Use in recipes for hand creams and lotions!</li>
    <li> Used to make diaper rash cream which seems to work well.  I think this is a large quantity for a fair price.</li>
    <li> I used this as a base for my own lotions and it was great to try something new.Great packaging, very professional looking.</li>
    <li> The butter arrived in a rectangular black tray with a plastic lid, similar to what you would get from a Chinese restaurant or somewhere similar. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with that. The butter is gritty but I take a bit and rub it between my hands and it softens immediately. It has a heavy, nutty smell and it absorbs quickly. It definitely left my skin feeling soft. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Just received and am sure I am going to be very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be very soft and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;have read other reviews about the smell not being pleasant but this has a nice mild smell.&lt;br /&gt;I will update after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with African black soap , and it&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t cause me acne. It&#x27;s got a nasty barbeque burning smell to it but I don&#x27;t mind it since it honestly makes my skin smooth and healthy with no back acne .</li>
    <li> The consistency and color is different from what I am used to getting but I still like the product.  The packaging is much different from the picture. My container is short, wide and black with a clear top.</li>
    <li> Good consistency.Packaging came in a completely different container than what is shown but its still all good.It does feel a bit grainy at first but once its given a good rub between your hands it melts smooth.</li>
    <li> Soft pliable easy to dip out.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is beautiful and my wrinkled hands are already showing signs of improvement.</li>
    <li> The shea butter is the best moisturizer there is.  It is all natural, not full of chemicals.  I use it after every shower and as a hand cream.  It seems to have helped my dry brittle nails.</li>
    <li> The product smells very odd.  I have smelled raw shea butter before and didn&#x27;t think it was supposed to smell this way. (Maybe I&#x27;m ignorant about shea butter.) But I have no complaints about the way it performs.</li>
    <li> best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found yet for NE winter dry skin.  Feels greasy for a short time and then it soaks in.</li>
    <li> The Shea butter I received today is of a good quality , it has a great light \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; scent,  it doesn&#x27;t feel grainy  and the butter is hard but this was shipped to me and it&#x27;s only 28 degrees Fahrenheit  outside. My only problem is packaging. The picture above show a plastic container that looks neat and great for storage. WHAT I GOT was a square plastic container that I&#x27;ve only seen Chinease restaurants use when you order a dinner special combo. I don&#x27;t like it because I feel much more of the Shea Butter will be in contact with air when you open the container, so I will be transferring all this butter to a glass airtight jar.</li>
    <li> it was harder than i thought it would be but melted and blended well with other oils.  it was ok</li>
    <li> The butter came in a closed tuboware. But after doing more research, I realized that one never knows the safety of the shea butter products they&#x27;re purchasing. I would not buy this product again, but if you really are in need of shea butter this is a decent purchase</li>
    <li> Great quality, used it in soap.</li>
    <li> I love it ... thank you</li>
    <li> really nice product- smooth and creamy- nice packaging and delivery- really good deal-</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ventured into making my own cream but love it.  Mix it with sweet almond oil, grape seed oil and have a wonderful moisturizing cream.  Add some essential oils and I have a great pain cream.  It&#x27;s interesting mixing everything together but love the end product.</li>
    <li> This produc is just awful, I had to re-order some from Cleopatra company.</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes awesome body butter!</li>
