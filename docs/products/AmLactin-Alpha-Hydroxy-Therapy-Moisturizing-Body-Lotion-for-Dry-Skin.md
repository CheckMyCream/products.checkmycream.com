<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My 21 month old daughter has been diagnosed recently with a mild case of eczema and my pediatrician recommend this lotion for treatment.  Its quite expense but after one application her eczema was almost gone!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I&#x27;ve started using it myself on my feet and legs and I cannot believe how soft my skin is now.</li>
    <li> Takes a long time to soak in, feels a little greasy, but the next morning skin is smooth!</li>
    <li> Description is misleading - 15.9oz TOTAL (not each bottle - blow up picture to see the small print). I love this lotion however as it keeps my feet from cracking.</li>
    <li> This purchase was my 2nd time buying this product. My skin is smoother. Recommend.</li>
    <li> It seems fine don&#x27;t know yet if its a added plus but it does feel good going on and goes into skin very well</li>
    <li> Good product and odorless.</li>
    <li> This is the Universe&#x27;s hidden secret. I came upon this product as a pre-cancer skin patient. My doctor recommended this product to me over 20 years ago, and I&#x27;ve yet to find anything comparable.</li>
    <li> Really like it, has made my skin really soft and supple. It is very light and moisturizing but not greasy. Recommend, just remember to use sunscreen as well</li>
    <li> A lot of people have recommended this to me because I have KP on my legs and often struggle with dry skin in some areas due to eczema and this has helped a TON. I have a dark complexion (I&#x27;m African American) and I was worried that the percentage of acid (don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not bad acid, it&#x27;s safe!) might be too high for my skin and cause it to dark due to PIH but so far it&#x27;s been nothing but wonderful. I use this on my legs after I shave in the shower and it leaves it SMOOTH like butter by the next day. Because of KP, my legs are always bumpy and are covered in dark brown dots. I&#x27;ve been told that over time this will help get rid of the dots as well, but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know for sure. When using this make sure you ALWAYS wear sunscreen on the areas you put it on! If you don&#x27;t it will make your skin darken. Use it at night, sunscreen in the morning. Also try avoiding using it every day and give your skin a break. Another thing I&#x27;d like to add is that I have used this on my bikini/genital area (AROUND, NOT INSIDE) to smooth it out after shaving and it works like a charm. (If you choose to do that, you only need to apply it once. Don&#x27;t overdo it)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of good results because of this product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and this was a great price. I sometimes get bumps on my arms, and this lotion makes them go away. It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. Doesn&#x27;t stay on the surface of the skin and make me feel gross all day. It goes on and moisturizes fast. I love it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great.  Transaction was speedy and what I expected.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!!! I have been used it for almost 10 years now can&#x27;t leave without it.</li>
    <li> its a good lotion, but i do like the way it feels on my skin so i will be use it on.a. my feet and elbows</li>
    <li> I love AmLactin ever since I discovered it a couple of years ago! I have hot dry feet and if I use this product one to two times a day (two is best) it keeps the soles of my feet exfoliated, soft, and smooth. It beats the heck out of my previous method that involved a drill and a sanding disk. A word of caution, if you have a sensitive skin issue depending on your usage this product may irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> I kid you not, this lotion is the only product that works on my skin. I&#x27;ve had super dry skin as long as I can remember. My thirsty skin is desert dry, so I have to use this lotion to get silky skin results that last. If you skin is dry like mine is - which is even worse now that I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with hypothyroidism. I usually buy this product at Costco or Sam&#x27;s Club. But, buying it here (this time, anyway)  it was a better price. I don&#x27;t have money to waste buying a lotion that is gone, showing with no type of effect, as soon as I apply it. But, AmLactin... it really works!</li>
    <li> It went on well. Not greasy, not nasty at all. I bought it for my &#x27;chicken skin&#x27;  and it didnt help at all.</li>
    <li> Finally!!!! I have tried everything within my budget, even making my own creams.........this is the best!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00T7260EC AmLactin Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Moisturizing Body Lotion for Dry Skin, Fragrance-Free, White, 15.8 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> The product is so bad</li>
    <li> After looking for an answer to help my very dry skin my dermatologist recommended that I try Amlactin.  So I thought why not I have nothing to lose.  As soon as it arrived I began using it and I can&#x27;t believe how great this moisturizing lotion works.  In a very short time period it has worked miracles on my hands and feet.  I love, love, love it.&lt;br /&gt;Just know that you have to order this off the internet because it is not available in stores.  It is well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion for my bumpy skin!</li>
    <li> Cured my very dry flakey skin!! Leaves my&lt;br /&gt;72 year old skin soft.  If you have dry cracked&lt;br /&gt;skin I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever! Cannot be without. I&#x27;ve even started using on my face!</li>
    <li> This is an AMAZING product!  Although the instructions advise the user to apply the lotion twice/day, I typically apply it each morning following my shower (for whatever reason, I tend to forget to apply again at night.)  The good news, is that the once/day application has honestly changed the look and feel of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a woman of 50+ years with skin that&#x27;s beginning to show signs of aging and sun damage.  I&#x27;m delighted to have discovered this lotion that has provided such pleasant results!  The skin on my arms and legs has lightened and softened -- the overall look is more youthful.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> This cream works; you skin will be smoother.</li>
    <li> my dermatologist recommended this for the red bumps on the back of my arms and it works great!</li>
