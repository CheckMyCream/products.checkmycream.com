<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good price using S&amp;S.</li>
    <li> Good price, same great quality as expected</li>
    <li> I have eczema. My forehead and the sides of my legs turn very dark when irritated. Vaseline is the only product that I&#x27;ve ever used that consistently works. My skin lightens up in a matter of days. I have natural hair (4C) and it also makes my curl pattern looks moist and defined. The only side effect is build up on my hair after long use. So, I use a cleanser every few weeks to get the build up off.  I have to use a cleanser to remove build for other (non-vaseline) products too For my twist outs, I do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash my hair&lt;br /&gt;2) Part it into 4 sections&lt;br /&gt;3) Take a few strands of hair&lt;br /&gt;4) Dip my fingers into the vaseline to get a little on the tips&lt;br /&gt;5) Twist my hair&lt;br /&gt;6) Let the hair dry over night&lt;br /&gt;7) Take the twist down and my hair is full of curls</li>
    <li> Just a nice, large container of vaseline.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal product. I noticed a trend whenever I met an older woman with beautiful glowing skin, if I asked her secret, she would laugh and say nothing - just a little vaseline. I decided to try and am amazed. I use a tiny bit nightly mixed with warm water on my skin. Simple and nothing else compares.</li>
    <li> Bought this for our camping trip. I mix half a teaspoon of vaseline (any 100% petroleum oil) with a cotton ball and it&#x27;ll burn for about 10 minutes. Great fire starter.</li>
    <li> Where was Vaseline all my life?  Well, I never gave it due respect and it serves me right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three days ago, I made a discovery about the wonder that is Vaseline.  So I&#x27;ve been going nuts over Vaseline for 3 days now, and am a happy camper.  Really, the possibilities are endless....................</li>
    <li> Good quality product, was packaged nicely - will order again.</li>
    <li> Everyone has their own use for vaseline. Mine is applying to lips year round and especially during Winter.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that is keeping my skin from cracking! We are having a very cold winter in upstate New York. I have use coconut oil in the past to moisturizer my skin. I have very sensitive and dry skin, most products burn my face when I apply them. I started to use Vaseline and I wish I had sooner!! It&#x27;s a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to have this much vaseline at home, but putting your hands inside the container every time you need some is not a good idea. It&#x27;s my only complain but if you don&#x27;t care just ignore my review.</li>
    <li> The Vaseline has a funny smell to it....other than that it does its purpose.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34; Liquid Wrench&amp;#34; &amp;#34; for chaffing and irritation from jock straps to imported pointy toed shoes&lt;br /&gt;or underwear and the best way to get the color off your skin after dying the grey out...&lt;br /&gt;More uses limited only to one&#x27;s imagination...</li>
    <li> Price was good. Product delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Very effective and very cheap.</li>
    <li> Vaseline. Fine and dandy. Arrived in great shape. I really like the container shape and the kind of lid. No need to twist to open it up. Simply pleasing. Does what it does.</li>
    <li> I just got lucky on this deal and got a great buy on a great product .</li>
    <li> Great price! Bought several of these because this is the cheapest I have ever seen them!</li>
    <li> Great product. Very simple.</li>
    <li> Works great on dry skin, childhood eczema, and under diapers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new lid is a really nice feature, although it will break with daily use after around a month or so. (2 of 2 so far...)</li>
    <li> Reasonable value. Nice size. This is about as a good a deal as you can find without getting out to a nearby chain store.&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> I had my son buy a jar at a walk-in but he came back with a fragrance so I used the web and got exactly what I wanted with no damage. A good deal at a good price.</li>
    <li> I use it every night on my hands and put it on my feet under socks in the winter - keeps them soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this for remove eye makeup, it is THE best so far in eye makeup department, and it&#x27;s super cheap!</li>
    <li> I use this for two things. One is to put on my lips before bed, the other is my main use which is as eye makeup remover. I have tried like fifteen different eye makeup removers and this is the only one my eyes can tolerate long term. Others make my eyelids (top and bottom) red, dry/scaly and unbearably itchy after prolonged use. But not this. I take a dab, massage it onto my eyelids, let sit for a few seconds, take a baby wipe and wipe clean. And to be honest it takes everything off quickly without any harsh rubbing unlike a lot of eye makeup removers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Good, but not odorless - it&#x27;s smells like petroleum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was a kid! Vaseline is great for so many things. Dry skin, chapped lips, minor cuts and scraps. I use this as a makeup remover, on my lips and as an overnight foot mask. I put this on my feet after my shower at night, put on a pair of sock and my feet stay super soft and smooth the next day! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! With awesome pricing! I couldn&#x27;t find a price ANYWHERE that beat this! It is a huge container! The packaging was great! I would definitely recommend!!! I was  very pleased!</li>
    <li> Everyone should have vaseline in their home! So many uses.</li>
    <li> I use this over my normal lotion but you can use it alone too. Works great overnight, leaving skin *face, arms, legs* smooth and soft. It&#x27;s also perfect for winter when that freezing air whips across your face because it&#x27;s a barrier from the elements. Petroleum gets a bad rep but it has never done ANY type of harm to my skin. If anything, I feel better since I found it. Love! Of course, this isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; but an occlusive, which means it stays on top of skin rather than sink in too deeply. However, I still feel moisturized.</li>
    <li> Vaseline is good for your body! I use it everyday to keep my skin fresh</li>
    <li> Awesome buy thank you</li>
    <li> I use vaseline petroleum jelly to moisten my hands and cuticles. My manicurist says that it&#x27;s made a big difference in helping dry nails and cuticles.</li>
    <li> I used this product as a fire starter for camping purposes.&lt;br /&gt;You just need to soak or mix a glob of this stuff with some cotton balls and you have a homemade fire-starting kit that&#x27;s honestly better than anything you can buy in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Once soaked store in a zip lock bag until ready to use. When you need to make a fire, pull out one of the cotton balls and fluff it up (pull it apart, but not into pieces). Then just light it up. It will burn strong and hot for a few minutes allowing you ample time to get your kindling, tinder, and fuel burning.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I use this as a prepping tool to start a camp fire  Works great with a flint</li>
    <li> Great, as always.  Nothing beats the original stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  Great stuff !!  We use to call it &amp;#34;the first aid kit in a jar&amp;#34;.  Good price also.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Can be better, like hidratant</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like vaseline? lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it but the other day I realized that it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy at walmart, so.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I wish it didn&#x27;t literally smell like Petrol... hate the smell</li>
    <li> Great product as usual</li>
    <li> Classic. Nothing else needs be said.</li>
    <li> Large quantity and product is always wonderful and never changes for the many years used in our household.  Always recommended by my dermotologist for my issues.</li>
    <li> Read online somewhere that Vaseline is recommended for diaper rash and my baby was getting them pretty frequently. Use this after every diaper change and no more diaper rash.</li>
    <li> Very good deal and great product</li>
    <li> Yum, this stuff is deliciously slippery and thick at the same time. I love using it to help moisturize and add just the right amount of slick to whatever I am wiping.  Highly recommended.  It never goes bad!</li>
    <li> Used this for applying onto my eyebrows before applying sunless tanner. Works as described. What more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my pediatrician to use Vaseline instead of lotion to moisturize my son&#x27;s skin. So far so good, plus it didn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all.</li>
    <li> great for one&#x27;s skin!</li>
    <li> It was great...very slippery ..and it felt good ...&lt;br /&gt;Personal use ...so I&#x27;ll skip the rest</li>
    <li> Great buy, but this is vaseline what can you say about it.  I bought it to make firestarters with cottonballs and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Growing up, a jar of Vaseline was always a useful product to have around and it&#x27;s now I always keep it at home.  It has many uses, but mostly I use it as a great moisturizer for elbows and knees to keep them smooth.  I recommend this product wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, IT is the real Petroleum Jelly, nothing more to it. I think the price is perfect.</li>
    <li> Came on time and is bigger than I expected, I thought it was going to be a small thing but it&#x27;s a pretty good size. It will definitely last a while!</li>
    <li> The only thing that can moisturize my hair without making it look greasy or making it frizzy. And I love the size it&#x27;s HUGE!</li>
    <li> This is just enough to entirely coat an adult human or a couple kids.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe when a got such a big container within $5. It works great and is much cheaper than you can get in walmart or other stores.</li>
    <li> I am going to be 44 years old this December. The ladies in my family all worked in the beauty and fashion industry in one form or another so I learned many many tips. If you have a fragrance that you just love and it will not hold very long, this happens with very expensive fragrances too, apply the vaseline to the areas you spray or dab or perfume and it will last for days even because one application of vaseline is proven to last 7 days. It works with all fragrances men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s. The secret to amazing skin is baby oil soaked in the bath or a homemade sugar scrub in the shower made with vaseline, add sugar and cinnamon oh yeah, dry off wile skin is still warm apply moisturizer whichever you choose. Make that a habit and your skin will be amazing and it will hold all those perfumes too. I use the scrub on my face as well and not to brag but I will be 44 this year and I don&#x27;t have the first line on my face or body because I&#x27;ve used vaseline all my life. Now I use the vaseline lotions too.</li>
    <li> Product is amazing for my dry Wintery chapped hands! Its exactly what I was looking for!!! I was using two products &amp; this was the heavy duty product I needed for the evening!</li>
    <li> I use this to remove my eye makeup.  I have eczema and can&#x27;t use makeup remover.  Plus the moisture is good for my eyes anyway.  I don&#x27;t use a lot, so this giant tub with it&#x27;s super low price will last me for quite a while!  A small container was going to be $4 at our local store, and this is four times that size.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> I use it to slick my hair back. Many brands of pomade (e.g. Royal Crown) use petrolatum as the main ingredient, so this is the same thing, minus the olive oil and fragrance. Whatever floats your boat.</li>
    <li> not hard to rate when it is 100% petroleum jelly, with nothing else added. Decent price over local stores too.</li>
    <li> I been using Vaseline all my life I love the product, I have dry skin and it helps a lot and you cam use it all over the body.</li>
    <li> I feel that a jar of Vaseline is a must have in every home. I suffered with very dry and flaky hands/feet for many years, went to a dermatologist few times, tried several prescription creams and nothing helped me. A friend at work suggested to try Vaseline and within a week my hands became so soft. Now I have a tub at home, at work, in purse, in car and in my travel bag. Try applying everyday to your feet and see the difference, they become so soft.</li>
    <li> There is a simple reason, make that two, that I will not buy Vaseline Brand Petroleum Jelly again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Since it is recommended by doctors to apply to an open wound after minor surgery, especially if there are stitches, it is considered a medicine. Vaseline has stopped using safety seals under their caps, yes that’s right, anyone can open a Vaseline bottle in the store or anywhere else and put anything they want in there, where it can go right into your open wound ... or on your baby&#x27;s skin. To save a fraction of one penny Vaseline is putting the health of millions of people at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. When I wrote to Vaseline expressing my concern I received the typical computer-generated form letter response, promising a reply soon. That was over TWO months ago and instead Vaseline just chose to ignore me, hoping I would go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t go away, Vaseline … I wrote this fair, honest and truthful review. It’s what you deserve for compromising the health of your customers and then trying to sweep it under the carpet.</li>
    <li> It works like how petroleum jelly should. The best part is it doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell like some other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I use it for chapped lips, cracked feet, dry skin and most importantly my nose which is always dry and red on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must have for me. I am never without one (or two). I scoop it out with a plastic spoon and distribute it into tiny containers so I have vaseline everywhere I need it (and several back ups). Definitely cheaper since I don&#x27;t have to buy SEVERAL tiny ones.</li>
    <li> We use regular petroleum jelly which actually is more pure than the baby version which has added fragrance. Forms protective layer and prevents diaper rash for babies</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Arrived on time, as expected. I was very pleased, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Is all that was expected.  Jar is a little larger than thought when ordered, but that is hardly an issue.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s vaseline…..does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
    <li> ok so the product is the same as I have bought for years ... but I love the new lid!</li>
    <li> SLUG LIFE!!! thought I was crazy to slather it all over my face after my moisturizer but it has turned my skin around. So soft and anything I picked at has healed super crazy fast. No new breakouts as well, it&#x27;s amazing. Vaseline is magic guys.</li>
    <li> Vaseline has always been a great product and it hasn&#x27;t changed throughout the years.  This is a BIG container and will last for quite awhile.  I use this for dry skin irritations and it works just great among other uses.  It&#x27;s also a great lubricant when your ring is just a bit tight on a hot day and you can&#x27;t get it off.  Vaseline is uniquely versatile and this size is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Living in vietnam.  . .. This large tub is Great for everything from burns,  cuts, cracked Lipps.  Also easy on her Lipps as well:).,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s vaseline. You can lube your window tracks, your butt, or your feet. It&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> 13 Oz is a lot of vaseline. Lots of applications, I guess, but it is not food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may never need any more vaseline, though I would buy from them again if I ever needed more pure petroleum jelly</li>
    <li> i just love vaseline!! its an amazing multi function product..i use it for many things...tried def brands but always come back to this original brand!</li>
    <li> It smells  comfortable,I like it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema so we go through Vaseline quickly, so at $3 it was a great deal</li>
    <li> Excellent vaseline for fights and impromptu throwdowns. Will prevent cuts and scars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a huge tub and will last me years and years to come. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a thin layer over my moisturizer at night, wearing the whole thing to bed, and wake up with happy and healthy skin. This is excellent for sealing in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It requires changing the pillowcases more often, but the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> Great size and the liding is great compared to the old one that seemed to pop off and difficult to align.  This is hinged so makes it a snap.  The product is tried and true pure Petroleum Jelly and helps with wound and dry skin issues.  It is also great to add essential oils to for breathing treatments.  We even use it to make fire starters with cotton balls for camping!</li>
    <li> Used with our son after his circumcision based on doctor recommendations... we went through tons of this!!  gentle on his young skin.</li>
    <li> Vaseline.....still the same.  Well worth the price and size is larger than I can purchase locally.  Use it on so many things.  Chickens, water hose, tools, people etc. etc.  A must have around the house.</li>
    <li> I like it. Good quality. Works. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love?  It&#x27;s Vaseline, the worlds most effective and cheapest skin cream out there.  Sure, it&#x27;s greasy, it&#x27;s Vaseline, after all.  Those fancy products that cost more per ounce than this thing costs by the gallon, can&#x27;t hold a candle to it in terms of results.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you hope for and remember from Vaseline brand:  good value and quality.</li>
    <li> USING THIS BEFORE WASHING OR DRYING MY SKIN, HAIR, AND FEET MADE MY SKIN SOFTER THAN IT HAS BEEN IN YEARS.</li>
    <li> what can say?  it&#x27;s vaseline.  if you want petroleum jelly this is the most consistent and least slimy product.</li>
    <li> At the doctors suggestion I use this to slow down the development of diabetic neuropithy.  I seems to help.  Otherwise I have not used it for anything else.</li>
    <li> SO BIG. BUT SO CHEAP.</li>
    <li> As good as I&#x27;ve come to expect from Vaseline. You will not be disappointed with this product. Keep it up.</li>
    <li> I got tired of the store brands so i purchased the REAL thing.Vaselile has so many uses and at this price is a no-brainer...;</li>
    <li> The original and can never get old. Good for dry skin and helps in winters. One of the best petroleum jellies.</li>
    <li> for the price it sucks I can go to walmart and get 2 or 3 of these at this price the only reason I got in here is because I thought being $8 it would be a case of more then 1 but no luck... all in all it is what it says it is and if you can only get things by mail then all means.</li>
    <li> This stuff has plenty of uses, know wha&#x27;m sayin&#x27;?</li>
    <li> Lube up with the original. Whether its dry skin, cuts, scrapes, burns, or protection for your face in a boxing match vaseline is a product i use daily, and probably will forever.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t thinking about how big 13 ounces is - it&#x27;s a lot in a fairly large container , so good value for money.</li>
    <li> You can literally use this on any orifice on the human body. Seriously. Also, 13 ounces is easily enough to cover the entire lower half of your body.</li>
    <li> Plastic Odor. I compared it with same product in local pharmacy store, and did not find the smell in the one in local store. I don&#x27;t know whether it is returnable or not.</li>
    <li> Great value. Highly recommeded.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  It&#x27;s Vaseline.</li>
    <li> useful for whole family</li>
    <li> Dry skin... check! Chapped lips... check!  Fire starter... check!  Covers &amp; stops rash irritation... check! Protects cuts... check!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I went for so long without using vaseline as much as I could.&lt;br /&gt;I keep a little tub at work, in my purse, in my nightstand, bathroom, first aid kit... it&#x27;s like a good friend, just always good to have around ;)</li>
    <li> HUGE container. I didn&#x27;t realize how big this was. Great value.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! This is perfect if you run out of makeup remover, moisturizing the skin around the eye, removal of blackheads, and even the growth of your eyelashes and eyebrows. I put this stuff on my eyebrows, eyelid, and eyelashes every night and I wake up to my eyes being refreshed and I saw improvements in my eyebrow thickness after just two weeks!</li>
    <li> Pediatrician recommended for our baby&#x27;s skin. It works very well!</li>
    <li> For chapped lips and dry, cracked, hands &amp; feet that come with Minnesota winters, nothing beats Vaseline Petroleum Jelly. It doesn&#x27;t look or smell as sexy as the expensive &amp;#34;dermatology-approved&amp;#34; lotions, but it works much better. If I get a cracked cuticle, I rub-in Vaseline, then apply a small blob of it and cover with a Band-Aid - it&#x27;s completely healed within a day or so.</li>
    <li> Vaseline is a household staple. I use it for babies. the protective barrier helps keep skin moist. everyone should have this in their home for skin problems. I love the large size.</li>
    <li> Bigger size than I imagine but will last througout the year, I definitely will not require buying from the base exchange.</li>
    <li> Good big box of Vaseline. Good for families. Quality product and 13 ounce is more than enough to last for the whole of winter</li>
    <li> I love Vaseline simply because my hands are extremely chaffed. It moisturizes my hands far better than any other high end hand or body butter, and my trick is to always wet my hands before applying. Wetting your hands before applying will trap the moisture, which helps to prevent dry skin for hours. We normally do not need to purchase Vaseline very often, because one jar can almost last a lifetime. But when it&#x27;s time to purchase it, we come straight to Amazon. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Nature&#x27;s gift. Really useful for many purposes.</li>
    <li> i will never get tired of using this product.  have always used it and will continue using it for a long time to come</li>
    <li> typical lube and oxidation prevention product. Use it for threading in mechanical mods and others. Ease of use and cleaning with isopropyl alcohol.</li>
    <li> I now have had this for a year, lasts foreverrr.</li>
    <li> Vaseline, It&#x27;s exactly what it says It is.&lt;br /&gt;The container Is a lot bigger In person than It is In the picture.</li>
    <li> Vaseline is great for all sorts of uses especially the skin! It never fails!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just petroleum jelly. Nothing more, nothing less. I personally find it a bit too thick, but that&#x27;s the nature of the product. I&#x27;ve used less &#x27;tacky&#x27; petroleum jelly that had a less resilient consistency and smoothed a lot easier, which made it a pleasure to use for more...&#x27;intimate&#x27; applications. This however, isn&#x27;t quite the ticket for that sort of thing.</li>
    <li> Whats to say about vaseline. Its jelly and it works like it should. I dont really know what else to say.</li>
    <li> So many uses for this. It makes the best cut protection/healing ointment I&#x27;ve ever found, fantastic for protecting skin against the winter wind, is perfect for keeping hand and garden tools from getting rusty in storage, works well to lubricate hinges, seals leather....the list can go on and on.  How can you not give such a product a 5-star rating?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the practical side, the new packaging is great for easy, mess-free dispensing.</li>
    <li> I use this to remove the cloudy haze on my Rabybans frame. It works.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Smells like plastic. The jar must have been in a hot warehouse for a long time and absorbed the plastic or something. I use Vaseline on my toddler and refuse to use this jar. I&#x27;m a big fan on Amazon but this is disappointing.</li>
    <li> Big jar of Vaseline...My cardiologist recommended using this stuff in my nose to prevent nose bleeds induced by blood thinners I have to take.  It works!!</li>
    <li> I use this for my lips - keeps them nice and soft during the winter months.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Good value.</li>
    <li> We bought it for the baby as the moisturizer while changing diapers, but when in contact with pee, it would produce an awful smell. Where as similar jellies from other pharmacies are working very fine and do not produce any odor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Vaseline. What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> This is the classic Vaseline.  I bought it on Amazon because it was cheaper but I am always satisfied with this versatile product.</li>
    <li> Great for chapped everything in the cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;The medicated Vaseline worked best.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad they stopped making it!</li>
    <li> This was at a great price, better than buying it at the store</li>
    <li> Good product, what more can I say?</li>
    <li> It seems like I can&#x27;t find the large jar of UNSCENTED Vaseline in the store these days.  This was reasonably price and serves me well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with chapped lips all the time.  Nothing beats Vaseline to make it all better!</li>
    <li> Can never have enough of this. This &amp; neem oil is pretty much everything anyone needs for a brilliant complexion :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s normal Vaseline. Exactly what you would find in the store. It&#x27;s half the price of what I can find in the store and this container has almost twice as much in it. Very good deal.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I got such a great product for such an amazing price!! Was delivered very quickly too!</li>
    <li> I use Vaseline as a moisturizer, chap stick, and even use it on my little girl&#x27;s hair to tame the frizz. I have tried many store brands but nothing compares to Vaseline.</li>
    <li> It is what it is, it&#x27;s vaseline, there&#x27;s a lot of it, and the price is great. get it</li>
    <li> Good product as expected</li>
    <li> This is a nice and familiar product.  The lid is an innovation because it stays attached so no more dropping it.</li>
    <li> Economy sized Vaseline. It&#x27;s an inexpensive alternative to fancy sensitive skin creams. Keeps your skin from cracking and peeling.</li>
    <li> Great price and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this vaseline for my baby. I use it every day and it keeps my baby protected and skin so soft.</li>
