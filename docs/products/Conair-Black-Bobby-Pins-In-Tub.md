      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Great product, and a really great value more than enough hair pins to last a good while</li>

      <li>They do the trick and they were very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>very flimsy.  </li>

      <li>and they were a little more money.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: not best quality, but if you are like me and lose them often, then these are great &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>what i mean by this is that they slant off easily and they open way too easily</li>
      <li>I have to say that some are not as well made as others, but for the price I am fine with throwing a few out.</li>
      <li>These are so loose they couldn&#x27;t hold a baby&#x27;s bangs before their first hair cut.</li>
      <li>I bought this same item about 5 years ago, and just recently had to buy a new one.</li>

    <li> Super fast shipping, and there is sooooo many. üòÅ</li>
    <li> Great quality and quantity for a great price!</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are a waist of money. They do not stay in your hair. I like big hair and as soon as I was done putting it up it all fall out. I even tried crossing them together and it still did not work.</li>
    <li> very flimsy.  not worth it.</li>
    <li> Not as thick as I expected. I bought the conair brand because I thought I would get the thicker sturdier kind and they were a little more money. Was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product, and a really great value more than enough hair pins to last a good while, it takes a great deal of time to loose all 500 of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> What girl doesn&#x27;t need a big box of bobby pins?&lt;br /&gt;I know I do, and it definitely gets used just about everyday&lt;br /&gt;I have long, crazy hair and having a few bobby pins on me is always good to manage flyaways and the occasional bad hair day!</li>
    <li> these are great cheap bobby pins, does well with buns, and the metal is good quality so does not bend after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> never run out of bobby pins again.  Great price</li>
    <li> Very flimsy and do not stay in place.  Waste of money for me personally</li>
    <li> these bobby pins work but they are very cheap. what i mean by this is that they slant off easily and they open way too easily they are very weak but you get what you paid for i guess, i use them but will not be purchasing again</li>
    <li> Awesome bobby pins, awesome price.</li>
    <li> I always wear bobby pins  which means i ofteb lose them. I bought this pack thinking it would last a while but as I took them out of my hair , they would snag and hurt my scalp.. This resulted in me often pulling out pieces of my hair in order to get the pins out. These are very poorly made and I&#x27;ll be returning them soon. Not worth it</li>
    <li> I love having millions of bobby pins! I lose them often and very much wanted to have some around. I like that I received so many for the price listed, which is great deal. They are not the the best quality, and the bottom end piece can get a little pokey/sharp after a few uses, but given that I always lose them anyways, I do not have a problem throwing those out.

    <li> If you&#x27;re always losing bobby pins, this is a great buy. there are a ton of them and they&#x27;re already in a box!</li>
    <li> great deal plenty which will last u for long</li>
    <li> what can you say about bobby pins? k...they are awesome bobby pins. the 4 stars is because once you open the case it ain&#x27;t closin again.</li>
    <li> Love it. I bought this same item about 5 years ago, and just recently had to buy a new one. Ladies we lose bobby pins daily!</li>
    <li> The ones I received have different opening sizes (the distance between the two ends of the pin). Some are much to big. The quality isn&#x27;t great, but since there are so many, I only really wear them once and then throw them out. I won&#x27;t buy this kind again.</li>
    <li> These are bobby pins, what can I say. I have to say that some are not as well made as others, but for the price I am fine with throwing a few out. They do the trick and they were very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Not good. These are so loose they couldn&#x27;t hold a baby&#x27;s bangs before their first hair cut. After using one time, they lose their snap and are permanently &#x27;open&#x27; (see pic). Even prior to first use, they don&#x27;t have much holding power and quickly become unwanted ornaments in your hair. The package also makes for a pretty mediocre box, it can&#x27;t be closed once open so get ready to have your drawer shotgun blasted with these useless things. 500 of them.</li>
