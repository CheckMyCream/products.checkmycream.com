### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>However, this is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Best consistency of any foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>It matched my shade perfectly.</li>
      <li>Very good product, recommended 100 %.</li>
      <li>well it worked GREAT for me!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Without a doubt the best on point foundation of its kind.</li>
      <li>This foundation feels like nothing is there and gives great coverage.</li>
      <li>I was really happy with this foundation.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Still...not perfect as the fair isn&#x27;t entirely fair.</li>
      <li>The foundation is a pearly tone that Almay would have us believe magically morphs to blend perfectly with our coloring.</li>
      <li>It wouldn&#x27;t kill cosmetics manufacturers to use tubes, though, to be fair, I don&#x27;t know why this is still an issue in an age where we can hitch a satellite to a meteor, yet can&#x27;t get our foundation into a plastic tube.</li>
      <li>The light matches my skin tone perfect</li>
      <li>Your guess is as good as mine.</li>
      <li>It goes to show you ladies, you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot to get a good look.  </li>
      <li>How this is a good thing?</li>
      <li>Use a moisturizer and this and you should be as happy as i am :)</li>
      <li>It has a very nice texture, went on very smooth</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely glad I did!</li>
      <li>This makeup is amazing.</li>
      <li>just amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice try Almay.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It applies nicely w/ fingers, I think I preferred this to my brush.</li>
      <li>But all in all, this stuff is seriously amazing, and the price is way better on Amazon than anywhere I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
      <li>...looks flawless on my 51-year young skin.</li>
      <li>However, after a couple of months of consistent use I think this is one of the best light coverage makeups I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very light skinned</li>
      <li>I love it that it automatically knows what skin color I am.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It had a nice, velvety, but not quite matte, finish, and was comfortable on the skin, but I suspect over time it would not wear well on oily skin like mine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments.</li>
      <li>I love the coverage of this product.  </li>
      <li>better value than walmart.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Beautypedia recommends using a brush or sponge for the most hygienic application.</li>
      <li>I prefer this over the liquid version as I have more control.</li>
      <li>I just wish they had more product in the container.</li>
      <li>Love this makeup.</li>
      <li>This foundation goes on very smooth and is easy to blend in.</li>
      <li>The jar lasts for several months so it is a very good value as well.</li>
      <li>It is so lightweight and matte and most importantly DOES NOT BREAK ME OUT.</li>
      <li>Most liquid foundations do contain it, so I am always excited to find one that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>foundation goes on whiteish but easily blends to match my combination-to-oily skin.</li>
      <li>It was easy to work with and</li>
      <li>Light easy to apply .</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t ever stop making this fabulous product.</li>
      <li>I got the lightest shade, I used to wear BE Fairly Light to give you a reference point.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The mousse is light, does not look caked up, never smears or runs.</li>
      <li>I picked this up in Light.</li>
      <li>With that said, this foundation goes on incredibly smooth.</li>
      <li>This make up feels and goes on so light.</li>
      <li>It has a creamy, mousse-like texture, which allows me to start light and blend heavier where I need it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s advertised with Kate Hudson looking so smooth and glowing.  </li>
      <li>Almay went straight to the trash can!!!</li>
      <li>you, Amazon, for making it easier to afford high quality make up than blends with my light skin!:)</li>
      <li>Maybe best for normal to dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been a huge fan since I got my first bottle at Kmart a year ago (at $14.00!).</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s true color from you until you&#x27;ve shelled out your 12 dollars for it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a yellowy-tan to it when it warms up where I am forever wishing for that true cool porcelain color.</li>
      <li>Im full</li>
      <li>This by far is my favorite.</li>
      <li>as a plus, their products are cruelty free :) and to me, that is ESSENTIAL in purchasing my makeups.</li>
      <li>I liked this makeup a lot the only problem I have had with it is if you have dry skin at all you will be able to tell.</li>
      <li>and it definitely helped \\&quot;hydrate\\&quot; and make my skin glow more.</li>
      <li>it was my exact skin color,</li>
      <li>Have been using it since it first came out.</li>
      <li>The first time I put it on</li>
      <li>I just couldn&#x27;t believe I loved it more than the expensive IT brand.  </li>
      <li>I was worried about it oxidizing like the Almay Smart Shade AntiAging</li>
      <li>Blending is perhaps on the biggest tricks to learn as you will have to &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; the makeup to activate the smart shade.</li>
      <li>Blends grear and did match my &#x27;hard to match&#x27; fair skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Thanks for your business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When i 1st recieved &amp; opened it i was really worried.</li>
      <li>It really changes color fast and this protects the product still in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And it is so much cheaper on Amazon than at Walmart or a drug store.</li>
      <li>I think I applied too much and felt very dew-like all day.</li>
      <li>If its cakey then you&#x27;re putting too much on.</li>
      <li>Very greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>Once you master the application of this makeup it works very well as a covering foundation.</li>
      <li>I am a 20 year old female with mild acne, and I had been using Maybelling dream mousse make up because it gave me full coverage.</li>
      <li>For years ive had to special order makeup from back home, the shipping cost alone is 5Ã—</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all foundation between cover girl to bare minerals.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend you try it.</li>
      <li>It blends well and provides full coverage for long periods of time.  </li>
      <li>But why not try something new?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing new.</li>
      <li>I sound like a bitter old hag, it&#x27;s because</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It IS white at first, but the longer you blend with your fingers or sponge, it just disappears on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Color was too dark for my light skin</li>
      <li>I use my clean fingers and end up having slightly smelly product in the jar about halfway through.</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, the foundation doesn&#x27;t get so unhygienic that it causes a problem for my face.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this.  </li>
      <li>She told me the makeup looks so natural that she didn&#x27;t know I was wearing</li>
      <li>I do use the smart shade loose powder with it, too.</li>
      <li>It dosnt dry up skin or wear down quickly.</li>
      <li>Silky, not greasy and not dry.</li>
      <li>I was very skeptical at first but as soon as I put it on my skin I fell in love.</li>
      <li>Bare minerals didn&#x27;t have enough coverage for me.</li>
      <li>had  (oddly the regular Smart Shade doesn&#x27;t)</li>

    <li> better value than walmart.</li>
    <li> I got this on a whim because I&#x27;m such the makeup junkie.  It was also a few days after I received IT Cosmetics Celebration Foundation - well, I kept this, and returned the IT Cosmetics.  I love the coverage of this product.  I got the lightest shade, I used to wear BE Fairly Light to give you a reference point.  I just couldn&#x27;t believe I loved it more than the expensive IT brand.  It goes to show you ladies, you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot to get a good look.  BTW, I do like it with a primer...looks flawless on my 51-year young skin.</li>
    <li> Best consistency of any foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried. Silky, not greasy and not dry. Still...not perfect as the fair isn&#x27;t entirely fair. It&#x27;s got a yellowy-tan to it when it warms up where I am forever wishing for that true cool porcelain color.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with this foundation. I have very sensitive skin and it has red and rough patches (rosacea) it covered it all. It matched my shade perfectly. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing. I was worried about it oxidizing like the Almay Smart Shade AntiAging had  (oddly the regular Smart Shade doesn&#x27;t) but it didn&#x27;t. I just wish they had more product in the container.</li>
    <li> Blends grear and did match my &#x27;hard to match&#x27; fair skin. But it made my 52 year skin break out like a 13 year pimple-faced adolescent.  Very greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> This foundation goes on very smooth and is easy to blend in. Leaves a matte finish to your skin. I find it to be a little dry sometimes so I use moisturizer with this. The light matches my skin tone perfect</li>
    <li> Very good product, recommended 100 %.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt the best on point foundation of its kind. When i 1st recieved &amp; opened it i was really worried. It was paper white, it looked like lotion :-/ It has a very nice texture, went on very smooth like they say a dab will do ya. To my relief the second it hit my skin it was my exact skin color, just amazing. It dosnt dry up skin or wear down quickly. Im full Greek born &amp; raised there, its been almost impossible to find a match for my specific skin color. For years ive had to special order makeup from back home, the shipping cost alone is 5Ã— the cost of makeup in the states. Needless to say my prayers have been answered. I recommend to the world</li>
    <li> I use this makeup 5-6 times a week and apply it once in the morning. I bought this to replace my usual light-weight coverage makeup that was being discontinued. I was very hesitant to try this as I was afraid of looking washed out because of the smart shade technology and the mouse consistency. The first time I put it on I think I applied too much and felt very dew-like all day. However, after a couple of months of consistent use I think this is one of the best light coverage makeups I&#x27;ve used. I do use the smart shade loose powder with it, too. Blending is perhaps on the biggest tricks to learn as you will have to &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; the makeup to activate the smart shade. I usually create a small blobs in the center of my face and work out.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ever stop making this fabulous product. Light easy to apply . You don&#x27;t need allot and it lasts.</li>
    <li> I have been a huge fan since I got my first bottle at Kmart a year ago (at $14.00!). Not happy about the price. But why not try something new? I&#x27;m definitely glad I did! I&#x27;ve always had very light, oily skin, unfortunately, and every other liquid coverup I&#x27;ve used  had done nothing but make me break out and feel disgusting at the end of the day (like the True Blend from Covergirl - Yuk). Not anymore. This make up feels and goes on so light. You literally feel like you aren&#x27;t wearing any coverup. Now, I&#x27;ve seen in some other reviews that this makes your dry skin stick out. Of course, any coverup is going to highlight that. It&#x27;s nothing new. I&#x27;d suggest applying some hydrating lotion prior to the make up. But all in all, this stuff is seriously amazing, and the price is way better on Amazon than anywhere I&#x27;ve seen. Not to mention, one bottle lasts for months.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Amazon, for making it easier to afford high quality make up than blends with my light skin!:)</li>
    <li> This foundation elicited a compliment from my waxer when she cleaned my face and saw makeup on the cotton pad. She told me the makeup looks so natural that she didn&#x27;t know I was wearing any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation goes on whiteish but easily blends to match my combination-to-oily skin. It has a creamy, mousse-like texture, which allows me to start light and blend heavier where I need it. It&#x27;s not a full-coverage foundation but not sheer like tinted moisturizer. It has a matte finish that sometimes means I don&#x27;t need powder, and it never appears to settle or cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautypedia recommends using a brush or sponge for the most hygienic application. I agree but cannot get this to work with my foundation brush. I use my clean fingers and end up having slightly smelly product in the jar about halfway through. As far as I can tell, the foundation doesn&#x27;t get so unhygienic that it causes a problem for my face.</li>
    <li> This makeup is amazing. I was very skeptical at first but as soon as I put it on my skin I fell in love. It is so lightweight and matte and most importantly DOES NOT BREAK ME OUT. I am a 20 year old female with mild acne, and I had been using Maybelling dream mousse make up because it gave me full coverage. But it felt so heavy and oily and my face would look and feel gross at the end of the day. This foundation feels like nothing is there and gives great coverage. I will never use another foundation. And it is so much cheaper on Amazon than at Walmart or a drug store. Have not tried the powder with it yet but I plan on purchasing it ASAP!</li>
    <li> It blends well and provides full coverage for long periods of time.  I have dry spots so on my face so I still have some splotches.</li>
    <li> This makeup is not \\&quot;smart\\&quot; at all.  It goes on gooey and becomes cakey when it dries.  It&#x27;s advertised with Kate Hudson looking so smooth and glowing.  She wasn&#x27;t using this makeup.  Do not waste your money on this.  I threw mine in the trash.  I guess \\&quot;smart\\&quot; became dumb for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all foundation between cover girl to bare minerals. This by far is my favorite. I have sensitive skin and other foundations made my skin break out. Bare minerals didn&#x27;t have enough coverage for me. After I started using this Almay smartshade mousse I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments. I use a foundation brush or sponge to apply it. If its cakey then you&#x27;re putting too much on. A little goes a long way. I use Revlon photoready powder over it as well. I have to wash my face to get the makeup off at night. It stays on at least 12 hours and I don&#x27;t reapply. Not every foundation will work for everyone. However, this is the best I&#x27;ve used. I highly recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of reviews saying it didn&#x27;t work for them....well it worked GREAT for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very light skinned and it&#x27;s really hard for me to find foundations that work well for my pale-ness. I always end up looking orange or pink. With that said, this foundation goes on incredibly smooth. It IS white at first, but the longer you blend with your fingers or sponge, it just disappears on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally dry skin on my face and it definitely helped \\&quot;hydrate\\&quot; and make my skin glow more. It covered all of my trouble areas effortlessly. It mixes well with primers, sunblock, lotions, and BB cream as well as concealer sticks. I have been using this product for awhile and I am in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a plus, their products are cruelty free :) and to me, that is ESSENTIAL in purchasing my makeups.</li>
    <li> Works great. I love it that it automatically knows what skin color I am.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup. Have been using it since it first came out. I prefer this over the liquid version as I have more control. I do recommend using one of those tiny plastic paddles the makeup counter&#x27;s use so you don&#x27;t get skin oil in the makeup before you want to use it. It really changes color fast and this protects the product still in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mousse is light, does not look caked up, never smears or runs. It also allows me to use an oil in places where I have dryer skin without any differences in shading or coverage. The jar lasts for several months so it is a very good value as well.</li>
    <li> I got this because it does not contain cyclopentasiloxane, which I suspect breaks me out based on the checkered history we share. Most liquid foundations do contain it, so I am always excited to find one that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am NW15-ish, acne prone and oily. I picked this up in Light. The color on the jar is indicative of nothing. The foundation is a pearly tone that Almay would have us believe magically morphs to blend perfectly with our coloring. Nice try Almay. What this is, is a foundation that hides it&#x27;s true color from you until you&#x27;ve shelled out your 12 dollars for it. How this is a good thing? Your guess is as good as mine. Surprise!!!! Your foundation is dark. Thanks for your business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I sound like a bitter old hag, it&#x27;s because I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, though I&#x27;ve not worn it a full day due to the bad color match, I did experiment w/ it twice, and here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It applies nicely w/ fingers, I think I preferred this to my brush. It was easy to work with and blendable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had a nice, velvety, but not quite matte, finish, and was comfortable on the skin, but I suspect over time it would not wear well on oily skin like mine. Maybe best for normal to dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today&#x27;s germ-conscious ladies WILL NOT like the jar. Use a spatula or wash your hands, crybabies. What are you doing, lending your foundation to your dirty friends? Are you a member of some vast foundation exchange program? It wouldn&#x27;t kill cosmetics manufacturers to use tubes, though, to be fair, I don&#x27;t know why this is still an issue in an age where we can hitch a satellite to a meteor, yet can&#x27;t get our foundation into a plastic tube. Get your sh*t together, Almay.</li>
    <li> I liked this makeup a lot the only problem I have had with it is if you have dry skin at all you will be able to tell. Use a moisturizer and this and you should be as happy as i am :)</li>
    <li> Once you master the application of this makeup it works very well as a covering foundation. I used a different brand of mousse foundation before the Almay, but that brand discontinued its mousse makeup. The Almay works well once you get the hang of application.</li>
    <li> Color was too dark for my light skin eventhough I ordered the lightest shade. Plus also had a bad smell. In fact all the products that I ordered that were Almay went straight to the trash can!!! Never again!!</li>
