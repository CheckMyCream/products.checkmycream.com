      <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I love it because it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a pet groomer and with my hands being in water a good part of the day, during the winter months I really suffer.  </li>
      <li>Absorbs easily and lasts.</li>
      <li>This is hands down &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>Although supposed to be scent free, there is an undesirable scent to this.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and light.</li>
      <li>Truly fragrance free.</li>
      <li>Fortunately they ship in a freezer type bag.</li>
      <li>Yes, most of them moisturize at first...</li>
      <li>Lot&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon then at Fred Meyer where I bought it originally.</li>
      <li>NO MORE, this lotion is wonderful!  </li>
      <li>Feels great on my skin &amp; has helped with my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing which is most important.</li>
      <li>and it went on smoothly a bit too runny for my taste, but it penetrated my skin quickly</li>
      <li>Only thing is the smell isn&#x27;t all that pleasant</li>
      <li>I like this product but really like the ones they don&#x27;t make any more lavendar and mint</li>
      <li>Works very well, isn&#x27;t greasy,  I love it</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it and was so excited!</li>
      <li>I am so grateful that this product exists and am lucky to have had it recommended to me.</li>
      <li>its not greasy and absorbs quickly, its unscented and that is an added bonus.</li>
      <li>As a Diabetic I suffer with extremely dry skin and have tried many many products including prescriptions.  </li>
      <li>Also good for my hands when they&#x27;re dry!</li>
      <li>I have bought and tried many lotions for dry skin; so far this is the best I have found, especially for legs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and yet very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to consider what we put ON our bodies as much as we consider what we put IN them.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the  money.</li>
      <li>but I am used to not having nice scented lotions since there is no such thing for eczema sufferers.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>and it smells fresh.  </li>
      <li>Not to mention, the price is right--</li>
      <li>understand that different skins and different problems need different formulations of creams and lotions, so this may not be the best lotion for everybody, but it is certainly worth a try!</li>
      <li>She is very particular about what she uses and this met all her need!</li>
      <li>my legs looked okay and not dry.  </li>
      <li>So far so good, only applied once, but it seems to have an immediate effect.</li>
      <li>We have tried probably 20 scent-free and color-free lotions, and this is the only one that works fabulously!</li>
      <li>The fragrance is a bit offputting at first, but you get used to it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy and have not tried any other lotions since (except other products from ShiKai).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is the first moisturizer I have repurchased in years, if that&#x27;s any indicator.  </li>
      <li>This really works!</li>
      <li>The borage oil in it really helps my son&#x27;s skin!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also tried Amalactin regular formula and it didn&#x27;t work for me, it also has way too many chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great lotion on my dry hands and dry nails</li>
      <li>This lotion made the areas where I have the problems more dry, irritated,and itcy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This lotion is the greatest. Doesn&#x27;t  leave my skin feeling sticky. It&#x27;s  not heavy feeling.</li>
    <li> My son has chronic dry skin... When I can get him to use it... This is the only thing that keeps him from scratching skin from his dry itchy legs. It doesn&#x27;t last all day, so it it must be applied more than twice daily to get the benefit. Better value in this size too.</li>
    <li> I have bought and tried many lotions for dry skin; so far this is the best I have found, especially for legs.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body lotion. It&#x27;s light and yet very moisturizing. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion to mix essential oils with for arthritis pain and swelling. I will use it again!</li>
    <li> My husband has psoriasis. Even with treatment his skin has very dry patches and people sometimes stare at his hands and arms. ShiKai Borage penetrates and moisturizers better than any other lotion. His skin looks and feels so much better since he started using it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!!!  I live in Michigan and my skin was very dry and itchy this year.  I received this in the mail today and was so happy with it after just one use.  I always use lotion after I shower but it was so bad this winter with being so dry and itchy.  I used today and was not itchy at all.  This stuff was so amazing that the 1st thing I did when I came home from work was to write a review for this lotion.  So glad I found this product!!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom. She absolutely loves it and was so excited! She is very particular about what she uses and this met all her need!</li>
    <li> Great lotion on my dry hands and dry nails</li>
    <li> This product has improved the quality of my life immensely. I&#x27;ve been battling eczema and dry skin since I was a baby. In the 27 years of my life, I&#x27;ve tried every cream, ointment, and product under the sun to manage my eczema. All had strengths and flaws, but ultimately failed to do the job. Some creams would leave my skin dry while others would cause my skin to become hot and sticky. Nothing worked and I was at my wits end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I moved to Boston and had to find a new dermatologist. At his recommendation, I reluctantly tried Shikai Borage. Overnight, my life changed. Every time I use this product, my skin stops itching and the moisture of my skin is restored. It actually hydrates the skin! At the same time, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling mushy and hot. I now buy these things in bulk and place them around my house, so I always have some nearby to sooth my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last few years that I have used this product, my eczema has cleared up considerably. It has provided lasting healing. I am so grateful that this product exists and am lucky to have had it recommended to me. If I could give it ten stars out of five, I would!</li>
    <li> First of this lotion sucks big time.It says its unscented but to me it has a bad medicated smell to it.I brought this lotion thinking it was gonna solve my problems,but it just made them a WHOLE LOT WORST.Im suffering from bad eczema all over my legs and back I the cold weather its on its way not gonna make it any easier for me.This lotion made the areas where I have the problems more dry, irritated,and itcy.WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> This has been my go to lotion for several years now. It&#x27;s expensive, but I find I don&#x27;t need as much of it as other lotions.</li>
    <li> Love love love this lotion. Works great on my sons eczema.</li>
    <li> lotion bottle exploded in packaging!!!</li>
    <li> I had awful exzema and ive tried tons of different lotions. This is the only one that has worked for me, ive been using it for about a year and now my exzema is completley gone! its not greasy and absorbs quickly, its unscented and that is an added bonus. I love this lotion!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever encountered! It does not have any artificial fragrances, and really soothes irritated skin, it also really hydrates dry skin. I had a few terrible winters where my skin would get so dry and itchy, I tried many lotions and they would barely help or sometimes even make my skin itchier. Not ShiKai Borage, though! It soaks in and lasts quite a while, really does the job. I&#x27;m very happy and have not tried any other lotions since (except other products from ShiKai).&lt;br /&gt;I understand that different skins and different problems need different formulations of creams and lotions, so this may not be the best lotion for everybody, but it is certainly worth a try!</li>
    <li> my wife loves hand creams and tries them all---when this one came through the door i gave it a try. unbelievable, this actually does &#x27;something&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt; i have a problem with my legs, rough skin, flaking, etc. due to whatever, ( i won&#x27;t bore you). i applied to the areas early morning and the next day,  i had none of the above things i described.  since then i have been using this product every day and there has been an improvement.  i&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a cure all but i would recommend that you give it a try. a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Like most of you reading this review, I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of lotions for dry skin.  Yes, most of them moisturize at first...well obviously because we just lubricated our dry patches, but how many can say that it stays that way for the entire day?  And here I am about to try ANOTHER lotion for dry skin hoping that this one would actually keep scaly skin from looking ashy and dry.  I purchased not only this lotion, but also the ShiKai Borage for Children just to see if there was any difference.  The lotion is not very thick, the consistency is very runny, my first thought was that it wasn&#x27;t heavy enough to do the work.  I put some on both my scaly crocodile dry ass legs and it went on smoothly a bit too runny for my taste, but it penetrated my skin quickly, wasn&#x27;t sticky feeling.  I did this in the evening and figured it would probably get all rubbed off on my sheets and my legs would end up being the same.  In the morning I forgot about the lotion, but during the day, I noticed that my legs weren&#x27;t dry looking.  I&#x27;m not one to fuss too much about appearances and didn&#x27;t bother to lotion up the following evening, the next day I noticed my legs still didn&#x27;t look as scaly as it normally does.  Gosh...maybe it does work.  I skipped a few days and my legs started looking dry again so after showering I put on the lotion again.  For the next couple of days (I shower ever other day) my legs looked okay and not dry.  I tried the one for babies and it worked pretty much the same but I thought maybe it was a bit too gentle for my old dry legs.  I&#x27;ll stick with this adult version.  I am totally recommending this product.  I hope it works as well for you as it did me.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin &amp; has helped with my dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is hands down &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m a pet groomer and with my hands being in water a good part of the day, during the winter months I really suffer.  No matter what I used, or how often I applied, I could tell it was only doing a minimal job  NO MORE, this lotion is wonderful!  I apply three times daily and my hands remain soft throughout!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It moisterizes my skin without making it feel greasy. I received it in a timely manner and was as described.</li>
    <li> Great product and service!</li>
    <li> bought this for my sister, its all she will use</li>
    <li> Not only do I not have to worry about the ingredients, but it is great for everyday use. In the winter I just add a little Jojoba oil and it softens and moisturizers until the next morning. I can&#x27;t imagine ever using another product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic lotion for daughter who is allergic to many lotions.  We have tried probably 20 scent-free and color-free lotions, and this is the only one that works fabulously!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing which is most important. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. The smell bothers me a bit. For me the smell is not pleasant and it lingers ALL DAY. I think I may add an essential oil to this to help with the scent. I will buy again for the simple factor of moisture. I was using Aveeno or Gold Bond for moisture. Dry winter will be the true test of how the moisture holds up.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used for dry skin. Stays with you longer than any other lotion.The larger bottles are the best bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...I ordered 2 - one pump/cap was broken and leaking and the other was loose and leaking. Fortunately they ship in a freezer type bag. Went with 4 stars in an effort to get them to ship in bubble wrap or otherwise protect the container.</li>
    <li> So far it has relieved my itchy skin on my legs but it has this light horrible smell:( had to put lavender  Essential  oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to just apply it on the area needed not all your body</li>
    <li> This is the BEST moisturizer! Absorbs quickly relieving my VERY dry skin. Does not leave a sticky or oily film. It works better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
    <li> Does wonders for my skin with keratosis polaris</li>
    <li> Just moved to a drier climate in Colorado and it works wonderful... not greasy one bit...</li>
    <li> Great lotion, have used it for years and shipped with lightening speed! Not to mention, the price is right-- I was paying $15.99 for an 8 oz bottle before I found this little deal&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Big difference!</li>
    <li> Truly fragrance free. Absorbs easily and lasts. My husband and I have been using this for over 10 years I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product as far as I&#x27;m concerned! The fragrance is a bit offputting at first, but you get used to it. It healed a bad case of contact dermatitis on my hand that no other product was able to touch. Got a couple of these for my Mom and sister for Christmas!</li>
    <li> LOVE this lotion.  I have very dry skin and this is only product that lives up to my hopes.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. No petroleum or other b.s that you don&#x27;t want on your skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing.  I bought it to help with a rash that made my skin itchy and dry, but recently started using it on my face as the air is getting dry now.  It has done more in terms of &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; for my face than anything else I&#x27;ve ever purchased in only a few days, and I didn&#x27;t even think to try it on my face until recently.  It&#x27;s perfect for around your eye area, doesn&#x27;t sting or burn at all and has firmed my entire face, I have the skin I did years ago now!  I am buying the larger bottle today.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It does have a very strong borage oil smell, which for some might not be the most pleasant.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this stuff for his hands. Repeat customer.</li>
    <li> The lotion is watery and doesn&#x27;t work well. I also noticed that the bar code is covered with a white label. I wonder if it is a fake product. Will not buy again from this seller, Action Development Group. Extremely disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and have been using this for years. Works very well, isn&#x27;t greasy,  I love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else.  Wonderful on the skin.  I love it because it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
    <li> If you have very dry skin and eczema this is the best lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  It even works better if you use the undiluted hand cream (this is just a diluted version of the hand cream).  It even worked better than prescription Hylatopic Cream costing $227 a jar.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it would help if you have moist skin and get eczema.  You might want to try the oatmeal lotions/creams if your skin isn&#x27;t very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I suspect the studies saying Borage doesn&#x27;t help eczema were for oral supplements and probably done in higher humidity parts of the world because this stuff works extremely well in the desert.</li>
    <li> The borage oil&#x27;s GLA is a wonder for the skin and instead of all that chemically prescription crap doc&#x27;s tend to give out, this one would actually do something about both reversing dry skin and helping eczema.</li>
    <li> As a Diabetic I suffer with extremely dry skin and have tried many many products including prescriptions.  This is the best of them all. Thrilled to have found it.</li>
    <li> Great value in this large container.  I have to live with eczema, I also use prescription clobetasol propionate.  The combination helps hold the cracking in my fingers to a minimum.  The eczema will clear up and when I work with my hands it will flair up again.  This my &amp;#34;go to product&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion that helps me endure my eczema flare ups.  It makes my skin feel like silk. Definitely worth the  money.</li>
    <li> As a nurse I am washing my hands on average every three to five minutes. Try as they may to moisturize the commercial hospital soaps destroy your skin. My hands were so severely dry they were not only red, dry, cracked and bleeding but they were also swollen and painful which made it nearly impossible to type or hold on to a pen and write. I found a small travel size tube of this product at a local Natural Living Center for $2.35, I had tried over a dozen other products (including coconut and olive oil as well as lard and beeswax) without success. I keep the travel tube in my scrubs pocket and the very first night of use (roughly 4 applications) my hands had almost returned to normal. Two days after purchasing the travel tube, I returned to the store and purchased two large tubes. I would and have absolutely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have eczema.  Since I have been using this lotion (I apply it daily as a body lotion after showering), I haven&#x27;t had a single episode of cracked bleeding sores that refuse to heal (previously about six or eight times/year).  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten rid of all other skin creams and only use the borage products. I live in a sunny very hot climate and these products seem to help my skin heal from the harsh sun exposure.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for 5 years now.  I used to buy Jergen&#x27;s or something similar that you can get at Walmart until I found this at Whole Foods.  I haven&#x27;t stopped using the product.  Since I live in Nevada, the air is so dry here - however, using this product has made my skin silky soft.  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It is scentless and thick and has helped to keep my skin in great condition during the dry cold New England winters. It feels like it really sinks in because I never get dry patches of skin or itchy. I especially love it because I have very sensitive skin and it is never a problem, which is incredible!</li>
    <li> Great product! Worth every penny!! This really works!</li>
    <li> Good product! The borage oil in it really helps my son&#x27;s skin! Also good for my hands when they&#x27;re dry!</li>
    <li> Being full of natural ingredients, I have gotten a bottle that smelled a little rancid, like yogurt that is a day or two past its prime.  Fortunately, with Amazon&#x27;s great customer service, I got a replacement bottle and all is right with the world.  Long story short, I have sensitive skin that is very picky.  I use this stuff to moisturize my face (both at night, and in the morning on top of my aftershave) and my body, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The dual-purpose use definitely helps cut down on my dopp kit when traveling.  This is the first moisturizer I have repurchased in years, if that&#x27;s any indicator.  If you have picky skin and/or are looking to lighten your load when traveling, pick up a bottle.</li>
    <li> Pretty good but not a cure all for my eczema... Only thing is the smell isn&#x27;t all that pleasant but I am used to not having nice scented lotions since there is no such thing for eczema sufferers. And its a little pricey but I will continue my search and might be back to buy again.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff!  Great moisturizer and it smells fresh.  Next time I will be buying the large size!  I am so thankful I could order it through Amazon!  I have been looking for it ever since a friend gave me a bottle.</li>
    <li> Been using for years. Works really well. Winter times are the worst for my hand where they crack and bleed. I also work in a care facility where i&#x27;m constantly washing my hands.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I used this on myself and my son who both have KP. This has gotten rid of most of the KP on my son (still a little on his upper arms) and all of the bumps on me (although the red dots are still there). My skin actually has an ahhh sensation when I put this lotion on.</li>
    <li> My skin&#x27;s appearance has literally already improved with a silky and soft condition.</li>
    <li> I suffer with extremely dry skin that gets raw and itchy. I&#x27;ve tried everything!  This lotion is the only thing that has ever worked! Worth every penny. Lot&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon then at Fred Meyer where I bought it originally.</li>
    <li> I like this product but really like the ones they don&#x27;t make any more lavendar and mint</li>
    <li> My all time favorite lotion - stops my hands from cracking in the winter, absorbs well, and has no fragrance added (I&#x27;m allergic to fragrances, so this matters quite a lot).</li>
    <li> Although supposed to be scent free, there is an undesirable scent to this.  It&#x27;s a decent moisturizer but the smell is offensive to my husband.  He smelled it when I went to bed at night and thought it was gross!</li>
    <li> Treats skin well but the scent is unpleasant.</li>
    <li> great unsented lotion</li>
    <li> So far so good, only applied once, but it seems to have an immediate effect. Will continue to use. Yes.</li>
    <li> The contents were very watery.  It was not like the other Borage lotions I have used.  I didn&#x27;t know how to send it back without it leaking.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best I have tried in a long time.  I will definitely order it again.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but it&#x27;s not thick enough to use overnight on my hands.  Unfortunate because it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> Ordered this over and over. Just the best for a non scented moisturizer that gets the itch, and cools your skin. Great product!  Wish it was local.</li>
    <li> I like it.  But, it&#x27;s better (for me) when I add a bit of avocado oil.  I do like the ingredients.  It&#x27;s important to consider what we put ON our bodies as much as we consider what we put IN them.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It&#x27;s not greasy and light.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used ShiKai Borage Formula Lotion for almost 9 years. It&#x27;s so comfortable and helps me with my dry skin. I&#x27;ve tried them all, but only ShiKai works.</li>
    <li> This has worked better for my extremely dry, eczema prone, bumpy, Keratosis Pilaris skin condition, than any other product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was prescribed a very expensive foam for the KP but it only promoted eczema breakouts without doing anything for my KP. I&#x27;ve tried Ultra Repair lotion from Sephora which did improve the dryness a very little bit but didn&#x27;t handle the KP or eczema. I&#x27;ve also tried Amalactin regular formula and it didn&#x27;t work for me, it also has way too many chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cousin recommended Shikai&#x27;s products so I gave it a try. I noticed a difference right away, the KP on my upper arms and thighs is completely gone. It took less than two weeks for the bumps to disappear and for a fraction of the cost. Thank god there&#x27;s an affordable solution! Thank you Shikai!!!</li>
    <li> With so many chemical based lotions out there it is nice to find one that is actually good for you.  Love the product and have given many away to others who are hooked.  It is expensive for lotions but worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin moisturizing lotion for me as it goes on easy without feeling oily or greasy and my skin has not felt dry all winter  (that is Northeast USA winters) long. Just purchased my second bottle...</li>
