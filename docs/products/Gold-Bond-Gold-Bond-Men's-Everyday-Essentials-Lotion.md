<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps my face hydrated and applies nice and thick like a good hand cream. The scent is pleasant and more of a masculine smell than other lotions I have used. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s non-greasy with a light scent. I mostly use it on my face after shaving so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This lotion is pretty sweet. I have used a few and this one seems to do the job without feeling greasy or being too fragrant. It is also a great buy for the size and the quality. I am a converted gold bond fan! Who needs the crazy expensive stuff when this is just as good.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and more! Not only does it make your face/skin feel soft and smooth it also smells amazing. Great long-lasting moisturizer. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Been using this lotion for about a week. I work at a Humane Society and wash my hands about 50 times a day, and being in Iowa, my hands crack and get very rough in the winter! Now, they feel like a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
    <li> I definitely like this &amp;#34;stuff.&amp;#34; It has a nice scent, not too flowery .... fittingly for men, it is more masculine. The lotion is pretty thick but&lt;br /&gt;goes on well ... wherever you might want to put it: face, hands, neck, body, etc.</li>
    <li> I have big one at home this one is for my car</li>
    <li> I decided to try Gold Bond brand skin product targeted for men. I like it to keep my hands nice and looking their (skin) best. Glad i did very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond Men&#x27;s Everyday Essentials Cream, 6.5....works well on my old cracked hands, an ample supply and an ok fragrance, will buy another tube for work</li>
    <li> Very little smell, not greasy. I am 74 and since i started using it every morning everyone says I look to be in my 30&#x27;s. of course, they are in their 80&#x27;s and don&#x27;t see so good...:-)</li>
    <li> Bought this in store, not from Amazon. I Like it so much I felt compelled to tell others a out this product. From the moment I put this on I could tell a difference. I suffer every winter from super dry, itchy skin. I first put this on my hands and was amazed at how quickly it penetrated and just how long it lasted. It&#x27;s almost as if in one application of it cured all my cracking and dryness. I then did a whole body rubdown and it has worked just as well. I&#x27;ve never had such good success with any other product! And I&#x27;ve wasted money on plenty.....Shoot-Now guess I ought to try it on my face. I could stand to look a few years off my age too! My wife loves the smell of this lotion too-She says it&#x27;s masculine but not overly done. Sexy.....</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer for the male of the species. Neutral scent. Seems to moisturize and make skin healthier. But, I still like the Gold Bond Extra Strength for everyday use especially for healing really dry skin and relieving itching.</li>
    <li> I recently discovered the Gold Bond series of hand creams and have grown to really like them.  They absorb quickly and don&#x27;t make my hand feel greasy at all.  I dislike the feeling from most other creams and lotions that leaves me not wanting to pick things up or just plain touch anything so I don&#x27;t leave grease spots.  Not the case with these Gold Bond Daily Essentials Creams.  I also enjoy that my hands feel moisturized even after handwashing.</li>
    <li> better product overall.  has a great scent to it, reminds me of the scent at the w and westin hotels.  purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This is the best daily lotion I&#x27;ve used. I get some acne from time to time, so I can&#x27;t use anything heavy. I can use this on my face, neck, shoulders, arms etc., and it never makes me break out. I use Neutrogena Post-Shave potion after I shave, and then this for the next day or two. Helps keep things clear &amp; happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mild, and doesn&#x27;t smell like cheap cologne. I just hope Gold Bond never discontinues it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. He likes using moisturizers at night, and this is working great on his skin. The scent isn&#x27;t loud at all but just enough manliness. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Fantastic face moisturizer</li>
    <li> Scent is off-putting for me and too strong. Sister doesn&#x27;t like it either for whatever that&#x27;s worth. As a lotion, seems to be good. No complaints there. I&#x27;ll probably use the tube, but won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Use in the winter time because my skin cracks and bleeds on my hands. I use this before bed and after the shower in the mornings. It helped tremendously and it doesn&#x27;t smell horrible or leave that oily feeling on your hands.</li>
    <li> Good quality product that lasts for hours.  It does not have a strong odor, just about right.  Plan to buy this again.</li>
    <li> I hate lotion but my hands have been cracking lately so I had to try something. I ordered this, it works, but it&#x27;ll leave your hands feeling greasy until you wash them. I typically use it before I go to bed and my hands will still be a little slimy from the lotion when I wake up. But...My hands are no longer cracking so your call.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations, received it within days - easier tan trying to fid this at a retail location - would recommend</li>
    <li> Good. But I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Dry seasons here in the Midwest can be brutal and lotion is a must, this one however is not as great as Shaq makes it seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find an all natural lotion product by the Honest company and have been amazed how great it is.  Fast drying, non greasy, and no girly smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to save a few bucks here&#x27;s a link for a free sample set and a $10 coupon: http://goo.gl/9XL6ZI</li>
    <li> I get dry cracked hands sitting in the Arizona air conditioning all day long. This helps smooth out the cracks and makes them feel better without making me smell like a melon.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hands moisturized. Doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all. The scent is good, not overpowering at all like the Vaseline men. Smells stronger out of the tube but once it on, it&#x27;s pretty light.&lt;br /&gt;It says \\&quot;15sec absorption\\&quot;, its true :-)</li>
    <li> i recomended to all the mens out their , its a great product</li>
    <li> This cream is non greasy, moiturizing and fast absorbing, but the scent is overpowering. Otherwise I would give it 4-5 stars.</li>
    <li> I got this when it was on sale and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It works very well on my face after I have a shave/shower.  Once I put it on, I do not have to put it on again that day.  Also works well when you listen to the wife and do a little shaving in &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; areas then get a killer razor burn rash that makes you want to jump off a cliff.  But I wouldn&#x27;t know about that.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my dry skin son. He love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what men&#x27;s lotion should be, non-greasy, good masculine scent, and keeps your skin feeling fresh.  The sweet masculine design and branding is included in the price of your lotion, but I&#x27;m willing to pay a little more for a great product that has great branding and just flat out looks cool.</li>
    <li> This Gold Bond cream is good for sensitive skin..purchased as a gift with good reviews..fresh scent..will purchase again as great value..</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  Fast absorbing, very light pleasant fragrance and most importantly, keeps my skin from drying out in the winter!</li>
    <li> Does not go on greasy or slimy melts right in, the smell is ok nothing loud or offensive. It does not last 24 hrs I usually have to re-apply half way through the day. Over all not bad I would buy again thanks.</li>
    <li> This product is great. There is no nasty film left over. Once it dries your skin stays moist but feels normal, not like you have lotion on. It lasts almost all day, so I sometimes put a little at work. Does not smell like petunias. The sent is meant for MEN but it is not over the top. Great product.</li>
    <li> Light texture that leaves a soft barrier and absorbs right away. Soft and light men&#x27;s scent but not overpowering. Great soft skin.</li>
    <li> The product does exactly as advertised.  It works</li>
    <li> Not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out. Has a very manly smell like sandalwood or some similar scent.</li>
    <li> Great smell, not greasy, absorbs quickly.  I use this cream as an aftershave in the winter.  It works well for both hands and face.  Price is good also.</li>
    <li> Love the product!!! Only problem was when it arrived the top was broken and lotion was all over the inside of the bag☹️</li>
    <li> My husband had used multiple products, but this seemed to clear up his dry hands which started witht he rought winter we had.</li>
    <li> It works really well its helped clear up the dry and redness on face and arms i would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have used many good moisturizers over the years, but found this Gold Bond product to be perfect for many of my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it can be used on the face, body or hands, it is nice to have ONE product that does it all. Saves money from not having to buy multiple moisturizers, to be sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get real bad dryness and scaling under my nose area when I don&#x27;t shave every day. I also recently noticed a very dry and rough area on one of my elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product with mild expectations. I have used Gold Bond foot creams in the past and they worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product cleared up my elbow dryness almost immediately and has kept the problem under control for the past week. It also does a great job with the scaling on my face for days when I don&#x27;t want to shave. Finally, it does a great job keeping the hands smooth, thus keeping me from picking dry skin off near my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on this product for life and just hope Gold Bond doesn&#x27;t discontinue it anytime soon!</li>
    <li> As a swimmer, I am always looking for a great moisturizing lotion to get the chlorine out and restore my skin. This product is great and is all I will buy now. It has a good, masculine scent (not overwhelming), absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t come in a bottle I would be ashamed of lugging into the gym with me. It screams manly and I always feel great after applying it. A breath of fresh air for sure!</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Can double as a unisex-scented lotion.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ive ever used, smells great!</li>
    <li> Just a cream, what can I say. Working well, for hands or face.</li>
    <li> cheaper than the store and amazon prime ships it for free. I keep some by the bed and the TV room and in my truck for when i feek dry or itchy, smells good too</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion to throw into my gym bag. I need to moisturize after showering after swimming. This does cost a little bit more per ounce than the regular pump version of the lotion, however if you&#x27;re deciding between the two, just go with the pump. I plan on reusing the tube and refilling it with the lotion from the pump so that&#x27;s really the only reason why I purchased it. I suppose buying an empty tube and filling it with my lotion would suffice, but I just went ahead and bought this.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, quick apsorbtion.  Has a nice smell, almost like a cologne, but not overpowering. Will buy again, and I recommend anyone give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting old so it&#x27;s a good idea to use good product.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely amazing hand/body lotion for men. It is the ONLY type of lotion that I now use. What I love most about this cream is how quickly it dries upon application. I believe the packaging says that it dries in 15 seconds, and that is definitely very true when it comes to this product. As a result, you don&#x27;t get a greasy/oily/shiny feel on your skin and you get more of a natural feeling as if nothing was applied, but of course your skin is now hydrated and feeling great. I typically apply this once a day, and I find that it does last all day long (12+ hours), so you don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplication, but you could do so if you felt that your skin is feeling a little extra dry that day or something. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this specific product for extremely dry skin or severe eczema-related problems, as there are stronger creams out there and even ones that are medicated for that purpose, but this is definitely great for everyday use for normal to somewhat dry skin that just needs some hydration back. So far, I haven&#x27;t found any cons for this cream.</li>
    <li> First the good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to like the brand. It is an excellent moisturizer with good color and consistency. It is non-greasy once it has been absorbed and the absorbtion happens quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The less good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor is not strong but what odor there is, is funky. There are so many chemicals listed on the side that I have to think they cannot all be desirable to come in contact with. I also notice a little bit of the alcohol burning feeling while I apply it.</li>
    <li> feels like some expensive stuff i got as a gift and works just as well.  i use it as aftershave.  smell is OK, a bit strong for me but not bad.</li>
    <li> This is good. I carry this one in my car for emercencies.  Great for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product for daily use.  If I have a tough patch of dry skin I use the one in the white tube -- I think it is called triple action or something to that effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different lotions and have finally settled on this brand.  It&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t feel slimy.  It doesn&#x27;t take five minutes to finally get rid of the slippery feeling.  It dries quick (probably from the alcohol) but it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, if that makes sense.  I&#x27;ve noticed the lotions with lots of alcohol in them dried quick but also kind of dried my skin out a little.</li>
    <li> gold bond makes 2 types of moisturizers: creams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the creams are generally thicker, more concentrated, and more expensive than the lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;comparing this to the other gold bond creams is a little disappointing.. it&#x27;s much much thinner.&lt;br /&gt;the thickest GB moisturizer I&#x27;ve used is the &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; cream.&lt;br /&gt;the thinnest is probably a tie between this mens lotion and the &amp;#34;daily moisturizing&amp;#34; lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this moisturizer and may continue to use it. it&#x27;s a good product.  but I was expecting this to be much thicker, similar to the &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; cream.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond is long lasting and works very well. I would recommend this size as a travel size. I keep one of these in my car, while I use the 14.5 ounce size at home.</li>
    <li> Best men&#x27;s lotion period!  I&#x27;ve been a competitive swimmer since 1971 and this is by far the best lotion I have used.  No smells, great medium consistency and rubs in quickly.  Everyone who has borrowed some had switched.  Highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son.  He&#x27;s very fussy about creams.  Doesn&#x27;t like anything &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;perfumery&amp;#34;.  This is the first cream he actually &amp;#34;likes&amp;#34;.  He says there is no greasy feeling after putting it on and it doesn&#x27;t wash away easily.  He washes his hands at work a lot.  This time of year is tough on hands and this cream helps.  I&#x27;m not sure how it smells but it can&#x27;t be bad or too strong because he&#x27;s still using it.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond is very good cream!</li>
    <li> I hate hand lotion, mostly because of the oily/lubricating feeling most lotions leave behind. This one doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve been working as a barista for the past two years, and the coffee ingrained in my palms could give you a caffeine buzz through a handshake. Lotion has become a requirement, and it&#x27;s wonderful to have one that replenishes the healthiness of my skin without feeling like I dipped my arms in wax. Graphic design is pretty on point too regardless of how relevant it is to the user.</li>
    <li> My shins and my waist area get so dry during the winter months. I have been looking for the right remedy. Something that doesn&#x27;t stink and that isn&#x27;t greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I got a little sample of this lotion a in a goodie bag from a bicycle ride back in the spring. At the time I didn&#x27;t need any  lotion so I tossed it in my bag and forgot about it.&lt;br /&gt;Come the middle of winter and I am scratching the heck out of my skin to the point of drawing blood. I happened to find the sample of this lotion in my bag. Lets just say I am very glad I found it. It soothed and moistened my dry skin very well. The super dry skin condition disappeared in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and the cream absorbs into my skin without an oily mess.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a tube of this lotion as soon as I saw the results of using it.</li>
    <li> Will continue to order...daily use...!</li>
    <li> One of the few face moisturizers that stops the dry skin flaking and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I have very sensitive skin (rosacea and dermatitis) and this works very well.  Quick absorption.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, I don&#x27;t say that about very many things. Although it&#x27;s very expensive</li>
    <li> I received a 3/4 oz. free sample with an order from another company. I liked it, and my brother also liked it, so I ordered a larger tube from Amazon. Make that two tubes, so my brother has one and leaves mine alone. Not much odor, and it really works! I mean, after getting brake cleaner all over your hands it works.</li>
    <li> Holding up for a long time had the same bottle for about 3 months, not overly scented or sticky.</li>
    <li> Great for those of us that work out. Does its job and is great on the skin with scent. Great</li>
    <li> Best lotion on the market for winter dry skin!!! Love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I really like the subtle fresh fragrance and how it moisturizes my face.</li>
    <li> Great quality product! Very happy with it!</li>
