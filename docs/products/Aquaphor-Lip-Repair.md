      <li>Good Stuff.</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>otherwise it is good</li>
      <li>Not as good as overnight chapstick but does an alright job</li>
      <li>Good results.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff !</li>
      <li>Aquaphor makes amazing products.</li>
      <li>Nice prooduct for chapped lips</li>
      <li>not as cost effective as others.....</li>
      <li>Really nice...</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>The product is an outstanding lip balm.</li>
      <li>does the job and LOVE the point tip applicator.....</li>
      <li>I layer a tinted lipstick over it when I want more color on my lips.</li>
      <li>I bought this based on the excellent reviews thinking it was going to be the last lip product I&#x27;d ever need...</li>
      <li>Better than chapstick, but give me Carmex.</li>
      <li>I read about the Aquaphor in Paula Begoun&#x27;s Beautypedia (an amazing free resource), and am so glad that I tried it.</li>
      <li>Seems pretty good.  </li>
      <li>the best for your lips even use on your elbows at night to soften those dry areas</li>
      <li>The tubes make it easy to carry along wherever I go.</li>
      <li>I use it before bed and my lips stay moist and comfortable all night.</li>
      <li>Enjoy them cause they both are # 1 .</li>
      <li>This is a good product if there was only  a way it could remain on your lips longer.  </li>
      <li>I really like the shaped applicator - easy to apply &amp; precise.</li>
      <li>Got this for my lips, which were super chapped and peeling.  </li>
      <li>Feels good on lips, but does stay on long.</li>
      <li>This little tube is great to carry around in your purse.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this even though kind of spendy for a tiny tube</li>
      <li>But even when my lips are super chapped and peeling, Aquaphor is able to sink in and really moisturise my lips, whereas other products are just sitting on top</li>
      <li>This cleared my lips up super fast.</li>
      <li>Perfect for dry winter lips without making my lips a slippery mess you can really feel the moisture being absorbed by your lips rather than just sitting on the surface</li>
      <li>Worth the price &amp; fast shipping.</li>
      <li>and now I use it about twice a day and am able to control the dryness that causes chapped lips especially in the winter time.</li>
      <li>only product that repairs and keeps them healthy is Aquaphor.  </li>
      <li>check the net for a better deal........</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ve used pretty much every brand of lip balm known to man, from bonnie bell to blistex to EOS to Carmex to Burt&#x27;s Bees to you-name-it.</li>
      <li>However it is is more than protection, it does treat, seem to heal quickly, dry cracked lips.</li>
      <li>and I love it so much that I use it every single day in my life at school.</li>
      <li>not just for the first 5 minutes like most other products.</li>
      <li>I keep it on my nightstand and put it on at night before sleeping and my lips are so much softer.</li>
      <li>and it really works.  </li>
      <li>and I can really tell a difference in the morning when I use it the night before.</li>
      <li>I much rather prefer the stick tubes for lip balm.</li>
      <li>It works quite well and doesn&#x27;t have any real flavor or scent.</li>
      <li>But it works really well</li>
      <li>Most lip gloss and other lip stuff makes my lips swell and peel.</li>
      <li>My only gripe is it&#x27;s non-SPF, but I suspect it would significantly change the formula and the texture if SPF ingredients were included, so what can you do.</li>
      <li>I bought four more to keep them in various places around the house/in my purse, and am using only these now.</li>
      <li>This lip treatment is more expensive than most.</li>
      <li>Fabulous product for dry lips!</li>
      <li>But this product moisturizes my lips better than Burt&#x27;s Bees, however, it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>great for when you have a cold</li>
      <li>but results are soft lips in the am after pm application.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, I will say that I really do not like the tube applicator.</li>
      <li>This product REALLY does help and heal  dry lips....</li>
      <li>It was okay, but not great.</li>
      <li>When I complained about dry lips many years ago, my doctor directed me to this product.  </li>
      <li>However, after a while you will most likely have hard little caked bits on your lips (like any chapstick).</li>

<li> /&gt;To be used when you have very dry lips because of use Roaccutane!</li>

<li> I was having a strange problem with burning lips (felt like a constant bad sunburn) and all of my lip balms (I had several different brands) were making the burning sensation worse.</li>
<li> I walk about 15 minutes to work everyday.  </li>
<li> Goes on very thin and requires frequent reapplication.</li>

<li> There is no better no where .</li>
<li> If you havent tried this you are missing out!&lt;br /&gt;Great for a stocking stuffer too!</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not effective.</li>
<li> thick like honey or something.</li>
<li> Burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s is quite thick and tends to cake on after a while</li>
<li> I use it at night, find it a bit too thick for use during the day.  </li>

    <li> The product is an outstanding lip balm. I was having a strange problem with burning lips (felt like a constant bad sunburn) and all of my lip balms (I had several different brands) were making the burning sensation worse. I dug out an old Aquaphor that I had and it seemed to sooth my lips a little bit. I bought four more to keep them in various places around the house/in my purse, and am using only these now. My lip problem has cleared up, but I am afraid of going back to my old lip balms. I will keep using Aquaphor.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this even though kind of spendy for a tiny tube but it&#x27;s not effective. My lips are still dry and not sure what to try next.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve used pretty much every brand of lip balm known to man, from bonnie bell to blistex to EOS to Carmex to Burt&#x27;s Bees to you-name-it. I read about the Aquaphor in Paula Begoun&#x27;s Beautypedia (an amazing free resource), and am so glad that I tried it. It&#x27;s silky and smooths even my rough, flaky lips without emphasizing the flakes or feeling oily or sticky.

    <li> Best lip balm I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;To be used when you have very dry lips because of use Roaccutane!</li>
    <li> thick like honey or something. Didn&#x27;t like it at all. Will stick to baby lips. Only keep this in my bag in case I don&#x27;t have any lotion, I&#x27;ll apply it to an ashy spot on my hands since it&#x27;s thick enough.</li>
    <li> It is awesome and I love it so much that I use it every single day in my life at school.</li>
    <li> This lip treatment is more expensive than most. However it is is more than protection, it does treat, seem to heal quickly, dry cracked lips.</li>
    <li> With this horrific winter we have all had, this product has been a Godsend.  Thank you, Amazon.  This cleared my lips up super fast.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how this Aquaphor differs from regular, if at all, but the way it is packaged makes it convenient for locker room, purse, travel, etc. Good Stuff.</li>
    <li> Aqua photo beats any other balm  the best for your lips even use on your elbows at night to soften those dry areas</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I will say that I really do not like the tube applicator. I much rather prefer the stick tubes for lip balm. But this product moisturizes my lips better than Burt&#x27;s Bees, however, it doesn&#x27;t last as long. Burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s is quite thick and tends to cake on after a while, this is greasier and less prone to caking. However, after a while you will most likely have hard little caked bits on your lips (like any chapstick). It works quite well and doesn&#x27;t have any real flavor or scent. I&#x27;d recommend this, but I haven&#x27;t tried other medicated lip balms other than this.</li>
    <li> My son uses this for his lips as they are really dry from medication he was on.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product that worked for him...</li>
    <li> I was somewhat skeptical that this product would work considering that it looks somewhat like Vaseline. But even when my lips are super chapped and peeling, Aquaphor is able to sink in and really moisturise my lips, whereas other products are just sitting on top my flaky lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
    <li> this is a great product. keeps your lips moist and hydrated. great for when you have a cold and you dont want to wear lipstick or gloss.</li>
    <li> This is the best balm that  I&#x27;ve experienced.  I now purchase on a repeat basis.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. Aquaphor makes amazing products. If you havent tried this you are missing out!&lt;br /&gt;Great for a stocking stuffer too!</li>
    <li> my lips are chronically chapped.  This is the only thing I&#x27;ve found to relieve them.  I&#x27;m kind of shocked.  I keep it on my nightstand and put it on at night before sleeping and my lips are so much softer.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I try this and it really works.  My lips get chapped in the winter and nothing seemed to help until I tried this.  I always keep some in the house and in my purse.</li>
    <li> I walk about 15 minutes to work everyday.  During the winter time my lips take a beating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product that repairs and keeps them healthy is Aquaphor.  Everything else is just a gimmick.</li>
    <li> Got this for my lips, which were super chapped and peeling.  I use it at night, find it a bit too thick for use during the day.  But it works really well and I can really tell a difference in the morning when I use it the night before.</li>
    <li> Better than chapstick, but give me Carmex. Feels like it needs reapplied often.</li>
    <li> I used to only use chapsticks and constantly needs to use it in winter to take care of chapped lips.  Then I came across Aquaphor and now I use it about twice a day and am able to control the dryness that causes chapped lips especially in the winter time.</li>
    <li> Seems pretty good.  I use it before bed and my lips stay moist and comfortable all night.</li>
    <li> Not as good as overnight chapstick but does an alright job</li>
    <li> Feels good on lips, but does stay on long.</li>
    <li> We use aquaphor for all kinds of things: chapped lips, chapped hands, diaper rash. . . . This little tube is great to carry around in your purse.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry winter lips without making my lips a slippery mess you can really feel the moisture being absorbed by your lips rather than just sitting on the surface</li>
    <li> Use daily as a lip gloss/moisturizer. It keeps your lips moisturized but the best part is that it&#x27;s not sticky! Your hair will never get stuck in this lip gloss. I layer a tinted lipstick over it when I want more color on my lips.</li>
    <li> Nice prooduct for chapped lips</li>
    <li> It was okay, but not great. My lips were still chapped after several uses. Not a match for Montana cold.</li>
    <li> Really nice...does the job and LOVE the point tip applicator.....not as cost effective as others.....but results are soft lips in the am after pm application. check the net for a better deal........</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best along with Nivea . They both are very good &amp; help alot . There is no better no where . Chapstick,Blistex, none even come close at all . Try &amp; you will see what i say is correct . Enjoy them cause they both are # 1 .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it 10 stars if I can. The best lip balm ever. I am allergic to almost every lip product, including Kiehl&#x27;s LIP BALM #1. But this one is just great, and even cheaper. I am gonna keep using it.</li>
    <li> This product REALLY does help and heal  dry lips....not just for the first 5 minutes like most other products. Great Product!!</li>
    <li> Chapped lips have always been a problem and this product helps with that and instantly like it says on the tube.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Good results.  I&#x27;ve been using it for roughly over a month and I am happy with how well it works.</li>
    <li> When I complained about dry lips many years ago, my doctor directed me to this product.  The tubes make it easy to carry along wherever I go.</li>
    <li> I didnt order my aquaphor from here, i usually get it at walmart. I have very sensitive skin. Most lip gloss and other lip stuff makes my lips swell and peel. I&#x27;ve been using aquaphor for almost three years now. It&#x27;s the only thing that dosent break my lips out. I love this stuff !</li>
    <li> Fabulous product for dry lips!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the excellent reviews thinking it was going to be the last lip product I&#x27;d ever need... WRONG. Can&#x27;t figure out what the big deal is all about. Goes on very thin and requires frequent reapplication. Does not hold up well to food or drink. After using for a week+ there is no improvement. Got much better results from thicker, less expensive lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product I&#x27;ve used is Lypsyl, just very difficult to find in my area.</li>
