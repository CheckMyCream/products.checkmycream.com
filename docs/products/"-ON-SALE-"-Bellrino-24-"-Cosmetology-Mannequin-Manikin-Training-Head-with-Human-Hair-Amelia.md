      <li>Great product that I would recommend to all little girls!</li>

      <li>Thought we found a real deal for a manniquin head for cosmetalogy school.  </li>
      <li>More than half of her hair fell out and she lost 3 inch just from brushing.</li>
      <li>she really loves it to practice doing different hair styles on.  </li>
      <li>Reminds me of the old Barbie doll horses that had unmanageable hair.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for one of my granddaughters 10 years old.</li>
      <li>Also fits my suction base perfectly.</li>
      <li>she had really pretty lose curly wet hair</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my daughter who is ten years old.  </li>
      <li>She is already dang near bald headed now and blonde hair all over my house...</li>
      <li>We have ordered two other brunette heads in the past and they were fine.  </li>

    <li> the hair just fell out it had been so over processed it was not usable. they were very good about returning our money.</li>
    <li> This doll head is great I love it yes it sheds but you just have to be gentle when brushing it. It washes well and it curls very pretty. The ends are a little wispy but nothing a good trim can fix. Overall it great for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> Absolutely hate it.  The hair is techniqually 24&amp;#34; however,  it is so thin and it is layered horribly.  The hair is so rough and is constantly knots up.

    <li> Great for practicing hair styles. Also fits my suction base perfectly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas as she has interest in creating hairstyles and she loved it.</li>
    <li> This is the worst mannequin I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  The hair is gross and comes out in clumps.  It&#x27;s also a blend of human and synthetic and melts under heat styling.  STAY AWAY!</li>
    <li> Thought we found a real deal for a manniquin head for cosmetalogy school.  Shes bad several that was part of her tuition, we needed two more. Not worth the price, very poor quality and not real. State board tests are coming and were stuck with this crap.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for XMAS she really loves it to practice doing different hair styles on.  Nice gift for someone just starting out with hair.</li>
    <li> Great nice to work on, and not scary.</li>
    <li> When my children want to try something new, I believe they should have the right tools to practice with.  My daughter is into art, and hair.  We buy her the best brushes and paper.  So when I saw that you could buy an educational grade mannequin head to practice on, I jumped on it.  My daughter practices braiding, curling, and styling with &amp;#34;Amelia&amp;#34; (the dolls name) and really enjoys it.  I recommend this product, it is great.</li>
    <li> My mannequin&#x27;s hair was not as long as expected and could have been thicker. I bought it to practice for the upcoming prom season so I was a little disappointed with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my daughter&#x27;s cosmetology class training - this blonde head shed so badly it could not be used in the class and had to be returned.  We have ordered two other brunette heads in the past and they were fine.  Good news was that it was a quick and easy return with almost instant refund.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love the length but their is a lot of breakage because it was lightened.  It&#x27;s good enough for what I need it for tho (Cosmetology school) and I am satisfied.  She Marcel&#x27;s very nicely, also.</li>
    <li> Ordered this Doll for my daughter about two months ago. She is already dang near bald headed now and blonde hair all over my house...like cat hair!! I would never order again!!!</li>
    <li> Hair was over processed</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my tween daughters, who &amp;#34;outgrew&amp;#34; the Barbie heads, but still enjoy styling hair.  The mannequin met all of the specifications as described on the site.  The head is sturdy, but we do tend to lose hair during the brushing and styling. Though we are not using the mannequin heads professionally, the product description was accurate and we are satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality and very disappointed. Pulled this mannequin out of the box and the hair was already beyond damaged, couldnt get a brush through it without the hair falling out.</li>
    <li> its perfect to practice</li>
    <li> Bought her for updo practice. She comes in the box, looks nothing like the photo. Over processed and bleached out! More than half of her hair fell out and she lost 3 inch just from brushing.</li>
    <li> Absolutally horrid! Hair is so damaged that it is quite impossable to use in any practical way. On first use it sheds nearly half its hair due to poor workmanship. Stay away!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to practice styling and up dos it serves it purpose but sheds a lot.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who is ten years old.  She enjoys coloring and styling the hair so it was well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like ,because is very bad quality. It&#x27;s losing the hair from the first day that I bought  that</li>
    <li> I bought this for one of my granddaughters 10 years old. She enjoys DOING the hair and loves rolling it. Great investment, it.s teaching her to do her own hair and her friends.</li>
    <li> The doll did not come with a stand like the description said.</li>
    <li> I love this doll, however she is way too over processed.  That is why I gave 4 stars Her hair doesn&#x27;t look good blow dried, but looks very nice flat ironed and beveled.  I was working on her for 8 hours yesterday at school.  Washed twice cut twice blow dry twice flat iron twice did pin curls and a roller set.  I will definitely order again (should I want another blonde doll!!!) and she&#x27;s not ugly!!!&lt;br /&gt;Side note: she had really pretty lose curly wet hair</li>
    <li> I bought this for school and was pretty please. It&#x27;s a good price compared to other mannequins and the hair is nice however it does come out more then I feel it should while brushing/styling.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. The hair falls out really bad. It won&#x27;t be long and we will have a bald head!</li>
    <li> Bad shedding! The hair is soft, however, the length wasn&#x27;t a strong 24&amp;#34;. Only a few strands actually reached that length. I had to cut about 15 inches off</li>
    <li> was damaged from bleach hair keeps breaking worst purchase!</li>
    <li> Okay as a practice manni</li>
    <li> Exactly what my niece wanted for Christmas !!! A very happy hairdresser in the making !!!! Will def. buy again !</li>
    <li> SHED SOO MUCH , I ONLY HAVE IT FOR A DAY AND CUT IT BEC IT SHED MORE ND MORE AS U BRUSH IT I HATE IT ! BUT IT LOOKS LIKE TH PICTURE , GOOD LENGTH , BUT SHED TO MUCH</li>
