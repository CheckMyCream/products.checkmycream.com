      <li>Glides nicely through tangled hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of wondering how the &amp;#34;argon oil&amp;#34; this pick is infused with is going to &#x27;better&#x27; for hair.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of very fine hair.</li>
      <li>Its a very comfortable pick, does its job</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and goes through my hair nicely.</li>
      <li>This pick has made more of an impact on my hair than any product.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Some love them</li>
      <li>I love this pick.  </li>
      <li>* Love</li>
      <li>One of my favorite hair tools.</li>
      <li>It has smooth teeth, so it doesn&#x27;t stab me, which is nice.</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>This is definitely a great hair pick for natural hair.</li>
      <li>Well constructed with strong tines.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t snag or catch like the cheap plastic ones.</li>
      <li>The finish is extremely smooth and combs through my longish hair with ease.  </li>
      <li>The oil really helps the pick glide through my hair and cleans it up nicely.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the Cricket Ultra Smooth Hair Pick Comb infused with Argan Oil, Olive Oil and Keratin for months now.  </li>
      <li>Combine this with a good beard oil and your beard will love you back as if it was &amp;#34;Beard Day&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>This pick was the Best I&#x27;ve ever brought, I have thick curl hair and it made it so manageable easy to comb and keeps my hair shiny.</li>
      <li>It does nothing special.</li>
      <li>I like it because of the design, so I got 2, but it&#x27;s cool.</li>
      <li>This one has nice long tines, and is easy to hold.</li>
      <li>it might be good for other&#x27;s but for me just setting in the corner</li>
      <li>so was surprised when I went looking for one they are not that easy to find.  </li>
      <li>This one works even better because it is so smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel rough on my hair at all.</li>
      <li>How did I ever live without this!?!?!</li>
      <li>This hair pick is very gentle on the hair strands.</li>
      <li>Pretty close to unbreakable--would not travel with it--but does the trick.</li>
      <li>Great product for thick dry/colored hair.</li>
      <li>first off, I don&#x27;t believe the Argan or whatever it&#x27;s made with does anything.</li>
      <li>I read several reviews prior to purchasing it in which people said it was amazing with the infused oils.</li>
      <li>This hair pick is very functional.</li>
      <li>This does not get caught in your hair whether curly or straight.</li>
      <li>This a nice, heavy pick.</li>
      <li>Not sure exactly how the infused argon oil works, but the pick does a better job than anything else so far.</li>
      <li>Great hair pick for long thick curly hair.</li>
      <li>Three months post relaxer, so needed a new way of detangling.  </li>
      <li>However, this thing is gliding through my kinky 4c natural hair like butter.</li>
      <li>Now as far as the oil goes, there is no way to prove that all that oil is in the pick.</li>
      <li>I remember hating the old style picks because they would get caught up in and wind up hurting my hair.  </li>
      <li>No tangles, soft feel.</li>
      <li>I got it to replace an old one that my puppy had decided to chew up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sold on the infused plastic actually helping make hair softer, but even without that the pick is a decent buy.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s definitely not like my old picks.</li>
      <li>&#x27;Oil infused&#x27; nonsense aside, it&#x27;s a nice slick plastic, with a firm feel.</li>

    <li> it&#x27;s a very good pick. feels sturdy, goes through hair easily, looks great</li>
    <li> This is a great pick.  My hair is really coarse and can be hard to pick.  But this pick just seems to glide through my hair (whether dry or wet).  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great hair pick infused with oil. Combine this with a good beard oil and your beard will love you back as if it was &amp;#34;Beard Day&amp;#34;.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the comb.  It&#x27;s easy to hold and goes through my hair nicely.</li>
    <li> How did I ever live without this!?!?! This pick has made more of an impact on my hair than any product. I have a lot of very fine hair. This smooths it and removes knots, but without flattening.</li>
    <li> I am not sure whether the infused oils and keratin  actually affect the hair, but it is a decent pick.</li>
    <li> This hair pick is very gentle on the hair strands. Well made.  One of my favorite hair tools. Great price</li>
    <li> Works well for what I needed.</li>
    <li> Three months post relaxer, so needed a new way of detangling.  This pick is beautiful and gets through my hair nicely. Not sure exactly how the infused argon oil works, but the pick does a better job than anything else so far. Good buy.</li>
    <li> The pick arrived perfect and is exactly what it appears to be.  Its a pick.  I&#x27;m kind of wondering how the &amp;#34;argon oil&amp;#34; this pick is infused with is going to &#x27;better&#x27; for hair.  It has smooth teeth, so it doesn&#x27;t stab me, which is nice.</li>
    <li> This a nice, heavy pick. I like that I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to bend/break when I&#x27;m ripping through my long hair. However, I don&#x27;t know that it being &amp;#34;infused&amp;#34; with these oils has helped any. Still on the fence about that one.</li>
    <li> Well constructed with strong tines. I&#x27;m not sold on the infused plastic actually helping make hair softer, but even without that the pick is a decent buy.</li>
    <li> This hair pick is very functional. I read several reviews prior to purchasing it in which people said it was amazing with the infused oils. However, I do not agree. It is basically just a hair pick. But it is a little heavier than some and so it feels good when using it.</li>
    <li> Quite happy with this purchase, does the job well - I have very long curly hair and have never used a brush when wet always a pic so was surprised when I went looking for one they are not that easy to find.  This one has nice long tines, and is easy to hold.</li>
    <li> This pick was the Best I&#x27;ve ever brought, I have thick curl hair and it made it so manageable easy to comb and keeps my hair shiny. Might work different for others but I love it.</li>
    <li> Nice product: well made and nice looking.</li>
    <li> great for scratching the scap</li>
    <li> Its a very comfortable pick, does its job well</li>
    <li> it didnt workout for me but still very nice afro pick. So I gave it away to neighbor who loved it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realy need this brush i don&#x27;t know why i purchase it! it might be good for other&#x27;s but for me just setting in the corner</li>
    <li> ***** Love this Afro Pick  ---- Sturdy plastic construction and the ends are rounded not pointed ends that stab and hurt your scalp ...</li>
    <li> I like the comb it is just not large enough for the length of my hair. I wish they would make one for longer hair.</li>
    <li> This is a really basic pick. It works well for my needs.</li>
    <li> I love this pick.  It looks good, feels good and works good.  I ended up buying two of em.  The oil really helps the pick glide through my hair and cleans it up nicely.  Having rough hair like I do doesnt break the pick.  I ended up buying another.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a quality product but I&#x27;m not convinced it being infused with oil makes any difference. It does the job</li>
    <li> I remember hating the old style picks because they would get caught up in and wind up hurting my hair.  This pick does not hurt and it adds volume to my hair.  I don&#x27;t know whether it is the oils that are supposed to be in the pick, or the materials the pick is made from, but it definitely works for my dry, brittle hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for thick dry/colored hair. It does not damage your hair and goes through split ends without creating further damage.</li>
    <li> &#x27;Oil infused&#x27; nonsense aside, it&#x27;s a nice slick plastic, with a firm feel. It does the job. I don&#x27;t know about all the rest, but the price is good and I like the look</li>
    <li> first off, I don&#x27;t believe the Argan or whatever it&#x27;s made with does anything. I just don&#x27;t. Lol. However, this thing is gliding through my kinky 4c natural hair like butter. Only when its moisturized. Which usually, just to give a comparison, still gets caught on tangles and knots and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just going to say it&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s designed because I can&#x27;t process the argan thing yet. Lol. But I do recommend it. If the pick broke or I lost it, I&#x27;d buy it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh. When my hair is dry, i can feel the naps. But it&#x27;s definitely not like my old picks. I actually broke a pick in my hair before. Lol. No lie. Nobody knows me on here so it&#x27;s fine. Lol. But it was plastic and it broke because my hair was in some ultra nappy/kinky phase. Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metal picks to me are a no no. Some love them but I&#x27;ll never buy one ever again. They break my hair. And my hair get dry here and there but it&#x27;s not brittle. No metal picks. This is my current #1 pick though.</li>
    <li> Glides nicely through tangled hair.  Wish it was bigger however.  The handle is small and I use it with a blow dryer to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Pretty close to unbreakable--would not travel with it--but does the trick.</li>
    <li> This pick is very nicely designed for a good grip.  The finish is extremely smooth and combs through my longish hair with ease.  Doesn&#x27;t snag or catch like the cheap plastic ones.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a great hair pick for natural hair. Plus, it makes a sturdy scalp scratcher/ massager!</li>
    <li> I ordered this based off of the 2 reviews I read, but it&#x27;s just a regular pick. It does nothing special. Just a plastic pic that does the job. Now as far as the oil goes, there is no way to prove that all that oil is in the pick. I guess. I like it because of the design, so I got 2, but it&#x27;s cool.</li>
    <li> Like this hair pick a lot. I got it to replace an old one that my puppy had decided to chew up. This one works even better because it is so smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel rough on my hair at all. I use it when I get out of the shower to get the tangles out and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Cricket Ultra Smooth Hair Pick Comb infused with Argan Oil, Olive Oil and Keratin for months now.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference than using a regular hair pick comb.</li>
    <li> Great hair pick for long thick curly hair. No tangles, soft feel.</li>
</ol>
