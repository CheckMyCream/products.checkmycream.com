      <li>Arrive on time great product been using it for years</li>

      <li>Using it to make my own beauty products and it works great.</li>
      <li>It has been excellent and super beneficial for our son&#x27;s severe eczema.  </li>

      <li>I love the quality of this Shea Butter!</li>
      <li>Love this shea butter!  </li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>though is literally amazing.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!!!</li>
      <li>Perfect for my 69 yr old skin.</li>
      <li>She was happy with the large size of the item.  </li>
      <li>However, my favorite way is in a plastic sealed container.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I cannot count how many times we have ordered it.  </li>
      <li>I bought this  but did not reach more than two months</li>
      <li>More than met my expectations.</li>
      <li>Love have ordered  4 times</li>
      <li>The shea butter itself is wonderful, it is the only lotion my daughter will allow me to put on her</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Not to sure about this product.  </li>
      <li>The packing could be better though.</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>Thank you for fast shipping!!!!</li>
      <li>That is why a double-boiler, or even a glass container setting in a pot of hot water while stirring the lotion is really your best</li>
      <li>It never burns her skin a bit like every other lotion tends to do, and is a wonderful moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Easy to scoop the desired amount out using a spoon.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery!</li>
      <li>However, I have not ordered this since the whole Ebola thing and honestly have been concerned about it because of the &amp;#34;hands on&amp;#34; way it is harvested.  </li>
      <li>When it cools I wipe my face clean.</li>
      <li>My skin is amazing after 1 month using this, my husband can&#x27;t believe how soft it has become.</li>
      <li>Loving it so far, I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>Just put the whole thing in a zip lock baggie and worked just fine.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about the smell</li>
      <li>Of course, Amazon is a dream with returns, as expected, as after many years of using Amazon, I&#x27;m pretty sure this is my very first return</li>
      <li>so make sure you mimic with other better smelling products</li>
      <li>A tall tub full of pure</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what I was hoping it would be.</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m done I sit a hot cloth on my face and neck.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not the real deal.</li>
      <li>Very nourishing butter cream.</li>
      <li>I have used it alone on my natural hair and mixed it with Jamaican Black Castor Oil with beautiful results on my twists.  </li>
      <li>I took it off down about an inch and seems okay.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely pay more attention in the future.</li>
      <li>I have also used the shea butter on my body;  particularly my feet.  </li>
      <li>When you melt it to add something like jojoba oil or whatever you want, you will need to very gently melt it just enough to be pliable and able to stir in your other ingredients.  </li>
      <li>That is normal.  </li>
      <li>Makes skin very soft.</li>
      <li>Therefore, not raw.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product based on recommendations from YouTube videos about natural skin and hair care.</li>
      <li>these natural products,  for me, was like coming home again.  </li>
      <li>It just smelled like any old, rancid vegetable oil.</li>
      <li>The Shea Butter I received was so old and rancid that it had no &amp;#34;shea&amp;#34; aroma at all.</li>
      <li>That is normal and if that happens, note that the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; WILL melt back to a normal smooth consistency once it&#x27;s on your body for a few moments.  </li>
      <li>bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;raw shea&amp;#34; you see in stores that is substantially more expensive and usually more white, has typically be heated, whipped, and/or processed.  </li>
      <li>I stay moisturized for almost the entire day even after frequent hand washings!  </li>
      <li>Will purchase again in the near future.</li>
      <li>We are of the earth, it only makes sense that natural products from the earth&#x27;s cubbard would work sooo well.</li>
      <li>Sometimes in a large ziplock type bag, other times it is wrapped in plastic wrap.  </li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t send it back because I really needed it for my husbands dry legs.  </li>
      <li>No heavy smell and provides long lasting moisture on the skin.</li>

<li> No heavy smell and provides long lasting moisture on the skin.</li>
<li> I want to see how my hair and skin react from long term use.  </li>
<li> I purchased this product because I have dry skin.</li>
<li> The consistency is normally very thick, smells raw (not terrible, but there will be a raw smell to it that can go away when you add essential oils</li>
<li> My hair is very very dry</li>
<li> A little grainy compared to African Republic product.</li>
<li> It came in a bag and not a round container and to hard to rub on skin</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not very sturdy.</li>
<li> Just what I expected...</li>
<li> Some pieces are white; it came in a ziplock bag opposed to a container; it does not have the nutty smell that raw Shea possesses; and it&#x27;s creamier, not as gritty as raw shea should be.  </li>
<li> I then take a shower or take care of other essentials.  </li>
<li> dry leaving a little moisture on skin, then rub the liquid</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used Raw Shea Butter for a long time</li>
<li> In 2 to 3 days my skin had a glow I had been missing.  </li>
<li> (just a few drops per about 4</li>
<li> The plastic container it came in broke right away, which was a little annoying for storage purposes -</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t technically &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; it, because I failed to look at where it was coming from.</li>
<li> This product is like some buttery substance mixed with sand , sorry to say that</li>
<li> It has never stained anything of ours and it is very, very thick because it is genuinely raw.  </li>
<li> It is very unlikely that items of this nature that are &amp;#34;fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34; are stored properly, which is something I hadn&#x27;t considered.</li>
<li> I purchase Shea butter in the past but this one compare is fake</li>
<li> the packaging however was broken and I had to put it in another container.</li>
<li> Container was broken on arrival but no issue with the product and understand it&#x27;s cold and plastic doesn&#x27;t hold up well in the cold.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing. Definitely worth the money!!! A tall tub full of pure she butter!!! Thank you for fast shipping!!!! Amazing experience!!</li>
    <li> Not to sure about this product.  I&#x27;ve used Raw Shea Butter for a long time but this is a bit different.  Some pieces are white; it came in a ziplock bag opposed to a container; it does not have the nutty smell that raw Shea possesses; and it&#x27;s creamier, not as gritty as raw shea should be.  A bit apprehensive in regards to the quality.</li>
    <li> very very good moisturizer</li>
    <li> Arrive on time great product been using it for years</li>
    <li> the shea butter is beautiful, it is just what I need.  the packaging however was broken and I had to put it in another container. I will still order again.</li>
    <li> Really big box. Makes skin very soft. Love it.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I was hoping it would be. 100% Shea butter cream is what I wanted for my son&#x27;s skin to help with his eczema. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. The packing could be better though. It&#x27;s not very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Very nourishing butter cream. No heavy smell and provides long lasting moisture on the skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on recommendations from YouTube videos about natural skin and hair care. I have only used it a very short time (a week) but my skin and hair responded immediately.  My skin breathed a sigh of comfort and relief from the drying affects of soap and cleansers. I melt the shea butter in my hands and spread it on my face and neck. I then take a shower or take care of other essentials.  When I&#x27;m done I sit a hot cloth on my face and neck.  When it cools I wipe my face clean. In 2 to 3 days my skin had a glow I had been missing.  I have also used the shea butter on my body;  particularly my feet.  What a difference to lotion.  The moisturizing for me lasted over 24 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;My hair drank up the oil like a welcomed change and softened beautifully.  I have used it alone on my natural hair and mixed it with Jamaican Black Castor Oil with beautiful results on my twists.  My hair is very very dry so being generous hasn&#x27;t posed a problem.  I can see how others may have an issue of oily build up though. I would try it sparingly at first.&lt;br /&gt;Using these natural products,  for me, was like coming home again.  We are of the earth, it only makes sense that natural products from the earth&#x27;s cubbard would work sooo well. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars just because I&#x27;ve used it for such a short time. I want to see how my hair and skin react from long term use.  Loving it so far, I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I mix it with Almond and Coconut oil and shea butter.  Perfect for my 69 yr old skin.</li>
    <li> Love have ordered  4 times</li>
    <li> I bought it for my sister.</li>
    <li> More than met my expectations. Have shared this and they like it too. I will order more, it is a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this  but did not reach more than two months</li>
    <li> A little grainy compared to African Republic product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I have dry skin. Before I apply this product to my skin, I spoon out the amount I think I am going to use, place in microwave to liquefy, hop in the shower, pat dry leaving a little moisture on skin, then rub the liquid all iver my body to lock in the moisture from the shower! I stay moisturized for almost the entire day even after frequent hand washings!  I definitely will order this again when my 28oz run out!</li>
    <li> My container was damaged</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this Shea Butter! Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, however it would be better to have it in plastic boxes so that it could be used immediately</li>
    <li> Just what I expected... Using it to make my own beauty products and it works great. Easy to scoop the desired amount out using a spoon. The plastic container it came in broke right away, which was a little annoying for storage purposes - but I just keep it in a ziplock now.</li>
    <li> I purchase Shea butter in the past but this one compare is fake it&#x27;s not the real deal. This product is like some buttery substance mixed with sand , sorry to say that but it&#x27;s true.</li>
    <li> The Shea butter I received was coated in something I thought might be mold.  I took it off down about an inch and seems okay.  i didn&#x27;t send it back because I really needed it for my husbands dry legs.  it has worked wonders.</li>
    <li> this shea butter is awesome. I used it for everything. I turned it to a whipped butter ,hair mask, lip and undereye moisturizer</li>
    <li> My skin is amazing after 1 month using this, my husband can&#x27;t believe how soft it has become. Not crazy about the smell so make sure you mimic with other better smelling products</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t technically &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; it, because I failed to look at where it was coming from. It is very unlikely that items of this nature that are &amp;#34;fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34; are stored properly, which is something I hadn&#x27;t considered. I&#x27;ve never had a problem, but I don&#x27;t often order items of this nature from Amazon and this was a link from a trusted website, so I just did it. I will definitely pay more attention in the future. The Shea Butter I received was so old and rancid that it had no &amp;#34;shea&amp;#34; aroma at all. It just smelled like any old, rancid vegetable oil. Of course, Amazon is a dream with returns, as expected, as after many years of using Amazon, I&#x27;m pretty sure this is my very first return and it was 100% painless.</li>
    <li> The shea butter itself is wonderful, it is the only lotion my daughter will allow me to put on her (she has severe eczema). It never burns her skin a bit like every other lotion tends to do, and is a wonderful moisturizer. My only problem is that each time we have ordered this product, it has not been packaged well and the plastic jar has been cracked upon arrival.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter.  She was happy with the large size of the item.  Will purchase again in the near future.</li>
    <li> It came in a bag and not a round container and to hard to rub on skin</li>
    <li> Love this shea butter!  It has been excellent and super beneficial for our son&#x27;s severe eczema.  However, I have not ordered this since the whole Ebola thing and honestly have been concerned about it because of the &amp;#34;hands on&amp;#34; way it is harvested.  The shea butter itself though is literally amazing.  I cannot count how many times we have ordered it.  But it does tend to arrive in various ways though.  Sometimes in a large ziplock type bag, other times it is wrapped in plastic wrap.  However, my favorite way is in a plastic sealed container.  The consistency is normally very thick, smells raw (not terrible, but there will be a raw smell to it that can go away when you add essential oils (just a few drops per about 4 ounces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that if you actually research shea, you will find that it is supposed to be yellow.  That is normal.  It has never stained anything of ours and it is very, very thick because it is genuinely raw.  When you melt it to add something like jojoba oil or whatever you want, you will need to very gently melt it just enough to be pliable and able to stir in your other ingredients.  If you &amp;#34;overcook&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;overheat&amp;#34; it, it will become gritty feeling.  That is normal and if that happens, note that the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; WILL melt back to a normal smooth consistency once it&#x27;s on your body for a few moments.  That is why a double-boiler, or even a glass container setting in a pot of hot water while stirring the lotion is really your best bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;raw shea&amp;#34; you see in stores that is substantially more expensive and usually more white, has typically be heated, whipped, and/or processed.  Therefore, not raw.  I hope this is helpful info!</li>
    <li> Container was broken on arrival but no issue with the product and understand it&#x27;s cold and plastic doesn&#x27;t hold up well in the cold. Just put the whole thing in a zip lock baggie and worked just fine. Quick delivery!</li>
