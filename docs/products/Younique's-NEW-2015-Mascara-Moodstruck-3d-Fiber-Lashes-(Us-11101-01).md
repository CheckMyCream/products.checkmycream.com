      <li>Seriously amazing results.</li>
      <li>On a warm day,  baking in the sun too.</li>
      <li>I am giving it 2 stars because I am a no-muss no-fuss kind of girl and wasn&#x27;t expecting to have to put one coat of mascara, one coat of the fibers followed by another coat of mascara.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t really all that impressed.</li>
      <li>I feel that this was a good buy as it is better tha</li>
      <li>Thanks Younique for making an awesome mascara.</li>
      <li>Make sure you coat your eyelashes with the fibers BEFORE the sealer dries, and then make sure to put another coat of sealer on after that, if you don&#x27;t the fibers will just fall off during the day and land all over your face!</li>
      <li>which is one more reason to just love it!</li>
      <li>By far the best mascara that I owned.</li>
      <li>This is the most effective lengthening mascara I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I love it and it is worth every penny!!!</li>
      <li>Love love love this product!</li>
      <li>I love Younique 3D Fiber Lashes...</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re Real mascara, was a great accompaniment to the fiber lashes.</li>
      <li>Items purchased through Younique&#x27;s website are backed by the The Love</li>
      <li>and if my opinion ever changes I will gladly return to update it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had better mascara from walgreens.</li>
      <li>, the fibers don&#x27;t stay put as they do with the authentic product.</li>
      <li>You can buy a better product in Walmart.</li>
      <li>Is there a better way to keep them in tact?</li>
      <li>If you need a presenter I would love to help you get the genuine product!</li>
      <li>When you put on more that 2 coats the fibers end up on your cheeks.</li>
      <li>I do suggest taking it off at night because the fiber will go in your eyes :)</li>
      <li>and it so much better then</li>
      <li>but it was not all that magical.</li>
      <li>Look forward to trying more of your products.</li>
      <li>I Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.  </li>

      <li>I do get many compliments about my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>and it just ends up in more places than your lashes.</li>
      <li>I just love it,  I bought because the steamer on my expresso machine stopped working</li>
      <li>I LOVE that it thickens and lengthens my eyelashes like a set of falsies.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Learning curve... less goes a long way.  Gently from 1/2 down the lashes apply fibers.  It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I had lash extensions and had them filled every two weeks at one time and they ruined my lashes.  Never again.  I will only use this product.  Love, love!!</li>
    <li> I lost some of my eyelashes due to hypothroidism and thought I would try this because a friend said it was wonderful and it is!!!  I have never spent this much on mascara but it was well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> This product does extend my lashes a great deal. So far I have not noticed that it smudges at all.  I feel that this was a good buy as it is better tha an mascara I have ever had!</li>
    <li> I found this cheaper than anywhere else and it&#x27;s the real product I just love it my eyes look so good so I hope people buy this and it actually didn&#x27;t take as long as it said at first so that was even better.</li>
    <li> The fiber falls apart and it goes on your face and in your eyes.It creates a dark circle under your eye that looks ugly and hard to cleanup without makeup remover. It does make eye lashes fuller a little but not as much and since it makes black circle under your eye it doesn&#x27;t worth having that fuller eye lash this way. I am back to my favorite mascara after using this product for three days only. waste of money,</li>
    <li> I just love this product and am glad I found it!!!</li>
    <li> I LUV it!! Notice a difference in my lashes!! I will definitely order another 3D Moonstruck mascara!!</li>
    <li> Wow I am very upset with my purchase. First the package was damaged when received. And then when I opened the transplant gel it smelt like PAINT! The fibers are long and hairy as well. I am NOT risking Puting this on my eyes.! Thank you for the FAKE younique. Getting my refund right away.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Exactly what I wanted and expected!</li>
    <li> It really stinks, Im not sure I will continue to use it because Im not sure I can tolerate the smell. It&#x27;s pretty easy to put on, I was not aware that you started with your own mascara then you applied this product. I feel like that may be something that is shared before purchasing. So 3 coats of stuff on your eyes unless you decide to add more fiber....... It also does take a little longer to dry then I am used to. Too pricey in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Not authentic unless purchased directly from Younique&#x27;s site or through a Younique Presenter. Younique&#x27;s NEW 2015 3D+ Mascara looks nothing like this. This entire advertisement is false.</li>
    <li> Order from a different company initially &amp; loved the product. I think the one I received this time was fake.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the price.  I find that ideally I would need to reapply during the work day, but I seldom have the time.  On days that I cannot I still have a much fuller look to my eyes.  Definitely an improvement over other mascaras that I have tried.  Follow the directions and you will not have a problem. Tip - I do use a Q-tip to touch up areas around that eye that small particles of the fibers sometimes fall.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!! I have noticeable lashes! LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara!!!</li>
    <li> Please for your health and safety buy from a real Younique presenter. The real deal is so amazing that so many other companies have tried to duplicate with some very hazardous  results. Buy the real thing youniqueproducts.com/jeannejones1</li>
    <li> I have pretty good lashes to begin with. This just makes them phenomenal. I used one coat of Maybelline The Falsies (waterproof), then did 2 applications of this. Root to tip. It stayed looking great all day. On a warm day,  baking in the sun too.</li>
    <li> Dried up and unable to use. Sent back and did not re-order.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all the fiber was falling all in my eyes instead of staying on my lashes.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I hoped for, amazing product!</li>
    <li> Was not delivered on &amp;#34;guarenteed delivery date&amp;#34; and this product is not the real deal. I tried this on and it looked horrible and clumpy. Will be returning this immediately.</li>
    <li> I absolutely fell in love. It came quickly and was packaged well. The only thing is that some of the fibers fall into your eyes. It doesn&#x27;t hurt and they work themselves out fast but it is a little annoying.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Seriously amazing results.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This is the first yo unique product I have purchased will buy again</li>
    <li> Ok, seriously, the &amp;#34;1 star&amp;#34; people must be doing something wrong.  And, even if it&#x27;s a knock off, it still works great.  This product is amazeBALLS!!</li>
    <li> I love the Younique 3D fiberlash mascara.  I naturally have very straight, short lashes so this really gave me that WOW factor! It looked like I was wearing fake eyelashes.  Some tips for applying it are to put a coat of your favorite mascara on first and let that dry, then coat those with the &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34; tube from Younique (I think it&#x27;s called the sealer).  Make sure you coat your eyelashes with the fibers BEFORE the sealer dries, and then make sure to put another coat of sealer on after that, if you don&#x27;t the fibers will just fall off during the day and land all over your face! It&#x27;s also easier to do one eye at a time :) hope this helps</li>
    <li> The fake is running rampid. Your best best is to ordering directly from a presenter.&lt;br /&gt;www.youniqueproducts.com/beautybyYonnetteNurse</li>
    <li> This product was amazing at first but after about a week, I noticed that the fibers were falling on my face. I had constant black residue under my eyes</li>
    <li> When I received the product it was completely dried out so I couldn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> DO NOT ORDER! I was skeptical in the first place, but thought Amazon was reputable enough to place my order. This has to be an imitation of the actual Younique mascara, which I&#x27;ve been using for a while. It looks the same, but all materials are of a cheaper quality. The wand to the fiber lashes is crooked and the fiber pieces are clumpy and strange.</li>
    <li> I love Younique 3D Fiber Lashes...unfortunately, this is not the real thing. I usually buy through a Younique representative. I decided to order here because it was faster and the shipping was free. Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this product is not even close to the awesomeness that is Younique. It looks exactly the same, but there is no stopper function at the mouth of the fiber tube, so when you take out the wand, it has way too much on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fibers don&#x27;t stay put as they do with the authentic product. I learned my lesson; I&#x27;ll never buy this here again.</li>
    <li> It does not do what it says.  You can buy a better product in Walmart.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and the seller was very helpful by letting me know it would be late.</li>
    <li> This is a counterfeit product. You must purchase directly through Younique to get the real product.</li>
    <li> After many many years of trying to find a mascara that made my lashes look full and added length I finally found one in Younique&#x27;s Moodstruck  3D Fiber Mascara.  Hint --- makes sure you apply a coat of regular mascara before you start with the 3D mascara.  I will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> Horrible! Fibers flaked off into my eyes. Lots of trouble removing it. My eyes are bloodshot and extremely irritated. I hope it doesn&#x27;t cause an infection.</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff. It works well for ME. It runs a little on super hot day. However, Im in a high humidity area. When the merchandise is new some of the fibers fall on your face during application. I don&#x27;t wear any other makeup so clean up is easy. Someone wearing foundation may not agree.  I do get many compliments about my eyelashes. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now. If you do, plan to buy a new one every 3 months.</li>
    <li> I have tried this before. I bought it from a party hosted by someone who was selling Younique. It worked very well.  The set I ordered here was almost empty. It was as if someone had been using it.</li>
    <li> Came to me all dried out.  Couldn&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
    <li> This claims to be Younique, but it&#x27;s a fake.  The labels are similar, but it&#x27;s not the real thing.  I contacted a Younique presenter who told me you can only get Younique thru Younique.  Plus when this arrived, it looked like it had been used.  Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a Tuesday night and I got it in the mail Thursday morning!! Quick delivery and this mascara is amazing! I will be buying this as soon as mine runs out!!</li>
    <li> Only thing that I hate is the fiber gets on my face</li>
    <li> This is the most effective lengthening mascara I have ever tried. It is worth the money. I am curious to see how long one tube will last. It takes a little practice to keep the fibers from falling on your cheek, but that stems from using to much at one time before securing it with the transplanting gel.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Who cares if it &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; I have bought one from a younique presenter and also off of amazon. I have compared them and researched them and they are made from the exact same ingredients. If I can get a so called &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; one on her for a little cheaper then who cares. I love both of my younique mascara&#x27;s. It&#x27;s probably all made in the same factor too. Both of mine say made in china.</li>
    <li> The greatest products I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Not impressed ... First if you wear contact lenses this is not the product for you Second I like to look very feminine and this does not give that effect its thick and odd and the fibers are uncontrollable at one point thought I was applying it wrong but watched a few videos and I was not it is simply a terrible product will be sending back as soon as possible. One more thing if it is humid where you live and you apply this product be prepared for your fake lashes to start pointing downward and I mean straight downward like your eyes have bangs for lashes. My husband said this when he saw me finish, you look like possibly a man that wants to be a woman or possibly a bar wh**e thats been crying all night&amp;#34;I won&#x27;t even write what he said when he saw them melting and covering my eyes like curtains - terrible</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I am giving it 2 stars because I am a no-muss no-fuss kind of girl and wasn&#x27;t expecting to have to put one coat of mascara, one coat of the fibers followed by another coat of mascara. I have been continuing to use it in hopes I will get the results I was expecting. But over all the appearance, packaging and buying process was fantastic!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really all that impressed. I feel like it didn&#x27;t add much to my eyelashes. I was hopping it would help them stand out More and be fore noticeable and I didn&#x27;t feel like it did that at ax</li>
    <li> Good price and the product was very easy to use and it lasted all day (waterproof).</li>
    <li> Having difficulty coating the fibers so they don&#x27;t flake into my eyes during the day.</li>
    <li> The tubes feel lighter than the ones I&#x27;ve had previously - almost like they are near empty.  The mascara does not go on as well as I&#x27;m used to, seeming to require more application than normal.</li>
    <li> I have used yo unique before so I knew it was a good product. However, the transplanting gel was a little dry. I didn&#x27;t get the same results from this purchase as I did when I bought directly from a girl who was selling it. I Will purchase it again but maybe directly from someone who sells it from their home.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the hype- but wow! My eyelashes never looked so full. You have to be careful because they can become clumpy but with a little practice, this is an awesome product!!!</li>
    <li> I love the product itself and the customer service was outstanding. I will defiantly shop here again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is not the original. It is horrible and I will never buy it again..</li>
    <li> Its great when it comes out right.&lt;br /&gt;But ive experienced too many clumps...&lt;br /&gt;The brush had clumps on it, i was never able to get rid of them 😕</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing!! One thing i will say is that u definitely have to work with it and practice....ive learned a few things to make ur eyelashes amazing....u need to use a lengthening mascara not a volumizing one first or ur lashes will clump....make sure u r wiping off the excess transplanting gel before applying to ur eyelashes, and apply the fibers quickly after focusing on the upper half of ur eyelashes, then let that stand for a minute and swipe on the transplanting gel again to set the fibers...and eyelash comb or spool is great to have to finish with separating ur eyelashes, love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I watched a ton of videos on this product and was excited to try it. I will say that your lashes will be extremely long after applying it; however, it does flake off throughout the day. It&#x27;s also extremely clumpy, so make sure to use a lash brush to comb through your lashes after applying. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price or all of the hype!</li>
    <li> Very flaky. After an hour I had black under eye. Looked like black eyes. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Delivered sooner than expected. Awesome product my lashes look marvelous</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money on the fake stuff. Get the real stuff and the new 3D now.&lt;br /&gt;(...)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very upset I bought this sale back I just opened it and it&#x27;s broke!!!</li>
    <li> They work wonders! Absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> Really does work. It is the best mascara I have ever used. It washes off easily and does not irritate the eyes.</li>
    <li> LOVE this mascara.  Arrived fast and as expected.</li>
    <li> My mascara loving daughter is very happy with this product. Her eyelashes look long and thick- she loves it .</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.  Ive been using it for a year now and would&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> i saw this product on a youtube video and thought it looked great. however, maybe i&#x27;m applying it wrong but it flakes all day. i find little fibers around my eyes which is bother some for me because  I ware contact lenses. however, it does what it says, awesome look like falsies.</li>
    <li> So I opened it to check it out and the big mascara seemed fine I opened the smaller one and it was completely empty and the brush was falling apart...lame.</li>
    <li> If anyone has wondered if this product works??? IT DOES! Truly a gift for the eyelash challenged.</li>
    <li> When you put on more that 2 coats the fibers end up on your cheeks. And with 1,2 coats the effect is not as drastic.</li>
    <li> Love the product but not something for me for daily use. I use it for special occasions.</li>
    <li> The gel was very stringy, not sure if this is how it is suppose to be or not.</li>
    <li> This product was as expected.</li>
    <li> Great product love the results</li>
    <li> Amazing! Better than false lashes</li>
    <li> I dont understand the hype of this product. The fibers get in my eye and I&#x27;ve had better mascara from walgreens. Not worth the money in my opinion or the maintenance.</li>
    <li> I am on the fence with this product. I have only applied once and though they are longer looking they also clump. I can get the same results by applying reg cheap mascara 3 x letting dry in between. My vision seemed weakened in a sense when I had the mascara on.  The positive is it comes in a nice hard case. I am going to try again for a social function to see if I get same results regarding my eyes vision</li>
    <li> This is NOT Younique&#x27;s 3D Fiber Mascara! This is a knock off product. Younique products do NOT come with barcodes. They are ONLY available through a Younique Presenter and through Younique&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d like to see the real product please check out: [...]. Items purchased through Younique&#x27;s website are backed by the The Love It Guarantee.</li>
    <li> Def takes some practicing, if you use too much of the fiber itll crumble and irritate eyes thats about the only thing i dont like about the product.</li>
    <li> Selling this through an external website is against company policy. If it has any kind of smell, it&#x27;s not real. It is difficult to tell the difference between the two unless you have them side by side. The font on the replica is smaller on the case, and inside the case. The replica has a thinner gel which can have a chemical smell. If you&#x27;re not buying from a presenter, it&#x27;s probably not real. The replicas fibers can have a shine to them and may contain fiberglass. I wouldn&#x27;t risk having that near my eyes. The real fibers are a matte black color and made of natural green tea fibers. Again it can be hard to tell the difference unless you have the real and fake product side by side. Don&#x27;t risk having a fake product with harmful chemicals and order straight from a younique presenter. Watch a video comparing them on youtube. Do your research if you&#x27;re not sure.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff it actually makes my eye lashes look amazing</li>
    <li> Wand to fiber lashes broke off in tube. Used once.</li>
    <li> Hate it!  It flakes off after an hour and it leaves black rings under the eye. When you first apply it, it is amazing,  but after an hour,  you have raccoon eyes and no lashes. It just looks messy.</li>
    <li> I love. Better than false eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I just love it,  I bought because the steamer on my expresso machine stopped working and it so much better then the steamer.</li>
    <li> So I just received this mascara... First application was this morning. My lashes are pretty long to begin with but this definitely takes them to the next level. The only issue I have with it is that the little fibers keep getting in my eye and underneath making it look like I have circles. I keep wiping them off with a tissue but they build back up. I really don&#x27;t want to have to keep worrying about wiping them off and then that is removing my concealer underneath and I have to keep re-applying that. Is there a better way to keep them in tact?</li>
    <li> My $5 Walmart mascara is just as good as this one. I was very disappointed with this purchase. :( I&#x27;m wondering if this is the real stuff or just a fake.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara, I will give the pros and cons.  I have very short thin lashes, so I needed something to make them long and more defined.  I have been using it for 3 days now, it is easy to put on, does make my lashes long and thicker.  They do look good!  Cons, need to re appy after about a couple of hours, not waterproof, and you will get little hairs all over your face, and sometimes in your eyes.  Even though I have had some issues with it, I would still repurchase, for this reason, I have a real problems finding good mascara.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all. It flakes really bad and I felt like a had lint on my lashes all day. I only gave it a 1 rating because I did like the box it came in.</li>
    <li> Great product delivered on time.  Wife removed her false eyelashes and started using this instead.  She loves this product and it&#x27;s results.</li>
    <li> This product irritates me, I have tried several ways to apply it and I still get black eyes half way through the day.</li>
    <li> I was happy with this product once I got used to the application of it.</li>
    <li> need to be careful fibers don&#x27;t fall in eyes</li>
    <li> I am very happy with Younique Mascara.  I previously ordered an off brand and it wasn&#x27;t the same as Younique which I had used before.</li>
    <li> I had to returned it bc one tube was empty!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Will order agai</li>
    <li> Buy the real thing!  Younique lashes are amazing.  I have thin, short lashes and younique makes me look like I have extensions.  I don&#x27;t sell Younique lashes, I just love them!  This is NOT the real thing!</li>
    <li> Was a gift, she said it great !</li>
    <li> totaly dry, disappointed</li>
    <li> Definitely works just be sure to apply according to the directions without skipping any of the steps. A great way to enhance what mother nature gave without resorting to expensive extensions. Comes off easily with makeup removal wipes.</li>
    <li> I notice that you need to use several quotes to make it show, and sometimes working people specially when getting ready for work, it&#x27;s not enough time to work it out.  Maybe for a night time use, when you have more time to be ready. .</li>
    <li> By far the best mascara that I owned. I love how they make my eye lashes longer than what they really are. With the other mascaras I had to keep adding coats for them to look long and full but with this one I just apply it once and they look amazing! I always get compliments when I have it on.&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#x27;t cause me any irritation and it is easy to take off.</li>
    <li> Cool stuff but expect to commit some time for application.</li>
    <li> The product was very runny and sticky. Unlike the Younique products I purchased through a Younique presenter. Wasn&#x27;t happy with my purchase and will just stick with buying directly from a presenter with Younique.</li>
    <li> It is the actual product! Not fake as I feared it might be.</li>
    <li> Immediate results! Impressive!</li>
    <li> This is the only brand I will buy!!! It&#x27;s the Best!!!!</li>
    <li> I found the product ran all day along so if you don&#x27;t mind cleaning around your eyes all day it&#x27;s a great product</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it when I don&#x27;t have it on I feel like I look weird. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle! It takes a little practice to apply, but now I wear it daily because it makes such a big difference!</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time, it works BEAUTIFULLY!! I am very satisfied with this product and would suggest it for anyone&#x27;s use! :) GREAT BUY, Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY short eyelashes and I can&#x27;t wear fake ones they irritate my eyes. This product REALLY WORKS! I am so impressed I will be buying this for the rest of my life LOL! It is great and my lashes are super long with this product. I love it and it is worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I got this mascara for Christmas as I had wanted it for a very long time. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it as I have heard people say such wonderful things about it. The packaging and the case it comes with is very nice. Although I am not as happy with the product itself. It comes with 2 pieces. 1 is the gel and that is what you use first. You put it on just like regular mascara and then you quickly add the fibers. You then add a coat of the gel to hold all the fibers on. You that until you achieve the look you want. I was not impressed with the fibers. They are like a bunch of tiny hairs. They hurt when you get them in your eyes. I feel like they make your lashes look like spider legs. That is the best way to describe it. Maybe I haven&#x27;t practise enough or I am not doing it correct but I would not recommend this product to others. I was not 100% satisfied. I will continue to try to use this product from time to time to see if maybe it is me and if my opinion ever changes I will gladly return to update it. I did not purchase it through amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a fake, a poor knockoff.  They did a great job,until I this label on the back . On the real product &amp;#34;Transplanting Gel.....) is in a different area. But the dupe has it directly under the first line of text. Plus this crap has a terrible smell. I&#x27;m afraid to put this on my eyes.  This stuff stinks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this, and it was a total disappointment.  It made my lashes look darker and fuller, but no additional length.  Here&#x27;s a comparison with my regular mascara  (Extend a lash). Eye in pink eyeshadow, is Loreal Double Extend;my normal mascara.  And the gold eyeshadow is this product. Pictures to come soon</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! It&#x27;s pretty much an alternative for buying fake lashes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after my cousin used it at a makeup party.  The price was a little more than what I normally spend on cosmetics, so I decided to treat myself.  I used it during my family reunion this summer.  The heat was ridiculous and I was fearful it would run or smear off my eyes.  To my surprise, It stayed and my lashes looked fuller and longer after using the product.  I was very happy with the results and I will probably never purchase eye lashes again.</li>
    <li> Although the product itself was shipped in good condition and was somewhat effective, I realized it was not manufactured by Younique, as I discovered the four digit code on the back of the case. If you don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s not the real deal, then it&#x27;s worth paying the $22 or so for it. Otherwise, purchase the product from the Younique website or from a presenter.</li>
    <li> I am a presenter with Younique and I can tell you there is no way these are actual Younique product. Younique does not sell to it allow their items to be sold on Amazon, EBay, or any other such site. The only way you can obtain genuine Younique product is from a presenter. PleSe be careful purchasing fake product as it does not follow the same international guidelines and can be damaging to your eyes. Younique also give you a 14 day Love It Guarantee that you will not get with this. If you need a presenter I would love to help you get the genuine product! lovelylashlisa.com</li>
    <li> After reading the previous review stating its FAKE, I gave it a  benifit of the doubt and still ordered. Lo Behold and received mine today and carefully looked at the label that was on the plastic wrap covering the label on box itself. It stated 2015 Mascara US-1101-01 but when I took the plastic wrap off the label on the box differs as you can see on the picture it is the label of the FAKE item that others has received. And also the fiber container is EMPTY.  I am disappointed therefore I am returning this item.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! Highly recommend this</li>
    <li> I have used this product before but purchased at a bridal show.  It worked so well and my lashes looked great - not over done.  I have really fine lashes and this product is great,  However, for some reason this product that I ordered did not work as well.  I think I will just wait to purchase locally.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the little lashes fall off during the day making my make up and face look awful</li>
    <li> time consuming and difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> LOVE the fiber lash mascara...it is amazing!</li>
    <li> Item as described. Works well.</li>
    <li> Best stuff in the world, dont bother buying cheaper brands to save a couple dollars!!</li>
    <li> I have only used my mascara three times since getting it, Maybe the more I work with it the better it will be?  I don&#x27;t feel as though it extends my lashes as long as what the picture shows and the fibers are not what I expected. It is completely dry and hard to put on.</li>
    <li> The whole product is amazing, from the packaging, to the actual fiber lashes themselves.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned from trial and error that you get a best result using a mascara that has a very prickly wand I.E. Benefits they&#x27;re Real mascara, was a great accompaniment to the fiber lashes. It separates your lashes so they don&#x27;t clump when you use the transplanting gel, let it dry but not too long, then add the fibers, followed by another coat of the transplanting gel. I&#x27;ve read some people complain about the falling of the fibers, I haven&#x27;t had too much trouble with that , but I also found putting a bottom coat of regular mascara on my bottom lashes caught any fall out.. So it wasn&#x27;t ever on my skin. All in all very pleased with this product, couldn&#x27;t ever get these results even with my favorite mascara!!!</li>
    <li> PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! We do not even sell this anymore!!! If you want the real deal go through a Younique presenter like me!!!! You can tell just by looking at the insert that this is FAKE!</li>
    <li> Kind of expensive.... But this is by far the BEST mascara I have ever used in my whole entire life. You can see my eyelashes across the room when I use it.</li>
    <li> I love this product in the sense that initially it does make my short, thin, blonde eye lashes very long.  Only thing......it has a tendency to flake, and it it gets into the eyes easily.</li>
    <li> Looks like im wearing fake eye lashes which is great! No discomfort during the day. I do suggest taking it off at night because the fiber will go in your eyes :)</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this product but it was not all that magical. I can almost get the same results with a mascara I already own. Applying the product over and over to get results is time consuming and the fibers got in my eyes causing some irritation. (And yes I followed the instructions to reapply the gel to set the fibers) I don&#x27;t think I will purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Yucky yucky yucky! It goes everywhere! I have tried it over and over again and it just ends up in more places than your lashes. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Sadly this is counterfeit.  A quick way to tell is the real Younique says Younique LLC and the fake says Younique Products and it doesn&#x27;t work well the fibers flake off on the fake.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara !&lt;br /&gt;Your lash will be thicker and longer</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase. Do leave residue under eye throughout the day. Unsure if it was because I did not apply the product appropriately.</li>
    <li> I am very much enjoy this product</li>
    <li> This is not real Younique mascara. Please visit [...] to purchase genuine Younique products!</li>
    <li> Horrible product. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I love this product just receive it from the company today It&#x27;s working great I love it https://www.youniqueproducts.com</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s look like people want to get this off of Amazon so they say it&#x27;s fake don&#x27;t believe on anything I just received them  from the company direct I bought two pieces for my wife as a gift for July 4  I told them that people say that the 5103  it&#x27;s fake they told me they are changing every year the code  5103 is from 2015  and it&#x27;s real and I have Proof of purchase</li>
    <li> I know many reviews claim to know this product is fake, and that may very well be the case. I have never used younique before, so I have no baseline to compare this product to. I will say, it&#x27;s leaps and bounds better than my typical drugstore brand mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely thickens and lengthens eyelashes. It&#x27;s also a bit complicated, and you have to go slow, and be cautious when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest concern? THE PACKAGING. The case came crushed, either through the shipment or it just was sold that way. The case won&#x27;t close compeltely and it&#x27;s a complete mess. See attached photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future, I&#x27;ll likely seek out a younique consultant to buy from, or directly from their website.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!  This product (the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; one) is completely dried up.  I gave it to my mom as a gift, and she&#x27;d never used it before, so she didn&#x27;t know why it wasn&#x27;t working and she was too embarrassed to tell me that it was horrible. Since the gel one is dried up...the other one with the fibers doesn&#x27;t stay on her lashes and ends up all over her face.  It&#x27;s either a fake, or this selling isn&#x27;t selling for Younique anymore, and has OLD product that she is trying to get rid of it.  Not ok....especially not for the same price as the correct product.  DON&#x27;T BUY!!!</li>
    <li> I got the product but really didn&#x27;t like it I would like gets refund but it what it is</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not all its hyped up to be. It&#x27;s okay but makes your lashes look weird when you see the little fibers on the end going every which way.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My girlfriends thought I had false eyelashes on.... Nice compliment!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister &amp; she loves it! I&#x27;ve tried it, but for me it works almost the same as regular mascara.</li>
    <li> Very dry. It must have been old.</li>
    <li> Product does increase lash size, but the fibers fall below my eyes.  You have to keep wipes on had to continiously wipe black marks from underneath your eye.  Definitely not worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> Only thing the brush to apply the transparent gel the brissles are short and doesn&#x27;t catch the right amount of gel. When applying I had to wipe off extra gel, the first time is trial and error...my lashes look thicker but about the same length.</li>
    <li> I got a fake version...but LOVE IT....... You need to get used to it...it is well worth it..</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It makes my lashes look full and long plus is waterproof! It&#x27;s my new everyday mascara!</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE mascara!!!! I LOVE that it thickens and lengthens my eyelashes like a set of falsies. However I wish the price wasn&#x27;t so high. I would expect to pay $20 for this, not $35.</li>
    <li> Just received this product from company direct and it says 5103 beneath the UPC! This is the original! When buying this product make sure it is written 5103 in the back.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Younique 3D Fiberlash Moodstruck Mascara a month ago.  My lashes are short and so I&#x27;ve always had a hard time getting them to &amp;#34;POP&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve purchased numerous different brands of mascaras only to be disappointed after applying it. I was skeptical about the new mascara by Younique. It was a farely new company but many people were raving about it, so I decided to try it out. I watched the video reviews as well and it showed me how to apply it.  After purchasing it online, I got it in about 5 business days. Came in a really cute, fancy black case.  I even got excited holding the case in my hands. The mascara tubes are sleek looking as well.  I love it! I put it on every single day for like a week. Practicing and mastering it. It seriously looks like I have fake lashes on. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments and my boyfriend loves my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; lashes!  It&#x27;s really fun to apply as well.  It is now the one product I don&#x27;t leave home without..and when I run out..I&#x27;ll be purchasing a new one. It&#x27;s also animal cruelty free which is one more reason to just love it! Thanks Younique for making an awesome mascara. Look forward to trying more of your products. I&#x27;m 100% satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is not authentic Younique mascara.</li>
    <li> You can only buy REAL younique products from a presenter or the website. Our new 3D Fiber lash+ is an improved product with uplift eye serum, to help keep those beautiful lashes nourished and healthy. If you would like to have amazing lashes from an amazing natural product please take a look at my website:&lt;br /&gt;www.youniqueproducts.com/Empoweringwomen&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> If I could leave zero stars I would. This is a mess. It flakes and smudges, don&#x27;t waste you money!!</li>
    <li> My lashes do look thicker using it but it flakes &amp; runs to much.</li>
    <li> I just received my Younique moonstruck 3D fiber lash.😍💋👍🏾👍🏾👏🏽 I&#x27;m in love😍. I followed the directions and my lashes are like WOW!  I&#x27;ve used many mascaras over the years with Dior show blackout being my favorite, well I now have a new favorite 😘. My lashes are magnified and are so lush.  I will order again.👩🏽💅🏽</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t do what I was expecting for it to do for my eyelash length , and it flaked all over my face . I wasn&#x27;t a fan !!</li>
    <li> I loved this product. It does actually make your eye lashes longer and fuller. Would recommend this product for anyone wanting false lashes without the glue. Love, love it</li>
    <li> Just love it , the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fibers get clumped in the container after several uses</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  I&#x27;d been waiting and waiting to try it.  I&#x27;ve looked up several YouTube videos and Facebook posts/videos and no matter what I did, I just couldn&#x27;t get the same (or similar) results.  I use Loreal mascara; I get a much better result at a WAY cheaper price!</li>
