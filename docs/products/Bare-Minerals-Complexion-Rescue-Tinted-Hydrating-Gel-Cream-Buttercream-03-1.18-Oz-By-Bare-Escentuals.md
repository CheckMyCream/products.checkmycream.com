### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Took a chance on the tan color, and it is perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>I am 73 and this is the best .</li>
      <li>Wonderful experience, and</li>
      <li>and I must say that this product is wonderful.</li>
      <li>this product is great.  </li>
      <li>This is great, just like make up but lighter weight</li>
      <li>Very nice product.  </li>
      <li>I loved this.  </li>
      <li>Neutral color has been good as my face tans ( just a bit) during the summer.</li>
      <li>this product is still good but am still on the fence about it.</li>
      <li>but it is good</li>
      <li>ok on the skin&lt;br /&gt;Seller did great</li>
      <li>Great coverage and offers a beautiful glow!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>love this product!</li>
      <li>I was told to warm it between my fingers then apply all over.  </li>
      <li>Best bare mineral product ever!</li>
      <li>it goes on very smooth  and stays on until I wash it off.</li>
      <li>Very light and hydrating.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Since Medium Tan is more neutral, I chose Tan 07, which is also neutral.  </li>
      <li>better then this</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Make sure you buy the applicator brush</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>it in a little,&amp;#34; to blend it better.</li>
      <li>I love bareminerials...</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Was hoping it was more like the garnier bb.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible</li>
      <li>im sure it will be fine in a week or so :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used Laura Mercier&#x27;s oil free tinted moisturizer (LOVE :)</li>
      <li>It did not appear to oxidize, transfer, or rub off after a full day without touching up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The real irony was that when I arrived, she had commented that I had nice skin and asked whether I was wearing any makeup -- because my MUCH cheaper Garnier bb cream blended perfectly and looked completely natural.</li>
      <li>Light coverage.  </li>
      <li>For reference, I use Medium Tan in the original foundation, and Tan 1 in the concealer.</li>
      <li>My only hope is that as it becomes more popular, BE will introduce additional shades - perhaps a Medium Tan.</li>
      <li>texture of this one is cool and gel-like.</li>
      <li>so when you put it on your face you feel like it dries up to quickly to spread it all over almost.</li>
      <li>I can layer it for more coverage, such as an evening look.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>wish I wasn&#x27;t so dark, but with the warm weather comes sun and sun means tanning</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>its ok like other brands...</li>
      <li>but after a few hours it &amp;#34;settles in&amp;#34; and looks better.</li>
      <li>Not too heavy, not too light.  </li>
      <li>I had it color-matched and applied by a professional.</li>
      <li>I use a brush to lightly apply this to half of my face at a time, applying to eye area last.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals for 10 years</li>
      <li>I find that if I apply it with damp NOT wet hands</li>
      <li>When I commented on how heavy and greasy it looked, the person who applied it first said that it was because she&#x27;d used a brush to apply it, creating a glossier finish, and she&#x27;d just &amp;#34;press</li>
      <li>the extra moisture in it makes it look heavy at first</li>

<li> I applied with nothing on my dry but acne-prone skin and it felt like a dream.</li>
<li> and I was unable to find many helpful reviews (other than from people who sampled the product).&lt;br /&gt;So for a little background, I purchased this in Tan 07.</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected.  </li>
<li> It also is not real water</li>
<li> it&#x27;s just not what I expected.</li>
<li> It made me look ten years older by emphasizing every line and pore and had the surface appearance of silly putty.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> due to ingredient &amp;#34;titanium dioxide&amp;#34; tan#7 does not do well on my olive complexion</li>
<li> not worth the price and hype..</li>
<li> Does not settle down in lines.</li>
<li> I apply a little to my hand, swirl the brush in the makeup, and apply.</li>
<li> and I wish it was a little creamier for application</li>
<li> I wanted to write a review since this product was just released a few days ago</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like a heavy make-up, so</li>
<li> Too heavy and didn&#x27;t like the color</li>
<li> I see where some think it is heavy.</li>
<li> but, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll get this again.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s kinda thick</li>
<li> I&#x27;m supposed to spend half of my work day looking like a crone molded in silly putty, while I wait for my moisturizer to &amp;#34;settle in and look better&amp;#34;?  </li>
<li> Seriously?</li>
<li> This was not good did not like it i tryed to returned</li>
<li> When I said that it still looked bad, she came up with another excuse --</li>
<li> but it is very thin.</li>
<li> I feequently use it instead of a make up base.</li>
<li> It still looked horribly plastic.</li>
<li> This is horrible stuff!</li>

    <li> Best bare mineral product ever!</li>
    <li> I Like the product but it is very thin. It also is not real water proof.&lt;br /&gt;Feels ok on the skin&lt;br /&gt;Seller did great</li>
    <li> I use a brush to lightly apply this to half of my face at a time, applying to eye area last. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This was not good did not like it i tryed to returned but they wouldnt take it back</li>
    <li> I like it but it doesn&#x27;t stay on for a long time</li>
    <li> Make sure you buy the applicator brush</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals for 10 years and I must say that this product is wonderful. I wanted to write a review since this product was just released a few days ago and I was unable to find many helpful reviews (other than from people who sampled the product).&lt;br /&gt;So for a little background, I purchased this in Tan 07. The salesperson at the boutique actually shade matched me with Spice 08, but I felt it was too warm/gold. For reference, I use Medium Tan in the original foundation, and Tan 1 in the concealer. Since Medium Tan is more neutral, I chose Tan 07, which is also neutral.  I&#x27;ve also used Laura Mercier&#x27;s oil free tinted moisturizer (LOVE :) in Almond.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of this one is cool and gel-like. I was told to warm it between my fingers then apply all over.  I applied with nothing on my dry but acne-prone skin and it felt like a dream. It did not appear to oxidize, transfer, or rub off after a full day without touching up.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! My only hope is that as it becomes more popular, BE will introduce additional shades - perhaps a Medium Tan.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product. Great coverage and offers a beautiful glow!  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Too heavy and didn&#x27;t like the color</li>
    <li> Light coverage.  I feequently use it instead of a make up base.</li>
    <li> due to ingredient &amp;#34;titanium dioxide&amp;#34; tan#7 does not do well on my olive complexion looks like a mask</li>
    <li> Wonderful experience, and I LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected.  No coverage!</li>
    <li> wish I wasn&#x27;t so dark, but with the warm weather comes sun and sun means tanning so im sure it will be fine in a week or so :)</li>
    <li> I loved this.  Took a chance on the tan color, and it is perfect for me.  I don&#x27;t like a heavy make-up, so this product is great.  I can layer it for more coverage, such as an evening look.  Definitely get the brush!  I apply a little to my hand, swirl the brush in the makeup, and apply.</li>
    <li> not worth the price and hype..its ok like other brands...rather I found  L&#x27;oreal better then this</li>
    <li> I really like it I just wish it was easier to pick a shade and I wish it was a little creamier for application</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Gives your complexion a little glow, your skin looks vibrant</li>
    <li> This is horrible stuff! I had it color-matched and applied by a professional. It made me look ten years older by emphasizing every line and pore and had the surface appearance of silly putty. When I commented on how heavy and greasy it looked, the person who applied it first said that it was because she&#x27;d used a brush to apply it, creating a glossier finish, and she&#x27;d just &amp;#34;press it in a little,&amp;#34; to blend it better. It still looked horribly plastic.

The real irony was that when I arrived, she had commented that I had nice skin and asked whether I was wearing any makeup -- because my MUCH cheaper Garnier bb cream blended perfectly and looked completely natural. Expensive isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Did not concile but it is good</li>
    <li> I like this foundation.  Not too heavy, not too light.  Neutral color has been good as my face tans ( just a bit) during the summer.</li>
    <li> I love bareminerials...this product is still good but am still on the fence about it. It&#x27;s a very sheer coverage and it&#x27;s kinda thick so when you put it on your face you feel like it dries up to quickly to spread it all over almost. It&#x27;s not terrible it&#x27;s just not what I expected. Was hoping it was more like the garnier bb. Was trying to not use that one anymore and was wanting to use all bareminerals product for my face but, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll get this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very light and hydrating. Does not settle down in lines.</li>
    <li> This is great, just like make up but lighter weight</li>
    <li> I purchased this in spice and I love it. I see where some think it is heavy. I find that if I apply it with damp NOT wet hands it goes on very smooth  and stays on until I wash it off. I just now ordered it in tan as I feel as summer comes I will want a darker shade. I also purchased the cleanser. I have been using both and have noticed a big improvement in my skin.I am 73 and this is the best .</li>
