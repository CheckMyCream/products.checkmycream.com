<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best lotion out there and got it for a great price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion, not amazing !</li>
    <li> This product is really good and my skin loves it. Must buy for women who have dry skin and need something effective. Smells divine too.</li>
    <li> have used it many times, no complaints...</li>
    <li> I bought this because there was a $2.00 off coupon and I&#x27;m happy I did. It smells nice, is not greasy (like the body butter I have).  It was absorbed right away and makes my dry skin feel softer.  The pump is great and it&#x27;s a big bottle, what a good deal!</li>
    <li> Using for legs and elbows.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Great Deal with the coupon that was included on this purchase.  Amazon has made a lot of things cheaper and easier!  Nivea is a great brand and their extended moisture body lotion is a great product.  My skin feels great after I use it,  Goes on smooth and never feels sticky!</li>
    <li> Cures my dry winter skin. Great for the price and beats expensive lotions</li>
    <li> very good consistency of lotion- way more lasting than thinner ones but the idea that it lasts any longer than any other hand lotion would be untrue. they ALL wash off when you wash your hands</li>
    <li> This body lotion works great!  Also love the fact that it is much cheaper than the ones out there.  Will keep using them!</li>
    <li> very nice product, I would buy again</li>
    <li> Nivea products are always great. Lotion is rich and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
    <li> I love everything there is about this lotion from the brand, the smell and how smooth it keeps my skin.. Ops I almost forgot to add I especially love it becasue I have dry sensitive skin and it keeps it from itching and being dry...  Kudos...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Nivea products, but I think over the years they&#x27;ve perfected their formula super well--this Extended moisture lotion is PERFECT for my dry skin but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or unpleasant to put on at all.  One of my favorite parts of the morning is now looking forward to putting this on after my shower and having soft, supple skin for hours after!</li>
    <li> Love Nivea. It&#x27;s my go to moisturizer. Makes my skin incredibly soft.</li>
    <li> Classic moisturizer...no frills, but fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope, this doesn&#x27;t have sparkles, self-tanner, heavy fragrance in it.  It&#x27;s a basic well-made moisturizer that does it&#x27;s job.  I love the thick cream and the fact that the pump puts out a decent amount without banging it forty times. This type of moisturizer is hard to find: at Target I went up and down the aisle trying to find just a good basic lotion that didn&#x27;t have other stuff added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swim and the pool strips the moisturizer out of my skin regularly. This puts it back on.  I don&#x27;t notice an odor at all, it seems fragrance free.  Really love this product!</li>
    <li> I like this more than the other Nivea that&#x27;s in a blue bottle.  This smells better and lighter I guess than the other one.  I&#x27;m not sure about the 48-hours though.  I usually apply lotion twice a day, maybe because it&#x27;s winter my skin is drier.</li>
    <li> Great hydration for skin, not sticky, great smell.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this works in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have liked a lot of Nivea products and so does my wife but this is terrible.  It is average as lotion but has a sickeningly sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it and threw it out.</li>
    <li> All my family used it for years it moisturize your hold body it go deep and left you radiant and beautiful</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion my husband liked. He has sensitive skin and he said it feels good on the skin without being greasy.</li>
    <li> my favorite lotion.  Not too sticky.</li>
    <li> Greatest moisturizer ever for body! It keeps my skin hydrated, soft and smooth like baby skin in 25 hours. Smell really nice! I love it!</li>
    <li> Skin literally sticks together.</li>
    <li> I really love how rich and thick this is.  I wish they would offer it with a lavender fragrance, the Nivea fragrance is not all that pleasant.  The good thing is the smell disappears pretty quickly and the lotion is close to being the best lotion out there.</li>
    <li> Not as good as silky smooth</li>
    <li> feels good, although it contains paraben</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, I too suffer from very dry skin in winter.  I get dry patches that look red after a shower.  I&#x27;ve tried slathering on other moisturizers like Cetaphil, even used Vaseline petro jelly, would still have dry skin.  This stuff works.  My skin is soft, stays soft all day, and my red patches are gone.  It succeeded where others failed.  The scent I thought was quite nice, and not overpowering at all.  Certainly smells better than Gold Bond (which I also tried).</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> When did American produced Nivea become so obnoxious smelling? I&#x27;ve used this cream a few times on my arms and legs. Whatever is in this stuff is chemical smelling and waifs up to my eyes making them water and burn. For me, this went right into the trash. I&#x27;m going back to the blue tin Nivea produced in Germany.</li>
    <li> The product is fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best Nivea lotion we have used.  My girlfriend loves this stuff and she knows her lotions.  Its a great every day lotion feels thick without a overpowering scent and keeps our skin from drying out in our dry Colorado air.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a clean, fresh smell and goes on smoothly without any greasy feeling. I use it several times a day. My hands are soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Good price not very expensive</li>
    <li> I use a lot of body lotion, especially in the winter, so I&#x27;m always looking for a long-lasting, budget-friendly solution. This lotion is amazing! This goes on smoothly with no greasy after-feel, and a little bit goes a long way - something else my budget appreciates! The lotion lasted all day long, even through a rainstorm. My skin felt hydrated and happy all day long. I even like the scent - it&#x27;s fresh, clean and not over-powering at all.&lt;br /&gt;This is a new beauty cabinet staple. And I love that I can save even more with Subscribe &amp; Save!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great but WOW the perfumey smell is overwhelming.....yuk.  It does dissipate after awhile, but it is too strong.  Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> So much richness and hydration. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> First off, I hate that lotion can be oily &amp; greasy &amp; sticky. The fact that I like this lotion says a LOT. I also have to wash my hands a lot due to my type of work and my hands get dry a lot. This is the first lotion that can heal my hands overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second best I&#x27;ve used was Vaseline Hand &amp; Nail (I don&#x27;t care about the nail part, but it healed my hands the best). This is definitely useful along the lines of that, and works well. It&#x27;s rated as half way between light and rich, and I&#x27;d agree with that. It doesn&#x27;t have that sticky grippy feel after you rub it in. It&#x27;s a smooth slick feel, but more toward waxy and less toward greasy.</li>
    <li> I love the Nivea creams, so did not returned the item.&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself excellent and does the job, I just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I have tried what seems like hundreds of lotions. This one is such a keeper. I have dry skin mainly on my legs and this is just a dream. No crazy strong smells, absorbs quickly, and I love the pump. Also, I have tattoos and get tattooed often and have had no problems at all with using this on fresh tattoos. I have many backups :)</li>
    <li> One of my favorite lotions ever!  Moisturizes very well! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> So I went out on a limb and purchased this lotion and I am happily surprised!! It smells great too! A+</li>
    <li> Great protection for dry skin, no smell and smooths on nicely.  Look forward to moisturizing my skin with it.  Love Nivea brands - glad I found it.</li>
    <li> thanks you really did good job good product ....thanks</li>
    <li> This is my go-to body lotion.  I don&#x27;t wash my whole body every day and the claims for this lotion lasting 48 hours are true!  This lotion rubs in easily and is not greasy.  It isn&#x27;t a thick cream, but the moisture lasts.  I have sensitive skin and have had reactions to fragrances and chemicals in some lotions.  I have never experienced any negative side affects from this lotion; only soft, flake-free skin.  In fact I like this so much, it is on my Subscription list.</li>
    <li> Great product,Im a 40 year customer.</li>
    <li> Keep the skin really smooth</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion ever! I&#x27;ve tried so many. Most lotions you have to reapply during the day. This one you don&#x27;t. Makes your skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> It smells and feels good on my skin. I love it! And I got it at a great price! Win win for me! Lol!</li>
    <li> Best lotion, great smell and consistency.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so smooth, soaks in very well... I love nivea!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I have the great fortune of having dry skin and living in a desert. This winter was especially rough on my skin and I needed something that worked and also didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling gross. I use this everywhere including my face and it&#x27;s great. My skin feels so much better.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It is light but moisturizes great.</li>
    <li> Love it just purely love this product. I use this product cause my skin is very dry. I have try other product but this one does the job. The extended moisture is added plus. this product was recommended by my family</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  I like the smell that is not too strong and also it provides moistrue for the dry skin.  I definitely will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Perhaps a decent option in summer. But for the Winter dryness Curel Ultra Healing is what I reach for. Well worth the price difference for a superior product</li>
    <li> Fair price with great quality !!! This lotion does a good job in moisturizing my skin :) I like it !</li>
    <li> great transaction just as described</li>
    <li> I use this this product all the time and swear it does help my bad dry skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Thick &amp; able to stand up to the indoor dryness of heating, and the cold winds of winter. Even so, it absorbs well and is mostly non-greasy unless you slather it on dry skin.  It seems to work best fresh out of the shower, and applied in thin layers.&lt;br /&gt;It soaks in quickly and soothes irritated skin, while moisturizing and plumping even the driest, crispiest skin.&lt;br /&gt;I had the flu and my whole face was red, raw, and even more sensitive than usual, and though for a moment I thought the lotion was going to burn, it just tingled a tiny bit for maybe three seconds, and went straight to soothing and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;It smells very nice, but does not set off my allergies as nearly everything else does.&lt;br /&gt;It is reasonably priced for the quality of it, and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This lotion worked perfectly for me while I was pregnant.  I had really sensitive skin and it helped with my mild eczema.</li>
    <li> I love my Nivea lotion.I will not use any others lotion.My skin is so soft to touch and baby smooth.</li>
    <li> Nice product to have and to use on daily basis.</li>
    <li> My fiancé loves thus lotion and stole it from me. I&#x27;ll be buYing one to take to work now!</li>
    <li> my wife got dry skin and this thing keeps her skin moist at night. The scent is unmistakably f eminent.</li>
    <li> The bottle of the body lotion was broken when it was arrived. The lotion itself is thin, not rich. You feel dry again a few minutes after applying it on your skin.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite lotion for the winter.  I get very dry skin, which gets flaky if I don&#x27;t work at keeping it moisturized during the winter.  I knew that I needed to replace my regular lotion (St. Ives Collagen formula) for the winter, and decided to give this a whirl.  I&#x27;m so glad that I did.  It is my FAVORITE new product I&#x27;ve tried in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOISTURE:  This is very moisturizing, though not as thick or rich as creams can get.  Nivea classifies this as a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; lotion, which is probably right.  It&#x27;s much richer than most of the lightweight lotions I&#x27;ve bought in drugstores, but it&#x27;s not as rich as, say, the Eucerin tubs.  Personally, I find this is just right:  I don&#x27;t have to reapply constantly (like I do with lighter lotions), and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy (like with thicker lotions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCENT:  I really, really like this scent.  It has a light smell that is kind of spicy.  There&#x27;s nothing sweet or flowery about this, so I&#x27;d think that men might prefer this lotion to a lot of others on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VALUE:  I&#x27;ve been applying this lotion 1-2 times per day, and usually need about 4-5 pumps to cover my skin head-to-toe.  The bottle is still about 3/4 full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> Nivea creame always does a great job in winter.</li>
    <li> This lotion works like none other when it comes to quick absorption. I typically use it under a dry oil for extra protection. I keep it as my hg body product.</li>
    <li> love this lotion, feels so good</li>
    <li> This lotion is exceptional - the lotion bottle never arrives intact making it extremely hard to pump.  I had to go out to the store in order to buy another bottle to have an extra pump.  This is only good as a replacement if you have the pump from a previous purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I have extremely dry skin and using this lotion daily has helped to bring moisture back into my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use the blue bottle Essentially Enriched Nivea in the past which is very oily and for very dry skin as well.  Bought this one only because it was on sale but ended up really liking it. Better than the blue bottle. This one applies very smoothly and has a wonderful texture that&#x27;s moisturizing and rich but not too oily.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent.  It&#x27;s kind of odd and not very refreshing, yet it&#x27;s unique and has grown on me.</li>
    <li> extended moisture - perfectly describes what it provides.</li>
    <li> I have only used this with combination with Nivea Smooth Sensation Body Lotion, and it have improved my skin condition!</li>
    <li> best body lotion in the market and for the price.. its a steal . I have subscribed .</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion. will buy agian</li>
    <li> Keeping my skin from looking like a cracked desert.  It is a brutal winter this year, and in my 60s,  I have skin that is looking old and dries out fast.  I can tell if I haven&#x27;t used this.  There are spots so dry I can feel it hit, and soak in.  Using it on my face is actually helping when I need to go out and face the bitter cold to shovel/remove snow.&lt;br /&gt;I like it so well - I feel it is actually working so well! - that I have put it on automatic delivery on  Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> The is some of, if not, the best lotion I have ever used. I have EXTREMELY dry skin and it seems this is the best I have tried. It doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, absorbs quickly and smells clean and not overbearing. Even my husband has started using it. And he HATES lotion</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this lotion! It makes my skin super soft like no other lotion I have used before, and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> moisture, good for dairy use after shower.</li>
    <li> When you have a coupon to clip and a subscribe and save option, what&#x27;s not to like. However don&#x27;t expect premium results and claims about &amp;#34;ultra-lasting formula&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;makes skin soft&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;dermatologist approved&amp;#34; should be taken with a pinch of salt !!</li>
    <li> I love every lotion I had own from Nivea this one is no exception. Is perfect for my husband since he constantly wash his hand keeps his hands moisturized .</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Great price compared to Walgreens and Walmart.</li>
    <li> A favorite of my lady. She works long hours some days  and I use this product to supply the perfect foot massage. A secondary plus is very soft feet.</li>
    <li> ive used this for years and its a good lotion for dry skin. its cheap enough and gets the job done.the smell is pleasent and applies okay. the otion is a bit oily, but once you rub it in good, the oily feel is dispersed and dried. its lasts a long time too. great product!</li>
    <li> Great value and the product meets my expectations.  For me this is about a 1 year supply and Nivea makes a good product.  I will use this vendor and product again.  By the way.....I prefer using Nivea products because of the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;m</li>
    <li> This is a very good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Good product. Smells nice and lasts quite longer. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> got for Christmas stocking stuffers.  I am sure it will be great</li>
    <li> Good even moisture that lasts through the day on dry itchy skin - I just with it was fragrance free or had a lighter fragrance as it is noticible enough to clash with what I am wearing.</li>
    <li> Love all Nivea products.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion and the deal i got.. Very sad that the pump broke in transit</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this as many people mentioned how they love the smell.  I don&#x27;t like lotions with a strong scent and was unsure if I would like this.  This is by far the best body lotion I have used.  The smell is very light and nice, it&#x27;s hard to describe the scent - not perfume, not floral, not fruity or sweet - just a nice simple scent.  The lotion is easy to blend, not too thick but dense enough to soften your skin.  I may never purchase another lotion again.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This lotion moisturize your skin and locks it in for over 24 hours. Very good lotion for the winter months when your skin  dries out a lot. This lotion keeps my skin moisturize in winter and for  $2.89 it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Good product for sensitive skin. Not greasy and keeps skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing. Better than anything I&#x27;ve used for winter skin dryness.</li>
    <li> Smooth Skin!&lt;br /&gt;Great Moisture body lotion that last. I love the way it makes my skin feel! It isn&#x27;t grease like a few other&#x27;s I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I have found it very moisturizing for my aged  skin....I buy it less costly, tho</li>
    <li> This is also an excellent choice.  I once worked for a company who making this product.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> We love Nivea for body lotion, best bang for the buck. We live in Wisconsin and use about 6 bottles of Nivea lotion every winter.</li>
    <li> Depenable Nivea quality at a great price at time of purchase.  Nice to have this for dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, I ordered 3 more.  It is not greasy and feels very silky when you apply it.  Nivea used to be greasy but I guess they have improved the formula and it really feels good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many different brands of lotions (Avon, Aveeno, Body Butter, Palmers, etc.) to relieve my extra dry skin. Neither was able to fully moisturize my skin or last long enough to keep the ash away. I remembered using Nivea (blue bottle) years ago &amp; wanted to give it another try. But, I saw this 48 hr extended lotion &amp; decided to get it instead of the original. This lotion works wonders on my skin especially after a shower! I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin not  becoming ashy after a couple hours at work...particularly on my elbows. The smell is nice &amp; subtle, not overpowering. It goes on quick and easy without leaving any residue or stickiness. And it stops itchiness. Plus the cost is cheaper than some of those other brands in the local stores. I will definitely continue to use this lotion.</li>
    <li> I tried this one and i really like this moisturiser .</li>
    <li> This lotion is thick, moisturizing and great for dry skin.  It tends to last quite a while on the skin and has helped itchiness.  The scent is slight so the lotion is ok for men, too!</li>
    <li> GREAT LOTION..GREAT PRICE.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this! Makes my skin soft, shiny, super smooth and a crisp scent i am in love.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for those of us who do not care to apply lotion on several times a day, especially during the winter. It&#x27;s not too thick, but not watered down either. I know some do not care for too much oil, but this appears to has just the right amount. It is not as thick as other brands, but great for dailty use.  For the best results, I use it right after a bath or shower.  The scent is not overwhelming and suitable for the whole family.</li>
    <li> Too rich and takes a long time to dry</li>
    <li> Love the hydration and smell. The first time I used it was in Europe many moons ago. It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s reasonably priced available in the US now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one in the car, at work and multiple bottles around the house since I have severely dry skin. Holds up great in Florida summer heat!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this a few weeks ago and liked it and finally bought a bottle.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  It actually absorbs into the skin, it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top like the zillions of other bottles of lotion I have.  It&#x27;s light, has a nice scent, and it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky.  I&#x27;m sold on it.</li>
    <li> Although the moisturizer works fine, the extreme fragrance is overwhelming. Nivea seems to do that for most of their products.</li>
    <li> Love the smell!!! Great lotion - worked wonders on my dry flakey skin. Not too oily or greasy. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I need lotion to keep my heels from cracking (karate/running). This was available on a good sale so I decided to try it. The scent is great, it&#x27;s mild and fresh - not girly at all. A little goes a long way too, I&#x27;ll probably stay with this lotion.</li>
    <li> Great thick lotion for winter. Im allergic to most smells and this is super mild!!!</li>
    <li> this is a miracle lotion i usually get really bad dry skin and hate using thick or oily lotions but this is really nice light weight and not greasy at all and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I think this lotion leaves a considerable greasy feeling and I still need to reapply just a few hours later.</li>
    <li> It lasts a long time, and you don&#x27;t have to apply each time you wash your hands. There is nothing quite like it that I have found!</li>
    <li> Works well on dry skin</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizing lotion...leaves skin very soft ans moist. Great price!</li>
    <li> Great product and customer service</li>
    <li> This lotion has done well to ward off the inevitable dry-skin cracking that I develop every winter, which is what I need it to do. Some reviewers complain about the smell and I would agree the scent is more perfume-like than I prefer. That said, it smells like other lotions I&#x27;ve tried for intense moisturizing: it smells like lotion. For me, it is a bit greasy after application.</li>
    <li> Nivea Extended Moisture Body Lotion seemed to work well, for the week or so I used it.  But the fragrance is far too strong - I can smell it while I sit at my desk at work, and I&#x27;m sure others can smell it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not unpleasant, it is not especially pleasant either.  And even though I&#x27;ve switched to other lotions, the smell is still in some of the dry-clean-only clothes I wore.</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best moisturizer I have ever used. Here in AZ humidity is very low and skin gets really dry. Daily application has worked a treat</li>
    <li> Too thick.  Just don&#x27;t like this much goop on my skin.  Stay with Original.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.  I use every day especially during winter.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer I ever had. It&#x27;s said 48 hours and yes it stays there for 48 hrs unless take bath with soap. Every penny worth. Smells good,  not over scent.&lt;br /&gt;I use this as full body moisturizer and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is not really a dry. But if you have dry skin it will works for a day at least. It&#x27;s rich cream and also great for face.</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite lotion.  Light scent, so I can wear it to work with all of the sensitive noses, but so very moisturizing.  Makes my skin feel like silk! I wash my hands about 5 times a day, so this really helps sooth my super dry skin,</li>
