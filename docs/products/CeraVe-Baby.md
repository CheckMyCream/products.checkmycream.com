### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Aside from a diaper rash cream, I&#x27;ve found this product to be a wonderful hand moisturizer as well!</li>
      <li>Babies get all of the best products!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was very happy with the texture and consistency of the product.</li>
      <li>All in all an excellent product!</li>
      <li>This cream is awesome, because it&#x27;s lightweight like lotion</li>
      <li>This really is an impressive product.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the best diaper rash treatments I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I have been using CeraVe products for years, and this is another great product by them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great product to help keep you moisturized.</li>
      <li>what&#x27;s great is it can be used for both that and for adults who just want nice moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really liked this cream.</li>
      <li>A nice diaper rash cream to heal diaper rash and to prevent it also.</li>
      <li>Those are kind of hit &amp; miss.  </li>
      <li>To be honest it didn&#x27;t help at all after 2 days.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer stung her face, too, so I tried it on my own face and it stung my skin, too.</li>
      <li>It honestly doesn&#x27;t have a scent at all.</li>
      <li>It is an excellent product that does seem to truly promote quick healing at the FIRST sign of diaper rash.</li>
      <li>this morning his bottom looks way better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok hand lotion, though.</li>
      <li>so you do not end up with more than you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Many years ago I discovered the truth.</li>
      <li>Okay, I&#x27;m 81 and have need of the Depends products.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is comparable to dr smiths, way better than Burt&#x27;s bees and babyganics.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it works to prevent diaper rash.</li>
      <li>We have had a summer that is more humid than normal this year, so I am very appreciative of having this on hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It sounded like a good product, so I was interested in testing it out.</li>
      <li>My baby liked the cream and it seemed to cool any rash he had.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite things about this diaper rash cream is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like Desitin</li>
      <li>As a nurse I wash my hands all the time at work and this is about the best product out there for dry irritated</li>
      <li>It seems like a much more gentle diaper rash cream, but it still does a good job of providing a barrier of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>but it was fine.</li>
      <li>This cream is excellent on adult skin that is sensitive and prone to rash and dryness.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
      <li>As a moisture barrier, this is on the light side but fully acceptable/appropriate for a baby&#x27;s tender skin.  </li>
      <li>He couldn&#x27;t get comfortable, and he cried and grabbed at his diaper.</li>
      <li>We like that this cream is sulfate and paraben free which can irritate baby&#x27;s tender skin.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, has no annoying scent and has a continuous moisturizing effect.</li>
      <li>Works well and is fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>It turns out to be useful for more than just baby -</li>
      <li>Additionally, it cleared up his rash quickly, and it was easy to apply.</li>
      <li>This CeraVe Baby Diaper Rash Cream is a very good for both baby and adult sensitive skin that needs protecting.</li>
      <li>I can personally attest that this diaper rash cream is good stuff.  </li>
      <li>My baby isn&#x27;t overly prone to diaper rash but he does get redness here and there that I like to cut off at the pass before it can turn into a full blown rash.</li>
      <li>Anyway, the CeraVe costs more than Desitin, but it really does cool the burn.  </li>
      <li>It relieves the redness on his bottom quickly and with no adverse effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a lansinoh fan, I&#x27;m super upset that you can&#x27;t find it</li>
      <li>It was a soft cream and rubbed in very easily and without noticeable residue.</li>
      <li>This is very gentle and non-scented, which is a huge plus since this is going in places where that adds no value at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really like that this washes off easily as well so as not to irritate tender skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First of all, it DOESN&#x27;T STING!  </li>
      <li>Paraben and phthalate free, most of the chemicals in it are of low toxicity.</li>
      <li>, I have tried several different brands of diaper rash creams to alleviate this problem and they all seem to do a good job, but the CeraVe does a better job than the others.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had some contact dermatitis on my ring finger for months and it cleared it right up, as well as a heat rash that my son got on the inside elbow.</li>
      <li>This seems to keep things out of control better than Baby Butt Aid and regular baby powder.  </li>
      <li>like that this really is not greasy at all and absorbs nicely into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>stuff is pretty</li>
      <li>While he does cry with most creams I put on him, he stops as soon as I strap his diaper back on.</li>
      <li>This Diaper Rash Cream was exactly what we needed.  </li>
      <li>However, I love their facial lotion PM, so I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re putting in these products that isn&#x27;t in the PM lotion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it&#x27;s not that big, it seems like a lot more.</li>
      <li>It goes very smooth and it is effective in calming red areas due to the diaper rash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It was super thick and seemed to provide a good barrier between my child&#x27;s skin and the wetness of the diaper.</li>
      <li>It has a very light smell, not really noticeable unless you put your hand right up to your nose and smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So it is a good solution for first signs of diaper rash, but in my experience not appropriate once the diaper rash has progressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;We believe that this wash is even more gentle that our current J&amp;J as it contains sulfate</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>However, it handles much better than similarly formulated creams - it soaks right into the skin and provides lasting protection.</li>
      <li>If you have never tried it, diaper rash cream works very well for adult heat rash - especially in those more sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>would highly recommend you try this if you&#x27;re looking for something comparable to dr. Smiths or a replacement for lansinoh diaper cream.</li>
      <li>I would recommended it highly.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;d clean out baby&#x27;s bottom, dry it, and apply this cream to prevent rashes from developing.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product because it is easy to apply, no strong odor, absorbs well and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>The container is nice and allows yo to take a very small amount at a time</li>
      <li>Plus the sweat, dirt and constant friction causes this to happen, and it can get pretty sore.  </li>
      <li>hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrific product for those adults willing to think outside the box and try a cream labeled for babies.</li>
      <li>and it dries completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is even free of phthalates, parabens and sulfates commonly found in most other wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are higher strength products you can buy (this is only 1% Zinc and Dimethicone), but this works well as advertised for babies or for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t clear up my daughters rash at all.</li>
      <li>children tend to have sensitive skin, so I like that this is gentle enough to use on them without irritation.</li>
      <li>Their adult face wash also stings my skin.</li>
      <li>like the scent (gentle, but not to &amp;#34;baby-ish for my use), and it not only soothes, but it rubs in well.</li>
      <li>I really like the CeraVe and can personally vouch for it.</li>
      <li>My youngest son has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>and he&#x27;s had some issues with diaper rashes early on.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an ICU nurse and frequently deal with skin issues.  </li>
      <li>We have a lot of problems with dry skin and this really helped.</li>
      <li>I was amazed to discover that I&#x27;m far from being the only adult using this baby product.  </li>
      <li>This product goes on clear so there is no white residue.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t clear up my diaper rash, but it did help immensely with my heat rash!</li>
      <li>It is the consistency of a thick, emollient hand lotion but provides nice surface protection (without being too thick/sticky like other related products).  </li>
      <li>We like this gentle baby wash and shampoo for our little girl as it has vitamins and 3 essential ceramides to help repair skin barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> it is like moisturizer with zinc, for me it  makes not enough barrier , because it quickly sinks to the skin what could be a plus, because it doesn&#x27;t leave residue, but it depends on purpose for using that cream, for baby&#x27;s it must be very delicate and easy to spread.</li>
<li> I found out the hard way that the Desitin I had used on both of my babies stings when first applied.  </li>
<li> I vowed never  to put it on his sensitive little backside again.</li>
<li> Was out of diaper rash cream and gave this a try since my baby had a red irritation on his bottom due to constipation.</li>
<li> so you don&#x27;t get this big gush of cream and have to wipe half of it off on a paper towel.  </li>
<li> Sometimes diaper rash happens even with parents diligently changing wet or soiled diapers.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It helps to prevent diaper rash, but once your little one have it, it does nothing</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t clear up my daughters rash at all. I used it for 3 days with no improvement on my baby&#x27;s bum so I switched to a different brand and it clears up her rash overnight.</li>
    <li> This really is an impressive product.  I&#x27;m an ICU nurse and frequently deal with skin issues.  As a moisture barrier, this is on the light side but fully acceptable/appropriate for a baby&#x27;s tender skin.  It is the consistency of a thick, emollient hand lotion but provides nice surface protection (without being too thick/sticky like other related products).  I really like that this washes off easily as well so as not to irritate tender skin.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is nil aside from the intrinsic odors from the ingredients and it dries completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
    <li> Many years ago I discovered the truth. Babies get all of the best products! If you have never tried it, diaper rash cream works very well for adult heat rash - especially in those more sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent (gentle, but not to &amp;#34;baby-ish for my use), and it not only soothes, but it rubs in well.

Five stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lansinoh fan, I&#x27;m super upset that you can&#x27;t find it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is comparable to dr smiths, way better than Burt&#x27;s bees and babyganics. There&#x27;s no smell so that&#x27;s a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend you try this if you&#x27;re looking for something comparable to dr. Smiths or a replacement for lansinoh diaper cream.</li>
    <li> Sometimes diaper rash happens even with parents diligently changing wet or soiled diapers.  This Diaper Rash Cream was exactly what we needed.  We&#x27;d clean out baby&#x27;s bottom, dry it, and apply this cream to prevent rashes from developing.  We like that this cream is sulfate and paraben free which can irritate baby&#x27;s tender skin.  It is easy to apply.  A small amount goes a long ways to help seal out moisture to treat or prevent rashes.</li>
    <li> A nice diaper rash cream to heal diaper rash and to prevent it also. The cream is hypoallergenic and has no fragrance. My baby liked the cream and it seemed to cool any rash he had. I&#x27;m glad it works to prevent diaper rash. That makes me feel safer and the baby happier.</li>
    <li> My youngest son has extremely sensitive skin. When he&#x27;s teething, as hard as we try, we can&#x27;t seem to keep his diapers changed enough to prevent diaper rash. He&#x27;s always cried when we put diaper rash cream on his bottom, so we&#x27;ve tried different creams in hopes to find one that didn&#x27;t seem to hurt him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this cream twice before feeling so horrible I vowed never  to put it on his sensitive little backside again. While he does cry with most creams I put on him, he stops as soon as I strap his diaper back on. He hops up and run around as if nothing was ever wrong. With this cream, it seemed to burn him horribly. He couldn&#x27;t get comfortable, and he cried and grabbed at his diaper. (In hindsight, I really do feel horrible for even trying a second time!) I can&#x27;t describe how in pain my little guy seemed to be with this cream. I was surprised, because I thought it was for sensitive skin, but something in there caused a bad reaction to my son&#x27;s bottom!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite things about this diaper rash cream is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like Desitin does. It honestly doesn&#x27;t have a scent at all. It&#x27;s not greasy. It&#x27;s very lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens or sulfates. It seems like a much more gentle diaper rash cream, but it still does a good job of providing a barrier of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My children tend to have sensitive skin, so I like that this is gentle enough to use on them without irritation.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try CarVe Baby Diaper Rash Cream via the Amazon Vine program. It sounded like a good product, so I was interested in testing it out. It turns out to be useful for more than just baby - I&#x27;ve had some contact dermatitis on my ring finger for months and it cleared it right up, as well as a heat rash that my son got on the inside elbow. Paraben and phthalate free, most of the chemicals in it are of low toxicity. However, it handles much better than similarly formulated creams - it soaks right into the skin and provides lasting protection. I can attest to this as I am somewhat of a compulsive handwasher.</li>
    <li> My baby isn&#x27;t overly prone to diaper rash but he does get redness here and there that I like to cut off at the pass before it can turn into a full blown rash. I really like this product because it is easy to apply, no strong odor, absorbs well and is not greasy. It relieves the redness on his bottom quickly and with no adverse effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from a diaper rash cream, I&#x27;ve found this product to be a wonderful hand moisturizer as well! All in all an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Was out of diaper rash cream and gave this a try since my baby had a red irritation on his bottom due to constipation. To be honest it didn&#x27;t help at all after 2 days. Last night we bought our usual aveeno diaper rash cream and this morning his bottom looks way better.</li>
    <li> I was amazed to discover that I&#x27;m far from being the only adult using this baby product.  Okay, I&#x27;m 81 and have need of the Depends products.  I therefore am subject to rash and thankfully get immediate relief with the CeraVe Baby Diaper Rash Cream.  I do recommend this highly to those unfortunate oldsters like myself.</li>
    <li> The review is for CeraVe diaper rash cream. This cream is awesome, because it&#x27;s lightweight like lotion and it is not sticky and pasty. It goes very smooth and it is effective in calming red areas due to the diaper rash.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant if it will work because of the different texture but it was fine. A little goes long way.</li>
    <li> This CeraVe Baby Diaper Rash Cream is a very good for both baby and adult sensitive skin that needs protecting. This is very gentle and non-scented, which is a huge plus since this is going in places where that adds no value at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this really is not greasy at all and absorbs nicely into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> I really liked this cream. It was super thick and seemed to provide a good barrier between my child&#x27;s skin and the wetness of the diaper. Additionally, it cleared up his rash quickly, and it was easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I have been using CeraVe Diaper rash cream fro about a month on 3 little diapered butts. It is an excellent product that does seem to truly promote quick healing at the FIRST sign of diaper rash. It is easy to apply. However, compared to thick desitin / butt paste, CeraVe Diaper Rash Cream does not really offer protectant. Desitin / Butt Paste and the like provide protection against moistness allowing broken down skin to heal. CeraVe does not offer this protection. So it is a good solution for first signs of diaper rash, but in my experience not appropriate once the diaper rash has progressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to apply, not as goopy as the pastes&lt;br /&gt;-Heals diaper rash quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-Minimal skin protection from moisture&lt;br /&gt;-As a result, not as helpful as the pastes once skin breakdown begins</li>
    <li> it is like moisturizer with zinc, for me it  makes not enough barrier , because it quickly sinks to the skin what could be a plus, because it doesn&#x27;t leave residue, but it depends on purpose for using that cream, for baby&#x27;s it must be very delicate and easy to spread.</li>
    <li> The rash cream stings my baby&#x27;s butt if she is even slightly red. It&#x27;s an ok hand lotion, though. The moisturizer stung her face, too, so I tried it on my own face and it stung my skin, too. Their adult face wash also stings my skin. However, I love their facial lotion PM, so I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re putting in these products that isn&#x27;t in the PM lotion.</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent on adult skin that is sensitive and prone to rash and dryness. I have used it on hands and feet, knees and elbows. It goes on smooth, has no annoying scent and has a continuous moisturizing effect. This product goes on clear so there is no white residue. As a nurse I wash my hands all the time at work and this is about the best product out there for dry irritated hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrific product for those adults willing to think outside the box and try a cream labeled for babies. It does the trick for adults as well.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best diaper rash treatments I&#x27;ve used.  We&#x27;re on our third child and he&#x27;s had some issues with diaper rashes early on.  This seems to keep things out of control better than Baby Butt Aid and regular baby powder.  Those are kind of hit &amp; miss.  This, however, works very well and doesn&#x27;t seem to have any bad aspects as far as ingredients go.</li>
    <li> I can personally attest that this diaper rash cream is good stuff.  I didn&#x27;t get this for a baby&#x27;s diaper rash problem, but for myself!  I do a LOT of hiking and I almost always come home with some sort of chafing rash caused by material rubbing areas of my skin for a prolonged time.  Plus the sweat, dirt and constant friction causes this to happen, and it can get pretty sore.  And I&#x27;m not obese!  It&#x27;s not because of chafing fat folds or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have tried several different brands of diaper rash creams to alleviate this problem and they all seem to do a good job, but the CeraVe does a better job than the others.  First of all, it DOESN&#x27;T STING!  I found out the hard way that the Desitin I had used on both of my babies stings when first applied.  This caused a personal guilt trip, thinking I was helping my babies and instead I had been applying an ointment that stung.....wish i had known.  Anyway, the CeraVe costs more than Desitin, but it really does cool the burn.  And it comes out of the tube in a very small string so you don&#x27;t get this big gush of cream and have to wipe half of it off on a paper towel.  You use all of what you squirt out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also personally used Dr. Sears diaper rash cream and it doesn&#x27;t sting either but it has small hard lumps in it.  I&#x27;ve also got a tube of Beaudreaux&#x27;s butt cream, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  I really like the CeraVe and can personally vouch for it.</li>
    <li> We like this gentle baby wash and shampoo for our little girl as it has vitamins and 3 essential ceramides to help repair skin barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is even free of phthalates, parabens and sulfates commonly found in most other wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We believe that this wash is even more gentle that our current J&amp;J as it contains sulfate and this CeraVe Baby Wash and Shampoo does not.</li>
    <li> I have been using CeraVe products for years, and this is another great product by them. It&#x27;s made as a diaper rash cream, but what&#x27;s great is it can be used for both that and for adults who just want nice moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s not that big, it seems like a lot more. The container is nice and allows yo to take a very small amount at a time so you do not end up with more than you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with the texture and consistency of the product. It was a soft cream and rubbed in very easily and without noticeable residue. It has a very light smell, not really noticeable unless you put your hand right up to your nose and smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product to help keep you moisturized. We have a lot of problems with dry skin and this really helped. I would recommended it highly.</li>
    <li> Works well and is fragrance free.  Goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy.  There are higher strength products you can buy (this is only 1% Zinc and Dimethicone), but this works well as advertised for babies or for people with sensitive skin.  No complaints.</li>
