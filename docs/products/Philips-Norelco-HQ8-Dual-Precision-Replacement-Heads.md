<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As described. Gives a good, clean shave</li>
    <li> It works fine.  Does the job it&#x27; supposed to do.</li>
    <li> The packaging was excellent and delivery was prompt.  The replacement HQ8 heads were new and original and  work fine.  The price was was a real saver compared to retail.</li>
    <li> Working great in my shaver!</li>
    <li> Dropped right in and works well.</li>
    <li> They work... at about the level that my year-old blades did. Looks like I unfortunately got a set that is poor quality, unlike most of the people who have reviewed very positively. I can only think that the workmanship on these varies and is less than standard across the product line. I will soon have to bite the bullet and spend double for the actual Norelco factory blades.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace and works well I replace my heads yearly no complaints</li>
    <li> very good  excellent&lt;br /&gt;, Thanks  and  very  fast  delivery</li>
    <li> AS USUAL, FAST DELIVERY, GOOD VALUE FOR PRICE!</li>
    <li> Norelco suggest a year between changes, I get about 3 months. Maybe it&#x27;s my beard????</li>
    <li> A little costly, but work well.  These were purchased for my Dad who is 82 and doesn&#x27;t want to use a blade any longer and we all feel safer with the electric razor, but thought he blades would last longer.  The ones that came with the razor wore out somewhat quickly.  I guess this is the equivalent of changing individual blade cartridges.</li>
    <li> Best deal is to buy this with subscribe and save so you can get it a lot cheaper than anywhere else.  Else, not much to say about the blades.  They simply work.  Replace as you need them.  I held out for about 1.5 years but probably should have changed at 1 year.  You&#x27;ll know because the shave takes more passes.  Time is money so it&#x27;s well worth spending for a replacement blade.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat buy for my son. Overall good product but a bit on the pricey side.</li>
    <li> Bought this before, multiple times. They last about a year for me so are an excellent buy.</li>
    <li> Same as always.  Just replacement heads</li>
    <li> Made my razor work like new.</li>
    <li> The new Norelco heads returned the razor to its original capabilities.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I need A+++</li>
    <li> great fit and good cutting cheaper than a new razor.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a timely manner and as described.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say that there is any difference</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband and he loves it and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver and these heads for years with no problems.</li>
    <li> They are just slightly better than my 20 year olds.</li>
    <li> THESE HEADS MAKE AN OLD SHAVER LIKE A NEW ONE</li>
    <li> Not good blades and overpriced.  Don&#x27;t think they are original manufacturer blades.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my cutting head had become.  The new replacement is great and provides a really close shave.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement unit . Easy to replace. Shaver is like new now !</li>
    <li> I had the original heads from 6 years ago.  Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with the new ones.  I thought i would get a much closer shave.</li>
    <li> Just love this product.  I hate shaving with a razor, which is why I own a Norelco.  Amazon is a great web site because I can get really good deals.</li>
    <li> cheaper than a replacement razor and works great..i would recommen this..great for a gift or just as a replacement head..</li>
    <li> They built this wrong. The heads will &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; down too far and become recessed every time I used it, even with a light touch.</li>
    <li> Perfect and a good price!</li>
    <li> Fits my razor well &amp; has saved me from having to purchase a new razor.  Comparable replacements in a store would have cost as much as a new razor</li>
    <li> Easy replacement and more cost effective than buying a whole new razor.</li>
    <li> the experience on this order was wonderful. the product is excellent arrived in perfect condition , price was great and I would deferenty recomend to anyone/</li>
    <li> it was the right part and works fine for the money you can not go wrong will buy again when needed</li>
    <li> Brand name replacement part. Works well. Fairly simple installation</li>
    <li> The blades that came with my razor finally gave out...it felt like they were pulling my whiskers out instead of cutting them off. When I put these replacements in, I was amazed at just how bad I&#x27;d let those old blades get. My razor again gives me a close, smooth shave without any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original blades lasted over two years, but I&#x27;ll probably not wait that long to replace these. There&#x27;s really no reason for putting up with any discomfort due to old blades (like I did with the previous set).</li>
    <li> These replacement heads work well in my Norelco shaver. I only dropped one of them getting them installed. They immediately improved my shaving experience.</li>
    <li> These heads were noiser than the ones that came with the razor so I kept the original ones rather than throwing them out</li>
    <li> Standard replacement razors. Work fine for me</li>
    <li> This was supposed to be the exact replacement for the cutter heads for my Phillips electric shaver.  It appears the Phillips has changed the design to reduce the number of blades on each cutter.  In addition, the cutter heads do not fit properly.  After installing the cutter heads I got a lousy shave.  I went back to my old cutter heads and even though they were old they at least gave me a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend Phillip products to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and easy to replace.  Does not do that great on my neck area, but I just dry shave that with a razor to get the last hairs; it is still better than doing a full shave with a razor.</li>
    <li> my Norelco shaver was taking a long time to shave, ordered new heads and got them in record time. it is like a new razor, would recemend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I sent it back because it wasn&#x27;t the right.</li>
    <li> Saved time by buying online and price was good.</li>
    <li> Great product at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Shavinf is so much  better when you chane the blades as recommended.</li>
