    <li> Wonderful product.  Really put my hair in great shape.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. When I see reviews saying that the product isn&#x27;t the same when ordered online I want to say Duh! Have you not heard that you&#x27;re only guaranteed legit salon product when purchasing from the actual salon?! Google diversion. Also prices in salon are cheaper than this. Daily shampoo is $12 moisture is $14 and repair is $16. Conditioners are 14,16,18.</li>
    <li> Use in conjunction w/reconstructor as recommended by hair stylist</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years.  I like that it&#x27;s made locally and is great for my hair.</li>

    <li> Great product, works well on my coarse hair.</li>
    <li> This is basically the same review I wrote for the conditioner, except that I do use the Shampoo every day. My hair gets greasy overnight so I feel like I need to wash it every day and the Loma shampoo is really gentle for everyday use. *See below...&lt;br /&gt;I started using Loma when my daughter worked at a salon that carried it. It is extremely light and you do not need to use very much. I have long hair and I pretty much just use the shampoo on my scalp and the conditioner on my ends. My hair is super shiny and so healthy. I do not have to use the conditioner every day but I also use the Nourishing oil treatment after each wash. It is good for when I leave my hair curly and for when I straighten it. I should also mention that I have Polynesian hair so it is a little bit unruly and frizzy but Loma keeps it smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Have quite frizzy, dry hair, and this product relaxes those qualities, especially in the humid weather I live in.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes to clear up my daughter&#x27;s dry scalp.  It&#x27;s a nice shampoo but did not clear up her scalp issues.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is very nice, but does not work for me as I have very fine hair and the shampoo leaves my hair to limp.</li>
    <li> I have been using Loma product for 8 months now and I would highly recommend it.  My hair always feel healthy.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair shine and spunk...easy to rinse, and finishing with the Loma daily conditioner gives me a lot of &amp;#34;good hair days&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My daughter visited over the holidays and brought with her a bottle of Loma Organic Moisturizing Shampoo. The outside of the bottle was a pale green color. I tried it and just loved what it did for my hair. I ordered a bottle from Amazon on line and when it arrived the bottle was a dark green color. After using the shampoo, it was not the same effect on my hair as the lighter green bottle. Loma  had changed the look of the packaging and also the ingredients of the shampoo. Was very disappointed with the results from the different packaging. Please bring back the way it used to be in the lighter bottle. Had to send this purchase back.</li>
    <li> Loma products are fantastic!</li>
