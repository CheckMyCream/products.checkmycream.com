      <li>All it did was make my blackheads more prominent..</li>
      <li>I love it üòç</li>
      <li>It was more work than needed.</li>

      <li>I love it, my skin is smooth and clean.</li>
      <li>nd make my skin smooth</li>

      <li>it does clean your face</li>
      <li>I was actually pretty excited to try this product!</li>
      <li>Its not that great... Basically just sits on my nose and does absolutely no difference ..</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really cool.</li>
      <li>You need to put on a lot for it to peel off proper, but it works really good</li>
      <li>I doesn&#x27;t really work for me, and it took more than a month to arrive.</li>
      <li>After I used it I got full on breakouts on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and pretty fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, made my face feel smooth.</li>
      <li>It would be nice to have information in english</li>
      <li>are better products that hurt less when its removed&lt;br /&gt;Black soap is probably better</li>
      <li>OMG I can&#x27;t live with out this product!!!</li>
      <li>first time use</li>
      <li>but it really really work!</li>
      <li>I love the way my skin feels after this, and its always fun to see the dead skin and pore gunk that came off with the mask.</li>
      <li>i noticed how much dirt i had on my face and skin</li>
      <li>I really like....</li>
      <li>and this really helps</li>
      <li>But is very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Also, I would recommend peeling from the top down</li>
      <li>Wish it pulled a little more out</li>
      <li>lil to powerful pulls your facial hair out..</li>
      <li>It is definitely not for super sensitive skin because it&#x27;ll just make you break out.</li>
      <li>Would be fine for a face mask just for fun, but was NOT effective at removing blackheads.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t even come with directions for new users...</li>
      <li>Plus it came VERY early for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not ever felt my skin so clean, and I&#x27;m a spa and facial junkie, so I&#x27;m pretty critical of facial cleansing products.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t help clear my face at all</li>
      <li>Not harsh at all and already noticed results after 2 uses.</li>
      <li>And it just left my skin super dry.</li>
      <li>it clear th white stuff off my face</li>
      <li>And I never really see that much of a difference after its off.</li>
      <li>It left my skin really soft.</li>
      <li>I think this product works really well for average mid-thick skin.</li>
      <li>After peeling, my skin turned red from irritation, which is to be expected; I use witch hazel right after to bring the swelling down and it always works.</li>

<li> so I was getting very anxious and impatient....</li>

<li> I have really thick thick skin</li>
<li> this helps my acne so much it&#x27;s unbelievable!</li>
<li> I am not satisfied it keeps getting worse.</li>
<li> Not a good product</li>
<li> Which is weird because I haven&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Pulled out all my peach fuzz and hurts really bad to take off.</li>
<li> Painful.</li>
<li> Really disappointed..</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <li> OUCH! Be careful not to touch any of this to your eyebrows! Ripped off part of my eyebrow and peach fuzz and never had breakouts but woke up this morning with HUGE breakout! Buyer Beware</li>
    <li> Pulls out a lot of black head. It does hurt, when pulling it off. But it gets the job done and it does what it says. Only complaint is shipping takes forever.</li>
    <li> It kind of hurt but it really really work! So happy I got those.</li>
    <li> it clear th white stuff off my face nd make my skin smooth</li>
    <li> Painful. And I never really see that much of a difference after its off. Not that impressed.</li>
    <li> You need to put on a lot for it to peel off proper, but it works really good</li>
    <li> I love it, my skin is smooth and clean. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> WORKS JUST RIGHT LOVE THIS</li>
    <li> Hurt like hell to take off  My peach fuzz came off</li>
    <li> It peels like a stretchy glue and it&#x27;s kind of fun. When I used it, I don&#x27;t know if it pulled out blackheads (though I don&#x27;t have many to begin with), but my face did look like all the dead skin had been pulled off (so much cleaner). After peeling, my skin turned red from irritation, which is to be expected; I use witch hazel right after to bring the swelling down and it always works.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, I followed the instructions and tried this multiple times over several weeks. Does not work. I was very disappointed. Would be fine for a face mask just for fun, but was NOT effective at removing blackheads.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Works as described.</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t like this product... I&#x27;ve tried other products and this one is by far the most painful one I have EVER tried, it doesn&#x27;t really do its job in my opinion, I had every one in my home try it and they told me what a waste of money. I was actually pretty excited to try this product! It didn&#x27;t even come with directions for new users... Good thing I knew how to use this!</li>
    <li> It did not do as good of a job as i read up on. It was more work than needed. Stick to exfoliation</li>
    <li> Love it.. work perfect</li>
    <li> this helps my acne so much it&#x27;s unbelievable! It helps treating my face in the matter of a day</li>
    <li> I used for about a month at least 2 times a week. All it did was make my blackheads more prominent.. Really disappointed..</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see the difference on my skin</li>
    <li> Zero star don&#x27;t buy this product waste of money</li>
    <li> Honestly .. Its not that great... Basically just sits on my nose and does absolutely no difference .. Do not reccomend</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price! I&#x27;ve been applying it with my fingertips and while it can be a little messy, I find if I just let it dry and peel it off of my fingers instead of washing it off it&#x27;s a little easier. Also, I would recommend peeling from the top down so you go with the direction of hair growth. Like any peel, it&#x27;s going to hurt a little. I love the way my skin feels after this, and its always fun to see the dead skin and pore gunk that came off with the mask.</li>
    <li> It would be nice to have information in english</li>
    <li> Not harsh at all and already noticed results after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> OMG I can&#x27;t live with out this product!!! I&#x27;ve not ever felt my skin so clean, and I&#x27;m a spa and facial junkie, so I&#x27;m pretty critical of facial cleansing products. The mask once pealed feels like you went for dermaplanning facial treatment, all peach fuz GONE! Keep mask away from the brows when applying! Oh boy I&#x27;m in love with this product:) fairly quick delivery, excellent seller!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, made my face feel smooth. Honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work, however, it did and it was good.</li>
    <li> Nope, don&#x27;t buy. Doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I really like.... It works and I&#x27;m so happy.... I tried so many products to remove my blackheads on my nose and this really helps but I gotta keep using it because I have a lot on the top of my nose and by my nostrils.... I love it üòçüòçüòç but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like it took a while to get so I was getting very anxious and impatient....</li>
    <li> I think this product works really well for average mid-thick skin. I have really thick thick skin so it didn&#x27;t work so good on me. And it just left my skin super dry. It is definitely not for super sensitive skin because it&#x27;ll just make you break out. I would recommend this to people with averge skin.</li>
    <li> My wife said it came with no English instructions. What to do?</li>
    <li> it hurts like hell when you pull it off&lt;br /&gt;there are better products that hurt less when its removed&lt;br /&gt;Black soap is probably better</li>
    <li> be careful using it... lil to powerful pulls your facial hair out.. my face never break... but it did</li>
    <li> I doesn&#x27;t really work for me, and it took more than a month to arrive. Not a good product</li>
    <li> After I used it I got full on breakouts on my forehead and cheeks. I am not satisfied it keeps getting worse.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm. Thanks</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good. Wish it pulled a little more out but I liked it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to stick to my face enough to pull anything out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve followed the instructions other users have left but still doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
    <li> am very pleased with this product work perfectly  it does clean your face first time use i noticed how much dirt i had on my face and skin does feel great after use</li>
    <li> I saw comments that said they broke out. Which is weird because I haven&#x27;t. It left my skin really soft. Love the product it&#x27;s really cool. It peels well. But is very well. Will take off peach fuzz so be careful around hair. Plus it came VERY early for me. So I am happy</li>
    <li> Works perfectly!! You can automatically see a difference! Easy to use and pretty fast shipping!! I wasn&#x27;t expecting it till later this week!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t impress me. I followed the instructions provided by several other users and it did the same as my bior&amp;eacute; strips. I&#x27;ll stick with my strips from Wal mart, this is by no means the miracle product everyone makes it out to be. Excellent seller though, &amp; shipping was fast. Item arrived way ahead of the estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> Pulled out all my peach fuzz and hurts really bad to take off. Didn&#x27;t help clear my face at all</li>
