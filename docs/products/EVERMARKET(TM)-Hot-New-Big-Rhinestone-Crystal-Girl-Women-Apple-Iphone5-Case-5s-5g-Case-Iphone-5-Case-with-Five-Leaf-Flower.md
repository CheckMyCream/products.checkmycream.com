    <li> I had a slight crack on the corner of the case</li>
    <li> I have had this iPhone 5S case since January 2014 (now it&#x27;s September) NEVER change it. Some of the sparkles sometimes came off but the case came with 5 sparkles that you can easily reattach with simple glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best case plus had lots of COMPLIMENTS</li>
    <li> They got sloppy on the blue alittle &amp; gets dirty easily if ya know what I mean. But a good case.</li>
    <li> when it arrived it was missing jem stones and used it maybe once. Not that thrilled wil&lt;br /&gt;th this one&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> It did not fit my phone</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. And had glue gun strings all over it. I had a rhinestone fall off as soon as I got it out of the package.</li>
    <li> All these cover are awesome! I change them out almost everyday! I will be back to stock up when I get my iPhone 6.</li>
    <li> missing studs on case!&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap looking and not to mention I got it with studs missing.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t ever get it again.</li>
    <li> Not the highest quality but so cheap I didn&#x27;t expect much. Very pretty and the &#x27;gems&#x27; have not budged!</li>
    <li> want to know why not come my protector</li>
    <li> so not happy with this phone case, can see where they glued everything on.. Feels very cheap. And mine came with a crack it in. Definitely returning it and getting my money back hopefully..</li>
