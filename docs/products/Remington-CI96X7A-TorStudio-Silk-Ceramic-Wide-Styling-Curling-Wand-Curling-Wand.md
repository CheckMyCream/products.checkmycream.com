      <li>Arrived very quick, brand new box.</li>
      <li>Also the silk ceramic barrel will easily make the hair slip with trying to wand it around so make sure you either wear the glove or be careful trying to keep the hair in place on the barrel.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great wands, way better than my other set. Though I burn myself often w/ these the glove is no help at all &amp; curls tend to fall often.</li>
    <li> excelent product. shipping so good</li>
    <li> i like this wand, it gets HOT fast and the curls are very nice !  YOU MUST PRACTICE HOW TO USE A CURLING WAND . I saw soo many bad reviews for no reason this product is GOOD , its just hard to use a curling wand if you dont know how or if its your first time . Yes the hair slipped ALOT but after en ENTIRE day of practicing i learned how to stop the slippage . I did my moms hair which is very short and it was beautiful , i did my hair which is very long and it still curled from root to tip (thank god, finally sometjing that works for my long hair) . Tips: the smaller the section you curl the tighter and prettier it comes out , also count to 10-20 and hold the curl in your hand as it cools instead of dropping it before it curls that way you get a nice curl. Love this , i use it almost every other day .</li>
    <li> Love it.... but if your hair is really thin don&#x27;t use the highest temperature it will burn your Hair</li>
    <li> The details did not mentioned that it could only be used for 110V.</li>
    <li> I live in jersey . Not a thing to dislike about this product . Very affordable . Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future ! üòçüí≥ I have a video on my Instagram @cinxcityy Using this trendy curing wand üòçüé¨üíã it heats up very fast üî• I absolutely love it ‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!! I am a huge fan of curly hair and this wand surely does the trick!</li>
    <li> I did not like this item.  It does not contin the curl flap.</li>
    <li> This wand has the power and temp buttons on the side, so the lock button is perfect to keep it from turning off while I am using it. My curls last all day.</li>
    <li> I love this wand!! This wand does the perfecf curls and whatever curls you want depending on how you use it. In my opinion i think its better then the two other curling wands i have which they were expensive. I recommend this curling wand</li>
    <li> Mostly ordered this product because the color was supposed to be cute.  Instead I get something with a black barrel and a red handle.  Clearly,  not what I thought I was ordering.</li>
    <li> Love this wand and the temperature adjuster</li>
    <li> My favourite tool of vanity!</li>
    <li> My curls stay in, and it heats up fast!</li>
    <li> i just started to learn how to use a wand and this one is great for that. I used the glove one time and now I don&#x27;t use it at all. it is small wand leaving small curls so if you want a large curl this one is not for you. heats up fast I would recommend this to others</li>
    <li> This item was not a posted. It was described as new, I recieved the item in a plain ups box so obviously it wasnt &amp;#34;unopened&amp;#34;. Also it smelled like someone else hairspray, and also it was posted and described with a heat glove, well did not get that either, very dissapointed in the item and the transaction, ill be definetly be looking elsewhere</li>
    <li> So I chose Remington because it&#x27;s a pretty good brand of hair products and I cannot say a bad word about this curling wand. I have really thick and long (60-70 cm) hair. It takes me like 20-30 mins to get them perfectly curled up and then they stay curled even 2-3 days!! This was a good  investment!! :D</li>
    <li> I bought this item excepting the color above and as given in the details. When the object came in it was a completely different one with different colors. I paid 30$ for this when I could go to Walmart buy the SAME one I got from here for 17$. It&#x27;s a ripoff. DONT BUY</li>
    <li> WOW.! I just received this item and i tried it, i cant believe how fast it got hot and how nice my curls looked and stayed.! i definitely need some practice but i totally recommend that you buy this. i have a wet to straight straightner and it has lasted me for a long time know maybe 6 years and i would only buy from Remington since this one has lasted me longer. i love it.!!!!</li>
    <li> This wand was perfect for curling my leave out of my curly extensions. The glove came in very handy, being that it was my first time using a curling device. I liked the digital temperature window and how fast it heated up and cooled down. The only thing that was missing was a carrying case or bag. It doesnt come with something in wich you can put it away o secure for traveling.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this and she has used it many times since it arrived. It makes great spiral curls and comes with a gloves so you don&#x27;t burn your fingers.</li>
    <li> good wand. but it looks cheap because of the material</li>
    <li> They curl so beautifully!  Burned myself many times lol, it comes with a glove but I chose not to use it, it feels weird. But these are the BEST want curlers! Do NOT try the ConAir brand, you will be highly disappointed, it doesn&#x27;t hold the curls at all and the heat maximum says 400 degrees but it&#x27;s more like 300.</li>
    <li> I bought mine from Wal-Mart! Same price. Guaranteed new and fresh (for the people with packaging issues).  Also comes with a heating glove! (For those who didn&#x27;t get theirs). As far as how it works- it&#x27;s great!!!! Refreshes ANY hair with a gloss finish on the curl. Heats up fast. Easy to handle. Just amazing</li>
    <li> I will say that the first time I used this wand the curls didn&#x27;t turn out how I expected but I felt that was more on my end because I was doing a rush job so I didn&#x27;t wait for the time it says it will take for the wand to actually heat up. Which isn&#x27;t long only about a couple of seconds but like I said I was rushing. The second try with the wand was MARVELOUS! I loved the way the curls turned out. They were medium shaped and held nicely! Also the silk ceramic barrel will easily make the hair slip with trying to wand it around so make sure you either wear the glove or be careful trying to keep the hair in place on the barrel. Nice price too!! I wasn&#x27;t looking for something too expensive since this is my first personal wand, but others I&#x27;ve used (friends) were okay and their prices were just the same, OK. So I took initiative and bought this wand, no one had it yet (and probably wont for a while since its new) so I bought it purely off of my instinct and my personal opinion and judgement. It was either going to be a lesson learned or my $$&#x27;s worth. I ended up getting my $$&#x27;s worth cause I love it.</li>
    <li> love the color and it heats up fast. i like the heat setting change option as well. i&#x27;m still learning to use it properly but overall a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like curler it works really good fast at receiving it thanks!</li>
    <li> The description for this item said it came with a heat proof glove, that is one of the reasons I chose this one.  It arrived in a plastic bag with no instructions and no heat proof glove.  If it hadn&#x27;t been a gift for my daughter&#x27;s birthday I would have returned it.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> Great for beginners like me who like to explore!</li>
    <li> My daughters hair is thick and straight....she loves this item makes beautiful curls!  Would definitely recommend to others to buy!</li>
    <li> I was going to go to walmart and get one, but I didn&#x27;t know when i would have time so i just found one on here.. it just what i wanted</li>
    <li> works great.  good deal on it.  the locatio of the temperature buttons on the side are such that when I use it, i oftentimes will increase/decrease the temperature accidentally.  They could have placed those settings in an area where your hand isn&#x27;t working...</li>
    <li> So far this is a good buy. I plugged it in and turned it on and did a test on a section of my hair (which is natural) and it worked really well. cant wait to try it on some brazilian hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the type of wave this creates. It is more of a kink than a wave...much like if you were to braid your hair wet and that would save a lot of time, versus curling your entire head with this wand. I also didn&#x27;t like how tight the kinks were...looks best if you do it the night before and sleep on it.  I ended up buying a more expensive larger barrel wand instead to give me that beachy wave that I was looking for. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> Ordered a curling wand and I received a flat iron. Fortunately for me, it&#x27;s a really good ceramic iron and it has a digital temperature setting.  It straightens my hair very well not to mention.</li>
    <li> Perfect product! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Arrived very quick, brand new box. Works perfectly as I expected! Only thing is my package didn&#x27;t have a shipping order for proof of purchase but I don&#x27;t need to return the item so I guess that&#x27;s irrelevant. Also has a warranty.</li>
    <li> I purchased this styling wand hoping for the soft waving curls that come from wrapping hair.  This styling wand was a great disappointment.  First - the off/on and heat control buttons are in a terrible location - right where you want to hold the wand.  I was constantly accidentally resetting the temperature while trying to use this wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next problem is the heated styling area of the wand.  No part of your hair will stay on the larger part of the wand - hair slips to the very tiny end - and slips off completely.  You are given a glove to help prevent burning, and I assume to help physically hold your hair onto the wand.  I found the glove to be cumbersome and it was hard to section my hair while wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried to use this wand twice with disappointing results each time.  The uneven curls produced at only the very ends of my hair were ridiculously tiny and unnatural in every way.  I would donate this wand to charity if I thought it could be of use to someone else, but I don&#x27;t think it could.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Curls don&#x27;t last long through out the day and glove seems like a regular weather gloves not a thermal usage protectiing glove. Other than that brand type and style is fine</li>
    <li> I Love it!! Works just fine.</li>
    <li> It is Very easy to use and heats up quickly. The only  downfall is that I kept accidentally hitting the temp setting while using the wand. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. The only thing that I was confused about is that the picture &amp; caption says it&#x27;s pink but when I got it, it was red and black. But all &amp; all it works really good . I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Its okay wish I would have bought others thingo though but it work great</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really hard to handle. It is very slippery</li>
    <li> I was very excited to take this home and tried it out right away. I thought the tapered design would be great, but was very disappointed. My hair is very long (mid back) and I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to stay at the wider end of the wand. It kept sliding down to the very end so i ended up with very small, tight curls. Not cute on a grown woman. And the only times I burned myself was when I was trying to keep my hair at the wider portion of the wand. The glove made it difficult to hold my hair and know when I was approaching the end of my hair. I ended up taking the glove off after a few sections of hair. I will be returning this right away getting one with a wider, strait barrel. On the plus side, it did curl very well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. the heat glove works. she said it works as good as the one they let her use at the salon.</li>
    <li> I love wearing my hair in spiral curls, but didn&#x27;t want to pay $100 for the clipless curling wands they sell in the mall kiosks.  I bought this wand and kept the receipt, thinking it probably wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as the one I borrowed from my friend (who did pay $$$ from the mall kiosk).  I think it works great and I have never gotten so many compliments on my hair.  I can curl my hair and it lasts all day.  I can sleep on it, brush it out for looser waves the next day, and it still stays all day!  I have never found a curling wand that holds curls so well.  I do use the TREsemme heat protection/hold spray prior to curling b/c this goes up to 410 degrees.  For the reviewer that gave this 1 star because the hair won&#x27;t stay on the larger part of the barrel and shifts to the bottom, you are correct..it tends to do that if you are holding the hair out and/or down...but if you hold the wand up, with the larger barrel closest to your head, and load the hair that way, it will stay to the larger part of the barrel and still results in a perfect spiral when you drop it down.  There is a learning curve; but when you get used to it..you don&#x27;t even need to use the glove.  Also, if you read the directions, it immediately tells you that the middle button (also used for lowering the temperature) when held for 3 seconds locks the current temperature.  I have never had it change while curling my hair when it&#x27;s in the locked position.  This model is called the slim wand...so this will not provide large spirals.  If medium to small spirals are what you are looking for...look no further.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for me. Can&#x27;t complain. It works well, gets hot very fast and does the job professionally. A must have</li>
    <li> I have thin straight hair and always had problems curling my hair with a regular curling iron. This wand works great, with the curls lasting the entire day with little additional hair product.</li>
    <li> nice product, my girlfriend loves it</li>
    <li> This is a good curling wand. It is not bad. BUT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mechanism for which you are meant to have ease with maneuvering the cord gets caught and stuck because it is pretty cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buttons constantly press while I&#x27;m attempting to style my hair, changing the temperature up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is honestly a cheaper made version of their Remington Pearl Ceramic Wand, which you can only purchase online now. I bought this when my Pearl Wand ran out of juice at the local Target, and will be returning it to purchase the Pearl one online. Go for that, for it is much better and makes silkier waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re looking for a slightly cheaper buy that&#x27;s local {sold at Walmart and Target and about 5 dollars less}, go for it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good curling iron but when you&#x27;re curling your hair it&#x27;s easy to adjust the buttons accidentally.</li>
    <li> I love my wand curlers I been haven them for almost a year now an they work so GD an I am very happy!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it not a useful tool for hair</li>
    <li> Just holding it for a couple seconds will instantly give you a curl! 10 seconds? You&#x27;ve got amazing curls. Ladies, say bye bye to curling irons. This is the real deal. :) I had heard of a couple people who said it doesn&#x27;t work - but the thing is, you&#x27;ve got to know how to HOLD it (my method I was taught is cord to the ceiling, wand to the floor), you&#x27;ve got to SECTION your hair especially if it&#x27;s thick (like mine). That&#x27;s the trick. Just know what you&#x27;re doing, if anything, do your research on YouTube tutorials, and you&#x27;ll be all set. ;)</li>
    <li> Love, but the glove included is cumbersome because it&#x27;s too big for my small hand.</li>
    <li> I love Remington products. This Iron wand is really easy to use and perfect for all occasion. The pressing buttons are easy to press and easy to navigate. Though I haven&#x27;t tried yet other similar products as I&#x27;m very solid to Remington brand, but it&#x27;s perfect as it is.</li>
    <li> I liked it until the on button stopped working.</li>
    <li> I have that Asian, naturally pin straight hair that is difficult to style with heat, but this wand actually creates curls that last up to about 3 days. I would have tested another day with it, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the feeling of unwashed hair any longer! I&#x27;m just putting it out there that curls with this wand STAY FOR A LONG TIME! Other raters said that the wand is difficult to use, but it&#x27;s actually pretty easy. You have to understand that in order for your hair to stay on the wand, you must point the nose of the wand downwards. Also, I&#x27;ve read that other raters were annoyed by the buttons on the handle. Guys, you can LOCK the temperature setting just by holding the minus (-) button. By locking it, you won&#x27;t unintentionally change the settings or accidentally turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR: This product works great. Be sure to read ALL instructions/warnings before using it. Otherwise, you&#x27;re gonna have troubles that could have been avoided.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I saw someone use it on my hair and I Loved it and I still love it. It is so easy to use and it curls so fast.</li>
    <li> Works really well for my daughter who has thick hair.  Works quickly.</li>
    <li> Exactly as the description, and fast shipping. I&#x27;m in love with the different curl patterns I create with this wand. Great product !</li>
    <li> Real good for styling hair into those amazing Hollywood inspired looks. This is also able to style small and tight curls that bigger curling irons aren‚Äôt able to do.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is the placement of the buttons- I always accidentally touch them. Other than that- love this product</li>
    <li> Love this!! Only device that can curly my irritating naturally straight hair.</li>
    <li> Works well on my little girl&#x27;s hair.  Very fast, and perfect curls.</li>
    <li> perfect completely beautiful</li>
