      <li>I have tried many slanted tweezers, the best brand is still Rubis from Switzerland.</li>
      <li>The tweezer no longer successfully grabs the unwanted hair, instead, it slides off causing the hair, causing it to disappear under the skin, often resulting in hair follicle irritation or infection.</li>
      <li>Love it, works great!</li>
      <li>These are good tweezers.</li>
      <li>She has always loved Tweezerman&#x27;s tweezers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent for hair removal &amp; various other things as well!</li>
    <li> Stop torturing yourself with those $4 tweezers you got from Walgreens and get these already. Plucks hair on the first try (or at least the second), not the tenth, and it pulls the whole hair out, not just the tip.</li>
    <li> When I borrow other people&#x27;s tweezers I&#x27;m disappointed. I&#x27;ve been spoiled by great tweezers, they get every hair the first time. They&#x27;re kind of sharp on the edges, so maybe not leave them floating around in a bag.</li>
    <li> So...I&#x27;m a guy. And these are amazing tweezers. Grip well and haven&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
    <li> Love it, works great! would recommend it</li>
    <li> This is our second pair of these tweezers. You can pluck those hairs that are barely starting to sprout, and the grip on these is great. This pair is going into a travel bag.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t grow facial hair well. While saving is generally good enough for mustache and beard the real problem I have is with neck hair. My facial hair grows patchy and thin, and shaving my neck hair causes it to look very uneven with ugly stubble. My old cheap pair of tweezers couldn&#x27;t grip the hairs, and often would cut the hair without pulling it from the follicle. These tweezers work wonders though, easily grabbing the hairs and pulling out the follicles. Since using these I&#x27;ve noticed a more clean appearance, while my lack of facial hair does cause me to look a bit younger than I actually am it looks tons better than the results I was receiving before where it looks like I got very drunk, tried to shave my neck hairs and got bored mid way through. It&#x27;s also great because I don&#x27;t have to grow out my hairs to wax them, which knowing my facial hair growth would present a problem since I am expected to maintain a professional appearance as part of my work. Overall, it is a steep price, but the results are too good to pass up.</li>
    <li> Major disappointment and waste of money!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are MORE than worth the money!</li>
    <li> Unbelievably precise tweezers for cosmetic use. They have held up well, maintaining their precision, for years now, and they are readily refurbishable by the company in any case. You will find and remove hairs you didn&#x27;t know you had - every time.</li>
    <li> This tweezer is way, way overpriced. It is very difficult to actually pull out a hair because it keeps slipping out of the tweezer. Not recommended at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many tweezers in my life time, always picking up the generic standard tweezers from the grocery store and always being frustrated by the lack of quality.  Finally, after years of tweezer frustration (as silly as that sounds), I decided to spend the extra $10 to get a pair of Tweezerman tweezers after reading others reviews.  Just got to say that spending the extra money is well worth it for the quality and frustration free tweezing.  Don&#x27;t have to worry anymore that I can&#x27;t get the smallest of hairs because these tweezers pick up everything.  Thank you Tweezerman, and thank you Amazon for offering the best price around.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with other items from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package was missing the tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phoning resulted in an immediate forwarding of the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have e-mail from Amazon, asking for a return of the \\&quot;missing\\&quot; item.&lt;br /&gt;Threatened to charge my American Express twice. What an idiotic system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again. I can get it locally, I&#x27;ll do this instead next time.&lt;br /&gt;This is about the 15th run-in I&#x27;ve had from Amazon. Their service is too large, disorganised&lt;br /&gt;and unfriendly.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are a huge step up from my 10 year old drug store tweezers.  If you are use to dull points, be careful with these.  They are super sharp and you can easily cut or pinch skin.  Still getting the hang of these tweezers, as my old ones are the \\&quot;scissor style.\\&quot;  After a few uses, I was getting all the hairs without breaking them off (which I did the first time I used them).  Let my mom tried them and she loved them as well.  Bought her a pair shortly after!</li>
    <li> Product is excellent, worth the extra money. Able to extract very small and fine hairs with ease. Will tell friends about this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to know if these tweezers were good and plucked the tiniest hair. The tweezers I had before wouldn&#x27;t grab the hairs very well. I have been using these tweezers for over a month and they have been great! They clean up my eye brow easily. They grab even the tiniest hairs which make it easy to pull because they have a good grip. These tweezers get everything and are the best tweezers I have ever own!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best tweezers I&#x27;ve used!  I would hightly recommend it...</li>
    <li> Great tweezers even get the hard-to-reach hairs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tweezing since I was 11yrs old..... I have tried all kinds of different type of tweezers. I can say that these by far are the best at grabing the smallest hair and pulling them out. I have thick eyebrow hair that some times shows underneath the skin before it actually breaks through. Tweezer man does the job of breaking the skin and grabs onto the hair and gets the hair out with no bleeding. Granted, this technique takes practice. I really like that they are sharp and pointy. This really lets you get a close grab on the hair.     Tip, I got mine for 12.99+Tax at Marshalls. I suggest you peek around Ross, TJ Maxx, or some other similar local store. You just might come up paying way less for them.</li>
    <li> Sure, you can buy a pair of tweezers for $3 at the drugstore, but they last a year or two at most. Tweezerman tweezers are so well made that they stay sharp much longer and the company has a free lifetime sharpening service. The slant tweezers are easy to use, even if you&#x27;re not an expert. They&#x27;re a must have!</li>
    <li> These are terrific tweezers. Sharp but not skin cutting. Fabulous grip, precision aligned, easy to hold onto. A great buy!</li>
    <li> My female friends and I really LOVE the Tweezerman products, including these Slant Tweezers.  Tweezerman has really high-quality products, and they last forever.  Lots, if not all, of their products have lifetime guarantees (check individual items).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regular tweezers that you buy at a discount store or a drug store, they end up being less sensitive and it takes quite a few attempts to grab the hair.  That can make your frustration level really high, and you don&#x27;t want to be stressed out when you&#x27;re shaping your eyebrows!  Anyways, in contrast to all of the other tweezers we&#x27;ve used, the Tweezerman brand always represents high-quality, long-lasting, reliable products, and they really come through for you on ease-of-use and precision.  Highly recommend, and although I love a deal, I don&#x27;t care how much Tweezerman products cost because they are worth every penny!</li>
    <li> IT REALLY DOES THE JOB, THIS IS MY THIRD ONE, STILL HAVE THE OTHER TWO, THIS ONE IS FOR SPARE</li>
    <li> Tweezerman is by far the best quality and the slant tip is my favorite for eyebrows. It makes life so much easier when you have the right tool for the right job.</li>
    <li> I always found myself to be the type of person who would choose quality over quantity, but not when it came to little things, such as nail clippers/tweezers. I took a chance on these because I&#x27;ve seen magazines continuously rave about it, and I am so glad that I did! You see, I have used several pairs of Revlon tweezers for the past few years, mainly because they got worn out over time or they ended up getting bent in some odd way. I bought these tweezers in early August, and they still work as well as the day I bought them! They catch every hair, even the ones that slip through my Revlons! These are a must have, though I think I may have gotten overly-addicted to plucking hairs ):</li>
    <li> Affordable &amp; High quality</li>
    <li> I am so glad I ordered these tweezers and I can see why these are often considered the top rated tweezers in the world. I am sorry I waited until I am in my 60&#x27;s to order these. Does that make sense? These tweezers just work so much better than normal tweezers -- it&#x27;s a difference between having a precision tool and a cheapie tool.</li>
    <li> I have had dozens of pairs of tweezers before and so happy I found these for my eyebrows!  Wish I had found these years ago to tame my bushy eyebrows!</li>
    <li> This tweezer gets every hair, even those at the skin line.  Once it needs sharpening I just hope that it doesn&#x27;t take long to be returned.  I can&#x27;t be without it for more than a couple days.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a pair of tweezers, right?  Nothing to get excited about, right?  Sure... if 99% of tweezers out there weren&#x27;t crap, that would be true.  As it is, most tweezers are made very cheaply with cheap material.  As a result, they don&#x27;t grip well.  And all we ask of a pair of tweezers is that they grip well, whether we&#x27;re talking about hairs or splinters or whatever.  Why is this a great pair of tweezers?  Because it grips well, &#x27;nuff said.  High quality materials and quality construction.  Not rocket science.  Worth the price, easy five stars.</li>
    <li> These are nice, heavy duty tweezers.  I purchased the black ones and they are easy to hold, do not slip around under your fingers, and function quite well.  Possibly a bit expensive, but a quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to buy these tweezers for a while but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money. I&#x27;m so glad that I finally did as these are the best tweezers I had.  They pull out the hairs at the root and you do not have to worry about the hairs breaking as you are pulling them out.  Definately worth the money.</li>
    <li> They are OK, but not  much more &#x27;grippy&#x27; that old tweezers I have which I bought these to replace. I don&#x27;t think they are worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was one of many who probably ran to Wally World (ahem, Wal*Mart) to buy a pair of tweezers only to realize we didn&#x27;t know what were buying. My Wal*Mart pair were severely incapable of the most basic duty of a Tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However these stainless steel slant tweezers from Tweezerman are excellent! If you can reach it, you can tweeze it. lol :)</li>
    <li> Amazon offers these at a discounted prices compared to the local beauty stores that I usually go to, and am very pleased with them. It got great handling and is strong enough to lift out unwanted hair easily the first time. I&#x27;m not a professional but appreciate a good quality tool. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants a high quality tweezer.</li>
    <li> i really love these.  i can understand the price now...others may only be 5- 10 dollars but arent as good and certainly dont last as long.  very happy with my purchase.  i have fine blonde hair and they actually work!!</li>
    <li> When I saw these tweezers I was really excited because I know how hard it is to find a great tweezer.  I decided to try them because they had alot of positive feedback.  Let me just say that they did not live up to my expectations.  When I first used them, they were flat together and had very little \\&quot;spring\\&quot; which left little force to get those short, difficult hairs.  The packag said you can slowly pull them apart for more resistance, but that did not change the fact that the tips are very sharp and they hurt your face without pulling out the smaller hairs.  When I targeted one hair in particular, the tweezers failed to pull it out and just kinked it up, forcing me to use a different pair of tweezers to grab the imbedded hair.  For the price, I was very surprised that they were not the best pair of tweezers I ever had.  I would never buy these again and I suggest that others save their money.</li>
    <li> they cut the hair rather than grip and pull. maybe it was just the pair i had. I&#x27;ve used tweezerman for years and never had this problem</li>
    <li> Dislike.  Dont look nor feel like my previous Tweezerman.  It&#x27;s very light, cheaper almost quality, doesn&#x27;t grip right nor pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge waste of $$$$.  I wish I could send it back.</li>
    <li> I am one of those super neurotic people who cannot stand to have stray hairs anywhere on me. I have gone through tons and tons of tweezers-each time buying cheapo brands to save money. They all sucked. I dropped $15.00 on these and don&#x27;t regret it at all. They are THE BEST! These get the TINIEST hairs w/o a problem. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned!  Tip is a good size and it grips really well onto whatever you are tweezing!  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is my second pair of them, and I will never use anything else.  All other tweezers area joke compared to these.  Once you&#x27;ve use these, you will never go back!  I highly reccomend them :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using these tweezers for 6 months now (purchased Sep 2011) and I feel really let down after being lured into this purchase by the high ratings, especially when I paid $18.  Since I don&#x27;t have much good to say about these tweezers, I&#x27;ll start with the cons:  They don&#x27;t consistently grip hairs - it takes repeated attempts to get an appropriate grip which becomes infuriating.  When you do get a grip there&#x27;s a good chance the hair is going to be cut in half (I would guess one out of four times).  Also, the edges are entirely too sharp and makes for a great skin cutting tool.  I wouldn&#x27;t be writing this review if the average rating for this product was a 3 star...but at 4.5 stars, I feel like I need to share my frustrations.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love these tweezers, but was sadly disappointed when I got them home and tried them for hair removal.  They simply did not work and regretfully, I was out $18.00.  My inexpensive Revlon tweezers work so much better, holding the grasp and accomplishing hair removal.</li>
    <li> I use these to pluck gray pubic hairs that have started cropping up. They are great. As you age....You will want to own these.</li>
    <li> I formerly owned Tweezerman tweezers that were purchased years ago.  Lost them so decided to purchase another.  They worked ok for one week.  No complaints with the company&#x27;s service--packaged nicely and shipped fast.  I threw out the Tweezerman tweezers and decided to purchase the Revlon tweezers which work just fine.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
    <li> Best tweezer I have ever bought! Just hard to get greasy hairs as i would call it.</li>
    <li> why this product is rising it price on my wish list?? i deleted this from my list of course and also because i notice i have this same twisters and they are so thick and harsh on your sking it made me bleed some times.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy the cheap brands, this brand is THE best. So far I have not needed to have them sharpened, but his company is supposed to sharpen them for free. They are accurate and precise. Love them!</li>
    <li> Pretty good but they are very expensive.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are much more likely to cut the hair in half while it&#x27;s still in your head than to yank it out. They may be precise, but that precision is useless if the ends are so sharp that they cut the hair before pulling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for build quality.</li>
    <li> Every makeup bag and first aid kit should have a pair of TWEEZERMAN SLANT TWEEZERS! Excellent for keeping brows clean between waxing. Brush the brows in the opposite direction of the hair growth then slide right under the hair with the TWEEZERMAN SLANT TWEEZER clasp down and pull right out! Painless and clean!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this to replace the one I lost. Tweezerman&#x27;s slanted tweezers are, in my opinion, the best in the market. And I&#x27;ve bought and tried my fair share of tweezers.    I primarily use mine to maintain the shape of my eyebrows so I work with baby/short hairs. And I&#x27;m sure most of you know how difficult and irritating plucking baby hairs can be especially when using an insufficient tool. Well, this product was the answer to my tweezing prayers. In addition, Tweezerman has a free sharpening service ([...]) so a Tweezerman tweezer is definitely worth your money.</li>
    <li> I have been wasting money all these years buying cheap tweezers. These tweezers work great</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I read reviews.  Bought them.  Glad to pay more to get improved quality.  Two months later I am so disappointed.  They worked perfectly well for only a short time.</li>
    <li> Thank you the Tweezerman Stainless steel slant tweezer, black, is just what I needed, help for the little hair I can not see</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers, they are super accurate, but for tweezing eyebrows it breaks quite a few hairs instead of plucking them out. Works great for splinters- since they are so sharp you can really get in there to pull them out even if the splinter is pretty deep.</li>
    <li> Wow, these are the best tweezers ever.</li>
    <li> Gets it first time, every time.</li>
    <li> This is my first tweezer and I absolutely love my decision to purchase it. Thanks to Amazon and Tweezerman to make it happen.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are by far superior to most drugstore tweezers. They grip even very fine hairs effectively. And they come with a warranty that includes free sharpening should the tweezers dull. They are not AS sharp as my Rubis/Mehaz tweezers but seem a little bit more sturdy. Overall quality product. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Reviews speak for themselves. No more struggling to get stubborn hairs.</li>
    <li> Catches almost every hair on the first try! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I use this for shaping my eyebrows, and it works great. I bought it to replace my cheapie TRIM angled tweezer, which served me for over 10 years.  However, in the past few years, it wasn&#x27;t getting all the short hairs at the roots.  I have only had it for a short time, but so far it has been performing very well.  It gets very short hairs by the roots.</li>
    <li> My sister had these, and I used them and I fell in love. So... I bought a pair for myself!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are better than anything I could find in the local stores.  They simply grip better.  They&#x27;re great for removing those stubborn ingrown whiskers.</li>
    <li> Item was as described and very nice.</li>
    <li> I know Tweezerman is a very good brand, this is why I paid close to $20 for the tweezers. Unfortunately, mine were defective. They did not work from the moment I took them out of the package. I contacted the seller and asked him if I could exchange them for another pair. Nope!  He claimed he had never had that issue with anyone before, well, there is always a first time. Items are sometimes defective.  I had to buy another pair of tweezermans from my local (but not so local) pharmacy. oh well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Tweezerman will sharpen the tweezers for free, I mailed them to the company. I think when you do business, you should be a bit more flexible than that. Not buying from this seller again. :-(</li>
    <li> Work great, came in a nice little holder tray with a plastic cover to keep the tweezers closed and clean. Machined to very good tolerances and aligned great.</li>
    <li> The best tweezers i&#x27;ve used. definitely worth the price and i would recommend it to anyone. Just make sure to keep the cover on the tips.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best tweezers I have ever owned. Really grabs hold.  Buy them you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Turns out it&#x27;s all I could&#x27;ve wished for in a tweezer: it looks good, it functions great, and the slant at the end makes stuff a whole lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone, especially for teens who&#x27;re just starting to learn how to use this</li>
    <li> This is one of the best tweezer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve had mine for few years not, and I&#x27;m still using it.. it pulls the hair without breaking it! Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My friends balked at me spending so much on a pair of tweezers, but these things are incredible -- worth every penny. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought two different cheapo tweezers and was not happy at all. I got tired of struggling to get tweezers to work, and sometimes I couldn&#x27;t get the really small hairs at all. These work and don&#x27;t make you work either. I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> I have an aging pair of Revlon tweezers I was hoping to upgrade.  These were an expensive mistake.  Hairs regularly break before being extracted.  I have abandoned these to the back of my medicine cabinet as an emergency backup, and I&#x27;m sticking with my Revlons.  I am an honest reviewer, and these tweezers were just a big waste of money.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman knows how to make a dang good tweezer! I love these and have had them for a while and they haven&#x27;t dulled at all</li>
    <li> Trying to buy good tweezers. These were half the cost of what was offered in drug store and better made. These are made very well and will get the tiniest sliver or hair.</li>
    <li> How well can anyone really rate tweezers anyhow?... I can certainly say that these work.  They are very useful for pulling loose stray hairs.  They grab the hairs well, are built of seemingly sturdy material, and are clean, sleek, and convenient.  Definitely better than your run of the mill metal tweezers.  This is my story: I needed a tweezer, I bought this one, and it looks like I won&#x27;t need to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a gentleman of the sort that would suffer from the social disease that is called unibrow, were it not for tweezers (I also do some light plucking too - I have bushy eyebrows). After my duty set of tweezers dulled, I had previously purchased a pair of [[ASIN:B001ET72CK Revlon Diamond Grip Tweezer, Slant Tip (Pack of 2)]] figuring brand wouldn&#x27;t matter all that much. Well, after being left with ugly scabs that make me look like a scabrous Meth fiend for a week, I can safely say it&#x27;s worth it to spend an extra few bucks on a tweezer. These Tweezerman tweezers work fine and the different colors make them easy to find in your medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> These are good tweezers.</li>
    <li> Those ill-designed tweezers from the local CVS, Rite-Aid, Duane Read? Throw them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are ninja tweezers and using them actually makes me look forward to my weekly teary-eyed cullings.</li>
    <li> sharp and they pluk even hair we don&#x27;t see.</li>
    <li> Tweezers are expensive, but in this I think you get what you pay for. These are sharp and precise and get my pesky little chin hairs out almost as soon as I begin to feel them. These are great quality for the money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why these tweezers received such good reviews from other users.  Yes, they do seem sharp but they also seem cheap and flimsy to me.  They are so lightweight that the slightest pressure will close the tip before you have even managed to grab the hair. Personally, I will stick with the Revlon tweezers at half the cost.</li>
    <li> Wow, tweezers that actually work!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on a cheap pair of tweezers that will only frustrate you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a good pair of tweezers once, and you&#x27;ll be set. I have these, and I like them a lot. The price is a little steep, but they work great. Also, they sharpen them for life (I haven&#x27;t done it yet, but others have).</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well these work and am so happy I found them, just wish it had been years earlier.  Best tweezer ever!</li>
    <li> For all the hype and the cost of this product, it really doesn&#x27;t perform any better that a cheap drugstore brand.</li>
    <li> Great product delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Being a guy there are those unfortunate hairs that pop up where you don&#x27;t want them. These tweezers grab better than any I&#x27;ve ever had before!</li>
    <li> My wife say&#x27;s these are the best tweezers she has ever had. She sent one to her sister, who also say&#x27;s &amp;#34;their the best ever&amp;#34; Very sharp, keep plastic tip cover on when not in use !!!</li>
    <li> For me a good  tweezer is well worth paying for and this is a very good tweezer. I had the same one, this brand, for six years and then dropped it and it went out of alignment. I immediately ordered my new tweezer. If not dropped I suspect this would last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I buy from amazon monthly! I have owned tweezerman tweezers  before and have never had a problem, I bought these and they are not aligned properly the point on slant does not go together. I wanted to return/replace this item and was told by seller that to due to it being a beauty item is was not possible , that i could send them to tweezerman they would back the product 100%. That is what I will have to do now , I think that if a company backs a product 100% then the seller should also . I will say I have learned I will always check return policy on sellers now. Love buying a new product that is defective and have to deal with shipping to the manufacturer and waiting for them to get it back to me. At least that is an option but beware of that policy before buying!</li>
    <li> When new, these are great, and sharp and get the job done very well. Tweezerman offers free sharpening, but you must ship at your cost.  The problem is, it takes 2-3 months to get the tweezers back, which is a very long time when you depend on a product.  I got a backup pair of tweezers for a dollar at a drugstore which work very well for the dollar pair I must say.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are heavy duty, precise and well built.  Does what it is supposed to do and grips well, unlike some more expensive tweezers I have bought which flex and do not grip well at all.  These do.</li>
    <li> This tweezer is fine.  Don&#x27;t drop it.  Just like wine glasses: Don&#x27;t drop them and they work fine.  Go tweezerman!!</li>
    <li> At first I thought 2 things. 1) It was too big and 2) why does it break every hair at the stem. The tweezer I owned earlier was about 2/3 the size and seemed to have better control being smaller. Eventually I got used to the size and don&#x27;t even notice it anymore. As far as hairs breaking, maybe that too was size or weight related but it doesn&#x27;t happen anymore, most hairs come out completely with the root intact. The tips are definitely sharper than others I&#x27;ve been used to but if you&#x27;re careful there&#x27;s no reason you should get hurt</li>
    <li> You can pull out eyebrow hairs that will make you proud!  I know it sounds silly, but I get a kick out of grabbing a hold of those hard to get, still in the skin hairs.  These tweezers will get those hard to get, not ready to come out of their hiding place hairs. They are incredibly well built and I appreciate the fact that they come with a tip cover, because as most people know, it only takes one bad fall to ruin a good pair of tweezers if they land on the tip.  Also, the lifetime guaranteed and free lifetime sharpening (you have to mail them in, but what&#x27;s $0.50 in postage?) makes them a bargain at $18.00 or so.  Go get em&#x27;!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product.  It was supposed to be slanted, but the slant is very small making it almost straight.  Because of the small slant it has to be held almost at a right angle, which I find uncomfortable.  I also found that it is too sharp and cuts off as many hairs as it pulls out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same pair of these since 7th grade, which was 12 years ago, and they are still amazing! These are definitely worth the investment. I&#x27;m about to purchase a pair for my sister for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I have really unruly, curly eyebrows. I also have awful little chin hairs. This works great for my eyebrows but the chin hairs are harder to get to with this tweezer without hurting/cutting my face.</li>
    <li> For that price, I was expecting a better grip. They are too sharp/pointy to use. I found some much better tweezers from Walmart at much better prices! Regrets of buying these!</li>
    <li> These work well, although there are some very fine hairs which it cannot grasp. I don&#x27;t know if any tweezers could grasp such hair, but I would of course like it it they could.</li>
    <li> The title says is all. Now I just have to figure out how to groom without injuring myself too severely.</li>
    <li> The tweezers came on time and as pictured. They grab hairs well, even the deep ones. However they seem to only pull from skin surface out, not pulling out root or part of hair below skin surface. They more seem to break hair off instead of pulling out well.</li>
    <li> Mostly pros:&lt;br /&gt;-they are really durable...so far&lt;br /&gt;-they work well as tweezers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-be careful, they are sharp, but come with a plastic safety cap</li>
    <li> I really use this for my various handiwork. The slanted edge works well and it&#x27;s narrow enough for many uses. I&#x27;ve used these to hold tiny computer screws into place as well as to peel layers of tape, etc.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman used to last me several years and I just replaced an old pair but these haven&#x27;t even lasted two months. I wish I could return them since now I have to get real tweezers (Rubis) and these were a waste of money. Sad- I used to love this product.</li>
    <li> I could grab things now and do what my fingernails can&#x27;t do.  No more frustrations trying to pull out the tiny things from places.</li>
    <li> Great tweezer for those pesky hairs.  Very well aligned.  The tweeze grabs the hairs and holds tight so you don&#x27;t have the hair jump back into your skin.</li>
    <li> This is the first tweezer I got so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to. I used to use salon services to thread my eyebrows. I now save $8 every two weeks and with the same results as threading. I love it!</li>
    <li> I used these to pluck ear hairs and the difference from the typical drugstore tweezers was unbelievable.  In other words; these tweezers really WORK WELL!  Gone will be the days of spending too much time trying to grasp a hair, as these tweezers were pulling out multiple hairs with each tug.  I&#x27;m very happy with these.  They are well worth the money.  I&#x27;m going to buy my daughter some Tweezerman products and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> After going through a bunch of department store products over the years, I decided to bite the bullet and get myself a decent pair of tweezers. I&#x27;ll admit that they are pricey, but worth it. They pull out the tiniest hairs that are just starting to poke through the skin. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This was more expensive than the usual tweezers I purchase but I gave it a chance.  Save your money, not worth the price</li>
    <li> Not too happy with this.  Not as firm grip as I would have liked</li>
    <li> These are truly good tweezers and I find using any others annoying. The slant format is really handy too. My only complaint is that mine were dropped and it left a dent in them so they don&#x27;t close as well anymore. It&#x27;d be nice if the steel was harder to deform.</li>
    <li> Once you buy these you won&#x27;t ever use any other tweezers again. These are seriously sharp and precise. It makes splinters and plucking so much easier and less painful. I have gone and purchased all Tweezerman tweezers as well as nail clippers and all of them have been A+</li>
    <li> Best out there.  I prefer the Slant model.</li>
    <li> I have bought several Tweezerman tweezers and they ALL break hairs! That is... those  hairs these tweezers actually can grip. Far too many hairs slide through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m flabbergasted. I keep reading about how wonderful they are... well, not for me. I have about six &amp;#34;granny hairs&amp;#34; - coarse beard hair that older women sprout. I&#x27;m NOT going around sporting six beard hairs on my chin! I have a few thin hairs on my upper lip that are a bit dark - these tweezers break those, too. Tweezerman breaks my hairs FAR more often than the much cheaper Revlon tweezer I bought - the Revlon is slanted and has rounded corners. THAT is the best tweezer I ever used. It never breaks hairs and easily accomplishes a firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Revlon-Tweezer-Slanted-Tip/dp/B001B8K1L8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1397325896&amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;revlon+tweezer</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever cut yourself trying to dig out a hair you can see growing through but can&#x27;t quite grab yet, you understand the importance of a sharp pair of tweezers. The pricetag is a bit offputting when compared to a drugstore brand, but this is truly a case where you get what you pay for. Spring for these and you&#x27;ll never have to buy another pair of tweezers again, unless you&#x27;re like me and purchased these for my mom.</li>
    <li> It can be easily seeing that this product is made from high quality material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is from far the best tweezer my mother and girlfriend ever had.</li>
    <li> this is almost perfect!  The tool works great in the fine nature of hair tweezing, although the soft nature of the finely tuned tweezing metal sometimes misses the mark.  protect the tip of this device for maximum effectiveness</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased these tweezers. They work far better than their cheaper counterparts. They are well worth their purchase price because they grab and hold even the tiniest finest hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Tweezerman Stainless Steel Slant Tweezers for over 10 years now. I liked that I could send them out free of charge sharpening when they would dull or I would accidentally drop them. In the last week I have purchased and returned 2 pairs because the slanted tip is too wide. They are no longer a fine sharp tip which was very useful in accessing stubborn hairs. The tweezer no longer successfully grabs the unwanted hair, instead, it slides off causing the hair, causing it to disappear under the skin, often resulting in hair follicle irritation or infection. For the price, they must to keep this product up to par. Not sure what else is out there.</li>
    <li> bought a cheap one at cvs and it couldn&#x27;t pluck out the finer eyebrow hairs. This one works wonders. I&#x27;ve had it for like a year now. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed Aesthetician who not only needs to have excellent tools in my practice but also consistently performing tweezers available to me everyday for my waxing and eyebrow shaping clients.  These have proven to be the best and even if I have to pay a couple of $ for shipping they are now the only ones I purchase and use!</li>
    <li> They feel very impressive in the hand but they seem to work well.  I tried them on tick removal and I think the pointy little revlon set works better for that, thank goodness.  However, I&#x27;m an old fart woman with one or two pesky little chin hairs that I can&#x27;t get with the pointy little revlon set until they reach manhood and I&#x27;m sure several people wanted to point them out for me.  But....  With the tweezerman set I can remove them almost as soon as I can feel them start.  In and of themselves, unimpressive.  The was they work, rather impressive.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite tweezers - the slant is perfect for a bigger area and you can also use the pointy tip for those onesies and twosies. Perfection!</li>
    <li> As others have said, this tweezer is amazing at finding the hard-to-get, thick, gnarly hairs or splinters which are just barely above the surface. But the tips are so precise, even though it’s a 90degree angle at the tip they are like knives for thin and wispy hairs. If you pull with any angle, the well-machined edges slice through. That would be fine if I could find the base of the hair and pull it near the skin, since they are so fine nobody’s going to see them but I am used to my dull tweezers being able to grab quite a few up above my eyebrows and yank them all at once. This requires me to take more time. It’s good I have these for the jobs that need it, but I’ll be keeping my old, blunted pair in my toolkit as well.</li>
    <li> Works 100% better than the ones from Revlon that i own.</li>
    <li> These tweezers grab small hairs but don&#x27;t hold on to them. They&#x27;re very sharp and dangerous to boot. I&#x27;m sorry I bought them.</li>
    <li> Although these tweezers were quite a bit more expensive than I&#x27;d ever paid, they work superbly! I&#x27;m hard pressed to find a hair that they cannot manage to pick, ingrown hairs included. They also feel like they&#x27;re high quality, and with good care I hope these last for many years.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them.  They are a tad on the expensive side but the brand really pulls through because the quality is so great and they last forever!</li>
    <li> Whenever I get a new one I realize what a big difference it makes when it&#x27;s really sharp.  I&#x27;m keeping the little plastic top on the tip in between uses to protect it from drops.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers ever.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Finally tweezers that actually work.  They are can be a little pinchy if not careful but are excellent for tweezing small hairs.  Love them.</li>
    <li> Overpriced.  Nothing better than many regular tweezers. Doesn&#x27;t  have the &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; tension I prefer.</li>
    <li> Love these. They are sharper than typical cheap tweezers making it easier to remove things like splinters.</li>
    <li> Good product, but buy two. Family members will steal them and not give them back. Should be a bit cheaper for Chinese made item.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an expensive little thing, but it does the job.  I used to have no problems with tweezing even the smallest hairs, but have been very frustrated with the last few tweezers I bought.  Since I could not remember the brand I used to have, I went with ratings on the Amazon site.  Everyone liked Tweezerman and they were right.</li>
    <li> Does not work better for fine hairs than my $3 drugstore tweezers and has a tendency to break hairs off. These are going to the back of my drawer to collect dust. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought these hoping they would snag those really tiny, barely there black hairs under my eyebrows.  I had a pair of slanted revlon tweezers that cost $12 and these work just as good as those.  Based on the reviews I thought these would be something amazing, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited 54 years to finally get a good pair of tweezers. I hope they don&#x27;t get borrowed by someone cuz they will never return them, I know I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife for Christmas. She has always loved Tweezerman&#x27;s tweezers. And this pair was exactly what she wanted.&lt;br /&gt;No problems with item and no hassles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT BE VERY CAREFUL PURCHASING FROM BaBings.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased an item from BaBings and received a confirmation of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The next day I received an email that my item had shipped, along with a UPS tracking number.&lt;br /&gt;Several hours later on the same day, I received another email that I was being refunded my&lt;br /&gt;purchase amount, because the “Item was out of stock”. I wen to the UPS Tracking website to see that&lt;br /&gt;the shipper “Voided the Tracking Number created”.&lt;br /&gt;Several days later I went back on Amazon to see the identical item back for sale with a the same quantity of ‘3’.&lt;br /&gt;Only this time the price was considerably more money.&lt;br /&gt;If BaBings mispriced the item, they should have honored my purchase and update the Amazon price.&lt;br /&gt;Not an honest way for a third party seller to do business on Amazon.</li>
    <li> These tweezers worked well. There were a few close hairs that i couldn&#x27;t get. They aren&#x27;t the best that i have tried, but are o.k.</li>
    <li> Tweezers that actually tweeze!!!</li>
    <li> Tweezerman makes the best tweezers, they are more expensive but worth every penny.  They will also sharpen them for you free if charge.</li>
    <li> I like this tweezer compared to my other ones because it can pull out the almost impossible hairs that my old ones could not.&lt;br /&gt;The tip is slanted and when closed, the edges touch perfectly making its grip on hair better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there is a little plastic piece that covers the tip to protect it from damage.&lt;br /&gt;so far, this is my favorite tweezer :)</li>
    <li> I listened to the reviews, watched the commercials, and even looked them up on Google. I have NO idea what all the hype is about. It takes a very long time to pull even big hairs. It&#x27;s very hard to use, and I have been plucking my eyebrows for years with the normal sissor-like tweezers, that have served me so well.</li>
    <li> They are real tweezers. Grab a  splinter or hair with em and they will rip it out. Precision made to work like u expect them too.</li>
    <li> Great tweezer!! Better than I expected based on the bad reviews... I was lucky because mine work wonders!!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, slim and precise... I love them!</li>
    <li> These are by far the most expensive tweezers we&#x27;ve ever bought. You can definitely feel the difference in quality. They are nice and sharp and grip really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they we&#x27;re a little cheaper I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate at all.</li>
    <li> The tweezers are great. They have held their sharp edges for over a year now (only use them about once every two weeks).</li>
    <li> After buying many useless tweezers that do not grab single hairs this one works flawlessly to do what it was intended to do</li>
    <li> Plucks amazingly well. I don&#x27;t have to tug at my hairs and risk pulling out skin. These tweezers let me put in minimal effort to get my eyebrows to look polished</li>
    <li> Needed em, bought em, and was rather impressed with the quality, which was just a little better than I expected.  I had read a few reviews on these and the other nicer tweezers, decided on these, and the reviewers were fairly spot on. I guess I had just figured that people who write reviews on tweezers might not be playing with a full deck, and you know what I mean, maybe a little dumb, kinda funny looking, but just real happy to have new tweezers. But after using mine to pluck a couple of ear hairs that my regular tweezers couldn&#x27;t grip, I changed my opinion of funny looking tweezer reviewers. Oh, I got the black ones.  They match my cars. And those ear hairs, they were imbedded like an Alabama tick.  I&#x27;m healing pretty good, and I can still hear all of the voices in my head. I&#x27;m pretty sure I can use these tweezers as stump pullers in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I was kind of expecting a laser show, but it&#x27;s definitely the best tweezers I&#x27;ve had. Worth $20? Eh... sure?</li>
    <li> I bought this as well as the pointy Tweezerman tweezers. They BOTH are wonderful tweezers: the best I have ever bought. Well worth the extra money. Drugstore tweezers can&#x27;t begin to compare! Between the two I bought, fine hairs don&#x27;t have a chance.</li>
    <li> I used to use a set of Revlon tweezers that I thought were great, until I used these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers are amazing. I am able to grip even the smallest, nearly invisible hairs and pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am totally satisfied with them. Some people have said it&#x27;s hard to get them sharpened etc, but honestly, if I have to buy a new pair every year or two, I&#x27;m fine with that. These make plucking hairs a treat instead of a chore.</li>
    <li> I have always thought that I have a good tweezers n i was always afraid of losing it but Hell no  i was wrong  my previous tweezers is nothing comparing to this  this one really grab or pluck hair easily n without any pain  I use it on my eyebrow  n i believe i wont need to go to the salon much often  if you are thinking about this one  deferentially give it a try  I got it from ebay almost the same price as amazon but much cheaper than the drugstore n the shipping was by canada post which i prefer</li>
    <li> Great product .  Very precise and for fine use.</li>
    <li> Ive been through 4 pairs of different store bought tweezers before I finally shucked 20 bucks for these. Totally worth it. These things can grab anything. They are definitely expensive, but you really are paying for a quality pair of tweezers thats going to last you.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite tweezers :)</li>
    <li> This Tweezer is a MUST have! It&#x27;s good quality and worth every penny. I would recommend them to anybody I know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman, which means I&#x27;ve got hair in places I&#x27;m apparently not supposed to have hair, like on my upper lip or between my eyebrows. Scandalous. I&#x27;ve been tweezing strays for years, and after my last move, I couldn&#x27;t find my Revlon tweezers. The only other pair I had were too old and dull to be useful for anything. I haven&#x27;t needed to buy new tweezers in years, so for the first time, I actually took the time to figure out what the best tweezers really were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not happy to spend more than $10 on them ... until they arrived. These guys are VERY sharp--be careful. They also have pretty amazing grip. With my old tweezers, if I felt a coarse hair I wanted to tweeze, I had to wait a few days before it would be long enough; these tweezers can grab one as soon as I feel it. I don&#x27;t have to try repeatedly to tweeze a hair because they rarely lose their grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come with a little cap to keep the tips from getting dulled or to keep me from accidentally stabbing myself with them when they&#x27;re not in use. I hear Tweezerman offers resharpening as long as you have the tweezers, which is great.</li>
    <li> very nice tweezers, high quality and seem like they will last along time. will post if any issues arise</li>
    <li> The product arrived as advertised and on time.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Great Seller!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good tweezer and it seems I found one.  I misplaced my old one and probably that was a good thing.  I love this tweezer.  It is easy to handle and the tips are great even for the finest little hair.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These get every stubborn short hair in my eyebrows, have great grip, and are not so sharp that they nick and cut soft skin.  Love them!</li>
    <li> These are simply the best tweezers ever.  Whether it&#x27;s unwanted hair, a splinter or whatever, Tweezerman has got your back.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are good. They are easy to hold, and work on thick and thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have had them for a while and they still work like new.</li>
    <li> This product work beautifully.  I was really sad when my expensive German tweezers got crushed, thinking I&#x27;d have to spend a lot to replace them.  The Tweezerman works even better, and is very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Pricey but the \\&quot;definitive\\&quot; tweezer set $18.  Good grip, sharp pointed.  Shame it doesn&#x27;t have a leather case.  Worth the money unless you lose these.</li>
    <li> Good product. I am very satisfied purchasing it</li>
    <li> Excellent Tweezerman quality. Has remained perfect even after carrying around in my makeup bag. Love all my Tweezerman products!</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers.  Very strong and never slip!!</li>
    <li> I use them to prune my eyebrows. They&#x27;re expensive but worth it, in terms of precision and longevity (they stay algined). I have not found another tweezer brand that can beat Tweezerman!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore Tweezerman tweezers, and these were no exception: ultra sharp, ultra precise, perfect for grabbing even the most ultra-fine brow hairs. I highly recommend these to people who have owned and had trouble with &#x27;budget&#x27; tweezers that don&#x27;t really do the job. These are pricier, but worth every cent. Plus, it&#x27;s nice that sharpening is free. Tweezerman really goes the extra mile to show that they stand behind their product. I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> I had a ton of annoying ingrown hairs and I&#x27;d happy to announce that they&#x27;re all gone and are no longer a thorn in my side. These tweezers are extremely effective, and like most have mentioned, can extract the smalles of hairs. My left cheek was inundated with ingrown hairs that caused a lot of itching and irritation. I used to attempt to shave directly over the area, but for a while I noticed the hairs were still there. Shaving did nothing because the hairs were growing back into my skin as opposed to outwards. They weren&#x27;t exposing themselves so I missed them every time I did a pass through with my razor. Once I got ahold of the Tweezerman, my life was saved. The hairs no longer grow back into my skin and the irritation is gone. Skin is clearing up by the week. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Good product, purchased to replace my old tweezerman tweezers.  Free lifetime sharpening is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Like these tweezers a lot. Would buy them again. They do they trick and get the finer hard to pluck hairs.</li>
    <li> Very good tweezers.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman Stainless Tweezer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezer is going to take time to get use to as I have not used a slant tweezer, but once I get use to them they will be fine.</li>
    <li> I used this probably every day. I use it to pluck any air that I don&#x27;t like lol. I use it a lot in the below region.</li>
    <li> I had a couple of tweezers laying around the house that I used to use and was never fully satisfied. The tweezers would slip off the hairs all the time. I did some research and found these guys and haven&#x27;t looked back since. 15$ might seem like a lot for tweezers but the quality can&#x27;t be matched.</li>
    <li> very accurate and awesome tweezers. you can pick the smallest hair anywhere on your skin. I has very sharp edges to help you pick up the hair. very happy.</li>
    <li> very good quality tweezer though its little expensive. If you can spend money then buy it. points are little sharp be careful when u use it.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are the best I&#x27;ve ever used. They are able to grasp multiple pigment-less superfine hairs, nearly without fail. They are comfortable to use, and are of excellent quality craftsmanship.    EDIT:    It should be noted, the edges do dull with use/wear and although become less impressive are still effective.  I would recommend keeping the rubber sleeve on the tips.</li>
    <li> It is no better than what you buy at drug store! I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used! Gets hairs that have hardly emerged!</li>
    <li> Effortlessly grabs eyebrow hairs.</li>
    <li> Easy to pinch your skin while using it.  Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it grabs hair relatively well.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, these tweezers are a lot better than my wife&#x27;s tweezers. They grab the hair every time. Tweezers are worth the money. Free sharpening service details on their web site.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for an old very high quality tweezer that does not have the brand imprinted on it anywhere. I was sure that this well-known (and somewhat expensive) brand would be very similar. However, I have to say that this one is only adequate. It will not grasp the very fine eyebrows hairs that I am going after.  So I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
    <li> These are some high quality tweezers. will probably be my only ones I will ever need.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bit sharp but does most of what everyone says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m male and use it to keep my eyebrows clean but I&#x27;ve cut myself sometimes using it.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to get myself a new pair of Tweezerman tweezers and love the convenience of Amazon being a new Mom.  These were not the real thing!  I only use Tweezerman and these were not crafted the same.  They did not even work!  I sent them back right away.  The good thing I can say is that Amazon is awesome with returns.  I was bummed these did not work out.  I have since bought new ones at a beauty supply store near my home for a little more money but it&#x27;s worth getting the real thing!!</li>
    <li> My favorite....best on the market!</li>
    <li> I love Tweezerman but these just would not fit together properly.</li>
    <li> We lost our original tweezers, which for a bushy eye browned gal like me, is scary.  I was in desperate need of finding a suitable replacement soon.  I had never been in the market for tweezers, so I decided to shop Amazon reviews.  I found these tweezers and they were the overall best rated tweezers.  I was considering buying them, but the price shocked me.  Again in need of maintaining my eyebrows, I reluctantly purchased them.  Shortly after my purchase, we found our original tweezers. I debated about cancelling my order, but then I tried tweezerman and I am so happy with my purchase.  They grab a hold of the impossible fine hairs and are very precise in grabbing the right hair, instead of all the wrong hairs around the one you want to get.  They are very sharp, but I have come to real that is very important in order to get the firm grasp and the hair you need.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Well, yes this was a great buy,  there was no disappointment here, it does what it supposed too. I love it. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> They are tweezers so its not like they can blow someone away but i really like em. They have a cool black painted finish and are easy to hold. I guess that makes them great tweezers!</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers! They work very well and I would recommend them to anyone. I have always had Tweezerman tweezers and the only reason I needed this new pair was because I lost my old ones.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I&#x27;ve used it a long time.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers. Sharp, well aligned, exactly what you need.</li>
    <li> These things are amazing. you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever used other tweezers.</li>
    <li> very good set, able to pull hairs that I was not able to get at but minus one star for the price</li>
    <li> work perfectly would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Not as good as I was hoping for but from the other products I have reviewed this seems to be as good as your going to get. For the most part it will grab any thick hair. Thinner hairs without color are harder to grab and sometimes break. They are sharp</li>
    <li> These tweezers are high quality and worth the money. The pluck easily and the are made to last. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Sharp, great tool for a ladies makeup bag. Definitely worth the little extra $</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure the price would be justified for a set of tweezers, but I was wrong.  These are accurate and effective, a very nice set.  Was using an old inexpensive set that took a long time to use well.  By comparison these have a very fine sharp point that make them grab small hair very well.  These are simply great to use.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband because his old tweezers were awful. I put them in his stocking for Christmas, and this is the gift he has raved about since! He said, &amp;#34;I know that if you have the right tool that it makes the job so much easier...I just didn&#x27;t know it applied to tweezers too!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Worth every penny.  I have a ceramic one also but the ceramic one ended up losing it&#x27;s sharpness.  This steel one is much better.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by the quality and sharpness. It&#x27;s not worth the 15 bucks. The fancy packaging is deceiving. Thanks</li>
    <li> What can a person say!?  They tweeze very well!  These tweezers have been (obviously) ground down with a precision machine.  If you want a set that will last and get the small stuff, this is your set.</li>
    <li> After many cheap and not so cheap tweezers, here are some that actually work. Very precise and easy to use.</li>
    <li> best tweezer out there</li>
    <li> These things make other tweezers look foolish</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! At times it does cut hair due to the sharp tips, but rarely happens, so it doesn&#x27;t deserve to have a star taken off. I do recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd. Tweezerman slant tweezer and the last one.  My first one was very good and worth the money. I bought a second one and had the first sent off for sharpening. It came back as dull as before. I wonder if they did anything. The second new tweezer worked well but when that got dull  I was afraid to get it sharpened after the first experience. So I bought a third and this one is dull. I figure I&#x27;ll buy a cheaper brand In the future if I want one of this dull quality</li>
    <li> Many tweezers are not effective but this one is excellent.  I gave it as a gift and it was appreciated.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really decided if I love these or not, sometimes they work amazing and sometimes it takes me 8 tries to pluck one hair. I&#x27;m not sure if my eyebrows are just super thick and stubborn or if maybe the tweezers aren&#x27;t as amazing as everyone claims. Either way, they&#x27;ve last longer than all my others!</li>
    <li> Previous customers were correct in that it may be &amp;#34;too sharp&amp;#34;, i find that it has a bit of difficulty gripping small hairs without completely cutting them.</li>
    <li> It gets where no tweezer has gone before!  And it holds tight and pulls with success!</li>
    <li> I have bought these for myself and for presents.  They really work.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re the best tweezers I&#x27;ve every had.  They will pluck the hairs that you can barely see!  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> they are average tweezers and not as good as they were said to be. i feel cheated and if i could i would ship my used tweezers back to them.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work really well; so well that my ex girlfriend stole them from me. Only gets a 4 out of 5 star review because they work great, but your bitch of an ex will probably just end up stealing them from you.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman creates the best tweezers! These tweezers grab the hair and making plucking less painful. They are extremely sharp and are very easy to clamp down. The slant tip is great for getting hairs in different places. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Still work well after a year. I dropped it several time and did not cause any damage. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Very well made tool and does its job well. It is easy to hold and is a great upgrade from the cheap tweezers.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers ever! They are very sharp and can grab even the finest hairs. I&#x27;ve been using them for a year and they still work great. I am officially a loyal tweezerman customer.</li>
    <li> they work, but they are not awesome. too expensive! I prefer my pharmacy revlon tweezers. they work better, and get short, thin hair.</li>
    <li> I say loved it but sadly someone took it from hotel room last year.  So I had to buy another one.  I ended buying 2 - one for my make-up table and a mini one for my purse.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work better than any other tweezers I&#x27;ve ever tweezed with.  I haven&#x27;t had to send them back for sharpening, but I understand they&#x27;ll do that for you, free of charge.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly- a day sooner than expected. These are good quality and efficient. Good product.</li>
    <li> Best tweezer I have ever used.  Wish I had known about it years ago.  It costs a little more than others, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Yes i know, why me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently got into taking excellent care of my grooming habits and realized my eyebrows were kind of whack. Well the tweezers I had at home were not exactly good so I went ahead and purchased these. Best decision I made (for the sake of my facial hair) and enjoy how &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; the grip is on these things. Makes everything 100x better and is even great for removing annoying wood/metal splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys it&#x27;s okay to pluck your eyebrows. Anything that makes you more attractive to the opposite (or same, I don&#x27;t mind!) sex or as a person in general is A okay in my book.</li>
    <li> I tried many products and all failed me. This one is the real deal. I actually got 2.</li>
    <li> Got this, wasn&#x27;t sure if it could really be worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the generic drugstore tweezers (revlon, whatever) and was always unhappy with their inability to grab tiny hairs (stupid ears).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got these delivered and WOW what a difference.  i&#x27;ve yet to find a pesky hair these couldn&#x27;t remove.These are precise enough that if you pull a hair with them, you better get rid of it before you try to pull another one, or you won&#x27;t be able to grab the new hair (these are that precision ground, a single hair will keep them from touching!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been careful not to drop these, as some reviews say they may come out of alignment if you do.  Overall, these are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> A friend told be about these.  They grab stuff much better than any other brand of tweezers I&#x27;ve had before.  Must be something they do to the surface area of the grabby part.  Anyhow, these are about 1000 times better than your typical tweez.</li>
    <li> I bought this tweezer a while ago, love it. It is still sharp, works like new and those ergonomically designed handles are so comfortable and practical. This is the only tweezer you would need as long as you won&#x27;t lose it!</li>
    <li> This tweezer will find and grab the smallest hair.  It comes with a plastic protector for the tip.  Well made.</li>
    <li> Very nice tweezers if you can manage to hang onto them.  I&#x27;ve now bought three pairs of these....the women in the house keep stealing them, and I never see them again.  They have a very precise edge and will grab onto the smallest hair or splinter.</li>
    <li> Good tweezer, used this product for years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much all hype you guys. Don&#x27;t get pulled in like I did. They&#x27;re just tweezers.. and they hurt. I very much prefer my Lacrosse tweezers to these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used cheap tweezers for years before my little brother told me about this brand.  This little guy usually gets the hairs on the first try.  Really a good tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Small&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy&lt;br /&gt;Efficient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
    <li> Well-made, and does its thing -tweezing</li>
    <li> Yes, they work. I lost them and bought them again</li>
    <li> Wish they were the teeniest bit shorter to fit my smaller hand. But otherwise perfect. Very precise.</li>
    <li> great choice for great tweezers</li>
    <li> a tweezer that pulls out even the shortest hairs. I&#x27;ve finally found my holy grail.</li>
    <li> They work great and have solid construction</li>
    <li> i was expecting a much better product for the amount of money I paid. The tweezers are made of very thin material and are flimsy.</li>
    <li> Nice and sleek. Got the tweezer in black. Good grip but lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mainly use to gently grab any flaking skin on my face. :D</li>
    <li> This set of tweezers are great. I&#x27;ve been using them for about a week now and really look forward to using them when they are required. I had a set of generic brand tweezers and it was very frustrating trying to use them for anything at all.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Does not work well like the first pink one I bought. Disappointed</li>
    <li> These are very good tweezers. You can pluck those hairs that are barely starting to sprout, and The grip on these is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care of them and they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
    <li> A couple of years ago I had received free Tweezerman tweezers from Sephora and I loved them. Recently I lost them while flying. I ordered the [[ASIN:B00AV21G3C OceanPure Stainless Steel Slant Tip Tweezer (Pink)]] as they were inexpensive but I got what I paid for. Those tweezers wouldn&#x27;t pull out any hair. That&#x27;s when I decided to order the Tweezerman tweezers again. I started yanking out hair as soon as I got them and they work really well. I totally recommend these.</li>
    <li> It always has to be TWEEZERMAN, nothing else. Great product. Good price ! Thanks!</li>
    <li> After a few months the tip bent and it was useless. You would expect it to be a stronger metal.</li>
    <li> Rusted after a few months in my dop kit.... They do indeed rust.</li>
    <li> These are great for pulling out hairs and are very sharp. I would definitely buy them again. They line up perfectly.</li>
    <li> came in on time and they did a great job thanks</li>
    <li> As far as performance goes, these tweezers are great. They will latch on to even the finest of hairs. However, the tips of them are quite sharp, and you have to be very careful not to pinch or poke your skin with them. The tips are filed very thin (almost razor thin), as to get a good grip on hairs and can be somewhat uncomfortable to use, particularly on the delicate eye area. Therefore, I do find myself reaching for my regular tweezers more often, especially if I am in a hurry, simply because I don&#x27;t have to be as careful with them. :)</li>
    <li> Tweezer man is the best by far!</li>
    <li> Stop messing with those cheap tweezers from the store, these made pulling sliver out a breeze. Heavy duty,great materials, and they even look cool!</li>
    <li> The good news: this is the best pair of tweezers I have ever owned. The bad news: as a man ages, he has more need of a good pair; hair seems to forget where it&#x27;s suppose to grow.</li>
    <li> nice and excellent. Love this product. it&#x27;s deliver as mentioned duration. so take your time to get this item.&lt;br /&gt;-HP</li>
    <li> I purpicly looked for the most expensive Tweezer I could find because the cheaper ones never seemed to be effective.  These are terriffic and well worth the money</li>
    <li> i had a tweezerman tweezer which my friend gave it to me.&lt;br /&gt;it was so great.&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s why i bought one here for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately, it&#x27;s totally different from the one sold by Sephora store.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s few dollar less than Sephora, but it&#x27;s still tooooo much than it&#x27;s quality.&lt;br /&gt;i really don&#x27;t understand why it has so high review stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy it. and returning process is unknown too.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers! Grabs any hair that needs tweezed. Only complaint is that it grabs skin too, leaving red marks where the skin was broken. They are very good tweezer thou, just have to be careful not to over due it, leaving red marks and sores.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the BEST tweezers after reading reviews on Amazon and on the Web. They are good, but they definitely are not the best. They do not grab the hair &amp;#34;the first time, every time&amp;#34;, like they advertise, and even following their instructions on how to tweeze, sometimes the hairs break in half making them impossible to plug until they grow out a little more.&lt;br /&gt;The ends are too think. You really need something with finer points to get the smaller, hard to reach hairs.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for-work as one would expect.</li>
    <li> After reading such great reviews I expected some good tweezers.. These did not meet my expectations. I prefer the kind of tweezers that grab hair firmly and yank it out properly and easily. These are so sharp that they break the hairs. I pull on a hair, and instead of the hair coming out of the skin with the tweezer, the tweezer just takes part of the hair. Maybe these are just hard to use. They are not good for hair removal, but I will say that they are sharp and precise. I guess I will save them for splinters.</li>
    <li> These are a solid pair of tweezers that I would happily buy again... Thankfully I won&#x27;t need to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use tweezers in our house. Not a lot, but a bit more than the average household. And we&#x27;re always losing them. The only set of tweezers we don&#x27;t lose are the crappy cheap ones we purchased rom Walgreens. They&#x27;re flimsy and difficult to grab hair or splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these tweezers are AWESOME! The construction is solid, the grip is great and they have a nice edge to them. Hair? No problem. Splinters? Easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the warranty looks to be very impressive. I have not had a need to contact them yet, but if I do, I&#x27;ll happily update my review!</li>
    <li> Nothing special about these. Got a pair at stop and shop that work better</li>
    <li> Great item fast shipping only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 is I would have liked a bigger slant on tip</li>
    <li> The Tweezerman tweezers are the best. I&#x27;ve tried other popular brands, but needed another pair because my daugher took my old Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
    <li> I have several of these (bathroom, vanity, purse), so I&#x27;m sure to always have one on hand.  Tweezerman is the best!</li>
    <li> I have tried many slanted tweezers, the best brand is still Rubis from Switzerland. The Tweezerman that i received is slightly &amp;#34;warped&amp;#34; at where the two blades meet, because of that it is &amp;#34;looped&amp;#34; sided and does not handle well. I am not sure it is just the one that I received or it is a design problem, but I think it is over rated and just so so.</li>
    <li> bought these tweezer and they are not worth the extra money I shelled out. They do not grab even the thicker hairs without a few tries. I have other tweezers that are simple and painless, but these are actually painful considering how many tries i have to do in order to pull out these hairs.</li>
    <li> Not one of those cheap products found at Walmart, etc.  You get what you pay for and these tweezers are worth the money.</li>
    <li> First time I used these, it made my face look like one of those amazon boxes with the big smile on it. These clippers grab the hair with ease and pulls them out even easier. They look cool, feel great, and come with a storage case and a tip cover. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these clippers.  You will save time and smile more.</li>
