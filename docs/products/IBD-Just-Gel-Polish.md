      <li>I was so excited to purchase my first set of gel polishes and lamp.</li>
      <li>I thought maybe it was just an old bottle; but now I see how many people had problems, I won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
      <li>Apply a really, really thin layer to get the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>product at first to me was a dud.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>I did quite a lot of looking around, decided on IBD due to their good reviews and purchased all IBD items plus my new curing lamp to get the job done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is great if you only need it for a few days.</li>
      <li>It seals my nails and really shines.  </li>
      <li>I have never tired a product like this before.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s the stuff that really insures that your manicure stays on for the advertised two weeks.</li>
      <li>I even purchased the ibd intense seal.</li>
      <li>My review is on the whole experience of the product and Seller</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, was delivered before the system could even catch up ..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
      <li>Goes on thick but cures good.</li>
      <li>Then I tried it on my overlay and it was tacky, much more tacky than other</li>
      <li>The polish just doesn&#x27;t form a nice hard finish like others I&#x27;ve had applied.  </li>
      <li>, my IBD top coat has developed large stringy chunks of dried polish inside the bottle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It dries at a normal pace</li>
      <li>It came way earlier than expected, and I was satisfied.</li>
      <li>I received it with large dry clumps of gel stuck on the brush that I had to pull off in order to use it for the first time, and throughout the bottle.</li>
      <li>This product is a huge waste of time.....</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since then, I have tried every conceivable combination of preparation and curing to try to get this system to stick.</li>
      <li>(Never mind that the real Marigold flower is deep orange!)  </li>
      <li>Poor quality gel, doesn&#x27;t cure well and will peel off instead of being a nice hardened gel finish.</li>
      <li>By comparison, the longest I have ever gotten IBD to stay on (using the exact same technique, during the same time-frame) is 5 days.</li>
      <li>My first attempt was messier than I expected</li>
      <li>, all the nails have peeled back at the tip, and three are off completely.  </li>
      <li>But I had it professionally applied and just 5 days later</li>
      <li>The brush is pretty wide and short which makes spreading it evenly a challenge.</li>

<li> Unfortunately very disappointed with this gel top coat.</li>

    <li> Poor quality gel, doesn&#x27;t cure well and will peel off instead of being a nice hardened gel finish.</li>
    <li> Great lasts for weeks</li>
    <li> This product is a huge waste of time.....I love the gelish product and just wanted to give something new a try....Take my advice DON&amp;#34;T it peeled of with in 24 hours!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Works great, nice shine and good price. I&#x27;ve used CND mostly, but decided to give this a try. I&#x27;m very pleased with this and my nails look great!</li>
    <li> I got the IBD line when I bought my Epica double wide nail dryer. It&#x27;s awesome. It really doesn&#x27;t chip. Even when my nails break, the polish hasn&#x27;t chipped. It hasn&#x27;t done me wrong, but I really suggest that you get the IBD bonder, that&#x27;s the stuff that really insures that your manicure stays on for the advertised two weeks.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately very disappointed with this gel top coat. I received it with large dry clumps of gel stuck on the brush that I had to pull off in order to use it for the first time, and throughout the bottle. It is VERY thick and hard to work with. The brush is pretty wide and short which makes spreading it evenly a challenge. It pulled off my nails within a day. The bottle is large in size, but even that isn&#x27;t a plus because it is so clumpy and thick that it is unusable.</li>
    <li> the price maybe its good, but, it needs a lot of time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;its good for beginners. lol lol</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all... It is very hard to get it dry, I have to wait around  30 minutes and still doesn&#x27;t work..&lt;br /&gt;Also this product leave my nails very sticky!!!! ...</li>
    <li> Yes! I love this gel polish! I use it all the time! This is the second bottle that I have purchased! The shipping time was reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this gel polish.  Just the right size, easy to handle bottle.  Speedy shipping!  A+++++</li>
    <li> excellent shine and long lasting.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. It came way earlier than expected, and I was satisfied.</li>
    <li> My review is on the whole experience of the product and Seller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, was delivered before the system could even catch up ..next day ! Great shipping. It arrived packaged perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product&lt;br /&gt;This product at first to me was a dud. I wanted to seal my polish ( Non UV Polish) which I do with my other UV coats. This product DOES NOT work with regular nail polish :(. Then I tried it on my overlay and it was tacky, much more tacky than other brands.&lt;br /&gt;It dries at a normal pace&lt;br /&gt;The shine is a great luster shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to use rubbing alcohol once you set the UV coat to remove the excess product build up and to remove the tackiness. Apply a really, really thin layer to get the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking a for a Top coat for your solar nails, natural nails and or overlays without polish this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a Top coat that will seal and secure ANY Polish..try Gelish or Seche brands.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good gel top coat to put on over polish or just by itself.  This top coat works great and keeps my nails strong and looking good!</li>
    <li> For those saying that there polish starts to peel right off, it is because you need a gel topcoat! PLEASE BUY A GEL TOPCOAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY A GEL COLOR NAIL POLISH!</li>
    <li> It  hardened up upon opening and trying to apply. Even the brush wouldn&#x27;t come out after one use. I have never tired a product like this before.</li>
    <li> One of the best  gel topcoats I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually glad to see all the other negative reviews saying that the IBD Gel Polish peels off in just a few days.  I thought maybe it was just an old bottle; but now I see how many people had problems, I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I&#x27;m heartbroken--the Marigold color is a beautiful red/pink blend that is the perfect color--really brightens my skin tone.  (Never mind that the real Marigold flower is deep orange!)  But I had it professionally applied and just 5 days later, all the nails have peeled back at the tip, and three are off completely.  And I haven&#x27;t been working hard or washing ANY dishes.  The polish just doesn&#x27;t form a nice hard finish like others I&#x27;ve had applied.  What a shame--no one else has anything like this color</li>
    <li> I use this over my gel polish and also over regular polish to extend the wear time.  It seals my nails and really shines.  Easy to cure under an LED nail lamp.</li>
    <li> Nice staff. I love it.</li>
    <li> Purchased the top coat. Was cautious cause of the cheap price. Goes on thick but cures good. Not so shiny though, but that may be my fault. Would recommend</li>
    <li> I was so excited to purchase my first set of gel polishes and lamp. I did quite a lot of looking around, decided on IBD due to their good reviews and purchased all IBD items plus my new curing lamp to get the job done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve to doing your own gel polish. My first attempt was messier than I expected and I had two nails&#x27; polish peel off because I accidentally left it touching my skin. No big deal - I corrected the problem and reapplied. The next day four more nails&#x27; worth of polish peeled off. 9 out of 10 came off by the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have tried every conceivable combination of preparation and curing to try to get this system to stick. It doesn&#x27;t. The kicker is that I borrowed a friend&#x27;s gel polish kit (different brand) and ran a side-by-side comparison. Her SensatioNail polish stayed on for more than two weeks, and was chip free for 12 days. By comparison, the longest I have ever gotten IBD to stay on (using the exact same technique, during the same time-frame) is 5 days. I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top things off, despite only two weeks of use, my IBD top coat has developed large stringy chunks of dried polish inside the bottle. It wrecks the finish and must be fished off the nail or else it will set if cured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very careful with my product, and I expect that if you claim a polish will last two weeks, it will nearly meet that claim. I also expect that if a polish is labeled with a 24 month shelf life expectancy it will not suffer consistency degradation after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Okay I thought it was me. Thought I was doing something wrong. I, like others whose reviews I just read, have tried everything too. Nothing works to keep this topcoat on!!! I even purchased the ibd intense seal. I tried using it with the base and top coat....peeled. tried buffing my nails until they burned in the lamp....peeled.  and when I say peeled,  I mean RIGHT AWAY. I have a harmony gelish led lamp, I thought it was defective! ! It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s this topcoat and base from ibd. I don&#x27;t know how people can actually write a review giving this 5 stars. Every time I do my nails with this I can lift the entire polished nail off in one shot. Don&#x27;t buy this. Someone please tell me what the best one is n who I should buy it from.</li>
    <li> This is great if you only need it for a few days. I wore mine for almost a week and it flaked off. The one my nail salon uses never flakes off</li>
    <li> Perfect gel top coat that can be used for applying gems to the nails as well!</li>
    <li> Comes off within the first 24 hours.  Unable to get a refund because I bought it before I needed it.  Money in the trash!</li>
