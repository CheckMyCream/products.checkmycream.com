      <li>I used UltraSwim in the showers right after swimming, and it severely reduced the smell of chlorine.</li>
      <li>It seems to take a lot of product though - I have to use a lot more of it than I would regular shampoo.</li>
      <li>This product really gets the chlorine out of our swim suits and leaves them smelling very fresh with only 2 capfuls.</li>
      <li>Got to me rather quickly, and it does exactly what it claims to do, remove the chlorine, and leaves the hair feeling clean and soft, not like a person was using some harsh chemical.</li>
      <li>Does a decent job of pulling the chlorine smell from my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, works as advertised - highly recommended for swimmers</li>

<li> Regular washing with detergent does not get chlorine out of your suits and leaves them smelling musty, not to mention stretched out when you run them through the washer.</li>
<li> UltraSwim does what it&#x27;s supposed to, chlorine left in the hair is not a good thing.</li>
<li> The smell is a little off-putting while washing</li>

    <li> Does a decent job of pulling the chlorine smell from my hair. It seems to take a lot of product though - I have to use a lot more of it than I would regular shampoo. The smell is a little off-putting while washing but I use a non-UltraSwim conditioner and that seems to take care of the shampoo smell.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic and it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
    <li> Good at getting out the chlorine.</li>
    <li> I like the way my hair feels after I wash with this stuff. It smells good too.</li>
    <li> great product, nice smell, my daughters love it!</li>
    <li> This works! I swim at LA Fitness and my beard, hair, and skin always smells like chlorine for about 2 days after the last swim. I&#x27;ve tried different shampoos and soaps to no avail. I used UltraSwim in the showers right after swimming, and it severely reduced the smell of chlorine. I always take another shower later in the day after the shower at LA Fitness, so by the end of the day I actually don&#x27;t smell any chlorine when I use UltraSwim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, works as advertised - highly recommended for swimmers</li>
    <li> Nice &amp; clarifying ....clear not milky like it used to be used ago.  Like it instead of the chlorine smell!</li>
