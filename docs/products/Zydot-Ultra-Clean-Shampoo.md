<li> So sorry if you believe all the positive reviews.</li>
<li> If you use heavily  I really couldn&#x27;t say how the product works for the ones of you said that you failed .</li>
<li> Drugs suck and not worth it ever..</li>

<li> Did 2 applications in 12 hours on long, dark, thick hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work kids... I had to do a follicle test after receiving an offer from a Fortune 100 company. I did the Jerry G method. I even bleached/dyed my hair three times and used Toxin Wash each time. I have little body hair, so all of the hair was taken from my head. Don&#x27;t waste your money, just take a moment and cry a little because you are screwed. I am a daily smoker if you were curious!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me maybe will work for you 50/50 shot</li>
    <li> Not sure if this was solely the reasons why I passed as I incorporated other methods into detoxing my hair. I&#x27;m an infrequent user probably having smoked about 10-15 times in a 90 day window. I split the treatments up over 2 days, the day before my test and the day of. I also used the macujo method as well so I wouldn&#x27;t solely rely on this as the only way to pass. Best of luck to you guys.</li>
    <li> It sucks don&#x27;t use this if you have to pass s test followed instructions both times I did it two different times failed miserably both times left it in longer then it says had been two months clean and still failed don&#x27;t recommend this product at all waste of money</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me I don&#x27;t want to discourage anyone some people have good results it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Stopped 3 weeks before my hair test. Doubled up the amount of time of the shampoo. Got the job a month later!!! Hair&#x27;s not happy, but I got the job, so who cares! :)</li>
    <li> All I can say is this stuff is amazing. It works!  Im sure my OCD way of using it exactly by the directions to a T payed off greatly, point is though if you use it right it works. I got up at 5am and went through the whole process, at 2pm I took my test and came back toxin free, I was afraid to wait any longer because alot of different websights tell you something different about the length of time it works for.  Also the zydot websight has helpful hints that make sense. Hope this helps somebody!</li>
    <li> Product was used twice before the test and did not work. Still had traces of chemical in hair follicles so didn&#x27;t get the job. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Used 2 boxes, it didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m black. Smoked crazy amounts. Even cut my hair so they didn&#x27;t catch everything I ever did. Still positive for Mary Jane.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me and I haven&#x27;t done anything since February and even then it was not often just like once or twice a month.  I was hoping it would work.  Honestly, you cannot cheat a hair test.  If you know you may get a test just stay away from drugs.  Unfortunately is the way the system works when they should be honestly more concerned about alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, don&#x27;t waste your money and put false hopes!</li>
    <li> did not work, do not do it, lost a good opportunity for an excellent job.</li>
    <li> it did not work.  if you&#x27;re a daily opiate user and want to pass dont use this..... just sayin</li>
    <li> We have used it twice  along with another hair cleaning recipe, removed THC but not prescription medications.  Did lower the level though...  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money or time.  This will not work.  I followed the instructions to the tee.</li>
    <li> Works. I have very long thick hair, thought I should&#x27;ve bought 2 but turns out I didn&#x27;t need to. Think this is for someone that doesn&#x27;t burn one everyday. I am prescribed adderall and take it everyday for about a year. It didn&#x27;t even find a trace of it. Great product. Great price. I got the job!</li>
    <li> got this for neighbor and it didn&#x27;t work! now he is sitting in prison for a dirty test.</li>
    <li> Terrible product please dont ever buy it. All the reviews are a scam. Please dont waste your money or time with this product.This product does not even deserve a rating.</li>
    <li> Not worth crap! Total fraud!!  DOES NOT WORK!!</li>
    <li> The zydot shampoo worked very well for me. I have long dark hair about 20 inches. I used two of the shampoo treatments one after the other along with a clean shirt and towel. All together the treatments took about 3 hours, but I immediately went to get my hair tested after I was done and ended up testing clean.</li>
    <li> I used this the macujo method bleached my hair and died it twice. I passed. I don&#x27;t know if it was partly because of this but either way I&#x27;m glad I bought and did everything I did</li>
    <li> It worked great for me and my husband. I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Garbage, we just lost out on an opportunity of a lifetime. Drugs suck and not worth it ever..</li>
    <li> A weekend Camping with old friends could have derailed the prospect of a promotion. Thanks Zydot for saving my Quister!</li>
    <li> This s*** doesn&#x27;t work at all. My hair is short like a man&#x27;s I didn&#x27;t smoke in ages and followed the directions to a T. Did not work. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and passed my follicle  test I recommend it to anyone that stop smoking about30 to 45 days ago you will come up clean just stop smoking</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome stuff. Works great. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I used this product after several weeks of scrubbing my hair with vinegar, salicylic acid, and laundry soap. I also bleached my whole head bright blonde and then dyed it back to normal. The day of the test I used the product as directed to a tee. Passed the test no problem.</li>
    <li> Piece of s*** doesnt work</li>
    <li> Did 2 applications in 12 hours on long, dark, thick hair. Followed directions to the letter, took test 2 hours after 2nd application, and tested clean. Hair was a little worse for wear for about a week, but two deep conditioner treatments brought it back just fine. Recommended to anyone who needs a personal use detox hair product.</li>
    <li> It works !!!! I applied it 3 hours before I took the test and passed. Also tried the macujo method every day 3 days before. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Bulls***, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Sucks! Totally didn&#x27;t work! Will never use again</li>
    <li> Worked for me but I am a light user, detoxed/refrained for a month, and used this in conjunction with the Mancujo Method the morning of my test. The combination worked because I got the job!</li>
    <li> It worked for me, got the job</li>
    <li> I just got the results back from my hair follicle test,I stopped smoking two months before the test and still,I didn&#x27;t pass, this it&#x27;s a sad day for me, off coarse I&#x27;ll keep on trying to get that job that will pay the bills, this on payed twenty dollars an hour. I have a medical marijuana card, but that still doesn&#x27;t matter when it comes to them giving you a job, seems like discrimination to me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work at all.  Hubby has short hair we used this for 3 days in a row while also using other methods to &amp;#34;cleanse&amp;#34; his hair.  He tested negative.  So sorry if you believe all the positive reviews. They are lies don&#x27;t waste money</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help at all..... I failed my test and lost a good job.....</li>
    <li> Worked for me!!! I passed, used only a month before it seemed to work</li>
    <li> Failed. S***ty. Simple.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m gonna have to give it a thumbs up.. Just remember guys you can&#x27;t rely on this alone. Bleaching the hair is the most effective way to open the cuticle and penetrate the cortex! Does other methods along with zydot on the day of test, you can do it! I did it and I passed. I&#x27;m from Ohio and I dont work for the company! Just a FYI! Good luck guys!</li>
    <li> I ordered about 5 boxs, because face it the price is unbeatable, why not have a extra one for if the time ever comes again. So my husband quits is job to go to a different company, the new company tell him he would have to do a hair drug test. So we start to worry,  he&#x27;s not an everyday user more like once in a blue moon, just so happen he done a little bit of cocaine and took a few puffs off of marijuana within this three month timeframe that they can test back, well today about a week after the test he got a call telling him come to work he passed!  I recommend this product to anyone  Who hasn&#x27;t done heavy use of drugs. If you use heavily  I really couldn&#x27;t say how the product works for the ones of you said that you failed . Also it&#x27;s important to use the product directly as said nope  cutbacks.  We going to treatment the night before and one in the morning right before the test</li>
    <li> I passed using this product first then wait 15 minutes and complete using test pass dtex shampoo. Following directions to the tee.</li>
    <li> Passed with no problem..</li>
    <li> tamn s*** dont work i used it and failed my test its not worth the money or the near hour it took to use it it is a huge waste of time and money</li>
    <li> The product worked great! My hair is short though. I&#x27;d definitely recommend for men with shorter hair.</li>
    <li> This product works! I passed my test with flying colors! :)</li>
    <li> It did not work horrobil product i hope yall do somethinv to make it right it was a wast of money</li>
    <li> Have used this several times it works but you need 4 or 5 boxes .I  bleach and dye my hair 2 times 3 if my head is not to sore and I have enough time I use this 3 times one time after I bleach before I dye it back.the other 2 times after I mix baking soda and warm water into a paste and apply it on my hair let sit for 30 minutes. wash out then use.The last time I use 2 boxes a the day of my hair test.My hair is short about 2 to 3 inches brown. I know people who on the last day also use toxin wash shampoo instead of or with this.I had smoked about an 1/8 by myself over about 4 days 20 days prior I Hope This Helps</li>
    <li> Doing the vinegar, detergent regimine twice,  plus this I know for a fact works. . It worked for me.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what I needed it to do. Don&#x27;t be dumb and expect this to be the only thing you need to use in order to pass. Thing along with various other methods helped me pass.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Helped me pass my drug hair test when I had an amazing opportunity before me. Smoked 2 months before and had taken adderall w/o perscription.</li>
