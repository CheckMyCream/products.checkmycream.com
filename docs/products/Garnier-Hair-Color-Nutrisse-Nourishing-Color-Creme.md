      <li>Great color, arrived quickly, Super happy!</li>
      <li>It came out so bright.  </li>
      <li>But this was way too bright.  </li>
      <li>I think that would be a gorgeous color and closer to what I achieve with my homemade concoction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think that would be a gorgeous color and closer to what I achieve with my homemade concoction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would have loved this if it didn&#x27;t turn my hair Paramore orange instead of the color that is on the box.</li>
      <li>I love this color!  </li>
      <li>This color is absolutely lovely!</li>
      <li>I love this color!</li>
      <li>but I still liked it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost a rose gold.</li>
      <li>To have a &amp;#34;fade shade&amp;#34; that&#x27;s as nice as my freshly-colored hair is</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re in the mood to rock BRIGHT red hair, Garnier Nutrisse #74 is a wonderful choice.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After some experimenting I discovered that this color alone would make my hair bright orange since my hair was already so light.</li>
      <li>This reminds me of the light auburn color I used, but better!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Just be sure to condition, condition, condition no matter what</li>
      <li>So I tried mixing it with a light brown and my hair turned out burgundy!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Just be sure to condition, condition, condition no matter what</li>
      <li>so 2 boxes are better for longer hair.</li>
      <li>Every time I wash my hair, it seems to lighten a bit more.</li>
      <li>fanTAStic!</li>
      <li>The color is more orange than I thought</li>
      <li>I mix the color, the developer and the hair mask altogether, and the results are amazing, a great condition and colour in the same box!</li>
      <li>BUT by the magic of chemistry and color palettes, I determined that if I dyed my hair with the darker (Light Natural Copper) and then dyed it with the Lightest Intense Copper, I ended up with the perfect shade of light copper that I was aiming for from the beginning.</li>
      <li>Faded a bit too easy, even with color protect.</li>
      <li>;  Before the day was over I put a light ash brown 10-minute touch-up dye over it.  </li>
      <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve struggled to find something to match Light Auburn.</li>
      <li>The product itself seems pretty good -- works, doesn&#x27;t trash hair too much.  </li>
      <li>I like vibrant, intense reds with more orange tones than purple; the kind of color that hovers between &amp;#34;Wow</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several shades of Garnier Nutrisse, and this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re 16 years old and want screaming phony looking red, this might be perfect for you.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic bright red and I&#x27;m so thankful to have stumbled upon it!</li>
      <li>I do like bright red hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s waaaay too bright, waaaay too red</li>
      <li>I found a blogger who uses red dyes to make the perfect strawberry blonde and decided to try it.</li>
      <li>I wanted BRIGHT red hair and that is exactly what I got.</li>
      <li>I bought this on a lark after seeing the positive reviews and because, well, it was cheap.  </li>
      <li>I love this color - it&#x27;s a true red - and with my natural color being on medium-to-light scale, it gives me a nice copper color.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;fade shade&amp;#34; is a really nice orangey-strawberry blonde, too.</li>
      <li>Possibly it might have turned into a nice color after 2 weeks of washing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a natural light strawberry blonde with fair skin and freckles.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I waited 30 years to have fun with my hair.</li>
      <li>Normally I dye my hair a light or bright auburn, so this is considerably lighter/brighter than what I normally use.</li>
      <li>a much more natural look on my hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic shade that is bold but still natural.</li>
      <li>but usually I just let my copper flag fly.</li>
      <li>Definitely use this if you&#x27;re looking for a bright (but still natural) ginger shade.</li>
      <li>I just wish there was a color between this one and the Light Natural Copper.</li>
      <li>I really like the way it looks!</li>
      <li>I ran to the store again and bought this color along with the Light Natural Copper version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Conditioned my hair and left it really healthy.</li>
      <li>I just wish there was a color between this one and the Light Natural Copper.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d purchase at a store, exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I used a strawberry blonde dye first (another brand, admittedly), then used this over the top.</li>
      <li>so I was a little worried at first, but I got so many compliments - even from my cousin who&#x27;s a hairdresser!</li>
      <li>I have been dying my hair red for years and this really did give me very bright shiny hair as shown on the box even though previous red-hair dyes were much darker.</li>
      <li>It is extremely intense and pretty, without being unnatural.  </li>
      <li>What really impresses me about this color is that it stays vibrant and bright for a long time, which is rare for a red.  </li>
      <li>Everyone loved the color, however it didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
      <li>Like maybe a Light Red Copper.</li>
      <li>but this Lightest Intense Copper is a staple in my chemistry kit and color palette.</li>
      <li>I really like this color.</li>
      <li>This review is for Garnier Nutrisse Lightest Intense Copper.  </li>
      <li>Like maybe a Light Red Copper.</li>
      <li>, when I use this Lightest Intense Copper mixed with some Dark Strawberry Blonde (another brand) on my hair it comes out looking natural and the perfect amount of &amp;#34;woah&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I use the 643 Light Natural Copper as my root color to give it a more subtle look and like the results.</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t been this excited about hair color in a long time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m was hoping to try adding a bit of color, having normally been going with medium</li>
      <li>Their new magnetic line is</li>
      <li>Brand New Item, Arrives in Box</li>
      <li>Also, doing the root touch-up treatment gave me a &amp;#34;skull cap&amp;#34; look of this obnoxious color, and the 5 minutes on the rest of the length didn&#x27;t yield a match for the dyed new growth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to L&#x27;Oreal light auburn next time --</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been going back and forth between reds for about two years now since my favorite Feria red was discontinued at Sally&#x27;s (RIP All Out Copper Red).  </li>
      <li>The Light Natural Copper would make my hair too dark.</li>
      <li>My hair was the same vibrant orange-red from the box!</li>
      <li>Over the last few weeks, the color&#x27;s gone from a vibrant light copper auburn to a lovely dark strawberry blonde.</li>
      <li>If you want your color to look natural, stay away from this.  </li>
      <li>Because I have a pixie cut I need to dye my regrowth frequently</li>
      <li>know that reds are tricky depending on what you already have in your hair - naturally or otherwise.  </li>
      <li>your natural color is gorgeous!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Surely</li>
      <li>This looks to be the closest to my natural color.</li>
      <li>I love my hair now and use semi-permanent colors mixed with 10 vol and heavy conditioner to darken it slightly as it fades between full head applications of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will do this color and throw on a ultra light ash blonde with some 10 vol for about 5-10 minutes to tone it down</li>
      <li>The color is not nearly as &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; as pictured but that may be due to the fact I have been many different shades of reds for a couple of years.  </li>
      <li>Very orange, didn&#x27;t last long... but looked decent while it did last.</li>
      <li>I usually dye my hair a gold blonde with this line from my natural light ash blonde.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m a natural redhead an always mix with blonde to avoid a color that makes me look like a Buick.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised that it actually lightened my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve toyed with the thought of going red for a while, but I&#x27;m worried how professional it would look.</li>
      <li>Scared that I was going to mess up my first attempt at at-home dying, I read a million blogs/articles about dying hair red.</li>
      <li>I am naturally a redhead, but dye to cover grey.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The color is more orange than I thought but I still liked it. Conditioned my hair and left it really healthy.</li>
    <li> This color is absolutely lovely! I just wish they&#x27;d bring it back to the stores..</li>
    <li> Very orange, didn&#x27;t last long... but looked decent while it did last.</li>
    <li> Frighteningly red--and I&#x27;m a natural redhead an always mix with blonde to avoid a color that makes me look like a Buick.  Conditioning excellent.</li>
    <li> Perfect shade of orange! Everyone loved the color, however it didn&#x27;t last too long. Faded a bit too easy, even with color protect.</li>
    <li> I lightened my hair to medium blonde beforehand.  Then used this mixed with Loreal Excellence 7R (which I&#x27;ve used previously and came out a natural shade of red). OMG!!  It came out so bright.  I looked sort of like a punkish cartoon character.  Shocking orange.  I do like bright red hair but this was too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shampooed 7 times over 2 days but ended up having to dye over it.  Possibly it might have turned into a nice color after 2 weeks of washing but I couldn&#x27;t go to work with that color.  Would have been too embarrassing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair red for about 15 years now.  I tend to settle on a color I like and will usually only migrate to another after my fave gets discontinued.  I&#x27;ve been going back and forth between reds for about two years now since my favorite Feria red was discontinued at Sally&#x27;s (RIP All Out Copper Red).  I bought this on a lark after seeing the positive reviews and because, well, it was cheap.  Let me say it is PERFECT.  I&#x27;m a natural light strawberry blonde with fair skin and freckles.  I like vibrant, intense reds with more orange tones than purple; the kind of color that hovers between &amp;#34;Wow your natural color is gorgeous!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Surely that color can&#x27;t be real.&amp;#34;  What really impresses me about this color is that it stays vibrant and bright for a long time, which is rare for a red.  Because I have a pixie cut I need to dye my regrowth frequently so I usually do it once a month and the color doesn&#x27;t fade hardly at all.  This is a fantastic bright red and I&#x27;m so thankful to have stumbled upon it!</li>
    <li> I usually dye my hair a gold blonde with this line from my natural light ash blonde. I&#x27;ve toyed with the thought of going red for a while, but I&#x27;m worried how professional it would look. I found a blogger who uses red dyes to make the perfect strawberry blonde and decided to try it. Target was out of the brand the blogger used, so I fell back to Garnier Nutrisse, my usual &amp;#34;blonde-ing&amp;#34; brand. Their new magnetic line is fanTAStic! I used a strawberry blonde dye first (another brand, admittedly), then used this over the top. My hair was the same vibrant orange-red from the box! It was a big change so I was a little worried at first, but I got so many compliments - even from my cousin who&#x27;s a hairdresser! It&#x27;s a fantastic shade that is bold but still natural. The &amp;#34;fade shade&amp;#34; is a really nice orangey-strawberry blonde, too. It&#x27;s almost a rose gold. I really like the way it looks! Looks like I&#x27;ll be turning to this color instead of my usual gold blonde from now on!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re in the mood to rock BRIGHT red hair, Garnier Nutrisse #74 is a wonderful choice.  PBA this color is NOT for the faint-hearted.  I wanted BRIGHT red hair and that is exactly what I got.</li>
    <li> I love this color! Normally I dye my hair a light or bright auburn, so this is considerably lighter/brighter than what I normally use. But it looks great and dyed wonderfully on my medium brown hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this color. I decided to &amp;#34;go red&amp;#34; after a lifetime of being blonde. Scared that I was going to mess up my first attempt at at-home dying, I read a million blogs/articles about dying hair red. I tested and tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the day I decided to dye my hair I had my preferred color in hand. I did a strand test. Oops, it was going to be wayyy too dark. I ran to the store and bought a lighter version. Again, it was going to be too dark. I ran to the store again and bought this color along with the Light Natural Copper version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some experimenting I discovered that this color alone would make my hair bright orange since my hair was already so light. The Light Natural Copper would make my hair too dark. BUT by the magic of chemistry and color palettes, I determined that if I dyed my hair with the darker (Light Natural Copper) and then dyed it with the Lightest Intense Copper, I ended up with the perfect shade of light copper that I was aiming for from the beginning. I love my hair now and use semi-permanent colors mixed with 10 vol and heavy conditioner to darken it slightly as it fades between full head applications of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, when I use this Lightest Intense Copper mixed with some Dark Strawberry Blonde (another brand) on my hair it comes out looking natural and the perfect amount of &amp;#34;woah&amp;#34; copper without doing the two step process. Sometimes if I&#x27;m feeling a little less showy I will do this color and throw on a ultra light ash blonde with some 10 vol for about 5-10 minutes to tone it down but usually I just let my copper flag fly. I get compliments all the time and people can&#x27;t believe I dye my hair myself. I feel like a chemist in my bathroom and I am always trying out slightly different shades but this Lightest Intense Copper is a staple in my chemistry kit and color palette. I don&#x27;t know why I waited 30 years to have fun with my hair. So silly of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dye leaves hair feeling soft and not nearly as damaged as the horror stories I&#x27;ve read about on some of the other products that I almost used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to condition, condition, condition no matter what when you &amp;#34;go red&amp;#34;. I just wish there was a color between this one and the Light Natural Copper. Like maybe a Light Red Copper. I think that would be a gorgeous color and closer to what I achieve with my homemade concoction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, thumbs up for this line and hopefully they don&#x27;t discontinue it anytime soon.and not nearly as damaged as the horror stories I&#x27;ve read about on some of the other products that I almost used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to condition, condition, condition no matter what when you &amp;#34;go red&amp;#34;.

    <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find slightly reddish blond.  I&#x27;m was hoping to try adding a bit of color, having normally been going with medium blonde.&lt;br /&gt;I know that reds are tricky depending on what you already have in your hair - naturally or otherwise.  But this was way too bright.  So I tried mixing it with a light brown and my hair turned out burgundy!  Lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;In general, I like Garnier products and find them less harsh on the hair than L&#x27;Oreal or other brands.</li>
    <li> I would have loved this if it didn&#x27;t turn my hair Paramore orange instead of the color that is on the box.</li>
    <li> Good quality, worked perfect for me</li>
    <li> Great color, arrived quickly, Super happy!</li>
    <li> BIG MISTAKE! This review is for Garnier Nutrisse Lightest Intense Copper.  The product itself seems pretty good -- works, doesn&#x27;t trash hair too much.  But this color is a nightmare.  It&#x27;s waaaay too bright, waaaay too red (I&#x27;ve used diy hair dye for decades).  It screams &amp;#34;Look at me!  I&#x27;m an idiot when it comes to hair color!&amp;#34;  Before the day was over I put a light ash brown 10-minute touch-up dye over it.  Also, doing the root touch-up treatment gave me a &amp;#34;skull cap&amp;#34; look of this obnoxious color, and the 5 minutes on the rest of the length didn&#x27;t yield a match for the dyed new growth.  I&#x27;m going back to L&#x27;Oreal light auburn next time -- a much more natural look on my hair.  If you&#x27;re 16 years old and want screaming phony looking red, this might be perfect for you.  If you want your color to look natural, stay away from this.  HATE it!</li>
    <li> I love this color!  The color is not nearly as &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; as pictured but that may be due to the fact I have been many different shades of reds for a couple of years.  I use the 643 Light Natural Copper as my root color to give it a more subtle look and like the results.</li>
    <li> Hi! I have been dying my hair red for years and this really did give me very bright shiny hair as shown on the box even though previous red-hair dyes were much darker. My hair is below shoulder length so 2 boxes are better for longer hair. Garnier seems not to fade as fast as some of the cheaper products such as Revlon which I usually use. Will switch to Garnier from now on.</li>
    <li> This is my perfect color! I&#x27;ve used several shades of Garnier Nutrisse, and this one is by far the best. I used to use Garnier Nutrisse&#x27;s Light Auburn, which was sadly discontinued. Since then, I&#x27;ve struggled to find something to match Light Auburn. This reminds me of the light auburn color I used, but better! It is extremely intense and pretty, without being unnatural.  The color was also even from root to tip, which is difficult for me to achieve when I&#x27;m coloring my hair red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put &amp;#34;Lightest Copper&amp;#34; over dyed medium auburn hair and I was surprised that it actually lightened my hair. (Color isn&#x27;t supposed to lift color) Every time I wash my hair, it seems to lighten a bit more. Over the last few weeks, the color&#x27;s gone from a vibrant light copper auburn to a lovely dark strawberry blonde. To have a &amp;#34;fade shade&amp;#34; that&#x27;s as nice as my freshly-colored hair is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been this excited about hair color in a long time. Definitely use this if you&#x27;re looking for a bright (but still natural) ginger shade. Please keep this color, Garnier!</li>
    <li> Excellent value, love Subscribe and Save . Brand New Item, Arrives in Box You&#x27;d purchase at a store, exactly as described.I am coloring my hair today, and will update in a day or two. I am naturally a redhead, but dye to cover grey.This looks to be the closest to my natural color.</li>
    <li> I love this color - it&#x27;s a true red - and with my natural color being on medium-to-light scale, it gives me a nice copper color. I&#x27;m blue-eyed and freckled, and always felt my hair should be red - but it&#x27;s just a &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; dark blonde. This makes it the color I think it was supposed to be!</li>
    <li> This is easy to apply and covers my grays perfectly! Great value for money. I mix the color, the developer and the hair mask altogether, and the results are amazing, a great condition and colour in the same box!</li>
