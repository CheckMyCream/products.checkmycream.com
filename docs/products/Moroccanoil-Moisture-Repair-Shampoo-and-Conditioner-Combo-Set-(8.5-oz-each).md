<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair is in better conition than it has been in a very long time.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it smells really great.  My hairdresser introduced me to this product and my husband loves the smell.  It&#x27;s non greasy and does not leave a film in your hair and I get compliments on how good my hair looks.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my hair.  It supposed to do so. Plus the size is very small for the price.  Not buying his again!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have really dry hair because I dye it and this stuff makes it really soft and silky and it stays soft. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love it! It has done wonders for my hair and brought back the moisture lost:) I would recommend this to anyone looking to moisturizer their hair!</li>
    <li> I love this line of hair products and the overall feel it gives your hair. The company was really quick on getting me items to me and I&#x27;m a forever customer.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel soft and smooth. It smells great and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
    <li> Great product - makes my hair soft and smooth, smells great too. I received the product as promised. My only complaint is the price, this is a very pricey product.</li>
    <li> My wife learned of this product from her hair stylist who uses it on all clients.  Very nice shampoo and conditioner; rotates with Wen products.</li>
    <li> My hair quality become better since I use this items.</li>
    <li> I forever love this stuff!!! Soothes even the driest of hair and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Love the smell but it&#x27;s hard to describe..leaves a fresh out-of-the-salon smell, you could say.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product line...best conditioner and shampoo ever! Just a small portion creates creamy lather, easy to rinse. Deep conditioning leaves hair shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> same as what I usually buy from my hair salon.  love this product - it&#x27;s got such an awesome aroma.  I also use the oil and it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
    <li> this has always been my favorite go to shampoo and conditioner.  Great for color treated and frizzy hair.  Works so well and keeps my thick color treated hair in great shape always</li>
    <li> I swear by these products. I absolutely love them. I use them as my regular shampoo but they&#x27;re so good that very little goes a long way. They leave my hair silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> Smells great and gentle on hair</li>
    <li> I love these hair care products and were able to find then at Amazon for a fraction of the salon price</li>
    <li> I have become OCD...I can&#x27;t stop twirling a strand of my hair. It feels like a childs hair and I am 66. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo and conditioner over the last month. My hair is fine and as I&#x27;ve gotten older, half as thick as it used to be.  I just love it. It smells good and my hair is ultra-manageable in humidity and dry air.  I have received more compliments on how my hair looks in one month than the previous 2 years because this seems to help my blow-dry last much longer and my hair has more lift.</li>
    <li> When I first tried out the shampoo I noticed the smell reminded me of a combination of cat litter and baby powder. The cheap smell really turned me off from using the product. I expected the smell of a fancy \\&quot;Moroccanoil\\&quot; brand name to have more of a subtle relaxing fragrance. However I still gave it a few tries before completely rejecting the shampoo. Like all shampoos, the first couple of times of using a new shampoo my hair felt softer and smoother, but it wasn&#x27;t anything more or less than the turnout of a local drug store-quality shampoo. The price paid for the item is definitely not worth spending.</li>
    <li> My hair looks healthier and feels better than it ever has since I have been using this product.  I just wish I could find it in stores.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo that is healthy for the hair, as it does not contain harsh chemicals, and smells great too!!&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo produces good amount of lather which is not the case with shampoos that are good for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the shampoo, conditioner and mask at GBS beauty supply outlet.  I had used Agadir Argan Oil shampoo conditioner before and thought I give this brand a try.  No comparison, the Agadir product immediately made my hair feel silky and my blow out lasted several days.  This product felt like it left a strange residue on my hair that made it stiff and straw like.  I did a deep wash and condition to remove the product.  It took a few passes.  It may have some wax like ingredients in it.  Try Agadir products you&#x27;ll see a difference.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever for dry hair.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money, will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> This is the best product for dry hair, I was trying to find it for weeks and finally I bought it here because they have a really good price! I recommend you the product and the seller :)</li>
    <li> It smells soooooooo good!  My favorite shampoo and conditioner by far, even though it&#x27;s a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is simply amazing.  It revitalized my naturally curly hair.  It gave it tremendous body and even made styling easier.  It costs quite a bit more than I&#x27;d usually spend (I&#x27;m a ordinary, main stream brand kind of girl) but it is worth every penny. I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo for 3 weeks now, and really can tell a difference. My husband has commented on how much more body my hair has since using the shampoo/conditioner. I will be continuing to use all the products. I love the hair therapy mask, and the oil. All of the products smell really good, which to me is very important.</li>
    <li> For the cost of this shampoo and conditioner I expected a whole lot more. The shampoo isn&#x27;t any better then something I can buy at my local supermarket. The conditioner did not leave my hair as soft as even Sauve for $1.99. The bottles are so hard that it is hard to squeeze the product out onto your hand. The only good thing about this product is it smells good, that&#x27;s it. I do not reccommend this at all. Save your money.</li>
    <li> A stylist turned me on to Moroccan oil shampoo and I loved it. A bit pricey, but you only use a tiny amount and the results are well worth it. And I love the fragrance . . .</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT... the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very thick, coarse, highlighted blonde hair, and this is the only shampoo/conditioner that I feel really tames and smoothes it.  I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of the larger pump bottles of each product, and although I LOVED the smell initially, I&#x27;ve gotten so sick of it as it is very strong, overpowering, and smells of musk.  I alternate this with KMS California ColorVitality, though not nearly as good of a moisturizer, simply because I LOVE the smell of the KMS and get very sick of the MorrocanOil.  It&#x27;s a smell that definitely sticks on your hair all day, though, which I haven&#x27;t found in nearly any other product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo after a recommendation from my favorite youtube guru .. and she was right .. the Moroccanoil Moisture Repair shampoo &amp; conditioner are wonderful.  Only problem is the .. price.  It&#x27;s fairly expensive.</li>
    <li> I have friends who use this and love it. However, my hair and scalp did not like it at all. It makes my super straight hair insanely frizzy. The worst part is that it caused some sort of allergy on my scalp. My scalp is flaking, itching, and bleeding. I started using Selsun Blue to see if it will soothe it and sure hope it works before I need to see a dermatologist. I had high hopes for it. Waste of my money. :(</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed. Considering the cost of the  shampoo and conditioner, I expected a whole lot more. It is not a terrible product but my hair feels dry after each use. Also, it is very difficult to get the product out of the bottle. Tne  one redeeming quality is that it does smell good.  I cannot recommend this product at all. SAVE YOUR $$$$!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  I have very fine hair, color-treated that due to my age (53) has started to be dry and brittle.  I love this product - it smells great, leaves my hair soft and conditioned, but does not weigh it down.  I got these items in less than five days.  The only place I can find these products is in the highest-end salons and for much more.  Love it! If this sounds like you, don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever!!! My hair is thick and long and these one&#x27;s leave my hair so smooth, detangle and managable. You will feel your hair so soft and silky! I also used the moroccan oil and since that my hair have change and it is healthier</li>
    <li> I had heard much about these products and decided to test. My hair is much stronger and brighter ... recommend the use of the full range ...</li>
    <li> This product is nice, but the price says it should be special...but it is nice. Hair texture did not feel extra soft or extra conditioned</li>
    <li> I am in my late &#x27;30s and have always had thick, frizzy hair.  I love Moroccan oil and will continue to buy that, however their shampoo and conditioner are truly overpriced.  They smell fantastic but you get so little for what you pay and I found no difference in my hair texture.  In fact, I usually use Matrix Biolage and I will go back to that product because it does what it says and costs half as much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this company really needs to rethink its pricing strategy or they&#x27;ll find they just cannot compete in this market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through various phases of my hair care, from short, long, highlighted, natural, but most often limited heat damage.  I use a flat iron occasionally, don&#x27;t own a blow dryer, and let my hair dry naturally.  I have medium thick naturally dark brown.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and am very sensitive to smell (new Pantene is just too strong).  With that said, I have tried the Pureology Hydrate shampoo and conditioner, the S-Factor color savvy shampoo and conditioner, as well as the MoroccanOil Shampoo and Conditioner.  Here is my result of these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The s-factor products are the more inexpensive of the 3 sulfate-free options I&#x27;ve tried.  They smell very fun and fruity, kind of like grape candy or skittles.  The shampoo has good lather, and my hair felt de-tangled without needing a de-tangler when brushing wet.  I feel of the three, however, these were the least hydrating, as after using for a few months, my hair did not feel as soft as when I had switched to using the s-factor product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for me, it&#x27;s a toss up between the Pureology hydrate and the MoroccanOil brand shampoo and conditioner sets.  Since I live in Hawaii, previously lived in Oregon, the smell of the MoroccanOil seems more beachy, a little more like suntan lotion&#x27;s fragrance, however, I also love the lavender/orange sent of the Pureology as well.  It is very earthy and natural, and the minty smell and refreshing minty feel of the of the Pureology Conditioner is also very nice on the scalp, which is a feeling lacking with the MoroccanOil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I don&#x27;t think there is too much difference in the shampoos other than the preference of fragrance and price, but to rank the conditioners as most conditioning to least conditioning: MorroccanOil, Purology Hydrate, S-Factor Color Savvy.  If you are more interested in a sulfate free product for the environmental reasons, perhaps lean more towards the Pureology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps -</li>
    <li> I used this product for a while but have found something else that provides me what my hair truly needs.</li>
    <li> It is too thick to come out of the bottle. I ended up throwing it away. It got hard and thick. Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair when I voiced my concern that my hair was dry.  After one use of the shampoo and the conditioner, I noticed improvements with my hair texture (shiny/silky).  The shiny/silkiness lasted until my next shampoo.  I was so impressed that I had to purchase for home use. I plan to purchase the Moroccan Oil next.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that smells wonderful.  I have thick wavy hair though, and sometimes the conditioner alone does not get my tangles out.  I have to use an additional conditioner.  I still love the product.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my daughter -- she LOVED it.</li>
    <li> Wife given the product and liked so much she bought some for herself and the person who gave it to her.</li>
    <li> Oh man! I love how it feels but the scent is too strong. I don&#x27;t want to smell my own hair all day. And using the shampoo WITH the conditioner makes it worse.</li>
    <li> works really well. Leaves little residue. Bottle is on on the smaller end. I wanted something wi th a few more ounces.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is nice. It lathers well but rinses easily and the hair is soft. However, the conditioner hardened like cement on my hair. It&#x27;s supposed to be moisturizing. I combed through and my hair shed profusely. My hair was hard to detangle and style afterward. I decided to give it a second chance and used it on my next wash. It was worse. I decided never again. I had to buy the restorative mask with orange lid to bring back my hair. My hair is chemically treated (relaxed and highlighted) but it is very healthy. I have minimal breakage and it is mid back length. I would recommend the conditioner with the mask. Do not buy the conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> I was referred to Morrocan oil about a year ago after I did a keratin treatment...went searching for the oil but got argan oil (not the moroccan brand) it did the job..but the smell was...nothing special...and now I found out about the shampoo &amp; conditioner and even though Im overdue for another keratin treatment..I used it today instead of my regular shampoo,cant say the texture of my hair is any different but Im more excited to use it afterrr my keratin to see how long I can stretch out my treatment.But the smell is just wonderful!</li>
    <li> I fell into the hype about this particular line and then bought the products. I don&#x27;t like any of them (shampoo, conditioner, deep hydrating mask) at all. All 3 smell wonderful, but that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s a plus for them. The shampoo really dries out my hair and even leaving the coditioner on for 5 minutes (it recommend 1-2), upon rinsing my hair feels it feels like straw. I don&#x27;t even have medium to severly damaged hair! The mask isn&#x27;t as bad as the shampoo and conditioner, but for the $35 price tag, it&#x27;s not worth it. I prfer many drugstore brands over this line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these products before.  Love the whole line.</li>
    <li> Pleased with product and delivery time.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a month, returned the salon for a cut/color.  My stylist of 6 years actually said: your hair is so soft, what are you using?  Product is thick, takes only a little bit.  I have thick, wavy hair, this would probably not work as well on thin hair.  Great smell too. Used to use Kerastase, now I am a convert.</li>
    <li> My hair was broken and dry, since I&#x27;m using this product looks more healthy, soft and shiny. The best thing is that my hair  looks hydrated but not greasy.</li>
    <li> Bought these in preparation for arrival home back from Afghanistan.  It arrived in plenty of time so I didn&#x27;t have to shop soon after my return home.  Good value too.</li>
    <li> Well I always buy this product for my girlfriend and she really love it so much so I guess it is worth the money it does cost. What I can tell is that the outcome is really good....her hair are really nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> Have been using both the shampoo and conditioner daily for a little over a year, and they leave my hair clean and manageable.  I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Although a bit pricey for the size, these products are good.  You feel the difference in your hair.  Not as dry and brassy as even products such as Paul Mitchell Supercharged conditioner and other sulfate free shampoos.  Will recommend if you have some extra cash and you want a healthy head of hair.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an avid Moroccan \\&quot;oil\\&quot; user. I love it sooo much that I decided to try the Shampoo and Conditioner.  Well.  I do not like it at all.  The \\&quot;only\\&quot; good thing about it is, your hair will smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to the Oil.</li>
    <li> Just love these products. Hair feels softer and looks so much better. During a Georgia summer my hair has stayed looking good.</li>
    <li> I started using MoroccanOil shampoo and conditioner over a year ago.  For both of them, a bottle lasted me 6 months, so though expensive I think it&#x27;s worth the price.  My hair is so much stronger and healthier, even though I have it colored at the salon every 3 months.  These products are the best.  I also use the MoroccanOil for curly hair - keeps the curls in without making my hair brittle.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this product because I heard so many great things about it.  I&#x27;ve bought so many hair products before and I never get the results that are promised, but this product really worked for my damaged hair.  It made my hair feel so silky soft and healthy. It is a little pricey, but worth every penny. I would definitely recommend this hair product.</li>
    <li> Love the product...but it is not feasible to continue purchasing this in the size bottles it comes in. Not worth the price at all.</li>
    <li> my naturally curly hair is fine but i have lots of it (according to my stylist anyway) she recommeneded this product becuase she swears by the oil so i figured this was the same brand so it must be good. I was an avid dove user because it was the only conditioner that was not runny and would leave my hair soft and untangled.&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo after i rinsed, left my hair feeling like straw very dry and like it would break apart if i even attempeted to run my fingers thorugh it.&lt;br /&gt;i put the conditioner on and honestly was not at all impressed. i normally put conditioner on and then comb my hair (in the shower) let it sit for a bit then i rinse.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t even get the comb thorugh and after about 5 minutes i had tons of hair in my hands and it was actually painful to untangle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;yeahthe smell is great but if i keep using this i&#x27;m going to have no hair left to have to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried bumble and bumble (not as bad but still not the conditioning i am looking for) and i am now waiting to get my quidad order, but honestly i&#x27;m back to my good old trusty dove for the meantime until.&lt;br /&gt;for the price i expected more , not a miracle but definitely not straw hair.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this on my hair and my hair smelled great.  What I received was stinky and my hair has been horrible all day!  Don&#x27;t purchase online.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this combo!!  My hair is smooth and silky and not weighed down.  I have very fine hair so was skeptical, but not to worry, it&#x27;s all good!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Experience . Exactly what want.</li>
    <li> I always had difficulty &amp;#34;getting my hair to behave.&amp;#34; I had dry, poofy, uncontrollable hair. I used this product (the shampoo and conditioner) and immediately found my hair to be absolutely beautiful. It was soft, silky, manageable, and fell straight and flat. Not to mention, I don&#x27;t think any shampoo, conditioner (or ANY other personal hygiene products) smell as absolutely incredible as this stuff does. If you want the excellentest hair ever, you need Moroccanoil.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very dry and tangled. Does not seem like the legit product</li>
    <li> This is not the real stuff. Beware. It smells similar but the shampoo does not lather correctly and the conditioner does not result in the smoothness that I&#x27;m used to with this product.  Definitely watered down or just plain fake.</li>
    <li> Best product ever! Love this shampoo. Best thing about Moroccanoil ias that all the product smell the same so you are not stuck with competing fragrances!</li>
    <li> Product came rather quickly...a bit disappointed  I paid so much($35+) for the 8.5oz bottles but I love the product so I guess its worth it. I have been using the oil and curl cream for a few years and have no spoilt ends. My curls are great even without mousse our hair. The shampoo and conditioner are just icing on the cake. Smells good and feels good. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> Delivery was great on this item, only problem is the bottles were very sticky, some of the shampoo and conditioner came out of the bottle, should have been secured better than they were.&lt;br /&gt;I used this shampoo after I got out of the swimming pool this morning and it seemed to keep my shine.</li>
    <li> These products are very nice and conditioning to my color treated hair. When you use both products it does weight my thick hair down a bit though. So sometimes I only use the conditioner or just the shampoo. It smells wonderfull! People I don&#x27;t know have stopped me&lt;br /&gt;on the street to ask what I&#x27;m wearing that smells so good, well it&#x27;s this product... Everything they make is like heaven on your head!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, course, and dry hair.  This shampoo and conditioner works really well for me.  I have to watch my son becauses he uses it as well and often times I find it in his shower!  Great product.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser introduced me to this stuff and I love it so much!  It makes my hair so soft and it smells like a tropical vacation!  Love it!  I use it with the moroccanoil and the curl cream!</li>
    <li> WASN&#x27;T WHAT I EXPECTED WASN&#x27;T WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
    <li> I have very coarse hair and it leaves my hair soft and shiney.. It out does any other brand I have used.</li>
    <li> I have heard excellent things about moroccanoil products.I bought shampoo/conditioner combo, oil treatment light and oil intense hydrating mask.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin and highlighted blonde hair and and it gets greasy with most of products for thin hair. currently, using moroccanoil my hair looks healthy and smooth, and it does not weigh my hair down. I use daily. love the fragrance, love the products!</li>
    <li> I had been told this product was exellent but when I tried it my hair got so, but so tangled it took me about 45 minutes to untangle with different conditioners because their conditioners didn&#x27;t work at all.  The worst part is that I lost so much hair trying to untagle it I was worried and desperate.  It did not work for me at all but I gave it to my sister to try and she said it left her hair super soft.  I&#x27;ll try it a second time.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great for dry hair.</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo &amp; Conditioner Combo Set (8.5 oz. wife loved it would use and buy again good value</li>
    <li> I thought I checked the reviews before I purchased this product but was obviously mistaken.  THIS WAS NOT MOROCCANOIL product.</li>
    <li> There was something in these that my scalp was horribly allergic to.</li>
    <li> After using for a week my curls were gone, no body left...stopped using.</li>
    <li> I was sent the clarifying shampoo instead of the moisture repair that I ordered. I didn&#x27;t realize it until the second day of shampooing.</li>
    <li> Wow! The moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner works wonders for your hair!! It sure did for mine and not to mention I got the product fast!! I will def purchase again from this seller!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t read all the reviews but very definitely disagree with the one star review. First, it is a fact the product lasts a long time. Perhaps I am more careful about the amount I use because of the price. It leaves my hair without static electricity. In other words I have a little more control over my wildly curly hair. The scent is amazing compared to every product I have used in the past, and at my age that is quite a few products.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am an avid morrocanoil user. The oil is magnificent, I use it in the morning before I shower, after I shower, even before bed. Love it. NOT THE SHAMPOO. The shampoo is as drying as rubbing alcohol. Save yourself the money and put rubbing alcohol on your head. AWFUL shampoo. I have long thick highlighted hair, I can&#x27;t have a product that causes more breakage...this does.Hair is so brittle and dry after shampooing that I was scared to try and run my fingers through it. The smell is nice, that&#x27;s it. I also bought the conditioner as well, it was ok, but it was also pretty drying. I used the morrocaoil shampoo twice then got fed up with it and gave it to my boyfriend...he even said it was drying! We trashed it. Stuff is so awful.Stick to the oil, it&#x27;s the best product in the world.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, but this last time when I ordered it. It was open and leaked all over the place. Usually they are taped shut but not this time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was recommended because of the moisture it is supposed to provide for naturally curly hair.  I bought the set and I knew after rinsing the shampoo out that this product was not going to work for my hair.  I used it in the shower and the shampoo is just not rich enough to provide moisture from the scalp to the ends.  I felt like I was using the cheap shampoo that you find in most hotel rooms.  I rinsed the shampoo out and followed with the conditioner.  I could already tell it was not going to work just by the texture of the conditioner, it wasn&#x27;t creamy enough and I had to use almost the whole bottle to feel like my hair was completely moisturized (my hair is shoulder length).  I never rinse the conditioner all the way out and I use cold water to rinse and close the cuticle of my hair and my hair just didn&#x27;t feel the same as it does when I used my other shampoos/conditioners.  I&#x27;m going to either go back to my old shampoo and conditioner or try something new because this product is not it and the price is ridiculous.  I will use the rest of this shampoo and conditioner and never buy again. I ordered some other Moroccan Oil products hopefully they will work out better.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the oil and a keratin product on my hair.  I love the smell of it and it works great on my hair.  I highly recommend if you have dry hair and get split ends easliy.</li>
    <li> I love Moroccanoil. I switched a few months ago and will never go back, it has made my hair seem so much healthier, shinier and less frizzy. I dye my hair regularly and felt like it was drying out - this shampoo and conditioner has been a miracle worker. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This product is great! My fianc&amp;eacute; doesn&#x27;t let me use it, but she said it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> This stuff was not for me but for my mother.  She loves it, so I guess it deserves 5 stars!</li>
    <li> There is not a shred of doubt in my mind that the shampoo I received as a part of this order is not 100% MoroccanOil shampoo. The conditioner might be, but I&#x27;m doubtful because of the smell of the shampoo (which is markedly different from the MoroccanOil shampoo I bought from my hair salon). Don&#x27;t try to save yourself a few dollars by buying online - go to a salon and make sure you get the right product that you are paying for. Mine was bought from seller: NY Supply in case that&#x27;s at all helpful.</li>
    <li> I love moroccanoil oil products, it truly is the next best thing to going to the beauty salon.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My hair is in its best shape ever, at 60 years old</li>
    <li> Been using these a few years. Fantastic duo.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love,love, this product.  I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to nature hair and this product has really helped prevent breakage.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but i love this line of products. The shampoo smells tropical and clean, but the conditioner has the right thickness and texture that has finally helped put some life back into my color/perm damaged hair! Paired with the Moroccan oil left me waking up with hair I&#x27;ve always wanted. seriously awesome compared to other products that may smell/clean well (those cheaper creams you find at target/bed bath/beyond, etc) but this just adds real moisture and softness back in. yay!</li>
    <li> It was okay? The smell of the product did not match my moroccanoil oil I got already it was much stronger and kind of made me sick. Honestly the word minimum is dumb</li>
    <li> The item was advertised as new but the product has been opened and is not sealed as new. Some of the shampoo had been used. Was not full.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of moroccan products. I bought these just to see if I should invest in more of their products. Now, I will!</li>
    <li> I like the smell. But I don&#x27;t know that it is better and/or worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have stopped using all other types of hair products. My hair is soft, natural and easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;Use the oil as well which eliminates the need for moose, and heavy sprays.</li>
    <li> This set was recommended to me by a stylist when I asked for a shampoo and conditioner for highlighted hair that needed volume. I generally use Dove moisterizing shampoo and conditioner but I was willing to pay more for something that offered dramatic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product made my hair dry and tough to comb out, even with leaving the conditioner in for 2 minutes before rinsing. I even added the moisterizing cream for curls after I got out of the shower and it didn&#x27;t make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, it wasn&#x27;t worth the price. A cheaper shampoo worked better.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality</li>
    <li> the product is amazing it made my hair feel and smell saloon did. and its still holding its moister this is a must have and i highly recomend it</li>
    <li> I agree with reviewers who say the shampoo and conditioner both smell really great, and they do a good job on your hair, but they are overpriced. If you can find these at a price that fits your budget (and Amazon&#x27;s deal seems to be pretty good), I say go ahead and get it once. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily get this shampoo and conditioner set over and over again, though, 1) because it&#x27;s too pricey, and 2) because your hair might be used to the products and it&#x27;s good to change around to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me give you a little summary of how I use this shampoo and conditioner if it helps you understand how it can be effective for you. I wash my hair twice a week, and use this combo once a week. My hair is currently not dyed, totally natural, and I never use hair spray, gel, or leave-in conditioner. I also apply a quarter-sized amount of coconut oil after towel drying my hair. And I rarely comb or brush my hair. That&#x27;s all I do, and Moroccan Oil seems to work very well for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have hard to manage hair, but not my hair looks wonderful NATURALLY, and I finally get compliments on it! If the price isn&#x27;t too big of an issue I would recommend you get it once!</li>
    <li> ended up purchasing from a salon and the formula is much better. not sure if i got a bad batch or what</li>
    <li> Came in excellent packaging it works very well my hair is awsome i love it am ordering more soon thanks amazon</li>
    <li> I think this product was old. Made my hair snarly and left a film. I have bought this before and never had this problem.</li>
    <li> I purchased these items as a gift. The arrived promptly are were in good condition; the recipient was very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> great lather, nice smell. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really helping with my dry scalp, which is why I started using it, but it isn&#x27;t hurting and I always have lots of body, which I like a lot.  This is probably the first shampoo I will reorder - I tend to switch around and never found a &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; - until now.</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair product.  I live in a very dry environment and have curly hair so this offers moisture.  Only complaint, very expensive, small bottles.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give this less than one star. I paid good money for something that is completly false! How can they get away with lying Amazon?</li>
    <li> Very nice to the touch. Smell of product need to improve though not user friendly but great product for moisturized effect.</li>
    <li> This products really helped me with my hair.  I totallly recomendamos rhem!</li>
    <li> Dried my hair out, and left it frizzy and tangled.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  I thought I would get a better price on Amazon instead of the salon, and it was a little lower, but it is just an expensive product, but you can  be assured of one thing, it does exactly what it says, and the scent is wonderful.  I just love this, and buy the whole line of products.</li>
    <li> too small..........:(</li>
    <li> love it always, receive always early. thanks</li>
    <li> I have have been more than please these Moroccanoil products. I have also tried the Moroccanoil serum-Great combo with these! You will love your hair!</li>
    <li> I have used this before, and although it is pricey, this stuff really works wonders on my hair! I will be repurchasing for sure.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t receive the whole order shampoo missing sent it back and went to salon to purchase it for the same price and to make sure it was a true moroccanoil product.</li>
    <li> everything was great start to finish.  I love moroccanoil products.  It makes my hair feel great and it doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the product is worth the price.  I love the Moroccan oil, but don&#x27;t see a big difference in my hair with this product.  Smells good though!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very thick coarse hair and this shampoo and conditioner is the bomb for that kind of hair. A little pricey but worth it I think.</li>
    <li> Please do not waste your money on this product! It destroyed my hair! I have used it in combination with the oil and my hair felt like straw and lost its shine. It made my hair really crunchy too. I immediately returned it back to the salon and switched to Bed Head Urban Antidotes level 2 which saved my hair. The smell of the Morrocan Oil stinks like baby powder. I give it an F.</li>
    <li> One of the best for moisture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m certain that with the right hair type this might be a perfect fit, unfortunately this product has done some serious damage to my hair. I have long curly hair that is thick but my strands are fine. I tried using it for a month to see if there would be any changes in the texture and feel of my hair but there wasn&#x27;t a positive change. My hair became a frizzy mess. It&#x27;s unmanageable and now because a rats nest way too easily! It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> They both have a wonderful smell and the shampoo is fantastic for my hair. However the conditioner is no good for me, it turned my hair into a big mess that I can barely brush after.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed in the product. Didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was clean and for the cost not a lot of product.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t confirm, but i feel like i got a knockoff product.  My girlfriend also noticed that it did not work as well as the first bottle (which we bought at the store).  Shady feeling here</li>
    <li> Moroccan hair products are the best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos  over the years and found this particular product the best for my hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Even came earlier than expected!</li>
    <li> this commbo set from moroccan oil makes my hair feel and look super silky and smelling great. It is not cheap but the stuff is high quality and very professional. This set usually lasts me about 4-6 weeks before I need to by another.</li>
    <li> Super super super!!! All I can say is the best i ever had tried . My hair stop falling of!</li>
    <li> I heard so much about the products so I was excited to try the shampoo and conditioner. The \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; shampoo actually made my hair really dry. Since I spent so much money on this product, I will finish the bottle but don&#x27;t understand the hype</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything amazing to say about this and I don&#x27;t have anything terrible, I won&#x27;t buy it again.  It is just ok, doesn&#x27;t&#x27; leave my hair with any extra softness or shine just frizzy and clean; still have to use the Moroccan oil.  O</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! leaves your hair silky and beautiful. I have curly hair that is frizzy and hard to manage. Not anymore!</li>
    <li> My wife loves tis stuff. Will get again fo shore.</li>
    <li> My mom purchased a few Morroccanoil products for me several years ago and I was hooked.  I use some less expensive evironmentally friendly options as well in my hair care regime but these Repair products and the Morroccanoil Treatment are my favourites.  I&#x27;m so pleased with the results every time I use them-they&#x27;re also sulfate, phosphate and paraben free.</li>
    <li> This does not have the same effect on my hair as when I buy it from my hairdresser and it does not smell as nice.  Seems like it is watered down.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Love the smell, don&#x27;t know yet how much it will help my hair, not sure I like the feeling of my hair after I use it.</li>
    <li> Nothing else makes my hair feel soft and look shiny as Moroccan Oil.  There are other products that say they compare to Moroccan Oil, but save your money and buy the real thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for one wash so far, but I loved the results. My hair was soo silky smooth and smelled amazing! It made my hair a lot easier to manage during the styling process!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 3 years. Color lasts longer. Keeps my hair shiny and beautiful. Don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is too exquisite for my pocketbook, but it&#x27;s part of a beloved granddaughter&#x27;s eighth-grade graduation gift. I haven&#x27;t given it to her yet, but it&#x27;s what she wanted, so I&#x27;m sure she will be happy. She happens to have a gorgeous head of hair, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what these products do to enhance it.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this product until my aunt gave me hers but from the first use I was sold. Usually when I wash my own hair it gets tangled (couldn&#x27;t quite get it the way hairdressers do) but with Moroccanoil my hair was soft and tangle free. After seeing the difference in hair strength and health, once both bottles were finished I had to buy another set the first chance I got. I wasnt disappointed. The product was delivered on-time and both the shampoo and conditioner were as expected; same scent, quality and best of all, same great result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost a year of using this product my hair is completely transformed. Its longer, stronger and healthier than it has ever been! Would definitely order again and again.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and my long hair is easy to comb after conditioning. Good lather. 4 stars because I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> I really really really wanted to like this shampoo. I have medium-length, thick, wavy/coarse hair, and I was looking forward to finding something that would help make my hair more smooth. After a few weeks of using this shampoo and conditioner, my hair became lifeless, heavy, dull, and oily. Even after just washing it, my hair felt tangled and oily. Thankfully a clarifying shampoo helped remove the product buildup. I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s worked for so many people. I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I thought it was pricey, but my stylist recommend so I purchased on Amazon because it was the best deal I could find. Glad to find out it doesn&#x27;t take much to lather up and clean my hair.  It smells amazing and my damaged hair is looking and feeling better after a few shampoo/conditioning treatments.</li>
    <li> this product has always been my all time favorite, since I found it 5 years ago....,,my hair has sucked up the good stuff! and it feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> These products work great! However, the smell isn&#x27;t the best but does improve hair if damaged. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone that is looking to repair their hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Moroccanoil for several years now, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased from this vendor.  Every time I use it, it makes my hair frizzy.  It usually makes my hair very smooth and moist.  This can&#x27;t be authentic.  I want to return it, but missed the return date.  Very frustrating....</li>
    <li> This kit Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo &amp; Conditioner delivers a very good product quality for its price! Recommended if you are looking for this brand / price range.</li>
    <li> I like the way these products moisturize my hair, but it can get heavy if I use them every day. I alternate with my other shampoo and conditioner.  The price was right here compared to salons.</li>
    <li> It was disappointed. It made my hair very dry.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is helps my hair to keep smooth and shine. I have been using it for about one year now, and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> these are AWFUL!!!! stay away and don&#x27;t waste your money. shampoo from a pharmacy brand will de-tangle and add shine to my hair better than these two products...what a sham!</li>
    <li> Great value and leaves your hair so fresh that you can go a few days without washing and your hair still smells good and looks great.</li>
    <li> My hair looks great when I use this product. It just takes a very small amount, so a bottle lasts months.  My hair is very dry, and with the Moroccanoil products, my hair lays great.</li>
    <li> Like the product but not worth $35.00 for 8oz for both shampoo and conditioner. I went to using H*E*A*D which is just as good. Paid less got more.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife who has been bugging me about these for some time. I tell you, my wife smiles whenever she uses them. She tells me her hair smells better and shinier. Happy wife is...you know, keeps me at peace. :)</li>
    <li> This product is honestly a waste of money , $48 for 2 x 8oz bottles ! The shampoo seemed okay, but there was just something not right about the conditioner , it made my hair dry and frizzy . It didn&#x27;t work as they say it would . Very disappointed . Don&#x27;t buy this product , unless its from your salon , pay a little more money for the true legit product !</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  Makes your hair feel thick and healthy.  And the smell -- people actually come up to you and tell you how good you smell and when you have them smell your hair -- yep, that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re smelling!  My hair has never been healthier and never smelled so yummy!!!  These products are pricey and I hesitated, but not anymore, I just use it sparingly and it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> never mind other shampoos or conditioners, this is simply the best there is bar none, highly recommend it to all who still have hair</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft. Controls frizz and holds style well! Great addition to my other morrocan oil hair products .</li>
    <li> The repair shampoo works very well and repairs the split ends well.  The conditioner works well but is a bit heavier than preferred.</li>
    <li> Works great in my dry hair. The perfume scent is strong.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is my favorite,  it makes my hair soft as I&#x27;m washing it. The conditioner is okay but I&#x27;m more of a fan of the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American who allowed &#x27;beautians&#x27; who have no experience with long, non-purchased hair, to ruin my once long and healthy hair by using cheap products and lots of heat. My hair is again 2&amp;#34; past my bra strap (all mine - no weave or pieces). I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for about a year now.  Just I saw one of my old beauticians because I needed a trim (not one of the experts who contributed to my damaged hair).  She was shocked at how long and healthy my hair has become.  She also complimented me on how my hair not only looks and feels healthy, its also very strong.  This duo really does add moisture and repairs damaged hair. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> My hair never felt better this product mad my hair soft, bouncy and just beautiful without having to put greese in it....my hair never looked and felt this good without going to the hair dresser.....</li>
    <li> Have been using Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner for a couple of years. I am completely satisfied with the products and will continue using. Other products claiming to be as good for a little less money have not proven to be in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Purchased these products a while back. Wasn&#x27;t too impressed. A little on the heavy side and didn&#x27;t see much improvement, so discontinued use. Since I have a lot of fine hair, I&#x27;ve moved on to Light Argan Oil products. They&#x27;re great on skin and hair. If you have thick, corse hair this shampoo/conditioner set might work well for you.</li>
    <li> great price on an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair. I do not wash it every day. More like every other day or every 3 days. This product is the best I have found for my hair.  Usually I have to use a bunch of shampoo and conditioner but with this I do not. The shampoo foams really good and I am able to brush the tangles out of my hair easily with just a quarter size amount of conditioner.</li>
    <li> The one that My Wife was looking for. I have rcomended for lots of freineds and the loved it quite bit.</li>
    <li> smooth transaction, product as expected.</li>
    <li> This was not the right product for my curly and sometimes frizzy hair. I thought I needed the moisture repair when I should have stayed with the hydrating shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Never buy this product,made my hair dry,impossible  to brush and messy .really no star at all .just wasted  my money</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is awful! It&#x27;s strips your hair and dries it out... You would think it would do the opposite, but I can hardly get a brush through my hair, after using this product!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for dry processed hair.  I had some other moroccan oil products which made my hair limp or were not moisturizing enough.  The smell is luscious  and my hair is back in the condition it should be..</li>
    <li> I love this product.. It makes me hair feel so soft and manageable .it really makes combing  through my hair after shampooing easy.. I have very dry hair and this is amazing</li>
    <li> my wife loves it and swears by the product, her hair always looks amazing so i cant tell if it is the shampoo or not</li>
    <li> I really like them！！！many of my friends also use them. I always use them with Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment with Blue Box together， the smell is good， and the effect for my hair is pretty good！</li>
    <li> These products left my hair feeling very oily and dirty after the first day and then the product takes on a &amp;#34;not so good smell&amp;#34;.  These might be good with those with very dry hair since it does say &amp;#34;moisture repair&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are quite pricey, but worth the $$ spend. My hair feel soft and with volume.  I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccan oil , the actual oil, for over 10 years now.this was my first experience with the shampoo and conditioner and my hair is so soft and shiny I am hooked for life!</li>
    <li> I loved the product. I would recommend it. Has left my hair feeling wonderful and smells great. I will be getting some more product.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Works good on my thick hair. This stuff goes a long way and the conditioner works so much better than regular brands.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! Will def be ordering again. My hair has never been softer and easier to brush out. A+++++</li>
    <li> I really don’t like to go to saloon frequently because it really damage my hair of some of harmful chemical. Thanks there are now product like this Moroccannoil Moisture Repair, it really helps my hair not become dry and ugly.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time, (bought from salons). The consistency is different and it makes my hair dull and limp. I had to go out and replace it from a professional retailer. I feel they must mix it with cheap, generic shampoo and conditioner and sell it to us as a pure product. NEVER again. I&#x27;m going to get my money back.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this on my hair and always tries to sell me on it.  Generally I purchase whatever looks good at target.  Really, this didn&#x27;t improve my hair at all - in fact, its super messy when I wash with this stuff.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this brand but the price is way too high for the small bottles. The product itself is great but I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent so much on it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone unless they were very wealthy and could afford it.</li>
    <li> I had a question and contacted Moroccanoil directly. This is the reply from the company:&lt;br /&gt;Please be advised that stores or any website including www.amazon.com, are NOT authorized retailers of Moroccanoil and that Moroccanoil has not and will not sell any of its products to these companies and/or websites. Furthermore, we have reasons to believe the products currently available through these retailers are counterfeited. Consequently, we are in the process of taking strong legal actions, and we are hopeful this will soon stop these companies from offering these products that may jeopardize the health of consumers.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Product delivered.&amp;#34; It made my color treated hair shinny, silky and tangle free. Most conditioners weight my fine strait hair down. Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner was also great for my daughters natural spiral curly hair and my other daughter who has multiple texture hair.  This product is also gentle enough for my granddaughters hair.  I finally found a product that can work on all texture hair. Thank you. I don&#x27;t have to buy 4 different types of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Smelled nice. I have older, thinner hair and I still had some frizz after using this. I just used some of the regular Morccanoil after drying to calm it down and to add some shine.</li>
    <li> I expected much more from this company. I hope I like the hair treatment more. Not bad but, was hoping for more.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these products . They make my fine, thin, damaged hair silkier , smoother and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo and conditioner and have no clue what they put in there.  It literally makes your hair feel like it&#x27;s glue.  It&#x27;s horrendous and shame on them for ripping people off.  Karma is going to go back to them somehow.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo &amp; conditioner at the recommendation of my hair stylist &amp; it has not disappointed.  I saw an almost instant change as it has restored my hair back to its natural shine &amp; no more frizzies. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner. The smell is fantastic and my hair feels great after using it. It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Addicted to the fragrance. I get constantly complimented when I use it. It&#x27;s too heavy for my fine curly hair and seems to weigh it down.</li>
    <li> I like the product and I have been using it since I received it. I have already known how good the product was by word of mouth so there was not any unpleasant surprise about its quality.</li>
    <li> a dupla &amp;eacute; &amp;oacute;tima. o cheiro &amp;eacute; maravilhoso. quando combinado com o &amp;oacute;leo &amp;eacute; melhor ainda. a loja &amp;eacute; &amp;oacute;tima, tive um atraso de 1 semana na entrega, entrei em contato com a loja para saber o motivo e meus emails foram respondidos imediatamente.&lt;br /&gt;estou satisfeit&amp;iacute;ssima.</li>
    <li> i,ve been using this product for a few years&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair and am not young.</li>
    <li> I love this product but was fooled by the false picture.  These are the small bottles!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years.  Okay for most hair types, both my husband and I use it a couple times a week.</li>
    <li> its okay would not order again</li>
    <li> This is not the exact formula of Morrocanoil that I thought it would be but it is fine. I will have to look much more closely when ordering in the future.</li>
    <li> I have really damaged african american hair (bleached, straightened, keratin treated) and this product makes my hair feel really soft. I am combining it with alterna&#x27;s cc cream so I am not sure which one is the one that is making my hair this soft but I do like it!</li>
    <li> No change for me, may work for someone else. I bought this while I was deployed bc the water was very hard, didn&#x27;t help my hair.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in both the shampoo and conditioner.  This was not the original product in the bottles.  Both items smelled like body odor.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. THE PRODUCT IS FAKE, SMELLS DIFFERENT, FEELS DIFFERENT!!! HORRIBLE. VERY UPSET. DO NOT BUY! FAKE.</li>
    <li> Got delivered super fast and as always, the shampoo and conditioner works it&#x27;s little miracle on my hair! Extremely satisfied customer!!</li>
    <li> The only brand I use! Not only vegan but smells amazing and works wonders on processed hair! Enough said</li>
    <li> I must admit, I was skeptical after reading the negative reviews, but decided to take a chance. My stylist uses Morocan Oil products &amp; I love the fragrance. After using the shampoo &amp; conditioner for a couple of weeks, I am very happy with the results. My hair is soft &amp; shiny, &amp; the fragrance lasts for a day or two. I also use a few drops of Morocan Oil after shampooing for extra conditioning &amp; shine. FYI - my hair is very fine, straight &amp; colored on a regular basis. My only concern is product consistency - not knowing if the next order will be the same:/</li>
    <li> It smells really good and my hair felt great, but it caused a break out on my back. I&#x27;ve never had a break out in my life so I&#x27;m not sure what exactly it was about this product that caused it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil products for at least 5 years and the products I received are definitely not the shampoo or conditioner manufactured by Moroccan Oil.  The shampoo smell is not right at all.  Smells like free and clear laundry detergent to me. The smell and color of the conditioner is off as well.  I compared it to conditioner I already have and it&#x27;s too pigmented and the smell is chemical-like, hard to describe.  I will be purchasing these items at a higher price from a local hair salon.  I will never purchase Moroccan Oil products or any other hair products from Amazon again.  What a shame...</li>
    <li> Only takes a small amount to see hair go from dull, dry, and fly away to a beautiful shine, strength, and styling.  My hair was shedding but Restorative Hair mask took care of that.  I highly recommend &amp;#34;investing&amp;#34; in Moroccan Oil products.</li>
    <li> I have not used the shampoo, but the conditioner is magical. Somehow, it cleanses and conditions hair like nothing I have used. It may be expensive, but a little goes a long way and it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Please do not waist your money on this product. After I read the good and bad reviews, I thought that maybe the bad reviews were an exaggeration, so I still went and bough it. It was the wost experience with a hair product that I ever had. I think that I lost half of my hair trying to untangle it, please believe me. If you want to lose your hair then buy it, other wise stay away.</li>
    <li> I love Moroccan Oil Light and wear it almost every day.  The scent is light but delicious, and it really helps make my hair smooth and shiny.  I was excited to try the shampoo and conditioner but alas, not for me.  The scent was very strong and different than the oil--I can&#x27;t really describe it other than to say my husband and I both found it to be overwhelming and unpleasant.  I remember reading some reviews about how the \\&quot;Moisture Repair\\&quot; set dried people&#x27;s hair out and I should have listened to them!  I&#x27;m not sure how, but my hair felt like straw after using these products.  After two unsuccessful attempts they went straight into the trash.  Oh well, live and learn!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got dry, color-treated hair like me, I recommend Living Proof&#x27;s Repair Shampoo and Conditioner.  It&#x27;s got a clean fragrance, reminds me of white tea, and leaves my hair moisturized without being weighed down.  Exactly what I was hoping the Moroccan Oil would do!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It is my main go to brand when repairing my hair from life. It never disappoints.</li>
    <li> Great d&amp;uacute;o! With in two weeks of use I felt the difference in my hair texture. My hair is a lot softer and shinier. They even smell great</li>
    <li> i love this stuff - we all use it (adult mom, adult daughter, teen daughter...).  it is worth the cost, i cannot go back to anything else.  best part - i only have to wash my hair if i get sweaty or every other day because i don&#x27;t get greasy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great for Brazilian straightened hair, smells great and a little goes a long way. Recommended and okay for every day use.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, hair is soft and manageable after using just once.  Highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s expensive but worth it.  The deep conditioner is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Both products are great to treat damaged hair. The shipping was on time.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I have is that the bottle of the shampoo was crush and I had to transfer it to the one that I had run off.!!!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s just an ok product.I have had better shampoos and conditioners and I have had worse ones. And I wont buy those again just because of the bottles. The bottles are so hard , you can&#x27;t get the product out,especially conditioner.I have to keep my bottles upside down .Even then I still have hard time. I think conditioner should be sold in jars because it is very thick.But I do recommend the Moroccanoil Oil Hair Treatment. It is FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> Really like the way it makes my hair smell and feel. Wish it wasn&#x27;t as expensive as it is though</li>
    <li> Favorite shampoo/conditioner. I have really fine hair and it was pretty dry and unmanageable. This combo has made my hair healthy and it has become lots more manageable!</li>
    <li> I love this duo of Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner. Makes my hair very soft and silky. In my opinion there is no better product on the market. My purchase arrived faster than planned. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love it ...this product smells very good I used the oil and I have heard great things about the shampoo and conditioner so decided to use ..</li>
    <li> did not see any difference to my hair,yes it does not do too much different effect will i buy it again not</li>
    <li> Love the scent every time I shampoo.</li>
    <li> It excellent my hair is shiny and healthy . There are sulfate free not built up in my hair.  Very Happy!!!!</li>
    <li> It &#x27;s a Great Product !! My Hair looks, feels, smells  Wonderful !!  As soon as I see I&#x27;m running low, I Re-Order !!  Love These !!!</li>
    <li> Morroccan Oil is perfect for anyone with dry, brittle hair.  It&#x27;s also perfect for anyone who flat irons or uses heat styling tools on a regular basis.  MO will thoroughly moisturize and protect your hair. Since using MO, I get lots of comments on the health of my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve always had dry hair but now it is shiny and feels great to the touch! I love this product!</li>
    <li> This brand has taken my dry, dull hair and made it touchably soft. Yes it sounds like one of those TV commercials but the difference this time is that it actually happened!</li>
    <li> This product made my color treated hair smooth, shiny, and brought back its moisture. I noticed a big difference with my split ends. I found it to work best shampooing and conditioning one day and just conditioning the next. My hair never looks oily, always healthy.  The price is very affordable compared to the price offered at my salon in Boston, Massachusetts.  I have suggested it to friends and my mom, who has thin color treated hair, uses and loves the results she saw as well.</li>
    <li> Wodnerful for hair and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Great for dry hair.  I don&#x27;t use the conditioner every time as it is too much for hair.  Fabulous product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Leaves hair soft, conditioned,  and full of life. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> This was my trial size.  I love this stuff!  It helps keep my coarse hair soft and I love the smell.  Plus, it&#x27;s much cheaper that at the store.</li>
    <li> it doesnt seem to have that strong Moroccan scent like the volumizing shampoo does.....i mean lets face it, olfactory plays an important part as well as performance. it washes nicely but not heavily scented.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product will never use anything else on my hair!!!!!!!!!  The absolute Best I&#x27;ve ever used!  : )</li>
    <li> As an experienced user of Moroccanoil Shampoo and Conditioner I was dissapointed by the Conditioner.  The product was thin and runny.  The Conditioner that I just purchased from the salon did not in any way resemble the product that was shipped to me. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Shampoo is too heavy and it has no lather. Hair just doesn&#x27;t feel clean. Hair line broke out with acne like issues, even washing every day. Not worth the money for me.</li>
    <li> They both helped repair my damaged, brittle hair and helped make my hair healthy and shine again. An old friend I went to high school with, recommended this!! He&#x27;s a hair stylist vv</li>
    <li> Moisturzing and reduces frizz to my naturally curly hair.  I have recommended this to my daughter and would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I was able to tell a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and in good order.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this product whenever I see her. I decided to purchase my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my hair soft and clean. I wash my hair every other day and it does well to keep it clean during this time. I also find it is easier to straighten my hair after using this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Shampoo, Conditioner and I also use Moroccan Oil before styling. My hair feels smooth and great. Of course I do have to blow dry.</li>
    <li> Love the body and moisture</li>
    <li> A fabulous product which was just reviewed to outstanding raves on the Doctors show this morning,  Go for it!</li>
    <li> «:::P:::» «:::E:::» «:::R:::» «:::F:::» «:::E:::» «:::C:::» «:::T:::»</li>
    <li> Great. Suggest pairing It with the oil as well</li>
    <li> FAKE! Buyer beware! This is NOT Morrocanoil shampoo. I&#x27;m horrified at the thought of what I washed my hair with. The real Morrocanoil shampoo is so smooth that you barely need a conditioner. This stuff left my hair in knots and it&#x27;s so dry. I hope I haven&#x27;t done any long term damage because I pay a fortune to keep my hair healthy. Do not buy this product if you care about your hair.</li>
    <li> Greatest shampoo and conditioner ever.  I have thick, curly hair and this shampoo leaves my hair shiny and helps me blow out my hair straight very easily.  Plus I love the fragrance!</li>
    <li> The conditioner was in good shape, but the shampoo had completely emptied into the package.</li>
    <li> So, as you can see I love Moroccanoil very much. My hair is extremely fine and broken so I was in the market for some shampoo that could help out. Anything you need you can find on Google or YouTube. I found this stuff, which is completely amazing, and my skincare solution on YouTube. It smells pretty amazing too!!</li>
    <li> This Shampoo and conditioner smells so wonderful.  I color my hair and it gives mositure to my hair.  So soft and shiny</li>
    <li> After I used this product I noticed my hair is very dry and brittle, I will NEVER EVER purchase it again through this supplier.&lt;br /&gt;You are definetly not getting what you paid for.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I use the intense conditioner, so between salon trips I wash my hair with this product then flat iron my hair. Afterwards, my hair looks just as good.</li>
    <li> It is the parcelling packaging and strange disappearance of three out of the six bottles ordered which has been extremely distressing. I am a returning Amazon customer and I was shocked to see that this time the parcel with three sets of moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner had only one shampoo and two conditioners instead of three each. These were expensive items and I had as always paid upfront including the postage. However the parcelling was done very shabbily with third rate cardboard the bottle one of them is cracked and half the conditioner had flown out. This has been a very disappointing purchase from Amazon. On contacting the vendor they have happily said this is postal damage. We have bought extremely expensive items as laptops iPad, perfumes, tom Ford cosmetics from Amazon and they have never been damaged. So how can this particular consignment be selectively damaged. Other sites as eBay flipcart etc have much better post damage customer service systems</li>
    <li> it is worth the price.  It leaves my hair so soft and controls the frizz.  it also smells really good.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner. I have tried everything for my frizzy, course hair. This is the best product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, my hair is always healthy shiny. People are always walking up to me  feeling my hair and telling my how beautiful it is. I tell them all it is Moroccanoil hair products. It is not sold locally, so I have to order it.</li>
    <li> Very good and congratulations from order to delivery.</li>
    <li> I really like how it makes my hair feel after I&#x27;ve finished straightening it. However, my husband has a huge issue with the smell - doesn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> My stylist highly recommends this shampoo and I was very excited to try it.  I use the this brand of oil and LOVE it.  I don&#x27;t think this shampoo is any better than stuff off the shelf at the store that costs $1.99.  I have fine thin hair and the conditioner does nothing to help detangle or moisturize.  The shampoo I use and love on a regular basis is Pureology.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t scream that is a fake. I have no way of knowing that but I just am not a fan of Moroccan oil.  I have tried several shampoos/conditioners and just the oil. It does nothing for me.  It is suppose to rock for &#x27;healing&#x27; split ends and adding moisture. No, not so much! My hair is dryer and &#x27;heavier&#x27;.  I do have fine hair should that be the difference. Still, no more Moroccan anything for me.</li>
    <li> it was ok.  I guess I am most happy with just the oil.  LOVE that stuff!!!  A bit on the pricy side if you ask me.</li>
    <li> this is a great product.  Works well with dry hair, colored, fine, straightened hair.  The products available at most stores don&#x27;t do well with my hair so I bought this at a beauty supply place first and then at Amazon.  I definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used the Moroccanoil for curls on the recommendation of my hair stylist.  I decided to try the shampoo &amp; conditioner as well.  This product has added moisture and beauty to my hair just as it advertises that it will!  I&#x27;m sold on the Moroccanoil products!</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this product until it was recommended from a trusted website. When I tried it my fine , straight overly processed hair was either going to have to be cut short or meet up with a miracle. I&#x27;ve always been one to try things , but as far as my hair goes have had little luck and I have tried it all.... expensive, budget smart, home remedies....nothing came close to what I was needing. This was it. Not only did it leave my hair soft but full of body and some volume even when I didn&#x27;t blow dry! Awesome for me. It has no sufates which are damaging to hair. Smell is also important to me, I don&#x27;t like baby powder, musk or fruity, or flowery smells....this is just clean with a bit of spice and not at all overpowering to me. After washing my hair I put the tiniest bit of oil through my hair comb it through and style as usual. First time in many moons I&#x27;m actually getting comments on how healthy my hair looks. My hair stylist was even blown away by the difference. The shampoo/conditioner lasted a month and I wash my hair daily....a little goes a long way. The oil I got in December and still have 3/4 left. All I can say is this is the first and only thing that has worked for me....it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I had never used this S&amp;C before so can&#x27;t be positive, but it was thin, runny, didn&#x27;t smell like the Moroccan Oil I bought from the salon at all and it left my hair dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I frequent Amazon sellers because the Morocconoil products are expensive and I have found Amazon to have the best prices so far.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the best I have ever used. It leaves my hair very shiny and bouncy. The smell is great and can&#x27;t wait to use it when I take a shower. I would recommend this product to anyone having a hard time finding shampoo and conditioner for their hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  Thank you for sending it again.  My daughter is happy to have shampoo and conditioner again.</li>
    <li> At first i was hesitant to pay 35$ for a shampoo and conditioner but, i am glad I did! These products work amazingly well , my hair ( African american texture) was kinky and unmanageable after using this shap. and cond. set along with the hydrating mask . My hair looked and felt soft and healthy (after 1 use!!) i cant wait to see how it will repair my damaged hair  overtime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil products for a few years and I will continue to use them FOREVER! They treat your hair exactly how it needs to be treated and it smells incredible!!!!  I tell everyone about Moroccan Oil, you should definitely try it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to MoroccanOil Shampoo at my hair salon. When my stylist washed my hair it felt great. The end result was that my hair felt very silky and light. Now that I have the product at home, it doesn&#x27;t feel the same. I even have the conditioner but it doesn&#x27;t seem too different than my other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I love marrocain oil... Very happy. W delivery time....&lt;br /&gt;Def recommend for friends...</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner that I have used in a long time. Buy this and I guarantee that you will love the shine, body, and healthy look of your hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome products especially for  my hair which is very light and frizzy</li>
    <li> I have corse hair, this stuff works. Softens up my hair and makes it easy to blow dry and style.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever! I have dry flat damaged hair. I used this and my hair looks and feels healthier. It&#x27;s also much easier to comb through. I absolutely love this!</li>
    <li> Not my type of scent, but does it&#x27;s job to soften hair and making it healthy. Recommend it to anyone of any age.</li>
    <li> I love these products. Per my salons advice, I wash my hair twice (once with my regular shampoo, and second time with Moroccanoil so as not to run out of this shampoo as fast) and follow up with conditioner from my ears down and have great results when straightening my hair. Using these products and following that routine enables me to have 3 days of beautiful straight hair without my hair getting greasy. My hair is now much smoother and softer not having to wash my hair and style my hair every day.</li>
    <li> Works great!! My kids curls really look good after using these products!</li>
    <li> wayyyyy too small  so I was not happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner.  It smells wonderful.  It makes my hair soft and silky without weighing it down.  And a little goes a long way, so you don&#x27;t feel as if you are going through it at lightening speed.  A good thing when the product is expensive.</li>
    <li> Love these products. I have been using for a few years. I get highlights and these keep my hair from being too dry.</li>
    <li> Idk how good it works, but my girlfriend seemed to love the gift.</li>
    <li> I definitely liked the shampoo but wouldn&#x27;t but the conditioner again</li>
    <li> This is wonderfull. It makes my hair look as though it was just conditioned. What a shine and a great smell.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 sets but only received 1</li>
    <li> I used the Moroccan oil all the time and i love it but I tried the shampoo and conditioner and my hair was hard like and couldn&#x27;t  untangle it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I have used the Hydrating for about 2 months now and LOVED it, thought i would give the repair a try. Well, i hate it!!! My hair feels like straw. :( I would not recommend. However i will recommend the Hydrating that the brand carries. That works AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> My stylist uses various Morrocan Oil products.  I like the styling cream and the oil is ok too. makes your hair shiny and blow dries nicely.  I&#x27;ve tried the shampoos, and am not impressed. If you use hair color, DO NOT use the volumizing shampoo as I believe it&#x27;s not gentle enough and although I wash my hair every 2-3 days, I think it washed some of the color out. The moisturizing shampoo is better, but not great.  One n Only has a better shampoo product, honestly, and lots cheaper. The MO volumizing shampoo makes my hair a tangled mess...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would recommend if you want this product to purchase from a salon or beauty supply....the sellers on Amazon seem to have an inferior product.  For other Argan oil products that don&#x27;t strip hair color, try Neuma, it&#x27;s wonderful....lathers better than Morrocan Oil, and while expensive, only requires a small amount to work up a nice lather.</li>
    <li> Split ends are a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> Good for colored hair.</li>
    <li> High quality product!</li>
    <li> Love it! Hair is soft and smells great. Had some lather so hair feels as clean as shampoo with sulfates. Only bad is the cost.</li>
    <li> great scent and very moisturising</li>
    <li> Love this, works really well.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo and shipped when they said it would be shipped</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my little sister and she loved it! That stuff worked miracles on her hair! After years of using commercial shampoo I figured I should give her something a little more nice. Anyway, so after she had dried her hair, it was like pure silk! It&#x27;s so good I might just buy some more for myself later. :)I kinda wish the product had been in a box so that wrapping wouldn&#x27;t have been so big an issue, but oh well. It all worked out in the end. It&#x27;s still a great product that made for a wonderful gift.</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, this is the real deal. I tend towards really dry hair and using this (and only washing my hair twice a week) totally turned things around for me.</li>
    <li> I just recently ordered the light oil, the repair treatment, and now the shampoo and conditioner. This stuff is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s really an excellent product. I took a star away because of it&#x27;s outrageous price for such a small amount.</li>
    <li> tamed my frizzy hair and leave it smooth and shining! finally!  I have coarse Asian hair and it is very damaged due to hair straightening.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave Moroccan Oil 2 stars is because it smells nice. I love their glimmer shine spray and hair sprays, but the shampoo and conditioner, not so much. Try Orofluido Shampoo and Mask (not the conditioner, it is not good). It smells better too, Amber and Vanilla. mmmmmmmmmm</li>
    <li> Tried this product on my very dry hair while on vacation.  Had to have some of my own when I got home. There is a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version of this product which may be more suitable for those with more oily hair or those who don&#x27;t like a heavier conditioner.  My ends are very dry so it works for me.  I do alternate it with other shampoos so I don&#x27;t get that over conditioned feel.</li>
    <li> I have used Moroccan Oil products off and on for about 2 years now.  This past summer, I went on the \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; blonde craze. (Code for I could not get my hair blonde enough, and therefore now have dried and damaged areas).  Recently I searched on Amazon for the Moroccan Oil products and was pleased at the prices and products available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference that Moroccan Oil has caused with my hair is amazing.  If you have never tried it, you should at least go to a salon that carries these products and try it once.  Moroccan Oil is perfect for colored/dry/damaged hair.  It infuses your hair with Argan Oil and Keratin, two important ingredients for shiny and healthy hair.  If you have ever seen the hair commercials where the models are swinging their hair, and wondered how they can get it so shiny, I promise you that Argan Oil was used somewhere in that shiny hair equation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, Moroccan Oil is a wonderful hair care treatment option for us ladies (and gents) who have dry damaged hair and need a corrective treatment plan in place to reverse the damaging affects from chemicals and sun.</li>
    <li> I really like this product but I do wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. My hair feels great and looks shinny</li>
    <li> I bought these products because my hair stylist highly recommended them and Amazon&#x27;s price is better than the salon, but every time I use it my hair is dry and flyaway. It&#x27;s supposed to moisturize but does the opposite.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It makes my hair look much better than it does with other high-end shampoo&#x27;s and conditioner&#x27;s.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The product came with both caps broken, so I have to twist off the top to use the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product INSIDE the bottles is great though. Fast shipping also.</li>
    <li> FAKE! I have been using Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner for years. I recently purchased from Beauty in Style....and what I received was NOT the real product. I know what the shampoo and conditioner should smell like. They did not smell the same, look the same, even the texture was different. I would be wary on who you purchase this product from. Moroccanoil is a great product, but it seems the bottles are probably filled with something else.</li>
    <li> love this product on my hair,and the price is not that bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products and since I love the moroccan oil&#x27;s hair treatment (argan oil) I thought I&#x27;d give the shampoo and conditioner a try but they didn&#x27;t work well on my curly hair. I found it impossible to untangle my hair with this conditioner.</li>
    <li> The shampoo gets my hair clean without drying it out. The conditioner is very good for hydrating my thick treated hair. I&#x27;m not a fan of buying sets since I always run out of conditioner faster since I use more.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner actually makes my hair feel like hair, rather than a nasty bale of hay. It&#x27;s the only product I use now!</li>
    <li> Not the real Moroccanoil!! The conditioner does not condition your hair and the shampoo leaves hair dry and brittle. My recommendation is to go too a hair salon in your area that sells the real deal. You will spend more but it will actually do what you are paying for. Buyer beware....you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Smella really great and works well.</li>
    <li> For starters, I have thick, coarse, fairly damaged hair (due to years of highlighting). I must say, the shampoo and conditioner smell amazing. However, the products left my hair looking limp and greasy. It&#x27;s a shame, I had really high hopes for these products. I use the Moroccan Oil from this brand religiously and it&#x27;s wonderful so I figured the shampoo and conditioner must be great too. Nope. I&#x27;ll stick with my Joico K Pak from now on. I&#x27;m happy it seems to have worked for so many others though :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Moroccan Oil Products. I have naturally curly hair but blow it out every other day or so.  I find that this shampoo/conditioner helps keep my hair healthy and moisturized without too much weight or greasiness.  This set came quickly and is as great as ever.  Love, Love, LOVE.</li>
    <li> Besides that I got the product onetime and it was just as described it is a very good product for your hair you can totally notice the before and after. Moroccanoil</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I have been using this product for a year now, and I wont give it up! My hair is shiny and healthy now</li>
    <li> If your hair is bleached or dyed, this product will not restore your hair. I am a blonde hair with very delicate hair, and this product did not make a difference in my hair at all. I heard the oil they have is good, but their shampoo and conditioner is not worth the price.</li>
    <li> For the price, not worth it . I didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> I have been blessed with fairly good hair all my life, but using this shampoo and conditioner takes my hair from good to great.  I had tried other more costly products (Aveda, Oribe, etc), but I&#x27;ve been completely wowed by this duo. I find that it gives my normally flat hair a decent amount of volume even if I don&#x27;t blow it out myself. I&#x27;m also impressed with the softness and sheen.  Most other shampoos and conditioners tend to dry out my hair, but these do not.  They are well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have dry and thin hair that has always caused me problems since I hit puberty (plus being in the military with my hair in a bun for weeks at a time didn&#x27;t help). When I became a civilian, I chose to take excellent care of myself again, and this included getting my hair back in shape. I was given Moroccan Oil products by my hair stylist who helped me avoid chopping it all off-- the product worked extremely well. My hair was more manageable, less frizzy, less tangly, and I saw an increase in how straight my hair was as opposed to random wave. However, after a year and a half of use, I have come to know the dark side of this product. I simply can&#x27;t use it anymore. Since I have thin hair, it is very sensitive to buildup which is the entire hat trick to this product. Now that I have used it for so long, my hair is breaking much more easily than it ever did. Imagine coating a tiny fiber with wax, letting it seal, then cracking it in half a year later and you have Moroccan oil with my hair. Getting off of it is also difficult-- if you use it for a while, you come to rely on this buildup, so by ending use of the product your hair becomes unpredictable and frizzy.  I think it is a good investment for people trying to treat themselves, and maybe using it every few months is a good idea. But to do it right, avoid sulfates (easy enough these days), stay Natural, and if you feel your hair is \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; after washing it stop using the product and move on to the next. Good luck!!!</li>
    <li> this product has repair my hair to the natural way it should, look like. it has repair the structure of it and it fills more natural.</li>
    <li> Counterfeit product.  This is definitely not real.  The shampoo smelled like cooking spices and the conditioner smelled like detergent.  It arrived squished, packed in a book shipper.</li>
    <li> Does well for naturally curly, hair that is in the pool a lot!</li>
    <li> I love it leaves my hair healthy shiny just wonderful I am so happy I found this products all of the products are great</li>
    <li> Love the Morrocan Oil, mousse, and curl cream for my hair!  Perhaps I expected too much from the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  It didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference from anything that can be purchased in a drugstore.  I will probably go back to Aveda shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purched  !</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever. Smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> This is not real Moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner. It looks the same, smells the same, but it left my hair feeling like I had washed it with wax and the smell didn&#x27;t linger in my hair like it does with the real stuff. I returned it. What a bummer.</li>
    <li> I am a black women and have thin, wavy hair and my hair dresser uses this product and suggested that I use the same.  I found out that Amazon sells this item cheaper then other stores.  Great stuff for your hair, smells great, lathers good, gives hair nice moisture and leaves hair feeling silky and smooth.  After using this product, I noticed that my hair is more manageable, repairs brittle ends and leaves not residue.  I would definitely buy these products again.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever!</li>
    <li> My Wife is a Natl Certified Hair and Make up Specialist. She has used this on me and herself also for many year and Highly reccomends this product .</li>
    <li> I purchased the Morroccan oil volumizing shampoo and rinse at a local hair salon  for $65.  I was hoping to purchase online at a discount.  This set was less expensive by $20, but was not a good as the volumizing type.  Still an outstanding product, but for my thin 71 year old head of hair - I need more oomph.</li>
    <li> I only buy good product for my hair and this is one of the TOP products. Smooth, clean, easy to comb through and my hair is an unruly mess. This product helps!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not working at all, my hair still dry. It seems it&#x27;s not real one. I don&#x27;t suggest to buy it</li>
    <li> These products have definitely improved my color treated hair immensely. Will continue to purchase as a set.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> When you purchase this product, it obviously isn&#x27;t the genuine morrocanoil shampoo and conditioner, or it is an extremely older version of it. Even with that said, I still feel it works the same as if it were the real morrocanoil product though. Even though it works, I won&#x27;t be buying it from amazon any longer, even if it costs less then buying it over at the salon. I feel like in a way I got ripped off.</li>
    <li> My hair feels and smells wonderful and is soft and manageable when I use this brand. It has really helped my hair tolerate the winter weather better. And did I mention the smell? There is nothing like it!!</li>
    <li> love these products!!!</li>
    <li> this is a great product all together! However, I have noticed the biggest difference in my dry, staticy winter hair. It doesnt exist anymore! It hydrates and creates shine without weighing it down ( I dont wash my hair every day). The later factor isnt big, but I think thats because it doesnt contain as many sulfates as other shampoos, which is a plus. This is certainly worth the price. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Be careful who you buy from, Ive bought some bad batches that didnt smell like they should and work as well as other. Knock-offs, Im assuming.</li>
    <li> Maybe a little more expensive than others, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Can only buy in salons.&lt;br /&gt;Never goes on sale, but they may have a promotion occasionally (during holidays)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about this at all but my mother got it for Christmas and she loves the stuff, so I guess that&#x27;s a good rating if ever there was one?</li>
    <li> I love this set! Leaves you with smooth, hydrated hair.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner,best for dry and damaged hair.I recommend this product to everyone.My hair is naturally curly,Frizzy hair,after using this shampoos my hair is smooth shiny!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the way these products make my hair shine and they smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product came and got to say very small size bottle for the amount i paid. i havnt noticed that my hair is healthier however the smell stays a very long time. smells great. i have using product for about 2 weeks now.</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccanoil products.  I use these in combination with the frizz control and treatment.  It seems to work very well together.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they could get the cost down because I know everyone that has dry, course and frizzy hair would use this in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> My wife has coarse, wavy hair and this shampoo and conditioner help to keep her curls in check.  She&#x27;s used other name shampoos and conditioners, but none of them has given her the control that Moroccan Oil does.  Besides, the fragrance is really nice too!  She does not use these products every day, but a few times per week.  And as a swimmer, the shampoo and conditioner mitigate the effects of chlorine.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My thick long hair just drinks it up.</li>
    <li> great shampoo for dry hair.  I wear my hair natural and this helps</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!  Item was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Works just as described, highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It makes my hair really soft and easy to manage.  The reason for rating of four is due to amazons packaging, Must be better. My conditioner had leaked all in the box upon opening on arrival.</li>
    <li> I love these means. I buy them already for the third time. my hair are fine with them.</li>
    <li> thought this was the answer to my prayers after using the Moroccan oil before drying and styling my hair. with the shampoo and conditioner I thought I couldn&#x27;t lose. I was wrong. the smell is still incredibly awesome, no other hair product can compete with that, but for the shampoo and conditioner to be not really clean my head and then leave it feeling chalky was a let down. plus it&#x27;s overpriced for the size.</li>
    <li> I was excited about using these products as I have very dry, frizzy hair.  It did not live up to my expectations.  I went to get my haircut this past weekend and she told me I have a white flaky coating all around the crown of my head.  I am discontinuing this product immediately.</li>
    <li> I have been using Morocan Oil Products for about six months now, mu hair has never behaved better! Must Buy!</li>
    <li> I haven seen any difference on my hair it my take some more use&lt;br /&gt;it take two time the amount of regular shampoo to clean you hair not is not cheap</li>
    <li> Really softened my hair.</li>
    <li> Not only the smell but also how my hair feels!!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, but I have purchased other Moroccan oil products with success. It didn&#x27;t agree with my hair, though, and I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I love it, There are very  good products .My hair was repaired and softer than previous!</li>
    <li> Everything arrived fine.  I have no negative comment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set for three weeks and have noticed an improvement in softness.  I would recommend more than a quarter size amount for the shampoo (if you have medium to long hair).  It takes quite a bit to work up a lather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using moroccanoil for years, this stuff is awesome. Ignore the negative reviews, I&#x27;ve heard some customers on here don&#x27;t even buy the product and leave negative reviews just to get attention. I bought this product from this seller Beauty In Style and didn&#x27;t have no problems. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Arrived beautifully packed and I have already used it twice and my hair seems to be calming down a bit.</li>
    <li> The product meets my every expectation. The seller&#x27;s service was good, had a problem with the packaging as it leaked a bit, but it was still okay considering how far it travelled.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product that does not dry my coarse, colored hair out. My hair feels like silk! Love the Oil also!</li>
    <li> I have colored hair and thought it will help my hair to look not freezy. But nope, it didn&#x27;t work. After washing with this shampoo my hair looked like a mop, conditioner didn&#x27;t help at all. Wouldn&#x27;t recomend.</li>
    <li> I love love the smell of these products.  I haven&#x27;t used long enough to decide if it helps my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Moroccan oil s&amp;c for a long time on and off... I usually buy it from my salon but got it online. I&#x27;m 100% certain that was not the real stuff. It made my hear dry, brittle and break. I even used my nano puerology  afterward to try and get my hair stuff and it&#x27;s still dry....DO NOT BUY ONLINE. IT&#x27;S FAKE.</li>
    <li> I love love love this shampoo and conditioner.  It is concentrated so you don&#x27;t need huge amounts.  I have thick long brown hair and this shampoo makes my hair soft and has the lovely moroccanoil scent that I love.  I started using the moroccanoil years ago and finally budgeted these into my salon visit.  Worth the price.  This will be my mom&#x27;s christmas gift.</li>
    <li> These products really saved my hair. From being very damaged, and just getting worse from each wash, my hair is now repaired and stronger with a lot of help from Moroccan Oil. Definitely a recommendation!!</li>
    <li> Real product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Bought these for my girlfriend.  Love the way they smell.  Wish the price would be a little lower though.</li>
    <li> I bought some Moroccaoil leave in conditioner at my hairderss and fell love with the smell and the feel of my hair afterwards. So when I saw that I could buy it on line I snatched it up. After using it a few times I have had people stop me and say how good my hair smells. So now I have bought other products of theirs.</li>
    <li> These do so good in my hair, I have used them before and really loved it.  I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have the oil. Thinking it was going to have a great effect on my hair, I was mistaken. The shampoo was okay but the conditioner was something I hated. It did not feel like my hair was even conditioned. I had to recondition it with my normal conditioner. I ended up throwing them away.</li>
    <li> This shampoo did not irritate my scalp because it lacks sulfates, so I love it.  I don&#x27;t normally use a conditioner but this one was as nice as the shampoo is. Fortunately I don&#x27;t need a conditioner with this shampoo -- it is so soft and shiny without lit.  My hair stylist recommended this duo to me and even gave me the Oil (which I can massage into my scalp for relief from dry, itchy scalp) and actually a professional set of the whole line (she and I are also good friends) for my birthday 2 years ago. I actually do not know of another Oil that I could let TOUCH my sensitive scalp, so I hope they never stop making this wonderful product.  I am 73 and have dry, coarse (her word, not mine) hair and this shampoo is absolutely wonderful for me.  I would definitely purchase this from Amazon if I could not get it from my friend/stylist.</li>
    <li> Moroccan oil works great! Delivery was on time!</li>
    <li> This product would be great for eyeryday hair use...although, I use it every few days or so. Keeps moisture in without keeping hair flat.</li>
    <li> I have only one exact word to describe it - terrific! !!!!</li>
    <li> Wow this smells like heaven and really hydrated my dry hair. My hair was brittle but now its bounce is back!</li>
    <li> My hair is quite dry in the summer, the conditioner and shampoo really make a difference in my hair. Fun treat for yourself.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful! And when my hair is dry it does feel soft and smell good.  However. I feel it&#x27;s really expensive and most expensive shampoos go a long way but I feel like I have to use more of this then normal.  When I&#x27;m using it in the shower my hair feels awful! I normally wash my hair then put a conditioner on, use my fingers to brush the conditioner in, but w this, not a chance I can&#x27;t even brush it when it&#x27;s wet. I wait till its dry.  Guess it works for some hair type really well, just not mine.  I have thick, fine, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I have maturing hair with all the difficulties that go wit it: thinning, dryness, etc.  I love this shampoo.  It is the perfect fit for me and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything along with high end options.  It leaves my hair conditioned and in good shape without being too conditioned and oily.  It also has a bounce that I&#x27;ve not had with other products.  My daughter introduced me to it and now all the females in my family swear by it.  You won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> If you are debating whether or not to buy this product - don&#x27;t hesitate! It&#x27;s awesome! I will be buying more soon..</li>
    <li> Best hair care AND makes hair smell AWESOME!  Even my teenage son said my hair smelled good haha! :) I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have plain Jane hair and I want it to look glossy. This weighed my hair down a little. Never felt quite clean... I think I just need a lighter version.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love how it makes my hair feel!  I highly recommend this product!  A little pricey, but worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this product and took a chance purchasing it..I have very curly thick hair and I color it. I live in an area where we have a well and although we have a water treatment system all shampoos dont work the same.  These products helped with flyaways and unruly hair...I would recommend it...I would hate to think that it isn&#x27;t the real product but I took the chance anyway...no regrets</li>
    <li> I love both of these!  They do wonders!</li>
    <li> I had to stop using the shampoo and conditioner because my hair felt so weighted down and greasy. I did not like it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Have been using the oil for years on my natural hair</li>
    <li> I have fine blonde hair that is long and tangles easily,  I&#x27;m not sure how to describe my hair type other than it seems dry during the day and becomes oily if I don&#x27;t wash it every morning.  It&#x27;s usually difficult to brush through, wet or dry, but Moroccanoil makes it extremely easy to do so.  My hair is also much fuller and insanely soft.  It is expensive but well worth it for me.</li>
    <li> safe packaged in a bubble envelope. This product is excellent.  I already used 3 bottles. Smells lovely too.</li>
    <li> The product I recieved is not anything like the Moroccan oil products I purchased from a salon. I am very very disappointed!!! Waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Just started using this about two months ago and has made a  huge difference in my hair breaking and falling out. Love this product. A bit pricey but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and makes her hair look great and smells great.Will be ordering it again because the price was right and recieved very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used other Moroccan oil hair products before, but this brand is remarkable.  My hair looks and feels great!  It is kind of pricey, but well worth the expense when it makes my hair look so good.</li>
    <li> Too soon to say.  Seems great so far.</li>
    <li> Great product, but was delayed in delivering vs the other items order</li>
    <li> Good price. I&#x27;m a little suspicious buying online but it looked and smelled like the product that I purchased at a local beauty salon.</li>
    <li> Outstanding  Price !!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to bring frizzy hair under control.  I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  I have no real complaints about this product but due to the price I&#x27;m going to look for something else.</li>
    <li> But the product, in my opinion, is overrated. I really don&#x27;t see any difference between this and any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used which is a quarter of the price.</li>
    <li> I love it for my hair and my daughter&#x27;s who is mixed. I am so happy with the results with two totally different hair types.</li>
    <li> LOVE this shampoo and conditioner!! I&#x27;ve used Fekkai in the past as well as a wide selection of more pedestrian shampoo/conditioners in my life and Moroccanoil is by far the best. It leaves my (thick &amp; straight) hair super shiny and soft yet not LIMP (which I hate!).</li>
    <li> Nice scent, and you do not need a lot  of it to use on your hair. Rinse is rather heavy so don&#x27;t use  much. Gives hair  th smooth look.</li>
    <li> Took a very long time to arrive.  Product had leaked and a fair amount was wasted before I had a chance to use it!</li>
    <li> Best products ...make my dry hair shiny and silkyZ,</li>
    <li> I started losing hair with this product. I like the conditioner but the shampoo killed my hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner really makes my hair so soft. And I swear my hair seems to be growing faster. Love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> My mother has very fine wavy/curly asian hair, and she loves this shampoo. She says she likes the feel and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a slightly thicker straight/wavy hair (also asian) and I&#x27;m happy with this shampoo, but I wouldnt buy it for myself. The deep conditioner from this line is really great, it makes your hair feel really soft, but generally speaking, I don&#x27;t really like the smell - it&#x27;s a bit too strong for me.</li>
    <li> Unlike most reviewers that give products a 3 or 2 when they haven&#x27;t even seen if the product works yet, I will give it a 5 but if I see that the product is not living up to the hype, then I will lower the review stars without any hesitations. I have been eyeing the product for some time now but the price has put me off which is a bit weird because I am known to purchase a lot of Alter Ego products. I hope it does what it says. It is a best seller after all.</li>
    <li> This product works well with my natural, curly hair. I used the shampoo and the conditioner combination and noticed right away that this is not the product to use if you want to keep your curls. After use, my curls were less coiled which was a surprise to me. Although not exactly what I was going for, I didn&#x27;t mind since I normally straighten out my hair with a hot iron and curl the ends with a curly iron anyway.  I also used the Treatment Moroccan oil (Light) on my wet hair and to my pleasant surprise, I discovered the trick my Dominican hair dresser used to straighten my hair to a fine and smooth texture. The Argan oil responds well to high heat and made straightening my hair easier. My hair is smooth, smells great and looks like I had it professionally done. The one disappointment is that I was also hoping that It would untangle my wet hair, but that didn&#x27;t happen, even after applying the oil. I still had to use a separate spray for that. This is an expensive product but I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> When I used this product, I immediately felt a difference with my hair. Thank you so much for delivering such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Had previously bougt this from my beauty salon, ran out and the salon didn&#x27;t have it. Ordered from Amazon and received it quickly. This is a great product for colored hair and it lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil hair procucts not only make hair soft and feel wonderful, but repair the hair. All the moroccanoil hair products I have used have added to a more healed, wonderful feeling head of hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> This works great. Leaves your hair very soft and hydrated. The shampoo is good if your hair is not very dirty. I suggest buying another shampoo for your dirty hair days.</li>
    <li> The product was sent correctly and meet my expectations. It has an excellent quality. Indico this seller.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have coarse, frizzy,dry hair and the Morrocan Oil brand is a good quality product especially for my kind of hair.  My hair stylist recommended it to me and i&#x27;ve been using it since.</li>
    <li> This is suppose to be a repair but it left my hair dry and frizzy and tangled. It did not moisturize my colored hair at all.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend says this is the best shampoo and conditioner out there. Her hair has never been softer or healthier in its entire life! Its a great deal and it works wonders!</li>
    <li> I love this set together, the shipping was ontime and the product was everything I was hoping for. Smells great! And makes my hair look healthy. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> my iron etc is normal. next step is scalp biopsy . ..i have done the biotin. it does work. my hair does grows fine. ...thats not a problem for me. I&#x27;m growing weak fine hair with no elasticity, breaks off or falls out by the roots. spend more energy money into keeping my hair and the length. also thyroid is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moroccanoil hair product line is divine and &#x27;ITs a 10&#x27; is 2nd best on my 3c,4a,4b  hair texture&lt;br /&gt; compared to Amika, nexus, terax, photo, frederic fekkai, giovanni, joico, affirm, dudleys, shea moisture, Design essential etc. ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also use aloe vera leaf juice and lil bit of lime and black tea from distilled water mix carrot seed oil, rosemary oil,basil oil with Eqyss conditioner to moisturize but have to refrigerate after each use. to keep the aloe vera fresh.  seal with coconut, grape seed oil,  overnight.&lt;br /&gt;also invested in Kent combs (believe they are seamless smoother on the hair and durable. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;might be just bad DNA although my family has long thick hair on both sides. maybe i got the bad DNA. anyhow for my hair type its makes my hair feel and look better in conjunction with daily natural hair routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i alternate between 2x week between &#x27; Is A 10&#x27; AND Moroccan hydrate+repair system. only regret is. taking so long to try it along time ago. I LOVE line systems!</li>
    <li> I started using the MoroccanOil cream and loved it, so I was excited to get the shampoo and conditioner but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s working any better then my old stuff. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Moroccan oil products have been the best find for my hair!  I was so frustrated with my frizzies and really wanted my hair to be more smooth and soft without having to flat iron daily!  Combined with the oil these products make my hair look and feel great!</li>
    <li> Was not impressed at all really I don&#x27;t know if I need to maybe try another one or not. Hate to spend that much on product and not be satisfied.</li>
    <li> This brand is awesome...shampoo / conditioner makes hair feel smooth and shiny.  I recommend the hairspray, smoothing cream and oil!  Products are worth the money...</li>
    <li> These did not work for my hair, maybe because my hair is thin and gets oily very easily. This combo makes my hair feel heavy. The conditioner by itself if OK, but the combo did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  Repaired my natural hair (I am (African American) after over processing within 4 months of regular use.  My new stylist recommended it, and boy was she right.  I use it with the Moroccanoil styling oil, and now my hair is stronger and longer.  Perfect combination!</li>
    <li> Thank you it&#x27;s amazing item</li>
    <li> Tried this duo once, and have never stopped since.  I also include Moroccanoil prior to blow drying too!  The threesome is perfect for all types of hair.  I happen to have a Keratiin blow out and it supports it well, no tangles!  BEST!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair vever looked better.  It is silky and has more body.  I will now order in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to smell the same as the bottle I purchased from salon</li>
    <li> Like this product works well and is good for my dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think its a bit pricey however for the amount.</li>
    <li> I love Moroccanoil Shampoo it&#x27;s the Only shampoo where I have ever noticed a difference and it smells awesome.  It was my error that I ordered a different flavor--the repair shampoo and conditioner.  I&#x27;m not sure what I had before of the Moroccanoil but I liked it better.  It&#x27;s still the Best shampoo though.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. GREAT PRODUCT... I JUST LOVE THE WAY IT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL.. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> So good to find a good deal on Moroccanoil products here at Amazon. They are expensive, but worth it. They are gentle and moisturizing, without leaving hair greasy.</li>
    <li> i love the oil and was curious about how the shampoo and conditioner would be. it turned out to be ok...i wasn&#x27;t very impressed. the scent is fine, but the consistency is relatively thin. i thought it might be ok, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be as hydrating as expected.</li>
    <li> the best thing is the perfume...</li>
    <li> makes my hair soft and smooth and the smell is to die for :)</li>
    <li> Great products.  Recommend all their hair care and styling products!</li>
    <li> The best shampoos for dry hair that I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the styling cream and thought this would help with my frizzies.  It feels good on my scalp, makes my hair more lively and smells wonderful.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase and the price is great too!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell exactly like they do in the salon, however the shampoo really dries my hair out. I only use the conditioner which works great.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be unsatisfactory for my hair.  It left it sticky, yet not &amp;#34;tamed&amp;#34; either.  I have naturally curly hair, very dry due to medical issues.  The Miroccan oil my hair dresser used worked well -- this did not help at all.</li>
    <li> This is not the real Moroccan oil shampoo. It dried out my hair and removed its shine. I would never buy is product again unless it was from a salon.</li>
    <li> Amazing, this is the best product I have ever used! I have colored hair that is curly and somewhat fine but thick and will look dry and fly away. I&#x27;ve been using a top French brand for years until I found this product...no comparson. I look like I steped out of a salon every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I first used this line of products in Lake Tahoe at a spa resort. I loved the oil and noted that they had the entire line in the spa showers. After a massage and work out I washed and conditioned my hair with this produt. I have very long thick hair and it was so smooth an silky that I didn&#x27;t have to use a flat iron. The smell is great and you will love your hair! Great for any type of hair!!</li>
    <li> These products are amazing! They make my hair so soft and smooth. I will be ordering the larger sizes as soon as I get done with this bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using these shampoos for a while and I love how they leave my hair.  My hair has become so much healthier and shinier than it used to be.  I alternate with another shampoo, so that the product will last me longer! Highly recommend escially for thick, wavy dry hair!</li>
    <li> Foi um pedido. Quem usa afirma que funciona bem. Excelente para dar de presente. &amp;Eacute; da linha MoroccanOil, j&amp;aacute; bem conhecida e de qualidade.</li>
    <li> Love Moroccanoil hair treatment products. Leaves hair moisturized and shiny, just like after coiffeur.&lt;br /&gt;(Nothing more to say. Nothing more to say.)</li>
    <li> The best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  It really lathers good and leaves my hair full of body.  I have a little natural curl and this makes it come to life.</li>
    <li> Great product! I got it fairly quickly</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner.  I will definitely be purchasing it again.  I really like the smell, which I think is kind of musty.  That is shampoo.  The conditioner really doesn&#x27;t have much of scent to it.  Good for dry hair and processed hair.</li>
    <li> A little more expensive than I would like, but very moisturizing, leaves my hair very soft.  Pretty much makes it worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Love love love this combo!!! Smells super good and makes my hair looks beautiful and soft. Definitely will be purchasing more of this brand.</li>
    <li> The whole line of products are awesome! Love all of them. Used this one, treatment for dry-no-more, oil hair treatment and moose. All great! This one made my hair so much more manageable and easier to comb/style. Lastly, I really love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I have falling hair and they are quite thin, I used the &amp;#34;Extra volume&amp;#34; below and it works wonder!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWJF2K/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B005CWJF2K&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;justckem-20</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that softens my coarse gray hair. Leaves it shiny and manageable.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great product i love it for my self, and i even bath my little dog with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a solid product but I have fine hair and I was expecting this to be a bit more like the volume version (detangling) and yet it is not. It has, however, been pretty good for keeping my hair in good shape. Also, a good alternative to some of the more expensive items from Aveda or similar kind.</li>
    <li> It seemed like the product is diluted. Is not the same product I get at the salon</li>
    <li> My hair always feels super soft after using this product!!! I&#x27;ve since invested in the heat protecting spray, also a great product!</li>
    <li> I love all the Moroccanoil products. I have fine hair and these worked great for me until I got pregnant and my hair changed a little. I now use the extra volume shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Smells great but doesn&#x27;t do much for my damaged bleached hair. Suave works the same for much less.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it makes my hair feel so soft that i can not help but to use it once a week. I use the brand and i stick to the products that are best for my hair. I use the oils, the restoratve mask and more. I think anyone looking for healthier hair should try it!</li>
    <li> Vera fast Shipment and my wife liked this Product . I loved it. I beleive that is good Product. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased a travel size at a local beauty supply store; love the smell and the way my hair feels. Its contains no sulfeits and safe for color treated hair. Good price for product.</li>
    <li> Smells great. My favorite product :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using moroccanoil shampoo and condition for about a year now. I have fine long hair and I definitely notice a difference when I use this product in combination with a few drops of argan oil after washing my hair; my hair is shinier and smoother, and I love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I would caution is that while the product is shipped in bubble wraps, I received my order (shampoo and conditioner) drenched in products upon opening the package. Apparently somewhere along the delivery, the caps became open, and I ended up with product spillage. I think it would be nice if the shippers put a dab of masking tape over the caps to prevent spillage in the future.</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo and conditioner from Moroccan oil .Use for keratin treated hair is best.Excellent product and you need so little amount to get the result ;wish it was cheaper .</li>
    <li> First time using and it&#x27;s been good it smells great too but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price really it feels like regular shampoo&amp;  conditioner</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance but am not really impressed by the conditioner, which does not give my hair a silky feeling.  I wish they would sell  shampoo and conditioner separately.</li>
    <li> Better price than salon for excellent products!</li>
    <li> Goes into your hair shoo nicely.  I was afraid it might make it heavy or greasy, but not at all. IT ALSO MAKES YOUR HAIR SMELL WONDERFUL!  Not overpowering, just a great fresh scent!</li>
    <li> Good product, but too expensive</li>
    <li> My favorite hair products, heck I love all Moroccanoil hair and body products. Very concentrated so it lasts and the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> My daughter love this product. Her hair look and feel awesome. Wish was more affordable, and easy to find. You only can buy online.</li>
    <li> I have used it once or twice at my sisters but could not afford it.  Then I decided to look on Amazon.  So worth the price. Do not know what happened to the conditioner.  The top was taped down but it still leaked a good bit out.</li>
    <li> That is how I feel about my hair when I use this combo . My hair looks and feel fabulous ! iiit is smoothe and soft but still has great body. You donb&#x27;t much as it works so well and i have long hair.</li>
    <li> My scalp is very dry and weather in the Midwest certainly doesn&#x27;t help. This shampoo keeps my head flake-free and my hair extremely soft. If it were completely up to me I would never switch to another product!</li>
    <li> First of all I recommend buying this product on amazon instead of the website or at a salon. My salon charges $48 for this same pack. I don&#x27;t know about the faulty products some of you received or think you did but my review is on the real thing. The conditioner should be very thick. Both are amazing but I usually only just need the conditioner. It&#x27;s very saturated with oil and you only need A LITTLE. I apply it to my ends then middle parts of my hair strands and comb it through. Never to the root because this product can take away the volume from your hair if you use too much. I have split ends because I got ombre highlights (the ends of my hair bleached) from dark brown to very blonde so my hair was very unhealthy and the ends would frizz. The best thing about this product is that it makes your hair so soft, without having to get oil all over your hands and accidentally apply too much with hair oils. It&#x27;s a very good deep conditioner and the shampoo and conditioner work best with both but my hair has gotten so healthy I only need one. When I&#x27;m in a rush some days I skip conditioner and my hair still remains soft because of this. I absolutely recommend this to anyone with frizzy, dry hair or chemically processed hair.</li>
    <li> my hairdresser had used this shampoo and conditioner on me in her shop....when I found it on Amazon I was so excited.  It is the most luxurious...smell is awesome</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t care for this. i never break out and this product made me break out terribly all over my chin area :( didn&#x27;t end up using it all.</li>
    <li> My favorite stuff ever. I have a family of cosmetologists. I have tried every shampoo and conditioner from the moon and back. This is still my #1.</li>
    <li> The whole line of products are awesome! Love all of them. The smell lovely and work like charm!!! Used this one, treatment for dry-no-more, oil hair treatment and moose. All great!</li>
    <li> Same shampoo and conditioner as the salon but at affordable prices. A little bit goes a long way. Lasts a long time. Great bargain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that great.  I thought it would tame my frizz so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to style my hair.  It&#x27;s about the same as other shampoo in terms of outcome on frizzy hair.  At least for me. Save your money and buy a serum.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and pleasant smelling</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!! Great price !</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and the way it smells is heavenly</li>
    <li> Makes hair shiny and smells great. You don&#x27;t have to use as much as you would with other shampoos and conditioners so make it last since it is quite pricey.</li>
    <li> Although both the shampoo and conditioner smelled awesome, after the wash and condition, my hair was still very tangled...make that extremely tangled. Even though I have completely used both products, I cannot tell if my hair is in better shape than it was before I started using it. I will probably have to continue to use it for longer than 1 month to see any difference.</li>
    <li> Love all Moroccanoil products! Smells great and makes my hair feel softer than any other shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this product per my hair stylist recommendation. I have no complaints. Shampoo and conditioner shipped in good condition and I do not feel I got a fake product as others have reviewed. It is cheaper than salon price and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The bottles are small for the price but the description states clearly how much volume is in each of them. Having never gotten Moroccanoil shampoo or conditioner from a salon, I can&#x27;t compare these against the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; version but the scent matches my Moroccan hair oil and keeps my hair soft. My hairdresser is my sister in law and she hasn&#x27;t complained about my hair being dry or funky. I&#x27;m not using the product now because I have since dyed my hair red and am using red pigment shampoo and conditioner, but it&#x27;s still in my shower and i have used it on my kids&#x27; hair once or twice when their hair was particularly dry and resembled broom straw. I likely wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again because the bottles are indeed small for the price but the product seems legit.</li>
    <li> I do not wash my hair daily but once a week or when i have put a lot of products in my hair. The conditioner I use as a co-wash every few days to keep my hair feeling soft and smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazing and makes my hair so nice and soft but not too flat.</li>
    <li> This is a great pair, works very well, just a little pricey.&lt;br /&gt;This is my statement period period period period</li>
    <li> My hair felt really soft and more moisture than I&#x27;ve had with other products. Both the shampoo and conditioner smelled really nice also!</li>
    <li> Made my hair so much more manageable and easier to comb/style.&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks awesome and it shines!</li>
</ol>
