      <li>and I was pleased.</li>
      <li>( I have more than 300 now ) polishes, then you need to keep track of the colors by using some sort of nail wheels or sticks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Much more durable then those flimsy plastic ones I had before.  </li>
      <li>Glad to read that nailpolish remover works well on the nails.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, totally awesome wheels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered another set! :)</li>
      <li>they get cracks but other than that they worked perfectly like i hope</li>
      <li>organized my polishes by brand and these made it super easy to find the color I wanted to paint my nails with!</li>
      <li>look great, and I was happy that they also allow me to try out new and fun designs without having to douse my fingers in polish remover every time I want to try out a new idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was color swatching all of my nail polishes and these worked great for that because it allowed me to see which of my polishes were on the more sheer side at a glance.</li>
      <li>These nail wheels are a great way for me to, not only keep track of all the colors I have, but have a better idea of what they look like when applied.</li>
      <li>These make it easy to see what my colors look like on the nail before I put it on.  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t buy this again any more , cheap cheap cheap.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I was looking for in order to have \\&quot;samples\\&quot; of my own polishes.  </li>
      <li>I bought these to get accurate swatch wheels for my nail polish collection and to practice nail art.</li>
      <li>If you need something cheap to put nail polish on to catalog your collection, here you have it.</li>
      <li>I am happy with them overall</li>
      <li>Already filled two, just can&#x27;t use polish remover on them.</li>
      <li>Nice to see colors on the wheel sometimes before on your own nails because some look different.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t live without these any more!</li>
      <li>I bought these really excited</li>
      <li>but this product is still great to use to archive your designs long as you have a place to store them in besides the plastic baggy</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, nail polish remover doesn&#x27;t clean off these wheels as well as it should and creates a permanent stain on the nail.</li>
      <li>but once I saw the clear ones I fell in love!</li>
      <li>I got these in clear and I absolutely love them!</li>
      <li>1 full percentage is 2 nails.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These fit the bill just right.</li>
      <li>I successfully created a label that can go in the center of these wheels.</li>
      <li>Overall I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>I love my new display wheels.  </li>
      <li>Fun to use for like a craft for bday party.</li>
      <li>I use it for gel polish that requires LED lamp curing, the oval shape doesn&#x27;t fit most at-home lamps, so only the skinny side can be used.</li>
      <li>and not only does she do her own designs but</li>
      <li>think that for the money, they are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
      <li>The clear makes it easy to get true nail polish colors.</li>
      <li>Came right on time even though they were sent from out of the country.</li>
      <li>They make choosing a color for a mani easy, and let you test new polishes when you don&#x27;t feel like doing a mani right then.</li>
      <li>These are pretty, but they&#x27;re not as nice as the white ones.  </li>
      <li>Made from cheap plastic and imperfection is highly visible after applying polish.</li>
      <li>The polish shows up in its true color and goes on very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
      <li>have bought these wheels several times and overall, great quality was seen.</li>
      <li>I like the clear nails because to my way of thinking it shows better how opaque a polish really is.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I finally needed more</li>
      <li>I have put several gel top coats over these and they get matte soon after.</li>
      <li>The only thing that I would suggest to make this product better, would be to have some type of paper labeling system for each nail color on the wheel so that I could write the name of the color used on each nail.</li>
      <li>I got it more than a week earlier than I was supposed to.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for to display nail wraps/art.</li>
      <li>Would buy more of these in the future.</li>
      <li>If anyone is interested, please go to: 4onlineshoppers</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are very inexpensive and you get many wheels for a low price.</li>
      <li>did lose my head one night, though, and tried to take polish off of one nail with acetone nail polish remover, and pretty much ruined the one nail as the acetone melted the plastic.</li>
      <li>The wheel serves its purpose, but I would prefer if the nails weren&#x27;t so unnaturally large.</li>
      <li>came from Asia and even though they took a while to arrive, the Sellers packed them very well</li>
      <li>And, for the price, it&#x27;s reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Will absolutely by them again</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much easier than using dollar store nails and gluing them onto something.</li>
      <li>paints evenly and very well.</li>
      <li>and after a while you forget about some colors, so I thought this would be a good way to organize and distinguish different shades of polish from each other (like reds).</li>
      <li>My Ideal creation would be for a white plastic center with the clear nails but that would be two different plastics coming together to create something that would probably end up breaking, so, labels it is.</li>
      <li>I feel that you use more polish than with the smaller white ones.  </li>
      <li>Guess I was just lucky enough that they were all on one of the wheels instead of one here and one there.</li>
      <li>I was about to use them just now and found that they are way flimsier than my older ones that I had before.</li>
      <li>Super Simple Stuff.</li>
      <li>They are more of an oval shape rather than the round shape they look like in the photo.</li>
      <li>Shipping broke a nail or a few on many of the wheels</li>
      <li>Since I use only to showcase the colors of what ever brand that wheel has on it, I am ok with not even 1% of the nail count being damaged... which in a single package</li>

    <li> Just like the picture. I usually order the white nail wheels but once I saw the clear ones I fell in love! I plan on using them to do different kinds of tips and 3D art placements along with the typical nail art of course. Came with 10 wheels like it says and it arrived way sooner than the estimated time.</li>
    <li> They would of been good, but some were cracked.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Perfectly clear and had material. Love them. Will absolutely by them again if needed.&lt;br /&gt;None came broken or badly scratched.</li>
    <li> These were perfect for testing all my polishes! Great seller! I Will for sure buy more if I run out!&lt;br /&gt;I organized my polishes by brand and these made it super easy to find the color I wanted to paint my nails with!</li>
    <li> Made from cheap plastic and imperfection is highly visible after applying polish. I use it for gel polish that requires LED lamp curing, the oval shape doesn&#x27;t fit most at-home lamps, so only the skinny side can be used. This item was shipped from Hong Kong and it took almost 2 months to arrive.</li>
    <li> I purchased the clear nail plates, and they have been just perfect for swatching my polish collection.&lt;br /&gt;They look great, and I was happy that they also allow me to try out new and fun designs without having to douse my fingers in polish remover every time I want to try out a new idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up, if you use nail polish remover on these, the plastic will cloud up and get scratched, but I just won&#x27;t do that again.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this.  and not only does she do her own designs but her friends and sister get to make designs too. Fun to use for like a craft for bday party.</li>
    <li> i liked this product and it worked wel but it is easily broken an d they get cracks but other than that they worked perfectly like i hope</li>
    <li> I got these in clear and I absolutely love them! The polish shows up in its true color and goes on very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars bc two nails were broken off when I received them. I had to superglue them back on. Other than that, totally awesome wheels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered another set! :)</li>
    <li> I bought these to get accurate swatch wheels for my nail polish collection and to practice nail art. They came promptly and in quality packaging. A few wheels had extra plastic at the end of some nail tips, but that was to be expected. As for swatching, these do perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, nail polish remover doesn&#x27;t clean off these wheels as well as it should and creates a permanent stain on the nail. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to people who plan on reusing them with different colors on the same nail.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t mad about the nail that came off because there are 199 other nails! I got it more than a week earlier than I was supposed to. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I just ordered another pack of 10 of these since out of my original 20 I&#x27;m down to my last blank (I organize by brand though) and I can&#x27;t live without these any more! They make choosing a color for a mani easy, and let you test new polishes when you don&#x27;t feel like doing a mani right then. Shipping was prompt and everything went perfectly. Can&#x27;t recommend these enough for polish fans.</li>
    <li> I love these! There are 10 wheels with 20 nail tips each. Will deffinately purchase over and over! Nice to see colors on the wheel sometimes before on your own nails because some look different.</li>
    <li> These CLEAR nail wheels are just as described in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;They are very inexpensive and you get many wheels for a low price. A good deal!&lt;br /&gt;I think that for the money, they are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Mine came from Asia and even though they took a while to arrive, the Sellers packed them very well and I was pleased.</li>
    <li> I love my new display wheels.  They are perfect and very easy to handle.  I can do a lot of practice nails with this as well as for display.</li>
    <li> As my nail polish collection grew, it got harder and harder to remember all the colors I had without having to spread out all the bottles on my coffee table. These nail wheels are a great way for me to, not only keep track of all the colors I have, but have a better idea of what they look like when applied. It also helps me keep track of the nail art designs I can do, and experiment with other designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did lose my head one night, though, and tried to take polish off of one nail with acetone nail polish remover, and pretty much ruined the one nail as the acetone melted the plastic. Just a silly thing, but if you do ever get around to filling all the wheels and want to change some out, make sure to get non-acetone remover. But honestly, they&#x27;re cheap enough to just get new ones if anything goes wrong.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for to display nail wraps/art.</li>
    <li> These are pretty, but they&#x27;re not as nice as the white ones.  The nails are longer than I expected them to be.  I also do not like that it is difficult to paint the bottom where your cuticle would be.  I feel that you use more polish than with the smaller white ones.  Everything looks so sheer when you use these.  I would not buy them again but I think they&#x27;re okay.</li>
    <li> I bought these about 2 years ago from this seller and loved them. I finally needed more so I bought 2 of these packages and finally got them in a few days ago. I was about to use them just now and found that they are way flimsier than my older ones that I had before. I feel like these might not hold up nearly as well as my others did. I will use them, but if I ever need these again I won&#x27;t be buying from here.</li>
    <li> The wheel serves its purpose, but I would prefer if the nails weren&#x27;t so unnaturally large. Half of the wheels came broken and/or cracked and unable to use. Otherwise, good product for the money!</li>
    <li> Just like it says, circular disks with plastic nails attached. I got the clear ones. They are shaped like nails, and the nail polish that I swatched out on them has stayed on so far. If you need something cheap to put nail polish on to catalog your collection, here you have it. Super Simple Stuff.</li>
    <li> great place to put my designs. paints evenly and very well. holds the designs and varnish and everything. only thing is is that its hard to find a place with or make a stand for. if the packaging was also a proper storing place id give it 5 stars but this product is still great to use to archive your designs long as you have a place to store them in besides the plastic baggy it came in.</li>
    <li> Much more durable then those flimsy plastic ones I had before.  They are very close together making it difficult to paint.  Also for some reason they will not stay shiney. I have put several gel top coats over these and they get matte soon after. It&#x27;s a weird chemical reaction I guess. It gets the job done so can&#x27;t beat the durability for the price!</li>
    <li> These are a big fat piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these to practice on.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for in order to have \\&quot;samples\\&quot; of my own polishes.  These make it easy to see what my colors look like on the nail before I put it on.  The only thing that I would suggest to make this product better, would be to have some type of paper labeling system for each nail color on the wheel so that I could write the name of the color used on each nail.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to have found these for a great price on amazon. Great customer service. Came right on time even though they were sent from out of the country. Awesome for me to swatch all of my polishes so I know what all I have. This is great for color organization so you won&#x27;t purchase the same colors over.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  The product said it would take about a month to arrive but it got to my house in about a week.</li>
    <li> This item is as described and is a quality product.  I would buy again.  Slow shipping, but for the price, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice polish stand for the price; room behind for extra bottles to be stored; sturdy, and fits nicely on a small table top.</li>
    <li> Product came a month before it was supposed to. Estimation was the end of Feb after placing order on the 9th of Jan. Just got them on the 23rd! Very fast shipping. Already filled two, just can&#x27;t use polish remover on them. Mistakes are permanent smh otherwise very good</li>
    <li> I bought these for practicing nail art designs with Gelish and acrylic paint. I am SUPER happy with the purchase. The nail is long and clear as pictured. I have no problem curing it under UV lights, lots of nails to practice on and 10 pallets in the order.</li>
    <li> The wheels were all in good condition, very good quality. I got all clear wheels by picking clear from the drop down menu, not sure why others are having problems with that. I&#x27;ve cataloged all my nail polishes and couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;They also came in the mail very quickly, a definite plus.</li>
    <li> These are perfect to swatch nail polishes and practice nail art! They are also cheaper than you&#x27;ll find them in a beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> If you have over 100 ( I have more than 300 now ) polishes, then you need to keep track of the colors by using some sort of nail wheels or sticks.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to swatch and practice some nail art.&lt;br /&gt;I love them.&lt;br /&gt;Very practical.</li>
    <li> So i ordered the clear set of nail wheels, but I received the natural ones instead. Not a big deal, I was planning on ordering the natural set in  the future, but I was really interested in getting the clear ones to see what they are like. The nail wheel itself is a bit flimsy, since the plastic is thin. Like, if you were to step on it, if you dropped it on the floor, it might crack. Other than that, they fulfill their purpose of nail polish swatch-ing. I have around 70 bottles of polish - and after a while you forget about some colors, so I thought this would be a good way to organize and distinguish different shades of polish from each other (like reds).</li>
    <li> Worked for what I needed them for. I was color swatching all of my nail polishes and these worked great for that because it allowed me to see which of my polishes were on the more sheer side at a glance.</li>
    <li> Just as In my title just what I wanted. Came sooner than expected. The clear makes it easy to get true nail polish colors.</li>
    <li> I ordered these a few weeks ago and was so excited to receive them! Two of the nails were broken but that was easily fixed with a little super glue. I love these to showcase my nail art for the girls to choose from. It&#x27;s so much easier than using dollar store nails and gluing them onto something. These are a must for all nail polish junkies!</li>
    <li> I bought these so I could practice doing nail art before doing it on my hand. These fit the bill just right. They are more of an oval shape rather than the round shape they look like in the photo. Not a big deal but in case someone is looking to have them stored in a round area they are not round. They were delivered ahead of schedule from NY. Overall I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Good to practice nail art on.  Shipping broke a nail or a few on many of the wheels but I just practice with them anyway.  And, for the price, it&#x27;s reasonable.  Glad to read that nailpolish remover works well on the nails.  Really like the clear nail as a white nails wouldn&#x27;t reflect the nail colors well.  Would buy more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> Oh , bad luck me, 10 of 5 it were broken. I won&#x27;t buy this again any more , cheap cheap cheap.</li>
    <li> Good , Came like they appeared on photos</li>
    <li> Great sturdy nail wheels. . arrived on time. . packed well.</li>
    <li> Great Wheels! I like the clear nails because to my way of thinking it shows better how opaque a polish really is. I&#x27;ve ordered some oval labels to put in the center so I can label my wheels for my cataloging system. I also save a couple wheels to use for practicing some new nail art designs. My Ideal creation would be for a white plastic center with the clear nails but that would be two different plastics coming together to create something that would probably end up breaking, so, labels it is. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought these wheels several times and overall, great quality was seen. In my last order I got 4 packages only 1 of the 40 wheels I got had a crack in 1 of the nails on a wheel... I snapped it off and now have one that has 19 rather than 20 nails on it... big whoop, who cares.  Since I use only to showcase the colors of what ever brand that wheel has on it, I am ok with not even 1% of the nail count being damaged... which in a single package 1 full percentage is 2 nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if you are like me and want to organize your polishes with swatch-wheels (I also use binders).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*LABELS* I successfully created a label that can go in the center of these wheels. If anyone is interested, please go to: 4onlineshoppers (dot) blogspot (dot) com so far it is my only post on account the only thing I&#x27;ve had to do thus far, but who knows it might grow. (But if you have to search for it in the site: \\&quot;Clear Nail Wheel Center Labels\\&quot;)</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful way to practice your nail art or to display your nail art in an easy to work with disc.</li>
    <li> Not to bad! I like em!</li>
    <li> I bought these really excited and when I got them I was a little disappointed. They are a lot flimsier than I thought they would be. Three of the nails had broken off of one of the wheels. Guess I was just lucky enough that they were all on one of the wheels instead of one here and one there. There were also quite a number of scratches on the wheels. I am using them to display my Shellac polishes so once the polish is on it and it evens out you cant see it anymore. I dont think i would use them to display any regular polish. They did come a lot faster than I thought they would, so that was a plus. Overall they are what you pay for. I am happy with them overall but I wouldn&#x27;t tell you you have to buy these ones.</li>
    <li> A few of them were broken when they were shipped to me, but other than that I love them and they make for a really nice preview of what the polish will look like.</li>
