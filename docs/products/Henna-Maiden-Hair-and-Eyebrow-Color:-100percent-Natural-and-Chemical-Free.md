      <li>Like I said I LOVE HENNA MAIDEN by Henna King!!</li>
      <li>I purchased this product for my daughter, her hair came out very nice.  </li>
      <li>It looks amazing!</li>
      <li>I just LOVE ♥</li>
      <li>Now I did the henna on top of the blonde/gray roots, and it all blends perfectly!  </li>
      <li>The color turned out perfectly, and my hair looks better than ever.</li>
      <li>love how it makes my hair feel, and a great color too!</li>
      <li>Having a roll of paper towels handy with some already unrolled is great for wiping your ears and face.</li>
      <li>By the way a good kitchen whisk and metal bowl makes the mixing go a lot easier.  </li>
      <li>For years I&#x27;ve been using chemical colors, and I knew that the time had come to let them go for good.  </li>
      <li>and it works GREAT for covering the cap and keeping your head warm which is part of the curing process.  </li>
      <li>loved the packaging...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good for my head, but it&#x27;s not color the root of my hair</li>
      <li>For what it is, it works well and is a good product.  </li>
      <li>I laughed at the people who just add water and complain about the smell, I would like to see their reaction to smelling it when adding vinegar.</li>
      <li>good news--</li>
      <li>Besides the good colors, it adds shine and health to damaged hair.</li>
      <li>Loved conditioning aspect of the henna.</li>
      <li>Henna imparts both color and condition into the hair as it strengthens the outer cuticle of the hair, thus giving the superb shine, which is the unique feature of Henna.</li>

      <li>And, it&#x27;s thicker and in the most beautiful shape than years.  </li>
      <li>Very glad to be wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The hair look very healthy after use it</li>
      <li>I also love the texture!</li>
      <li>because I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>Today I&#x27;ve used Henna Maiden for the first time and I have to say that it&#x27;s awesome</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Color me happy! ;-)</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I´ve used Hena hair coloring before, but I found that Henna King applied a much more pleasant color looking finish.</li>
      <li>I am happy with this product because it is all plant based and free of chemicals.</li>
      <li>Then I showered with warm water, I did not use any shampoo or conditioner, I just rubbed my fingers over the area to work it off in the water.  </li>
      <li>So glad that I learned about henna and that it is really good for your hair.</li>
      <li>The funky smell dissipated too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today after catching a reflection of myself in a mirror, I realized that this is the richest brown/soft auburn color my hair has seen.</li>
      <li>I am absolutely thrilled with the results of this product.  </li>
      <li>Felt like a nice warm mud pack being applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m THRILLED with the outcome of this product.  </li>
      <li>Get your own gloves.  </li>
      <li>but, honestly, part of the problems I am having are my fault.</li>
      <li>It covered my gray hair nicely, and is a beauitfuil color, about one shade darker than my hair.</li>
      <li>This may be a good product for root touch ups, but in my opinion, a person attempting to color longer hair would be better off without this.</li>
      <li>Seems to condition nicely, too.  </li>
      <li>The best thing about henna is that you can really take your time.</li>
      <li>will stick to itself, the more times you henna, the better the results.&lt;br /&gt;Henna smells earthy (and that is the nice way to put it), its mud!</li>
      <li>It gave me the most beautiful, rich color...</li>
      <li>This product perfectly replicates my natural color, and effectively hides my grays.</li>
      <li>After a week of using this product, my hair it is still looking wonderful, and very natural.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Very easy to mix and apply.</li>
      <li>Great color and super easy to use!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the product, however, I&#x27;m having a challenge with my roots colouring RED or COPPER whilst the rest of my hair is dark brown.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong.... I would recommend Henna to anyone, but can&#x27;t ignore that GREYS are a real challenge.</li>
    <li> I love coloring my hair now. It&#x27;s fun and I like the Earthy smell. My hair feels great and I love color. A thousand times better than the typical toxic hair dyes.</li>
    <li> I just used this product following the instructions and all of the advice.  I have dyed my hair for 35 years and the roots are 100% gray. I wanted to continue to color my hair but get way from the chemicals.  Unfortunately, this product in medium brown, turned my roots and scalp carrot orange. At least half of the grays are still gray (even after leaving on for 3 1/2 hours). Which makes my hair a mess. I&#x27;m going to have to dye it with chemicals tomorrow. The product may be perfect for people with few grays.  Not for me, I&#x27;m afraid.  Sad,</li>
    <li> Hard to say how much I love this product.  It is not for everyone- but for me it is perfect.  I have dark brown hair with sprinkled in gray, especially around my face.  I used medium brown henna to color the gray and not change the rest of my hair.  It looks fantastic.  I have golden brown/red highlights instead of gray.  could not be any better.</li>
    <li> The hair look very healthy after use it</li>
    <li> This product perfectly replicates my natural color, and effectively hides my grays. The time it takes to set is not much different from the length of time I used to spend traveling to and sitting in a salon. I love that I do not have to bleach out my lovely locks before coloring them back to their natural dark color. This product is safe, inexpensive, and produces lovely results.</li>
    <li> This henna medium brown hair color works.  It covers grays/whites pretty well.  The color is medium brown, I don&#x27;t really see any red tint to my hair from this.  I did have to leave it on overnight on my already very chemically processed hair.  I have become very allergic to all permanent chemical boxed dyes.  Henna doesn&#x27;t sting, burn or itch.  Use conditioner on your hair right after you rinse.  The hay like smell can be a bit overwhelming while using this.  I added lavender oil to it which helped with the smell.  Henna is quite messy so be prepared. Do section your hair before using the henna, as it will be very difficult to section your hair after you have already applied some of it.  It is kind of heavy and reminds me of putting a messier clay mask on my hair, rather than my face.  Overall, would recommend for people allergic to the chemical dyes or people that are concerned with chemicals.</li>
    <li> My wife mixes this color with the dark brown and reports that it conditions her hair and the color is luxurious but doesn&#x27;t last as long as she&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful and NATURAL way to add/enhance hair color.  Seems to condition nicely, too.  Very pleased with this Henna Maiden product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> My hair is already medium brown, but this added a reddish hint that I love but is not tacky. I would definitely buy this again. it&#x27;s messy but easy to use...</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter, her hair came out very nice.  I am very happy with the Henna Maiden product, I will recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Loved conditioning aspect of the henna. Wasn&#x27;t crazy about the color results</li>
    <li> I am not new to henna, I&#x27;ve used it in the past, and liked it ok, but it didn&#x27;t cover gray.  I saw this product recently that said it did cover gray, so I tried it.  I talked via email to a representative at the company and they mentioned the two step process, but said I might not need it.  Knowing how resistant my roots are, I went ahead w/the 2 step process.  In addition, I followed the directions for adding salt to make it darker AND left it on 3 hours.  What I got is black hair with gray, straw yellow and rust/copper roots.  My hair still smells like tea even though I added essential oil like they said, and have washed it several times trying to get the color out.  So disappointed. This is a major issue, highlights of varying shades in your hair are great, but a few inches at the top of your head in one color and the rest another, looks stupid.  Anyone know how to remove this stuff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some reviewers mentioned adding vinegar, but the company&#x27;s instructions specifically says NOT to, unless you want more red.  I also noticed on the website, in their list of FAQ there&#x27;s a subsection that says Henna for Hair 2.  It says henna will not completely cover gray, but gives it highlights.  I realize that hennaking has henna and indigo, so maybe that&#x27;s why they say it covers gray.  Whatever the case it doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve copied the information below my update from their site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Since I couldn&#x27;t stand black hair w/gray, yellow &amp; copper roots, I did the process again.  Another 3 hours, and this time, it&#x27;s mostly covered.  The roots are still lighter than the rest of the hair, but it does blend better.  Not really satisfied w/that though.  This process took 10 hours, cost $30 and still didn&#x27;t achieve what it promised.  I am wondering if perhaps trying the dark brown on the roots and the rest medium brown would work, but that&#x27;s a big gamble if it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per the HennaKing site:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Henna For Hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Henna comes from a plant of the privet family, and has been known for centuries for its superb hair conditioning and coloring properties. No other substance, whether natural or synthetic, will strengthen the hair and give it shine as effectively as HENNA. The Henna plant is called \\&quot;lawsonia\\&quot;,and is completely natural. Henna imparts both color and condition into the hair as it strengthens the outer cuticle of the hair, thus giving the superb shine, which is the unique feature of Henna. Henna will not completely cover grey but will give it a transparent covering that looks like a highlight! henna powders are easy to apply just mix with water, put onto the hair and let sit for 30 minutes.

    <li> THE SMELL WAS BAD EVEN AFTER WATCHING HAIR LOTS OF TIME.. will not buy again</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I love how my hair feels so healthy. This is the first time I have ever done this so I have to now figure out my perfect color. It was a bit too dark and reddish/copper. ( I did get a lot of compliments though) I usually have a blonde highlight so dramatic for me. I am willing to try it with adding the salt and neutral pack to draw out the red and also try the hair treatment. I am tired of spending a fortune at the hairdressers and walking out unhappy. Love this product. One more thing they&#x27;re customer service is great and very helpful!</li>
    <li> I have been using Henna for about 3 years now and it makes my hair so healthy while covering the grays. I was getting tired of the red hair so I tried this in medium brown. I love the color. It is brown with red high lights in the sun. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I originally gave this 5 stars, because the color looked great and my hair was shiny at first. I have since used it a total of three times over the course of about 3 months and my hair is in the worst condition it has ever been in in my life. I have fine, wavy, dark blonde hair normally that I used to dye dark brown a couple times a year with hair dye from a box. I also would straighten it every other day, so it was a little bit damaged but nothing crazy. Since using the henna my hair has been breaking off like crazy. I pull out handfulls of hair every time I shower. It is about 3 inches shorter than it was a few months ago, but I haven&#x27;t even cut it! Every strand is splitting and/or breaking despite the fact I&#x27;ve been using expensive leave-in moisturizing conditioner every day, sulfate-free shampoo, and no heat products. The color has completely faded out, and I am just left with ruined hair. It has brought me to tears.</li>
    <li> It is itching first 2 days a lot. Its dyeing well previously old chemical color. The reason for itching probably is bacause of dryed the skin and i put olive oil and this help me</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I have very very fine and thin hair thats about chest length. I was really worried because the instructions recommended more that a package for a full head of hair but because my hair is so thin I only needed one. ( Id still recommend getting 2 packs if your hair is past shoulder length and normal thickness, if its past your mid back you may need 3. Try to find the chart of how much you need, its shown on the back of the the package.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this pack compared to buying henna and indigo separately because you can choose the color option that already has the perfect ratio of henna and indigo to give the desired color, rather than guessing because too much indigo &#x3D; black and too much henna &#x3D; red&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going for brown hair and i bought miraculous medium brown for 15.99. This was a drastic change for me because my hair has been chemically processed (to be blonde) a lot before this. I decided to go brown to I can stop worrying about brassy hair. Blonde hair is a lot of work to take care of and I could never keep it the cool ash shade I wanted without constantly putting in chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process is messy and smelly and takes a long time but its so worth it. I mixed the powder with half water and half apple cider vinegar and got right to work Covered my entire head and waited 2 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as your done make sure to wipe off everything before it stains. Wash your hands and ears and forehead and neck after if you see any henna on them. IT WILL STAIN YOUR SKIN if you leave it. I didn&#x27;t wash of my hands and they were green and no matter how much you scrub it wont go, it will also really dry out your hands. Although I used the gloves at first I was having a hard time using them cause they are huge for my hands so near the end I used my bare hands to make sure everything was covered -bad idea. I did this a week ago and there is still a little green in the cracks of my knuckles and my hands are very dry were I leftthe henna. This was of course my fault and won&#x27;t happen to you as long as you wash after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many have complained about the smell. I laughed at the people who just add water and complain about the smell, I would like to see their reaction to smelling it when adding vinegar. Granted, its not a smell most would like in their hair, the smell of the powder itself is an earthy muddy planty smell. Adding vinegar will of course make the smell worse but helps a lot because henna works well with pHs around 5. The smell reminds me of matcha tea powder. If the smell is really that terrible add essential oils to make it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result:&lt;br /&gt;My hair absorbed the color very well, too well actually. It was more of a dark brown, probably because my hair was dry and light to start so it took in the color more. I&#x27;m still happy with it because it covered my brassy hair. I&#x27;m also happy because my hair actually does look thicker. Some people said it dried out there hair but as long as you condition well after you wash it out it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely thrilled with the results of this product.  The color is perfect and my hair is so soft and shiny,.  I will certainly be buying more.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this product and it is Great - I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  My coarse gray hair absorbs the brown coloring and it is a perfect match to my natural color. In addition, Henna is organic - how cool is that, right!?  Beautiful color w/o the chemicals found in other hair coloring products that your body has to tolerate!!  I think my next purchase, in about 5 - 6 weeks, will include the neutral conditioner that I will mix in for a perfect (again) lighter color for Spring/Summer.  TY!!</li>
    <li> I finally had a chunk of time that I could use for the application of the henna.  I have been using chemical hair color for many years so I don&#x27;t know what color may hair really is.  I just know that around the temples the hair is 75% grey.  Because I have seen so many unfortunate henna colorings, I tried it only on my temples where I have the most grey.  I figured that if it comes out badly I can always use regular hair color on top of it.  I followed the instructions and left it on my hair for about 3 hours. I was surprised at the results: nice shiny hair where the henna was applied, but did not entirely cover the grey.  I am planning a full head color next week and I will update this review then.  But so far so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered my third package of Henna Maiden and I LOVE it. I use the medium brown and the color is really pretty. The instructions are simple to follow and I leave it on for about three hours. It does have nature/grassy scent to it but if it bothers you, apparently it&#x27;s OK to add essential oils to the mixture. Color gradually fades after a couple months but it&#x27;s hardly noticible. Only my regrowth is obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see why I&#x27;d ever go back to toxic chemicals in other hair color brands. I&#x27;m really happy I found Henna Maiden on Amazon and would recommend. No problems with packaging nor seller and I would purchase again from them.</li>
    <li> I liked the ease of application, but I don&#x27;t think the coverage was very good, and now only about 3.5 weeks later the color has faded.  That wouldn&#x27;t have happened with the henna I have used before.  I have dark hair with a few greys and I expected a reddish stain on them, but it was weak.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve noticed my sensitivity to the hair dyes used. I&#x27;ve been eyeing this product for a while and just decided to make the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are pretty straight forward. The gloves are useless because the paste sticks to everything. I recommend you use some tight fitting latex gloves or do as I did and use nothing. The result of smearing my hair with swamp paste and looking like a swamp head was entertaining for my seven year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband swore the entire house smelled like a fresh cut alfalfa field. Certainly better than toxic chemical smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few days I wasn&#x27;t sure about the choice I made. The color was nice and my hair smelled funky, but you can&#x27;t use shampoo for 24-48 hours and only conditioner. When I could finally use sulfate free shampoo and rinse out the residue, the color and shine that resulted SURPASSED and dyes used in the past. The funky smell dissipated too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today after catching a reflection of myself in a mirror, I realized that this is the richest brown/soft auburn color my hair has seen. My hair is so soft and my natural curls are responding well, verses past dyes that seemed to dry out my hair and limit the curls. The silver gray coverage was pretty impressive too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep an open mind and give it a chance. I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> I like it after adding the water the mixture is a smooth paste and easy to apply to hair. But still it dose not cover the gray hair completely.</li>
    <li> My hair started shedding like crazy. I do not believe that it does not have some chemicals. It is very depressing to see hair shedding . Do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair is dark brown and I have a lot of grays. It is the first time I used this product after years of dying my hair . I did my roots first (used the brush sold to apply regular dying colors), like I used to with the dying color. and then I applied the rest of the product on the rest of my hair. I used 1/2 of the back. I follow the tip from another user. add 1 teaspoon of vinegar and 1 teaspoon of sweet almond oil. and instead just water I did one bag of tea.&lt;br /&gt;It is true I got a little red, but not too much, and my grays are kind of golden. Everybody&#x27;s hair is different, but at least i did not get any orange color.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not terrible. I left the product on for 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little bit difficult to apply because is not creamy. maybe i will another teaspoon of sweet almond oil next time. and more water.&lt;br /&gt;It did not stained my skin or shower.</li>
    <li> I have been using Henna for hair coloring, (beard and facial gray) for some time now, and the powder is my favorite thing, you have to mix it really thick and then cover w/ plastic and then I use a heating pad on medium for about an hour over the plastic and it does work well, it is great for those of us w/ allergies to the other types of hair dye.</li>
    <li> I have medium/ long hair and I used one package. It worked great, covered my gray for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have medium to long hair and I guess the description for this product online didn&#x27;t clearly state how much product was needed for certain lengths of hair. Upon receiving the package, I found out that it was only enough product for short hair. I decided to try it out anyway and found that it was extremely messy. The strong, earthy smell of henna stayed in my hair for WEEKS after application, in spite of regular washes. This may be a good product for root touch ups, but in my opinion, a person attempting to color longer hair would be better off without this.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair, brown with some gray, mostly at temples.  After using Henna Maiden twice -- the first time with a mix of 3 parts medium brown and one part light brown, the second with only medium brown, I can&#x27;t recommend this product for gray hair.  After keeping the henna pack on for 4 hours, the resulting color was fine, hair soft and in good condition, but gray hairs were still gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed the henna powder with strong camomile tea and a tablespoon of olive oil into a thick paste and had no trouble applying it and the smell isn&#x27;t bad, just very earthy.  You must be careful about the shampoo and conditioner you use or henna will wash out.  I use liquid castile soap for shampoo and L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme conditioner.  Color lasts at least six weeks.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it product. It stopped from lost of my hair. My hair becomes stronger and regrows on my eyes. This product is my rescuer! I order it over and over and use one two times a month to give nourishment and strength to my hair.</li>
    <li> I used this product in my hair and am happy to report that it works! I have hair below my shoulders and I only used half the package. I was going to just cover the roots. I used warm distilled water, 1tsp of red wine vinegar, 1tsp olive oil, some black tea and coffee about 3 tbs.each.  I mixed it to a pancake batter consistency.I applied like the package directed with the plastic gloves provided. I had made to much product,  so I decided to do all my hair. I put the cap on and waited three hrs. The pkg. recommends that 1st time users leave it in for that long. It&#x27; s a little messy when your applying. You put it on heavy. Just cover your neck with an old towel and stand on an old towel. This way you won&#x27;t get it all over the floor.Any product that gets on your forehead and neck washes off with soap and water. Once your time is up just wash out with conditioner only. It feels a little grainy. I combed my hair out with a wide tooth comb.The smell is hard to get used to. It smells like tea.(I might try coconut oil instead of olive oil next time) . It looked great. Since I only used half the package I will be able to get a second and maybe 3rd color out of it , if I only do the roots next time. I waited 4 days before washing my hair.( I don&#x27;t have oily hair). I used only conditioner. I will use shampoo the next time a wash my hair.I can&#x27;t wait to see how long the color will stay in. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE ♥ Henna Maiden Hair Color. It is all natural, covers my grays better than the conventional hair dyes, does NOT give me a headache as the conventional hair dyes did and the color is wonderful. It leaves my hair very soft and full of body. I have curly hair and instead of it being frizzy the Henna tends to help define my curls. Like I said I LOVE HENNA MAIDEN by Henna King!!</li>
    <li> 2.5 hrs and no grey coverage!</li>
    <li> Being vegan and a naturalist I was searching for something that wasn&#x27;t so harsh. When I found this and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I am so glad I purchased this product. Great color and super easy to use!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use doesn&#x27;t have an over powering odor most henna has, washes out fairly easy and when I use it for some reason I don&#x27;t need to shampoo so much. Great product</li>
    <li> Does cover grey after trying everything. It did turn the grey blonde looking but other than that it colored it and that&#x27;s all I cared about</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product because it is all plant based and free of chemicals. the color turned out just the way I wanted it</li>
    <li> It really work your hair looks healthy and shiny. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> it shipped in decent time. loved the packaging... the gloves that came were massively too big LOL had to have my bf tape them to my wrists ha. they were so cheap so my fingers ended up breaking through. thats not a big deal though at least not for me. the product was a first time for me. i was nervous BUT it does work. the color came out a bit redder than the medium brown but not by much and its likely due to having a strawberry blonde chemical base before i started as i have been dying my hair with boxed dyes. the smell lingers for days though, and after having it on your head for three hours youre likely to get a bit of a headache that lingers along with the scent. very earthy. it is quite messy and i had to pull down my shower curtain to clean everything after the first shower. took over a half hour to rinse out. ended up cheating and adding some conditioner as it was tangled and would not rinse from my low back length hair. after i showered i added biosilk because my hair was really too hard to brush out. that made it much easier. my friends have all been asking if i would try this again, on day three shower three wash one, i would say yes. hoping that the next time the color will be richer and stick better, as i think two bags was just not enough to get full coverage. im going to give it one more go at the end of the month and see how i like it then, come back and review it on how well the color holds and how a second dying goes over. thanks.</li>
    <li> I put on my hair for 5 hours, but it did not change my hair color at all.Also, it was very hard to wash out even after days it was still on&lt;br /&gt;my hair.</li>
    <li> It did not work , it was a waste of time and money! i bought 2 of them , and throw the second one.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended, this Henna hair dye is really the answer to my hair problems....... lighting fast delivery :)  thank you very much for your product!</li>
    <li> I was a bit overwhelmed when viewing the different henna dies available. I stumbled upon this product, read the reviews and took the plunge!  I have middle of my back long, thick hair... the package said I&#x27;d need 2-3 packages to cover yet a review from someone with my same hair length said they used half a package. I bought a packaged intending to use half, chickened out at the last moment and has WAY TOO MUCH dye!  LOL!  I added a TBS of vinegar since I have oodles of gray only around my face - the most visible area, right?!? - and some coconut oil for conditioning, then left it for 30 minutes to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; per people&#x27;s instructions.  I made the consistency like regular hair dye and after covering myself and my bathroom in dye (it wiped right off and didn&#x27;t stain anything, not even me!, I wrapped my head in plastic wrap, sat back and watched a football game.  When the game was over I hopped in the shower, rinsed and WOW!!!  FABULOUS color, SILKY hair, AMAZINGLY WONDERFUL!  I have a lot of natural red highlights so mine turned out really auburn with lots of red and a lot of dark brown... a totally *perfect* combination!  I&#x27;ve received compliments left and right and after 3 weeks I&#x27;m just starting to see a tiny line of grow out so I&#x27;ll be enjoying the Super Bowl covered in plastic wrap!  LOL!  ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a henna novice and gave this product it&#x27;s first try today. I had researched a bit of info, since the instructions appeared vague. For many years I&#x27;ve seen a professional colorist to give my medium brown hair with many grays a touch up. I&#x27;ve grown tired of using chemicals and have chosen a cleaner lifestyle. This product seems to fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned that most people use steeped black tea (about a cup) or brewed coffee to mix the henna powder and the salt is necessary to develop the deep rich color. Some add lemon to bring out the red. I chose to skip that step, was not feeling like taking that risk on first application. I mixed the tea in pretty hot and by the time I had the paste ready 1-2min&#x27;s later, it had cooled enough to apply on my head. Felt like a nice warm mud pack being applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it by myself, but the henna dries up and the paste gets difficult to work with after few minutes once it starts cooling down. Pretty quickly needed to ask my husband for help to finish the job. We&#x27;re both not trained in gray root coverage, so we gave it our best shot, but 3h&#x27;s later I did notice we missed some spots. Not bad for a first try. I let the mass sit on my head for 3h&#x27;s used the hair cap and also wrapped my head in plastic wrap and just sat and hung out. One thing I did not miss was that &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; feeling that your scalp starts to develop after having chemical dye on your head for about 25min&#x27;s. Also didn&#x27;t sting the eyes, just felt comfortable. I did go into the sun for a few minutes to get a bit of a redish result, but I think you really have to sit for longer if you wish for a more red glowing tint. Another lesson learned. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves in the box are flimsy, do invest in a good pair of professional hairstylist gloves. Within a few minutes it became a bit messy the gloves wrapping around my fingers and partially coming off. My husband chose to use his hands and ended up soaking his fingers in lemon juice, they arestill partially stained but it will get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3h&#x27;s later I rinsed with water, conditioned using Alba Botanicals coconut conditioner and love the result. The scent of the henna powder is not bad, some folks choose to add essential oils to cover it up. I didn&#x27;t, but might do so next time. It&#x27;s a great product, will try again.</li>
    <li> This henna is just not dying... I waited, and reapplied, and waited again, and after hours of waiting, my eyebrows were just as light as before</li>
    <li> Great result.  Plan to a Henna from now on.</li>
    <li> Great product--good color--would order again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I had a skin sensitivity to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the red wine several times and some how after months of using Henna King I have developed an allergic reaction. Sucks.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had mixed one medium brown with a red wine and the brown did not show up.</li>
    <li> This product was easy to use...it just takes time. 3 hours and if you have greys to cover you have to do the two application process which is no big deal. It can be messy if you are not prepared ahead of time. Have all supplies prepared first. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> What a nightmare- don&#x27;t buy it!  I wanted something chemical free so I thought I would give it a try. Worse decision ever.  It did not cover evenly- just blotches of color like leopard spots. The spots turned greenish blue after a couple of days.  I tried to get it fixed professionally and my hair turned bright blue. Henna cannot be corrected- it has to grow out. Now my hair is 3 shades darker than I wanted and still has the greenish blue tint.  I say pass on this product unless you have used henna before.</li>
    <li> This henna made my hair look fantastic! My hair is permed, dyed and highlighted. After a summer of working in the garden it was bleached, dry and rough. I decided to look for an alternative to dye and highlights. I&#x27;m so glad I found Henna Maiden. I ordered using Amazon prime same day and had the product that evening. Henna Maiden come with the henna, gloves, plastic cap and instructions in the package. I added a teaspoon of salt as suggested in the direction for a deeper color and about a cup and a half of hot water. The one packet of Henna Maiden was more than enough for my neck length, fine hair. I left it on for 3 hours under a heating cap. It took about 15 minutes to rinse out with conditioner. After I dried my hair - WOW! It looked thicker, had a little shine and was much smoother and soft to the touch. The color is slightly darker than I expected and darker than the picture online. It&#x27;s still lovely. Next time, I&#x27;ll forgo the salt or try the light brown.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I am absolutely AMAZED at this product.  I have extremely stubborn gray hairs that are resistant even to chemical hair coloring.  I&#x27;ve used a different henna product before with crummy results, similar to what some of the other reviews of this product claim: poor to negligible coverage of my gray hairs.  I&#x27;ve been using the no-poo method since Thanksgiving and was hoping to find a natural alternative to chemical hair coloring.  I thought after my last experience my &amp;#34;natural alternative&amp;#34; would be wearing my gray loud and proud.  Very glad to be wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me share what I did that worked for my stubborn grays:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Use coffee instead of water.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I added a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and olive oil (one teaspoon each.)  The instructions say that using vinegar will increase the red, as will letting the mixture sit for any length of time prior to applying it.&lt;br /&gt;3.  I placed a turban wrap over the included shower cap and then tied a heating pad to my head over that (I know it sounds ridiculous, however, heat helps the color set.)&lt;br /&gt;4.  I left the color on for FOUR hours.  I wanted to be sure that it would take this time.  The instructions say that every time the color will absorb better (and perhaps faster?)&lt;br /&gt;5.  I rinsed as much out as possible then washed with my baking soda no-poo as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, while I thought it was a little ridiculous that one of the reviewers was complaining about the &amp;#34;one-size fits all gloves,&amp;#34;  after my own experience with the fingers sticking together and to my hair as I tried to coat my strands, and almost coming off with every application...I realize that they were right.  Get your own gloves.  It will save you some aggravation in the long run.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try the product yet. Giving 5 stars to the company to at least providing an alternative to all the chemical laden hair colors out there.</li>
    <li> I love the henna and the way my hair feels - However, It&#x27;s going to take a lot of practice to get this to work because my hair turned WAY TOO RED!  None of the organic hair dyes actually look like the picture on the box or the hair samples.  They say that AMLA power helps and so do walnut shells - so I&#x27;m going to try using those next.</li>
    <li> Dyed my mom&#x27;s hair Medium Brown. She left it on for over 9 hours and the color turned out great! Added some salt to the mixture to help blend her roots with the unnatural black dyed hair that is still growing out. It looks great! The henna has improved her hair tremendously. Photos are posted in the customer images.</li>
    <li> I love this henna and use it every other month. I get amazing complements and my hair is back to what it was when I was 20 years old. FABULOUS and great alternative to harsh chemicals. I highly recommend this product. for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> The color doesn&#x27;t apply easily.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been wanting to use more natural products for skin care and hair care so I did some research and decided to try Henna Maiden. I was a little worried how it will turn out but it turned out better than what I hoped for. It made my hair so full and soft and looking healthier than it has in years. The stray grays I had are now very subtle golden red highlights and the rich brown really shines.  Applying it to the hair is something I will master someday but it is very doable and well worth it!</li>
    <li> great color! i am naturally blonde but prefer a darker rich brown, i wanted to stop using harsh synthetic dyes, so I tried henna Maiden, and i love it! wonderful color i can feel good about using on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I am giving this 5 stars because it works very well and was exactly what I wanted. It covered my gray hair nicely, and is a beauitfuil color, about one shade darker than my hair.The basic instructions are to dump the dye, which is basically a pile of ground up dried leaves, into a glass bowl, add warm water until you get a smooth mixture, then start coating it on your hair. The dye can only color hair that it touches, so you really have to work with it to get all your hair covered.  Then you let it sit for 1.5-3 hours and rinse it off.  You aren&#x27;t supposed to wash it for 24 hours.  The instructions also offer lots of variations to make more customized colors.  Since it was my first time, I stuck with the basic application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say this dye has an earthy smell.  That is true!  It basically smells like you are covering your hair in a rich mud.  It still smelled after I rinsed my hair, and even after I washed it 24 hours later.  It isn&#x27;t a bad smell, but it is strong.  The instructions say you can add essential oils to make a custom scent.  I might try this next time, but I am not sure how it could cover the smell entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also, make sure you order enough dye. My shoulder length hair took 1.5 packages.</li>
    <li> Lasts for 2 - plus months and fades gradually so gray just becomes a lighter color.  Very happy.  Have used it twice&amp; will continue using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using Henna Maiden for 1 year and am totally satisfied with the results.  The color is beautiful and my grey turns a subtle copper shade.  I love it and my hair is so healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m horribly allergic to normal hair dye--even the temporary stuff breaks me out in a rash.  So, I was nervous about trying anything new.  But this works perfectly for my hair.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.  I mix this with wine red (half and half) and get a fabulous color on my normally mousy brown hair.  This henna colors well and the directions sent with the product can help get the right thickness and coverage.</li>
    <li> after 2 weeks my hair keeps on looking shiny and it&#x27;s very soft. I will buy it again... depending on how long color stays on</li>
    <li> I really hate that it takes so long to work, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the color and the fact it isn&#x27;t tested on animals and is chemical free AND you can use a little and save the rest - so now that I am doing roots and edges only, one bag lasts so much longer. and the price is SO reasonable. Super super happy.</li>
    <li> After exploration, I concluded two things. First, apply enough amount, if it is not enough, not matter how long you leave it on, it won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it is not necessary to use tea bag or coffee, warm water works. I applied half package to cover my grey, left on for about 3 hours. It lasts about 4 weeks till I see grey again. It is not bad. My hair does feel shiny after application.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it smells. After regular shower about a week, mine was gone. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I mixed medium brown and light brown. I left it on for more than two hours and mixed in a little vinegar because I was worried it would not be dark enough. Boy was I wrong! It left lots of dark brown color without looking black. When the light hits my hair, the shine is a light brown color. I couldn&#x27;t be happier! If you&#x27;re torn between buying a lighter shade or a darker shade, I recommend buying the lighter and buying the darker one later if it isn&#x27;t sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for people even if they just want to give their hair a healthy boost! When washing the product out, I felt like it was cleaning and restoring it much better than oily conditioners, and my hair has never been so shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons are the intense green tea smell and that it is a bit messy, but a little precaution of adding essential oil to the mixture and utilizing old towels should fix that.</li>
    <li> First time using any henna product.  I have medium brown hair with natural golden highlights.  I have a little bit of gray that shows up on my part and above my ears, so I wanted to cover that.  I hAve been using regular store bought hair dye for this but want to stop using all the chemicals.  This has pretty simple instructions, scent is not too bad.  Smells a heck of a lot better than the regular stuff.  Not too hard to apply.  I thought that it would be easier on the thicker side.  I have long thick hair so I could have used some help.  I left it on for about 1.5 hours.  Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference after rinsing, could still see grays.  After I blow dried it a bit I could see the difference.  It did cover the grays partially.  The healthier part of my hair was a bit lighter, the dryer, a bit darker, but not really noticeable.  Very silky and shiny, only conditioned once.  My skin was super soft and shiny after the product had run down my body.  That was unexpected.  I should have done my roots first and left on for an hour, then the rest for 1.5 hours.  I really appreciated the soothing, clean feeling.  No burning or itching.  No staining the towels or floor.  I gave it 4 because it does work with a little trial and error.  For what it is, it works well and is a good product.  Will use again.</li>
    <li> You better like red. Medium brown is really auburn / red with orange highlights. I was told to reapply it , of which it is now dark auburn /red, In the sunlight it is Bozo orange. Research warned me but I fell for the picture used in the ad of the girl with the brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;The good news-- it covers gray very well.&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is the only cure is sizzors. It won&#x27;t wash out. It cannot be dyed over. I doubt paint thinner would remove it. If your into red/ orange the product is great.</li>
    <li> love how it makes my hair feel, and a great color too! I have to leave it on for 6 hours to get the color i want though.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone who likes Henna as its the best Henna I&#x27;ve ever found.  Besides the good colors, it adds shine and health to damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just completed my first Henna Maiden Medium Brown package following years of self-coloring via standard, commercial coloring kits.  Compared to using the standard, commercial (chemical) coloring kits, I found this Henna Maiden product as easy to mix, as easy to apply and far less dangerous with respect to staining of skin, bathroom, towels, etc.  My hair looks and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to application, I read many prior reviews and application tips.  Following recommendations offered, I used a strong dark tea as the liquid (instead of clear water) when mixing.  I prepared the mix for an evening test strip and then left the balance to set up overnight for a daytime application of my full head.  I left the product on my head, wrapped in plastic wrap and a bath towel, for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find that covering grays took two applications of the henna coloring mix.  The first application turned my gray temples to \\&quot;golden highlights\\&quot; and the second application provided expected color.  A single package of Henna Maiden provided sufficient product for both applications of my shoulder length hair with years of chemical treatment history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found this product a delightful surprise  Far easier and cleaner than expected!  Less mess in my bathroom than created using chemical mixes.  Color me happy! ;-)</li>
    <li> took it for my wife ! its worst.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been quimicaly dyed since I was teenager and now I&#x27;m allergic to it. I&#x27;ve used before the Lush henna, but it left many whites in my hair, and those colored where in red (I always use the brown colour to dye). Today I&#x27;ve used Henna Maiden for the first time and I have to say that it&#x27;s awesome, it coloured all the whites in brown (no reds! yahoo!!) and my hair is really soft and shiny. I followed the instructions and added an egg and some lemon juice to the mix and I have left it in my head for about 4 hours. I definitely will buy it again and I recommend it for henna users.</li>
    <li> I´ve used Hena hair coloring before, but I found that Henna King applied a much more pleasant color looking finish. Plus, very shiny hair.</li>
    <li> Love it and it works well.  Just a mess to apply but for those allergic to chemical hair color it&#x27;s a great alternative.</li>
    <li> Way to messy for me..</li>
    <li> Male, dark brown hair, with about 30% gray on sides, and was starting to gray on top front as well.  I had tried &#x27;Just For Men&#x27; and after 6th use started to have VERY bad reaction so I decided to try something natural like Henna.  I will come back and update this review as I try it out.  See the OVERALL REVIEW at the far bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: I decided as a test to just do sideburns and a quarter size spot on forehead near the hairline.  The powder smells like damp hay on a farm, not manure as some put it.  It is a strong odor.  I first added a teaspoon of salt to the entire mixture to create a bolder color (per directions in box).  I then placed about a tablespoon of the dry mix into a ceramic dish and added hot water from the tap, and mixed it until it was a heavy paste.  The paste is green.  I first applied Vaseline on the skin around my sideburns.  I did this as I thought the Henna might stain my skin green.  I am now ready to apply the dark green paste.  I used reusable rubber gloves also bought on Amazon, I smeared the paste onto my sideburns, rubbing it in and also leaving a thick layer so you couldn&#x27;t really see any hair.  I also applied a tiny amount to the hairline on my forehead.  I then took small pieces of Saran Wrap and placed it over the areas, it stuck well due to the paste and Vaseline.  This will keep it from drying out as directions say it needs to be wet to work.  I then waited exactly 2 hours.  At the end of 2 hours the dark green paste got even darker, I would say it was almost black but when I wiped a bit on a tissue I could see it was very dark green.  Then I showered with warm water, I did not use any shampoo or conditioner, I just rubbed my fingers over the area to work it off in the water.  That was it.  As I dried with my white towel I rubbed it over the areas I dyed but did not see any color on the towel, this surprised me.  To my surprise, my sideburns were completely dark brown, I could not see a SINGLE gray hair.  The chemical dyeI used NEVER EVER dyed my sideburns completely as the hair there is thicker than my other hair.  The color seemed to blend with my natural color, there is no sign of green or red hues.  The spot on my forehead was to small of an area for me to really tell if it did anything, but I am comfortable now that my hair wont turn green or red that I will try my whole head this Friday.  More to come .. so far so good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: Later that week on Friday I did my entire head.  Same process as above, doing my best to cover my head with plastic wrap so it stays moist.  I only had to use about a third of the package which is nice.  After two hours of web browsing, typing, watching TV, and drinking a couple IPA&#x27;s, I rinsed off in the shower.  It does take a while to rinse the product out , I can imagine this being very difficult if you have long hair.  Again while drying my hair with the towel there was no run off or staining on the towel, and again I am surprised as I expected there to be.  The results were almost what I had hoped.  Most of my hair was a deep brown with no signs of gray.  On one side of my head however, down near the roots the hair was orangey .  I am assuming I just did not apply enough product on that side since everywhere else looked pretty good.  When I combed my hair you could not notice the orangey color so I decided to wait until the following week to re-dye that area.  On Thursday night of the following week I re-did the sides and this time added a little more salt to the mix.  I would say it is 80% better, but still some orangey colors on a handful of strands.  It is not detectable when I comb my hair so I will live with it for now.  Next time I will apply the product to that side with my opposite hand, it might just be in my technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Review:&lt;br /&gt;1) Color: It&#x27;s a rich brown color, darker than I thought it would be, but does resemble my natural hair color.  I like it.  It covers ALL the gray so don&#x27;t expect any gray blending, it will be gone.  I only shampooed once since applying and my hair does have a luster that it has never had before.  Seems odd to say this, but the product may work to well and may seem somewhat unnatural in that the color is rich and healthy looking, which perhaps for a 40 year old male is not entirely expected.  But I can get used to it since I still feel like I am 25.&lt;br /&gt;2) Smell: It smells like wet hay on a farm.  Days later when your hair is wet you will still smell it slightly.  The first night after doing my whole head I could smell it as I slept and was not entirely pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;3) Effect on Hair thickness: My hair seems much thicker and is MUCH easier to style.  I really like this effect and did not expect it.&lt;br /&gt;4) Effect on skin on scalp: The sides of my head from prior Chemical dye use was itchy and would flake.  I had a bad reaction to Just for Men and the doctor said it would take a couple months for my skin to return to normal.  But after applying this henna stuff the itching STOPPED.  I read up on it and I guess Henna and some of the other plant ingredients are known for their antiseptic and skin calming effects.</li>
    <li> After many years of paying over $60 per hair color to cover my gray roots(every 4-5 weeks) I tried home coloring systems with little or no chemicals. Pigment products i.e. Bigen work well, but I wanted to try Henna. This product was smelly, messy, and ineffective. The benefit of Henna is that it makes your hair shiny and healthy. The down side is that it does not cover gray hair, which is why I color my hair in the first place. I would not try this product again. In fact, after just a week I had to do a root touch up with the pigment hair color because the Henna did so little. I left the Henna on for over an hour and a half. I feel like that time and the money paid for the product were nothing more than a waste. Not recommended at all.</li>
    <li> This product works GREAT!!! I had to keep it on 9 hours because I was called away from my home for an emergency after I applied the paste.  It gave me the most beautiful, rich color... even the grey!  Thank you.  I am so excited that I never have to use chemicals again.  This product even helped improve the condition of my hair.  I can&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
    <li> I am 54, very gray and have never dyed my hair before.  After a week of using this product, my hair it is still looking wonderful, and very natural.  I have already ordered another package.  It does have an earthy odor, but I only smell it while my hair is wet.  Once it is dry, I do not notice it at all.  It is worth it to know I am not putting harmful chemicals in my hair.  I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> Yes, I know, real Henna is naturally a reddish pigment. I am unsure why I assumed because it said it was &amp;#34;medium brown&amp;#34; that it would be less red...that was false. I have medium brown hair naturally with subtle red undertones, which I adore. I am always trying to  play up the red in my hair. This ,however, gave my hair a rust-like orangish red undertone which was especially prominent in the front where the little wispy hairs are lighter. I know it says it does not lighten your hair, however this did not darken it any either, which just made my light skin tone look especially washed out and pasty. I got some compliments, really just because they asked if I changed my hair and felt obligated after I said yes to say it looked good. The honest people in my life agreed that I needed to do a color wash and darken it up, which I did, and I am much happier with my color.&lt;br /&gt;  So, if you really like a good amount of red in your hair go for it. If you want medium brown with hints of auburn, try another option.</li>
    <li> I used the Medium Brown on healthy, virgin hair.  My natural color is the same as the image on the package with about 10% gray.  The first application turned my grays a carrot orange color.  I didn&#x27;t notice any color change on the rest of my hair.  I used conditioner to help get the mud out, but I didn&#x27;t shampoo.  The next day, I did a second application.  This time I added a little salt to the mix to get a darker result, as indicated in the instructions.  This made the grays an auburn color, very close to my natural medium brown color.  My hair is so soft and shiny, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the final color.  It&#x27;s my understanding that the henna in the package attaches to the protein in the hair shaft the first time (but the indigo doesn&#x27;t) which is why the grays came out looking orange.  The second time around, the darker indigo in the mixture attaches to the henna that has already attached to the hair shaft resulting in the beautiful brown color that is shown on the package.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product, but I will only use it to touch up my roots because I&#x27;m very pleased with the current color and don&#x27;t want it to get any darker due to layers and layers of indigo buildup.  If you get orange hair, don&#x27;t be scared off.  Just do the application again to get the beautiful brown color you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Cassia on the full length of my hair monthly for a very soft, shiny result.</li>
    <li> super purchase. Tried it to cover some gray hair on the taut and despite the fact that I didn&#x27;t leave it for the full time required but half of it t covered all the grey. I&#x27;m so please as I can do it myself at home and it&#x27;s totally natural. A very good product! I&#x27;ll buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I researched using henna as hair dye for months because I had bleached my hair 9 months ago and severely damaged it, thus unable to use chemical dyes. I have salt and pepper roots and med. brown, chemically dyed hair. Well, after watching videos, reading reviews, and blogs, I decided that this would be my best choice. WRONG!  I mixed the henna powder with black tea, as some suggested, added a little salt to darken, added a little olive oil, and a little vinegar. The smell was horrendous. I prefer natural, earthy scents but this was almost overbearing. But that was ok...the henna left  my hair a beautiful, rich dark chocolate iridescent brown. I was in love with the color. The funky smell did not wash out.  I rinsed my hair with sulfate-free herbal essence conditioner (the only brand I&#x27;ve found that keeps my damaged hair from feeling like straw) and all the grittiness came out...but the smell did not. I did not wash my hair for 48 hours fearing the color would fade. It did not leave my hair shiny AT ALL. It was/is actually more dull than before. After washing my hair for the first time after coloring it,  IT WAS/IS HORRIBLE!! I honestly did not think the condition of my hair could get any worse than after bleaching and frying it. I was so wrong. My hair was starting to heal after the bleach job (after tons of homemade treatments) and now it&#x27;s way worse than before. I can&#x27;t brush through it, I have to leave conditioner in my hair constantly, the amount of breakage is nuts!!! and it&#x27;s dull. It&#x27;s horrible. I&#x27;ve NEVER had hair this bad. And the only good thing that came out of this experience (the amazingly beautiful color) has faded to a hideous orangey, brassy, reddish, gross color after just TWO WASHINGS, just over a week! Also, I forgot to mention, it not only didn&#x27;t cover the gray, but it didn&#x27;t even phase the light brown roots that haven&#x27;t turned white. IM CONSIDERING SHAVING MY HEAD AND WEARING A WIG. ITS THAT BAD. I kept reading about those who&#x27;ve had awesome experiences with this stuff but honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth trying, if you&#x27;re considering it, because of the chance your hair will turn out like mine! MY HAIR IS OFFICIALLY RUINED. My only other option for hair coloring now, is black walnut hulls. Then I give up.</li>
    <li> I previously used Rainbow Henna, but found it left my hair with orange tones. I tried using coffee and still had orange tones. I decided to try this product since it included indigo with natural herbs.  I followed the directions and wore cap provided. After, 2 1/2 hours, I was PLEASANTLY surprised that my natural brown appeared with the silky look. It covered my grey and the orange tones.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product to friends and family.  Henna Maiden offers an array of colors and is a safe alternative to chemical hair dyes!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite go to hair color!  It is chemical-free, toxin-free and colors my grey better than all of the commercial brands.  I will never go back to chemical hair colors.  This hair color leaves my hair shiny and healthier!  I highly recommend it!  The photos are after each of my last 3 colorings.  Notice that the longer you leave the color on your hair, the more intense the color will be (first 2 photos).  The longer you leave the color on, the darker the stain will be.  The last photo is about a month after the last coloring, when I was due for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;(Well the pix reordered after going live...Lol... but I think it&#x27;s obvious which are which.)</li>
    <li> So far I have used this product twice and I love it. It makes my hair so vibrant and shiny. The plus side is that it isn&#x27;t damaging my hair (more like conditioning like it) and it last for sometime. I plan to use it at the end of every month to keep up the color and the shine. Another great advantage is that it fades. So you can not tell the difference when your hair grows out and you can use it as often as you want. The only thing that is a downside to this product is the smell. I use tea infused water and essential oils when mixing it with the product. It seems to mask some of the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t take away the smell completely. However, the smell only lasts for a day. No big deal.</li>
    <li> It came with the instructions on how to mix it, I did it and my hair was so soft and cover my grays so perfect! loved it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past few months.  It takes some getting used to and haven&#x27;t mastered the perfect combination of vinegar and/or salt yet.  I am happy that I am not putting harmful chemicals on my hair/scalp.  My hair feels softer and shinier and I get compliments about it often.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use - just follow simple directions. The smoother the paste the easier it is to rinse out (with conditioner). The longer left on the better. I&#x27;ve left in for 4 hours with better results than 2 1/2. Still have to repeat every two weeks but I only use 1/2 package.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. The results look very natural and my hair is shiny and soft. It covered the grey as well as any other over the counter product. I left the mixture in my hair for 2 hours and while it looked green, the color came out as promised. I did the medium brown and will try the auburn next time. My hair is about chin length and very fine, so I only used half of the package and that seemed plenty.&lt;br /&gt;Hurray for not having chemicals in my hair and most of all having a product that is not tested on animals!!</li>
    <li> My hair is shiny and I have received many compliments on it.  My friends thought I had it done by a professional.&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to chemicals, dimethicone, in permanent hair color.  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the carrier didn&#x27;t deliver it.  It caused a problem for me on my schedule.</li>
    <li> Super shiny results! A bit messy so applied product outside</li>
    <li> Its good but my white hair still showing</li>
    <li> I used this Henna treatment and it not only did it color my hair in a natural dark brown, but it also gave it great texture and bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definetly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I made a mistake and bought the medium instead of the dark brown to mix with auburn and cover grey. I have tried the light brown in the same ratio for the mix, on the same person, left it on just as long, and it produced far better results than this medium brown. It just does not seem to grab onto the hair. Fantastic picture shown with the product listing, though, don&#x27;t you think? :)</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I want to give this a bad review but, honestly, part of the problems I am having are my fault. But not all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have thick and long, waist-length hair. 2 packages Almost covered it but I had empty spots so I&#x27;d have to get 3 packs and pay almost $60! That&#x27;s when this gets expensive!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it, cleaned up everything easily and kept it in 6 hours. My neck was in serious pain because a ton of hair + 2 packs of &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; is SO SO heavy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took forever to wash out and for months afterward, the color would still be washing out in the shower and all over my towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I hated most was that my hair turned green way after applying it. Like months later?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I did not know that henna can not be changed nor taken out, only grown out. Right now I feel trapped and I can&#x27;t wear my hair down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m THRILLED with the outcome of this product.  For years I&#x27;ve been using chemical colors, and I knew that the time had come to let them go for good.  That said, I wasn&#x27;t ready to go gray (by now I&#x27;m probably salt n pepper).  So I went to my stylist and had an overall lightening...blonde highlights on my brunette hair.  This set the stage to move into the natural color, as the blonde has blended with the grays as it has grown.  Now I did the henna on top of the blonde/gray roots, and it all blends perfectly!  The henna leaves highlights and shimmer where the blonde/gray was, while coloring all the hair with a brilliant, shiny medium/dark brown.  It&#x27;s EXACTLY what I was looking for, and I placed an order for months&#x27; supply (never going back!).  A few pointers given to me by a local expert:  I used half the packet for my medium length hair.  I also used tea (rather than water) just to boost the color.  Add a teaspoon of vinegar (I used red wine vinegar) to help the color take hold.  Add another teaspoon of oil (I used apricot; olive is fine as well) to help with the conditioning. Then re-mix and add more hot water to create a runnier mix -- more like regular hair color.  Apply to your hair (it&#x27;s not easy breezy, but just scoop it up and rub into scalp &amp; hair).  Place plastic over head and wait 1 1/2 hours....then heat up with a dryer for five minutes (or sit in the sun).  Rinsing is messy...I did it in the shower.  Condition VERY WELL to help get the rest of the henna out.  The outcome is simply....GORGEOUS!  YAY!</li>
    <li> I used this product and I&#x27;m not to pleased. I&#x27;ve used better. My hair now has a weird Oder. Why?? I don&#x27;t know. It never had a weird Oder before. I&#x27;m a clean person, so, I can only guess it&#x27;s from this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sitting here with a head full of henna. This is my second time using it and I hope it turns out as well as it did the first time because it was amazing. Like so many others, I&#x27;d suddenly developed an allergy to regular hair color so this is a lifesaver! But about that kit. The gloves are a joke. They split immediately and they&#x27;re so big, they slide off and the mixture gets down inside. Do yourself a favor and buy a box of gloves at the grocery store or Home Depot. Also, a pack of cheap plastic tarps is useful to spread over your vanity and bathroom floor (they&#x27;ve huge so just cut some off). Having a roll of paper towels handy with some already unrolled is great for wiping your ears and face. That&#x27;s my two cents! The best thing about henna is that you can really take your time. No pressure!</li>
    <li> I am not pleased with the product. It did not cover my gray. I dyed it once and then the following week hoping it would the second time and it did not. It turned yellow on top of the gray, but not the medium brown I purchased.</li>
    <li> I am glad to see my previously highlighted dark hair back to a shiny bright color..even though the color intensity disappears after a couple of weeks, the hair still feels and looks healthy and shiny. I love it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect chemical rinse alternative for my transition to &amp;#34;truly&amp;#34; natural hair. Moisturizing hair color! I love it! It&#x27;s easy to apply and last longer than a rinse (@6-7weeks, my hair grows quickly).</li>
    <li> There are many things to know about Henna...first things first though, I use Henna Kings&#x27;s products, as does my twin sister (I am Mahagony, and my sister uses Red Wine).  We both love it. In terms of henna, it is about as basic as it gets, comes in a nice foil pouch with gloves, cap, and instructions (follow them, or hit the Henna Fourms and find your own solution if you have a specialized problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Henna is permanent, though the color does fade, as do metallic dyes which are artificial and toxic.&lt;br /&gt;Henna lays on the shaft (not in it), so this is different than metallic dyes which again are toxic.&lt;br /&gt;Henna will stick to itself, the more times you henna, the better the results.&lt;br /&gt;Henna smells earthy (and that is the nice way to put it), its mud! DO purchase either patchouli or lavender pure essential oils and use them generously in your mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My formula:&lt;br /&gt;I always use a dollop of yogart and 2 teaspoons of grapeseed oil in my henna, and I mix w/ near boiling oil and add gradually as I stir (not on my head, in the bowl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let it sit just a couple of minutes and then apply, wrap w/ a hair cap, or platic shopping bag, and then wrap my head in a towel. My henna stays in for about two hours (max).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinse with a small amount of shampoo first, then add a handful of conditioner to my hand, lather that up with the remaining henna and rinse for like 10 minutes, if it feels gritty I rinse again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about bleach after henna? - Well it has been done with varied results, Google the Henna forum with that question, I may try it this summer, if I do I will post pictures, and I will strand test first! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about henna over bleach. - Well, I had completely fried my hair with bleach, multiple processes over bob length hair. I have now used henna about four times, and you can&#x27;t tell my hair was ever bleached; with the exception of the strand I left without henna (I pull it out every time, its a chunky strand, so its easy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My finally recommendation? If you are going to do it, use Henna King, remember any acid you use will make it more orange-red, you henna will oxidize (as do all colors) when it does it will also get more red. If you have any questions about not wanting to have red and you are a brunette w/ dark hair go for the Mahanoy it is nearly black. If you like the funky wine color that is so popular use Wine Red, my sister does and it is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid read up and remember that once you Henna, it is a commitment, but its only hair! If you don&#x27;t like it, chop it, or use a temporary dye over; it is likely however you won&#x27;t be able to go back to a lighter color easily. - Though the henna will fade. :)</li>
    <li> I had tried henna color once before and really didnt like the smell or the results, but I thought maybe it was just the brand I had used before.  Lately I have resorted to henna for pregnancy reasons.  I bought this one and applied using some lemon juice for scent.  By the way a good kitchen whisk and metal bowl makes the mixing go a lot easier.  I left it on about 2 hours.  It took a good 15 minutes to completely get it all out in the shower and do condition at least 2 times after.  I got out and it looked like it didn&#x27;t cover much of my grey.  After I blow dried it I noticed he color coming in a little more and some grey had changed.  It has been 2 weeks now and unfortunately my greys have grown out or reappeared.  I do have to say it has left my hair, that I have chemically colored for almost 20 years now, a lot more healthy and soft.  I really have not noticed any split ends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three or four times now-- because I LOVE it! It feels great on the scalp and makes my hair so shiny! I also love the texture! It takes some getting used to -- it&#x27;s sorta muddy -- but it doesn&#x27;t run or get everywhere. Plus-- it&#x27;s natural. No harsh chemicals. You can&#x27;t lose.</li>
    <li> It worked but 3 hours is to long in my&lt;br /&gt;case an its a little to red.</li>
    <li> I did not use the hair color  because the  mixing and application seem to be extremely complicated...the directions and mixing seemed beyond what I was willing to do.  I also found out that you cannot have highlights applied after using this product because your hair will break off.</li>
    <li> Very fast deivery, but I don&#x27;t like the result of the product. I&#x27;m feel frustrated the color not match with the picture, and my grey color now is orange.</li>
    <li> it works. Its really hard to describe but if you don&#x27;t follow the instructions, you can definitely end up with a very custom color. It can go either way, really!  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair and so the portions was very off. I had a lot of product left over after my coloring session. you&#x27;ll definitely need measuring tools.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting a powder and it did not give appropriate results even after 3 hours of application. It took almost 2 weeks to teach by mail!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the worst shopping I did! I am not satisfied and I don&#x27;t know what I should do, since it seems I cannot return it! I applied it twice, each 30 and 45 min and I still have my black eyebrows! It simply isn&#x27;t working! can you believe? Don&#x27;t buy this product and use the chemical ones!</li>
    <li> OK, this takes much longer than the hair color I&#x27;ve used for years, however, it&#x27;s worth waiting two hours for it to take. You can tell the difference when coloring without chemicals: Your hair doesn&#x27;t dry out; it stays shiny. and it lasts for weeks -- albeit as with all of the hair dyes I&#x27;ve used, the gray doesn&#x27;t stay colored until your next scheduled coloring. That said, because there are no chemicals, I had no problem in applying a touch-up half way through my next coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While dark brown is too dark for me, I do like my hair a little darker than the medium brown, so I ordered the dark brown. When it arrives, I plan to add a little of the dark powder to the medium brown powder I already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people like me with thin, baby-fine hair that really suffers from chemical dyes, it&#x27;s the best option. All in all, I now plan to keep using chemical-free hair coloring, and would recommend others try it. After all, you have nothing to lose but the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/25/13: Got the dark brown, and mixed it with the medium brown (1 part dark to 3 parts medium). The color turned out perfectly, and my hair looks better than ever. The color is a darkish brown, but not too dark. This time I left the color on for nearly three hours while working on my computer, so will see if it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I love not putting chemicals in my hair.  I have a few grays...not so many that I would have to professionally dye my hair, so this product is perfect!  It covers my few grays to appear like lighter highlights.  The color lasts for about 8 weeks.  my hair is medium to dark brown naturally and I buy medium brown Henna Maiden.  I will use this product over and over.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Smell was not too bad of a problem after I used the suggestion to add a few drops of essential oil. My hair feels great after two uses. I notice it is stronger with more shine. I get many compliments.</li>
    <li> As the title says, I&#x27;m all new to this! I&#x27;ve gotten highlights in high school, first time was odd and I had to tell them I wanted streaks from then on. For a total of 3 times. Then I wanted to go blonde, I have medium brown hair, store bought box dye well it turned gold, yeah not pretty and then I had to wait and went for dark brown, which turned my hair black inside and red out in the sunlight. That was the last time I ever colored my hair with box dye!! So when I started getting white hairs at 22/23 yrs old I plucked them, then I found out, not a good idea, so I would color them with mascera when going out. I kept finding more of them and I got natural highlights from white hairs, so I wanted to go medium to dark brown. I really didn&#x27;t want to go to a salon because of cost and it can dry out your hair. So glad that I learned about henna and that it is really good for your hair. Well I did my hair color with this and the light brown, I forgot to mark them and so I got more in of one color then the other, I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s light brown, I will mark them for now on. I really like it, and for doing it myself, not so bad. I watched a lot of youtube videos on henna, and I found two that I&#x27;m trying out on applying, the first was to pile it on the head, well it was a mess and I still smell spinach in the shower, the next time april 3rd I&#x27;ll do it in four sections with all the hair down when I&#x27;m done. They said it smells like hay, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting spinach to me. I&#x27;m really glad I started out with lighter, like they say you can&#x27;t go lighter but you can always go darker. So I&#x27;m working my way towards a little darker then my natural color.</li>
    <li> So, it&#x27;s like a mud mask for your hair. It smells like some kinda mud and feels like a mud mask. It gives your hair that rusty nail color. It also makes your hair shiny. I don&#x27;t like the fact that it stains your scalp orange for a few days and that you need to keep it on for 5 hours. The first application isn&#x27;t dependable so a second application is needed for an even color. That&#x27;s 2 nights of sleeping with mud in your hair, not fun. My scalp was a little irritated from this product. It will dry out your hair if you don&#x27;t mix in a Tbsp of olive oil. I don&#x27;t know if I like it, seems like a lot of work to keep it maintained. The only positive is that it&#x27;s chemical free and it makes your hair shiny.</li>
    <li> Left my hair soft and like the color. Also like the fact that you just add water, mix and apply without having to mix with something else of wait some hours to apply it.</li>
    <li> Used this product for the first time. Very easy to mix and apply. Color a bit darker than I anticipated, but this is day 3 and the color is settling in. I love the way my hair feels and shines.</li>
    <li> The henna is really one of the better ones, but I still won&#x27;t buy again. I bought this color several times, always with initially nice outcomes. Yet, the color won&#x27;t stay on as long as other henna&#x27;s that are equally nice and cheaper. I did like this specific brown tone though, which is why I initially bought again. But you won&#x27;t have much color left after 2-3 weeks if you wash every second day.&lt;br /&gt;So my recommendation: go with the henna guys instead.</li>
    <li> I love what this product does to my hair. I have been using an ammonia free product that doesn&#x27;t last long and leave my hair feeling course and a bit frizzy. I have natural curly hair so keeping it manageable is important to me..&lt;br /&gt;I have not used this that long ago so I can not say how long it will last.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this because she wanted a more natural hair dye. It looks amazing! The color lasts a really long time and it doesn&#x27;t have all the terrible chemicals. We will use this product forever!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good for my head, but it&#x27;s not color the root of my hair</li>
    <li> I mixed this henna and let it sit for about 12 hours to let the color develop.  I mixed it with dark tea, sweet almond oil, and a little bit of apple cider vinegar.  I applied it to a section of my hair and let it sit for 3 hours.  I applied it to a section where I have a lot of gray action.  After I washed it out, it didn&#x27;t seem to cover the gray at all.  I really wanted to like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do what I need it to do; blend my gray hairs.  I will update my review after I do a few more experiences with the product.</li>
    <li> Recently, I developed an allergy to hair dye.  I&#x27;m 44, so have a lot of gray, and need to color my hair.  I have no idea why it suddenly happened, but, I was getting burned and scabs in my scalp and it was really scary, so I wanted to find something more natural(and it didn&#x27;t matter what I used, even stuff from Whole Foods, it must be the PPD chemical in them all).  Anyway, I first went to the indian salon and had them do it the first 2 times so I could learn, then I decided I could probably do this myself.  YES, this is messy, but, not more so than regular dye. This is my 4th application (my hair needs to be done every 3 1/2 weeks) or you see a skunk stripe.  I LOVE THIS!  I tried Auburn before, but, it turns your hair like RED I mean, the color red.  No.  I used brown tonight and it&#x27;s great.  I completely covers your gray.  And some people say it doesn&#x27;t.  Yes, it does.  You need to put the vinegar in and you have to let this sit and stir it a few times for at least a half hour.  That part is critical.  I have gotten pretty good at this for being a newbie.  You can watch youtube, but really, you can just mush it into sections of your hair and you&#x27;ll be fine.  If you get the consistency right, it&#x27;s very easy to do.  I went to Sally and bought the cotton tubing you wrap in around your face to prevent drips and I know this is crazy, but I happened to have the Turbo Twist I ordered years ago and never used from those infomercials and it works GREAT for covering the cap and keeping your head warm which is part of the curing process.  Expect that your hair, 2 weeks in, will look awesome.  I get all kinds of compliments on my hair.  And, it&#x27;s thicker and in the most beautiful shape than years.  And my grays are 100% covered, in fact, I think it&#x27;s better than when I dyed.  Looks way more natural and so much more healthy.  I am so grateful I found this.  Plus, you can do it over and over the same day if you don&#x27;t like it, with no harm!  Another thing - I don&#x27;t wash my hairevery day, as I don&#x27;t have oily hair, and that really helps it to stay and cure onto your hair.  You can also be in the sun without covering your hair as it actually likes the sun.  I will be trying this on vacation next week to see that first hand.  Normally you&#x27;d have to take your hat along for FL.  Also, you need to use shampoo without SLS (sodium laurel sulfate) that will strip the hair of this.  And another little tip.  If you&#x27;re not keen on the fresh cut flower stem smell of this, add a few drops of your favorite essential oil, which really helps with that.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell though, but I do add lavendar and a little jojoba oil for softness.  Please ladies, do your research before you do this, but I can not be more thrilled.  I will NEVER dye my hair with convential (bad for you) dye again.  Indian people have been using this for hundreds of years for a reason - because it works.</li>
    <li> For the last few years I use only natural hair dyes. This time I wanted to try 100% henna. Fist of all, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. I put the henna on my hair for a night and woke up in the middle of the night nauseated. The smell is terrible and doesn&#x27;t go away by washing the hair out for one time.&lt;br /&gt;Secondary, it didn&#x27;t cover my gray hair, which is a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;The only positive thing I can say is the hair felt and looked healthy and shinier afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to my [[ASIN:B00014HDT6 Herbatint Permanent Herbal Haircolour Gel, with Aloe Vera, 4N, Chestnut, 4.56-Ounce]]that I love and covers 100% of grey hair.</li>
