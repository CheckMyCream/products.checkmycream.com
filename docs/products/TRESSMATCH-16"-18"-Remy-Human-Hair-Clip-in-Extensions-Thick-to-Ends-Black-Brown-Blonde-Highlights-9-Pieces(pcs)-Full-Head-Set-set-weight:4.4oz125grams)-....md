      <li>The clips are comfortable and lightweight.  </li>
      <li>But I guess that&#x27;s what you get for buying cheap extentions.</li>
      <li>i opened this up and knew right away, this is authentic Remy quality hair.</li>
      <li>Right now, I am completely satisfied and would recommend these without hesitation.</li>
      <li>The true test will be to see if they split easily and how the silkiness holds up.</li>

      <li>but it was worth it.</li>
      <li>Hair extensions are worth the money..</li>
      <li>But reviews on other products of the seller are good, so I tried.</li>
      <li>Yeah, I would say the product is exactly as described–smooth, soft and easy to curl.</li>
      <li>being a stylist and wearing non-remy hair really teaches you the difference.&lt;br /&gt;the clips look very strong and secure, more resistant to slipping than regular wig clips.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was wanting</li>
      <li>Came exactly as described and exactly as the picture is shown.</li>
      <li>I had them put in at the salon the first time</li>
      <li>As for my daughter, now she wants to use mine all the time!</li>
      <li>they are my first extensions Ive wore ever.</li>
      <li>Way better than euronext or any sallys brand and cheaper than any remy human hair on the market.</li>
      <li>given the higher price.</li>
      <li>I will know better next time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> AMAZING. Perfect match and looks natural.</li>
    <li> love! matches my very dark brown hair perfectly.VERY LITTLE shedding. brushes &amp; straightens no prob. would say high 90 percentile real. good value for set/pcs purchased. will buy more for sure.</li>
    <li> Extremely pleased with this product! Easy to put in my hair. Looks very natural as well. Definitely love my extension!</li>
    <li> Really not impressed with these extensions. My friend got better ones for $30. They are poor quality. They tangle so easily. Develope split ends like its no ones buisness. But I guess that&#x27;s what you get for buying cheap extentions. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to someone else or think about repurchaseing.</li>
    <li> First I must say, that the quality is excellent. But the color is extremely inaccurate. I ordered the chocolate brown, and the color is more an auburn, red/brown. I&#x27;m terribly disappointed. I wish I would have read the enclosed card, because I was excited and tore the package right open :/  Also the length was off, I ordered the 16-18 and they were only 15/16 inches :(</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews. I work 50-60 hrs/week and have kids. No time. But.....I felt I needed to take the time to finally write a review about these extensions.  I&#x27;ve purchased these a couple of times within the past two years, among other brands. And these are the best. The clips are comfortable and lightweight.  The hair blends very well and people are shocked once I tell them they are extensions.  The hair is of great quality and I prefer these to any other brand. I recently purchased a new set from another company (L..y) and I paid close to $200, guessing the hair would be even better given the higher price. It was a waste of money and I completely regret it. I will never again purchase any other hair extension brand besides Tressmatch.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> not much hair and is not full head, I&#x27;m not satisfied, good quality but pedi 18 &amp;#34;and I get 16&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t come 10 pc</li>
    <li> Good hair no knotting..</li>
    <li> i opened this up and knew right away, this is authentic Remy quality hair. the way it slips, it&#x27;s absolutely silken. being a stylist and wearing non-remy hair really teaches you the difference.&lt;br /&gt;the clips look very strong and secure, more resistant to slipping than regular wig clips. and the wefts look like they are doubled up for superior coverage-- if you&#x27;ve worn extensions, you know the paun of stringy lengths.&lt;br /&gt;MY ONE AND ONLY HANG UP which isn&#x27;t strong enough to take off any stars: Tressmach seems to provide only a selection of neutral-colored hair. if you have warm or ashen hair you WILL have to color!&lt;br /&gt;my suggestion as a beauty professional would be to pick your hair by level (lightness or darkness) and ask your stylist about using a demi-permanent color. it is more gentle than 10 volume and can deposit on-level. if you are DIY-savvy i believe ion at Sally makes a demi line.</li>
    <li> Awsome hair, great price! I colored them, curled them, washed them, straightened them just like my own hair! Love these extentsions!! Very natural looking</li>
    <li> These look and feel REALLY straggly  at the ends. I ordered these because of the high rating and the Bellami extensions I really wanted were sold out.  I wish I had waited and spent an additional $40 for a quality product, as it kinda feels I flushed $90 down the tube. I did give stars because the hair does seem MOSTLY human and does not tangle too much. I will not be purchasing again, let alone the another pack as suggested in other reviews. To do so might equal the weight in a Bellami product, but at an additional $60 if you do the math.</li>
    <li> very good grade of hair extension, nice and heavy, full, looked great combined with my fine hair. I would highly reccomend!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair to begin with and these extensions added more volume.  Yes, they are made of real hair and blend in with mine perfectly.  They&#x27;re easy to clip in and take out.  No tangles and easy to store.  I wore these for several weeks and nobody suspected lol!  The trick is to get a color closest to your own hair color.  I also bought extensions that were longer and they too are wonderful.  Packaging was great and arrived on time.  I would recommend this brand as well as the seller.</li>
    <li> I have bought A LOT of different clip in extension brands in my life. I have spent anywhere from $20 to $300 on them and from my experience, I give these 5 stars for the simple fact of quality for price. Are there better/fuller ones out there, yes, but they&#x27;re $300. I love the small clips and the quality of hair these provide. I have very thick hair so I had to buy two packs but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> The clips are huge and the hair is really thin, horrible quality. I guess you pay that price and it is what it is, really not what i was expecting.</li>
    <li> Overall these extensions aren&#x27;t bad.  I ordered these and a different brand in dark brown to mix colors.  At 120 grams, if you have thick hair like I do you WILL need 2 sets.  I&#x27;m growing my hair out and one side is longer than the other so I really needed 2 sets.  With just the one my hair in the back showed through.  Compared to the dark brown set I ordered (different brand and only 70 grams) these are much nicer and don&#x27;t thin out as much towards the bottom.  I think trimming the bottoms will help with the thinning that is there.</li>
    <li> I have lost a bit of hair during infusion treatments. I was hesitant on purchasing anything like this as I am not one to fuss over my hair.  My daughter thought I could not use this or &amp;#34;pull it off&amp;#34; as she puts it.  WELL SUPRISE!!!! It looks great! The color was perfect.They are so easy to use and blend well into my hair with little to no effort. As for my daughter, now she wants to use mine all the time!</li>
    <li> the hairs very stringy like when ur hair is damaged from dying it too much where it turns stretchy like. i hate these extensions. the color was lighter than what i requested.</li>
    <li> These are my first set of extensions, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much. I had them put in at the salon the first time so I could learn the best technique. The stylist there thought I&#x27;d paid $300 for them! She couldn&#x27;t believe the quality for the money. She did think there are some synthetic hairs mixed in, but was able to curl and blend these into my hair beautifully. I wore them to a rooftop party and there was an insane wind of about 20mph with higher gusts and not only did the extensions stay on- they ended up looking quite nice with a little windswept action! I washed and conditioned them before using as recommended. Best $75 I&#x27;ve spent on my hair! Great for those special occasions when you want longer or fuller hair.</li>
    <li> they won&#x27;t stay in my hair</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wedding.  The only thing I regret is that I didn&#x27;t get longer ones! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just purchased my 3rd set of tressmatch extensions. I have two 22inch sets and one 16. I have dyed, styled and washed them and they still look great. I would definitely recommend these extensions!!</li>
    <li> The hair extensions are amazing! They easily clip in and wash with a gentle shampoo/conditioner well. They look extremely natural and the color is perfect to my own hair color. I love the brand Remy and am a loyal customer now.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality hair! It matches my hair color perfectly. These extensions blend excellently with my shoulder length hair and look natural. They don&#x27;t shed and are nice and thick - not scraggly at all. Would recommend and will buy again!</li>
    <li> There basically like any other extensions thin and in a few days they get tangled and isn&#x27;t a full head</li>
    <li> This matched my hair color perfectly it was easy to maintain. I washed it, hung it to dry and reused it several times without any problem. I would definitely suggest this product to anyone was looking for easier maintainable weave.</li>
    <li> Thought it was a decent product because it says REAL HUMAN HAIR but the package I got obviously is not. Cant be dyed or bleached and when I touched it with my straightener it sizzled up some. Waste of money since it cant be returned. I will know better next time.</li>
    <li> I did NOT like the quality of this product. It had some long, stringy glue pieces attached. I really wanted to LOVE it, BUT I did NOT.</li>
    <li> I loveee this extensions. I can really say this are the best even tho they are my first extensions Ive wore ever. I recommend this to everyone. They were going to come on time but the snowstorm gave it a one day delay. My hair looks bomb in this extensions. Im more than glad I choose to but these ones :) and they are pretty long too so thats a plus. Im a happy customer and I will deff. buy again &amp;#60;3 :)</li>
    <li> When I&#x27;ve received I&#x27;ve loved them.   They were so soft.  After one wash Ive noticed some hair falling out; keep in mind I treat my extensions as I treat my hair!  After second wash they became tangled.    I used to purchase my extensions at Sally&#x27;s and I will continue doing that since they&#x27;re only 114-130$ and you get a lot of volume.    These extensions are still soft and still manageable to curl or straighten but the ends look thin and I&#x27;m just tired of brushing it non stop.  That&#x27;s what makes it fall out more but I have to or else it looks tangled..</li>
    <li> Hair extensions are worth the money.. If you take good care of them you can get 8-12months wear out of them!</li>
    <li> Love them! Buying them for a second time.  They are great quality and looks very natural.  The color matched my hair perfectly.</li>
    <li> Soft and shiny although more like 14&amp;#34;, not 16&amp;#34; and definitely not 18&amp;#34;. My hair is thin so I had no problem with the thickness. I&#x27;ve washed them and styled them multiple times with no problems. I wear them a few days at a time without removing them and shower and shampoo them as my own hair. I blow dry them straight or air dry them for tousled waves. My only complaint is the length being at least 2&amp;#34; to 4&amp;#34; shorter than they were supposed to be at the longest point in back.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described and exactly as the picture is shown. Beautiful soft long extensions that are thick from top to bottom. IF you have thick hair i recommend buying an add on set sold here on amazon by happy pretty. They are 70 grams and will give you with your tressmatch combined a 190g set. Both are remy human hair. Dont know why anyone gave these less than 5 stars. Way better than euronext or any sallys brand and cheaper than any remy human hair on the market. Also there are no short pieces in the hair that skimp you out. I have tried euronext, satin strands, design lengths, sassy brand, vienna, ebay, minihouse8888 and many other non name brand and these are the BEST for the price. Deffinite buy and I will be a regular customer!!</li>
    <li> I did so much searching to find decent not so expensive hair extensions and I came across these.  And well I decided to go on a limb. I knew I was going to have to color them with my hair being an odd color.  The day I got them they felt and looked great. I had to color them twice to match my hair and they still looked great. For the price I paid I have no complaints.  There was next to no shedding. I&#x27;m so glad I bought these. I recommend these to anyone!</li>
    <li> Good extensions for the price.  Human hair.  Clips a little cheap and hurt my head after a couple hours.  I bought the 16-18&amp;#34; length and they&#x27;re definitely more on the shorter end.  Next time I would&#x27;ve bought the 20-22&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality of hair. It comes with PLENTY of hair for me, and I have very thick hair. I posted a picture here so everyone can see. On the left, I&#x27;m not wearing them, but I am on the right. The hair is very smooth and a great color. It is also very lightweight, so it does not cause any discomfort. The clips are also excellent and do not move at all. I would definitely recommend this over any other clip ins, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I was a little bit nervous when placing the order because there’s no product review here. But reviews on other products of the seller are good, so I tried. Yeah, I would say the product is exactly as described–smooth, soft and easy to curl. The color matches my hair as well. So I am happy to leave my feedback here and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Really does not look or feel like human hair...It also has a really unpleasant odor :(</li>
    <li> Very nice extensions for the price. The chocolate brown color matched my hair perfectly. They clip in easily and stay in well.</li>
    <li> I like it and the product arrived in my home at time</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was wanting</li>
    <li> Great quality!  Super thick.  Actually matched my hair color perfect without having to color the extensions.  It was a fluke I&#x27;m sure but still!  The only thing is that they smell a little funny, like chemicals.  I assume it&#x27;s from the coloring and cleaning process.  Follow the instructions and shampoo and condition them, let them air out, and in a few days the smell subsides.  I clipped them in and it look just like my own hair.  Would definitely buy from again!</li>
    <li> These came to me across county in 2 days by USPS. I have been buying similar Remy hair with the same amount of wefts and length for $250 for years! I lost my hair camping (true story) and thought I&#x27;d give these&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;cheapy wefts&#x27; a try for a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superb quality out of the box! Terrific feel, quality sewing onto the clips and good quality clips themselves. I CANNOT BELIEVE THESE ARE FOR SALE FOR 72 CLAMS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes they smell a little chemically, but most do when new. The true test will be to see if they split easily and how the silkiness holds up. Right now, I am completely satisfied and would recommend these without hesitation.</li>
