      <li>don&#x27;t like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;it does prevent you from sticking, but its own smell is not that</li>
      <li>The best part about this version of the Crystal brand deoderants is that my husband likes it better than just the solid salt stick--the scent helps him smell great all day.</li>
      <li>This is the best natural deodorant I have found.</li>
      <li>This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, although my absolute favorite is the Cobalt Sky, but this (Onyx Storm is also excellent) 1.</li>
      <li>The smell is OK.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t describe this as a body spray, because it&#x27;s more than that</li>
      <li>Love the scent</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll be tossing the sprays as soon as I find a better replacement.</li>
      <li>The scent was a bit stronger and more distinctive  </li>
      <li>However, if you are in between showers, you can spray more on and it &amp;#34;takes</li>
      <li>I use the solid rock crystal (no scent) and that works best for me since I don&#x27;t have any hair under my arms.</li>
      <li>2nd best is Onyx Storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
      <li>but it would probably be okay for the girls as well.  </li>
      <li>one was the unanimous favorite in smell and all day protection.</li>
      <li>My first take on this was the Cobalt Sky scent which I loved.  </li>
      <li>Not horrible when first spraying on (which is kind of foamy)</li>
      <li>I give this spray on deodorant a five-star rating because it has ZERO cancer-causing agents (like aluminum: The primary ingredient used in most antiperspirants is aluminum.</li>
      <li>To be fair, it was very sticky on my underarms throughout the day and the sticky feeling wore off on my chest.</li>
      <li>This new line of spray deodorants was anything but a pleasant experience.</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best deodorant on the market.</li>
      <li>I used to use Mitchum every day and this is by far the most amazing deodorant I&#x27;ve used aside from Mitchum.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I was searching for a more cost effective natural deodorant.  </li>
      <li>The ones that worked best - Thai Stone and Kiss My Face Liquid Rock - are a bit messy and / or need reapplications throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Still, it was cheap and works as intended.</li>
      <li>Of all the natural deodorants this one by far works the best.</li>
      <li>all potassium alum is, is mineral salts, which are natural and good for the body.</li>
      <li>Maybe if they stuck to more basic scents like in there other product lines, which are excellent and effective.</li>
      <li>Be aware this is not an aerosol, but more of a pump.</li>
      <li>Switching to these natural deodorants is the best thing we&#x27;ve done this year for our health, ESPECIALLY since they WORK!!!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell sweet like some others I can&#x27;t stand.</li>
      <li>The full chemical name of potassium alum is potassium aluminum sulfate, a NEUROTOXIN.</li>
      <li>Even after a full day of camping, I know it&#x27;s still working.  </li>
      <li>Works great, has a unique scent, is allegedly safer than deodorants that use aluminum chlorohydrate (which is the main reason I decided to give it a try).</li>
      <li>Cobalt sky is the more masculine smell in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I like rock because it will keep you fresh 24 hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of reminiscent of cedar and spice.</li>
      <li>It works as good as the other products avoiding the side effects of the aluminum products.</li>
      <li>Great Scent, No more aluminum needed</li>
      <li>Both cobalt sky and onyx smell good, granite smells like black licorice.</li>
      <li>The Onyx Storm scent is pretty neutral....</li>
      <li>This is the third scent I have tried and it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
      <li>It is exactly as he described.</li>
      <li>This stuff is STELLAR.</li>
      <li>My first can lasted well over a year.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast this came!</li>
      <li>The scents are an issue for me, they smell kind of peppery, which I&#x27;m not a fan of.</li>
      <li>I got granite rain the first time and now have onyx storm.</li>
      <li>To start, I love the original liquid Crystal Rock deodorant and there commitment to removing harsh chemicals from products.</li>
      <li>The deodorant itself works pretty well, but don&#x27;t expect it to hold up to intense sweating.</li>
      <li>By the end of the day I still smell decent, my pit skin can still breathe and no weird pit stains on my clothes.  </li>
      <li>This stuff, while it doesn&#x27;t control perspiration, really controls odor.  </li>
      <li>I really did not care for the smell of it.</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>It really sticks with you.  </li>
      <li>Also thanks to Howard for mentioning this product.</li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t a fan of this scent.</li>
      <li>As much as I don&#x27;t want to make this reference, it reminds me of bug spray.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Gillette, Right Guard, Old Spice, and some of the others out there.  </li>
      <li>Maybe the other scents are better than this one.</li>
      <li>The opinion of the smell will be entirely up to personal preference, but if you like subtle but pleasant fragrances (as opposed to the Axe body spray line, which makes you smell like 12 teenage boys after gym class, all at once, imo) then you love this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really unfortunate, because I liked this just fine.</li>
      <li>Crystal Rock Deodorant Spray is the very first vegan deodorant that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin AND actually lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Nice to be able to wash under my arms without that horrible aluminum stuff (in most antiperspirants) that doesn&#x27;t wash off or come off your hands if you touch it.  </li>
      <li>It will foam up, don&#x27;t be alarmed this is normal.  </li>
      <li>Since going vegan five years or so ago, I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find a new deodorant.  </li>
      <li>This not only is an effective deodorant without all the harsh chemicals, but they also don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
      <li>It is very masculine and smells almost cologne or EDT-like.  </li>
      <li>I am so impress and surprised!</li>
      <li>Take your personal feelings aside about Howard and know that he is very health conscious and a germ-a-phobe.  </li>
      <li>I am not a heavy sweater</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper here on Amazon than in the local stores.</li>
      <li>For some that may seem like too much hassle, but I simply brush my teeth while it dries and problem solved.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s works for the whole day, and the next day (for me).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well for my husband who is allergic to the alluminum in regular deodorant</li>
    <li> Smell is too strong and the product was delivered to me in a horrible condition.. Liquids were leaked all over!</li>
    <li> Does and excellent job/</li>
    <li> The container leaks badly.Paint comes off from the bottle when you hold it. I bought two and both doesn&#x27;t spray after a week of use. Stay away....</li>
    <li> Item is as shown and arrived in good working order. Got this for deodorizing the bathroom from funky smells. Was disappointed to see a pump spray instead of aerosol. The scent is a little musky and old-man-ish but not gross. Doesn&#x27;t smell sweet like some others I can&#x27;t stand. Still, it was cheap and works as intended.</li>
    <li> I got this to use at the gym and I like it but it is not any miracle spray by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would probably buy it again for just general use but not for heavy sweating like workouts.</li>
    <li> I use the deodorant roll on of this brand and have no issues! This seems to leak everywhere but my body when i try to spray it on. Be aware this is not an aerosol, but more of a pump. The smell is OK. Maybe the other scents are better than this one.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t a fan of this scent. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it had a metallic smell which didn&#x27;t  appeal to me. The deodorant itself works pretty well, but don&#x27;t expect it to hold up to intense sweating. Some of the bottles also come with faulty pumps.</li>
    <li> Works great, has a unique scent, is allegedly safer than deodorants that use aluminum chlorohydrate (which is the main reason I decided to give it a try). It is a bit pricier than other deodorants, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> That Stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> I give this spray on deodorant a five-star rating because it has ZERO cancer-causing agents (like aluminum: The primary ingredient used in most antiperspirants is aluminum. Aluminum is a metal, which is used in antiperspirants to help block the sweat from escaping the pores. Aluminum has been linked to breast cancer in women and has also been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Also, NO aluminum zirconium, aluminum chlorohydrate, parabens, phthalates, or dyes!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Learn more: [...] AND the Crystal brand deodorants really work as long as you apply them properly and let your skin fully dry before putting clothes on.&lt;br /&gt;***Do not mistake the \\&quot;Potassium Alum\\&quot; as a bad ingredient--all potassium alum is, is mineral salts, which are natural and good for the body. A post I saw earlier mentioned that these still contain Aluminum&gt;&gt;that is FALSE!!! Do your research!&lt;br /&gt;The container is NOT aerosol, it is just a pump-spray system--basically you can travel with it on planes and it does not pollute the air. The best part about this version of the Crystal brand deoderants is that my husband likes it better than just the solid salt stick--the scent helps him smell great all day. I use the solid rock crystal (no scent) and that works best for me since I don&#x27;t have any hair under my arms. Switching to these natural deodorants is the best thing we&#x27;ve done this year for our health, ESPECIALLY since they WORK!!! Yay!</li>
    <li> Smells good, I like the cobalt sky better. Both cobalt sky and onyx smell good, granite smells like black licorice. Cobalt sky is the more masculine smell in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was searching for a more cost effective natural deodorant.  I heard Howard Stern loved it.  Take your personal feelings aside about Howard and know that he is very health conscious and a germ-a-phobe.  This stuff works !  By the end of the day I still smell decent, my pit skin can still breathe and no weird pit stains on my clothes.  The only reason why I took a star off is because after you apply two spritzes to each pit you must wave your arms a few times like a chicken to spread the product.  It will foam up, don&#x27;t be alarmed this is normal.  Then let it dry completely (2-3 minutes).  For some that may seem like too much hassle, but I simply brush my teeth while it dries and problem solved.</li>
    <li> Good thing the bottle was in a plastic bag because some of it leaked out. I really did not care for the smell of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 and weigh about 200lbs. I&#x27;m in shape, sweat about average, work indoors, and am athletic. I&#x27;ve been using Onyx Storm and Granite Rain for at least a year. It generally gets the job done. I would say I notice my own BO rare-to-never when using it. It does a good job with perspiration too. The scents are an issue for me, they smell kind of peppery, which I&#x27;m not a fan of. Not horrible when first spraying on (which is kind of foamy) but at the end of the day I notice my shirts have an awful after-odor, which I don&#x27;t notice while wearing it, only when I take off the shirt. I haven&#x27;t had any complaints but I&#x27;ll be tossing the sprays as soon as I find a better replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought a few different &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants and have the young men in our family test them.&lt;br /&gt;This one was the unanimous favorite in smell and all day protection.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast this came! Love the scent and it&#x27;s the only natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This not only is an effective deodorant without all the harsh chemicals, but they also don&#x27;t test on animals. This is rare and difficult to find for this type of product. The opinion of the smell will be entirely up to personal preference, but if you like subtle but pleasant fragrances (as opposed to the Axe body spray line, which makes you smell like 12 teenage boys after gym class, all at once, imo) then you love this. It&#x27;s kind of reminiscent of cedar and spice. I haven&#x27;t tried the other fragrances. It&#x27;s much cheaper here on Amazon than in the local stores.</li>
    <li> great bargain.  thanks.</li>
    <li> it works, we dropped the &amp;#34;aluminum&amp;#34; based deodorant and moved to this one. It works as good as the other products avoiding the side effects of the aluminum products.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;it does prevent you from sticking, but its own smell is not that great.&lt;br /&gt;although another person might like it.</li>
    <li> Great Scent, No more aluminum needed</li>
    <li> This is the second can of this deodorant that I have purchased.  My first take on this was the Cobalt Sky scent which I loved.  It is very masculine and smells almost cologne or EDT-like.  It really sticks with you.  This can is far more subtle in scent and definitely works.  This would be a great scent for summer time or for those that wear sleeveless tanks and muscle shirts.  The scent will not compete with your cologne or EDT but will still do its job.  Overall, great product with excellent results.</li>
    <li> It does the job.  I like it because I have been using a big name gel deodorant stick for years and since they recently changed the ingredients  the same brand that I have been using gives me a rash.  I have been using Crystal Rock for a couple months and am very happy.  The Onyx Storm scent is pretty neutral.... I am a guy and it works for me but it would probably be okay for the girls as well.  Oh yeah...Also thanks to Howard for mentioning this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is STELLAR. It actually works and can keep up with me. Infact I sprayed some on after Herban Cowboy failed me mid way through the day and the funk was gone.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Just don&#x27;t expect it to last as long as the artificial crap. However, if you are in between showers, you can spray more on and it &amp;#34;takes the edge off&amp;#34; if you know what I mean.</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 cans, and everyone malfunctioned</li>
    <li> Smells like insect repellent. Some if the black paint rubs off. Spray pump works sometimes.</li>
    <li> Works great gave used it for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have found. I am not a heavy sweater so a don&#x27;t tend to need an antiperspirant and this keeps the odor in check just about any time except heavy work days (I am a mechanic). I am not sold on any of the scents offered but this is the best of the bunch in my opinion. It has the muskiest scent, the others are too &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; for my taste.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the positive Amazon reviews, only to find that the few negative reviews were entirely spot on correct. To start, I love the original liquid Crystal Rock deodorant and there commitment to removing harsh chemicals from products. This new line of spray deodorants was anything but a pleasant experience. The Onyx Storm smells terrible in my opinion. It has a Shea Butter and coconut scent to it, not what I was expecting for packaging that appeared to be directed to a guy. As much as I don&#x27;t want to make this reference, it reminds me of bug spray. The first spray of the product produced a foam from where the sprayer connects and made a runny mess. After putting it on my underarms and chest, it became sticky and made for a miserable day wearing it. To be fair, it was very sticky on my underarms throughout the day and the sticky feeling wore off on my chest. I like the idea of this product, but the current formula completely missed the mark. I will continue buying other Crystal Rock products, but test this one before buying. Maybe if they stuck to more basic scents like in there other product lines, which are excellent and effective. These scents are maybe too complex to mix with a salt solution. Something just is not working between the smell and \\&quot;stick\\&quot; issue.</li>
    <li> I like rock because it will keep you fresh 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after hearing Howard Stern rave about it on Sirius. It is exactly as he described. It&#x27;s works for the whole day, and the next day (for me). It&#x27;s the best deodorant I can remember using. The smell of both the versions I purchased are great. I am so impress and surprised! You won&#x27;t be disappointed (even if you HATE Howard Stern!)</li>
    <li> Since going vegan five years or so ago, I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find a new deodorant.  A lot of them seem to irritate my underarms, especially after shaving.  The ones that worked best - Thai Stone and Kiss My Face Liquid Rock - are a bit messy and / or need reapplications throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Crystal Rock Deodorant Spray is the very first vegan deodorant that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin AND actually lasts all day.  I love it.  The scent was a bit stronger and more distinctive  / unique than I&#x27;m used to, but it does fade relatively quickly to a subtle level.  I&#x27;m subscribing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * Update * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bumping this down to a four star review, because the last several bottles I&#x27;ve had stop being usable long before it&#x27;s out of liquid.  The spray pump stops working, and even trying to wash it off doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  So I&#x27;m literally just buying half a product.  This has happened with enough bottles that I&#x27;m just going to stop buying them.  It&#x27;s really unfortunate, because I liked this just fine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t describe this as a body spray, because it&#x27;s more than that it let&#x27;s you sweat, but keeps you smelling great for, I&#x27;ve found, up to 48 hours. This is my second can. My first can lasted well over a year. I got granite rain the first time and now have onyx storm. I like both. I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> This product works and smells great, but it contains potassium alum. The full chemical name of potassium alum is potassium aluminum sulfate, a NEUROTOXIN.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell that good. It leaves a sticky residue on you.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best deodorant on the market. I&#x27;ve tried Gillette, Right Guard, Old Spice, and some of the others out there.  This stuff, while it doesn&#x27;t control perspiration, really controls odor.  Even after a full day of camping, I know it&#x27;s still working.  Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, on an average day it will last up to 48 hours..</li>
    <li> I too was recommended this product by Howard Stern. Let me tell you I used to use Mitchum every day and this is by far the most amazing deodorant I&#x27;ve used aside from Mitchum. It keeps me smelling zero (and I sweat a lot) and the scents of the of the deodorant are great. This one and granite rain are the only two scents ill use. Definitely try it.</li>
    <li> I like Howard but God awful. You will see these reviews go downhill from here. this is really bad.  Smells like cat urine. Plus the sprayer leaks.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I have ever owned.  I usually need about 8 pumps (4-6 hardly seems adequate). Love the smell, although my absolute favorite is the Cobalt Sky, but this (Onyx Storm is also excellent) 1. Best smell Cobalt Sky, 2nd best is Onyx Storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still has aluminum in it - but probably 100 times less than the typical antiperspirant on the market.  Nice to be able to wash under my arms without that horrible aluminum stuff (in most antiperspirants) that doesn&#x27;t wash off or come off your hands if you touch it.  No kidding, if you touch it the next day in the shower it is still there and it takes 3-4 hand washings to get it to come off.</li>
    <li> We purchased this body spray because all of the harmful chemicals in the products on the shelves. However, we never liked any of the other natural products as they didn&#x27;t work. This product does work.  My husband&#x27;s work is very physical and he uses this and he loves it. My son is just getting to the age of needing deodarant and he has chemical allergies. This is perfect for him too. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Of all the natural deodorants this one by far works the best. The only issue I have with the product is that because it is salt based on really hot days I will get a little bit of a rash at application location.</li>
    <li> This is the third scent I have tried and it&#x27;s my favorite. It is very subtle so if you want something that will stand out try Granite Rain instead (I like that one too). It lasts me all day and has a pleasant and not over-powering scent.</li>
