      <li>I use this larger one at home just to safely store my oils in.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So cute! And does a great job at keeping my oils organized, safe, and snug! Good quality and I would definitely purchase another (if I ever accumulate more oils to need more space).</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes storing and carrying my oils so much easier.</li>
    <li> Very nice, protective case.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really hold the 15 ml bottles well. It really doesn&#x27;t hold 30 bottles ato all. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great item. I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!  Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> This product works very well with my EO collection which has varying sizes (5, 10 and 15 mm).  It can&#x27;t fit my 30mm, which I only have a few of those right now, so no biggie.  It is well made and I&#x27;ve opened and closed it a hundred times now and the zipper is good quality and doesn&#x27;t catch like some zippers do on cases.  Highly recommend!  I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> So awesome and at first I was like wait a min. Then I used it and am so pleased with how well it works. I just bought labels and now am using it. As you can see I have different sizes and they fit.</li>
    <li> Love this case for oils and the pocket to keep information on the bottom side!</li>
    <li> Pictured a little different but works great for my oils</li>
    <li> Fabulous quality.  Heavyduty.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this. Perfect for essential oils especially for taking them on the go with no spills. Wish I would have invested in one of these sooner.</li>
    <li> I love the way the bottles fit in here.  It is a perfect way to organize and move oils.</li>
    <li> Really like the carrying case.  It holds the vials firmly in place, so no worries of them shifting at all (all of my bottles are 10 ml or smaller).  Only reason I gave it 4 stars is the carrying handle seems pretty flimsy, just thin fabric.  Doesn&#x27;t really bother me, as I&#x27;m not going to be carrying it all over, but for someone who is, they might want to be aware of that.  Will buy another of this brand as I expand my use of oils.</li>
    <li> I put all my oils in this case. It is great!</li>
    <li> I love this case!  I have taken my oils (5mL and 15mL) in this case, roundtrip cross-country, twice, and they&#x27;ve been perfectly safe and protected.  I am actually about to order more, as my oil collection has exceeded 30 bottles.  :)</li>
    <li> Does NOT hold 30 15ml bottles as I was expecting. The material seems very cheap and when I pick it up by the handle the bottom of the container sags... I&#x27;m was so excited to get home and set my oils up in it and now I&#x27;m totally let down.</li>
    <li> Second case that we have bought!  Holds the oils safely and well!&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price!</li>
    <li> My girls want oil cases of their own too. Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Recommend!  Product arrived as expected and on time.  Will likely order again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what i wanted. Good description and value.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Portable and keeps my oils well organized.</li>
    <li> This essential oil carrying case is perfect for traveling with my essential oils. It has a handle to carry it with and holds up to 30 bottles. I love to make blends and it holds the roll on bottles inside also. I love the color and the portability of this case. It always goes with me on road trips. It is better to bring inside when we visit restaurants or we are just out and about in public. My other oil case is much bigger than this one. I like to choose which oils from my bigger case to pack in this one for outings since it&#x27;s super light and easy to carry.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I plan on ordering a second one. :)</li>
    <li> I got this and didn&#x27;t realize there were more than one size.  This is the taller version.  I like shorter one for my 5 &amp; 15 mL bottles.  I don&#x27;t put roll ons in my cases, but they would fit in here.  I gave this to my mom for a gift for mother&#x27;s day!  I have 2 of the shorter ones and LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I got this bag because I do a lot of traveling and I wanted something I can secure my essential oils in and would be easy to pack in my luggage. That is exactly what I got. The bag was very durable and easy to pack into my luggage. The zipper is very good standard and nice material. I am definently going to get my mother one for her birthday as to I know she will love it. I also needed my bag very soon as to my vacation was coming up and I needed it soon. I ordered this bag a week before I was leaving and I honestly did not expect it to be delivered on time. Surprisingly I got it a few days before it left so the shipping was a lot faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> Nice if you don&#x27;t have a lot or need to travel -</li>
    <li> It was good.  Just what I ordered.</li>
    <li> great item, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Not good if you have a lot of 15 ml bottles They won&#x27;t fit in here I ended up having to put a lot more 5 ml bottles in here as the spots will not allow you to use they almost close off wish I had bought a different one</li>
    <li> The bottles seem to be almost too tight when it is full. I had purchased one in the past and it holds the bottles fine. not sure what the difference is?</li>
    <li> Holds both small and large sized oils and is perfect for home and travel use!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a mixture of 15mL and 5 mL bottles. It&#x27;s okay, but would not be able to fit only 15 mL bottles. Just a heads up!</li>
    <li> Really glad I came across this! We travel a lot so this is perfect for me.. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with EO&#x27;s actually!</li>
    <li> I just received my case this week and have already used it.  Nice quality and the compartments are flexible enough to accommodate a bottle that is a little bit oversized. I put a roller bottle in the corner, and the lid still zipped.  You could not do this if you have several of the tall rollers, but one of two would work.  Sizes up to 15ml fit just fine as described.&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered one for a gift, and will have no trouble recommending this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Exactly what it looks like, and exactly what I needed. Lots of cushion between the oils, and perfect for regular sized bottles and smaller sample bottles.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived on time</li>
    <li> Nice soft holder for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> The material is much &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; than you would expect. It will sag and stretch out of shape... almost like a thin felt. It was not what I was expecting. It holds 30 of your 5ml bottles safely, but will not hold very many 15ml at all. I guess it&#x27;s an okay starter case.</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast shipping, beautiful, exactly what I was looking for to store my EOs</li>
    <li> love this and how soft and safe it is for the oils. Love how it accommodates the different size bottles too!</li>
    <li> Easy way to organize my oils !</li>
    <li> The 30-Bottle Essential Oil case is perfect....exactly what I was looking for!  I will definitely order another one when this one fills up!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Fills the purpose.</li>
    <li> I really like this case. I have it about half full and I will admit I am fairly clutzy. Every bottle has survived drops from the counter, slamming around etc. perfectly. It&#x27;s very well made and just stuffed well enough. Worth it. You may want to invest in bottle top labels though, it can take me a little bit to find what I need.</li>
    <li> Like this carrying case so much, I bough a smaller version to carry with me. I use this larger one at home just to safely store my oils in. It will hold all 15mL bottles, 5mL bottles or a mixture of both. It doesn&#x27;t squeeze them in there all awkward like others I have seen. The quality is great. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is the handle seems a little too narrow for me, especially when its completely full, but not worth taking a star over.</li>
    <li> This is great, and keeps them so organized.</li>
    <li> This is just like one that I lost. Holds my oils and keeps them safe and assesible. Only wish is that outer fabric was more dirt resitant.</li>
    <li> Great value.  I love my Young Living Essential Oils but the carrying case they have is a bit pricey. I ordered this one hoping for the best and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It is a good quality product.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Color is good. I didn&#x27;t like the way the material felt &amp;#34; ruff&amp;#34; I gave it away did not return it</li>
    <li> Not strong enough to hold the amount of oils</li>
    <li> Got this to transport my oils for an upcoming move and it seems like it will work perfectly! Last move, I wrapped each bottle in a paper towels and put them in baggies, this seems like a much better option! Will be needing to order another one, possibly two for all of my oils!</li>
    <li> Love it, just filled it up too fast. Will need another one.</li>
    <li> very nice wish they made bigger ones....</li>
    <li> I am an aromatherapist. I have three of these in different colors. Perfect for my needs - both for travel and office use. I get essential oil top labels that I fill in by hand so I can see from above what oil is what.</li>
    <li> Received yesterday...because inside lid was not seen/attached properly, I am giving it a 4 rating. I sewed the area up instead of returning, even plan to order another..Zipper works fine, well padded case, love the handle ad well as the storage area which I plan to use for an alpha list of my oils.</li>
    <li> Love love love this so much!!!!!</li>
    <li> Speedy service. Nice little case.</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping bottles of essentials oils and fragrance oils. Lots for padding for safety. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Color is perfect, works great.  The fabric could be a little nicer.</li>
    <li> It is a gift for my daughter in law for Christmas.  I hope she likes it.  It is okay.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this item!  I highly recommend it for all of your Young Living Oils!</li>
    <li> Great carrier with handle for oils.</li>
    <li> Really like this case. Keeps all my oils in one handy place. Nice that the dividers individually cushion the bottles. Only drawback is that it&#x27;s a pretty tight fit if trying to fit all 15 ml bottles in the case - they just wouldn&#x27;t fit. Overall, liked it well enough to purchase another one, since I have more than 30 bottles of essential oils.</li>
