<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> not what I expected  made  me itch</li>
    <li> I got a bottle of Tara a few years ago at a quaint little celtic store.  Apparently, it isn&#x27;t made anymore and someone suggested Innisfree instead.  I finally tried it and LOVE IT!!!!  It&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
    <li> The product is really hard to find in stores and the price is starting to go up on other sites. The product at Amazon was an excellent price and it was availble. We received it in a very short time. Excellent work and keep it up. We intend to use Amazon.com and Amozon.uk a lot more because you have items we like and us.    Thank you so much. You have made my wife very happy that she can still get her favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> I cannot locate this fragrance in retail stores.  This was a great price for the 1.7 oz spray.</li>
    <li> My wife first purchased Fragrances of Ireland when we were in Ireland years ago.  She really love the fragrance, and I like it when she wears it.    The service getting it to me for a Christmas gift was excellent.  Ordered it one day, two days later it was here.    Thank You.</li>
    <li> A wonderful companion fragrance to my spouse&#x27;s Inis.&lt;br /&gt;Sophisticated</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  Heard from relatives in Ireland that it is discontinued.  Bought all bottles left.</li>
    <li> My wife, and I, discovered this wonderful, unique and evocative scent while on our third cycling trip around the Emerald Isle, this most recent one to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. This bouquet of so many well blended natural fragrances, some recognizable and others softly mysterious, captivated us instantly. A perfume my wife enrobes herself in on a very regular basis.  A touch of the Isle with us here in Canada. . . .We will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree . . .</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas. All the flowers to make this perfume are grown in County Wicklow, Ireland. Support Irish industry, buy Irish products.</li>
    <li> This will become my signature fragrance.  Beautifully light and floral, but lasts all day without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> We bought our first bottle when we were touring Ireland few years ago. When the bottle was used up we tried to buy at many stores including Macy&#x27;s and few other stores with no luck. Then we tried Amazon and was available at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived as expected. Great perfume and I think every woman would love it if they try it. We get many compliments. We are actually surprised that it is not widely available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it once and you most likely will be hooked for a lifetime!</li>
    <li> Innisfree was a find from one trip to Ireland - it is a light fragrance and I get compliments every time I wear it which is daily :-)  It is wonderful! I wear it to remind me of Ireland until my next trip.</li>
    <li> Of course, my wife uses this and I have never smelled a perfume as wonderful as this.  I told her to get rid of all the rest.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing! I love how it work with any ones natural pheromones, it gives it a unique fragrance for each person! This bottle can last about year, depending on how much you use but a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I discovered this on a trip to Ireland and fell in love with the delicate scent.  It lasts for hours and is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  It is very light, clean, and feminine.  I get so many compliments from both men and ladies when I wear it  smells like fresh air and sunshine.</li>
    <li> I first found this fragrance while I was traveling in Ireland.  It is one of the best scents - light, great for daily wear.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used Innisfree Perfume for years and am so glad I can still get it. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> feminine scent made me think of the heathers and other greenery of Ireland.  merchandise more affordable than other sites I,d checked so appreciate it.</li>
    <li> Found this in Ireland years ago and have been using it ever since...love it...light, not overpowering</li>
    <li> I found this when I went to Ireland in the Spring. Love at first whiff!!!!!!!!!!!! Will never wear another scent,</li>
    <li> This made the perfect Christmas gift. It&#x27;s flowery but clean smelling too.</li>
    <li> Smells beautiful! But, everything from Ireland is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this beautiful fragrance for years. It&#x27;s unique and different from conventional department store fragrances. Made in Ireland, it was hard to find. So glad that I can easily order it on Amazon. It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
    <li> excellent merchandise and service</li>
    <li> I really love this product and the site always get what I order very quickly and at a resonable price I will order again</li>
    <li> A gift for my sister who had bought this scent while on a trip to Ireland about 10 years ago. She had been unable to find it since.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little confused, because I once owned a fragrance from Ireland, called just, &amp;#34;Innisfree,&amp;#34; and it came in a Kelly green box and a Kelly green bottle.  The one shown here has an added title, and different packaging, but I&#x27;m assuming it must be the same thing.  At any rate, my late Mom was in Ireland many years ago.  While there, she asked around for a recommendation for a gift to bring back for me.  She was told by many, &amp;#34;Inisfree.&amp;#34;  I flipped over the fragrance.  Though I had never been to Ireland, I felt I was being transported there in some weird way.  It just makes you think of the green outdoors and really clean air after a rain storm.  I had never smelled anything like it, and it is hard to describe.  At one time, I was able to buy this in Irish stores only.  I haven&#x27;t had it in years, and miss it.  I was surprised to see that several people had given this a one star rating.</li>
    <li> really preferred this over &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; inis, but other products are very limited here, so returned to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; inis. great fragrance!</li>
    <li> My dreams  of Ireland are so close...the scent of the perfume is as bright and soft as I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> To me, this smelled like the powder my elderly neighbor used to wear but with the astringent quality of bugspray. I was hoping to get lucky, but I guess that&#x27;s what I get for blindly purchasing fragrance online.&lt;br /&gt;There was a lot of hype with the other reviews, i.e., smell like Ireland! Fresh fields! Dewey mornings! That is not how I took it. I literally had to wash it off, it smelled so bad to me. It&#x27;s been about four hours and despite my thorough scrub, I can still smell it. I will say that it is long lasting. And what I can still smell isn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; as it was the first hour or so. I would think that an older lady might like it quite a bit. Or, if it really does smell like Ireland, then maybe someone from Ireland would like it. I haven&#x27;t had the pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;I might have given it three stars, but since I can&#x27;t return it, one star. That is my fault. I should have looked into the return policy for purchasing fragrances on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I first bought this in Ireland when visiting. Light but fresh smelling. Great for daytime use. Ever since then, every time I use it, I am right back in Ireland when I first apply it in the morning. Amazing how scents evoke such vivid memories.</li>
    <li> This scent is the very favorite of a dear friend and so rave reviews are always around when an occasion arises and she is the recipient of it!&lt;br /&gt;She brought it home fron Ireland in 1999 and has been wearing ever since!</li>
    <li> Love this scent and the only one I wear.</li>
    <li> Just thought I&#x27;d take a chance and my wife and I love it. Many compliments given to her. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I love the whole line of Inis products.  They all smell wonderful.  Very unique scents.  I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> My mother LOVES this perfume&#x27;s light floral scent and the fact it comes from Ireland. By far the best price I&#x27;ve found here or there!</li>
    <li> Received this product in record time and LOVE IT!!  Wish they had a lotion as well!  Will order it again when this is gone.  Have received compliments when wearing it.</li>
    <li> ...love it,the fragrance is so fresh and last all day long...highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Just as good as when I first bought this when I was in Ireland .  I love it.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this I was in Ireland.  I absolutely love it and get many compliments on it.  I wear it everyday and was so happy to find it here on Amazon because I doubt I will be able to get back to Ireland.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance. Wear it morning , noon and night.&lt;br /&gt;I love it !  I will definitely get more.</li>
    <li> I am a nurse and should not wear fragrance, however this is so LIGHT and it lasts along time. I am constantly getting compliments. I started wearing it several years ago but it became very difficult to find, now I can use it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> The smell of Innisfree brings me back to memories of my trips to Ireland.  It is like having a bit of a vacation in a bottle.  The parfum is light and aromatic.  Everyone always remarks when I wear the parfum and it has become a trade mark for me.  Thank the heavens that my package came quickly after I ordered it.  I felt as if I wasn&#x27;t completely dressed without it.  It is a wonderful way to feel very special.</li>
    <li> This is my very favorite perfume.  I purchased the first bottle of it while in Ireland.  When it was gone, I was concerned that I would never find it in USA.  But, of course I found it on Amazon. Now that I have had to reorder, I am surprised and dismayed at the increase in price.  I paid less for 1.7 oz. for this item a couple years ago than I paid for 1.0 oz. this time.  Also, what is with the cost of $999 for the 1.7 oz. size? I would never pay that much.  Was that a typo, or is that really the price?  I&#x27;m changing my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because of the outrageous pricing.</li>
    <li> This has been my elderly mothers favorite perfume for nearly 20 years. Before Amazon and the Internet it was often impossible to find. Now, when she runs out, she lets me know and it&#x27;s a cinch to order more.&lt;br /&gt;She calls this &amp;#34;one of my pleasures in life&amp;#34;,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I am able to find this without a problem because it&#x27;s nice to give her &amp;#34;one of her life&#x27;s pleasures&amp;#34; and she actually smells very nice when she wears it.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my granddaughter at Amherst College as a gift for St. Patricks day. She liked it and took it with her to Texas,&lt;br /&gt; where she was competing in the NCAA swim finals.  She won 7 All-American  places,[ and all due to her Inisfree Fragrance...?]</li>
    <li> If you have ever walked through a field of flowers with drops of dew still clinging to them you will like this parfum.</li>
    <li> First found it in Ireland and my wife loved it as did I.  Glad to find it online, even though I would like to go back to Ireland.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend who is interested in Irish Literature, esp. Yeats. She really was happy with it. I also love the perfume-- soft, etheral, elegant. It&#x27;s good for a romantic evening, I&#x27;d say. The packaging was good and I was impressed with the short time it took to arrive at my door.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Reminds me of my honeymoon in Ireland</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  It is &amp;#34;multi-layered&amp;#34; but still light. I get many inquiries and compliments when I am wearing it.</li>
    <li> In 1990 i  went to ireland and found my signature fragrance and have worn it ever since. It has become very hard to find in the u.s. but last month I found it on amazon and bought 2 bottles. on my safari into amazon I found readily found my person treasure!!!! thanks again for the prompt response. bea Sutherland</li>
    <li> This fragrance from Ireland is light but memorable. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last however,  you must  ad another spray to  have it with you</li>
    <li> We where in Irland years ago. and love the land and the People were the SWEETEST.&lt;br /&gt;When we where in the Winslow airers  my husband liked the fragrant and on me he realy LOVED it.&lt;br /&gt;SOOOO here we are..  :)</li>
    <li> Another beautiful Inis perfume, Inisfree has alittle more spice , woody, floral, more bite to it! Last all day!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You! Inis&lt;br /&gt;Tamara</li>
    <li> My wife loves this fragrance and have bought this before.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is nice, bought for my lady, item was as described. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> This was as pretty a smell as I remembered. Saw it in a shop on the Bunratty Castle estate in Ireland.I didn&#x27;t buy it then and regretted it, so happy I found it online.</li>
    <li> I first bought this in Ireland.  I loved it then, and I love it now.</li>
    <li> Love some of this company&#x27;s fragrances, i.e., Inis Energy of the Sea, so thought I&#x27;d branch out and try others by them.  Saw a favorable review, so chose to try this one.  AWFUL!  Definitely won&#x27;t order this again!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE all of the other Inis fragrances. But this one was terrible. It&#x27;s nothing like the others (clean, fresh, soft floral, or ocean-like). It is way overpowering and frankly smells like bad body odor with powder under it. If you like the overpowering perfumes, then maybe you&#x27;ll like this. But I highly recommend trying to smell a sample first. In all my life, I&#x27;ve never met a man who would like to smell this on a woman. It&#x27;s been many years since I smelled Poison or Opium, but I think they were this way. I just want to warn others out there given that it is nothing at all like other Inis fragrances.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent and it was wonderful.  I smell like I just came back from Ireland.  Love it, love it</li>
    <li> I first was introduced to Inisfree perfume when I travelled to Ireland in 2002--I bought a couple of bottles and was hooked--I used to be able to buy it at an Irish import shop near my home but they no longer carry it--I am SOO glad I can get it via Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Innisfree is my favorite among the Fragrances of Ireland scents:  Light, floral, indescribably different from anything else you will find anywhere. If you want an everyday scent that&#x27;s good for both work and romance that you won&#x27;t smell \\&quot;coming and going,\\&quot; give this one a try.  Between the various Amazon vendors you can find it reasonably priced and it&#x27;s absolutely worth trying, betting you will love it too!</li>
    <li> only the best irish perfume and soooo full a good aroma and the history of the past. would highly reccommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance when my husband and I were in Ireland! I knew that Amazon would have it!!!! It is so clean, ertheral smell, try it!!!!</li>
    <li> Inisfree is my all-time favorite frangrance!  Light and refreshing!  I originally purchased Inisfree in Ireland, and am delighted to be able to order on line when my supply is low.</li>
    <li> Great gift idea for mom when we were in ireland she loved this scent. And now she knows where to get it from here in the states!</li>
    <li> I really like this fragrance and it lasts a long time. I will continue to purchase this item. I am going to gift my Pastor&#x27;s wife with a bottle since he likes it so much!</li>
    <li> This Innis brand in their line of perfumes is now becoming another favorite.  Brings back the essence of Ireland that you would picture in your mind.  So clean and fresh.  Nothing else like the Innis line.  Long lasting but not overpowering.</li>
