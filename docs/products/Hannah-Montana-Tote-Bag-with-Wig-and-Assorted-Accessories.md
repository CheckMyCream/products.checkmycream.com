      <li>She loved it and put it on right away.  </li>

      <li>the accessories all add to the ensemble and the wig is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It comes with a hairnet, a necessity because the nylon wig get tangled easily once you take it off.</li>
      <li>It also rats easy</li>
      <li>The skull cap is soft and stretchy and has an elastic band that fastens at the neck hairline to hold the wig in place - nice!</li>
      <li>Her friends enjoy it also.</li>
      <li>Fun way for our children to be able to imitate one3 of their stars at an affordable price</li>
      <li>She had a great time with all the different pieces.</li>
      <li>I decided not to buy this as it wont be available for Halloween.</li>
      <li>The product was received in a very timely manner, it was in good condition, and it contained exactly what was advertised.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased with both the price and quality of this product and would recommend it for any young lady.</li>
      <li>thats right and people need to know they probably will not recieve this item in time!  </li>
      <li>The accessories are adequate - the sunglasses are like any inexpensive kid sunglasses (</li>
      <li>although delays prevented us from getting both before the holiday, the merchandise was definitely worth it</li>
      <li>My niece plays with it all the time and has a lot of fun.</li>
      <li>although I don&#x27;t remember ever seeing Hannah Montana wearing that style), the neck scarf is fine, the earrings are sturdy enough for dress-up, although the microphone is a cheap piece of glitter covered styrofoam.</li>
      <li>And what was received will hopefully still make our very picky little girl happy.</li>
      <li>The product was exactly as the description said it would be, and was of decent quality.</li>
      <li>This whole set would have been a steal at $15, but was not quite $37 quality (which is what I paid including shipping).     </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really think much of the product, but my niece wanted it, so I got it for her.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>This little set is ok for the price.  </li>
      <li>She loved it, but kept getting annoyed that the glasses kept falling off her face.  </li>
      <li>This Hanna Montana wig and accessories is fun, but the wig gets really tangled pretty quickly and the glasses are way too big for a little girl.  </li>
      <li>Several strands fell out before the first night was over.</li>
      <li>Unfortunatly you can&#x27;t always depend on internet, sometimes you gotta go old school!</li>
      <li>I ordered this for a friend&#x27;s little girl who is a HUGE Hannah Montana fan.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this for my 10-year old niece for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this item for my 9-year old daughter on August 27, 2007 to wear for Halloween.  </li>
      <li>My 5-year old daughter has given this as a birthday gift twice - by her request.  </li>
      <li>My 7 year old daughter loves this.</li>
      <li>it is kind of thin, but she still likes wearing it even though it&#x27;s all tangled.</li>
      <li>Needless to say, it won&#x27;t do me any good at that point</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled to pay more, but I was afraid that as Halloween grows closer it will get harder to find!</li>
      <li>The wig has a beautiful color but is almost impossible to keep untangled.</li>
      <li>The sales clerk told me that they have been selling out fast, but receiving new shipments almost every other day.  </li>
      <li>The earlier delivery date for this item is early November.</li>
      <li>It combs out with some patience using a wide tooth comb or brush, gently.    </li>
      <li>Actually it exceeded my expectations as far as quality.   </li>

<li> The same number of items were in the bag, at least.</li>
<li> At least do what other websites do and mark it as temporarily not available until all prior orders have been fulfilled.</li>
<li> I think she was half asleep.</li>
<li> Like everyone else that has submitted reviews, I was unable to receive my order in time for Halloween, although I ordered in early September.</li>
<li> Horrible wig was torn it was very cheaply made.</li>
<li> Instead, I cancelled my order and purchased this exact wig and accessories set from WorldToys (also on Amazon) for over twice the amount :-(</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it is near impossible to maintain and keep untangled.  </li>
<li> I believe every person who has written a terrible review on this product has every right.</li>
<li> Purchased this product for my god daughter who is absolutely crazy about hannah montanna.  </li>
<li> I just ordered this wig also, but was afraid it would not come it time.  </li>
<li> Very disappointing</li>
<li> I think that it is terrible that this item hasn&#x27;t been shipped to all of the buyers who have ordered this months ago</li>
<li> Horrible quality, just go to the wig shop to play dress up.</li>

    <li> I just ordered this wig also, but was afraid it would not come it time.  I also just recently bought it at Justice store for 16.99, plus 20% off.  I will hang on to the one I just bought from Justice until I receive the one from amazon, or if It doesn&#x27;t come I will cancel my order and keep the one from Justice.  Unfortunatly you can&#x27;t always depend on internet, sometimes you gotta go old school!</li>
    <li> Like everyone else that has submitted reviews, I was unable to receive my order in time for Halloween, although I ordered in early September. Instead, I cancelled my order and purchased this exact wig and accessories set from WorldToys (also on Amazon) for over twice the amount :-( but it arrived about 3 days after I ordered it from World Toys.    The product itself was really nice - the wig has great colors, very true to life in the blond highlights and caramel lowlights, even has well-cut bangs. It looks a thousand times better than the ugly white-blond Hannah Montana wig that I&#x27;ve seen sold everyone else (Target, Walmart, etc). The skull cap is soft and stretchy and has an elastic band that fastens at the neck hairline to hold the wig in place - nice! My daughter looks adorable in it. It comes with a hairnet, a necessity because the nylon wig get tangled easily once you take it off. It combs out with some patience using a wide tooth comb or brush, gently.    The accessories are adequate - the sunglasses are like any inexpensive kid sunglasses (although I don&#x27;t remember ever seeing Hannah Montana wearing that style), the neck scarf is fine, the earrings are sturdy enough for dress-up, although the microphone is a cheap piece of glitter covered styrofoam. This whole set would have been a steal at $15, but was not quite $37 quality (which is what I paid including shipping).     I attempted to communicate twice with Amazon by web/email re the changing shipping date, but customer service was unhelpful, although polite and apologetic. I will never again order anything from Amazon that is not already in stock. I&#x27;ve always had a great experience with them before now, so I will continue to shop here.</li>
    <li> My 5-year old daughter has given this as a birthday gift twice - by her request.  It has been a very popular item!</li>
    <li> This little set is ok for the price.  My daughter had a blast wearing it, but after one time wearing it the hair is all matted and when I try to brush it, the hair starts to fall out.  There is not a lot of hair to begin with - it is kind of thin, but she still likes wearing it even though it&#x27;s all tangled. It stretches and fits well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really think much of the product, but my niece wanted it, so I got it for her. Package arrived on time and in good shape. No problems with the transaction. My niece plays with it all the time and has a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> My 7 year old daughter loves this. Her friends enjoy it also. It&#x27;s great fun for kids that are Hannah Montana fans.</li>
    <li> I did not have any problems with Amazon or the seller. Everything was great. The tote bag and other items were a hit with my nine year old daughter, however, the wig is not very sturdy. Several strands fell out before the first night was over. Very disappointing but she still enjoys it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a friend&#x27;s little girl who is a HUGE Hannah Montana fan.  She loved it.  The product was exactly as the description said it would be, and was of decent quality.</li>
    <li> The wig has a beautiful color but is almost impossible to keep untangled. Now it looks like my daughter has a nest on her head.</li>
    <li> thats right and people need to know they probably will not recieve this item in time!  How can you give it 5 stars if you don&#x27;t even have the item ?</li>
    <li> I believe every person who has written a terrible review on this product has every right. I ordered this product on August 10,2007 for my daughter to use as part of her Halloween costume. It was a pre-order item before it  was due to be released. The shipment date then got pushed to September now it has been pushed out again to November. Needless to say, it won&#x27;t do me any good at that point and I canceled the order. I went to CLub LibbyLu and purchased all of the items that I needed. They had plenty in stock. Also, as for Amazon and whomever the merchant is that they are dealing with for this product. I think that it is terrible that this item hasn&#x27;t been shipped to all of the buyers who have ordered this months ago and you still have the nerve to display the item as available!!! At least do what other websites do and mark it as temporarily not available until all prior orders have been fulfilled.</li>
    <li> my kids are big fans of the show and were hyped to go as hannah for halloween .. although delays prevented us from getting both before the holiday, the merchandise was definitely worth it and they are pleased.  the accessories all add to the ensemble and the wig is pretty good.  as long as they&#x27;re happy, i&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t seem to excite her when she opened it Christmas morning.  I think she was half asleep.</li>
    <li> Fun way for our children to be able to imitate one3 of their stars at an affordable price</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the review info that I read! Boy was I disapointed. The wig will not stay on and you can see the net underneath. It also rats easy</li>
    <li> This Hanna Montana wig and accessories is fun, but the wig gets really tangled pretty quickly and the glasses are way too big for a little girl.  She loved it, but kept getting annoyed that the glasses kept falling off her face.  She played with it for a day, and hasn&#x27;t picked it up since.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my 9-year old daughter on August 27, 2007 to wear for Halloween.  I thought it would arrive in plenty of time, but the date kept getting pushed back.  I did find this item on E-Bay Express for twice the price, and I decided to go ahead and cancel my order and order from there.  I wasn&#x27;t thrilled to pay more, but I was afraid that as Halloween grows closer it will get harder to find!</li>
    <li> The items in the bag were not exactly the same as shown online. The earings and sunglasses were not the same ones as in the picture when ordering. The same number of items were in the bag, at least. And what was received will hopefully still make our very picky little girl happy.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter had a \\&quot;Hannah Montana\\&quot; Christmas with CD&#x27;s, DVD&#x27;s and a guitar so this wig, microphone, sunglasses, etc. was the perfect topping. It wasn&#x27;t overpriced and was indeed a great hit.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this at a great price.  BUT the wig, after 2 days looks like straw.  Cannot comb throught the plactic hair. Horrible quality, just go to the wig shop to play dress up.</li>
    <li> The appearance of the wig is pretty good.  Actually it exceeded my expectations as far as quality.   Loved the accessories that came with the wig.  Definitely a bargain.  Unfortunately, it is near impossible to maintain and keep untangled.  My daughter loves it anyway.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 6 and I got her the Hannah Montana tote with wig and accessories for Christmas. She absolutley loved it, as did her cousins ages 5-11. She wore it all day. I highly recommend this item. The wig is good quality. I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 10-year old niece for Christmas.  She loved it and put it on right away.  She had a great time with all the different pieces.</li>
    <li> The product was received in a very timely manner, it was in good condition, and it contained exactly what was advertised.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> Horrible wig was torn it was very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Hello all,    I want to buy this for my daughter just like you all are. I had called Amazon before placing an order, to make sure if I will get this before Halloween. The CS representative said that this will NOT be delivered before Halloween if I placed the order. The earlier delivery date for this item is early November. I decided not to buy this as it wont be available for Halloween.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my god daughter who is absolutely crazy about hannah montanna.  I was very pleased with both the price and quality of this product and would recommend it for any young lady. This was purchased as a christmas gift and I am sure she is going to love it as did I.</li>
    <li> Guys, this product is great and I found many today at Claire&#x27;s Boutique.  The sales clerk told me that they have been selling out fast, but receiving new shipments almost every other day.  If you need this by Halloween, go to your local Claire&#x27;s.</li>
