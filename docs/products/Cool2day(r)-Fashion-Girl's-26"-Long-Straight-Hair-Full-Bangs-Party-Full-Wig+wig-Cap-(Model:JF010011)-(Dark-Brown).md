<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is better than expected. I love it.</li>
    <li> I use this while i&#x27;m growing my hair back out and it works really well for me. Alot of people have been t&#x60;elling me that they can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s a wig and that it looks so natural on me. So i&#x27;m very happy with it!! thanks!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING quality. BUT if not maintained correctly it FRAYS. It is very soft. Its real enough to be worn every day. WILL BE BUYING AGAIN. Even with the fraying, I still give it 5 stars. BUY a wig brush to keep it from fraying.</li>
    <li> It has a nice feel to it, but it was definitely not the length pictured on the model. I was quite disappointed about that.</li>
    <li> This was one of the worst hair pieces I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Like baby doll hair only worse.  But what can you expect for $7.00.  Oh well, lesson learned</li>
    <li> I know some people think it&#x27;s too thin or too shiny, but I think its perfect.  It did take a long time to get here (from China) but its worth the wait...... Especially for the price. This will deffinetly be my everyday wig. Its comfortable and doesn&#x27;t move at all on my head. I will for sure order more for back up.</li>
    <li> My wife has short hair and she like to wear wigs in braids or ponytails andd this lon wig in now in a perfect braid ready to go out at a moments notice. She enjoys changing her outfit and now her hair stlye fast and easy.</li>
    <li> I love this wig!!! it feels so real and looks real!! if they didn&#x27;t tell me it wasn&#x27;t real i wouldn&#x27;t know!  the closer is good and the hair is soo soft and nice . its not as long and thick as the picture but it still is VERY good. and if your buying this before a party or event get it atlease 1 week before because it does take awhile to get there.</li>
    <li> The wig is pretty good quality overall. I&#x27;ve styled it a few times now and it has held up well. The length is very good, though not quite as long as in the picture, and I found the color to be accurately depicted. But the bangs suck. They&#x27;re really thin compared to the rest of the wig and the way they sit just looks horrible. I&#x27;ve tried styling them a few different ways and the only way I can make them look okay is to just pin them to the side. Other than that, though, it&#x27;s a great wig for the price.</li>
    <li> As always with Cool2Day&#x27;s products, the wig was SUPER soft! And it was shipped within 4 days. The color is almost black, which is actually what I wanted, so if you order this wig keep in mind that the color will be darker! The bangs were really weird when in came, I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to style them right, so I sweep them to the side. It has been about 3 weeks since I have owned it and the ends show signs wear, but I can always trim them off ^^ I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this wig. I spray Mane n Tail detangler on it and it is easy to brush. Looked exactly in the picture and was the described length. I received it on time as well. I bought three more from this seller. I love their wigs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig to have something to wear for school and it just looks entirely too shiny and the length is shorter than pictured. The color was also a bit darker, which I guess is a good thing. All in all the wig is good, very good, it&#x27;s the quality of the wig us what turns me away from it. And, this was my first wig, so now I know better. This company sells good stuff, just this wig in particular wasn&#x27;t what was good. Definitely better in the picture.</li>
    <li> Weakly stitched, constantly shedding, and the hair is so thin it tangles almost instantly. The built in cap is loosley sewn, and the &amp;#34;adjustable&amp;#34; straps and their clips are laughable as well as the ribbon they are supposed to attach to. A waste of even the cheap price, I only validated my purchase to myself by using the hair to wrap a few hair accessories, like a hair tie and bow, and to re-wig an antique doll. Save your money, and if you&#x27;re going for a synthetic, spend twice as much on a Melody Susie.</li>
    <li> After almost a month of waiting I finally received it. Since the envelope was only sealed with a string it was already opened. Then I take it out to put it on and I love how it fits but man oh man does it shed! Just running my fingers through it I got almost 3 hand fulls of hair! I scared to see what a brush will do to it!</li>
    <li> colour totally different from what is displayed on the website, my gf purchased the dark brown and got an extremely light shdae that doesn&#x27;t suit her skin tone. she threw it in a corner.</li>
    <li> cute SOFT and that natural fit</li>
    <li> I love the style of this wig, but it was supposed to be dark brown and came with a very fake-looking red color to it. It&#x27;s brown, but definitely NOT the normal brown I was going for. After three washings, I also cannot get the fake-looking shine off. As someone who wears wigs every day, this is definitely not going to work as an every day wig. If they could fix the color to actually be dark brown and not look like when my daughter mixes brown and red playdough, that would be great.</li>
    <li> I got this wig in the mail today on the 18th, but it was scheduled to arrive on the 16th, so that was a bit of a bother. It was also listed as delivered when it wasn&#x27;t yet, which made me worry about whether the product was coming or not. It came with a cap to place on your head before putting on the wig, which was convenient, but the wig came darker than listed (a dark brown close to black depending on the lighting)and a lot shorter. A lot. The picture shows it going to near the top of her waist (definitely below the small of her back,) but mine barely goes over my chest, which is bad for me because I needed it to be the length shown for my project (and look that I&#x27;m close to the size of the girl in the picture.) It was a let-down for what I needed for my project, but as far as wigs go, were I just ordering this for fun without the need for its physical aspects to meet certain standards, I would be extremely happy with the wig. Was it a lot shorter? Yes, but it came with a plus - it&#x27;s thicker than pictured (so I guess the length that was supposed to be there went to volume, or they sent me the wrong wig.) It also has some nice layers, and although it&#x27;s shiny in places, the layers give it a more realistic look. It also fits my head really well, and the material is so soft that by feel alone, one would think it&#x27;s real hair. I look freaking awesome in it, and it really looks like my hair, only longer, so I would definitely wear it in public. The only problem is that it tangles pretty frequently, although it untangles easily. Try to unknot the tangles with your fingers, because when I use a brush, a lot of hair comes out of the wig. I try to not brush it because I don&#x27;t want it to be gone already, lol. It&#x27;s good if you want hair (or longer hair,) a different hairstyle, or you&#x27;re getting it just for kicks. It&#x27;s a fantastic wig for the price, but don&#x27;t expect to get what you see.</li>
    <li> I just got my wig today.its freaken awsome it feels like real hair. The reason i went after this wig was because of 2 reasons,one i am losing my hair an two it was super cheap.I love it I will really reccomand this to many others an  be buying again.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as long as I expected but its satisfactory. It looks shiny so I just sprinkle a bit of baby powder to make it look more natural. I had a lot of compliments on it. I used it in plays at my school and people thought it was my real hair~ I also used it for a few cosplays at Anime Expo!</li>
    <li> Good for the price, but it is kinda thin. I have dark hair already, so it doesn&#x27;t show through, but beware if you have lighter hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap product. You get what you pay for. I didn&#x27;t know synthetic hair could tangle that bad. No amount of brushing could fix it. Finally I cut over half of it off in hopes of fixing the problem (up to my shoulders) but it still tangled. A customer at work asked why I was wearing a wig (which has never happened with my other wigs) and coworkers said it didn&#x27;t look as natural as my other wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waist you money if you are looking for something to wear into public.</li>
    <li> We buy a lot of props for my daughters YouTube show Seven Perfect Angels, and this wig is so realistic looking!  You could not even tell it was a wig!  Has a beautiful shine to it in the sunlight</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a stickler when it comes to wigs and this was amazing for the price. High quality, easy to brush, and very soft.</li>
    <li> I needed a wig for cosplay and casual wear, this is the second wig I have bought from amazon (Ordered it from the seller PDS Online), It arrived very fast. Its very smooth and so cute! It doesn&#x27;t shed a lot and its not too long, the color looks a bit different from the picture but it actually looks a lot cuter that way, it has a reddish/strawberry tint of color, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the wig is a little thin, but its still thick enough for it to be wearable. Overall I am very satisfied and I am looking forward to wearing this to the next con I go to :)</li>
    <li> Super soft and natural looking! Some people have reported the bangs to be weird? I didn&#x27;t understand that... you just pull it back a bit so it sits right on your natural hair line and it&#x27;s supposed to be a straight cut/blunt bang... it&#x27;s supposed to be a little bit long so that you can style it to fit your face so that it looks more natural in the end... I love mine to death and I&#x27;m picky about wigs (I&#x27;m a cosplayer, so I know how important a good looking wig can be)!</li>
    <li> Wig arrived a day before christmas. Longer than I expected but great quality love the color..it&#x27;s really soft and flows nice. Would definitely recommend this site to anyone looking for a quality wig for cheap.</li>
    <li> The wig is wonderful, my only complaint is how long it took to ship and that there was no tracking info. I wear it a lot, after a few months it has started to show a little bit, but the fibers are very natural looking and feeling. It arrives almost exactly as pictures, the bangs go straight across, not side swept like on the mannequin.</li>
    <li> Eh its ok, kind of small though</li>
    <li> Im big on wigs and its rare you find a wig so cheap in cost but great in quality and I kept that in mind when buying this item. I got exactly what I prepared for. Now dont get me wrong I speak only positive into my life, in this case I&#x27;m glad i prepared myself for lower quality than I prefer. Very plastic-y, but with the care i give my wigs, I was able to wear it for a month. Then I gave it to my little sister as a training starter wig. (it was still in really good condition lol)</li>
    <li> purchase this wig.On the day I got it I turn around and send it right back, it is cheap looking and all tangled up. All I can say is this wig is a hot mess.</li>
    <li> The feel and texture of the wig feels like real hair! Excellent product and really long hair! I had other more expensive wigs that were just not as great as this one! Great wig to go clubbing!</li>
    <li> Not my cup of tea. Very shiny, overly shiny. HEAVY heavy bang like the bang is unnatural. I cant and dont want to know how much hair was in this thing. It is too thick and then to be shiny and straight like that, its alot of hair. Not to discourage anyone from buying it but this is just what i thought. Only giving it 3 stars, 1 would be too cruel. I actually did wear it once, or twice (i can&#x27;t remember) to school but with a hat. Its your choice. Wigs are something i think u should buy in person to get a better feel and look of it. I admit i did buy it because it was cheap but no more. Quality &gt; quanity. Hopefully i helped someone out there. I actually ended up throwing this wig away... not soon as i got it but i couldnt find any use for it... after i had worn it those two occasions... was just sitting around so... trash. Guess it allll depends on u guys and what u want. Get what u want, use your judgement and try to make a smart choice. If u get it and dont like it, dont be upset. Just know u NEVER have to get it again.:)</li>
    <li> I wasted my money or better yet you get what you paid for. It was tangled when I received it and I never could untangle it. I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> became frizzy fast...</li>
    <li> I bought this wig to cut and style for a costume I&#x27;m doing for a convention. The wig was packaged nicely and got here in great condition. One thing to note is that it comes with a mesh cap. It didn&#x27;t mention that in the listing, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it in the package when it arrived!</li>
    <li> I love this wig! It doesnt seem like its 25\\&quot; (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4) but its long enough. I barely had to cut the bangs, as soon as I put it on it was perfect. Plus, I used Prime&#x27;s 2-day shipping! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course its going to get tangled and shed easily, its not human/virgin hair. Duh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig compliments my caramel skin, high cheekbones and almond shaped eyes. I use it for my modeling career, not everyday use.</li>
    <li> I loved the picture of this wig. I checked the mail for 3 weeks it came a few days early which made me happy. I opened and put it on. Its horrible. If you like the hair cut Jim carry has in dumb and dumber except long this is the wig for you. Blunt cut bangs not side swept at all.you get what you pay for. You do get a free wig cap though.</li>
    <li> super straight and very soft</li>
    <li> Very nice wig looks great on my blow up toy makes her look so real I just the way it feels</li>
    <li> I like it no complaints I came when it said it would and I cant really argue with that at all</li>
    <li> Did not come in a box as pictured, instead, tangled up and tossed in a plastic bag. Also, does not include wig cap. This wig is VERY shiny, but can be dulled by using a small amount of dish soap, in a half full tub of water. Simply swish the water, let the wig soak for a moment and then hang it up to dry. Worth the price, but not a dollar more. Good for cosplay, can be passed off as realisitc if you take the time to style it. The bangs however are HORRENDOUS! Mine were not cut straight across as pictured, but are a bit off (in a wave pattern), giving me that &amp;#34;I&#x27;m 5 and cut my own bangs when no one was watching&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> Got this for a cosplay. Looks just like the pictures, looks real, doesn&#x27;t tangle that much. My aunt was convinced it was really hair!</li>
    <li> Super sexy and looks real when it&#x27;s worn. It feels like real hair and it&#x27;s very easy to maintain. Thanks for such a great product with a great price.</li>
    <li> Seriously, the bangs look like a 4 year old cut them DON&#x27;T BELIEVE THE PICTURES.... It&#x27;s not even worth returning. I&#x27;m going to melt it all down....</li>
    <li> The cap part of the wig where the hair is held in place bunches up in two areas on the sides and sticks through. That just might be the only downside. It was very soft and I gaffe brushed it multiple times and it hasn&#x27;t started fraying.</li>
    <li> The item was nice, But in the end I returned it. The color wasn&#x27;t as dark as the one on the mannequin (looked more like the model picture). The wig was nice and silky. I will order another like it, just in a different color and length.</li>
    <li> Hi, I ordered this wig and I love it. I ordered it for my Ran Mouri costume. It was just as excepted and described. Awesome seller too. Ran Mouri is the favorite character from Detective  Conan.</li>
    <li> This wig is a bit thin and the bangs really suck. They seriously really are crappy. Spend a bit more and get a melodysusie straight wig. I loved my melody Susie curly wig, my straight one is on its way. Ps I have absolutely no affiliation with melody Susie, just giving my advice.</li>
    <li> The wig arrived sooner than I expected. It wasn&#x27;t as full as I thought it would be, but for the price, it was nice. I wore it a few times before it started to tangle. It looked nice on me.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with the wig when I got it there was only one clip to size.the other clip was hanging off most of the thread Was messed up not holding any of the hair dowm .. So I have have wig have hair net showing. But the feel of the hair yeah its good I just wish I was able to were this and not have wast my money on it.</li>
    <li> I really love this wig. It looks very real. It is very soft and cut good. I wear it a lot out and have had compliments on it. I bring a brush along with me to brush it when it gets tangled and it brushes really well. It does have some hair fall out of it every time I brush it but its not too much. I have enjoyed this wig and love the color. Beautiful color! Beautiful length. I would buy this wig again. The cap is not stretchy or tight fitting so it is easy to put your hair under it. It doesn&#x27;t fit tight to the head but it doesn&#x27;t look bad and you can tighten the sides so it won&#x27;t come off. The cap is not elastic, its just like one of those silky nets.</li>
    <li> I got it and it was bunched up and knotted I brushed it out and it&#x27;s shedding bad. It&#x27;s very shiny and thin. Never buying again.</li>
    <li> The only gripe with this wig I have it that the cap is rather small, but all in all it&#x27;s a great quality product!</li>
    <li> I havent worn it too much, but the bangs are kind of long, and i dont like that it feels like a mess when i wear it. what i did tho was I turned it into a dread wig (along with other extentions i rounded up) and it works great because it is long enough. i wouldnt recommend it for someone who seriously wants realistic hair, but it is a fun costume/project wig.</li>
    <li> It was worth the buy. People thought it was real in pictures. I love how it stayed on my head all day long during a cosplay event. It sheds sometimes, but it&#x27;s really nice. I was so happy with it.</li>
    <li> The color of the wig is slightly different from the one in the picture, it&#x27;s a bit darker. But it still looks quite lovely!&lt;br /&gt;This is my first wig and I must say, the quality of the hair is really good. It looks really realistic and soft~&lt;br /&gt;The hair falls out rather easily if you aren&#x27;t too careful, so you have to be ultra gentle! I must say, this is a really good buy, especially because it&#x27;s really affordable. :)</li>
    <li> I remember starting high school by chopping off all my hair. Boy that was a stupid mistake. For the next 9 years, I&#x27;d find myself going with shorter and shorter styles. I eventually gave up hope until recently, when I cut my hair super short and invested in one of these wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits my head perfectly. I even use a wig cap, which makes it more easy to put on, not that you need one, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt for me to recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair I used to hair when I was younger reached past my breasts and now, all I need to do to get that hair back is slip on the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a timely manner and I enjoy starting conversations using this wig.</li>
    <li> okay so I just recently cut my hair to start natural (I am an African American) I ordered the wig on last Friday which was the 17th and got it Tuesday. I was super excited waiting and counting down the days. when I opened the package it came with a pair of socks and a wig cap. Instantly I tried the wig on and it was PERFECT! down to the color. It&#x27;s very full and looks real, a tad shiny but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I wore it to work and no one recognized me and showered me with complements. I&#x27;m so amazed at how soft and real it feels to touch and how easy it is to comb through and YES there is shedding which is in my opinion common with wigs. The price is amazing for such good quality. with that being said I will honorably recommend this to all my girlfriends and also will be buying my wigs from this seller from now on!</li>
    <li> Really good quality for the price, but bangs were way too long, you&#x27;d need a huge forehead for this wig to look right - I had to cut the bangs myself.</li>
    <li> The wig was horrible I give it zero stars</li>
    <li> I AM SO PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE COULD HAVE NOT SPEND MY MONEY ANY BETTER.WAS WRAP NEAT AND ARRIVED WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSE TO.I HAVE PURCHASE OUT OF THE  STORES BUT THIS IS BETTER THAN THOSE.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and a good product</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Comes with a wig cap. It&#x27;s synthetic hair so dont think you&#x27;re going to look 100% natural. It was a bit large for my head but I managed. I put it in a ponytail or braid when I go out so it looks a bit more real. I love the chocolate color. It gets nappy quick so maybe bring a brush with you. You&#x27;ll never know unless you try it yourself.</li>
    <li> This is a really good buy. the quality is fantastic and its very soft. i didnt expect the quality to be this good because of the price but it is.</li>
    <li> Okay so this is the first wig I ever bought online, I have to say it&#x27;s very amazing in texture and colour, having multiple shades of brunette in it. I get compliments on my &#x27;hair&#x27; so that should tell you just how real it looks ^^</li>
    <li> I had a lot of fun with this wig and I fell in love with one.  It is really natural in llok and it is a lot of fun to wear it feel really smooth and soft. I love the feel of the wig.  I want another one.</li>
    <li> Really cool, looks convincing and real. Fam loved it. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Slightly darker than expected, but thats okay. Good quality product for the price! Does need to be trimmed up so you can style it how you like, but I&#x27;ve learned to expect that.</li>
    <li> it was perfect for my cosplay but i wouldn&#x27;t wear it on daily basis. my family and some of my friends did think i grew out my hair or some weird thought of theirs, but you can see the obvious shine in pictures. i absolutely loved it for the cosplay and will wear it for other costumes. for those buying it later, remember to brush it from the bottom upward (i&#x27;ve seen plenty of people trying it the other way around). all in all, it was great :D</li>
    <li> I bought this for a wig party and it looks nothing like it does in the picture. The bangs are cut really awkwardly, and it just looks very costume like. However, the packaging was great and the seller contacted me to update me on the status of the order and when I should expect it. Overall, you get what you pay for and maybe if you feel skilled enough, you can cut the bangs yourself or push them to the side. I am considering pushing the bangs to the side and putting it up into a pony tail.</li>
    <li> The  product arrived in tact and faster than I anticipated. The color was lighter than expected, but its not an ugly wig by far... The hair is soft and truly managable. I am planning to wear this wig occaisionally, but not for everday use. It is certainly long enough to put into one or two long braids. I plan on wearing it in one long ponytail when I wear it. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong ladies. How long the product last will be up to you the buyer. Sometimes people post negative comments saying a particular wig didn&#x27;t last long well, if its just thrown around the house when not in use. What can you really expect? This is a fun wig for those days you want reinvent yourself with out spending an arm and a leg. I read the reviews of others who purchased this same exact wig and now I am posting mine.</li>
    <li> I recieved the wig today. Tryed it on and love it. Its beautiful and long hair. My hair is short I miss having long hair so I got this wig to have longer hair. The only thing I kinda didnt like is the cap size is small for my head. The wig is well worth the purchase and arrived in faster time then estimated in shipping!!! Gotta Love Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Also, i ordered 1, and i was shipped and charged for 3 of them..... I was very dissapointed. And though the hair quality is nice, i cant wear them at all because the wig does not fit.</li>
    <li> Great wig but it sheds. way too long had to cut but the bangs are great. lov the color. will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I do love this wig because it looks like real hair and not the synthetic look. Sadly it doesn&#x27;t have layers so I&#x27;ll be adding layers to it so I can make it look more better realistic looking in terms of everyday wear.</li>
    <li> This sure did turn heads!! Will be purchasing in the future!! That is a promise!! :) great hair at a great and affordable price!</li>
    <li> ok wig. I like the way it looks on would recomend as a costume wig. not for every day wear.</li>
    <li> color was more a red cheshnut not dark brown. it will be ok for a different charactur. but not the one wanted</li>
    <li> In this pic it I black but when it cam it was brown! 😔 and it was tangel ya d poofy and the right hand part is brokin</li>
    <li> Not recommended for adults, tangles way too easily. If purchased to wear for an adult keep your brush handy at the costume party. Very cute but not practical for daily wear. Kids love it!</li>
    <li> this wig is greay but its way too thin i wish it was thicker the wig caps breaking. but it is cutwle</li>
    <li> EWWW The worst wig ever, it shed so much I put it right back in the package and threw it away</li>
    <li> Awesome look... The hair piece looks natural..  great fit too...</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this since it was like $8... I did however expect it to be dark brown and its auburn... More red than brown. I&#x27;ve since cut it to shoulder length and straight across bangs, if you&#x27;re looking for longevity, it&#x27;s just not going to happen with this wig. Good option for costume, or a once or twice use cosplay wig. Other than that, this isn&#x27;t the wig. It&#x27;s better than costume wigs, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Sent me the wrong color gave it tp my sister.. Costume wig</li>
    <li> So I purchased this wig to wear out and just be my hair for the day. When I recieved it, it was well packaged, and very silky. After i put it on, I noticed a lot of loose hairs and good amouts of the hair falling out. I like it, but can&#x27;t stand the long brown hair falling out, and getting everywhere. Good wig, but kind of dissapointing. The free gift was a cheap pair of socks too...</li>
    <li> Cool2day Cute Brown Long Straight Wig Kanekalon DARK BROWN Full Wigs jf010011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t count on it looking anything like the wig in the picture, It might if you are able to cut the bangs yourself other wise its a swoop bangs wig and on me it hits my lower back about 5 inches from my pants(I&#x27;m 5&#x27;9\\&quot;). It&#x27;s very pretty and fun but thinner than expected. I use a round thin bristled brush to comb through and it&#x27;s pretty manageable. I&#x27;m happy with it how ever I knew what I was getting because of the previous reviews. I would recommend this wig for play not every day. :)</li>
    <li> Received it fairly quick. Its a lot darker than the picture, probably more of a black brown. I was ok with the color; what I&#x27;m not to thrilled about is how thin it is. I also had to trim the bangs quite a bit. I also layered it because it is just long and thin. Layering sort of helped it look better but if i wear it it will be in a ponytail with a bandana around the edges so it looks somewhat realistic. You definitely get what you pay for with this one.</li>
    <li> Its cheap you get what you paid for. The only thing is keep your wig brush but the wig is on point other than that.</li>
    <li> This is a very nicely made wig. I bought this to go with a Watchmen Silk Spectre costume and it&#x27;s great! Very soft and silky. Bangs are long so if you have no forehead be warned! lol</li>
    <li> Wig looks absolutely nothing like the picture...it is a front bang wig smh..very big disappointment and it smelled weird when I took it out the box</li>
    <li> I was really very disappointed with the quality of this wig. It&#x27;s very, very thin and the cap is ill-fitting. I have some leftover hair inserts, however, that I think I&#x27;m going to use to try to rescue this poor thing. It&#x27;ll also give it some color depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yeah, sigh. This wig is completely unwearable by itself. Without any modifications, I&#x27;ll need to wear a hat with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ends are nice, however. The shine is crazy on this wig, too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS WIG. It is GORGEOUS. Very high quality for the money and looks amazing on.  It&#x27;s soft and cut in such a beautiful way.  The wig cap that comes with was a nice addition and very useful.  The wig is very comfortable.  I would recommend getting a wig brush with it, because of the length it does tangle. There is some shedding as others have stated but not anything that would be a deterrent to purchase.  I want to wear this all the time.  I would buy another in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> When i bought this wig i was expected a cheap bad wig , so i was very pleased and surprised when i received it. when i first got it , it felt just like human hair and was packaged nicely , i could comb it with a actual brush with little or no shedding , something i did not expect , after the course of a couple weeks it started to frizz up a bit at the ends but it was something  could be fixed with a little cutting . its beem about a month now and i still wear it out in public , it looks like real hair and people dont ask about it , it looks amazing and real , i am so pleased .</li>
    <li> I loved how fast the wig came to my door. However, The wig was a bit thin, Not as thick as the other Wigs That I have ordered. But still, It won&#x27;t stop me from ordering from you guys because you&#x27;ve done such a great job. :)</li>
    <li> Too cheesy, too cheap, too shiny, too shedding, too small of a head cap and also takes way too long to come to your house! And I did not receive a free pair of socks like others said they had received. Don&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> The wig is beautiful, soft, and good looking. I believe this is not a one-time used product. After I wore it, I can hardly brush/comb through the hair that mess up together. Is there a easier way to do it?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a lot of wigs and this one is gorgeous.  I have a small head and it fits, isn&#x27;t too big. And the cut is beautiful. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased with this product! Not only was the price excellent, but the quality I feel was extremely high for the low price. I bought it for my Halloween costume, and it looks like the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s not as long as it seemed in the picture, but I think that&#x27;s purely because of my height. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and it comes to about mid-back for me. I expect on a shorter girl it would fall just like it does on the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller included a wig cap and an additional gift (the cutest pair of socks!), which were such a happy surprise. All in all, very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it...Long and silky...just like real hair.</li>
    <li> I wore this wig for one day, and it became super frizzy. I tried washing it, soaking it, but it didn&#x27;t help :\ However, the color was a nice solid brown, and the length was perfect. The bangs though, gosh, are very annoying. They&#x27;re shorter than my eyes but longer than my eyebrows, which means I can&#x27;t pull it to the side without it bouncing right back and can&#x27;t leave it like that since it gets in the way of my eyes &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> This hair is fantastic!!!! wow. It looks great, the reason i only gave it 4 stars is because it needed a little more hair for the back but other than that it is great!!!</li>
    <li> In theory this could be used as a replacement to real hair, however the wig came in a mess, and when tried to comb it out the hair just fell with it. There large knots that I couldn&#x27;t pull without ripping the wig in half. Very tangled and frizzy and couldn&#x27;t be made. Luckily, I only spent $5, so I payed for what I got.</li>
    <li> Cute but tangles way too much even for one day costume wear it&#x27;s ridiculous</li>
    <li> my daughter loves to wear these wigs from cool2day!  she gets compliments with the different styles she can do with them</li>
    <li> Nothing like the pictures has not drawstrng and it loose the color is horrible and there are not clips in the front so it will stay but. Keep your money it is a waste of time to even look at this. I had to get clips and make a drawstrings and the hairs comes out easy.</li>
    <li> My wig came in good condition. It looked like a wig should and behaved like one. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it was thin-ish.</li>
    <li> The wig looks much lighter than the color in the picture, and it&#x27;s made from all synthetic hair so it looks and feels cheap, like plastic. It looks like shiny barbie doll hair. The only way I can wear it out in public is if I throw a scarf on my head and try to cover up most of it. If you&#x27;re going for that: &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t really afford a decent wig or decent wefts, so this is what I got stuck with&amp;#34; look, then by all means, buy it! But if you&#x27;re looking for the look that&#x27;s more: &amp;#34;I&#x27;m in between hairstyles and I&#x27;m throwing on this not so classy but decent looking wig to get to the end of the week, but I still look sexy&amp;#34; look, save your money and find something else.This is a nasty looking wig and you may make a fool out of yourself in the eyes of the public if you try to put it on and pretend that you&#x27;re not wearing an obvious wig on your head. NOT CUTE! But you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> its smooth, and pretty and whenever i wear it people think it&#x27;s real. It got very knotted after an anime convention but i washed it very easily with the help of shampoo, conditioner , and a bathtub....easiest and smoothest wig to put on and clean... i would buy it over and over again.</li>
    <li> pros:  cons:&lt;br /&gt;soft  gets fluffy at the bottom if you brush it&lt;br /&gt;looks like real hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but as you can see there are more pros than cons and this wig really is worth your money</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful wig. It feels very soft and the color is gorgeous. The color is lighter than I expected but that&#x27;s okay. The wig is long so I trimmed it a bit and it needed some brushing when I removed it from the package. The only con is that it took a long to time to arrive at my house. Overall, it&#x27;s a great wig and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> The bangs are a little uneven and the wig is incredibly thin</li>
    <li> Not as long or full as shown, the girl must me shorter than me im only 5\\&quot;9. but either way its a decent product, watch out though, the hair keeps falling out, but it had a BEAUTIFUL color, and looks amazing and real</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a cosplay I wore to an anime convention last month since I couldn&#x27;t afford one of the more expensive ones. When I received the wig it actually looked better than I had expected, although a bit darker, which was actually good for me. Unfortunately there was quite a bit of fall out while just wearing it but it was especially noticeable/annoying while I was styling it...most of it was probably from my constant tugging... It was a little small so I had to adjust it frequently. Overall it wasn&#x27;t HORRIBLE but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll wear it again.</li>
    <li> The only thing wrong with this wig is it&#x27;s tendency to fray on the ends.  I&#x27;d love to know how to prevent the fraying.  Synthetic wigs have to be repalced so often!</li>
    <li> this wig was amazing for price.&lt;br /&gt;shedding was a slight problem but it didnt tangle as easy.&lt;br /&gt;people complimented me when i wore it out in public for no occasion thinking it was real!&lt;br /&gt;it was darker than i expected almost black but it looked great . arrived early too!</li>
    <li> TThe bangs do not fall right with this wig..... But the hair is silky smooth &amp; soft to the touch... But was not right for me... I&#x27;ve ordered a lot of wigs but this one falls short....</li>
</ol>
