      <li>These derby seem to be slightly better than shark.</li>
      <li>I use a shavette style razor and need to use 1 per shave, but they are cheap and more convenient than having to snap a DE razor.  </li>

      <li>and these are great for single use.</li>
      <li>As economic as they are I am totally satisfied.</li>
      <li>I could probably use 1 for 3 to 5 full shaves, but at .06 cents a piece, every shaves a fresh blade for nothing.</li>
      <li>and you really luck out as they fit in any mailbox</li>
      <li>Product arrived right on time and as described.</li>
      <li>Very satified!</li>
      <li>Sharp-ish, good for doing small jobs.</li>
      <li>I have not had many to compare to but these blades appear pretty sharp.</li>
      <li>I bought into the manly image of shaving with a straight razor.</li>
      <li>You can really control the depth of your cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus:</li>
      <li>I dont think there is a whole lot else to say.</li>
      <li>I would recommend them to everyone who is just started straight shaving.</li>
      <li>much better than some of the other brands i have tried, gives a nice shave and can even last for multiple shaves which is almost unheard of for me</li>
      <li>These are intended as only a stepping stone to a true straight razor, which I have started to use now.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend going to straight razor shaving.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say the same about the most recent ones I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just got this as part of the bundle with Classic Samurai CS-102 purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The blades look like they had spilled out of the package and been shoved back in and the paper wrappers were partially open on many of them.</li>
      <li>Nice quality, a hard to find in stores product.</li>
      <li>I could try other brands but these work fine and serve my purpose.</li>
      <li>Can get a second shave from them but a third starts to decline pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>Dulls quick</li>
      <li>These new blades were more dull than any of the blades I had reused repeatedly.</li>
      <li>These are super sharp.</li>
      <li>I only use the straight razor now for shaping my beard now.</li>
      <li>Cheap enough I can change every other time.</li>
      <li>I have only used shark blades , i wanted to try a new brand.</li>
      <li>On another note, I had a similar issue with my traditional straight razors before switching to these as well.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says, very sharp, edge lasts all the way through to the end of the shave.</li>
      <li>Very sharp and work really well.</li>
      <li>Which blades people like tend to really vary by person, and I find these to be a little scratchy.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ll probably look into other blades, and may come back to these.  </li>
<li> Amazingly sharp.</li>
<li> These blades are plenty sharp, I&#x27;ll give them that, but it takes 4-5 blades to shave my head and 2 to shave my face.  </li>

<li> you are going to have a bad time</li>
<li> /&gt;Think it is made in Turkey and if it has anything to do with the bad quality.</li>
<li> but it is annoying to need to change the blades throughout a shave.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very sharp and well packed.</li>
    <li> Really amazing product, can do beyond what I paid.</li>
    <li> Love these blades ! Great price good on delivery fast</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy these. I bought a 100 pack of these 2 years ago and they were great blades. I can&#x27;t say the same about the most recent ones I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades look like they had spilled out of the package and been shoved back in and the paper wrappers were partially open on many of them. When I tried to shave with them it felt like I was shaving with a dollar store pocket knife. Previously, I had used Derby blades for up to 4 shaves before they became unusable. These new blades were more dull than any of the blades I had reused repeatedly. Derby has lost a customer.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and work really well.</li>
    <li> Very satified! Will buy again from them.</li>
    <li> The razors were already opened and it looks like the packaging on one of the razor blades was opened as well .  I now have to discard them all because I cannot use them on my skin. Especially knowing that they have been tampered with.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, a hard to find in stores product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with these blades, i&#x27;m new with straight shaving and as far as i know these are perfect for me. Since i&#x27;m getting the hang of it i don&#x27;t need the sharpest blade because of the cuts, so i prefer these and they are very good for my needs. I would recommend them to everyone who is just started straight shaving.</li>
    <li> much better than some of the other brands i have tried, gives a nice shave and can even last for multiple shaves which is almost unheard of for me (my beard is thick and ruins blades).</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says, very sharp, edge lasts all the way through to the end of the shave. (Even after a weeks growth) would buy again.</li>
    <li> Product arrived right on time and as described. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Theses work great. they cut cleanly and smoothly, and are durable. very good! These are each wrapped, so it is protected.</li>
    <li> I have not had many to compare to but these blades appear pretty sharp. Do a great job first use. Can get a second shave from them but a third starts to decline pretty quickly.  As economic as they are I am totally satisfied. I ordered a box of these Derby razors when I ordered my razor. My razor came with 5 Shark blades and both seemed to be comparable. I could try other brands but these work fine and serve my purpose. These are intended as only a stepping stone to a true straight razor, which I have started to use now. These will be used for times when I travel. I highly recommend going to straight razor shaving.  Don&#x27;t think you will regret it. Great savings after the initial cost.</li>
    <li> Cheap enough I can change every other time. Always a good shave. $5 for a year of blades is awesome</li>
    <li> These blades are plenty sharp, I&#x27;ll give them that, but it takes 4-5 blades to shave my head and 2 to shave my face.  I don&#x27;t know if this is because the batch I received was a bad batch of if this is the general consistency but it is annoying to need to change the blades throughout a shave.  On another note, I had a similar issue with my traditional straight razors before switching to these as well.</li>
    <li> These blades are a great deal. I shave with a straight edge (best shave you can get) and these are great for single use. Do the math $8-9 gets you 100 shaves for about .80-.90 cents a shave. Add prime to it and you really luck out as they fit in any mailbox so no need to pick them up or fuss. Easy win!</li>
    <li> very happy with these razors. I have only used shark blades , i wanted to try a new brand. These derby seem to be slightly better than shark. I dont think there is a whole lot else to say. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I think these blades are alright.  I use a shavette style razor and need to use 1 per shave, but they are cheap and more convenient than having to snap a DE razor.  I&#x27;ll probably look into other blades, and may come back to these.  Which blades people like tend to really vary by person, and I find these to be a little scratchy.</li>
    <li> Nice 3 shaves with one razor</li>
    <li> I bought into the manly image of shaving with a straight razor. Unfortunately my face did not approve. I bought the 100 count cause the price was so good. I only use the straight razor now for shaping my beard now. I may never use all these blades.</li>
    <li> Good razors and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and perfect</li>
    <li> These are super sharp. You can really control the depth of your cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: Great for shaving faces and stuff too.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus bonus: Great for challenging emo kids to finally nut up or shut up.</li>
    <li> this razor blades are very small if you plan to use them in a Shavette you are going to have a bad time</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Dulls quick</li>
    <li> Nope. Tiger blades work way better. These are nicky as anything.</li>
    <li> Sharp-ish, good for doing small jobs. For example you can fix side burns or do the edge on your goatee. Don&#x27;t recommend this for actually shaving the face. Could spend your money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Just got this as part of the bundle with Classic Samurai CS-102 purchase. Sorry but the blade is dull. Nothing else to say. I have traveled a bit and this blade&#x27;s quality is similar to the ones used in barber shops in  some non industrialized  countries. Not nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think it is made in Turkey and if it has anything to do with the bad quality. If anybody has recommendation for a American or European made blade please comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. Love this brand!</li>
    <li> My second brand, and now probably my only brand. Amazingly sharp. I could probably use 1 for 3 to 5 full shaves, but at .06 cents a piece, every shaves a fresh blade for nothing.</li>
