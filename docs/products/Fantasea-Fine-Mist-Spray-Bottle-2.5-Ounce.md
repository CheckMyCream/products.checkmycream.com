### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are perfect for travel!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, if you just need them to spray water, they&#x27;re awesome.</li>
      <li>These bottles work beautifully for about a day and then the pump sticks and stops working.  </li>
      <li>3 out of four of the bottles spray great</li>
      <li>Amazing quality!</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>It works fine and was a great price.</li>
      <li>If you need to be able to control the heaviness of mist, or to apply color to art, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I find many uses for them.</li>
      <li>Produce a fine mist ...</li>
      <li>There is nothing fine or mist-like about the liquid coming out of these bottles.</li>
      <li>In the first 10 sprays, the springs in each spray bottle got stuck so you have to manually lift the top to fill it with liquid to spray.</li>
      <li>Great little bottles for travel, good capacity, no leaks, nice wide spray.  </li>
      <li>Work great as expected.</li>
      <li>For other uses, these bottles are great.</li>
      <li>I received in quick time just what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>Nice basic bottles.</li>
      <li>Not the finest mist, but still very much a mist as opposed to a spray.</li>
      <li>Prompt delivery and exactly what we needed.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised and shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>If you want these bottles just to provide a general delivery of dissipated liquid, they&#x27;re fine.</li>
      <li>It comes out in large droplets,that in no way define the concept of &amp;#34;mist.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had to wait about a month to receive these in the mail, and they definitely weren&#x27;t worth the wait.  </li>
      <li>so far every sprayer has worked and none of the bottles have leaked.</li>
      <li>months later, one of the misters quit working completely, and another I have to baby (clean carefully after each use) for it to function.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Buy more than what you will need in case some are broken.</li>
      <li>Since I got them specifically to be able to spray a fine mist, they&#x27;re worthless.</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
<li> not worth a penny!!!</li>
<li> /&gt;These are not good craft bottles.</li>
<li> However, if you&#x27;re using them to provide gradient coloring in artwork, they&#x27;re poor quality.</li>
<li> Judging from the other reviews maybe I got a bad batch.  </li>
<li> These are awful.</li>

    <li> Amazing quality! Very pleased with this product. I find many uses for them.</li>
    <li> These bottles work beautifully for about a day and then the pump sticks and stops working.  I had to wait about a month to receive these in the mail, and they definitely weren&#x27;t worth the wait.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Clear bottles are not ideal for products containing essential oils, because sunlight will break down the oils. For other uses, these bottles are great. I make herb infused oils and put them in these bottles to use as salad spritzer. so far every sprayer has worked and none of the bottles have leaked.</li>
    <li> Judging from the other reviews maybe I got a bad batch.  None of the ones I ordered spray, they all squirt a stream of liquid.  Since I got them specifically to be able to spray a fine mist, they&#x27;re worthless.</li>
    <li> bought pack of 4 and 1 doesnt spray. Buy more than what you will need in case some are broken.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> If you want these bottles just to provide a general delivery of dissipated liquid, they&#x27;re fine. However, if you&#x27;re using them to provide gradient coloring in artwork, they&#x27;re poor quality. There is nothing fine or mist-like about the liquid coming out of these bottles. They don&#x27;t mist; they spray liquid. It comes out in large droplets,that in no way define the concept of &amp;#34;mist.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, if you just need them to spray water, they&#x27;re awesome.

    <li> Not the finest mist, but still very much a mist as opposed to a spray. I use it to mist my paints as I work and it keeps them from getting tacky without diluting them.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for travel!</li>
    <li> Nice basic bottles. Work great as expected.</li>
    <li> not worth a penny!!! And shipping took forever!</li>
    <li> Great little bottles for travel, good capacity, no leaks, nice wide spray.  Bought a second set.</li>
    <li> Produce a fine mist ...I use them for rubbing alcohol for monitors, TV&#x27;s and eye glasses</li>
    <li> I received in quick time just what I ordered.  It works fine and was a great price.</li>
    <li> These are awful. I purchased a pack of 4 spray bottles, and none of them work properly. In the first 10 sprays, the springs in each spray bottle got stuck so you have to manually lift the top to fill it with liquid to spray. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> 3 out of four of the bottles spray great the other one is so so.</li>
    <li> 3 out of 4 quit working within a week.  Not worth the money</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and exactly what we needed.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Sprayed out in a single stream, no mist.</li>
