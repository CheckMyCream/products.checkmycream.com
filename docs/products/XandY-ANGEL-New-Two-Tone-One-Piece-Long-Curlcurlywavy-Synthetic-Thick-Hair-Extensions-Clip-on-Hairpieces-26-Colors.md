      <li>Going to buy another one for sure.</li>
      <li>The ombre looks so much better in person</li>
      <li>I love the ombr&amp;eacute; look.</li>

      <li>I am very excited to wear this extension.</li>
      <li>but they look pretty good.</li>
      <li>I loved it for the first 3 weeks or so</li>
      <li>I was worried at first bc of some of the reviews on the other color extensions but this blends perfectly with my hair, they look so good</li>
      <li>Very good quality actually, silky shiny hair</li>
      <li>I love it and although it did not match my hair the colors are fantastic.</li>
      <li>and these could rival them easily</li>
      <li>But all the colors and measurements are accurate.</li>
      <li>It is also comfortable.</li>
      <li>but when I got them, they were way too light in color.</li>
      <li>this was nice, didn&#x27;t really go with my hair, but that was my fault.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this</li>
      <li>definitely worth it for the price!</li>
      <li>love it so much.</li>
      <li>It clips on easily and blends in really well.</li>
      <li>but it looks so real!!</li>
      <li>These are so pretty!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise amazing product especially for price but be prepared to wait a bit for them</li>
      <li>It might be cheap but the quality was very unexpected.</li>
      <li>Great thick hair that can handle heat</li>
      <li>(i dyed my hair lighter since then) and they looked pretty real too!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>I love it ,and it was so soft,just like human hair.</li>
      <li>They matched my hair color really well when I first got them</li>
      <li>/&gt;Texture of this set is soft - softer than some human hair extensions I own, and is a generous thick weft (my own hair is long and fine).&lt;br /&gt;After bit of fiddling with clip-ins slight curling of my own hair and A LOT of brushing, this can pass for the real thing and blends nicely into a waist-long ombre mane.</li>
      <li>It is a large clip in.</li>
      <li>and so real</li>
      <li>Came fast</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>I was very I presssed.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t melt or anything, they just turn super straight and won&#x27;t go back to curly.</li>
      <li>own several sets of extensions for different purposes - human hair and synthetic sets in variety of colors.</li>
      <li>I have used many hair extensions in the past but have never seen an ombr&amp;eacute; look before.</li>
      <li>four was more than enough for very thick full weave</li>
      <li>I think it can pass for natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They are pretty long.</li>
      <li>They are not real hair though and they don&#x27;t feel like real hair</li>

<li> They are not real hair though and they don&#x27;t feel like real hair</li>
<li> While I was hoping that brown part of this set will be a little lighter to blend in as &amp;#34;outgrown ombre roots&amp;#34; with my strawberry blonde-to-ash blonde hair, and this is a rather dark brown - it does blend very nicely.&lt;br</li>
<li> They are pretty uncomfortable though and it&#x27;s kind of hard to cover the clips them unless you have really thick hair.</li>
<li> but then it started to get knotted and messy; you should get it but take care of it; it is heavy at first</li>
<li> but you can easily breakdown into smaller tracks by cutting them to size you like</li>
<li> am going back to order this set in a bit brighter naughty color for masquerades and balls.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t wear them and I have wasted my money apparently</li>
<li> They look fake at first</li>
<li> The ad said brown to blonde, it was actually dirty blonde to blonde.</li>
<li> And it might have just been my postal services that slowed down the order.</li>
<li> The only bad thing I have to say about this product is that I wish you could strighten them or had a straight version.</li>
<li> Too heavy.</li>
<li> but if you want to wear a few it&#x27;s too thick and heavy</li>
<li> well looks very natural but the only reason I gve it four is because the tracks are about three inches thick which isn&#x27;t awful</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had some very very expensive ones over $600</li>

    <li> This clip-in was awesome! I was so impressed with the hair quailty as well as the weft construction. And the colour is so perfect.</li>
    <li> I was worried at first bc of some of the reviews on the other color extensions but this blends perfectly with my hair, they look so good and so real I was very I presssed. I straightened them and they didn&#x27;t fry. Going to buy another one for sure. Looks good, cheap price. I highly recommend it!! Also the shipping said it would take forever and I recieved them the following week!</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Came pre curled and has about five to six clips. It is a large clip in. It is perfect for me!</li>
    <li> Very good quality actually, silky shiny hair</li>
    <li> Great piece!  It clips on easily and blends in really well. It is also comfortable.</li>
    <li> I love the ombr&amp;eacute; look. I have used many hair extensions in the past but have never seen an ombr&amp;eacute; look before. I am very excited to wear this extension.</li>
    <li> this was nice, didn&#x27;t really go with my hair, but that was my fault. definitely worth it for the price!</li>
    <li> The quality of this is awesome. It might be cheap but the quality was very unexpected. I will buy more. Matches my hair perfectly. It&#x27;s not as ombré as the picture looks.</li>
    <li> Loved the color and quality!&lt;br /&gt;I own several sets of extensions for different purposes - human hair and synthetic sets in variety of colors. While I was hoping that brown part of this set will be a little lighter to blend in as &amp;#34;outgrown ombre roots&amp;#34; with my strawberry blonde-to-ash blonde hair, and this is a rather dark brown - it does blend very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Texture of this set is soft - softer than some human hair extensions I own, and is a generous thick weft (my own hair is long and fine).&lt;br /&gt;After bit of fiddling with clip-ins slight curling of my own hair and A LOT of brushing, this can pass for the real thing and blends nicely into a waist-long ombre mane.

    <li> Awesome  looks like natural hair!!!</li>
    <li> looks great on, looks very eral gives my hair a great glow. love it so much. thanks. order again soon</li>
    <li> Beautiful!!!! Would totally recommend!! You definitely need two if you have thicker hair but it looks so real!!</li>
    <li> Omg these are amazing I&#x27;ve had some very very expensive ones over $600 and these could rival them easily I would say 3 to 4 of these pieces is perfect there a beautiful curl and color . I also use foxy locks and these are a great alternative and those are about $170. These are $8 a piece seriously amazing. Came fast</li>
    <li> I like these extensions. They matched my hair color really well when I first got them (i dyed my hair lighter since then) and they looked pretty real too! They are pretty long. They are not real hair though and they don&#x27;t feel like real hair but they look pretty good. They are pretty uncomfortable though and it&#x27;s kind of hard to cover the clips them unless you have really thick hair. I have another set of synthetic hair extensions and I can curl and straighten them on low heat but these ones I can&#x27;t. They don&#x27;t melt or anything, they just turn super straight and won&#x27;t go back to curly. But the color is nice and for the price they are good!</li>
    <li> Too heavy. hurt after an hour of wearing it.</li>
    <li> These are so pretty! The ombre looks so much better in person then it does in the picture. The curls were beautiful. The only bad thing I have to say about this product is that I wish you could strighten them or had a straight version.</li>
    <li> The product is nice. I really like it ^^ The only problem was that the shipping took over a month to get to me. It&#x27;s still a great product. And it might have just been my postal services that slowed down the order. I recommend this. It is a good price.</li>
    <li> The extensions are great. They look fake at first but after you brush them a couple of times they look better. But all the colors and measurements are accurate.</li>
    <li> I loved it for the first 3 weeks or so but then it started to get knotted and messy; you should get it but take care of it; it is heavy at first but u have to get used to it</li>
