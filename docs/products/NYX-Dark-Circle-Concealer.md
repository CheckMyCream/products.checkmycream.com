### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the greatest coverage.</li>
      <li>Very happy.</li>
      <li>This is the best concealer I have tried.  </li>
      <li>but when I saw the difference it made with this one I could tell it was a good product!</li>
      <li>a great buy- hope it is not discontinued.</li>
      <li>Yes, I agree that the texture is creamier which is nice for under the eyes but the Orange Concealer does the trick just as well!</li>
      <li>I got beige which has an orange tink but don&#x27;t let it deceive you if your fairly tan.</li>
      <li>Doesnt have a good coverage</li>
      <li>Love love this cover up!!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Good seller tho :)</li>
      <li>Affordable and effective.</li>
      <li>and I was kinda hesitant because when I opened it, it seemed kind of orange.</li>
      <li>&amp; I absolutely love</li>
      <li>x&#x27;s more product.</li>
      <li>I recommend this while you find a better product.</li>
      <li>Maybe if I had a better concealer</li>
      <li>Just make sure to warm up the orange concealer with your fingers &amp; apply sparingly, apply foundation on top &amp; your normal lighter concealer over that if you wish.</li>
      <li>Creases easily and not advisable if you have fine lines that it can accentuate.</li>
      <li>The best product for dark circles.</li>
      <li>The best product I have used to cover up dark circles and hide any blemishes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d much rather get good results from a high end product, than throw money away.  </li>
      <li>but I can still see some greyness after applying my Normal concealer on top.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works on my dark circles,i thought all the reviews were just too good to be true.</li>
      <li>It is a good product but doesn&#x27;t give the coverage I expected.</li>
      <li>other than that, good product.</li>
      <li>Not as amazing as expected.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly my skin color</li>
      <li>The color does work for dark circles nicely.</li>
      <li>This NYX concealer (in DCC03-medium) does a great job of covering dark undereye circles while blending into my skin (w/o additional makeup), staying on (given my oily eyelids, and southern heat/humidity), AND its inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This really does cancel out blue/brown tones under the eyes.</li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This orange based concealer works very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a medium skin tone, NW30 and thought this would be the right color for me.&lt;br /&gt;It works, but I ordered the Light just to make sure I got the wrong color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Philosophy concealer doesn&#x27;t migrate into fine lines or cake, even when set with loose powder and it stays put all day.  </li>
      <li>Live and learn.  </li>
      <li>Okay so I got it earlier than expected which is a plus</li>
      <li>It is ok ,is a little dry and does not cover much.</li>
      <li>BareMinerals is the only product line I&#x27;ve found that decently matches, but the concealer didn&#x27;t have the staying power.  </li>
      <li>So although I only use one side, I still really like the product and would recommend spending the money for it over trying this NYX concealer, which has barely any orange tint to it at all.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply and does not have a thick feel on my skin.  </li>
      <li>then i use this and use bare minerals well rested to set it.</li>
      <li>The product does not cover the dark circles very well.</li>
      <li>I find that it&#x27;s a little cakey if you apply too much.</li>

<li> My skin is light, but not fair, but I needed the Philosophy product in medium because the orange was dark enough to neutralize the blue discoloration.  </li>
<li> The beige side is far too dark for me.  </li>
<li> A complete waste of my money.</li>
<li> is the same as any other concealer.</li>
<li> This corrector is not orange enough to cover my hereditary dark bluish under eye circles.  </li>
<li> usually the undertones are off, so the makeup does not look natural.</li>
<li> and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t help correct dark circles</li>
<li> if you are expecting a miracle concealer for dark circles, then no this is not the product.  </li>
<li> My job consists of dark circles because of the lack of sleep I get</li>
<li> just be cuz it says DARK CIRCLE CONCEALER</li>
<li> The Orange Concealer is about $2 less &amp; you get 3, maybe 4</li>
<li> it covers those dark circles for a few hours</li>
<li> but why pay even a little bit for something that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> I have very dark purplish pigment on my eyelids and under my eyes.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s still $$ wasted.  </li>
<li> I have a hard time finding products (both drugstore and prestige brands) that match my medium indian skin-</li>
<li> I have very dark circles, when i put this cover up on they are gone!!</li>
<li> Very small.</li>
<li> my dark circles are bad like a 7</li>
<li> and I have used expensive concealer</li>
<li> It blended well and didn&#x27;t cake, but these two facts are offset by the bad job it did at concealing my circles.  </li>
<li> It covers all the imperfections I hate.</li>
<li> Horrible Concealer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best product for dark circles. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I got this in Medium because I am medium skin toned &amp; I absolutely love it covers those dark circles for a few hours</li>
    <li> This corrector is not orange enough to cover my hereditary dark bluish under eye circles.  I was surprised at how beige it is compared to other brands I&#x27;ve used.  It did absolutely nothing.  It blended well and didn&#x27;t cake, but these two facts are offset by the bad job it did at concealing my circles.  I&#x27;ve also tried Laura Mercier, Bobbi Brown, Napoleon Perdis and Philosophy.  The only product that works for me is the Philosophy concealer duo in medium and I only use the orange side of it.  My skin is light, but not fair, but I needed the Philosophy product in medium because the orange was dark enough to neutralize the blue discoloration.  The beige side is far too dark for me.  So although I only use one side, I still really like the product and would recommend spending the money for it over trying this NYX concealer, which has barely any orange tint to it at all.  The Philosophy concealer doesn&#x27;t migrate into fine lines or cake, even when set with loose powder and it stays put all day.  I know it&#x27;s more expensive than NYX but why pay even a little bit for something that doesn&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s still $$ wasted.  I&#x27;d much rather get good results from a high end product, than throw money away.  My NYX concealer is gathering dust in my bathroom drawer, where the things I don&#x27;t use go to die.  Live and learn.  I will stick with Philosophy thank you.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Very small.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Arrived in a day and I use it all the time. It covers all the imperfections I hate.</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer I have tried.  I have very dark purplish pigment on my eyelids and under my eyes.  This orange based concealer works very well.</li>
    <li> It actually does make a noticeable difference like big difference but I can still see some greyness after applying my Normal concealer on top. Maybe if I had a better concealer it&#x27;d work. I still use it on a daily basis bc my dark circles are bad like a 7 but w this its a 3. Doesn&#x27;t cake up. I recommend this while you find a better product.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t anything that I hoped it would be. It&#x27;s not creamy and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t help correct dark circles</li>
    <li> Okay so I got it earlier than expected which is a plus and I was kinda hesitant because when I opened it, it seemed kind of orange. My job consists of dark circles because of the lack of sleep I get and I have used expensive concealer but when I saw the difference it made with this one I could tell it was a good product! I got beige which has an orange tink but don&#x27;t let it deceive you if your fairly tan. I love it!</li>
    <li> The best product I have used to cover up dark circles and hide any blemishes.  Easy to apply and does not have a thick feel on my skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It is a good product but doesn&#x27;t give the coverage I expected.</li>
    <li> Doesnt have a good coverage</li>
    <li> Not as amazing as expected.</li>
    <li> if you are expecting a miracle concealer for dark circles, then no this is not the product.  is the same as any other concealer. other than that, good product.</li>
    <li> Horrible Concealer. Hid nothing, did nothing, looked like I didn&#x27;t put anything on. A complete waste of my money. DO NOT BUY THIS &amp;#34;CONCEALER&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a medium skin tone, NW30 and thought this would be the right color for me.&lt;br /&gt;It works, but I ordered the Light just to make sure I got the wrong color.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the greatest coverage. But I&#x27;m solely using this for the color correction, following it with a yellow/neutral concealer and then setting it. But if you&#x27; a shade or 2 darker than me, this would probably work for you. It&#x27;s exactly my skin color so, I&#x27;ll be experimenting.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding products (both drugstore and prestige brands) that match my medium indian skin- usually the undertones are off, so the makeup does not look natural. BareMinerals is the only product line I&#x27;ve found that decently matches, but the concealer didn&#x27;t have the staying power.  This NYX concealer (in DCC03-medium) does a great job of covering dark undereye circles while blending into my skin (w/o additional makeup), staying on (given my oily eyelids, and southern heat/humidity), AND its inexpensive.  Overall a great buy- hope it is not discontinued.</li>
    <li> It is ok ,is a little dry and does not cover much.</li>
    <li> Love love this cover up!! I have very dark circles, when i put this cover up on they are gone!! Very happy.</li>
    <li> Creases easily and not advisable if you have fine lines that it can accentuate. The color does work for dark circles nicely.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars is be cuz of the amount you receive. You get about a quarter of the amount just be cuz it says DARK CIRCLE CONCEALER, are you kidding me?! Yes, I agree that the texture is creamier which is nice for under the eyes but the Orange Concealer does the trick just as well! Just make sure to warm up the orange concealer with your fingers &amp; apply sparingly, apply foundation on top &amp; your normal lighter concealer over that if you wish. The Orange Concealer is about $2 less &amp; you get 3, maybe 4 x&#x27;s more product. Maybe I&#x27;m just too froogle.</li>
    <li> Product is so so.. Prob won&#x27;t but again. Good seller tho :)</li>
    <li> The product does not cover the dark circles very well.</li>
    <li> This really does cancel out blue/brown tones under the eyes. I find that it&#x27;s a little cakey if you apply too much. It lasts almost all day, but does crease. I find that just smoothing  the area will even it out again.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Ulta for $5.99&lt;br /&gt;It works on my dark circles,i thought all the reviews were just too good to be true. It really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I use under eye primer by smash box then i use this and use bare minerals well rested to set it. This concealer doesn&#x27;t leave a grey&lt;br /&gt;cast under eye. I truly like it. Affordable and effective.</li>
