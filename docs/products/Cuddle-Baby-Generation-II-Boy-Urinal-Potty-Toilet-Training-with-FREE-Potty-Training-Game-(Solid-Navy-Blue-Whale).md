<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pretty good buy. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I purchased 6 different sets of bows from Amazon when I found out I was pregnant with a girl. These tied for my second favorites. They look just like the picture and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I just didn&#x27;t like how big they are, but hopefully when she gets bigger these will work. I have yet to use one on her because it looks ridiculous on a tiny baby.</li>
    <li> The colors are vibrant. The poof is just a little big for my liking.</li>
    <li> I love these headbands!</li>
    <li> I like the laser print lace flower.  The size is large and it looks pretty. My red band broke and I doubt we&#x27;ll ever use the brown or black flowers but besides that it was a good buy for the selection and price. I haven&#x27;t needed any other headband since buying these.</li>
    <li> Just got them in! Super early soooo happy about that! And they look great. I even got all the same colors. My princess isn&#x27;t here yet so dont know if they&#x27;ll fit her little head yet,  but it looks like they will!  Very pleased! :)</li>
    <li> I liked the product but the flower seems smaller in the picture, actually is bigger than it looks like in the picture so when I put it on my baby&#x60;s head it looks giant!. Besides that I really liked it.</li>
    <li> Good quality, super cute, a rainbow of colors. Fit my baby at 8 months, 12 months, and I expect will continue to fit for the next year at least. Very stretchy, but good hold.</li>
    <li> Super cute but REALLY small!! My daughter only has a 30% head score and they are so small I ended up cutting all the ribbons off and just using the flowers with new ribbons. So unless your daughter is a newborn with a small head...</li>
    <li> I love it but came with 2 green instead the black one.</li>
    <li> Great deal and they&#x27;re super cute.</li>
    <li> I was alittle nervous opening it. They seemed to be smashed together, but the sprung to life and just needed alil fluffing. They are soo adorable. Good product for price!</li>
    <li> These headbands are super soft and adorable! The color choice is amazing, and I am so excited to use them once my little girl gets here!</li>
    <li> Love them all look exactly like picture</li>
    <li> Very well made that I end up buying another set for my Niece, since she love them.  Price is very afortable.  Much cheaper that if you buy them a t the baby store.  I recomend</li>
    <li> Really cute headbands. These were suggested to me from a friend who bought them for her baby girl so I bought them for my niece who is a few weeks old. They are a little big on her now but she will grow into them. I love the wide range of colors. These arrived much faster than the estimated ship date. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit newborn head so I had to alter it. However I love them!</li>
    <li> Lovely unusual colors that every girl should have to match every outfit. And also great price</li>
    <li> Awesome!! My one year old loves them</li>
    <li> Got just what I expected. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I ordered another set of headbands from another seller and they were gigantic on my newborn daughter.  Her head is 14&amp;#34; and these are a perfect fit. She gets so many compliments on how cute she looks wearing these brightly colored accessories.</li>
    <li> Smaller fit, but my baby looks adorable in them! Such a great product and price.</li>
    <li> so cute (: love these headbands, love all the colors &amp; was surprised that i received them in a week.</li>
    <li> I recive those beautiful headbands pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;I love them a lot, they are perfect size for my 3 month old baby.</li>
    <li> The band material is not as stretchy as you would want for a baby. It leaves a mark on her soft little head that i don&#x27;t appreciate.</li>
    <li> Shipping was slow. Came from China. But arrived in individual plastic so each one arrived fluffy and us damaged. Worth the wait for the great price! They have a slight sheen to most the colors, very beautiful! I haven&#x27;t decided if I&#x27;m going to cut off the elastic and attach to an alligator clip for my daughter because headbands send to pop off her head just they do on me lol. Very nice size as well! I thought they were around two in a half inches but I think they are closer to 3.5 which is the perfect size IMO for a baby toddler and young little girls :)</li>
    <li> My granddaughter  Adria will Love to wear different color daily with outfit . The price is reasonable to get it for either own baby girl or gift .  I am really happy this product  .</li>
    <li> Really cute. Kind of big flower. Not currently using, she is 4 months.. but she will grow into.</li>
    <li> Love these headbands! They&#x27;re big and cute! I was worried a bit that they might be too tight on my 6 months old head, but they&#x27;re perfect and fit fine. Not cheapy made at all. 11$ well spent!</li>
    <li> Gigantic flower or super-girly girls. We chopped the &amp;#34;petals&amp;#34; down to make them a little less ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I have used one of these bows with all of my daughters outfits pretty much since the day she was born. They fit great and the band is made of astretchy material. I am so glad that this came with pretty much every color bow. I have used for formal wear and casual wear and they truly complement the beautiful face of a baby or young girl.</li>
    <li> Cute headbands and they are a good fit too. Not too tight to where it would leave red marks. She only wore it for about 20 mins before pulling it off though lol.( she is almost 10 months old) the only complaint I would have is the circle cutouts that fall off when first receiving the package. Not a big deal though, I just shook them and vaccumed up the material. I love all the bright colors!</li>
    <li> I just LOVE these headbands. Shipping was fast. They are the perfect sized flower. Not too big. And all the color choices you get are amazing. Definitely would buy again</li>
    <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the yellow flower has an orange band</li>
    <li> They fit my 8 month old daughter perfectly with a little extra room.</li>
    <li> I love the headbands!!! the flower is perfect size and exactly what I wanted! I love the skinny band as well.</li>
    <li> These were a really good deal, considering how many I got, but they are for kids not babies, unless your baby has a huge head. They are really bright as well so if you want something not so bright theses are not for you. That being said, they are sturdy, and fit my 5 year old great!</li>
    <li> I was kinda scared that these would not be cute since they are such a good deakl but they are super cute! love them</li>
    <li> These are pretty good.  They fit my 8 week old well with lots of room to grow.  I like the headband part it is stretchy and a good width and the flowers are pretty cute-- a little big for my taste but still cute.  I was a bit annoyed that the bright pink flower came without a headband attached to it (and this is the most common color in her wardrobe!) and some of the colors aren&#x27;t very useful (brown, orange, black) but for the price it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> soft and comfortable around my baby girl&#x27;s head and it stays put! The flowers are soft in texture and in vibrant colors. I wished they came in darker shades of blue and purple instead of brown and black. We get tons of compliments whenever we are out and about and it doesn&#x27;t leave a mark when it&#x27;s time to take it off.</li>
    <li> These are so different and my nice looks so cute in them I love how her mother matches her outfits with the hair band of the day LOL</li>
    <li> These are adorable and such fun colors! I was pleasantly surprised by their quality too. I highly recommend them to anyone!</li>
    <li> These bows are adorable. I ordered them for my 4 month old they are a little big but she will grow into them. They came crammed in a small bag but I just fluffed them and they shaped right up. I caught them on sale 5 bucks with free shipping total score.</li>
    <li> I got these for my two year old daughter and they are just great. The price was good considering in the stores you normally get only 1 for the price I paid for 11. The colors are true to the colors of clothing little girls normally wear. I really like them and the shipping was not as long as expected!</li>
    <li> I love this headbands. I now have every color for my baby! Great Buy! Will recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> These are amazing and the price is awesome...these are a must have for every parent of an infant girl...perfect for any occasion</li>
    <li> I love em all as seen on pic</li>
    <li> Wonderful colours , nice cloth. Band is so strong and elastic. But its somewhat smaller for my 4 year daughter.  It gives awesome look. Flower is not too big and not too small.</li>
    <li> Very happy I purchased these!! They are a great quality and will look precious with anything! They will also be great to travel with b/c they take back to shape immediately!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 5 month old daughter.  These are made of such nice quality and the color range is perfect for all of her little outfits..  They shipped super fast and I get compliments all the time!</li>
    <li> I love them they are perfect, and well done finish I totally recommend itand they look pretty cute, and good quality.</li>
    <li> Love these - they come in so many colors and are soft.  They don&#x27;t make indents on baby&#x27;s head like so many others.  They are cute and vibrantly colored.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for a 1 yr old without it being TOO big. The cut out detailing on the bow makes it cute and unique.</li>
    <li> Love them.  We get compliments and inquiries every time our 4mo old wears one of these headbands.  The only drawback is some of the colors aren&#x27;t very wearable (lime green on a baby???), but for this price it doesn&#x27;t matter.  It&#x27;s an incredible value.</li>
    <li> super super cute headbands!! good quality, great price!! the colors are awesome and flowers are perfect!! highly reccomend getting these for ANY baby girl!</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned when they first arrived that they would be squished since they are all stuffed into a small package, but once taken out and fluffed up a bit, they come out perfectly. They are super cute and fit both my 6 month old and 2 year old very well. The colors are also very vibrant. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I got this for my friend and while they are very cute, the quality is okay. She told me that a couple of the flowers have detached from the headband but she was able to sew them back on.</li>
    <li> These headbands are so cute and definately worth the price.  The colors are true to the ones shown on the computer.  Very satisfied and highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> perfect size, lots of colors, these are great for the price but will take a while to get to your house, plan accordingly.</li>
    <li> These look great and fit her head perfectly, but half of them did not survive the first time through the wash.</li>
    <li> These headbands are very pretty. Beautiful vibrant colors true to the picture. Some of the flowers were flattened in the package, but I fluffed them up a little and that was all it needed. Shipping was pretty fast considering they came from China, only took about 9 days for delivery.</li>
    <li> Great my little 3 year old loves wearing head bows so these are wonderful and a great price she has so many which gives great choices so these were a wonderful addition to her collection</li>
    <li> They are good quality for the $$ and they look so adorable on my little girl. Perfect size flower too :) I am going to order more for my friends new baby girls.</li>
    <li> I love this set!! These are the only elastic headbands I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t leave a mark on my daughter&#x27;s head. She is 8 months old and the headbands fit perfectly. The elastic has a lot of give, which makes me think these will fit for a while! The only downside is that the cutouts on the flower part of the headband are still attached and randomly fall off. They get all over the place. This doesn&#x27;t affect the look of the headband though. Just a minor inconvenience. Overall, this is an awesome set for the price!</li>
    <li> I love these bows and the colors are beautiful. Now my granddaughter has a bow for every outfit and they are so worth the price you pay.</li>
    <li> These hairbows are ADORABLE and great quality!!! The flower is not too big but the perfect size. The colors are great! I highly recommend. Bought when my daughter was 1 month old and fit her then and still fits now at 4 mo old.</li>
    <li> These are great for the money.  They are very lightweight, but they fluff right up out of their tiny package and look super cute on.  They even fit my baby&#x27;s head - I&#x27;ve had trouble with most of the headbands I&#x27;ve ordered being too big.</li>
    <li> They are lovely, all i hear are compliments and are comofrtable for my baby, and the material will fit her for a long long time</li>
    <li> Love these they are exactly as shown great colors they arrived weeks ahead of schedule.These look and fit great on my 14 week old and look like they will grow with her</li>
    <li> Loved these! This pack is great and they looked adorable in my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> They are so cute and match all of my 3 month old daughter&#x27;s outfits very well.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 18 month old daughter and she loves them! Quality, cute and very reasonably priced. love the color selection they came with,</li>
    <li> I like these a lot.  They took longer than expected and I wish the felt on the bottom was a little softer, but, they&#x27;re so cute and I&#x27;m pleased to have a headband for pretty much every outfit my girl has.  My daughter is newborn size and they fit, but, I can see these lasting a lot longer.</li>
    <li> These come in darling colors that match the girls outfits.  The fit well and stay on their heads.  Love them.</li>
    <li> Such an awesome deal, sooo worth the money, they are beautiful! A great variety of colors too. We wear them all the time</li>
    <li> I bought these awhile ago and my daughter still fits them really well (she is now 15 months ) I love the variety of colors!!</li>
    <li> Adorable &amp; so happy with varying colors!</li>
    <li> These bows are great! My daughter loves them! So many colors to coordinate her outfits with. She is starting pre-K in the fall. Her new headbands are adding to the excitement. I&#x27;d give them 5 stars except the white circle that holds the flower on fell off two of the headbands. And she hasn&#x27;t even wore them out yet.</li>
    <li> One of my fav bow packages!</li>
    <li> I love the headbands. The colors match well with all my daughters outfits. Just wish that the bands could have been a little wider.</li>
    <li> My wee one wears these everywhere and gets so many compliments! They&#x27;re soft and fit perfectly. There are so many colors that I can just grab-and-go. Not expensive.</li>
    <li> Sooo adorable and a perfect purchase for baby girls everyday use. Fit my small 4 month old. Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> These are too cute and perfect I bought them for my 14 month old she did get upset and pull one off her head and the flower came off 😔 but with a hot glue gun it was fixed</li>
    <li> arrived 2 weeks before expected! I love &#x27;em!!  Got them for my great grand daughter who is 13 months old and they fit great and the flowers, even just coming out of the bag, were not smashed!  I love all the colors as well.</li>
    <li> Adorable!! Love them!!! Couldn&#x27;t Ask for better quality but they did take about a month to get to me well worth the wait</li>
    <li> I loved these headbands and the colors are so bright and colorful!! I have had so many people ask me where I have gotten them. Would recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Loves these...looks great on my baby girl!</li>
    <li> Really cute headbands. I would suggest washing them before use because they shed little bits of fabric from the eyelet cutouts. Otherwise, they are adorable and come in lots of fun colors for your baby girl.</li>
    <li> I am very happy that I choose this head band my god child looks so cute even when her hair is not combed. Value for your money and the price can&#x27;t be beaten</li>
    <li> These headbands are wonderful. i lovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvve them. She looks stunning in it. I would definitely recommend these headbands to anyone</li>
    <li> Love this set for my little girl .  Beautiful headbands go with everything. Great buy . Highly recommend these pieces</li>
    <li> Love, love these. It&#x27;s my second purchase from this seller. Will buy again. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Good quality! The flowers all held their shape without getting damaged during shipping. Soft bands and bright colors!</li>
    <li> These headbands are awful! The color of the bands doesn&#x27;t match the flowers. The flowers are made of EXTREMELY cheep see-through material that is fraying. NOT AT ALL AS PICTURED! Do not waste your money! I wish I could post a picture of what they REALLY look like.</li>
    <li> I love these bows! the white one will go great with my daughter&#x27;s Easter dress :) with these bows u can dress up or wear casual</li>
    <li> Beautiful array of colors but the flower is to big for infant heads</li>
    <li> pretty bows!  A bit too big for newborns but great all the same.</li>
    <li> Bright, vibrant colors.</li>
    <li> Little pieces of material will shed from the eyelets when you first use each headband.  Just hold it over the trash and give it a good little shake and brush.  It is the same feeling as emptying a hole punch.  Great array of colors.  Using them with my 8 month old often in hopes she will tolerate hair bands in future.</li>
    <li> They are super cute !! Arrived earlier than expected but was disappointed in some of the colors</li>
    <li> Baby doesn&#x27;t love them but they are the perfect size for a bald baby girl and there is one for any outfit she wears.</li>
    <li> Adorable, well made and a wonderful price. I received these very fast and they are so soft. Since the flowers are quite large I would recommend these for a baby six months and up.</li>
    <li> Must buy very good for the price mine came in less than 5 days :) !!!!!!! And look beautiful on my baby</li>
    <li> Love them!  Not too right and good quality</li>
    <li> The product was horrible, looks very cheap, quality is poor.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Best you&#x27;ll find for the money!</li>
    <li> They look great with any outfit &amp; they are the true colors!</li>
    <li> Fits very good for my girls, they wear it wit different colors of clothes. They are beautiful n I love the colors.</li>
    <li> Fit my 4 month old perfectly with room to grow. They are a little smaller in person than I expected which I like because I was afraid they would be too big. They are so cute and the colors are beautiful and most importantly they don&#x27;t seem to bother my daughter at all. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and they fit my baby girl (8 months) very well! They are not too tight, so I think that they will fit her for quite some time to come</li>
    <li> Order this for the kids I work with for dance festival &amp; they came within 2 days. They are very cute &amp; bright colorful headbands</li>
    <li> We love them...I should have ordered two sets....you can also use them as ponytail holders...Get your colorful headbands today... :)</li>
    <li> Cute colors! Only thing that bothered me was that they were packaged in a tiny bag making all of the bows flat and hard to retain their original shape. The white bow also had some spots of another color on it.</li>
    <li> Oh this Ones i Love it for My girls, the fabric is nice, soft , like the little pots on there , the form everything&amp;iexcl;!!! The colors by a good price!!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price will be ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> Love all the colors and product!</li>
    <li> So cute, and such a good value!</li>
    <li> Fits my baby&#x27;s head (3 months) and also my toddler whose 3 yrs old.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her headbands</li>
    <li> I love these headbands! They are so colorful. I get compliments on them everywhere I take my daughter!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous headbands... True to color and even prettier than picture. I love it.</li>
    <li> This review is only about shipping time and condition upon arrival as my baby girl isn&#x27;t here yet to give a review on size and how they fit. They do take a little longer to arrive than most things, however I had read the reviews and several ppl had warned about that so I was prepared. They come in a nicely made canvas, zippered bag, I did NOT think they were squished looking even though they had been in this bag, I even put them back in the bag and that&#x27;s prob where they will stay til used. They are very nicely made and do not at all hold up to the one review I read about bring poorly made and falling apart, I believe they will last quite a long time. Will definitely buy from this seller again. After my daughter gets here I will write a review on how they fit</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these adorable headbands. My daughter is 2 months old with a head circumference of 15in and it fits awesome. It doesn&#x27;t fit her very tight and it easily stretches so she can wear them for a good while. The colors are beautiful and attached very well to the headband with 2 round felt pieces. Not cheap looking like some reviews have stated. For the price, this is a great deal for a nice product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my niece and my sister in law loved it</li>
    <li> My daughter is 3 months and these fit her perfect!</li>
    <li> Cute flower headbands. Arrived as described and very quickly. Fit my daughter when she was a month old.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. This was a gift for a friend who  just had a little girl. She loves them.</li>
    <li> Super cute! Great value! My girls (an eight year old and a one year old) look adorable in these!</li>
    <li> Its very beautiful :)</li>
    <li> Bought these for my then 3 month old daughter. I love that they don&#x27;t fit tight around her head, she&#x27;s now almost six months and I believe she might be able to wear these well into her toddler years. I get many compliments for her when she wears them. They look really nice, not cheap at all. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought these bows for my friend who expecting in April. I ordered with Prime so they came In 2 days. They came stuffed in a plastic bag inside of a flat box, but once I removed them from the box/bag, the flowers regained their shape. They look exactly like the picture and didn&#x27;t smell of dye. My friend loved them. My only complaints are that some of the bands are longer than others meaning that they&#x27;ll probably need to be adjusted so that she can wear them. In addition, the white flower had a couple stains on it. But that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  I love these!</li>
    <li> My favorite set of headbands for my daughter so far. The elastic is a little on the smaller side ... i wish they came in additional sizes. Overall I really like them!</li>
    <li> Very cute! the only problem is that they run small. My babies could not wear them for more then an hour. I even purchase it a size bigger then the measuring chart.</li>
    <li> The flowers on these are very big, if you like that kind of hair bow.  I usually like flowers to be a bit smaller, so I will probably give these as a baby shower gift instead of keeping them for my baby girl.  It is nice to have a variety of colors as well as black and white.</li>
    <li> Super cute &amp; wonderfully priced! My only complaint is all of the tiny fabric circles that fall off of the flower (from having holes punched in them). A bit annoying, but I just shake them off and it&#x27;s no biggie.</li>
    <li> gracias todos muy bello a mi princesa le quedaron todos los recomiendo, rapidez en el envio...</li>
    <li> Bought these for my step Grand daughter who is almost 5 months old.  Fit is perfect! Love all the colors! Would definitely recommend.  So cute!!</li>
    <li> These colors are perfect for my baby&#x27;s cute outfits. There are 11 of them and its easy to match with outfits...love love love it! Baby get lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Too cute and mom loved them.</li>
    <li> I thought they were very cute and affordable as well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> they were a bit small</li>
    <li> Adorable considering for the amount paid. I&#x27;m definitely buying again but will have to do it sooner coz the shipping takes a lot of time.</li>
    <li> Great product. Just as pictured.</li>
    <li> Great headbands for my baby girl for a good price!</li>
    <li> The young couple who I bought these for were impressed that I, an old codger, would think of them as an appropriate gift!  They are having a girl and they were thrilled to have the bows for her.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. They came on time and are as beautiful as shown. They even came in a cute little reusable pink bag to keep them in and came with a card. I would highly recommend this item and ignore whatever bad reviews anyone has posted.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended! Good quality and very cute!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful.  These are my favorite go to bands for my baby.  She has been using them since she was a couple of weeks and I suspect they will fit at least until she is a year old.  They look so fantastic and the colors are great.  I would absolutely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> very pleased, received alot faster than stated on the site</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these headbands way way better than I expected  I very much recommend them they arrived 2 weeks before expected very happy with them and service.</li>
    <li> The headbands are adorable</li>
    <li> Love them they fit my 2 month old daughter and the colors are super cute and great quality for a cheap price !!! Totally recommend will be shopping from here more !!!</li>
    <li> These headbands fit my 1 month old, but the flowers are a lot bigger than they look in the picture.  They are about the size of a tennis ball.  No bad, just not what I was looking expecting.  I will still use them though.</li>
    <li> they are cute and soft and stretchy my daughter loves them</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this item. They are great material and are perfect for little girls. I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Really cute and easy. Only complaint is tht one broke when my daughter pulled it.</li>
    <li> I love that bows!  My twin baby girl looks adorable! I was surprised cause i received way earlier than ship said.  And seller is very nice!  Would def buy again!</li>
    <li> Good deal and would get more later.  The were all the right colors and style I liked. Thank you for all.</li>
    <li> Good bands and nicely sent.</li>
    <li> These bows are high quality, soft, and my 12 month old daughter actually enjoys wearing them. Shipping was fast and I will be ordering more of a different style. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Super cute! Good for babies and todlers!</li>
    <li> Love these! The colors are really pretty. I put one on my daughter when I want to get her all dolled up. The flower parts are really big which you don&#x27;t find with too many baby bows. The pricing for these made me even more happy. I love that the bows came in a reusable bag, so I can keep all of her bows together with no hassle</li>
    <li> I LOVE these headbands!! The wrap itself is smooth and not cotton so it won&#x27;t make hairloss around the edges of your babies head. One thing I will say is the flower is big lol so it wld be great on 6months on up unless your darling is having a photoshoot. My 6 year old can even wear them</li>
    <li> Great quality , Lovely colors .</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my 2 month old.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like at all. Two of them broke already. Soon the rest will.I really didn&#x27;t want to give this a star.</li>
    <li> They looks so cute on my granddaughter</li>
    <li> I liked these ok for my daughter. I felt the top bow part of them was on the bigger side, but, it&#x27;s all preference to me.</li>
    <li> I received these in the mail today and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. The flowers were perfect and they fit my six month old like a charm! All of the colors are exactly as pictured too! Only downside is the amount of time it took for them to get here but that is to be expected considering they were shipped from the other side of the globe. Oh and they came with a little pink bag to store them in which was an unexpected surprise! Would order from them again!</li>
    <li> Although they arrived a little crumpled, all but 2 of them fluffed up nicely once I took them out of the bag. The quality is great for the price!</li>
    <li> price is cheap but product is not. i LOVE these for my four month old!</li>
    <li> Love them I think they look better in person and they are soft which is great not too big not too little perfect</li>
    <li> These are good quality for the price.  My only complaint is they are fairly tight on my 6 month olds head and she has a fairly small head.  But for how tight they are she doesn&#x27;t act like they bother her.</li>
    <li> Very cute and delivery was faster than I expectet! Good qualitity and good size bows! It will look adorable on my newborn!</li>
    <li> Absolutely cute! Fits perfectly on my baby&#x27;s head and more sturdy than other headbands I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> Love them! Have received many compliments and inquiries as to where they were purchased.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Look exactly like the picture, shipping could have been faster but overall very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Great product, good quality</li>
    <li> These are the prettiest!!! My baby gets compliments on these all the time. Cant beat the price for all these!</li>
    <li> There are a few loose pieces from the cutouts on the flowers so I had to shake them a little but otherwise they&#x27;re awesome! I love the variety of colors and the quality... Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Great price,  good quality.  Hot pink wasn&#x27;t attached to headband like the rest were.  (No headband included so I just glued the flower to a barette)  very slow shipping</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these bows!!!!</li>
    <li> Omg sooo cute!!! Way worth the money and they are great quality!!! My babe loos so cute!</li>
    <li> Super cute headbands! Quality is decent.  The only problem is they did not come in the colors shown.  There was not a red or sea foam colored flower, but an off-white and dark purple instead.</li>
    <li> I got the package on estimated delivery date and I was MORE than pleased I bought them as a gift  for my 3 week old niece and they were absolutely stunning on her. GREAT quality all colors true to color.&lt;br /&gt;#5Stars</li>
    <li> Loved it especially the fact it came with a Lil bag to place them in</li>
    <li> these bows are adorable! the only problem I had is one of the bows were ripped if it wasnt for that id give them a five star shipping came extremely fast as well super cute at a super price</li>
    <li> These are PERFECT! They look great on my daughter.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the price! I snagged them for $4.00 + $1.00 shipping!</li>
    <li> Love them and great price!</li>
    <li> All arrived in great condition.  Better than I expected and I know they will look adorable on our little girl!</li>
    <li> I love. these. bows. I have bought them 4 different times for me my sisters and other baby gifts!!!! I HIGHLY recommend these they are super stretchy, fluffy, sweet , a good price, greta colors and just plain adorable on every baby girl out there</li>
    <li> Bow is a little big, which I expected. The headband part is bigger than what I thought so it&#x27;s constantly falling off baby. I&#x27;m sure as she gets bigger she will grow into them. Overall great buy for the amount we paid. Very cute!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with these bows! The colors are perfect for matching with every outfit. They seem like very high-quality and they fit nicely on my seven-month-old daughter. I would definitely recommend these to anyone!</li>
    <li> Couldnt be happier with this purchase and they look fabulous on my little one .. The price is great and i love how they come in every color..shipment takes a while but its worth the wait</li>
    <li> I ordered these for all of the bright colors and I got exactly what I wanted. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great quality, beautiful colors! The flowers are large, but look adorable!  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Had for months now...made get! Fits my daughter get (5yrs)</li>
    <li> My bows just came in (two weeks earlier than expected) and they are adorable. The price and what you get for it is great! I love how it has every color you could need! Super cute! Now I just have to wait for baby girl to arrive to use them! :)</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> I love these headbands. So many different colors I have yet to use them all. Great accessory</li>
    <li> really super cute head bands. Didn&#x27;t care for the white felt on the back of some dark color flowers.. other than that they were really nice.</li>
    <li> They are cute headbands, but a couple were not sewn correctly and one even arrived damaged. But for the price, I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> Works great with babies with lots of hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!! They arrived quick and are in great condition and look great on my baby girl. I recommend ordering these if you need headbands for little one.</li>
    <li> They r adorable and well made!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful bows! A little big for my newborns head but she&#x27;s growing into them. Took about 2 weeks to receive.</li>
    <li> My daughter wears on all of the time.  There are so many colors!</li>
    <li> These are so adorable! And for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. So many complements!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Love that these are soft and can be crammed anywhere but then pop back into the same shape. Great assortment of colors to go with literally any outfit you can find.</li>
    <li> The Headbands are really really nice durable and well made. I highly recommend these headbands to any one with a daughter. Many bright colors to match any outfit.</li>
    <li> Ain&#x27;t receive it yet cannot rate it but I love the colors on display</li>
    <li> They were a little bit bigger than I was expecting but they are still pretty and so many colors which is great.  I am obsessed with always having headbands on my baby girl so I am glad that this set came in so many colors because I always have a headband to match almost all my daughter&#x27;s outfits.  Also, I am pleased with the size of the headbands because they are not too tight.  Some other headbands I had purchased, I noticed they were too tight and would cause a dent in my baby&#x27;s head but that never happened with these bands so I am happy</li>
    <li> Love these ! I just received them ! &amp; I can&#x27;t wait for my little one to wear them ! Thank you thank you thank you thank you !!!</li>
    <li> These are the cutest!  I love them. . great color selection,  and they fit perfect :)</li>
    <li> Love these headbands, too. They fit my 8 month old perfectly. They came out of package fully fluffed &amp; so far have held up well!</li>
    <li> I can not say enough about these Q&#x27;s baby girl headbands. I have spent countless dollars on these. My daughter is now two. We have the best headband collection in town. They always smell chemically out of the package. I don&#x27;t get bothered by That does go away. We have had all of these hold up. I will continue to buy until I have every style. Just adorable. The shipping is much faster then it says it will be.</li>
    <li> Love love these hair bands !</li>
    <li> I bought these for our 1 month old baby since the title says they are meant for a baby. However, the headbands/flowers are huge - they look very silly on an infant baby&#x27;s head and are unusable. The pictures don&#x27;t represent what was shipped to me. The flowers on the website look small and tightly together - but in reality the flowers are huge and very floppy looking. Would not buy again &amp; very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and adorable when worn! (Bow is a little big for a newborn.)</li>
    <li> Very cute, great quality.  Colors are great and they fit my 12 month old daughter very well.</li>
    <li> Looks very cute not too big and the colors looks just like the picture. I bought two sets for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I loved these bows. 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> These are so cute and here the flower is there is a soft felt padding so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my kid&#x27;s head. One of the flowers doesn&#x27;t lay flat and you can see the padding though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the product. Bow isn&#x27;t huge, just the right size, colors are perfect. Shipping took forever though, which was a huge downer. I felt like I waited forever -3 weeks-. Other than that, I LOVE the headbands.</li>
    <li> Very cute. I love it . My daughter is 3 years old and they fit her head perfectly. I just wish there were more colors.</li>
    <li> Great headbands. My daughter looks beautiful when wearing them. Colors look great and headbands are well made. Order came in quickly. Loved the price!!!</li>
    <li> Just received my order today and I must say I&#x27;m super happy! I absolutely love them!! I can&#x27;t wait for my gorls to wear all of them! Will definitely be ordering more of their other styles!!</li>
    <li> Very cute for the price! Can&#x27;t wait to see them on baby!</li>
    <li> I absolutely fell in love with these as soon as they arrived I tried one on my daughter and it fit perfectly. They are soft and well fitted.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product! It was delivered in a decent amount of time. The colors were perfect and the flower was nice and fluffy. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I, love these headbands! Super cute :-) well worth it and a great price!!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful headbands! Great value for the money. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> They ae awesome headbands!!!!</li>
    <li> These headbands are my favorite for my baby. They are soft and don&#x27;t dent her head. Best bright colors too!</li>
    <li> I saw some not so great reviews on these headbands and i decided to order anyway.....&amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did!!!!! They are so cute the colors are just right my 5 year old loves them!!!! great great product</li>
    <li> I got these for my 6 year old and she loves them. There are so many colors and they arent tight on her head. One of the headbands came with a flowers unattached but it can be fixed with glue or something. Other than that, they are great and buying them here is better than buying a single headband for $5 in a store somewhere.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the person who gave this product one star was talking about. They are exactly as pictured above. They came stuffed into a tiny bag, but after some fluffing, they all looked great! These are excellent for the price and I&#x27;ll be uploading pictures soon for everyone who&#x27;s curious.</li>
    <li> I love these! My daughter always gets compliments when she wears them and so may colors to choose from...they match all her outfits! :)</li>
    <li> These bows are super cute and fit my 3 month old perfect and dont squeeze her head. They came in 10 days too so that was nice.</li>
    <li> Love the headbands!! My niece just turned one and they fit her great!!</li>
    <li> Very nice. Fast shipping and much larger than they look in the puvture</li>
    <li> Love all the different colors! I have a lot of people comment on them and ask me where I got them.</li>
    <li> I was really nervous about ordering these after some of the reviews I read and had been researching bows to order for my 7 week old and finally decided on these. I am very pleased w these  bands but they aren&#x27;t too thin and don&#x27;t dig into her scalp and fit her well, which I was nervous about.( Her head is normal to small for her age.) they also kept well in the packaging and the flower is a good size and nice and fluffy and doesn&#x27;t lose shape. Colors are true to picture. They are good for everyday or for parties. Great price for the amount you get also. I went to target and couldn&#x27;t find anything that fit her, they only had headbands or clips which were $5-$7 for one! These are also stretchy enough to where I have a feeling I can use them for at least a few years.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my youngest (3 mo old) and they are perfect! Quality is good and they fit perfectly without falling down or looking like they are strangling their head! There are so many colors that they go with just about anything! Love the bright colors, changes it up! I even put them on my 4 yo!</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my 4 month old and I love them! Came quicker than expected and are great quality! I&#x27;ve seen similar hair bows in boutiques sell for much more and was glad to have a wide assortment of colors in one grouping. My these fit my baby girls head but aren&#x27;t too snug to where they cut into her like some do. They stretch a good bit so I know she can wear them for a long time. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with these!</li>
    <li> Great color assortment, high quality, and not too tight. They are much better than the overpriced store bought head bands</li>
    <li> Omg I love them elastic so perfect feets till 0/12 months so cute nice colors lovet😍</li>
    <li> I love all the beautiful colors</li>
    <li> Really like the design.</li>
    <li> Loved the variety of colors product was received as described and perfect fit for infant</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and handband. Not too tight or loss on my baby&#x27;s hand. Its fit perfect</li>
    <li> These are overall great for the price. Some of the bands dont match the flowers exactly but still very cute. The width of the elastic is wide enough that so not to dig into my daughters head.</li>
    <li> Always getting compliments. Withstands my baby tugging at the flower all the time.</li>
    <li> I love them. My daughter is only 3 months and it fits on her perfectly. I don&#x27;t know why some of the people on here complaining that it looks cheap. Look how much u paid for it duh. Ya&#x27;ll acting like ya&#x27;ll paid $1000 for it. You get what u paid for and I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price. Tons of colors. Very pretty. You must like a BIG bow, as these are quite large. Thankfully, I do.</li>
    <li> There beautiful it looks better in person and fit well.</li>
    <li> I love these headbands for my babygirl there affordable and have beautiful colors</li>
    <li> EXTREMELY cute headbands for a great price. Cannot wait to see them on my daughter. I was nervous the flowers would be too big or look cheap but they are adorable. Really glad I got them for her as they will match any outfit and will not look oversized on her.</li>
    <li> These were a great purchase. They are soft and stretchy and fit perfectly on my newborn daughters head without being too loose. She is now several months old and they still fit great without leaving mark&#x27;s on her head. The great color selection allows me to match her headbands with her outfits.</li>
    <li> I loved these flowers. my daguhter has one to match every outfit.</li>
    <li> They fit my 3 month old perfectly, with room to spare! Great buy for the price. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Although very  pretty, the actual headband part is pretty small and tight on my baby&#x27;s head and she has a small head. I have to stretch them out a bit.</li>
    <li> These are really nice headbands but not for everyday wear. My little one pulled try flower off one of them sadly</li>
    <li> I would def buy this again!</li>
    <li> So cute,  stretchy and soft. My daughter is 3 months old and they fit her perfect. I even tried to put one of them on my head to see if it will fit me comfortably and it does! Great deal!</li>
    <li> Very pretty...even better than you think from the picture!! The colors are exact ~ so pretty!!  AGAIN, DO NOT be upset when they arrive all smooshed &amp; flat!!  Take them out &amp; &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; them a time or two ~ my daughter just gave a good shake &amp; they looked GREAT!!  A great price for this many headbands!!  Very pretty &amp; my daughter LOVES THEM!!</li>
    <li> These are soo cute!!!  I was a lil skeptical but I was wrong, they look great!!!  Can&#x27;t beat the price! !!</li>
    <li> Took a lil to get em but great quality &amp; color! I was a lil scared to order cuz of the past reviews but im glad i bought em!</li>
    <li> These headbands were exactly what I expected! They are so cute and look exactly like they do in the picture. I&#x27;ve already ordered more.</li>
    <li> These are fabulous bows that fit probably the best I&#x27;ve ever bought. They are perfect size and colorful. Will buy from again.</li>
    <li> These headbands are cute but not really that useful, I found that the bows were a lot bigger than expected. The colors are nice and for the price they are very well made. They wear comfortably and did not irritate my daughter or her hair too much.  In my opinion, these are more for special occasions where you need a &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; factor but not really for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> Good Quality, vibrant colors.</li>
    <li> These are adorable and worth the money I spent.</li>
    <li> Headbands were cute and good quality for the price.  A snug fit (but not too snug) on my newborn&#x27;s head.  As expected, they took a few weeks to ship, but overall, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Adorable.  A little big for a newborn, probably perfect for an 6+ month.</li>
    <li> While there are many cute baby headbands on the market I do not like how big many of the flowers are, very impractical for wearing for more than a few minutes. These flowers are the perfect size!!! Just a little over an inch. The headbands are soft and stretchy. This is a great deal for so many colors. FYI, the band may be slightly large for a newborn but they fit my 6 month old great</li>
    <li> i bought these for my 6month old daughter and u love them!! always get complements on them! deff buy some more!!</li>
    <li> Super Cute!!! Cant beat the price!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, not a fan of how long it takes to ship. But what can you do when it comes from China.</li>
    <li> It was a big surprise. Is a cheap item and They are amazing, Gorgeous a good fabric, thanks</li>
    <li> Adorable and value for money headbands for my little one. It looked better than expected when I had her wear them. My little bub received a lot of compliments for her headband. Love the fact that it&#x27;s also value for money.</li>
    <li> They are absolutely cute. My 3 week old looks so adorable in them! Grate price and value . I will definitely buy  some for my nices .</li>
    <li> Very cute for my 1 year old.</li>
    <li> I love these and always receive complements. Quality better than expected. My daughter&#x27;s 7 months and has been wearing the same ones since birth.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what was advertised--11 headbands in the colors shown. Bows are all in good condition and very cute. I would order again!</li>
    <li> Ordered for newborn, item was quality handmade, washed once no dies washing out. Totally different then ordering other similar like items from overseas manufacturing and would either fall apart or dies fade immediately.</li>
    <li> Prefect gift for my baby girl</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pay attention to how big the bows actually are, but I still LOVE them! Due to size, may not be good for a newborn, but definitely 3 months and up. You can&#x27;t beat the price, either: An amazing deal. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> These are great.  Love all the colors.  Hold up well and fit any size head.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and it was a great gift.</li>
    <li> My daughter always gets compliments on these cute headbands.  She is about 1 and these fit her great.</li>
    <li> Love these bows for my 5 month old and so many colors really match anything and everything</li>
