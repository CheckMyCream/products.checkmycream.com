<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great shampoo - i love the fekkai haircare product line - havent used anything that i dont like.  My hair is wavy and thick and this and the color care line work great on my hair type.</li>
    <li> I order this all the time one of my favorite shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners</li>
    <li> This stuff give my hair the moisture and shine it craves.</li>
    <li> really thick and heavy but rinses out ok.  nice scent</li>
    <li> This is a favorite hair product and was a reorder.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great for shine.  I have thick, baby fine hair, and the lather is rich, it does get rid of hairspray residue,but takes a bit of scrubbing.  To be fair, I generally only wash every three days or so, so the hairspray build up can be stiff.  The conditioner does detangle, but doesn&#x27;t do deep conditioning, even if you leave it in.  Supplement with weekly deep conditioner for ultra soft hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and super shiny! Love it!</li>
    <li> Fekkai shampoos are simply the best! For years I have spent countless dollars on shampoos that talk the talk but deliver slab results. This is not the case with this brand. I get compliments all the time at the salon at how soft and healthy my hair is. They don&#x27;t even try and sell me there product because this is so much better. I can go a couple of days without washing my hair and it is not greasy at all! I have medium/thick hair and I don&#x27;t need to use a ton of shampoo to get a good lather. Your best prices on this product will be here on Amazon or at Ulta because you can use their coupons to save some money. Check the clearance section at Walgreens. I have gotten lucky a couple of times and found them discounted to 9.99 a bottle!</li>
    <li> Fekkai is a good product line; however, I first purchased their advanced glossing formula and loved it - definitely a 5-star.  When I went to reorder, the site was not offering advanced glossing, but their regular formula.  I like the advanced formula much better.</li>
    <li> Only shampoo for fine color hair</li>
    <li> delivery and product was excellent</li>
    <li> Good for my hair.  So soft and silky.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I purchased this for my niece at Christmas time .She just loves this product.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - have fine hair - makes it feel nice</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it.  I used this in combination with the same conditioner and styling cream.  However, the glossing effect was too much -- my hair looked more greasy than shiny.  I tried it with a different styling cream and still didn&#x27;t like the effect it had on my hair.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for dry hair or gray hair, leaves a lovely gloss without the hair feeling oily or sticky.</li>
    <li> I buy this with the Brilliant glossing conditioner. When I used both of them together I didn&#x27;t see any significant shine like it is supposed to be. I tried Aveda shine shampoo and conditioner before. It did make my hair shiny. But it&#x27;s quite pricey to buy big bottle.&lt;br /&gt;However I do love the smell of Fekkai. And I believe they are good hair product company. Maybe this shampoo wasn&#x27;t for me. But the conditioner was good.</li>
    <li> As a product with silicone in it, this shampoo does not smooth the hair enough. Don&#x27;t know what happened.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair has never felt healthier.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It is adequate but nothing special.</li>
    <li> smells nice, keeps my fine, frizzy hair as manageable as any other product i&#x27;ve ever used. i think it&#x27;s a bit pricey, and i usually choose all natural products, but i&#x27;ll make an exception to keep this in my supply of hair care products.</li>
    <li> Like many of you probably have, I have tried so, so many shampoos and conditioners. This Fekkai glossing line just always comes through. I use the glossing shampoo, conditioner, and styling product. My hair loves it all.</li>
    <li> I heard that Fekkai brought back shine and took away build up.  But this did not. My hair was as dry and lifeless as usual. I have naturally dry hair so a friend suggested I try Fekkai Cream Shampoo, so I &#x27;m going to give this type a chance . And if it doesn&#x27;t work, go back to Pantene which is better for me.</li>
    <li> Love all of Fekkai&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo and it cleans without drying out my normal hair. Since a little goes a long way, it is quite concentrate, but if you use sparingly it is a good value.</li>
    <li> I really like this Fekkai Glossing shampoo. A little goes a long way. It foams very well ans smells great. Just after 2 uses my hair has a healthy shine and my damaged ends do not frizz. I have oily scalp, but this shampoo does not weigh my hair down. I will definitely buy more Fekkai products! Very happy with my purchase. I got a 15% discount for including this item in my Subscribe&amp;Save shipment. Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that I like from the fekkai line. I&#x27;ve tried his other shampoos and was not very impressed. This one leaves my hair very soft and shinny. I have medium somewhat wavy hair. My hair is not thin nor is it thick, it&#x27;s in between. People have raved abt how wonderful it smells, personally I&#x27;ve smelled better shampoos. It has an earthy, grassy smell. It&#x27;s not my favorite but I do not hate it. Overall a great shampoo!</li>
    <li> Loved this shampoo and conditioner. I have long thin hair. I am going to buy it again. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner  I have ever used. My hair and scalp feels good and no more flaking. I highly recommend this product. I will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> Only shampoo I&#x27;ll use,love the shine it gives,my hair feels so healthy.Love the light fragrance,too!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. My hair is shiny and smells incredible for days. Soft but not oily.</li>
    <li> I had a sample size of this shampoo so I only tried it once. It&#x27;s hard for me to really get a feel of a shampoo in just one wash, but I loved the smell and feel of it. It was very light and lathered well. It also doesn&#x27;t contain some of the harsh chemicals in other shampoos which are bad for hair color, so I loved that about it. I&#x27;d love to get a bottle to try it out for a month or so to see how well my hair does with it on a consistent basis</li>
    <li> It cleans very well and smells nice.  My hair is shiny.  If it didn&#x27;t cost so much, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> truly the only shampoo I will use, and this price is amazing, pay $20+ in the retail stores.  My hair is so shiny every time, no buildup and I&#x27;ve been using it for MONTHS.  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner! After using it exclusively for a couple of weeks, I have pretty much turned on my old hair products that I *thought* I loved. The Fekkai products make my thick, wavy hair much more manageable, smooth and silky. One day I thought I would try my old stuff just to see the difference and it was amazing-- amazingly bad, that is. My hair felt kind of tangly and dry and just didn&#x27;t look as good. I didn&#x27;t even realize before that my hair could look and feel so much better! I am sold.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite shampoos for the morning, it really wakes you and your hair up, it&#x27;s bright and green with a high shine gloss and it suds up wonderfully, it really wakes me up in the morning. I love this when I want extra freshness and will pair it with the Shea conditioner which guarantees smoothness. You can feel the nourishing ingredients care for your hair as you wash it in, the olive is hidden but working, I love this stuff, so green and vibrant you wish you could sink your teeth in it, but please don&#x27;t lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a glossing formula and I actually do notice a lot of shine from this, a gloss finish that is very vibrant and silky. My hair feels very clean, went and fresh and when I run out of the house in the morning and it feels bouncy and invigorated. Best basic daily shampoo that I can think of that&#x27;s anything but \\&quot;basic\\&quot;... it&#x27;s the elevated daily wash. It&#x27;s simple but does a lot for your tresses.</li>
    <li> Fekkai glosing products are great</li>
    <li> I have baby-fine hair and live near the ocean... this does a great job keeping the frizzies and fly-aways at bay and protects it from the sun and salt water!</li>
    <li> Love this nice hair care product. It was very rich, so no conditioner was necessary. Didn&#x27;t think the bottle was that big, but considering the amount needed to create a good lather, it lasts quite a long time as long as you don&#x27;t overuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, it has a great scent. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Leaves my hair soft and touchable.</li>
    <li> First off let me state that I am removing 1 star because this product was damaged during shipping and half it was leaked out.  This is not the fault of the product but it is the fault of Amazon who is providing the product and shipping method in this case.&lt;br /&gt;Disregarding the shipping snafu, this product cleans your hair very well and leaves your hair feeling fuller or thicker.  I really speak to the glossy part, as the reflectivity of my hair appears about the same to my eye.  But I do think it does a good job as shampoos go.</li>
    <li> First couple of times I used, I see no difference from other Shampoo I use (Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Nourishing Shampoo), but my hair started to feel heavier as I continue using it. I used it with Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Conditioner, and maybe because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: You need only a tiny amount to wash your hair. If your hair tends to become big and difficult to tame, this shampoo will weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: It weighs hair down. If you want volume, this shampoo is not for you. I also don&#x27;t like the scent. It&#x27;s too strong. I like their Apple Cider scent better. It doesn&#x27;t really make my hair glossier.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It actually left my hair much glossier and shinier after use. My hair is down to the middle of my back, so the ends are 2-3 years old and tend to be really unhealthy. I use heating tools occasionally but not too often, but with my curly and frizzy hair, the damage is very noticable. This shampoo by itself (without a Fekkai conditioner) has restored my hair&#x27;s shine after just 1 use! I definitely will be buying other Fekkai products.</li>
    <li> I really loved how this smelled and made my scalp feel. It gave a really nice cooling sensation, a nice lather and made my hair feel great.&lt;br /&gt;It is on the pricey side, but is very worth it if you are willing to spend on shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a pleasant, fresh scent.  It&#x27;s a very thick shampoo and I find I have to use a lot because it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as some competing products.  Unfortunately, that means I run through this a lot more quickly than I&#x27;d like.  (I usually just shampoo the roots of my hair and not the length, as a way to preserve color.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does contain sulfates; however, I&#x27;ve been using it on my color-treated roots and I don&#x27;t notice any fading.  I do feel that it gets y hair clean, even after exercise and sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be wondering, at this point, why I gave this four stars in spite of all the negatives mentioned above.  And the reason I did this is because this stuff works.  My hair looks wonderful after using this -- it&#x27;s moisturized and less frizzy and shiny.  So the effects are amazing and I&#x27;m willing to put up with the qualities I don&#x27;t like as much if it&#x27;ll give me nice-looking hair.</li>
    <li> Works great on dry frizzy curly hair. This company is better than the stores and cheaper.</li>
    <li> The smell is fantastic and not overwhelming. I found that I do not have to use much (about a dime size) to get a decent lather for my hair (I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s thin and below shoulder length). For someone with thick or curly hair should be able to use a quarter-size amount to work well. The price is a bit higher than I anticipated but overall the quality of product is great.</li>
    <li> my daily shampoo! I think it is useful for my fuzzy hair, although it is really pricy so make is a 4 star</li>
    <li> I was sent a free sample of this shampoo by influenster to try and give an honest review.  Unfortunately the sample was only good for 2 uses, therefore hard to tell you about long time use.  My hair is thick and curly.  It did lather up nicely and has a light scent.  I am highly sensitive to smells and avoid buying any products with smell that will last all day so was worried about that once I opened the shampoo.  Luckily it was a nice light scent during my shower but gone after styling my hair.  I also used this with the conditioner and I was happily surprised how soft my hair felt.  I normally use Suave or Pantene as they work just as well as the more expensive lines.  Since this line is mid-priced I will buy a small bottle to use for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> My hair felt dry and unhealthy. After using this product, I saw a difference right away. My hair had a nice shine to it and was looking smooth and healthy. If you try this product you might want to try the conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> Wnderful, does not leave hair greasy but yet shiny.  Smells great and scent stays in hair all day.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has an intoxicating floral smell, and it left my hair clean and shiny.  Much like its matching conditioner, I found this shampoo to be thin, much thinner than other formulas I&#x27;m accustomed to.  It lathered well enough, though, and as mentioned, the smell is fresh and a bit floral, and is most delightful.  I&#x27;d wear a perfume that smells like this shampoo.  All of that said, this shampoo is expensive, and I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the money.  On experience alone, with a product I received free to test, it&#x27;s easy for me to give five stars.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be willing to shell out for it, though, as it was not a miracle product by any means.</li>
    <li> If you have oily hair it is okay.  However, if your hair is normal or dry it will REALLY BE DRY AFTER USING THIS!!  Look at the price, HIGHLY EXPENSIVE AND DOES NOT WORK ON NORMAL OR DRY HAIR!!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is AMAZING!  I received a free sample from Influenster for testing purposes and immediately bought the product!  It left my hair so smooth and shiny and my style lasted all day!  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I have super dry, dull hair and am always on the lookout for a great shampoo. This shampoo totally does the trick! My hair feels so much more moisturized and I love how soft, and manageable it is after using too. My hair has more bounce, looks so much shinier and healthier and look and feels completely amazing! I&#x27;m absolutely head over heels for this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample for free from Influenster and Fekkai for the purpose of review. #voxbox</li>
    <li> This product was watered down! Either not the real deal or product has been altered.</li>
    <li> Very gentle Shampoo. Nice lather and very easy rinse, no residue. No need to wash twice. Fragrance is subtle and leaves hair smelling bright and lovely.&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY curly hair and this product produces a smooth, sleek, and shiny gloss. No frizzies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34; *</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this shampoo.  I love the conditioner too!</li>
    <li> This was the only one of the Fekkai shampoo&#x27;s that I hadn&#x27;t used and did so yesterday and today and absolutely love it.  Makes my hair nice and clean and the fragrance is wonderful.  Very light fragrance in a shampoo that makes your hair shine.  I love switching around the shampoo&#x27;s and conditioner&#x27;s in this line and my hair feels so much the better for it.  Hubby just looks at the shower shelf and shakes his head but he too likes the shampoo as I caught him sneaking some.</li>
    <li> I read about this brand shampoo in a magazine article which gave it a very favorable review. So, I purchased it and have to say it is an excellent product.  I have brown, very fine and thinning hair that has a mind of its own and usually needs to be washed every day.  With this Fekkai shampoo however, I only need to wash my hair every other day, sometimes every two days.  My hair is soft and manageable, easier to style and not as dull as it was.  I just reordered this.  I also tried the Apple Cider Shampoo of the same brand which I use once a week.  It helps to remove any hair product that I may use and still leaves my hair just as good as the regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo.  Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite shampoo.  It keeps your hair shiny and helps stop your scalp from drying out.  I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner for years.</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo.  You don&#x27;t have to use much.  I alternate this with the Fekkai PRX shampoo.  My hair is shiny and looks great.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo and will continue to buy. PERFECT for fine hair. My hair looks healthier and is fuller. Product as described. Fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> A nice addition to the products I use.</li>
    <li> Very, very happy with this line of hair care. The price is right. The shipping is fast.</li>
    <li> Love love love this shampoo. Leaves my hair glossy and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I received this product from the company in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to get this project since my think, brown hair is dull and I really want it to be shiny and smooth. I used the sample, and it didn&#x27;t do either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell great and my hair feels really clean, much cleaner than my current shampoo, but I as hoping it would make my hair smoother and more shiny.</li>
    <li> I adore this shampoo.  The shine my hair has after using this shampoo is incredible.  You only need a tiny speck to work up a perfect amount of lather. It is worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Love the clean, fresh smell of this product and the way it left my hair feeling so soft and manageable!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo!  My hair is frizzy, very curly, and hard to manage, and after one wash in this shampoo, it was the shiniest and least frizzy that I have ever seen it!  I was really impressed, and happy to FINALLY find a product that really works!  Thank you Fekkai!</li>
    <li> Good,    I gave my review on the brilliant glossing styling creme sleeks and shines and I did not see it come up.  I just wish the it was a bit bigger in size.</li>
    <li> Amazing Shampoo!  Affordable and actually works!  I had enough for one use from an Influenster sample box and even then I saw a difference - definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Shampoo works amazing, especially when you follow it up with the conditioner. This Fekkai product leaves my hair shinny and smells amazing! Definitely throwing out my old routine and replacing it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner. It did not change anything for my hair, but maybe it works for some people. Suave seemed to make my hair softer than this, and it was REALLY expensive. It didn&#x27;t hurt my hair, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help, either.</li>
    <li> I received a trial of this through Influenster. I have really long, thick, curly hair - so unfortunately I was only able to get one wash out of the trial - but my hair is very smooth/soft after using both the shampoo and conditioner. Would love to see how daily use improved my hair!</li>
    <li> Smells great!  I prefer Wen over this but its still a good product.</li>
    <li> This really helped my lack luster hair and brittleness. Loved it</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. While it is pricey it gives my thin hair a lot of body.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and I highly recommend.  It does exactly as it states it will.  My hair feels very nourished after using.  It is on the pricy side, but if your interested in pampering your hair you&#x27;ll also think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll start by saying that my hair is fine, thin, dry, colored &amp; tends to frizz. This shampoo was thick &amp; creamy - had a rich feel to it. While my hair is below my shoulders (long), because it is so thin, I was able to use the sample twice which is how I generally wash my hair. I loved the smell of it, but it didn&#x27;t lather as much as I would have liked it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing, my hair felt soft &amp; clean, but nothing spectacularly different than the other shampoo that I use. I was most interested in the moisturizing &amp; shining effect of this. It did moisturize my hair, but did not offer it any additional shine. I was only able to use this once, so I don&#x27;t know what effect it would have on my hair after continuous use.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I have long thick curly hair and I received a sample to try and LOVED it!!!!  My hair is amazingly shiny and full of life now that I have used this product.  Once I was out of the sample my hair went dull, but as soon as I get my new bottle I will see a major difference.  I can not wait.  I loved all the compliments I received when I used Fekkai!!!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have ever used.  I have fine hair and it maintains such a sheen and keeps the electricity out of my hair.  Can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
    <li> The girls have been using this shampoo and the matched conditioner and their hair is as shiny as ever.  This shampoo does wash out nicely with our low flow shower head.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I noticed a difference in my hair immediately and love the smell the product leaves in my hair.  My hair is shiny and this product does not leave an oily residue in my hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Smells great!  I got samples via an Influenster Voxbox, and I was extremely excited to try these products.  My first impression was great, because it smells amazing.  The Shampoo lathers up very nicely and leaves hair soft and clean.  I liked that it was a thicker shampoo and not super thin like most are.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo with the accompanying conditioner several times over the last year or so. Although I do like it and do not mind using it again, it didn’t enrich my hair any better than a drugstore shampoo (e.g. Garnier Fructis). Mind you, some drugstore shampoos are improving their quality gradually. But if I’m going to pay much more for Fekkai and get the same results, then why do it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it’s relevant to know, I have thick and wavy hair by the way.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this product. I feel like it lathers well. It gives me a clean feeling which is always a good thing. Works well would buy again</li>
    <li> I love it. Very nice to the hair, leaves them silky and soft.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! Gives my hair such shine!!</li>
    <li> Besides smelling wonderful this product has always been one of my favorite shampoos because my hair is so much more luxuriously feeling after I shampoo it even help with my comb out  even if I decide not to use a conditioner and just a mere doll up will do, I say just purchase it you won&#x27;t be sorry,and enjoy your senses!</li>
    <li> So thick it&#x27;s like lotion coming out of the bottle, and you don&#x27;t need to use much at a time, so it lasts a while. I shampoo my hair usually twice a week or so, and I can stretch out the benefits of this luxurious product by using a standard shampoo for the first, &amp;#34;grease-cutter&amp;#34; lather, then I switch to the Fekkai for the second, &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; lather.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is healthy and wavy and takes to almost any shampoo well, but this one has a &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; feeling during the shampooing process. Both the nice scent and the thickness of the shampoo make using it an experience that&#x27;s worth that little extra.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is actually quite thick -- more like a conditioner. Even when my hair is thoroughly wet I must splash more water on it into the shampoo just to work up a lather. I have had some organic shampoos that are this way, and I must say that I experience similar results with this product as I do with many of those....it makes my hair a bit bushy and frizzy which doesn&#x27;t allow me to experience any gloss that should exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the review of the conditioner in this line, I said that it reminds me more of a clarifying product and the same holds true here.</li>
    <li> Fekkai, product have become more difficult to find in the stores, and it&#x27;s wonderful to find this listed on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve tried many products and this by far holds to the standard of leaving hair silky without effort.  Continues to be my choice.</li>
    <li> I have tried literally everything.  I Have a cosmetologogy license so I have access to all of the salon brands and for the first time in over 10 years I finally found a shampoo and conditioner that is a miracle worker.  Absolutely worth the money</li>
    <li> I love the Fekkai line.  My hair is noticeably shinier and more manageable than when I use other products.  I now travel with it.  I rarely write reviews, but I love this shampoo/conditioner so much, that I wanted to pass along the feedback.  For reference, my hair is medium thickness and straight.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the foaming. Tried Wen, but went back to this one!</li>
    <li> I liked the way this shampoo made my hair feel, but I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent, though it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming, and I think I was slightly allergic to it. My hair looked great though - thicker and glossier than usual, and in good condition. It&#x27;s a great brand, but I think I can get comparable results with less expensive shampoos and I wouldn&#x27;t try this again because of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and the conditioner is great!  Best shampoo I ever purchased and I spend a lot on good shampoo.  I usually purchase at Beauty Supply Stores but they were out temporarily due to package remodel so I was desperate to get some.  Surprised it was on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I received this product compliments of @influenster and love it. It has made my hair shiny and more alive looking.  My hair is moisturized and glossy and feels soft and bouncy.  I will continue to use this product as I love the results.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo i wish they have styling moose !!</li>
    <li> It really does make your shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic (as do all their products) and works on my terribly damaged bleach blond easily tangled fine hair. It *almost* adds enough glossing and slippery conditioning with the shampooing stage that I don&#x27;t even need to use the conditioner (well, I still do, but I need a lot less).</li>
    <li> Love this product. Does as advertised</li>
    <li> This is my daughters favorite shampoo for her perfect long hair. I bought this for her Christmas stocking.shell love my buying it.</li>
    <li> fekkai brilliant glossing shampoo- this shampoo has a very nice texture and scent.  I normally use a moisturizing low sulfate shampoo but had a chance to try this glossing shampoo.  It seems to be less smoothing than my moisturizing low sulfate shampoo.  If however you have not found a suitable shampoo to do the job for you I would suggest giving this a try, especially if your hair is dry.</li>
    <li> Lathers like no other!  Great scent!</li>
    <li> I used this years ago and always loved it. I thought I would start saving money and buy good but cheaper drug store brands telling myself they are just as good as expensive products. The other day I pulled out my 3/4 empty bottles of years old Fekkai and used them. After one wash my hair looked and felt so much better! My hair has more life, bounce and shine to it. I am going back to this product again. There really IS a difference! It is about $5 cheaper here than at the store.</li>
    <li> good for the price, keeps my color, not too slippery, right balance of moisture.</li>
    <li> i really like this shampoo, smells great and yes, it gives your hair a great gloss! I&#x27;m a big fan of all Fekkai products, they all seem to do what they advertise and this glossing shampoo is no exception! After using this for a few days, I had people asking me what products I was using to make my hair so shiny and they were all amazed when I said that I just used Fekkai glossing shampoo!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It smells absolutely divine and make your hair glossy and shiny. However, it does strip color out, so I have had to stop using it. If you do not color treat your hair, you will have no issue and probably adore this. But it&#x27;s not for those of us who color. While Fekkai does make a shampoo for color-treated, the smell is not the same and I don&#x27;t care for it. Nonetheless, this is a wonderful shampoo as long as you don&#x27;t color treat!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, it leaves my hair feeling so soft and shines beautifully</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair that gets super frizzy at the slightest hint of humidity so I&#x27;m always looking for hair care products that can tame my hair and not require super diligent blow-drying. The Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Shampoo worked really well on my hair. Made my hair nice and shiny and breezy and didn&#x27;t weight it down at all. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about really was the smell (it&#x27;s really no different than any other high-end shampoo), but that&#x27;s a personal preference. I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumey scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as good as any of the top brands. Basically it&#x27;s a personal choice. I like it.</li>
