<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The picture is deceiving.&lt;br /&gt;If you have long hair, save your money.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 5 packets because of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are so short and poor quality!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they are easy to install but fall apart quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Opened mine when they came in the mail and three strands were off!&lt;br /&gt;They are cheaply made and put together.</li>
    <li> When the hair feather trend first started becoming popular I stayed away from it because it was so expensive where I live t o get them put in. I finally went to my local salon and had some put in...I cost me $60.00! So I got online and really started looking for good quality feathers that I could buy and put i myself at home. I found these and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! :D Wonderful quality and they can in the mail so fast! I WILL be buying more because my three sisters now want feathers and I like to change mine every few weeks instead of every few months. If you&#x27;re looking for good feathers that LAST good job you found them!</li>
    <li> I really love this set! It came with a good mix of thin strands and fluffy feathers. They are glued together as one unit, but it is very easy to pull apart and use individual strands if you like. Came super quick! I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Good quality feathers.</li>
    <li> Got these in about 3 days and I love them!! I had seen people in other reviews complaining about receiving less than 5 feathers. I got the opposite of that as I got 6(awww yisss). 2 grizzly(zebra), two black, and two white. And I wasn&#x27;t expecting to get heads so I ordered a set of 100, but turns out these came with 2. I am extremely pleased and think they look great in my hair :) once I get this pixie cut grown out past my shoulders, I will definitely be buying another set!</li>
    <li> These feathers are beautiful and sturdy. I added them into my hair. I have small dreads and these are a great addition! I love them and I would suggest them to anyone. You may need some help with the installation tho..  They come with small beads with rubber pieces inside. I used a pair of piercing forceps to flatten the bead into my hair.</li>
    <li> I really wanted feathers for a long time. I was a little hesitant about ordering offline. Within 24 hours of ordering, my feathers were shipped and even arrived before they were supposed to! When I opened the package the feathers looked almost identical to the picture (quality wise) and even came with two micro links. I would never buy feathers from another seller. Sexy sparkles gives you exactly what you pay for, for an amazing price. I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with my order :)</li>
    <li> I just received my feathers today, and they are very cute. One was brown striped, two were white, and two were skinny and black. They all go very well together. I&#x27;m thinking I could either pull them apart and wear one or two, or just leave them all together. Such a fabulous deal, especially when feathers normally cost 10 dollars each in the stores/salon, and I spent less than $4 for 5 feathers plus the cost of shipping. Well...I&#x27;m off to go rock the feather!!</li>
    <li> I sent them to my daughter in studying in Japan. She and everyone else loved them! She gets stopped and asked how to get them.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t do my research on the product, but this was very small. There is five feathers, but they are extremely thin (like, all five feathers don&#x27;t cover a fingernail. If you want them to show a lot, don&#x27;t do these. But they are very high quality and professional, and they do come with things to attach them well, so they&#x27;re alright. The picture is just zoomed in a lot and there isn&#x27;t that many feathers. Actually it&#x27;s a bit disappointing, but oh well. I just would never buy them again.</li>
    <li> This was. terrible waist of money and The picture does not match the description.when I ordered this item I thought that it would be multiple feathers instead its just one strand. I do not regimens this item because of it&#x27;s poor description and lack of directions.</li>
    <li> These extensions where excellent, aside from one feather. One of the feathers had this frizzy puff at the top-it looked like a fluffy new baby bird feather. Anyways, it was very annoying when doing my hair straight for that to be sticking out, I ended up having to cut it down myself. But all others were in excellent condition. I would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> This seller is awesome! I didn&#x27;t buy this color I bought the purples ones last summer and can still reuse my feathers. Its super easy to put in and you can google how to do it if you can&#x27;t figure it out.</li>
    <li> This product definately a great buy for beginers!! I had no idea what tools or items would have been needed.... Honestly! Comes with all the equipment then its pretty self explanitory there after! I did recommend to a GF of mine and she loved it, said it was easy too</li>
    <li> It comes really fast.Really fast. But the amount of feathers here gives an impression that it has lots of feathers, but it doesn&#x27;t really. But it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
    <li> this product came right away. the feathers are very nice and i like that if you dont like them being bonded you can pull them apart so you have five different feathers. they are real feathers and come with instructions. i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These feathers are really cute and look cute. The color is perfect and goes with any outfit. It arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I constantly have feathers in my hair. I liked the striped feather the best. The only issue is that I have long hair so the shorted feather stuck out when my hair was in a pony tail</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had feather extensions from a high end Salon and paid $75 for 5 strands. I was so impressed that the quality of these feathers is on par with what I got from the salon. Wash them, dry them, curl them, flat iron them, the stand up to it all with no special care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So easy to do yourself, and soooo much cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars only because the dark brown micro-bead that was included chipped and flaked after a few shampoos. I ordered a packet of brown micro beads for a few bucks from another company, and they hold up much better. Still a great value, just order your micro beads elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for myself and absolutely loved the feather extension. The extension lasted a while and it wasnt uncomfortable and it was very easy to put in. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love my feather extension! :)</li>
    <li> any bad reviews about this product are just because the person did not read the description. description clearly says it is ONE feather. product came in very good condition, cute packaging and a very nice note from the seller. the price is very good, i&#x27;d even pay more if it was more because the quality is that good. extremely satisfied and will order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Great Feather Sets! Delivered Within 2 Days.&lt;br /&gt;Bought Two Of The Zebra Style And I Love Them! Fantastic Pricing On Them Too!&lt;br /&gt;**Super Satisfied Customer! Definitely Will Be Ordering More!!!**&lt;br /&gt;Thank You For The Awesome Pricing, Fast Delievery And Communication.</li>
    <li> I love these because they always draw interest! They&#x27;re easy to put in yourself (as long as you get the hook) and easy to remove. I reuse them all the time! They stand up to multiple shampoos, conditions, blow dries, hair straightens, and much more!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I was incredibly dissatisfied. The product was far too short and thin to be considered a quality feather extension. It only came with three and a half of another feather. The colors were very dull. The shipping came quickly, though. If you are considering to make this purchase- be wary.</li>
    <li> Not a bad quality, comes with everything you see and is the same color. Wish they were a little thicker and fuller but still, not bad for the price. Arrived on time, perfect condition.</li>
    <li> very fashionable, and fun.  Super easy to install and take out.  lasts a while with careful combing, even used the flat iron on it!</li>
    <li> I got these before by the same company in brown and the brown ones were better quality.  I like them I just am not in love like I was with the brown ones.</li>
    <li> The product came exactly as described. The feathers are beautiful. I wanted feather for a while, but did not have time nor money to go to the salon. I saw feathers that looked horrible at Walmart and cost ten dollars. These were less expensive and look a whole lot better. I would recommend these to anyone who is looked for a less expensive alternative to going to the salon.</li>
    <li> Put these in very easy. Get asked about them all the time. I was surprised how well they&#x27;ve held up to washing, drying and styling. Not interested in streaking or highlighting my hair so these are a great way to add some flare, and you can take them out when you need to or want to change the color.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0052GADTK 8\\&quot; -12\\&quot; in Length Beautiful Natural Beige &amp; Brown Feathers for Hair Extension with Mixes of Browns &amp; Beiges Feathers with Salon Quality 5 Feathers]] Received way earlier than the estimated delivery. Product was exactly as described. When I recieved my items they were packaged with care unlike many sellers. My feathers that I bought have such great quality that I would have paid triple the price. Salon quality! Thanks so much it was exactly what I asked for!</li>
    <li> Only one comes in a package, but it looks pretty.</li>
    <li> II love the product ! Its cute just like 1 feather attached to another.small but ok ..took like 6 days and price is good and way better than spending 15$ at a salon</li>
    <li> I would love to use them more often fun to use. Nice to hide if you need to. Easy to insert.</li>
    <li> THESE are the perfect colors. ARRIVED ON TIME. EASY TO PUT IN HAIR ,WITH THE RIGHT TOOLS ;) Not to many hairdresser have this color anymore, thank you</li>
    <li> Terrible picture is very deceiving , its one noodle size strand of feather that needs another piece just to attach to hair</li>
    <li> My daughter really loves these and gets lots of compliments when wearing them.  I would recommend these for anyone wanting feathers for their hair.</li>
    <li> I like! very beautiful colors, and very good quality. i am very satisfied and i recommend this item! Fast and well-kept service</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these are pretty.  Extreeeemely tiny though--the pic makes them look lush and plentiful.  But the one I got consisted of 4 (not 5 as in the description) very narrow feathers which were on the shorter end. While the price won&#x27;t break the bank, for the quality and size of the feathers, it should have been more like half the asking price.  If you&#x27;re only looking for a very subtle effect then these would suit you.  But if you want something a little longer or thicker, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I WANTED A NEW LOOK SO I CAME ACROSS THESE FEATHERS. I BOUGHT SOME BEFORE I HAD TO GET MORE.. THE ARE MADE WELL .. THE PRICE IS OK.. I AM GOING TO BE BUYING FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN..THIS WAS SHIPPED FAST AND PACKAGED WELL HAPPY FEATHER HUNTING..</li>
    <li> It was a very nice product i just expected a little more than one extension. The picture led me to believe i was getting more. Other than that, the extension looks very pretty</li>
    <li> I have a few thin feathers currently in my hair.  I saw these and had to have them.  Well made and love these particular colors. Can&#x27;t wait to see my hair stylist so she can add them.  Highly recommend these to anyone who wants something different.</li>
    <li> I just received mine, they r thinner then I thought..but overall cute and stylish! Glad it came with to beads a light color and a dark one! I would order more, when these go bad!</li>
    <li> Decent quality and a price you can&#x27;t beat</li>
    <li> A bit pricey. You pay over a dollar for just one little feather. I know this comes with 5 but I think thats a little ridiculous either way. There are way better deals on ebay for big bundles.</li>
    <li> These feathers are very cute and thin. These are also bunched at the top so it is hard to get them apart because they are so thin. Would look really cute all worn together. I noticed when I tried to seperate them at least one did get damaged alittle (still usable)</li>
    <li> the ones pictured are fluffy and black and white.  i only got one black and white one and the other 4 are so scrawny, tiny and thin you can&#x27;t even see them.  very disappointed.  not worth the shipping!</li>
