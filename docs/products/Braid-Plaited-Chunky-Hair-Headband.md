### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This braid is so beautiful!  </li>
      <li>This is absolutely wonderful.</li>
      <li>My band is perfect doesn&#x27;t slip</li>
      <li>Not bobby pins but hair pins work best.</li>
      <li>Perfect color</li>
      <li>Instead I have to clip the hair to it and hope for the best.</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful braid.</li>
      <li>But, all in all, I am quite happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Looks best woven into your own hair (so that it blends in), instead of being a stand-alone hairpiece.</li>
      <li>Love this!!</li>
      <li>good buy for the money,if it was without the band or it was covered ,it would be better,one piece no elastic</li>
      <li>an color is good</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>Weave some of your own hair in it using a darning hook.</li>
      <li>It was the perfect color it match my hair very well.</li>
      <li>so is best used intwined with your own natural hair.</li>
      <li>It is a lovely product.</li>
      <li>its ok.</li>
      <li>Gray hair tends to more coarseness</li>
      <li>So glad I got 2.</li>
      <li>It will take time and skill to make the most of this braid.</li>
      <li>It is a very nicely done braid, but really noticeable that this is synthetic hair.</li>
      <li>braid can easily be used as a wrap around for a bun and looks really nice that way, but needs to be an EXACT MATCH for your own hair color and texture if used this way - if not, it will stick out like a sore thumb.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, but the ends of it are chunky, so you&#x27;ll need enough hair (or a scarf) to be able to cover up the ends.  </li>
      <li>Lots of fun and easy way to not have to do hair.</li>
      <li>It works nicely as a headband and adds a look of thickness to hair that is not very thick.</li>
      <li>I had seen the braids as an accessary and it is so nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I love my new silver gray headband.</li>
      <li>I just wish it were more like a headband than an elastic piece that goes completely around my head.</li>
      <li>The color is a good match for my own hair, but since the texture of this braid is HEAVY, SILKY, AND COMPLETELY STRAIGHT, it doesn&#x27;t really look natural up against my baby fine, curly hair and really, REALLY needs to be woven in to prevent it from looking</li>
      <li>but I really hoped to be able to just put on the hairband,let my natural hair falldown over the sides and go.</li>
      <li>But in skilled hands, it has great potential to make thin, fine hair seem thicker and prettier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: it is pretty, well made and</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough I love it</li>
      <li>I can only use it within an elaborate undo, using LOTS of bobby pins and interweaving.</li>
      <li>I will try and experiment a bit more with styles that could wrap my hair through the back of the band</li>
      <li>the hairs on the top (front) of the headband are loose and there&#x27;s no way to fix it.  </li>
      <li>My head is large and it is a little tight, I may have to work on it, but it looked good with my hair, wore it once and enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>As a result I&#x27;m not wearing it as much as I would like.</li>
      <li>made very well</li>
      <li>hair fibers in this braid are silky and slippery, so I cannot use it very well as a head band.</li>
      <li>the whole hairband should have been a a whole braid.</li>
      <li>I really like the colour and the quality</li>
      <li>Weaving it into your own hair is time consuming and takes some skill, so I won&#x27;t be getting a lot of everyday use from it.</li>
      <li>very pretty but somewhat short</li>
      <li>it would probably be too tight, which is the problem I find with most headbands, because I wear glasses.</li>
      <li>Even though my hair is much longer the white connecting material pieces at the back are easily visible when the hair moves naturally.</li>
      <li>It just stops at a certain point and remains quite chunky where it is chopped off and the white material begins..</li>
      <li>Since I haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of interweaving yet, I am still in the practice stage and will take some time before I&#x27;m ready to appear in public with this on.</li>
      <li>Wish it had 3&amp;#34; more of the braid, as it barely makes it behind my ears.</li>

<li> If u feel it&#x27;s too shines use some hair spray and that tones it down.</li>

<li> but needs a little bit of texture to the fiber of the braid.  </li>
<li> but unfortunately it is quite difficult to disguise the white material at the back as the plaiting doesn&#x27;t gradually taper down into the material.</li>

<li> My hair is very thin, so it isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>

    <li> This braid is so beautiful!  It works nicely as a headband and adds a look of thickness to hair that is not very thick.</li>
    <li> It comes with white elastic as the headband part.  My head is large and it is a little tight, I may have to work on it, but it looked good with my hair, wore it once and enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> Lots of fun and easy way to not have to do hair.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely wonderful. So glad I got 2. My band is perfect doesn&#x27;t slip but I use a couple of hair pins. Not bobby pins but hair pins work best. Next. Weave some of your own hair in it using a darning hook. If u feel it&#x27;s too shines use some hair spray and that tones it down. Can&#x27;t say enough I love it</li>
    <li> too small for my large head - should be adjustable.  pics should only show the product, not a nice hairdo with a braid.  the hairs on the top (front) of the headband are loose and there&#x27;s no way to fix it.  It&#x27;s very very chunk and thick.</li>
    <li> it is not what i thought it would be...and i am not happy...I would return but because of the policy i cant.</li>
    <li> good buy for the money,if it was without the band or it was covered ,it would be better,one piece no elastic</li>
    <li> Perfect color but needs a little bit of texture to the fiber of the braid.  Gray hair tends to more coarseness this is extra silky.</li>
    <li> its ok. not what i expected. the white elastic should have been cover with grey hair. the whole hairband should have been a a whole braid.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, but the ends of it are chunky, so you&#x27;ll need enough hair (or a scarf) to be able to cover up the ends.  My hair is very thin, so it isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>

    <li> This is a beautiful braid. I had a hard time finding a white one to match my hair. I had seen the braids as an accessary and it is so nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom. Nice. Took awhile to learn how to place them in her hair.</li>
    <li> very pretty but somewhat short so it rides up and you have to pull it back in place  made very well an color is good</li>
    <li> It is a very nicely done braid, but really noticeable that this is synthetic hair. Looks best woven into your own hair (so that it blends in), instead of being a stand-alone hairpiece. Weaving it into your own hair is time consuming and takes some skill, so I won&#x27;t be getting a lot of everyday use from it. I do wish they would post an instructional video so that I could make it look like the ad photo in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This braid can easily be used as a wrap around for a bun and looks really nice that way, but needs to be an EXACT MATCH for your own hair color and texture if used this way - if not, it will stick out like a sore thumb. The color is a good match for my own hair, but since the texture of this braid is HEAVY, SILKY, AND COMPLETELY STRAIGHT, it doesn&#x27;t really look natural up against my baby fine, curly hair and really, REALLY needs to be woven in to prevent it from looking fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair fibers in this braid are silky and slippery, so I cannot use it very well as a head band. It slips off my head within (literally) seconds of being put on. I can only use it within an elaborate undo, using LOTS of bobby pins and interweaving. Since I haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of interweaving yet, I am still in the practice stage and will take some time before I&#x27;m ready to appear in public with this on. But in skilled hands, it has great potential to make thin, fine hair seem thicker and prettier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it is pretty, well made and the volume is generous and chunky. The fibers look synthetic so is best used intwined with your own natural hair. It will take time and skill to make the most of this braid.</li>
    <li> I like it.  It is well made and matches my hair color well, but I do have to say I wish the elastic was shorter and not white - It is hard to conceal it.  I wish they made a braid that was hair all the way around.</li>
    <li> It was the perfect color it match my hair very well.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Wish it had 3&amp;#34; more of the braid, as it barely makes it behind my ears. I have a big head, however.</li>
