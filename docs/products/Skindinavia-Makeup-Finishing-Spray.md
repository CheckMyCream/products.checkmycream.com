      <li>I&#x27;m not too happy about it</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>This spray is amazing!</li>
      <li>I applied it around 7 a.m. and by 6 p.m. when I got home my makeup still looked good.</li>
      <li>In love with it!</li>
      <li>The finishing spray sets my make-up and makes my skin look amazing.</li>
      <li>still using it till this day and it works great on anyone face free oil and as described yeah h</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used both and own both and see no difference in performance.</li>
      <li>My skin is very oily and I was impressed when I looked at myself in the mirror after so many hours</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love that it keeps my makeup on all day.</li>
      <li>4/17/2012:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for several days and it is awesome!</li>
      <li>try the bridal it works way better for those with oily skin</li>
      <li>I will update my review in a month or two to revise the product once more.</li>
      <li>Now my make up looks just as good at the end of the day as it does first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>However the Clarins one is simply better and sets my make up longer much to my dismay !!</li>
      <li>&#x27;s what I do for such great staying power:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks to my friends for telling me Skindinavia&#x27;s Make Up Finishing Spray is a MUST TRY!!!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go!  &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>MAC&#x27;s fix + spray and my make up doesn&#x27;t fade, doesn&#x27;t look patchy, just looks clean and serene!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I live in Portland and even going from the apartment to the car or from the car to work out in the rain, my makeup is fine &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>my make up didn&#x27;t stay fresh all day</li>
      <li>It is the most vital step in my make-up application.</li>
      <li>So far so good, if the product continues to work for me I will definitely repurchase.</li>
      <li>so this is a great alternative to sticking with the Urban Decay name and spending the extra bucks.</li>
      <li>After doing some more research I saw Skindinavia has packaged the spray in the same bottle as the one I have.</li>
      <li>and it never fails me.</li>
      <li>Now that I have discovered what Make Up Finishing Spray actually does ... my morning routine is not done until I&#x27;ve given the quick four pumps of fine mist.</li>
      <li>It really works....</li>
      <li>As of right now it definitely helps adhere my make up and seal it, exactly as the product claims to do.</li>
      <li>more, same company but the Urban Decay</li>
      <li>This spray is ok, I actually prefer the Urban Decay</li>
      <li>There is an interesting scent accompanied with it, but nothing too harsh or unmanageable.</li>
      <li>Really recommend it especially for the hot summer days.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to sweat, or pat my face dry.</li>
      <li>This stay on makeup spray is so settle and soft.</li>
      <li>Skindinavia is generally  cheaper</li>
      <li>Since the product has worked so far, I figure the seller from whom I received the spray from must have bought a mass quantity awhile back, before the changed the look of the label.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work as I expected it ....</li>
      <li>Urban Decay is a subsidiary of Skindinavia, so the products are nearly identical in formula.</li>
      <li>The only reason I was skeptical initially is because when the package arrived, the bottle was covered in bubble wrap and not in its own box or anything.</li>
      <li>I got married a few weeks ago in the Florida summer heat.</li>

    <li> This stay on makeup spray is so settle and soft. Does not feel sticky! In love with it! Really recommend it especially for the hot summer days.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, which I don&#x27;t mind because I like the matte finish makeup. This gave me a dewy almost shiny finish. I didn&#x27;t care for that part of it, but it does keep my make up in place. If you struggle with shine order the one of oily skin.</li>
    <li> great spray! I love that it keeps my makeup on all day. I spray it on my face after I put on my foundation and then put setting powder for a matte face. If I want it dewy then I just use the spray after the setting powder.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I&#x27;ve only used the product 3 times now as I only received it 3 days ago. As of right now it definitely helps adhere my make up and seal it, exactly as the product claims to do. There is an interesting scent accompanied with it, but nothing too harsh or unmanageable. I will update my review in a month or two to revise the product once more. The only reason I was skeptical initially is because when the package arrived, the bottle was covered in bubble wrap and not in its own box or anything. The label looked unscathed, but having this be the first time I purchased this particular make up setting spray, I had no way of telling if it was a fake. Also, the black label was not the one stuck to my bottle, it was white/silver/baby blue. After doing some more research I saw Skindinavia has packaged the spray in the same bottle as the one I have. Since the product has worked so far, I figure the seller from whom I received the spray from must have bought a mass quantity awhile back, before the changed the look of the label. So far so good, if the product continues to work for me I will definitely repurchase. I simply spray about 4-5 pumps once all my makeup has been applied and touch up later in the day with MAC&#x27;s fix + spray and my make up doesn&#x27;t fade, doesn&#x27;t look patchy, just looks clean and serene!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/17/2012:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for several days and it is awesome! The product is legit and my makeup is flawless all day! Unless I rub olive oil on my face, my foundation/eye makeup is sticking on. I live in Portland and even going from the apartment to the car or from the car to work out in the rain, my makeup is fine &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> My mother gave me this product after she bought it and didn&#x27;t like it. I have been using it ever since! It is the most vital step in my make-up application. The finishing spray sets my make-up and makes my skin look amazing. I can&#x27;t do my make-up without it!</li>
    <li> Works just like it says!  My T-zone is very oily and I&#x27;m usually a shiny mess after a few hours.  This finishing spray keeps me &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; looking all day and doesn&#x27;t matte my face the same way oil blotters do (causing me to look dry and cakey).  Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I returned this product after one use.  Not only does it NOT help in making your make up last longer but it makes it worse.  It made my makeup look cakey and did not nothing to preserve it.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Let me just start off by saying I work a job that has a ton of heavy lifting, sweating, and dusty areas. My makeup NEVER budges when I use this spray. I&#x27;m not afraid to sweat, or pat my face dry. This stuff is a miracle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I do for such great staying power:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I moisturize, and prime my face. I allow the two to dry before applying my foundation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I apply my foundation, I spritz my face and then allow the products to dry. I then do my eyes, my brows, and my lashes and concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then use a face powder(light application), contour, blush, and spritz my face again and I&#x27;m ready to go!  &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I wanted to really love this spray, because its less expensive than the Clarins one I am currently using. However the Clarins one is simply better and sets my make up longer much to my dismay !!&lt;br /&gt;I bought the bridal version, and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t say that its awful ; it just doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I am used to setting spray lasting.</li>
    <li> This spray is amazing! I got married a few weeks ago in the Florida summer heat. With an outdoor wedding, I was concerned about my makeup melting off!  It protected my makeup through day and night and I have the pictures to prove it!! I&#x27;m a pharmaceutical rep for work, in and out of my car in the heat all day. I&#x27;ve been using it since my wedding and have seen such a difference in my make up lasting all day and into the night! Skindinavia is the best!!</li>
    <li> It really works.... I applied it around 7 a.m. and by 6 p.m. when I got home my makeup still looked good. My skin is very oily and I was impressed when I looked at myself in the mirror after so many hours and It looked like I was wearing makeup for around 4. I used before lipstick and mascara.</li>
    <li> I ordered the bridal setting spray and recieved this one instead which I&#x27;m not too happy about it does nothing for my oily skin I actually think it made it worse.... no point of using it because I end up wiping off all my makeup because I&#x27;m constantly blotting oil off my face all day.... try the bridal it works way better for those with oily skin</li>
    <li> still using it till this day and it works great on anyone face free oil and as described yeah h</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Keeps my makeup from going anywhere. I use this every time I go out at night and it never fails me. No drugstore setting sprays compare.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer to anyone out there considering this or Urban Decay DeSlick. Urban Decay is a subsidiary of Skindinavia, so the products are nearly identical in formula. I&#x27;ve used both and own both and see no difference in performance. Skindinavia is generally  cheaper so this is a great alternative to sticking with the Urban Decay name and spending the extra bucks.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work as I expected it ....my make up didn&#x27;t stay fresh all day and it didn&#x27;t give me a matte finish that I desired</li>
    <li> This spray is ok, I actually prefer the Urban Decay All Nighter Spray more, same company but the Urban Decay one for some reason lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Thanks to my friends for telling me Skindinavia&#x27;s Make Up Finishing Spray is a MUST TRY!!! No more worrying about my eyeshadow creasing ... or my eyeliner ending up in the middle of my eyelids. Now that I have discovered what Make Up Finishing Spray actually does ... my morning routine is not done until I&#x27;ve given the quick four pumps of fine mist. Now my make up looks just as good at the end of the day as it does first thing in the morning. Yay!</li>
