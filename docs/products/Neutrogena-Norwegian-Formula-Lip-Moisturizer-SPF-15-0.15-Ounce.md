<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very hydrating lip balm .... I put this before I go to sleep and underneath my drying matte lipsticks.</li>
    <li> I debated stocking up since this has been my one and only chapstick, but the ewg site gives it a bad score because it contains oxybenzone. Apparently that is a pretty toxic thing, and it is absorbed through your skin - not nice since I&#x27;ve been putting it on my lips daily for YEARS now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m on the search for a new chapstick that is safer but works as well as this one did. If anyone finds one (no fragrance please) then let me know! Neutrogena is making a natural lip balm without spf that rates highly on ewg, but I&#x27;d really prefer something with spf (as long as it isn&#x27;t oxybenzone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: I ordered the Beyond Coastal lip balm with SPF. I don&#x27;t love it as much (softer than the Neutrogena so I feel like it won&#x27;t last as long), but I think it will work fine. I also ordered the Neutrogena naturals without spf to use at night and when I won&#x27;t be outdoors. I really like the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that there is research on animals that suggests problems with oxybenzone, but the negative results were mostly obtained when the rats were given the chemical orally. While there may not be evidence that enough is absorbed through the skin to cause problems. I still think it&#x27;s prudent to avoid putting it on your mouth regularly.</li>
    <li> This lip moisturizer has staying power and isn&#x27;t waxy like some.</li>
    <li> I love this lip product!  It&#x27;s hard to find and I have tried others and don&#x27;t like any of them as well as this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what all the glowing reviews are about. I bought this after reading all the reviews because I was curious to try it out. There is nothing special about this Chapstick and I do not find my lips to be all that more moisturized after I use it. It wasn&#x27;t expensive so no love lost but I would not order again.</li>
    <li> I love that this lip balm is long-lasting, flavorless, and tasteless.  It works well and the SPF 15 is a great bonus!</li>
    <li> The only chapstick my sensitive  lips can tolerate.  It&#x27;s the best of the best as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I keep coming back for more.</li>
    <li> Tried many different brands and types of chapstick and finally decided to try Nuetrogena. Loved it a lot, what makes it amazing is how simple it is. No special chemicals that claims to do this and that to your lips. Fragrant free, conditions the lips effectively as it claims, and best of all does not give your lips that waxy slippery feeling you get from other well-known brands. Simply dab a little on and instantly forget you even applied chapstick. Helped my lips through the winter, the added spf 15 will help it during the summer. Highly recommend this product and will definitely be stocking up on these myself.</li>
    <li> nice product. came in a nice package and works great for dry lips</li>
    <li> Disappointed in it after all the great reviews. It has a taste/smell I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Does a great job in moisturizing the lips and does not feel icky or thick on the lips. This is coming from a person with always cracked lips, summer and winter. after a week of using the problem has gone and i dont find myself with dead dried skin on my lips every day. I am glad i tried this</li>
    <li> Good for your lips. :)</li>
    <li> Keeps lips feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Great pack to protect your lips - works well and lasts long. I am very happy with it! Great price.</li>
    <li> Great product and delivered on time!</li>
    <li> I read all the great reviews for this product before purchasing and after trying it out, I agree with them.  NO waxy feel, no flaking off, no smell or taste...lips feel very good both with it on and after it wears off.  I was one of those people who realized several years ago that the more I used lip balm (and I tried a ton of brands) that the more my lips dried out when I wasn&#x27;t wearing it...so I stopped.  But then, there went my SPF for my lips...and I&#x27;ve had more than one sun-related lesion removed from them over the years.  So I started using the tinted Neutrogena formula (SPF 20)...but I don&#x27;t always want a tint.  And then saw this Norwegian formula with it&#x27;s glowing reviews.  This balm has a very light feel as well, which I really like.  I was outdoors for 3 hours last night and at the end of the night (after much talking) I could still feel this balm.  And my lips still felt protected and moist.  It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> my wife like it very much.so if I will buy after it.thank you very much about this goods.thank you !</li>
    <li> Not the best I have used and more expensive.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products in the lip balm category, and most of them have let me down. As a male, I don&#x27;t care for the usually disgusting fruity varieties. All I want is something that moisturizes, protects, and relieves my lips without being distracting. The Neutrogena Norwegian Forumula Lip Moisturizer does all of the above. It feels very smooth and thin and you forget that you have it on. The SPF 15 is essential for anti-aging too. I recommend buying this lip moisturizer if you want great results without the distractions of the other brands.</li>
    <li> Probably the nicest lip moisturizer I own.  As with most Neutrogena products there is no fragrance.  Leaves your lips nice and soft. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best lip moisturizer that I have ever tried, and I think I have tried them all!</li>
    <li> My favorite lip crap. No taste, nice and clean. Moisturizes really well. I love all Neutrogena products! The s***e is the balm.</li>
    <li> The best lip balm so far when it comes to moisturizing my lips. The others just don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I rate this like all of the lip moisturizer I have used for lips-just ok. It was nothing spectacular.I would have thought the brand was better than others in the same category.</li>
    <li> Really nice product. Keeps my lips soft and smooth even during the cold dry PA winter.</li>
    <li> The best lip balm I have found for my sesitive lips, and lasts longer than any other lip moisturizer I have found.</li>
    <li> I love this! We have a big family &amp; we can&#x27;t have enough of this around the house!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere locally. I really wanted to try it after reading awesome reviews &amp; because I love the hand cream in this collection. That&#x27;s HG but this isn&#x27;t quite as great. One of my favorites though</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used, period!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! No flavour, very&lt;br /&gt;moisturize and SPF15! Perfect! It&#x27;s a bit expensive though. Never mind! I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years and years.</li>
    <li> This are the only lip balm that I will use. I mean that literally. When I&#x27;ve bought other balms, I find them too waxy, or gooey, or stinky. I generally use them a couple of times, and then they go into limbo in my purse, never to be seen again. I actually use the Neutrogena until I scrape the dregs out of the tube, leaving it clean as a whistle. I use it at night before going to bed and again in the morning. That&#x27;s it, and my lips feel and look great. I&#x27;m 57, and my lips look 27! Okay, I&#x27;m exaggerating a bit. They look more like 47, but they are smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Not exactly like the European formula I got in Belgium, but close. Wish it were identical.</li>
    <li> Love these and especially &#x27;cos they do not have a &amp;#34;Flavor&amp;#34; of any kind that makes me lick my lips more than usual. That makes them dry again faster than normal.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because it was practical, didn&#x27;t have much faith he would constantly wear it but as it turns out, he won&#x27;t leave the house without it...</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I have always had fairly dry lips and it has been a challenge to keep them moisturized. I&#x27;ve tried Burts Bees and multitudes of other lip balm brands but I think this is the one. It creates a nice layer on the lips and feels pleasantly balmy, not heavy or thick. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent but more importantly it doesn&#x27;t have a taste if it gets in your mouth, which is a huge plus for me. I apply it throughout the day but I lay it on thick at night and my lips are super soft when I wake up. I have three tubes now that I keep in various places. I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> It really is scentless!  I find this product very moisturizing, and I did not need to reapply it as often as I would for most other lip balms.</li>
    <li> Great service!  I LOVE Neutrogena Lip Moisturizer.  Some moisturizing products for the lips do not prevent the lips from drying.  I&#x27;ve tried many, and have found that Neutrogena Lip Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Marian Woloson  mwoloson@gmail.com</li>
    <li> This moisturizer feels good on the lips, goes on smoothly and  lasts for a reasonable time.  Also, it seems to work with my  Cover Girl Outlast Lipstick which is a drying type of lipstick.  I like it.</li>
    <li> This has been the best chapstick for both my daughter and I. Goes on great, coats perfectly and helps heal and protect. We keep it in our bags, car and coat pockets all the time.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective lip moisturizer I&#x27;ve found for dry, sensitive lips. I&#x27;ve had the same patch of dry, irritated skin on one lip for the two years. Other products would make it feel better, but it never went away. Blistex has a Cold &amp; Allergy lipbalm that worked well but was very waxy. This product moisturizes and soothes, has no smell or taste whatsoever, and barely feels like there&#x27;s anything there. These are the best results I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a baker, and I have eczema - though it is pretty mild/moderate. I have been through many, many kinds of chapsticks and moisturizers. Nothing worked. Including Burt&#x27;s Bees, Trader Johann&#x27;s Virtuoso, Carmex, Chapstick brand, and basically everything you can find at a pharmacy. Nothing worked especially on my days at work where I&#x27;m around heat (stepping into large ovens) and flour which is tough on the skin and ESPECIALLY on my lips. It hurt to smile, and I was always licking my lips. I was always applying my chapstick several times an hour, and it made things worse or didn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried this stuff. It takes me 4x as long to go through a stick than any other sticks I&#x27;ve used. I use it maybe 3 times during my shift at the most, compared to previous lip products that I would apply 15-30 times a night. It lasts and it really works. I can smile, I don&#x27;t feel a waxy buildup, and my lips feel soft. It moistens but not to the point where you feel a greasy layer - moreso you forget that you ever put something on your lips at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a life/lip-saver. Anyone dealing with less extremes (no skin problems, and not standing in a 400 degree oven) will probably feel the results even more than I did. If you work in the sun, heat, dry or cold weather, buy this. It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> No smell or fragrance like others. It is small and lightweight. No weird taste.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this lip balm: It&#x27;s not greasy. It doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel tingly. It has no scent. It has no taste. It doesn&#x27;t look glossy. It&#x27;s got sunscreen. It feels lightweight. It keeps my lips from cracking and feeling dry. It lasts forever. And (icing on the cake), the package is plain... not all jazzed up or girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides my wallet and my cellphone, this is the only other object that is on my person during nearly every waking hour of my life.</li>
    <li> This a great lip balm with built in sun protection. No strong odors or flavors, but excellent long lasting protection.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!! It&#x27;s the only lip moisturizer that works for me. It is sooo much better than Chapstick in my opinion. I apply it every night and lips rarely get dry or cracked. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It protects my lips against the sun. But I do not like the taste that I get from it.</li>
    <li> This is a great lip balm, I&#x27;d definitely order more, shipped fast. It&#x27;s smooth and not greasy at all, moisturizers nicely, thank you!</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm.</li>
    <li> This is the best chap stick I&#x27;ve used so far. I got it in a package deal at Sam&#x27;s Club. I ran out, i had to get more. This is the only one I will buy Anymore.</li>
    <li> Should have read ingredients more closely - hate petrolatum</li>
    <li> We first bought this for my daughter as it was recommended by her flute teacher, and it is one of the best I have ever used (plus, I&#x27;m not allergic to it.)</li>
    <li> Neutrogena makes solid skin care products and this is no exception.  It goes on smooth without leaving a mess or feeling sticky.  Moisturizes well and also has SPF.  Not much more you can want out of lip balm.</li>
    <li> Agree with last two. This brand is the best because it has no taste or perfume or sickly fruit flavors. Also not too dry. Been using for years. Buy several at a time. Sometimes can find in stores, sometimes not. Not this year. Glad to find it here.</li>
    <li> No scent or flavor. No color. Not oily or tacky. Feels soothing. And it has SPF protection, which is important for cancer prevention! Sounds so simple, but this is the only lip balm I&#x27;ve found that has all of these characteristics, which is exactly what I want.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of different kinds, types, and brands of lip moisturizers over the last 30 years.  About 7 years I discovered Neutrogena lip moisturizer, and I have used it exclusively since then.  It is sometimes hard to find in retail stores, so I often buy 7-10 at a time at Amazon.  It does what it is supposed to (moisturize and soften dry lips) without giving my lips that waxy feeling that many products do.  I don&#x27;t need to constantly reapply it; it stays on my lips for a longer period of time than other moisturizers did.</li>
    <li> I love it! My lips get very cracked in the dry winter time, and I go around with  lips bleeding unless I put something on them... but until now, no matter WHAT I put on them, it just didn&#x27;t last. All the other products I tried didn&#x27;t last longer than thirty minutes, before my lips started flaking again.  This one does the job! Even when my lips are already severely cracked, just put this moisturizer stick on and in a couple of seconds my mouth is free to make whatever shape it wants to. And it lasts longer than other products. A keeper! :)</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t find a better Chapstick that last you Months. I&#x27;m still on my first stick and i&#x27;m the hot sun it doesn&#x27;t melt. It left my lips healthy, smooth, and might have even taken some wrinkle away!</li>
    <li> Went through two sticks already and I absolutely love it. Will definitely by again. Works very well even in the sun.</li>
    <li> buy tons and tons of these love this product</li>
    <li> have tried alot of lip moisturizers, this one tends to stay longer, and isn&#x27;t greasy or slimy. i don&#x27;t like scented, this doesn&#x27;t have an odor</li>
    <li> I ordered the pack of two, one for me and one for my mom. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more when it runs out. While I normally love the kind that smells nice, I hate the taste. And this doesn&#x27;t smell OR TASTE like anything and I actually love that. I&#x27;ve had it on for an hour now and it hasn&#x27;t gone away. Doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s going to disappear! But it definitely absorbed a bit within 5 minutes! It&#x27;s sooo soft and moisturizing. I&#x27;m in love! I also love that it has sunblock in it, to protect my lips. For $4.99 with FREE 2 day shipping [prime users], A TWO PACK IS A MUST HAVE!&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I know it doesn&#x27;t taste like anything, but somehow the fragrance-free stuff gives me a headache! It doesn&#x27;t last very much so I wear it under my old ChapStick cherry chapstick with my lipstick over it. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a good idea but it doesn&#x27;t last long! Oh well, it does moisturize rather quickly but my cherry chapstick might moisturize even faster than this! Sorry guys. Hope it works for you!</li>
    <li> i like it. It doesnt smell like anything and it keeps my lips hydrated. I bought it here because i cant find it in my local pharmacies.</li>
    <li> My lips chap easily, so I use lip balm quite often.  I&#x27;ve used quite a few different varieties.  This brand doesn&#x27;t really stand out over other brands.  In fact it seems much more prone to breaking apart, which sometimes happens with solid lip balm if you apply to much pressure when the lip balm is warm.  It seems to work about as well as other types of lip balm for healing; works great for short term relief, but doesn&#x27;t seem to affect long term healing much (beyond making you less likely too lick your lips of coarse!).  I will say though, that the container is a bit of an improvement over the typical variety.  It turns at the top around the cap rather than at the bottom.  Other brands of lip balm tend to eject themselves over time in my pockets because the knob turns as I move, the result can be messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, other than the brand name, this isn&#x27;t offering much more than the brands you will find at your local grocery.</li>
    <li> Good but has a weirded scent</li>
    <li> It makes my lips dry actually... I have no idea what Norwegian formula is, but it seems like this formula doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
    <li> We had an unnaturally cold and dry winter this year, and I could not keep my lips moisturized with the chapstick I had (Nivea). I started looking online and saw the awesome reviews for this product, and decided to give it a shot! I found it a little amusing that it is a Norwegian formula, as I love Norway and visited last December with my boyfriend. Citizens are much more adapted to the cold than Alabamians, and this chapstick is proof! It keeps my lips feeling soft all day long and healed my already cracked lips. This stuff is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I recently ran out of this stuff.  For the past month I have been using other lip balms.  They do NOT compare whatsoever.  For the first time in several years, my lips are cracking and bleeding.  I always had a good supply before.  I am so glad I found these on Amazon, because I cannot locate them in the local stores in my area!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin (psoriasis and eczema), and I love this product. It keeps my lips from getting chapped without irritating my skin.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Does not leave any cheap flavor. Comes in a cool looking tube. Lasts a while. I dig it.</li>
    <li> I thought these were much larger than they actually were not my favorite</li>
    <li> DOES A GREAT JOB  FOR DRY LIPS.</li>
    <li> Love love this lip balm.  Very allergic to almost all other brands.</li>
    <li> This product is a great moisturizing lip balm.  The price for pkg. of 2 Neutrogena lip balms was good.  Item was shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with this purchase - Thanks.</li>
    <li> This lip balm works very well. 99% of lip balms does not work for me and I am glad I found this. It is not sticky and there is no scent to it, which is a plus. If you have dry lips, buy this!</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena lip moisturizer. It&#x27;s very hard to find, to buy. I am not sure why the stores don&#x27;t sell it anymore. It&#x27;s the best!!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product, if you don&#x27;t like a thick, waxy residue. Goes on clean, absorbs quickly, actually moisturizes, and SPF. Simple and therapeutic. Love it.</li>
    <li> I used these because they have spf in them and they made my lips so chapped. Applying more only made it worse.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> this lip moisturizer, has no flavor, and containes SPF 15,  Just what i want in a lip moisturizer.  It is very hard to find in the stores, but amazon.com always has it available for my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena Norwegian Lip Moisturizer with SPF 15, I wear this moisturizer whenever I&#x27;m in the sun, I worry about too much sun on my lips, I even wear it while skiing, I&#x27;m never in the sun without my Neutrogena Lip Moisturizer with SPF 15, it works very well for me. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I must say, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed after reading all of the rave reviews. This stuff is okay. It moisturizes decently, but not as well as Burt&#x27;s Bees, Carmex, Korres or Kiehl&#x27;s chapsticks. I&#x27;ve used this in cold weather and warm weather, while skiing or a day of classes, and I feel like it is gone after 5 minutes. It certainly doesn&#x27;t help heal severely chapped lips. I usually like Neutrogena products, and I usually trust Amazon reviews, but I am very disappointed with this.</li>
    <li> Now I tried a lot of lip balms: burt&#x27;s bees, carmex, chapstick, EOS, blixtex. However, all of them seem to leave a residue. I&#x27;ve narrow down my two favorite lip balm to Natural Ice and now, this Neutrogena one. They both don&#x27;t leave a residue and I&#x27;m not allergic to them as I am to Burt&#x27;s Bees. A negative of this chapstick would be that it is fragile and not as &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; as the other brand. If you twist them up, sometimes they don&#x27;t come back down. However, the quality of this brand beats all. No taste or smell or anything.</li>
    <li> So this is the only chapstick I could ever possibly use!  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor or overriding flavor!  It works great on my lips and now I am addicted... I&#x27;ve been addicted to this product for the past 14 years... thank goodness Amazon offers this product!  It&#x27;s not too wet, not too dry.... I just love it!</li>
    <li> nice lip moisturizer. works well. I hate to write reviews so just let me say I like this product and will probably never write another review.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip moisturizer for dry lips in both hot and cold weather.  On time delivery to my home is great.  Amazon has the best business model for customers.</li>
    <li> My favorite chap stick by far. It heals my lips without any sting or without it caking on my lips. Its by far the best lip balm!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Neutrogena chap-stick every since I was young (so maybe 20 years now...) I love it. It&#x27;s very moisturizing without being greasy or having a gross taste/flavor. It works really well at keeping my lips soft!</li>
    <li> very nice, smooths my lips very well. only bad thing is it doesnt have a sweet sense an taste like sunscreen.</li>
    <li> When I went abroad for college &amp; work, this was the only lip moisterizer that both worked, and didn&#x27;t feel like dry wax on my miserable chapped winter lips. Unfortunately they didn&#x27;t sell it where I was and international shipping was expensive then, so I had my mother mail me a couple sticks with packages from home. &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> great as lip moisturizer and sun block.&lt;br /&gt;does not deteriorate over time as chapstick sometimes&lt;br /&gt;does. not cheap but all the neutragena products are&lt;br /&gt;quality products.</li>
    <li> I really like this lip balm and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores so when I found it here on amazon I was thrilled. When it arrived only one of the lip balm dispensers worked (two to a pack). I plan to scoop out the lip balm from the defective one and mash it into a tiny empty jar of some sort but for now I am using the one that works. I would have given it 5 stars if both lip balms dispensed properly, otherwise the product itself works great.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Really protects my lips from dryness and chapping.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip moisturizer - bar none! It&#x27;s all natural, and you don&#x27;t have to apply it 10 times a day. I keep one in my purse and on my beside table. I can&#x27;t go to sleep without it. It&#x27;s just not easy to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Really useful in winter.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and postage! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The formula has changed.  I know because I still have a tube of stuff from the way-back-when and it&#x27;s literal magic when it comes to chapped lips.  Is this type still good?  Yes.  Buy it.  I love Neutrogena&#x27;s formula, because unlike Burt&#x27;s Bees and the chapstick brand, your lips don&#x27;t get drier and drier the more you use it.  2 or 3 applications and my chapped lips are healed.  If I know I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun a lot or on the mountain, I put some on preventatively and life is good.  Ive also used it under my nose post illness to get rid of chapped skin with good results.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s only a vague waxy taste to it, but it&#x27;s not oily or greasy and doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all.  I recommend this to everyone and anyone.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is almost as wonderful as their Norwegian hand cream (which is the best), now I have two favorites neutrogena products</li>
    <li> Best lip balm around.  Makes your lips soft but doesn&#x27;t dry out. Despite a chapstick/ lip gloss fetish, this is the only brand I am using right now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. Feels like cheap Chapstick. It shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> very smooth and feels great</li>
    <li> Best lip moisturizer you can buy. I need the SPF. My lips always get blisters if I don&#x27;t use Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I have tried no less than 20 different lip moisturizing products for 15 years now so I was very happy that these work as well as they do for me. I have extremely dried lips and I have found moisturizers that work for about an hour after I put them on but then I have to keep reapplying every couple of hours or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these Neutrogena chapsticks, I only have to apply them once in the morning, after I brush my teeth and shower, and once more at night before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is literally THE best lip moisturizing product that I&#x27;ve came across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful though, this product does contain Octinoxate and Oxybenzone which some people are allergic to. The warning IS on the label but here it is again: Discontinue use if signs of irritation or rash appear!</li>
    <li> I love this product and is extremely difficult to find locally. It works as a lip balm and lovely gloss. My favorite lip product.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice.  It feels wonderful on my lips. I can&#x27;t do heavy perfumes or flavors so this product is an A+.</li>
    <li> The best Chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s seriously the only one that works for me. I have severely chapped lips all year round that peel everyday. They are sore and sting with any other Chapstick I use. I&#x27;ve gone to a dermatologist and he recommended aquafor but it didn&#x27;t help. This stuff has worked wonders and doesn&#x27;t make my lips sting. It softens my lips and instantly makes them feel so moisturized. Neutrogena also makes a tinted chapstick if you want color which is also pretty good that I found at Walmart. I hope this product never gets discontinued! My lips finally feel amazing right now.</li>
    <li> To keep it plain and simple, I&#x27;m not a professional expert about chapsticks, but Ive gone most of my life always having dry lips no matter what other products Ive used. This chapstick is the only one that makes my lips actually feel like I have a nice pair of lips.</li>
    <li> I used to suffer chapped lips for years. Just give this a try. And it works great for me! One apply can last for several hours (between daily meals). One week passed, and now my lips stopped chapping completely.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve found. Sometimes other balms make my lips feel even more chapped than they were before. No more chapped lips! I love it!</li>
    <li> Works great. I have sensitive skin and my face burns easy. This stuff works good for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip moisturizer I have been able to find. The product lasts a long time without having to continuously reapply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lip balm since high school and love the feeling of this product~ It&#x27;s with SPF and not oily on my lip.</li>
    <li> why did I waste years on chapstick?&lt;br /&gt;most amazing and works in cold, dry , wet , any condtions.&lt;br /&gt;I am fair and 52, love it. love it!</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended, Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Lip Moisturizer, is the best lip therapy I have found to treat the dryness that&#x27;s inevitable with winter.  I buy several and leave them in coat pockets, my car and gym bag.  I would never go back to the sweet flavored chap-stick sold in the local drugstores when Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Lip Moisturizer is available through Amazon and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It is fabulous to use alone or under lipstick. It remains smooth as silk under it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  My lips went through an incredibly dry stage and this stuff was invaluable.  Nothing else worked, but this saved my sanity.  Keeping a tube for each pair of pants so I always have one on hand.</li>
    <li> Confession: I am a long-time devotee to Burts Beeswax Lip Balm (also available on Amazon). When my lips are really dry, though, I reach for this. It sticks around if I put it on at bedtime, so my lips don&#x27;t crack. I&#x27;ve never had a cold sore, but I sometimes will cut the corners of my mouth shaving; this keeps them from cracking, shortening healing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no flavor to speak of, and no tingle. It&#x27;s not as greasy as vaseline, not as waxy as most lip balms, and lasts for longer than any other I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> This is the best chap stick you will ever find!! I highly recommend it and will always keep using it!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm. Some lip balms cause my lips to peel (not sure why) but this one doesn&#x27;t and it feels really great on. Light and no taste.</li>
    <li> Higher priced than most in this category, but feels great going on and seems to work.  Nice product applicator here.</li>
    <li> Bought his lip moisturizer based on reviews.  I personally did not like anything about this lip moisturizer.  It has a silicone feel to it and had to reapply all day long.  I went though a whole tube in 1 week.  Gave the other one away.  I will go back to eos (http://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Mint-Organic-Balm-Sphere/dp/B003ND183O/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1364137223&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;eos+lip+balm) which is wax based lip balm but it does the job and love the sweet minty flavor and it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> After several love affairs with other well-known lip balms, I wanted something that was actually moisturizing my lips instead of making me feel like I needed to constantly re-apply.  This lip moisturizer is unscented, does not make your lips tingle, is long lasting, and is great on its own or under lipstick. My lips no longer crave lip balm, nor do they have dry spots or cracks.  This is now my go-to balm and I have to buy it in multiples to ensure I have them in my bag, in my car, at work, at my bedside, all over.</li>
    <li> This product offers no color, no scent, and no bad taste.  It is a no frills lip moisturizer which does exactly what it says it will do which is moisturize.  Excellent buy for the price.  I do agree with other reviews that the consistency is a bit soft so we will have to see how it holds when the Florida summer arrives.</li>
    <li> THE SHAPOO DOEWS THE TRICK.  THE CONDITIONER DOESN&#x27;T SPREAD OUT AND YOU NEED MUCH MORE CONDITION THAN SHAMPOO.  THE CHAP STICK IS TOO SOFT AND HOPELESS ON CHAPPED LIPS.  TOO EXPENSIVE.  TOO LITTLE POSITIVE EFFECT.  OTHER PRODUCTS WORK MUCH BETTER.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best chap stick I have used! It is more pasty than other, so it stays on longer and really penetrates. It isn&#x27;t easily linked off or removed by drinking. Compare g this to literally everything you can by in store this is the best.</li>
    <li> I find that SPF is a bit drying but I need it when I&#x27;m in the sun (my lips are very sensitive and burn easily). This is by far my favorite and I think I&#x27;ve tried every brand available.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years and keep one almost everywhere.  It is a very good product for moisturizing lips as well as using for a sunscreen.  Seems to stay on better than most.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands and have decided this one is my favorite. Neutrogena makes a great product and this one is no exception. It provides great protection and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Well made product&lt;br /&gt;Tube rotates near the top preventing it from turning in your pocket&lt;br /&gt;Good SPF protection&lt;br /&gt;No flavor&lt;br /&gt;Great for men and women&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;None that I can think of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;Look no further. This is the one!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. It moisturizes my lips for hours and hours.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for the perfect lip balm. One that will feel good going on, keep my lips moist and last a while. I decided to do something a little different, and recently ordered over 20 different lip balms. Some of these balms were listed in the top 10 by various different magazines, so I ordered due to reviews, so were ordered because of recommendations by friends or family. I rated them based on initial feel, staying power, smell, taste, packaging and ingredients. This one was a definite HIT! Smooth and creamy going on, no smell. no taste! Lasted for over an hour before the need to reapply... so I am going to give this a 4 star!</li>
    <li> Me and my friend like this Lip Balm a LOT! Very good thats its neutral flavor and scent, so anyone can use it. Keeps your lips hydrated and moisturized for hours without the need to reapply often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 years and it&#x27;s my ABSOLUTE favorite chapstick. It&#x27;s completely scentless, tasteless, and has SPF. It feels very nourishing and keeps my lips moisturized for a long time. What more could you want??</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding the right lip moisturizer/chap stick. I bought this item on an impulse because I needed a few more bucks for free shipping, so I decided to buy lip moisturizer. I was going to get Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I&#x27;m glad I found this one because it works really great. It actually leaves your lips feeling moisturized and NOT DRY like most other products (I have experienced) would. It&#x27;s also nice that there&#x27;s SPF 15. I don&#x27;t use this much, but I should since it works really well.</li>
    <li> I love this chapstick and I have tried many...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapstick brand is not very good because it doesn&#x27;t last and or keeps lips soft, Nivea is too wet and doesn&#x27;t stay on the lips, Rosebud salve is good when it&#x27;s on but leaves my lips very dries afterwards when it&#x27;s gone, Burts bees pomegranate was my favorite before using Neutrogena but since I found this chapstick I&#x27;ve been using it all the time because it&#x27;s better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After days of not using chapstick, my lips get very dry and chapped but then I put this on and after a few minutes my lips are soft again. It&#x27;s perfect in the summer and winter for cracked lips, I love it but I wish they have tinted versions of this, that would be a plus &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Not waxy, has lasting power and gives good shine. Been using only this for ten years! Need four more words.</li>
    <li> I have used the bee one and the only good thing is the smell, now this one does make your lips more soft but no smell, so I guess I rather to have my lips soft and looking healthy instead of just smelling good but no effect. so yes I recommend this lip balm.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, but I used it once to correct chapped lips, and it works quickly (and only one application). Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Works great and for the price a good buy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s better than reguralr Chaptstick, but it works as good as anything I have tried--moisturizing and protecting against the sun.</li>
    <li> Love it! This is, by far, one of the most moisturizing lip balms I&#x27;ve ever used. Has SPF as well!</li>
    <li> Really not that good and not that protective to lips</li>
    <li> got 12-11-2014 have a Merry Christmas</li>
    <li> Purchased on a whim since I saw good reviews. I don&#x27;t really think the staying power is that great so I only use it before bed (during the day I need some more heavy duty stuff since I&#x27;m talking, eating, wiping my mouth etc). In the morning, my lips aren&#x27;t particularly moisturized and I still have chapped lips (granted, I need to exfoliate them more than most people). I do like the design with the dial at the top though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is supposed to be scentless, so that means it smells kind of like lipstick or those organic &amp;#34;scentless&amp;#34; stuff that don&#x27;t smell that great. You can&#x27;t smell it too much once on though unless you are pursing your lips.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff because it is unscented without any flavor.  My 2-year old loves it and so do I.  It is also handy that it comes in a 2-pack.</li>
    <li> Best lip moisturizer I&#x27;ve found and it seems like I&#x27;m always trying some. Shouldn&#x27;t surprise me since I like their hand lotion too.</li>
    <li> good product and worth of every penny. small but wonderful item ideal as present for youny lady. my wife will definitely love it</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip moisturizer / chapstick, and I have tried many! Neutrogena, unaware to me until recently, has taken over all facial products of mine lately. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I love love love this lip moisturizer.  It goes on easily and lasts.  And it doesn&#x27;t smell!</li>
    <li> This lip balm has sunscreen but doesn&#x27;t sting or feel greasy.  My favorite one!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena products are always reliable for quality, in my opinion. I like the quality of the lip moisturized but did not care for the twisting open at the top of the tube rather than a the bottom. Lip balm is soft, smooth, not waxy and has a sunblock which is mandatory for me.&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend this product although frankly Blistik is just as good and a bit less expensive.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> my favorite chap stick ever! doesn&#x27;t feel slimey and oily after a while. doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell. never made me break out or anything. no complaints</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works for me--in both summer and winter. It keeps my lips smooth all year round. Unobtrusive scent and non-greasy. Great all around product.</li>
    <li> The wind dryer out my lips so bad and I&#x27;ve been trying to find a chapstick to moisturize my lips but nothing worked. This worked instantly. I found a winner!</li>
    <li> Great lip moisturizer. Pack of two is always handy.&lt;br /&gt;The formula stays on like forever scent and taste free which is great. Love wearing this under my lipstick it makes it last longer . There are times I&#x27;ve applied this to dry cuticles and its done the trick of maintaining my nails well till my nextmanicure</li>
    <li> I have eczema so I get really dry, cracked, bleeding lips during our cold Maryland winters.  This balm works great.  Only issue I have is a flavor, even mint, would be nice.</li>
    <li> one of the must have in my bag!!! already use this product everyday over 15 years, can&#x27;t go anywhere without it. They change the package look, but still same great quality!!!</li>
    <li> It felt a little waxy at first, but I had been using pure almond oil on my lips for a while. The almond oil seemed to dry out my lips a little using it on its own so I decided to try this chap stick. I got used to the feel and my lips are softer. It seems to seal in the moisture more than just the oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent product: fragrance-free and moisturizing....good to keep on hand at home and on the go. Neutrogena is a wonderful brand.</li>
    <li> Good standard lip balm with Spf.  Tough to find lip balm in this price point with spf.</li>
    <li> My kids love this stuff!  No smell....no sting!</li>
    <li> I just returned from a year-long trip that took me around the jungles and beaches of Papua New Guinea, and this product was part of my pack.  It didn&#x27;t do a great job of keeping my lips from getting sunburnt, and I ended up switching to another brand within a few weeks.  When applying, only a tiny amount actually makes it onto your lips as the substance stays quite hard and is flaky.  Not my favorite chapstick by a long shot.</li>
    <li> I *LOVE* this lip moisturizer.  Once upon a time (about 8 months ago and counting back), my bottom lip would dry and get a seemingly permanent vertical line right down the middle.  I&#x27;d tried other products, such as Chapstick (eew) and Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s (ok...) with, at the most, just satisfactory results.  I tried this product as it came with the Neutrogena sunblock I use and haven&#x27;t used anything else since.  It goes on smoothly, it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, I&#x27;ve never tasted it when licking my licks or when eating, and it does an amazing job at keeping my lips moisturized for hours.</li>
    <li> I love this lip stuff.  It is perfect for me.  I have a tube in every jacket pocket and on every surface at home and work.  I think it is addicting! It is  NOT waxy...soft on your lips and also not menthol-y...I also use it on cuticles in a pinch.  At the bus stop, I can whip it out and moisten cuticles and put mittens back on...</li>
    <li> I had heard great things about this but I didn&#x27;t have any luck with it. At first, it just didn&#x27;t moisturize. My lips would feel dry again within an hour of reapplying. After about a week, I realized it was actually drying out my lips. ( This only ever happened before with Burt&#x27;s bees so it&#x27;s probably not a sensitivity issue.) I then used Neosporin overnight lip treatment to restore my lips back to normal.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best chapstick on the market - i have tried sooo many different brands, and none of them compare to neutrogena. it leaves you lips CONDITIONED and soft, not waxy. other chapsticks just put a layer of moisture on top of your lips, whereas neutrogena actually penetrates the lips and improves the condition of the skin. i will never use another chapstick for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Just buy chapstick instead. seriously</li>
    <li> Confused as to why people are saying this is the best lip balm out there....&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t do as well as others I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan that it has absolutely no scent or taste, however.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s not that great. Yes it will work for 5 minutes and then you are back to applying it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;Next.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 15 years and I cannot use another brand.</li>
    <li> After having to take medication that dries out the&lt;br /&gt;skin, this is the only product I have found that&lt;br /&gt;helps to keep the lips moist for longer periods&lt;br /&gt;of time.</li>
    <li> If you have ever reached into your pocket for lip balm and removed the cap only to find the balm has been &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; into the length of the cap, then you are not alone. It has happened to me numerous times. What a mess! I end up losing balm and quickly throwing the mess away.&lt;br /&gt;I calm upon this product by accident. Just another purchase at the register at the pharmacy. The balm is good. The packaging is better. The wheel that advances the balm is just under the cover not at the opposite end where it can mysteriously advance on its own. It makes all the difference in the world. Lip balm manufacturers take note. All lip balms should be package this way!!</li>
    <li> did a real good job on my chapped lips.  Worked really well healing my lips in 2 days.. when i&#x27;ve had constant chapped lips my entire life</li>
    <li> I love the lip balm and the lotion</li>
    <li> The only balm that doesn&#x27;t seem to make your lips chapped if you stop using it. I have this on subscribe and save and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this product to be more moisturizing and hydrating. Seems like I have to apply and reapply quite often. I will stick to my Fresh brand lip treatment once this tube finishes.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend and it acutally reconditional my lip like never before.  The best one I ever had.  Blow all the ones I tried before away.</li>
    <li> Creamy formula glides on lips.  Non-irritating despite the fact it has a SPF 15; most sunscreens irritate my lips.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have a variety of chap sticks that are of the all-natural, organic, etc. variety and I like them, but this is my favorite mainstream gloss. It&#x27;s smooth and gentle with no taste.</li>
    <li> This lip balm leaves my lips very soft.  What I especially like about about it is that it has no taste or smell and is not &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;.  The sunscreen is an added plus.  I will definitely buy this lip moisturizer again and I am very happy to recommend it.</li>
    <li> Could not do without it during winter. I tried many other brands and this is far beyond comparison. Try it and you will love it (most certainy)</li>
    <li> The best lip balm, especially for cold winter wind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 4 or 5 lip balms and this is my favorite.  I have lips that seam dry 24/7 so use lip balm constantly.  I really like the feel and results of this product.</li>
    <li> it does the job.  my lips stay nice and soft during the winter... and during all the other seasons... I thought that i would only work in the winter, but alas it turns out it works year round!!!</li>
    <li> This is much better than other lip products I have used. I do not like perfumes and flavors and this product does not have that. It does take care of dry lips quickly. It is the only think I would use and lasts a while for me.</li>
    <li> For some reason, even though this product has nice reviews, this was the only lip balms out of the other ones I own that dried my lips the most. My lips were really chapped and this seemed to make it worse.</li>
    <li> I have the driest lips which chaps and bleeds very easily. I have tried umpteen lip moisturizers and this is the only one which has worked for me. It works for a long time after applying, not waxy and doesn&#x27;t have any taste to it. Its nice to have a 2 pack because i always prefer to have an extra one in the car. I have even started a subscription on this now because i couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else for this price.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Repaired my badly chapped lips in a about 3 days.</li>
    <li> I am using this lip moisturizer for a while now and i can feel the change, it makes my lip smooth and no more dry lips!!</li>
    <li> Just started using this for the first time.  Not sure how they&#x27;ll compare to Chapstick , but we&#x27;ll see</li>
    <li> Quality of the product is outstanding,  I would definitely recommend to everyone, product is AMAZING,  even recommended by my dermatologist!!!</li>
    <li> Active Ingredients: Octinoxate 7.5% and Oxybenzone 4%. Oxybenzone is not a natural ingredient. Best ingredients for sunscreen are Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip balm! I&#x27;ve been so disappointed that I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores. I&#x27;ve tried just about every product out there, and have tried several other products in the meantime (both traditional lip balms and all natural ones) and this is the best one. I have eczema, sensitive skin, acne, and all sorts of problems. I get eczema on my lips from time to time and this stuff helps a lot. I also love that it has sunscreen in it. Thank you, Amazon, for carrying it!</li>
    <li> Love it. Keep one in my purse, jacket, desk and car.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip balm, goes on smooth not waxy - feels moisturizing and lasts a good while before I feel I need to re-apply again.</li>
    <li> I have tried my share of lip balms and have a collection of half used sticks that I might as well just throw away since I now plan to only buy Neutrogena&#x27;s Norwegian Formula lip balm! It feels great when you put it on and the feeling lasts! I like to apply it before I work out and it lasts through a run or other activity where I will breathe through my mouth. Feels good to finally say good-bye to dry, flaky lips :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend the hand cream by Neutrogena&#x27;s Norwegian Formula.. it is a great line!</li>
    <li> I do like the construction of the adjustment ring at the top near the cap - I don&#x27;t have issues with it twisting up through the top of the cap when its in my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I agree with the no taste - but it is way way better than others I have tried.  Living in CO it seems like my lips are always chapped.  What I do like about this is something that I did not notice right away.  With other products I have to constantly use them to keep my lips from cracking.  With this product one application and I&#x27;m good to go for quite a while.  I no longer feel like I&#x27;m dependent on a lip balm.</li>
    <li> This is really great. This is immediate relief for when my lips are super chapped.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that even if I apply it in the morning it stays on for a really long time... it even stays on throughout my coffee sipping morning!</li>
    <li> One of the best lip moisturizer&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> Recently I got fed up with the feeling that I constantly needed to use chapstick. In the wintertime I keep one in every jacket I might wear, as well as at my desk at work and by my bedside. Then I read an article which explained how some ingredients in various lip moisturizer products might feel good temporarily, but are actually making it so you need *more* of the product as time passes. So I looked over the various ones I had from names like Chapstick, Blistex, and Lip Medex -- and threw away most of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took some digging to find options like this Neutrogena one that have all the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; ingredients (natural oils, sunscreen) and none of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; (camphor, phenol, menthol, salicylic acid).  It only took a few days for my lips to get over their addiction to the bad products and get used to the better ones. Now, instead of feeling like I need to apply lip moisturizer many times a day, I only need to every few days or so -- and we&#x27;re still in cold, windy winter weather here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees lip moisturizers are also a good alternative, but I settled on this one because it does not have any fancy &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; or smells -- it is just a simple &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell that is hardly noticeable. So far the Neutrogena ones have weathered well in my coat pockets, and continue to apply smoothly. (Some competitors&#x27; products have partly &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34;, which can be messy.)</li>
    <li> I adore this lip balm. Moisturizes thoroughly and stays on all night. Heals my dry lips quickly! It&#x27;s a very effective product.</li>
