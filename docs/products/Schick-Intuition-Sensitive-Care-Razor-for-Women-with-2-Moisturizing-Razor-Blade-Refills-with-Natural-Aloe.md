      <li>I love this razor!!  </li>
      <li>I love and the scent is great.</li>
      <li>I love the smell!</li>
      <li>It is smooth and smells great.</li>
      <li>I think I still could have gotten some use out of the razor if I had started using some of my own shaving cream until time to change heads.</li>
      <li>And, I am able to save money on shave cream because of the built in shave cream.  </li>
      <li>Have been using the intuition for about a year now and love it.</li>
      <li>The shave is closer and the cream bar more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Let me tell you that I&#x27;m in love with this one.  </li>
      <li>The Schick Intuition is amazing, with the moisture band all the way around the razor head, it makes for a smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this razor soap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the Venus razor with built in shaving gel, and the Schick Intuition is much better.</li>
      <li>I just love not haveing to use any shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>If I am in a hurry, I love this razor because it eliminates the time it takes to lather, then rinse.  </li>
      <li>I love these razors.  </li>
      <li>Regardless it makes shaving my legs take two minutes, which means I can afford to take the time to shave my legs more often.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I love the differnet scents you can get.  </li>
      <li>I love the Intuition razors.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, and it&#x27;s super convenient -</li>
      <li>is great and skin is soft afterwards.</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves my legs really soft.</li>
      <li>I read many reviews saying this is great first razor; I say this is also a great razor for the other ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would honestly like to shave more often, but lathering, attempting to keep it from washing off whilst contorting your body to bend and shave your legs in the shower is almost too much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quick, easy, and leaves my underarms very smooth.  </li>
      <li>First one of this kind I bought.</li>
      <li>I find it shaves smoothly and no knicks.</li>
      <li>Smooth.</li>
      <li>I used to always use the &amp;#34;venus&amp;#34; line of razors, but switched to one that is cruelty free.</li>
      <li>and it is very rare that I nick myself</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that the head does fall off if you happen to drop it, but I haven&#x27;t had a huge problem in that area.</li>
      <li>The strip on bottom gets used up pretty quickly, but there is a strip on top which you can also use to prime the area you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
      <li>Its quick Clean and one swipe its gone.</li>
      <li>(and I&#x27;m a fast leg shaver :))  </li>
      <li>so I am very leary about buying razors with more than 3 blades on them.</li>
      <li>This particular version is very silky and smells nice while you are using it.</li>
      <li>Since the first time I used this brand of razor I was hooked!  </li>
      <li>Leaves skin soft and moisturized plus it smells fantastic and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t give as clean a shave as other great razors; but it is much safer.  </li>
      <li>I have always had a problem with shaving, would get ingrown hairs, my legs would look like I had some rare dusease, so</li>
      <li>I wish I could get as smooth of a shave as with a normal razor, but that&#x27;s the drawback of the razor&#x27;s head being surrounded by the bulky cream bar.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this type of razor in the past and have always been happy with the results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real treat!</li>
      <li>I am pretty fond of this razor and the shaving bar attached to it.</li>
      <li>At first I got ingrown hairs</li>
      <li>The coconut refills leave my skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Really though is it worth it for one SHAVE?</li>
      <li>Read the reviews and bought this for the first time.</li>
      <li>I tend to nick myself a bit versus a good plain razor.</li>
      <li>I liked the built in bar, and hoped that would cut down on razor burn.</li>
      <li>Especially since the cream bar melts very quickly as others have mentioned.</li>
      <li>Very convenient.  </li>
      <li>Love it just as much as all of the other Intuition products.</li>
      <li>The soap probably runs out before the razor is dull; but I love this razor anyway!</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more of this one in the future.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for the intuition.</li>
      <li>I got this for a great price, but normally they are a bit expensive.</li>
      <li>My only warning is that they&#x27;re pretty sharp, which is a good thing for a razor, but be careful around the knees and Achilles tendon because I&#x27;ve nicked myself a couple of times.</li>
      <li>My legs have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Back when they first came out.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the Coconut Milk and Almond Oil razor, and I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not great - adequate for a quick shave, but nothing like a real razor.  </li>
      <li>I just bought my first refills for it, and I suspect I&#x27;ll be using it for a long time.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that when I placed the order and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Just lean over and run a few smooth strokes up your leg, rinse and done.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product with out a thought and it leave your legs extremly soft.</li>
      <li>would definitely recommend it is definitely worth the extra money</li>
      <li>The razor itself lasted a pretty long time!</li>
      <li>The only thing is it does not have the hole in the handle to hang it like the older ones.</li>
      <li>However, the bar around the razor melt pretty quickly under water and the razor is sometimes very difficult to clean.  </li>
      <li>My skin is so dry and this product really moisturized my skin.</li>
      <li>The blades dont swivel so it barely gets anything.</li>
      <li>It is so much easier than other ones I have tried.</li>
      <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as a naked razor with cream, but I&#x27;ve noticed I can do it more often without irritating my skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great razor for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to add shaving cream.  It is smooth and smells great.</li>
    <li> Alas it was 6 bucks ...Buying them anywhere else would have been robbery. Schick Came up with these a couple of years back .&lt;br /&gt;They were around 4 dollars. Their refills were always expensive in the 9-10 dollar range. Now of course. They want to charge you 5 dollars to just look at their package. Let alone a 30 dollar refill pack ..A razor is just a razor although this happens to be the best one for me. I like the soap on it. Its quick Clean and one swipe its gone. Really though is it worth it for one SHAVE? The soap dies BEFORE the blade which really sucks. Because you have a great blade but if you use it without the soap. You are risking Scratches  from the plastic underneath the soap. So basically ..You pay for a BAR of soap Slapped onto a 10 dollar razor . Back when they first came out. They lasted longer, They were cheaper. Now you have to wait until you get paid to shave. SUCKS!</li>
    <li> Since the first time I used this brand of razor I was hooked!  I just love not haveing to use any shaving cream.  They glide well and it is very rare that I nick myself (and I&#x27;m a fast leg shaver :))  I love the differnet scents you can get.  I hope they never quit making this razor!</li>
    <li> Great for travel! No need to pack bulky shaving lotions. However I use traditional shavers and lotion at home.</li>
    <li> Have been using the intuition for about a year now and love it. The coconut refills leave my skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I get terrible irritation when shaving my underarms, so this product is a godsend.  Quick, easy, and leaves my underarms very smooth.  No, it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as a naked razor with cream, but I&#x27;ve noticed I can do it more often without irritating my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried it on my legs and it&#x27;s not great - adequate for a quick shave, but nothing like a real razor.  It works well for bikini lines, but if you&#x27;re doing the whole thing down there, it might take forever since the hair gets trapped between the shaving blade and the solid.  You have to either submerge the thing or run water over it, which decreases the shaving creams solid a bit. Definitely great for maintenance though.  I&#x27;ve NEVER had razor burn with this product and I generally have it in the shower for my arm pits alone as I don&#x27;t need to shave my legs every single day during the colder months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is great and skin is soft afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is possibly the worst razor I have used. I used to always use the &amp;#34;venus&amp;#34; line of razors, but switched to one that is cruelty free. I had high hopes for the intuition. I liked the built in bar, and hoped that would cut down on razor burn. It did, but only because the blades dont touch your skin. Then the second time you try to use it, the bar will fall off. The blades dont swivel so it barely gets anything. Flimsy too, the head falls off all that time. I wont be buying another one.</li>
    <li> Convenient to use and smells great!</li>
    <li> My legs have very sensitive skin so I am very leary about buying razors with more than 3 blades on them. The Schick Intuition is amazing, with the moisture band all the way around the razor head, it makes for a smooth shave.  And, I am able to save money on shave cream because of the built in shave cream.  I won&#x27;t buy any other razor.</li>

    <li> This is a GREAT  razor. I find it shaves smoothly and no knicks. It is so much easier than other ones I have tried. A must buy!</li>
    <li> the only razor I use and I never cut myself would definitely recommend it is definitely worth the extra money</li>
    <li> Love this. It is a little pricey, but if you&#x27;re careful about how you rinse it, the soap lasts a decently long time. It smells nice, and it&#x27;s super convenient - however, it&#x27;s the soap/whatever it is that got me. My legs used to be so dry that I would scratch at them constantly -no shaving creams, lotions, or anything else seemed to help, and though shaving definitely made it worse, even not shaving for a while did not eliminate the problem.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the heck is in this soap did. I just bought my first refills for it, and I suspect I&#x27;ll be using it for a long time.</li>

I think I still could have gotten some use out of the razor if I had started using some of my own shaving cream until time to change heads.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use the Intuition regulary and when I saw there was a coconut milk &amp; almond oil, I had to have it. Love it just as much as all of the other Intuition products.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this razor soap. The only thing is it does not have the hole in the handle to hang it like the older ones. I would still order it again.</li>
    <li> There are 2 separate replacement blades included in this package. I didn&#x27;t realize that when I placed the order and was pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve used this type of razor in the past and have always been happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I love the Intuition razors. My only warning is that they&#x27;re pretty sharp, which is a good thing for a razor, but be careful around the knees and Achilles tendon because I&#x27;ve nicked myself a couple of times. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the Coconut Milk and Almond Oil razor, and I&#x27;m a big fan. It smells great and leaves my legs really soft.</li>
    <li> This is convenient because you don&#x27;t need soap or shaving cream.  However, the bar around the razor melt pretty quickly under water and the razor is sometimes very difficult to clean.  It also doesn&#x27;t give as clean a shave as other great razors; but it is much safer.  Less nicks &amp; cuts.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and bought this for the first time. My skin is so dry and this product really moisturized my skin. I&#x27;m still using the same razor after three weeks and I plan to continue using this product. I will be buying the refills. It&#x27;s a real treat!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever had. Leaves skin soft and moisturized plus it smells fantastic and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I get the appeal of a razor with lotion built into it.  However, I am not sure this is a razor I would want to use all the time for a close shave.  If I am in a hurry, I love this razor because it eliminates the time it takes to lather, then rinse.  If you don&#x27;t really care about random, stray hairs, and are always in a hurry, this is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> First one of this kind I bought. I love and the scent is great.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!!  I read many reviews saying this is great first razor; I say this is also a great razor for the other ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By time you&#x27;re in you 60&#x27;s shaving ones legs is hit and miss.  I would honestly like to shave more often, but lathering, attempting to keep it from washing off whilst contorting your body to bend and shave your legs in the shower is almost too much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a snap.  No double process. Just lean over and run a few smooth strokes up your leg, rinse and done.  In the two weeks I&#x27;ve had this razor I bet I&#x27;ve shaved every other day!  Smoothest my legs have been in years.</li>
    <li> Smooth. I love the smell!</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with shaving, would get ingrown hairs, my legs would look like I had some rare dusease, so I let them just grow because I was buying everything that came out in the market but nothing worked.  My sister introduced me to this product but the razor is a little ackward since I have little hands .  At first I got ingrown hairs but she told me to continue and I did.  Let me tell you that I&#x27;m in love with this one.  I recommend this product with out a thought and it leave your legs extremly soft.</li>
