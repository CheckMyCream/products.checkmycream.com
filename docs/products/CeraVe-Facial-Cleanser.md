<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not that impressed, and I think it&#x27;s overpriced. I also feel that it broke me out. It also has to be used several times to remove makeup.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best facial cleansers I have used. My skin has really improved since I started using it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. Not crazy about it  I&#x27;d rather use the Hydrating Cleanser... it&#x27;s makes skin feel like velvet.</li>
    <li> I love it! I use it to wash my face in the shower every day, and at night before bed.</li>
    <li> Best cleanser ever!!! Mild, but removes all my makeup. I have sensitive skin, so I am picky about my cleansers. And I also like to have a cleanser that does not require me to use an eye makeup remover. Great value, and you only need one pump for your whole face and neck.</li>
    <li> MY FACE IS HAPPY, SINCE MY SKIN IS SO SENSITIVE.</li>
    <li> Great product for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist. However, it is very drying and this stings my eyes more than any soap I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Having soy allergies has been challenge to find face products. CeraVe works. It was recommended to me by another allergy sufferer. I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> I like this for my sensitive skin. The only issue I have is it doesn&#x27;t help control the oil. I use this just before bed, and I wake up with oily skin the next morning. This is not something I have had trouble with before with other products. I do like how clean this product is though. Doesn&#x27;t have all that fragrance crap in it.</li>
    <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Everything else either dried out my skin or left it too greasy.  Note: if you have have combination skin, the Aveeno moisturizer for eczema works perfectly in conjunction with this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and was recommended by my dermatologist. I use it every day. Leaves my face clean and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I discovered the CeraVe line from my dermatologist.  She gave me samples of their day and night moisturizers - day has SPF30.  I like the moisturizers enough that I decided to try the facial cleanser.  I work outside gardening as much as possible, and have two horses which require daily chores.  As a result, my face is absolutely disgusting at the end of the day!  Even wearing light makeup over the moisturizers, the dust, dirt, and sweat makes my skin very, very dirty.  This inexpensive cleanser absolutely cuts through the dirt and makeup to reveal clean skin.  (They also have a cream based product.)  However, I do not use it to take off eye makeup.  My eyes require a sting-free makeup remover for my waterproof mascara.  For my eyes, I recommend the Lancome or even the Avon product also available here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial cleanser.  My teenagers use it and it clears up their acne without drying out their skin.  This is the best product I have found that actually works without drying out the skin.</li>
    <li> Love it great deal  thank you</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended CeraVe products for my skin and it&#x27;s my new creamy crack. My skin feels absolutely amazing after using the product.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by a friend who swears by the stuff. It is the first cleanser I&#x27;ve used in over a year that didn&#x27;t cause additional acne. Whew!</li>
    <li> Great face wash that makes your face feel clean &amp; fresh. I will be reordering when I run out. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great way to stock up on Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser.  Love the pump container, very clean and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product , delivery time good</li>
    <li> This face wash is wonderful.  I have lived and died by Philosophy products and decided it was time to change it up and get rid of a bit of hyper-pigmentation and chin acne.  This wash has gotten me there.  I have been using it for about two months now and there is a marked difference in the feel and appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I have normal/oily skin and this is the only face cleanser that has worked in keeping my face and neck blemish and acne free. Other cleansers are too harsh and encourage my sebaceous glands to produce excess oil, resulting in more acne. Worth every penny--will buy again!</li>
    <li> I get perioral dermatitis and this stuff is awesome!</li>
