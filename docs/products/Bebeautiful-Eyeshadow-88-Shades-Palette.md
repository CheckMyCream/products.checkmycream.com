      <li>This palette looks just like the product image and the eye shadows are easy to apply.</li>

      <li>This product was amazing and it got here really fast</li>

      <li>I also love that a few have shimmer</li>
      <li>Too many chemicals and heavy metals....</li>
      <li>Each color is about the size of a nickel but are about as deep as two nickels stacked on top of each other.</li>

      <li>I need it for an unexpected circumstance.</li>
      <li>and it came really early In the mail.</li>

<li> I just got this today and one of the blue eye shadows was broken but other than that I love it.</li>
<li> On average, day-to-day, I do not wear much eye-shadows, mainly because I am running late to work and rather sleep in a half hour longer than blend away at eye-shadows.</li>
<li> they are not very high quality pigmentation.</li>
<li> Good quality, very pigmented but arrived broken :(</li>
<li> A few shades had a small amount of shine to them, but it&#x27;s nothing to much.</li>
<li> /&gt;I am going to try using the shadows wet and experiment.</li>
<li> Colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as expected.</li>
<li> First one arrived with a few of the eye shadows broken and out of their place.  </li>
<li> OTHER</li>
<li> This palette offers a wide range of colors but it is so poorly pigmented.</li>
<li> Second, though I expected this, all the colors were very small.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll put a picture down to show the differences between a primer a non-primer street</li>
<li> One of the wells came damaged, so i lost half of that one color already.</li>
<li> I had read the reviews previously to purchasing, and decided to go for it.</li>
<li> besides the mess</li>
<li> Not all of the colors are matte, a few are slightly shimmery.</li>
<li> I wanted this palette to offer a little of what I was looking for without having to break the bank</li>
<li> Extremelly poor quality, came as if it had been dropped, even the internal mirror was lose.</li>
<li> Several of the powder eye shadows arrived broken.</li>
<li> (practice for a costume) along with a few swatches.</li>
<li> Was so bummed to see what a waste of money this pallet was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I was really disappointed they had very pretty colors.</li>
<li> Requested replacement and the second one arrived worst than the first.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The Item is great, colors look great and was a bargain. When I opened the item, the mirror wasn&#x27;t attached, and one of the colors was all broken.  I had read the reviews previously to purchasing, and decided to go for it. Not a bad buy.</li>
    <li> On average, day-to-day, I do not wear much eye-shadows, mainly because I am running late to work and rather sleep in a half hour longer than blend away at eye-shadows. However, on occasion and on weekends, I have more time and enjoy creating a look with some color on my lids. This palette offers a wide range of colors but it is so poorly pigmented. I wanted this palette to offer a little of what I was looking for without having to break the bank but it has failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try using the shadows wet and experiment.</li>
    <li> Soooooo many colors&lt;br /&gt;And they apply correctly</li>
    <li> Good quality, very pigmented but arrived broken :(</li>
    <li> Too many chemicals and heavy metals.... Ugh. But tout get what you pay for. I note use 100% pure make up which is all good grade, mostly organic, vegetarian, and made from real ingredients abd works amazingly!</li>
    <li> Terrible everything was messy.&lt;br /&gt;But besides the mess it&#x27;s really cute</li>
    <li> Was so bummed to see what a waste of money this pallet was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off when I took it out of the package the mirror had broken off its base and two colors were shattered. Second, though I expected this, all the colors were very small. Each one is probably about the size of a penny. Next is the product itself. You will definitely need a primer if you want to use this eyeshadow. If not it is virtually invisible. I&#x27;ll put a picture down to show the differences between a primer a non-primer street so you can really see what it looks like. Last it says that this pallet is all Matt but really it is very glittery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here I have included pictures of the damaged that occurred during shipping and the make up product on my eye (practice for a costume) along with a few swatches.</li>
    <li> These eye shadows show up great and the color selection is amazing. Every shade of every color imaginable. The reason for the 3 stars is because the case is cheaply made and the mirror came unglued, fell off and broke after using it just a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much. Wonderful colors.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT THE ONLY THING I DIDNT LIKE IS WHEN ARRIVED SOME OF THE COLORS WERE CRACKED ... MAYBE NEEDS TO BE WRAPPED ALITTLE BETTER...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT OTHER THEN THAT I LOVE IT ....</li>
    <li> they are ok, just that one of the shadows was shatterd when it arrived.</li>
    <li> The colors on this palette are vibrant and pretty pigmented . I have used them several times and the colors don&#x27;t smudge or crease( keep in mind your eyelids should be preped with an eye primer for greater results) Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product , the mirror was unattached when I opend the case but a few drops of super glue fix that .</li>
    <li> 2 star for this product 1 star for its quickly delivered</li>
    <li> This product was amazing and it got here really fast</li>
    <li> Extremelly poor quality, came as if it had been dropped, even the internal mirror was lose.</li>
    <li> I would rate this item a five, but two eyeshadows broke away from the case during shipment. I have tested the eyeshadow and they are very well pigmented. They are smooth to apply and last ALL day. I love them.</li>
    <li> Produce just arrived. The darker colors have more pigment than the lighter colors. The lighter colors will require a second pass/pat if you want a bolder look.&lt;br /&gt;Only one color had a small break in it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even get to try it. First one arrived with a few of the eye shadows broken and out of their place.  Requested replacement and the second one arrived worst than the first.  Eye shadow powder all over the package.  I was really disappointed they had very pretty colors.</li>
    <li> I just got this today and one of the blue eye shadows was broken but other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> This product came in a firm box and has a beautiful pallet. The colors are bright and apply easy ( with primer of course ). None of the colors came broken and the mirror was in-tacked. Colors are matte except for a couple. Each color is about the size of a nickel but are about as deep as two nickels stacked on top of each other. I would buy this product again and again!</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend at the same time I got her the warm set she like&#x27;s this set but say&#x27;s she like&#x27;s the warm better . It&#x27;s a nice kit and work&#x27;s nice .</li>
    <li> I love this the colors stay on really well and it came really early In the mail. The colors are very vibrant and pretty I really hope you get this product</li>
    <li> good value, lots of colors to choose from and I&#x27;m happy that I bought it....even the case is nice....I&#x27;m happy that I bought this...</li>
    <li> The mirror was detached and one of the eyeshadow was broken.</li>
    <li> Amazing colors! This palette looks just like the product image and the eye shadows are easy to apply. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Literally just opened this, one of the shades of green was broken and smeared around it. Tried to color match all of them, they seem to be pigmented. Help with eye shadow primer, it&#x27;ll be even better.</li>
    <li> These were crazy pigmented and came quick! :)</li>
    <li> Mirror came unglued. Colours doesn&#x27;t show bright on darker skin tones.</li>
    <li> Love the bright colors didn&#x27;t take long to get but some of them were broken and just about gone also was very messy powder was everywhere</li>
    <li> Thank you for my shipment but 3 of the eyeshadows are broken and and the mirror is off. When I open the box my clothes got dirty from the broken eyeshadow</li>
    <li> I love the colors and eye shadow. Only disappointment was that when i received the palette, a couple of the colors were broken up and I cannot use them.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product. The package came wrapped well and the eyeshadows were intact. The colors are nice and vibrant (the darker colors more pigmented than the lighter, but I do not find the lighter colors un-pigmented, or the darker colors too pigmented). The colors really come through and are mostly distinct. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the size of the eyeshadows when I  bought this product,  so to give some perspective, the eyeshadows are about the size of a dime.</li>
    <li> I received this with broken shadows ,Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Not very pigmented :(</li>
    <li> I have bought cheaper makeup better than this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great value for the price, less expensive than a single brand name eye shadow. What is really nice about this is that it can used for everyday makeup but also for special occasions and when you want to mix it up a bit. By no means is this MAC quality but 88 shades for $10 is a steal. Great gift item too.</li>
    <li> Came very quickly with all of the shadows intact.  Shadow pans are very small, but I believe that is stated in the description.  Color pay off is not bad and it&#x27;s exciting that there are so many colors to choose from.  I will probably put this in my kit in case I need it for an unexpected circumstance.</li>
    <li> Loved the colors the only problem was about 5 palettes were cracked when I got it</li>
    <li> I like this product the dark colors show up really nice on chocolate skin tones!</li>
    <li> one of my shadows was broken</li>
    <li> Several of the powder eye shadows arrived broken. The mirror also wasn&#x27;t attached to the top cover. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the colors. It&#x27;s not a quality product.</li>
    <li> I love it but I&#x27;m disappointed b.c one of the colors &amp; mirror fell out &amp; the thing was a bit dusty from the makeup itself. Other than that the pallet looks nice &amp; the colors are great as well in terms of use.</li>
    <li> Colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as expected. One of the wells came damaged, so i lost half of that one color already. Very inexpensive for a pallet with so many different colors. Not all of the colors are matte, a few are slightly shimmery. The wells are each about the size of a dime. Good, inexpensive pallet for someone who wants to just dabble in trying more colorful eye makeup. I am going to try applying some white cream or primer underneath the colors to see if that helps with the vibrancy and evenness of pigment. Pallet comes with two standard double-tipped eye shadow applicators.</li>
    <li> they are not very high quality pigmentation.</li>
    <li> It seems as if the sponges that come with the product absorb the color and you&#x27;re constantly having to re-apply to the sponge.  Does not go on easy.</li>
    <li> this deserves 0 stars.  it&#x27;s very cheap  the colors look white when you apply them.</li>
    <li> not that pigmented some colors arrived broken</li>
    <li> Amazing!! So satisfied with this order. Came on time and was nicely packaged, nothing was broken and the colors are beautiful. Couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the colors! I also love that a few have shimmer but there are still a tone of matte colors. Finding matte eyeshadow is reall difficult! This palette is amazing. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> A few shades had a small amount of shine to them, but it&#x27;s nothing to much. When I received the package the mirror did fall out of its spot but was still intact ,nothing glue wont fix. Overall the packaging was nice and it came very quickly. I will be buying more in the future.</li>
