      <li>The fact that it smells like grape juice is an added bonus:)</li>
      <li>Im confident because i leave it at home</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>really love this lip tint</li>
      <li>#34;Vampire Red&amp;#34; lasts more since the color stains and lasts waaaay longer than the more lighter shades</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite type of lip color since it doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many a lip tint before, and they tend to fade quite a lot during the day.</li>
      <li>I recommend it :-)</li>
      <li>TonyMoly is a better stain than this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot more liquid-y in consistency</li>
      <li>I think this shade would look better on someone with a cooler skin tone.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good and also tastes pretty yummy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a jelly-like consistency rather than watery, so I feel more comfortable having it in my purse.</li>
      <li>Is a dark stain- more bloody-color than cherry but not purple at all is the best way to describe the color.</li>
      <li>This lip tint is amazing, great color and lasts long even through eating and drinking.</li>
      <li>so pretty and really effective :)</li>
      <li>The color is great, but make sure you do multiple layers in order to get a nice, colorful coat.</li>
      <li>It comes off way to easy</li>
      <li>That being said, it is cheaper than most drugstore lip products in the US and far superior to any stains I&#x27;ve used here.</li>
      <li>Looks gorgeous on olive skin tones especially, but all warm skin tones.</li>
      <li>love Etude House&#x27;s lip tints because their lip tints is basically the only thing I can afford from them honestly, but the color payouts are always nice</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this.</li>
      <li>This is nice wine color, more plum then red on me.</li>
      <li>Great color that has real pop, especially if you&#x27;re going easy on the eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>and I love them so much I finished a tube of &amp;#34;Berry Red&amp;#34; within a week once,</li>
      <li>I love the shape and angle of the applicator but the hole in it grabs too much product.</li>
      <li>I think this would look better on a darker or much lighter complexion than mine -</li>
      <li>Also had an intriguing scent to it, can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is definitely a fun tint to use.</li>
      <li>and i really love the freebies and especially the lip tint!</li>
      <li>Close enough to benetint- and way better at 5bux that 30 or 40.</li>
      <li>The picture is exactly what the product looks like, and it came with a safety seal as well.</li>
      <li>Was packaged nice in bubble wrap, small sturdy box and included some free samples.</li>
      <li>This is such a lovely lip stain.</li>
      <li>first drop of this on my lips, and</li>
      <li>I give this a 4/5 because although it smells like heavenly jam and the color is beautiful and lasts pretty well, the tangy bitter taste is rather gross</li>
      <li>PERFECT for my skintone (pale and pink, hahaha).</li>
      <li>fast shipping</li>
      <li>Looks very blotchy.  </li>
      <li>The sample included Panda &#x27; s Dream Eye Patch, Tony Moly Intense Care Dual Effect Sleeping Pack and Skin Food Broccoli Toner.</li>
      <li>not taste like cherries, don&#x27;t accidentally lick your lips with this on, haha.)</li>
      <li>( it did come fast</li>
      <li>and it seems like I have to apply way too much for it to even show on my lips,</li>
      <li>More watery than I had expected</li>
      <li>The tint itself is nice and lasts a few hours and fades gracefully.</li>
      <li>and the color is very deep and rich.</li>
      <li>Great, long-lasting color with a pretty silly grape tylenol flavor/smell.</li>
      <li>As a daily routine, I would apply the lip stain &amp; my lip balm in the morning and walk right out the door!</li>
      <li>You can easily build up the colors or do a gradient lip with this, once it&#x27;s dry, it won&#x27;t budge!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty natural looking.</li>
      <li>and I have really light pink lips.....</li>
      <li>If you lick your lips once it&#x27;s dried though, it&#x27;s a bit better.</li>
      <li>The flavor is ridiculous, but I like it, to be honest.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine it looking very natural on cooler skin though.</li>
      <li>Also try to have your lips as dry as possible, even if you wet your lips with your own saliva</li>
      <li>The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about the product is the taste.</li>
      <li>Super pigmented for my super pale lips ( and dry ).</li>
      <li>the look that many girls try to achieve for the small pouty lip look!</li>
      <li>The color does stay on pretty well, but if you happen to get some in your mouth, it taste is kinda bitter.</li>
      <li>Lasts a few hours, but if you want the full color, should reapply every 1.5-2 hours.</li>
      <li>and it takes a few coats to achieve the color I want, though not a bad product.</li>
      <li>but this is a little thicker an requires only one pass to get a nice dark color.</li>
      <li>a pretty, bloody red, i love it a lot !!</li>
      <li>It dries pretty fast so its hard to blend out.</li>
      <li>First of all, the burgundy/dark cherry color goes so well with my dark skin</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I give this a 4/5 because although it smells like heavenly jam and the color is beautiful and lasts pretty well, the tangy bitter taste is rather gross and I find myself constantly wiping the wand. I love the shape and angle of the applicator but the hole in it grabs too much product. That being said, it is cheaper than most drugstore lip products in the US and far superior to any stains I&#x27;ve used here.</li>
    <li> Horrible color. Does not even apply well. Looks very blotchy.  It was delivered in a timely matter and packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected. The color just stays on for less than 2 hours. Just what I like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several stains for both cheek and lip color. It&#x27;s my favorite type of lip color since it doesn&#x27;t rub off. Most stains are thin, liquids but this is a little thicker an requires only one pass to get a nice dark color. It has a fruity scent and a slightly fruity flavor(I accidentally licked it before it dried though you shouldn&#x27;t do this). I&#x27;m shocked to find that it surpasses stains that I&#x27;ve paid over $20 for.</li>
    <li> Great color that has real pop, especially if you&#x27;re going easy on the eye makeup.  Lasts a few hours, but if you want the full color, should reapply every 1.5-2 hours.</li>
    <li> Great, long-lasting color with a pretty silly grape tylenol flavor/smell. Love this stuff. It lasts forever and looks really nice. The flavor is ridiculous, but I like it, to be honest. Great lip stain, and a much better price point than anything from Sephora. It&#x27;s also a jelly-like consistency rather than watery, so I feel more comfortable having it in my purse.</li>
    <li> This is awesome. So awesome. I&#x27;ve tried many a lip tint before, and they tend to fade quite a lot during the day. Wore this out for a few hours and it stayed really well! It&#x27;s a lot more liquid-y in consistency than I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s really awesome and the color is very deep and rich. It also smells like cherries so, bonus :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Does not taste like cherries, don&#x27;t accidentally lick your lips with this on, haha.)</li>
    <li> underwhelmed would describe how I feel about this product. It comes off way to easy and it seems like I have to apply way too much for it to even show on my lips, and I have really light pink lips.....</li>
    <li> Close enough to benetint- and way better at 5bux that 30 or 40. Is a dark stain- more bloody-color than cherry but not purple at all is the best way to describe the color. Once it dries it does lighten a bit but not much. The stain work great and I hope to buy another, same color.</li>
    <li> I am impressed by this product. I bought this and another Etude lip tint, and I definitely would purchase these tints again. They have great color pay off, smelldelicious, and give you either a full lip look or (if applied correctly) the look that many girls try to achieve for the small pouty lip look! So impressed</li>
    <li> This is such a lovely lip stain. It smells like berries and looks like dark, red berries too. Applying is kind of annoying. It dries pretty fast so its hard to blend out. It lasts for a long time though. I recommend it :-)</li>
    <li> It is a little difficult to remove. But I like the color.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this. But I was disappointed when I got it. The color is great! Well, until it all ends up in the middle(where your lips touch). I would not order this again.</li>
    <li> I thought this was gonna stay on my lips and not just on the inner corner of my mouth. I was pumped to get this because i saw that other girls were getting samples with this purchase but i didn&#x27;t get any samples:( it did come fast but overall i wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this lip tint. Its pigmented but it only stays in the inner corners of you lips. And the rest fades which makes it look very splotchy and weird not cute. Smells like Tylenol and has bad chemicals that shouldn&#x27;t be in lip stains</li>
    <li> Vampire Red is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first drop of this on my lips, and I thought it looked like blood. And after messing it up the second time, it looked like I had just got done sucking someone&#x27;s blood. The color does stay on pretty well, but if you happen to get some in your mouth, it taste is kinda bitter. Also had an intriguing scent to it, can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it. Cherry, I suppose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a fun tint to use. The picture is exactly what the product looks like, and it came with a safety seal as well. My seller was Fromwonderland.</li>
    <li> I placed my order on March 15 and I got my order on April 7 from BeautyNetKorea ( For $4.95 ). The reason why the order took so long was because it&#x27;s sent from South Korea ( Btw, I live in the east coast of the United State ). It came in a cardboard box with the package wrapped in bubble wraps and 3 samples. The sample included Panda &#x27; s Dream Eye Patch, Tony Moly Intense Care Dual Effect Sleeping Pack and Skin Food Broccoli Toner. You can see a few scratches on the bottle under flash but very unnoticeable with the bare eye. The lip product it self was amazing! Super pigmented for my super pale lips ( and dry ). As a daily routine, I would apply the lip stain &amp; my lip balm in the morning and walk right out the door! You can easily build up the colors or do a gradient lip with this, once it&#x27;s dry, it won&#x27;t budge! (It has a grape smell)</li>
    <li> Sexy color and great staying power perfect for gradient lips.</li>
    <li> a pretty, bloody red, i love it a lot !!</li>
    <li> Omg love love !! Just what i wanted and the item arrive faster than i thought it would ! Satisfied!  :)</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s pretty natural looking. I like it because it&#x27;s like a reddish version of my own lip color. It wears for a good five hours but may need to be reapplied after eating.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! Thank you very much!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent choice! Loveit</li>
    <li> This is nice wine color, more plum then red on me. It is best to use this on well hydrated lips, if you are chapped it may not apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use it as a base for a gloss. To me this smelled grape-ish but it did not linger. The shipping was faster then expected. I am looking forward to trying other products from this company.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, I like how it gives a suddle POp of color ! * came with little •try me• packets !*</li>
    <li> I received this a month earlier that I was supposed to so didn&#x27;t have to wait too long it only took 2 weeks. I got it yesterday and tested it today the tint for me lasted 9 hours and it doesn&#x27;t transfer the color stayed perfect it smells amazing but it does taste a little bitter. In the box I received 2 samples a black snail cream and a grape toner stilk haven&#x27;t tried them yet but will later. If anything the only thing is that to get the dark color I would have to apply at least 3 layers but I definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and i really love the freebies and especially the lip tint! hope to have more transaction with you! 💕</li>
    <li> TonyMoly is a better stain than this. This stain will not stay on the lips very long and is not very pigmented. Would not order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten the &amp;#34;Berry Red&amp;#34; from the same lip tint line and if you&#x27;re having trouble getting the tint to blend out, I suggest blending &amp;#34;Vampire Red&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Berry Red&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Very Red&amp;#34; on your lips!&lt;br /&gt;I love Etude House&#x27;s lip tints because their lip tints is basically the only thing I can afford from them honestly, but the color payouts are always nice and I love them so much I finished a tube of &amp;#34;Berry Red&amp;#34; within a week once, but I feel like &amp;#34;Vampire Red&amp;#34; lasts more since the color stains and lasts waaaay longer than the more lighter shades they have.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this lip tint, I suggest you get it, and get either &amp;#34;Berry Red&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Very Red&amp;#34;. (or treat yo self and get all three colors)</li>
    <li> PERFECT for my skintone (pale and pink, hahaha). The product looks black, but once you apply it, it&#x27;s pretty red, a deep dark red.</li>
    <li> Best stain I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Its a great color, exactly what i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;The constancy of the tint is rather thick and I was expecting it to be watery. It doesn&#x27;t bother me but it did surprise me.&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good and also tastes pretty yummy (if you accidentally lick your lips a lot like me).&lt;br /&gt;It stays on all day for me without needing me to reapply it. Im confident because i leave it at home and i don&#x27;t feel the need to bring it with me when i go out because its THAT good.</li>
    <li> I love how nicely packaged it was when it was delivered (also came with samples). The tint itself is nice and lasts a few hours and fades gracefully. The shade Vampire Red may seem very dark at first but it is the same color that you see in the pictures when you apply it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a blood stain look, this is the product to go!  Looks gorgeous on olive skin tones especially, but all warm skin tones. I can&#x27;t imagine it looking very natural on cooler skin though.</li>
    <li> More watery than I had expected and it takes a few coats to achieve the color I want, though not a bad product. Then again, I&#x27;m Etude House biased so take it with a grain of salt!</li>
    <li> awesome lip stain!! so pretty and really effective :)</li>
    <li> The color is great, but make sure you do multiple layers in order to get a nice, colorful coat. Also try to have your lips as dry as possible, even if you wet your lips with your own saliva you&#x27;ll have to re-apply it until it&#x27;s completely dry. The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about the product is the taste. I can&#x27;t even describe it. If you lick your lips once it&#x27;s dried though, it&#x27;s a bit better.</li>
    <li> I love the color!!! It looks very good~</li>
    <li> This lip tint is amazing, great color and lasts long even through eating and drinking. The fact that it smells like grape juice is an added bonus:) It arrived in about a 3 weeks which isn&#x27;t bad considering it came from South Korea. Was packaged nice in bubble wrap, small sturdy box and included some free samples. Will buy again, very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> First of all, the burgundy/dark cherry color goes so well with my dark skin and I love it. It lasts long, and leaves my lips matt and soft. I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Give my lip little bump n dryness</li>
    <li> It works well and is long lasting. The shade does not flatter me, this is not the fault of the product, rather my fault for making a bad choice in color. I think this would look better on a darker or much lighter complexion than mine - I&#x27;m a fair/medium skin color with gold undertones. I think this shade would look better on someone with a cooler skin tone.</li>
