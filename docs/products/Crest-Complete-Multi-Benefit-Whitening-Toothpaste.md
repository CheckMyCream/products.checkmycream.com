<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only tooth paste my husband will use because he has senative gums and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t irritate them. I like it because it makes my mouth feel fresh for a long time. I do keep an eye on the price because sometimes I can find better prices at my local stores.</li>
    <li> SO CONVIENT TO HAVE THIS ITEM DELIVERED RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> My favorite kind of toothpaste. This is the only toothpaste that makes my teeth feel clean after I brush them. I go through this fast, so subscribe and save is a big convenience for me!</li>
    <li> I like this because it has a screw top. I hate the flip tops because they are messy. The toothpaste does the job also.</li>
    <li> This is most definitely toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Do you even know what you&#x27;re putting in your mouth? Check the United States Pharmacopeia website [...] to learn more about these ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetylpyridinium Chloride - USP defines as \\&quot;Toxic irritant\\&quot; [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benzoic Acid - USP says Harmful if swallowed, causes SERIOUS skin and eye irritation, and may cause respiratory irritation [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate - This is an irritant and prolonged exposure can have \\&quot;Possible hypersensitization and skin effects\\&quot; per the MSDS [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium saccharin - Per MSDS \\&quot;induced dominant lethality in 3 or 7 studies in mice in vivo\\&quot; [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Benzoate - USP MSDS \\&quot;WARNING Causes serious eye irritation\\&quot;  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate 80 - \\&quot;Irritation of eyes and mucous membranes\\&quot; [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat: certainly some of the studies are looking at higher levels of exposure, but consider the LONG-Term and 2-3x per day daily exposure of such chemicals. It may not be a large dose but it&#x27;s the prolonged exposure that is worrisome. Why chance increasing your chances of something like Cancer, Alzheimers, or Autism for your children if you can just avoid this and use something else just as effective. I&#x27;d rather not have to pay for your health bills.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried arm and hammer, I&#x27;ve tried colgate, I&#x27;ve tried various hotel toothpastes, nothing tastes less like soap and defeat than Crest for me.  Forget all the ads, all the studies, all the dentist recommended.  Find a toothpaste that you actually like using, and brush twice a day.</li>
    <li> this will dry all the skin on your mouth.</li>
    <li> The Shipping was fast, but I rather the other brand. I usually buy other brand, but I bought it because I had a coupon. My husband didn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
    <li> Thank You!!!  Everything was great....exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Contains little plastic balls that do nothing but get stuck in your gums and pollute water.</li>
    <li> First sonic toothbrush and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth paste. My teeth feel clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This minty fresh paste is the bombshizzle! It like exploded in my mouth with it&#x27;s freshness.  I can go for hours feeling all sleek and clean!!!</li>
    <li> Our favorite toothpaste!</li>
    <li> This is a good toothpaste for fighting cavities and whitening teeth. It tastes good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint about this toothpaste is that it gunks up my tooth brush. Even if I spend a few minutes rinsing out my toothbrush, there&#x27;s a layer of toothpaste at the bottom of the bristles. It is especially annoying with my electric toothbrush, since the tooth paste sticks to the inside of the brush part.</li>
    <li> I misinterpreted the description and thought that it was a twin-pack of 11.6 oz tubes.  It&#x27;s really 2 5.8 oz. tubes.  It&#x27;s too much of a pain to return, so I&#x27;ll keep it but I will NOT be purchasing toothpaste online again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the Crest goes, this is my absolute favorite toothpaste.  I prefer it above all others, the product is great!  I&#x27;ll just be purchasing it locally instead of here, it&#x27;s a better deal.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is very minty. It slays even MY morning breath. Haha. Jokes aside though, it is very good toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Colgate maxfresh is a little better. It keeps the breath fresher for longer.&lt;br /&gt;This is still a very good product.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.  The 2 pack means i don&#x27;t have to buy it as often which is great.</li>
    <li> Feeling clean and fresh.I like this stuff.</li>
    <li> Crest probably makes 50 different types of toothpastes and probably all advertise freshness !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used this at my brother&#x27;s place. Loved it and now these are on subscribe and save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint flavor / freshness stays after a meal (breskfast) -- which I think is a tall order and this one has achieved it.</li>
    <li> And amazon had the best price too, especially with the subscribe and save discount.  My kids don&#x27;t even like the kids crest flavor, they were always using our &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; crest toothpaste, so now I&#x27;m just buying this.</li>
    <li> I dunno, what can I say? It&#x27;s a toothpaste. It kept my breath smelling fresh and it cleaned my teeth. I always buy Crest.  I trust the brand and I like the flavors they make.</li>
    <li> crest tooth past what can you say</li>
    <li> My breath is now 10x fresher. Taste great! Brighter smile! With the added&lt;br /&gt;Benefit of scope! Might be cheaper at Walmart though!</li>
    <li> ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT... IT CAME AS I SPECTED… I RECOMMENDED… WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE AT ALL; QUALITY 95%...</li>
    <li> I love the minty fresh breath feeling that lingers for hours after I brush with this toothpaste, but that even takes a backseat to how much improved my gum health is after using it for 6 months.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Would recommend to others and love the convenience of Amazon. It&#x27;s my go-to toothpaste, lasts for a few hours. doesn&#x27;t feel paste-y.</li>
    <li> good value. cleans teeth the best I can tell.</li>
    <li> It has too many adjectives to live up -- tends to be chemical-tasting for me. Might kill friendly bacteria.</li>
    <li> I used to love this toothpaste :( Crest puts tiny mircorbeads inside this particular brand. I got blue little pieces of plastic inside of my teeth now because of it. I didn&#x27;t notice but my dentist sure did and I am guessing the ocean does as well.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is not too abrasive and has just the the right amount of mint Scope to leave your mouth refreshed without being overwhelming.</li>
    <li> it is what the dentist recommends and Amazon just makes it uber easy.  Love Subscribe and Save, not much more to say</li>
    <li> So don&#x27;t usually review stuff, but i made an exception for this putrid toothpaste. Often times I buy more expensive toothpaste because I prefer the after taste and don&#x27;t like to use fluoride, but this time my grocery store ran out of the kind i usually get so I bought this. I used this toothpaste twice a day with flossing everyday and mouthwash on occasion for about five or six weeks and everything was fine until the fifth week, at this time my gums became all swollen. So thinking it was something I ate I decided to wait a few days. By this time, the swelling increased, I experienced immense amounts whenever I flossed, and the muscles in between my jaw and neck hurt like hell. I realized it was this toothpaste and immediately threw it away. I hope this little excursion hasn&#x27;t jeopardized my health in the long run.</li>
    <li> While I did initially like this product I did came across some research showing that the tiny beads in this are actually plastic.  And that when we spit it out into the sink the beads are getting into our water supply and causing harm to the environment and fish.  To me the beads aren&#x27;t worth it.  They don&#x27;t seem to add much to the paste so I will buy something else.</li>
    <li> This deletes the need for mouthwash.  2 in 1 is always a great deal.  I saw whitening of my teeth the first week.  Never will stop using it, it&#x27;s in my subscribe &amp; save now.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste with a hint of Scope.  I&#x27;ll never go back to boring old toothpaste again!</li>
    <li> Good flavor and cleans real well.</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Great quality. When it comes to amazon and saving money this is the place to do it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Very good toothpaste. Leaves my mouth really fresh!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this one before and gave it a try. I was shocked to feel the burn of mouthwash in the toothpaste. I just figured it would leave the good breathe and normal mouthwash taste in my mouth, not the burn that goes with mouthwash. I&#x27;m glad though because I feel like its more &amp;#34;trustworthy&amp;#34; because it acts more like mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste but I think that the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; crest or colgate for $1 works just as well and leaves breath just as fresh.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand a very long time.  I like it.  It does tend to leave a residue due to the active ingredients in the product so don&#x27;t be alarmed.</li>
    <li> I love my toothpaste!! I like it even more when it shows up at my door from a 2 pack add on item!!</li>
    <li> This tube was received in great condition and in great shape.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> IT CHANGED FROM A TOOTH PASTE TO A GEL YUK!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite-flavored toothpaste...minty ribbon with Scope. Have used it for years. The paste received previously on subscription appeared to be counterfeit from both container construction and printing, and quality of the contents. The manufacturer agreed so residuals were sent back. This order appears genuine so I am inclined to keep this new subscription.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the cinnamon flavored toothpaste my wife uses. This is better for me. Clean and fresh, Ahhh, I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is a great combination of cleaning, breath freshening, and tooth whitening. Great taste!  It keeps my breath fresh for hours!</li>
    <li> I bought this type of Crest for the first time.  I like the flavor and the way it brushes my teeth.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Minty fresh and delivered to my door. You can&#x27;t really ask more in a toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My family&#x27;s been using it for a lot of years now! We used Crest anyway, and my husband used Scope. And when the two became one, it was a match made in Heaven &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Leaves mouth feeling fresh and clean.  Certainly seems to feel like my mouth stays fresher, longer with the scope addition to this toothpaste, but I&#x27;m not always the most patient when it comes to waiting to eat or drink after brushing in the morning.</li>
    <li> Very fresh feeling mouth. You feel like your mouth is clean.</li>
    <li> I only bought this toothpaste because we could get it through subscribe and save.  It does an adequate job at cleaning my teeth but I don&#x27;t feel like it leave my mouth or breath particularly fresh even immediately after brushing.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste as it gives you a strong minty flavor.  I find it very refreshing.  The only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t have any tartar or plaque killing elements.  So I use it at night, and use a plaque fighting toothpaste from Colgate in the morning.  I tried using this in the morning, but the mint taste is so strong that it started to interfere with my breakfast.</li>
    <li> clean with a classic flavor, what more can one ask for? also doesnt leave mouth feeling &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; like some toothpastes do, but still freshens breath and cleans teeth.</li>
    <li> We love this toothpaste, but every time we get it, it has fallen out of the box into the larger box.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste, not much more to say.  This one tasted good so I&#x27;d use again.</li>
    <li> Nice Flavor, not over powering... keeps my teeth nice and white... I would recommend... Kid friendly... &amp;#60;--- if that is important to you...</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this toothpaste! It has a good taste and does freshen breath well compared to other toothpastes I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. Not too strong, Feels like it lasts half a day</li>
    <li> Love the way my teeth feel after I brush.  the Scope adds just a little more to a perfect product.</li>
    <li> Had used Close-Up for many many years, until I got a free trial of this.  Never went back, even with 10 boxes of Close-up in my closet!</li>
    <li> I have tried many other Crest flavors and a few other brands. This is my favorite toothpaste.  Your mouth really will feel fresh longer than any other.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean. The double pack is convenient because it&#x27;s a product you&#x27;ll eventually need.</li>
    <li> This is tooth paste. It&#x27;s for cleaning your teeth. It tastes like toothe paste, feels like tooth paste, and smells like tooth paste.</li>
    <li> Subscribe and save all the way all day! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Box the toothpaste came in was damaged and toothpaste tubes slightly disfigured (but not leaking).</li>
    <li> I have been loyally using Crest since I have been brushing my teeth and this is by far the best Crest product that I have used.  The flavor is great and the product does just the right amount of maintenance whitening.  This product is not a substitute for another product, Crest Whitestrips, but will definitely prolong the time between uses of that product.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I am always using the Crest product.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully someday I will enjoy a discount on their products.</li>
    <li> Great deal. I purchased this using subscribe and save, and saved myself the hassle of purchasing this from the local store and the gas it would cost to drive there. This ended up being cheaper through Amazon. If you do subscribe and save and use Crest toothpaste this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Love crest complete. My teeth feel cleaner after everytime I use it.</li>
    <li> good but a little expensive</li>
    <li> My family really likes this toothpaste. It&#x27;s a little strong but it&#x27;s great to really give you that really clean feeling mouth.</li>
    <li> Great taste. Leaves teeth feeling super clean. Have this on subscribe and save so I meet run out.</li>
    <li> Just wish it came with small flip top, not the big one!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great for those mornings when you&#x27;re in a rush cause you pressed the snooze button too many times. With the combination of teeth whiteners, anti-cavity protection and mouthwash, you don&#x27;t feel like you skipped a step in your oral hygiene. It&#x27;s also very useful for when your out of mouth wash and need that extra bit of assurance that you&#x27;ve killed all the odor causing germs. I don&#x27;t like the flavor too much but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker. Leaves my teeth feeling really clean and my mouth not overly dry.</li>
    <li> CONTAINS-polyethylene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s  a plastic used in all kinds of things like garbage containers, grocery bags, bullet proof vests, even knee replacements … and now in toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walvaren said one brand appears to use the plastic microbeads more than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Pretty much everyone was saying that they were using some form of Crest toothpaste,” Walraven said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentist Justin Phillip said the microbeads shouldn’t be anywhere near your mouth.dentist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“They’ll trap bacteria in the gums which leads to gingivitis, and over time that infection moves from the gum into the bone that holds your teeth, and that becomes periodontal disease, Phillips said. “Periodontal disease is scary.”</li>
    <li> Works great..  not a messy gel, not a stiff paste..  only thing would make it better is a flip top cap.. so i just keep reusing the same caps from another version of crest..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have whitened, my gums are healed and healthy, my breath is fresh..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now.. all i need is 500 million dollars and i will be all set</li>
    <li> Shipped to my door, good value, saves time.  Product as expected.</li>
    <li> I dunno, what can I say? It&#x27;s a toothpaste. It kept my breath smelling fresh and it cleaned my teeth. I always buy Crest. I trust the brand and I like the flavors they make.</li>
    <li> Love this - it has everything to make your mouth, teeth &amp; breath feel clean &amp; smell great - the freshness really lasts!</li>
    <li> Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo</li>
    <li> This Crest complete toothpaste has the perfect ratio of freshness to cleanliness. There is a nice feeling grip that this toothpaste has when it scrubs against your teeth, so you can really feel the plaque coming off. In addition, you get the cleanliness of Scope which isn&#x27;t too overpowering. I will be buying more! 5 stars.</li>
    <li> such mouth refreshing flavor. Love it</li>
    <li> I work for a dentist and he recommended this toothpaste to help extend my in office whitening.  What is not to love about this toothpaste?  It leaves my mouth clean, fresh, and minty tasting.</li>
    <li> great toothpaste!  i hadn&#x27;t used this before buying on amazon, it&#x27;s really good.  nice, fresh, feeling.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite toothpaste.  It leaves your mouth clean and gets rid of butt breath.  will buy and buy again and recommend to anyone with nasty breath.</li>
    <li> Another item that I don;t have on my grocery list.  I love the product and it get shipped right to my door.  it is a great feeling that when I&#x27;m getting low, it automatically sends me more . such a fantastic idea!!!</li>
    <li> Crest has done an amazing job with its toothpaste over all these years. I have been using crest for years and I still have all of my teeth and they are all near pearly white. Relatively inexpensive for the price as you can&#x27;t really put a price on healthy teeth and I would keep using this for the years to come. 5/5 Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It does do what it is supposed to do however, the taste is not that great. The seller was great in that there was fast service.</li>
    <li> When you use this everyday your teeth do get whiter and love the fresh breathless.</li>
    <li> Best Toothpaste I have used and is very effective.</li>
    <li> We really love this product, it truly is minty fresh and longer lasting than other kinds.  We&#x27;re not usually brand-loyal, but this is an exception.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got to admit, my teeth are clean. But I don&#x27;t want to give Crest all the credit, floss is also doing some great work. Really I would say that they work best as a team. I don&#x27;t know where I would be without both of them.</li>
    <li> Taste gross- will not buy or use again sorry I got stuck with 2 tubes of this stuff :-(</li>
    <li> just as it supposed to be</li>
    <li> My husband asked me to get this toothpaste again, he had it in his travel bag. I love it too! Your mouth feels soooo clean.</li>
    <li> great flavor and works very well</li>
    <li> First try, I have to say it is ok for its price, just don&#x27;t like its flavor very much. It could have some more popular flavor...</li>
    <li> my husband likes this stuff.  I guess it does the job.</li>
    <li> As expected, better price than stores</li>
    <li> the two pack is perfect for this household.  I&#x27;ve always loved Crest, and love when they package it so it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> Keeps my breath fresh for a few hours longer than other toothpastes.  A bit strong when your brushing, but worth it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste can be summed up in one word - refreshing. It really leaves a slightly longer minty aftertaste than other toothpaste.  The whitening is not that much better than other products but it does show slow results.</li>
    <li> Good flavored toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever in my life really noticed anything in particular about toothpaste, other than perhaps the taste for the 2 minutes during which I&#x27;m actually brushing my teeth.  I didn&#x27;t even realize this product was any different until I started using it.  The Scope \\&quot;outlast\\&quot; flavor really lasts -- for hours.  The problem is, it doesn&#x27;t actually taste good after the fact.  I have no problem with the regular Crest with Scope version, but the one with \\&quot;outlast\\&quot; is something I&#x27;ll avoid moving forward.</li>
    <li> Why are people too lazy to screw on a toothpaste cap.?  I absolutely hate the new flip tops.  No matter how careful I am, they seem to come slightly open and ooze toothpaste all over my drawer.  This has a screw top along with a great toothpaste!</li>
    <li> For the most part, I like this toothpaste. I was expecting it to be extremely minty because of the addition of Scope - but it isn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s what made me leave off a star. I love toothpaste that is really minty and lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve been a Crest user since I was a kid - but this isn&#x27;t one of my favorite flavors. It has an almost sweet taste. On the up side, there aren&#x27;t any of those little plastic beads everyone is up-in-arms about. Not real sure why you need plastic beads in toothpaste...but this isn&#x27;t one of the toothpastes you need to worry about.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste. I feel like it keeps my breath fresh longer than others.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste.  It has flouride.  It causes my mouth to feel clean and takes away bad breath.  It&#x27;s the best toothpaste for me</li>
    <li> I feel a little bit awkward writing a review about a well known toothpaste like Crest. I decided to write this review anyway because Crest lately has been devoting a lot of effort into bringing new flavors and combinations to the consumer, trying to add value and differentiation to a product that most people don&#x27;t put too much thought into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, they decided to add Scope&#x27;s taste to the toothpaste, what was a good idea, as it ends up promoting both products (although some may wonder if people would stop buying Scope assuming the toothpaste already has it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, they came up with the idea of \\&quot;outlast\\&quot;, meaning that Scope&#x27;s effect would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intrigued by it, I bit the bait and bought it. After using it for a while, I must admit that I liked the idea as the taste of Scope is more present and intense, and indeed seems to last longer. They claim it \\&quot;feels fresh up to 5 times longer than regular toothpaste\\&quot;. The key on the statement is the \\&quot;up to\\&quot;. So, it could be 0.1,0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (pick a number up to 5) times, what is kind of tricky. Technically, the statement could be correct. Ethically, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that the toothpaste tastes good, does the job of cleaning and refreshing the mouth and teeth, and leaves a nice aftertaste. Just don&#x27;t expect the feeling to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a separate note, it is time for someone to come up with a toothpaste developed specifically for electric toothbrushes. I hate when I turn the toothbrush on and it does not spread the toothpaste well, leaving chunks that either go untouched or fall into the sink. Hello Crest, a good market opportunity here!</li>
