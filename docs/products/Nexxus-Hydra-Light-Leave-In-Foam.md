      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
      <li>I use with the conditioner and my hair has never looked so healthy.</li>
      <li>That was the way to use it - my hair was shiny and still had that bounce that I love.</li>
      <li>The most wonderful result of using this product is that I felt like I had no fly-aways the entire day!</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I just didn&#x27;t find it any better than cheaper shampoos that I have used.</li>
      <li>I like it better then this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Nexus shampoo has been a favorite of mine for many years.</li>
      <li>My wife tried out the product as well and enjoyed it as well.  </li>
      <li>The Nexxus shampoo lathers better though.</li>
      <li>Me and my wife are using it and satisfied.  </li>
      <li>see many reviewers love this stuff, and perhaps you will too.</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m glad I tried Nexxus out.</li>
      <li>Great new product!</li>
      <li>It really is a pretty nice shampoo and the conditioner is nice too .</li>
      <li>Nexxus Hydra-light shampoo has one of the prettiest, best designed bottles I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.</li>
      <li>My hair feels light, clean, softer and still has good volume which is really important to me, even with a moisturizing shampoo.</li>
      <li>It may be because I have extremely fine hair, so I can&#x27;t say that others won&#x27;t have a better experience.</li>
      <li>thing I noticed most after using these products in conjunction with each other was that my hair had a wonderful \\&quot;swing\\&quot; to it.</li>
      <li>IF you are looking for something light and cleansing I can&#x27;t think of a product that I have tried that works better than this.</li>
      <li>It also makes my hair feel fresh and nice.</li>
      <li>I love the scent, it&#x27;s a very light and fresh scent.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t come rushing out in a wasteful way, but also lathers easily.  </li>
      <li>Because of the way it keeps hair light and fluffy and the bright fragrance, I could see this being a great shampoo for summertime.</li>
      <li>Love the product line and trust a quality product that has been tried and true.</li>
      <li>Ah if only the shampoo were as beautiful as the bottle.</li>
      <li>If only the contents were as beautiful as the cover.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Id say to people with fine hair give it a try....</li>
      <li>If only every pretty book cover had a wonderful book inside.</li>
      <li>The Hydra-Light shampoo and conditioner work well with my fine hair.</li>
      <li>When lathering, I got a quick burst of citrus, but a flowery smell is the prominent scent.</li>
      <li>Biolage is one of my favorite brands but this Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Shampoo is an equally worthy alternative.  </li>
      <li>This product is, as its name implies, a light product.</li>
      <li>Our hair is smooth and bouncy.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully, it was light and didn&#x27;t linger on my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was the first time that I bought a Nexxus shampoo and I really like this one. It has a very pleasant smell and makes my hair really clean and It is certainly lightweight.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Don&#x27;t think my hair has ever felt softer, and yet, there is no residue weighing it down.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I grew up assuming shampoo was shampoo. The only differences I noticed when I got older was that some would leave a residue in my hair that ultimately required other shampoos to properly cleanse from my hair - which led to lots of shampoos purchased to find the ones that counter balanced one another. Wound up just sticking with something inexpensive that smelled halfway decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received bottles of Hydra Light Shampoo, Conditioner, and Leave In to try out and review for free through BzzAgent (also the Youth Renewal line, which I&#x27;ve also posted a review of - which didn&#x27;t work for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in my life, I have a shampoo brand and line that I specifically seek out. This stuff thoroughly cleans my hair, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t leave it weighed down. I have a LOT of hair - thick, very wavy, covers my back - and I don&#x27;t need to use as much of this as I do other shampoos. My hair feels softer and stays clean longer using Hydra Light. I was astounded at the difference. Shampoo quality was never an issue in my household growing up, my mother kept her hair short, so finally discovering Hydra Light as an adult, and that it works so very well for me, has been a huge eye opener. Being able to order it through Amazon is very helpful!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this shampoo because it is not a bit moisturizing.  It leaves my hair dry and tangled so much that I need t use conditioner all over my medium length hair.</li>
    <li> Great price, and I love the scent and feel it gives to my hair.</li>
    <li> Great price for this shampoo, around $9. It is that much or higher at Walmart or other store. I have long fine hair and it gets oily quickly. FIrst of all, this shampoo smells great. Very light and refreshing. My hair feels so silky for the next day and stays clean about twice as long as with regualr shampoo.</li>
    <li> I switched to Nexxus Hydra-Light after using Kerastase for a few months. Initially I was just using the 2 complementary styling products, and loved them, so I decided to switch to the shampoo &amp; conditioner. It leaves my hair virtually frizz-free - which is rare. I have fine, wavy, medium-length hair and live in a humid climate, so it gets pretty frizzy. If I put the leave-in foam in, I can sleep on it and wake up with perfectly smooth hair! I love it. Definitely good for the price. I just wish the conditioner could detangle my hair a bit better. It definitely feels somewhat heavy.</li>
    <li> hair feel great like silk</li>
    <li> This shampoo did great to my hair... I tried a lot of different shampoos--head&amp; shoulder-pantene-dove etc--but my hair got this smelly thing. It doesnt smells like clean. And my hair becomes oily. But in this shampoo my hair smells really great.....no more oily hair so far.:) thanks nexxus!</li>
    <li> I spent a few months getting shampoo and conditioner for my wife and daughter since they have longer hair.  It was a constant struggle to get my daughter to brush her hair because it tangled so easy.  After getting this shampoo and Nexxus conditioner through side by side testing it&#x27;s not a problem to get her to brush her hair and my wife loves it.  This bottle is expensive but it doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.  Definitely one of the better shampoos out there.</li>
    <li> This product is, as its name implies, a light product. The shampoo lacks the viscosity of most shampoos, which made it feel somewhat odd. It has a cool-looking bottle and color as well. The product cleaned just fine, but I didn&#x27;t feel the moisture described by the manufacturer as much as expected. I had no major problems with the product, but just didn&#x27;t feel that it was something special. It may be because I have extremely fine hair, so I can&#x27;t say that others won&#x27;t have a better experience. Overall, I&#x27;d give this 3-stars based on how it worked on me.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair strong and looking great.  Doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair.  I wish it had the same scent as the intense moisture - but the scent is not strong and it does smell good.  I use with the conditioner and my hair has never looked so healthy.</li>
    <li> This worked so well for me!  I have tried a lot of different shampoos and really love this one.  I use this with the living proof full conditioner and get great results.  I will definitely  order again.</li>
    <li> The Hydra-Light shampoo and conditioner work well with my fine hair. I do have to wash my hair often to maintain its &#x27;volume.&#x27; Nexus shampoo has been a favorite of mine for many years.</li>
    <li> would have given 5 stars if i had received a full bottle... payed $9.50 for 13.5 ounces and there&#x27;s at least 2 ounces already gone, no evidence of it leaking in the package it was sent in.</li>
    <li> Normally I don&#x27;t buy shampoos that are specifically for moisturizing hair. But the older I get and the color I put on my hair is starting to make my hair needs change. The Nexxus Hydralight Shampoo was the way to go. This is a nice citrus smelling shampoo that lathers up great. It gave my hair great body &amp; didn&#x27;t weigh it down. I also appreciated the pretty blue see-thru bottle. Great new product!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used Nexxus products before very recently and I have been pleasantly surprised at how much better they are than other standard consumer shampoos and conditioners. For one thing, you can use less of Nexxus shampoo per cleaning because it tends to lather up more efficiently. However, as has been my experience with other Nexxus shampoos, it doesn&#x27;t get my scalp as clean as harsher shampoos and I have to shampoo more often. Also, this lives up to the claim of moisturizing hair without weighing it down as evidenced by the amount of body and increased volume. This was very surprising for me in particular because my hair is very long and the weight of the hair at the bottom can weigh down that around my scalp. That didn&#x27;t happen with this. I don&#x27;t have fine hair, but, if you do, this might be a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the obvious benefits listed above, it also has almost no scent. This is actually a big deal to me because I dislike shampoos that smell like perfume. All in all, this is a good, clean, moisturizing shampoo which doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down with a strong scent or heavy conditioning agents.</li>
    <li> I bought the weightless conditioner and hydrating shampoo for the first time at Vons of all places because it was BOGO. Thought i would try it even though i was hesitant but got it anyways. It sat in my shower for about 3 weeks before i decided to try it out. The shampoo smells fresh and my first thought was \\&quot;wow\\&quot; it lathers very well and doesnt give a dry/stripped feeling at all like some shampoos do to my hair after rinsing. My second thought when about to apply conditioner (usually smelling it first) was \\&quot; do i want to put this in my hair\\&quot; I was not fond of the \\&quot;lard\\&quot; smell. Trying it anyways, i immediately LOVED, LOVED,LOVED the silky feeling it added to my long bleach blond hair! It almost immediately detangles without even combing my fingers thru my hair. Hands down Nexxus has become one of my faves! (And i want to.add that once rinsed out my hair never smelt like lard)&lt;br /&gt;My hair loves this line and so do i. Im hooked on it.&lt;br /&gt;I switch between this and Pureology. I tend to like strong spa like lingering sented hair products but ill keep using Nexxus because it just makes my hair feel so dang good!</li>
    <li> This shampoo lives up to the claims of not weighing your hair down. It is a clear shampoo, that spreads well and washes out easily. I just didn&#x27;t find it any better than cheaper shampoos that I have used. Currently I use [[ASIN:B00ADRH2OM Organix Shampoo Biotin &amp; Collagen 13 oz.]]and I like it better then this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down either and it&#x27;s less expensive.  The Nexxus shampoo lathers better though. I like the scent of the Nexxus shampoo.  It smells much better than the conditioner that goes with it.  I used to use [[ASIN:B003AYEG5S Herbal Essences Body Envy Volumizing Shampoo 23.7-Ounce, Bottles (Pack of 3)]]and I REALLY liked it, however, I have developed an allergy to yellow dye, so I had to find something else to use. The Nexxus and the Herbal Essence actually seem the same in terms of what they do to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see many reviewers love this stuff, and perhaps you will too. I am sharing my thoughts on it. For 10.00 a bottle, I truly didn&#x27;t find that it did any better, or worst, then the cheaper brands that claim to give your hair body.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it received good reviews.  The product contains isothiazolinone, a chemical that causes a reaction much like eczema for those who may be allergic.  If you are allergy tested, this chemical is one of the series of 36 different products that they will test you for.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the results of the Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Shampoo. It seems to make my hair softer and with more shine. Although it doesn&#x27;t seem to add the volume I&#x27;d like to have, it does give it a healthy look. It takes just a small amount to get one&#x27;s hair clean and suds nicely. There is no overpowering smell - actually I didn&#x27;t really notice any at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used with the [[ASIN:B00ALV8EJW Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 13.5 Ounce]] (as recommended) I was not pleased with the results. Alone, though, it works nicely!!</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo.  It has a pleasant citrus scent and cleans my long fine hair well, adding moisture without weighing it down.  However, I do think that there are other cheaper shampoos, such as those in the Suave and Clear lines, that work as well for half the cost.  If you don&#x27;t mind spending a little more, this is a nice shampoo.</li>
    <li> Overall, I am pleased with this shampoo.  It is certainly lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  However, it can leave it feeling a little stringy if I use it too many days in a row.  It has a pleasant fragrance and leaves my scalp feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> This Nexxus shampoo says it is weightless moisture, leaving hair revitalized and voluminous. It left my hair feeling as if it wasn&#x27;t clean with no volume at all. My bangs do not even look as if the hair has been washed. My hair is about 8\\&quot; below my shoulders and the shampoos I have been using haven&#x27;t even required conditioners. I thought this one would not, especially since the shower floor became slippery as I rinsed it off. I thought at least that means my hair won&#x27;t tangle; but many of the ends were knotted.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is also a very cloying sweet fragrance, not very pleasant in my opinion. This was just not a very successful experience.</li>
    <li> There was nothing in the description stating that this shampoo was for any particular hair type, but it is definitely not for fine hair. The description states that it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but it certainly did weigh mine down. I have had very good luck with Nexxus products in the past, but this particular shampoo just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. My hair feels almost greasy and it was difficult to style after using this shampoo. So, while this shampoo would probably work for a lot of people, if you have normal or fine hair, you may want to reconsider purchasing this one. It does smell nice, though.</li>
    <li> I really LOVE this Shampoo , I have fine, highlighted blonde hair, past shoulder length, this shampoo gently cleanses your hair, it suds nice and rinses clean and it leaves your hair feeling shiny soft and bouncy and that&#x27;s hard for fine hair :) I like the smell other have said they don&#x27;t this is a personal thing I feel, I have been using it just a few days and I feel an improvement in my hair over all.....my hair is not really badly damaged so perhaps not a fair test, but it is dry as well its blonde, but it is feeling really good right now !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id say to people with fine hair give it a try....It really is a pretty nice shampoo and the conditioner is nice too .</li>
    <li> I received this line of products as a free sample from BzzAgent to try and review. I have been using the Nexxus® Salon Hair Care Hydra-Light system in my hair for a few days now. My first impressions are that it smells great! A nice fresh scent that isn&#x27;t overly purfumey and gives my hair a pleasant smell all day without being too strong and competing with the other scents I wear. I love a great scent! My next impression is that it doesn&#x27;t take much product for this stuff to work and that more than makes up for its Salon price tag! I have to use twice as much of a drugstore brand to really clean my hair and then it still isn&#x27;t as clean as this shampoo makes my hair. I will review the entire line product by product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydra-Light Shampoo - I can use about a quarter size dollop for my hair that is about 4 inches BELOW my shoulder! I have long hair and it impressed me that this small amount easily lathered into a creamy cleansing solution for my entire head of hair! I loved how clean it felt afterwards - not squeaky and stripped, but just soft and clean. Since I wash my hair everyday, it is a must that my hair doesn&#x27;t get stripped in the cleaning process. I was very happy with the job it did. The only con I could see is that I think it really is meant to be used every day and skipping a day tended to make my hair seem oilier faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydra-Light Conditioner - this conditioner really does give me body and I really can tell their are minerals in this product - my hair was shiny and healthy but NOT weighed down. It bounced on my shoulders and felt so soft and manageable the entire day. The most wonderful result of using this product is that I felt like I had no fly-aways the entire day! Guaranteed, they were back by the next day before I used the product again, but for an entire 12 hours, my hair was shiny and smooth. I really appreciate that effect since fly-aways are something I deal with on a consistent basis and no hair spray in the world can keep them down! Again, the scent is pleasant and not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydra-Light Leave in Conditioning Foam - I have mixed feelings about this product and I think it may be a matter of application to make this product work well - I found that applying it all over tended to contribute to almost a weighed down look, especially near my scalp. So I tried applying it just from the roots to up half of my hair length and it was amazing! That was the way to use it - my hair was shiny and still had that bounce that I love. I also felt like my ends looked healthier and not as dried out. There is hardly any scent to this product which is nice since the shampoo and conditioner already are scented and leave a subtle hint to my hair that is pleasant. Any more scent would most likely be over powering. I also liked that this product was easy to manipulate thru my hair ends and didn&#x27;t clump in one spot like some foams tend to do - maybe that is because it is less of a mouse and more of a foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydra-Light Root Lift Spray - this is by far my favorite product - I have really thick hair, so I was worried about a product that promises even thicker hair - I was really interested in my roots being lifted  more than anything and this product delivered! I really focused the product more on my roots than on my ends and I was pleased that after drying, my hair had a lovely all over volume. I also was happy that again the fragrance was extremely subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I noticed most after using these products in conjunction with each other was that my hair had a wonderful \\&quot;swing\\&quot; to it. It felt thick and luxiourous but not weighted down and it really was as if each strand had been separated and hydrated. My hair moved fluidly and felt great. My husband also said that he enjoyed the smell very much. Overall, I would definitely continue using these products - I think there are some things that have to be taken into consideration - it really does need to be used everyday,and the products need to be used as a set and not picking out one to use here and there. I am over all very happy with my shiny, healthy and vibrant hair.nd the products need to be used as a set and not picking out one to use here and there. I am over all very happy with my shiny, healthy and vibrant hair.</li>
    <li> I always use Nexxus conditioners because they keep my hair very soft and silky without weighing it down.  This shampoo works along those same lines.  It leaves my hair feeling extremely clean and it doesn&#x27;t get oily after 8 hours or so like it does with cheaper shampoos and conditioners.  I also love this particular smell, it&#x27;s light and flowery and I can&#x27;t help smelling my hair like a weirdo all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture shampoo. I love the scent, it&#x27;s a very light and fresh scent. The shampoo lathers very well and a little bit goes a long way.  My hair feels super clean after using it, and it removes all traces of hair products from my hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using it, so it seems do a good job moisturizing it. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and it feels full and fluffy the rest of the day. It&#x27;s good shampoo!</li>
    <li> My hair has been colored (blonde) for many years so I have issues with dry, hard to manage hair if I do not use quality products to add moisture back.  Biolage is one of my favorite brands but this Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Shampoo is an equally worthy alternative.  And miraculously it does not leave hair feeling greasy or weighted down.  Sure this is a little \\&quot;spendy\\&quot; but for me it is well worth it and I don&#x27;t need to \\&quot;shell out\\&quot; as much on frequent conditioning or other tonics if I start with a good shampoo that works as advertises.  Plus I love the baby blue shade!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a Nexxus product and eh, it was ok. I used it in combination with the leave-in conditioner ([[ASIN:B00ALV8EKQ Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam, 5.5 Ounce]]) for 2+ weeks. This review combines them both, as I always used them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several hair products in the past, but I&#x27;ve never been impressed enough to switch from using my regular 2-in-1 from Suave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I didn&#x27;t really notice much difference in my hair, except for reduction of static! Now, was it the shampoo...or conditioner...or the weather? The weather has been changing, and I usually only have a terrible problem with static during the winter. Hard to say...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I focused on my ends when applying the conditioner. It, too, was ok, but I didn&#x27;t notice much, if any, difference in my hair for the extra step of work it took me. I always think foam conditioners are hard to apply evenly. Globs in one area, nothing in the next...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the shampoo wasn&#x27;t my favorite. It was more floral than I prefer. When lathering, I got a quick burst of citrus, but a flowery smell is the prominent scent. Thankfully, it was light and didn&#x27;t linger on my hair. Well, a very slight clean floral smell, but not like some shampoos where every time you turn your head, you get a huge whiff of your shampoo all.day.long. So, it was ok, but I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy this shampoo for its scent. The conditioner also had a similar floral smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think hair care products are hard to accurately review as everyone&#x27;s hair is different, so results will vary from best-ever to worst-ever! Also, scent is a very subjective matter! What I hate, you&#x27;ll love...and vice versa! So, you&#x27;ll just have to try it yourself - you may love it! For me, it&#x27;s back to good ol&#x27; Suave.</li>
    <li> Using Nexxus products has been something I have done for quite some time and I really haven&#x27;t found anything comparable to the way that this product leaves my hair.  After washing it feels cleaner than with many other shampoos and I really love the fragrance.  Just a tiny bit goes a long way when you have short hair like I do so no need to just pour it on.  I also have alot of those brittle gray white hairs and this silkens them like no other shampoo I come across.  Love the product line and trust a quality product that has been tried and true.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair shiny, not fizzy, and not greasy or heavy. I hate it when your hair feels slimy and dirty right after it is washed. I am buying this all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add, I have long naturally colored hair. Not normally dry or greasy, but prone to frizz with natural curl.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for a few basic reasons - the consistency of the formulation is easily used.  It doesn&#x27;t come rushing out in a wasteful way, but also lathers easily.  The fragrance is pleasant but unassuming.  I feel like it cleans my hair well, and I can go for a day without using conditioner and don&#x27;t feel like my hair is straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - this may seem like a small thing, but the shape of the bottle is very easy to handle.  There are times that with wet/soapy hands, I&#x27;ve found other shampoos a challenge to grapple with, but that is not a problem with this product.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for fine hair. It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is a  great shampoo for thin hair. This and the conditioner, works well also. My hair is thicker and fuller after usingit.</li>
    <li> I needed to try this out as I liked the design and color of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this with reservations.  The shampoo smells good and makes your hair feel a little silky, but after looking at the list of ingredients the bubble popped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to stay away from products with ingredients that I cannot even pronounce and perhaps Nexus can do a better job of using more natural ingredients in their products, especially their shampoos.  After doing a bit of research, I cannot say I would buy this just because of the stuff that makes it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if they put out, or already have, a better alternative to this, I&#x27;ll buy!  - Donna Di Giacomo</li>
    <li> I have fine, thick hair (my strands are very fine but there are a LOT of them). My hair tends to be on the dry side, prone to frizz, and is easily weighed down by heavy products. The idea of a \\&quot;weightless moisture\\&quot; product line sounded right up my alley and I was really excited to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product along with the [[ASIN:B00ALV8EJW Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner]] and [[ASIN:B00ALV8EKQ Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam]]. I found this line to be really nice - it&#x27;s more reminiscent of the quality one could expect from Nexxus back when it was a salon-only brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has a really light and pleasantly fresh scent. My first impression of the product was that it seemed thinner than my regular Nexxus shampoo (Therappe), but I found with this shampoo that a little goes a long way. It smoothed into my hair nicely and rinsed out easily without leaving behind any noticeable residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After blow-drying my hair I found it to be truly weightless. It feels noticeably softer and actually looks smoother. It&#x27;s amazing what a difference the right product line can make and this is definitely a great line for my hair type. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple weeks now and so far, like it. It helps smooth out and condition my hair, while rinsing out well so there&#x27;s no residue left behind. My hair feels light, clean, softer and still has good volume which is really important to me, even with a moisturizing shampoo. I took one star off because it&#x27;s not sulfate-free, which I kind of expect when I pay salon price for a shampoo. Other than that, the shampoo does seem to live up to it&#x27;s name of &#x27;weightless moisture.&#x27;</li>
    <li> I am going to be honest. I don&#x27;t buy into salon products and spending a bunch of money on shampoos. (I did a 9th grade science experiment with the class where we tested various shampoos and the end result was they all basically work the same!) However, I use a lot of hair product and sometimes after using the same shampoo for months it doesn&#x27;t strip away the build up as easy. Well, I&#x27;m glad I tried Nexxus out. First the fragance is neutral so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my shampoo competing with my perfume. Second, it is weightless, and a little goes such a long way. I&#x27;ve had it for over 30 days and have well over half the bottle left . (Just as a reference I have waist length hair).</li>
    <li> I keep my hair short, so I was a little skeptical about whether I&#x27;d notice a difference with this shampoo.  I&#x27;ve lived in a very dry climate the past few years and for the first time in my life have had some issues with dry scalp and dandruff: I found that those problems went away once I started using this product (and conditioner) ... even for my short hair, I noticed the difference in moisture retained.  My wife tried out the product as well and enjoyed it as well.  Personally, I liked the scent as well ... neutral (which makes it nice for either gender) and not overpowering (but not non-existent either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical at first, but I was quickly converted.  This product&#x27;s a little pricier than your average shampoo, but personally I thought it was worth the difference.</li>
    <li> This smells exactly like miller harris citron. I feel lucky to have stumbled on this shampoo. It also makes my hair feel fresh and nice.</li>
    <li> I really liked the way the Nexxus shampoo sudsed on my hair, then rinsed really easily, not leaving that feeling of still having shampoo in my hair. The scent is very light and pleasant. One thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle shape. It&#x27;s hard to squeeze the shampoo out with wet hands and makes it to easy to get to much shampoo out, wasting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very dry and the moisture shampoo left it feeling soft and clean. My hair is also fluffy, so there is definitely no weigh down, and there is no heavy or oily feel that comes with using some moisturizing shampoos.</li>
    <li> I used this with it&#x27;s companion [[ASIN:B00ALV8EJW Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 13.5 Ounce]]. They work really well together and left my hair clean. I didn&#x27;t feel any residue or anything on my hair. With my long hair, I tend to need a leave in condition as well, so I also used [[ASIN:B00ALV8EKQ Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam, 5.5 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notices much of a scent and it doesn&#x27;t leave much of a scent on your hair. Over all it is a nice shampoo and I would continue using it.</li>
    <li> I must say I was completely surprised by how light this shampoo this was.  I have spent years using shampoo that has extra stuff in it.  What do I mean by extra stuff?  Conditioners, anti-aging properties, and other agents that can really weigh down your hair.  This is completely light, and very cleansing.  I was amazed at my hair could get so clean with this shampoo.  I love that a little goes a long way.  Nexxus has always been known for their quality and this shampoo is no exception.  Very nice shampoo.  IF you are looking for something light and cleansing I can&#x27;t think of a product that I have tried that works better than this.</li>
    <li> If only every pretty book cover had a wonderful book inside. Nexxus Hydra-light shampoo has one of the prettiest, best designed bottles I&#x27;ve seen in a long time. The top is thin and perfect for smaller hands to pick it up. The blue color is a little bit of sky blue heaven in the bathroom. Ah but that color gives away a little fault in the beauty, there is a little bit of gray skies in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting on the shelf, this would be the perfect impulse buy. Ah if only the shampoo were as beautiful as the bottle. The bottle says weightless moisture. I would expect that to make my hair soft and full of... moisture. Instead it sucked all the moisture right out of my hair, making it hard to style. I have thick hair and this did me no favors. The smell might work for some; it is a bit too fruity for my taste. Kind of smells like the perfume people that use a pole wear. Not a sophisticated smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, the bottle held so much promise. If only the contents were as beautiful as the cover.</li>
    <li> This is a premium shampoo at a premium price.  It comes in a nice plastic bottle that you press one side of the top to open it.  There is not a lot in the bottle but you need only a small amount in your palm;  it produce a lot of suds.  It flows thick but not too thick that it won&#x27;t come out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job.  Me and my wife are using it and satisfied.  Our hair is smooth and bouncy.  It doesn&#x27;t dries up. It also produces a bit of a shine.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a shampoo made by Nexxus and I like it quite a bit. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, which I find most of my shampoos do. It keeps hair light and fluffy, and it does a good job of washing the daily oil out of the scalp. The shampoo is as clear as water and has a bit of a citrus scent. It reminds me of lemons, with just a hint of floral undertones, but not perfumy. Because of the way it keeps hair light and fluffy and the bright fragrance, I could see this being a great shampoo for summertime. The fragrance layers well when using the matching conditioner, which has similar traits. The two together work well to keep hair light and fluffy, and give it a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t a whole lot I can say about this product except that Nexxus Products are excellent. I&#x27;ve used Nexxus for years and for some reason, got more involved in more expensive salon branded items. The problem is after a while those items suck all the money out of your pockets and their effectiveness seems to diminish. Eventually, my dry brittle hair returned and I searched for a time trying to find yet another product that worked with the same results. I use this product once a week and it my hair is not as dry as it normally is. The instructions say to use on a daily basis, but as a Black woman, I cannot wash my hair daily or I&#x27;d have none, because it would be too dry. I imagine pairing this shampoo with the accompanying moisturizer will give my hair all the therapy it needs. Good products never die. Glad that I was re-introduced to Nexxus products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been loyal to Head&amp;Shoulders for years and I really like their shampoos. I used this Nexxus shampoo this afternoon and I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the quality. The shampoo itself is transparent and looks like hand-sanitizer. The smell is pleasant but not strong at all. In fact, I could barely smell it during the shower. The shampoo is easy to wash off which is nice. However, when walking out the the shower, I felt my hair significantly drier than normal. The feeling went away when my hair was actually dry. Right now (3 hrs after the shower), my hair is smooth and perfectly moisture (the feeling is much better than Head&amp;shoulders). Immediately right after the shower, I wanted to throw the shampoo away. A few hours later, when my hair was dry, I love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described. It provided moisture without adding weight or an oily appearance. My nine year old daughter has fine, curly hair; this product helped condition her hair and make it more manageable. I will definitely continue to purchase this product.</li>
