      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>i got this for prom and it was very beautiful and curly hair, I definitely would recommend it to anyone</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>.. love it..</li>
      <li>its better used for kids Halloween costumes.</li>
      <li>Easy to clip in as well.</li>
      <li>but now my hair is too light to wear these</li>
      <li>so I just got her a cheap thing, but as soon as I put them in her</li>
      <li>this cheap.</li>
      <li>I was expecting them to be cheap</li>
      <li>Beautiful long curls!</li>
      <li>Not the best quality but does create a different look that is fun to wear on certain occasions.</li>
      <li>It was full and not as described as some reviews.  </li>
      <li>Even though there cheap they ain&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>These actually work pretty good.</li>
      <li>So this is the second order of this type of hair and I am so pleased!  </li>
      <li>but NO they are worth it</li>
      <li>They look somewhat fake because they are SUPER shiny but look great :)</li>
      <li>Other than that, they work pretty good.</li>
      <li>I was worried ordering hair offline because you never know what to expect but this was beautiful flowy and thick</li>
      <li>This is my first experience with hair extensions</li>
      <li>and I am overall satisfied with what I got, although I should have ordered two.</li>
      <li>They are nice they look real feel real only problem is that they tangel extremely fast if you try to fix it will wont work very well.</li>
      <li>I was scared at 1st for it being only 5 dollars a piece because that is cheap for clip ins</li>
      <li>Got tangled extremely fast</li>
      <li>it does that job really well..</li>
      <li>SE ENTANGLED E STYLING AND VERY PRECUENCIA</li>
      <li>I have two of these ware very tangled</li>
      <li>I think the price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>The wait for shipping was not long at all, but was well worth it!</li>
      <li>Extensions looked real but may have some tangles.</li>
      <li>It has the look and feel of real hair.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t work it just gets straight.</li>
      <li>They blended very well with my hair.</li>
      <li>The clips are secure and the hair is really long and shiny.</li>
      <li>HAIR IS  OK IS  ONG  AND BLACK  </li>
      <li>Better off paying $125 to get real human hair that&#x27;ll last month&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>Freaking out that I wasted money and wouldn&#x27;t b able to wear them</li>
      <li>I mean  your own hair and listen you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>This looks pretty, but is really heavy, and the curl is more like when a white girl uses hot rollers and you get a big curl on the end.</li>
      <li>But overall they look like they&#x27;re real.</li>
      <li>it was for my 6yr old cousin who wanted some because she always wanted mine</li>
      <li>I just wonder if its possible to curl them or straight them.</li>
      <li>and I COMPLETELY RECOMMEND.</li>
      <li>Looks natural</li>
      <li>, I wore it right out of the package with just a little gentle brushing.</li>
      <li>And didn&#x27;t loose much hair.</li>
      <li>I just barely received my extensions today.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really brush it because it would mangle the look of it, so shake it out, brush through with your fingers and store it carefully to avoid tangles.</li>

<li> it is not as thick as shown in the picture.  </li>
<li> It was not as thick as I expected it to be, but for the price it was not that bad.</li>
<li> and it looks fake because of the color difference.</li>
<li> the quality is so bad I had one wear</li>
<li> Worst Extension I&#x27;ve ever brought!</li>

    <li> Beautiful long curls! And didn&#x27;t loose much hair. They blended very well with my hair. I absolutely loved these! I will deffinately buy again!</li>
    <li> it is not as thick as shown in the picture.  its actually just ONE track of hair and its really thin. so if you have alot of hair you might as well buy 2 or three tracks.</li>
    <li> I was worried ordering hair offline because you never know what to expect but this was beautiful flowy and thick I love it</li>
    <li> It was not as thick as I expected it to be, but for the price it was not that bad.</li>
    <li> although it took time to get here, it is a beautiful clip-on. It has the look and feel of real hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> I received my hair in the mail today. It actually arrived faster than the due date and I am overall satisfied with what I got, although I should have ordered two. The hair looks beautiful and smooth and all of the clips are in place. Love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered two sets of black for a wedding on the 29th of june. I ordered them the 16th of june and it said it would get here the 23rd of july. Freaking out that I wasted money and wouldn&#x27;t b able to wear them but they arrived June 25th. They are beautiful and they look just like real hair. I was scared at 1st for it being only 5 dollars a piece because that is cheap for clip ins but NO they are worth it</li>
    <li> This looks pretty, but is really heavy, and the curl is more like when a white girl uses hot rollers and you get a big curl on the end. Just so you all know. But for the price, beggars can&#x27;t be choosers. Good luck finding hair this cheap.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with hair extensions and I love it. The clips are secure and the hair is really long and shiny. I haven&#x27;t washed it or curled or straightened it yet, I wore it right out of the package with just a little gentle brushing. Very nice. I&#x27;ll order another set soon.</li>
    <li> Worst Extension I&#x27;ve ever brought! , they come tangled and if you try to brush them out and re-curl them it doesn&#x27;t work it just gets straight. Even though there cheap they ain&#x27;t worth it. Better off paying $125 to get real human hair that&#x27;ll last month&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> This was a sure steal! The quality is magnificent and the cost still didn&#x27;t amount up to the price I would have paid for one piece elsewhere. The wait for shipping was not long at all, but was well worth it! I purchased 5 and I&#x27;m very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> Good product.  It was full and not as described as some reviews.  Easy to clip in as well.</li>
    <li> HAIR IS  OK IS  ONG  AND BLACK  NO SE ENTANGLED E STYLING AND VERY PRECUENCIA DETANGLES LOSE IF RISO IS GOOD PRODUCT IF AUSARLO LEARN IS SYNTHETIC HAIR, THEN WE ADVISE YOU USED comb through L AND ALWAYS MAKE TO PUT ROLOS FIAR EL RISO</li>
    <li> Customer service 100% perfect! Extensions looked real but may have some tangles. But overall they look like they&#x27;re real. I love these hair extensions!!!!!</li>
    <li> i got this for prom and it was very beautiful and curly hair, I definitely would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for smh tangled up and gotten nappy after one day of wearing it</li>
    <li> Not the best quality but does create a different look that is fun to wear on certain occasions. Can&#x27;t really brush it because it would mangle the look of it, so shake it out, brush through with your fingers and store it carefully to avoid tangles.</li>
    <li> They are nice they look real feel real only problem is that they tangel extremely fast if you try to fix it will wont work very well.</li>
    <li> It cud have been thicker</li>
    <li> These actually work pretty good. I was expecting them to be cheap but they don&#x27;t seem to be. Though, I bought these to go with my hair that I had dyed a dark plum color but now my hair is too light to wear these and it looks fake because of the color difference. But that one is on me. Other than that, they work pretty good.</li>
    <li> You put this on in a few minutes no more piece by piece dread. Spread clip and presto youve got glamerouse long wavy hair and hey this product looks like it is connected to your head I mean  your own hair and listen you can&#x27;t beat the price. I bought 2 of this product and am going to buy another one.</li>
    <li> It was a good extension set for about a week...after that it was getting tangled and shedding&lt;br /&gt;But I did like the color/length &amp; way it blended into my hair</li>
    <li> They look somewhat fake because they are SUPER shiny but look great :)</li>
    <li> please do not buy products from this company PLEASE!!!!!! the quality is so bad I had one wear and it was totally knotted. the quality is so poor and it doesn&#x27;t even look real. its better used for kids Halloween costumes. be carefull for what you buy people.</li>
    <li> I have two of these ware very tangled&lt;br /&gt;Can ya shampoo them ????</li>
    <li> Got tangled extremely fast it was for my 6yr old cousin who wanted some because she always wanted mine so I just got her a cheap thing, but as soon as I put them in her she liked them to play dress up, but they got so tangled it was unbelievable</li>
    <li> I just barely received my extensions today. They look amazing. I just wonder if its possible to curl them or straight them. I think the price was reasonable. Well I&#x27;ll use them and if they are good I&#x27;ll purchase more for sure. Thank you</li>
    <li> So this is the second order of this type of hair and I am so pleased!  You CAN curl and straighten these justbwith a medium toblow heat. If they start to look puffy and messy, lay them out and run your straightener through it afew times then gently comb it out. Im 5&#x27;9 and these clip ins straightened touch my butt. Ive decided to only buy extensions from here as I&#x27;ve had some run ins with bad ones from other sellers and I COMPLETELY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Its easy to straighten and looks incredible. It just tangles, but its not real hair, so its understandable.</li>
    <li> I wanted one to add volume to my current hair..it does that job really well.. good product.. love it.. nice volume</li>
    <li> Blended in well with my dark hair. Wore to a wedding and it was a big hit! Looks natural</li>
