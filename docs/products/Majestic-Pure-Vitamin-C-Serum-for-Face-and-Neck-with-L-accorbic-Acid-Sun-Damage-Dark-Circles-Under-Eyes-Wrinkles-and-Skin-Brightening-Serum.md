<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not allergic to it! That&#x27;s great for me! Won&#x27;t know for sure if it&#x27;s working for a while yet. I&#x27;ll get back to you on that.</li>
    <li> This is a good product at a fair price however the packaging was poor and the glass dropper was shattered. The smaller box containing the bottle and dropper was open ( tape would have worked) in the larger  Amazon box and the tiny bubble padding wasn&#x27;t enough to protect the dropper as it bounced around within.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love it.  It was amazing what it did for his neck where at age 70 he has a great deal of sun damage.  It was so fast.  I cannot wait to see how it will be after using it for one month.  My skin changes are more subtle but it certainly is happening and my skin is looking better and better.</li>
    <li> I admit I enjoy having pretty jars of lotions and potions and tinctures lined up on my vanity table. It makes me feel like an old world movie star, surrounded by pampering and glitter. However, I only like to KEEP the products that actually work or show some benefit and I feel this Vitamin C Serum fits the bill perfectly. It goes on the skin light and non-greasy and absorbs quickly. It has a fragrance but it isn&#x27;t overpowering or unpleasant. I feel that applying it daily, especially in connection with your favorite cream, helps the elasticity and overall health and glow of your skin. They key, as with any beauty routine, is consistency! This extra large jar is a great value and will last quite a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having less issues with the acne on my face.&lt;br /&gt;My pores are incredibly smaller!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m preparing to do facials out of my home and chose products from amazon. I hope products</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have found this grade of Vitamin C serum in such a large quantity. It has the same weird scent as another brand that has worked wonders on my skin but became too pricey to use anymore. Even though the scent isn&#x27;t pleasant, it can be covered up. The vitamin C that smells nice doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my skin. So, I am hoping this will continue to improve my skin.</li>
    <li> I love using Vitamin C on my face.  It is a great way to keep my skin healthy and young.  Free radicals damage skin and cause the skin to age faster.  Vitamin C helps prevent free radical damage and keeps skin from getting that wrinkled, leathery appearance caused by free radical damage.  Collagen binds cells together.  As we age, we produce less collagen so skin begins to sag.  Vitamin C causes the skin to produce more collagen, which also helps keep skin looking young.  Finally, Vitamin C repairs the damage caused by UV rays and brighten&#x27;s skin&#x27;s overall appearance.  Using Vitamin C is one of the nicest things you can do for your skin.  I always buy Vitamin C but it can be expensive.  I was overjoyed when I received an offer to try Majestic Pure Vitamin C at a reduced price.  The Vitamin C serums I have purchased in the past came in tiny little bottle.  They are all around 1 to 1.5oz.  The first thing I noticed about Majestic Vitamin C serum is that the bottle is massive in comparison.  This is literally enough Vitamin C serum to last a year or more for barely over $20.00.  In addition, the product has a higher concentration of Vitamin C.  I loved using the product, just two tiny drops is enough to smooth over my whole face and neck.  My skin feels firm and looks bright.  Do your face a favor and order some Majestic Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> As we age, we slowly seeing the difference on our skin and finding a product that will help us, is a kind of challenging these days. I saw this product and tried it. There&#x27;s a lot of improvement regarding on the dark circles around my eyes and it&#x27;s not harsh to my sensitive skin too. It comes in a 4 fl oz and you just need small amount to use like 1-2x a day so it will last you a long time. It&#x27;s good product and I would for sure recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Been using product for two weeks now and I definitely notice an improvement in my complexion.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it regularly swears by it and can&#x27;t seem to be without it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see or feel any difference. I use it twice a day, everyday so far. The good thing is the price and the big size, but if it doesn&#x27;t do anything then....what&#x27;s the point? I&#x27;ll upgrade to a better review if it does show improvement in my skin after I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks on my face and hands and already see a difference in diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.  I also feel a softness in the texture of my skin improved a lot.  Vitamin C is a wonder treatment for skin, and this product is an excellent example .</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin c It let us skin so soft healthy and smooth like baby skin I cant live with out it really the changes in the skin are so great u can even see it and feel it in first application !</li>
    <li> Bigger bottle for the price, good. But the content seems to be watery which means to say the the Vit C content is less. I just use it for my legs and arms instead of my face.</li>
    <li> I am a skin concious and always want my skin feel so soft and radiant. I ordered this product becuase One of my friend told me it a beey nice product especially on the face so I decided to order it with a discount offered. It almost my one week of using this after I recieves and really I can tell and see the difference my face looks reaaly healthy and smooth and radiant even the skintone especially under my eye look really dull skin now get even color on my face i was really amazed and happy with the result, I will difinitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I use vitamin c twice a day. It has made my skin better.</li>
    <li> It did seem to make my fine lines disappear but it also left my skin with a sun burnt look. I am assuming it is a reaction to the acid that made my face red but then again I do have somewhat sensitive skin. The effects are short term but for the couple hours it did look look 5yrs had been removed from my face even if I had to deal with a little redness.</li>
    <li> Read the fine print. This serum takes up to six months to work. That is too long</li>
    <li> I use this product to get rid of dark circles under my eyes.  It is amazing!! I was surprised by how fast it works.  I&#x27;ve heard that this product also works wonders on wrinkles and that is a huge huge plus in my book!!</li>
    <li> I like to use this product after my toner and before other serums. It leaves my skin feeling nice and smooth and so far it hasnt made me break out</li>
    <li> First  time trying this product it&#x27;s been about  3 weeks I can see a difference. .love I hope they bring it back</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Serum 20%.  I just started useing the serum this week, I like this product. I did not receive any pdf, but that would be good to read.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_wrt_summary?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;asin&#x3D;B00WW0X1GQ</li>
    <li> I have been using a Vitamin C Serum for a few months now and have noticed that fine lines have disappeared. Obviously, not the deepest grooves, but I have noticed a difference. Majestic Vitamin C Serum seems to work just as well as the other brands I tried, at a much lower price - thank you, Majestic! It is not too watery nor is it too thick. It goes on smoothly and dries quickly. I did notice an, ever so slight, odor when I first apply it to the areas near my nose - but as I said, it is ever-so-slight and disappears just as soon as it dries, which is very quickly. So, I like this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of 20% Vitamin C serums. I have done my research and read all of the reviews on this product. Highly disappointed!! Does not perform, feel or have the same overall consistency as other compable products.</li>
    <li> Love my Vitamin C Serum!!!! Received a promo code for a review!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and recommend others to try it.  My guess, you&#x27;ll love it too.  It helps diminish fine lines on face, neck and hand areas. I do, however, use other face creams in addition to this product, but this Majestic Pure Vitamin C Serum seems better than others used in the past.</li>
    <li> The customer service has been amazing and the product is wonderful.  Been using it for a little over a week, I usually have skin irritations to new product and I have not had any using this...I have not had to wear make up, because my skin looks pretty good.  I will continue using it and hope for even better results over time.  I highly recommend this product.  It is really good stuff! :)</li>
    <li> This serum is great. It&#x27;s not much to look at. It is rather thin - watery like but hazy looking. Who cares??? It works. I started seeing a definite improvement in my face after just 2 days. My skin has always been rather rudy (I am a red-head) and this serum has evened out my skin tone and makes my skin glow. I&#x27;m also starting to show signs of aging (sagging neck) and this serum is really making a difference.  This serum dries very quickly on the skin. I did not like the dropper method, so I transfered mine over into a sterile 4 oz glass pump bottle. I put one pump into the palm of my hand and then apply it all over my face, neck, and under my eyes. People who know me say &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, but keep it up. You look great.&amp;#34; And that&#x27;s without any make-up.  I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> i love it , take it in the morning with a glass of water.</li>
    <li> Love Majestic Pure Products!  This Vitamin C Serum bottle contains 4 ounces.  That is a lot!  And you get a dropper cap as well.  Try to get those 2 things at a Health Food Store.  You get 1 or 2 ounces &amp; no dropper for a price 3 times as a much!  This Vitamin C has no scent-to me.  I like to also put this on my cuticles &amp; my elbows. My face looks brighter &amp; a more even color.  The red tones are gone.  I did receive this at a reduced price for an honest opinion. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I had been using another Vitamin C serum on Amazon (smaller bottle &amp; bigger price)....But I ABSOLUTELY loved it!! But, I decided to try this one and it is SUPERB!!... I think I may like it even better! My skin is smooth as silk, and looks wrinkle free!</li>
    <li> Since I have only been using this for a week, I can&#x27;t yet give it 5 stars, but it definitely is easy to apply and makes my skin feel good. It will take weeks to see if there&#x27;s an improvement in wrinkles. I did want to comment on one reviewer who said that this serum had such an odor that s/he couldn&#x27;t use it. I have no idea if that review is posted in error and refers to some other product, but this serum has NO odor at all - absolutely none. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and almost didn&#x27;t order Majestic Vitamin C serum because of that review; however, the guarantee was reassuring, and the other positive reviews said there was either no odor or only a slight one. I have to restate that I smell nothing - no odor at all. So for those of you hesitating because you&#x27;re worried about the scent - order with no fear of that. I&#x27;ll update my comments later to let everyone know if I&#x27;m noticing a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Arrive via USPS.  Was in a hot mailbox for hours.  Apparently the Vitamin C is dead now.  No tingle to the skin when applied.  Not even a tangy taste to it.  If it had 20% C, the heat destroyed it.  Haven&#x27;t tried to return it yet.</li>
    <li> Great product, even better price.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. It is light and absorb fast. My face looks soft and bright after using it. Great deal. Will recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it &amp;#34;straight up&amp;#34; on my face and neck, and it seems to be smoothing out my skin tone. I&#x27;ve also started adding a few drops to each pump of body lotion (into my hand) to reap the benefits on my arms and legs. Love it!</li>
    <li> I use on my face and mix it in a separate bottle with a couple essential oils. I add lavender and tea tree oil to it and rub it on my face after I wash. It makes my face feel replenished after cleaning it. I have noticed that my face is clearing up and just generally feels better. I know there are more uses for vitamin C oil I just need to start googling so I can try MORE! :)</li>
    <li> Love this serum, well priced it goes on smooth and dries quickly. It does not leave any sticky residue I use it morning and evening followed by a Vitamin C moisturizer. Definitely will buy again before i run out. Also  use it on my hands. Face and hands are much smoother than before.</li>
    <li> Mehh....I have bought other vitamin C serums that were so much better!  this feels like super diluted or way too much witch hazel.  plan to send it back to Amazon since it&#x27;s guaranteed.</li>
    <li> Majestic Pure - Vitamin C Serum - This serum really changed the entire way I do skin care-  I completely gave up all drug store junk and went all natural - the results are well worth it and you are not harming yourself or the environment.  Skin looks brighter and finer pores when I use nightly on a regular basis. Great product and large amount for the price that will last a long time.  Well worth it for sure. Got on a promo to try out and review and I am so happy I did.</li>
    <li> This might be a fabulous product, but I needed it for my face and only used once because of the smell. Went to a health store and bought one a lot better smelling.</li>
    <li> So far, I really like this. I just started using it, so will see more with time. Makes my face soft and no side effects on my&lt;br /&gt;sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, and with the large size it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> But this one is the best buy by far!</li>
    <li> This is some really good serum. I use this every morning as part of my get ready routine. It came very well packaged and the price is a steal.</li>
    <li> Very nice Serum, loved the quality of it. And the seller was very prompt in responding to the queries and gave a detailed description of possible other uses of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is great a great vitamin C serum.  I use the serum on my face and I have noticed great changes in my skin.  It had reduced the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  It has also helped to even out my skin tone. It only takes a few drops and I use it twice a day.  I noticed improvement in my skin within a week. I love that is all natural ingredients. I would recommend this serum!</li>
    <li> This serum is great! The packaging is great, the pump is nice, and the product comes out nicely. I use this after I wash and tone my skin, and I don&#x27;t use an additional moisturizer afterwards since my skin is so oily. This gives just the right amount of moisture without making my face oily or greasy.  I feel like my skin is actually starting to GLOW!  It&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;m so excited for the results already!  What a difference using a good Vitamin C serum can make!!!! I&#x27;m SO glad I found this!!! I have included a few photos of my skin after using this for about two weeks.  I have NO makeup on in any of these photos! :)  I&#x27;m also 34 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy this serum and have a great day! :)</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Product is too thin to adhere to my skin. I think the ingredients need to be changed so it absorbs and stays where you want it applied.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it works so good and does not leave my face oily</li>
    <li> Very good product! The viscosity is thinner than I expected but it works very well and a little goes a long way. M&amp;#60;y skin looks hydrated and fresh. Smells very nice too - best value on this type of serum!</li>
    <li> Good product fast delivery</li>
    <li> I received this for a review. The serum feels very nice and smooth.  My face is more smooth and moisturizer. I highly recommend this vitamin c serum .</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 2 weeks.  I wanted to wait until I was sure it was working.  I am using it on my legs in addition to my face.  When we get old are leg skin is just as important as our face.  It works wonderful, but is a bit pricey.  I may have to shop around since it is costly for my small budget.</li>
    <li> Ok so at first I didn&#x27;t know if I was gonna be happy with this but after a week I can say I am not disappointed</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try this product for review purposes &amp; have used it for a few days. This is similar to many other topical vitamin C serums. The science behind how &amp; why vitamin C can help your skin can be explored here: http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/anti-aging/_/how-does-vitamin-c-help-skin&lt;br /&gt;Basically it can achieve several results, such as lightening dark spots, fading acne marks, and just generally tightening &amp; brightening skin.  Even at 30 I still get acne, so I applied a few drops to some spots on my chin, &amp; by the end of the weekend they had faded considerably.  If you are familiar with witch hazel, that is what it smells like (&amp; witch hazel is an ingredient). The science behind the ingredients is sound, and the product isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Excellent, seen the difference.  it should have been little thicker, it runs down like water.</li>
    <li> I find it the best from everything i tried before for the same prise.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is of great quality and it is super gentle. I appreciate that it is mostly natural ingredients and the serum is really easy to absorb. I do see visible results after a few uses and the vitamin C brightens up my facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I have purchased this product with an introductory discount. My review is honest and unbiased.</li>
    <li> Great product, but it&#x27;s too much to use before it expires. This is one of those situations in which bigger is not better. Works well overall and is comparable to other Vitamin C sera I have used before.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly to my sensitive skin. No feeling of irritation and the smell is not bad.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on my face, and so far so good, I noticed that my skin is very hydrated!! I am very thankful because this is what I needed to moisturize my skin. The weather in Az is so damaging and oftentimes I get cracked skin, dry, peeling skin, and even pimples. I am glad I got this product!!! Will also be using this product for my bath melts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Got this product in exchange fo a review</li>
    <li> I have tried many Vitamin C products but this is by far the best ever! The lines around my eyes and on my forehead have diminished drastically! I use it sparingly morning and night. I will never be without this &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product again! In my opinion it is the most effective I have used!</li>
    <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? I&#x27;m a regular tester, so I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you! But before we get started, I wanted to note that this seems to be the exact same product as the Elleda Vitamin C 20% serum. Same ingredient list, scent, texture, and effects. This is four times the amount for a couple bucks more, so this is a super value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Hard to place - smells like cinnamon with undertones of witch hazel. No added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Slippery and moist. It’s thin, but has a gel feel going on.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Smooth, soft.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: I’d clear it for all types. Not oily or drying. I have very sensitive skin which cannot tolerate some Vitamin C serums, but this one is fine.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: Amber glass bottle with glass squeeze dropper.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Skin is visibly smoother and there is a noticeable reduction in depth of fine wrinkles. This is what got it its five-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid are the mainstays of this serum. These will both help your skin long-term. I would say this tilts towards the cosmetic and recommend it for immediate results, but would suggest finding something to use with it that contains more active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.and review.

    <li> i think it works.  liquid</li>
    <li> Majestic Pure vit C serum is a nice product, it is not as effective as others at reducing dark spots, but I have seen fine lines start to fade after 2 weeks of use. The serum is clear, runny, and fragrance free from what I can tell. It has a high aloe content which has been fantastic for me as I usually have one pimple in need of healing at any given time lol.&lt;br /&gt;I am a tester for Amazon products and have been given the opportunity by a product testing club to try quite a few vit C face serums and creams. I am not paid in any way, but I do receive the products for free or for a reduced price. I have targeted different problem areas on my skin for the different products to get a fair assessment of each formula.</li>
    <li> I think so! I have noticed a change with my skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is very oily and I am prone to break outs. With those things going for me, on top of that my skin is very sensitive. When I saw the words Anti aging, I just had to try this. It only takes a little of the serum.  I did not have a problem with this product causing irritation. I like how it dried out the skin with the hyaluronic acid, and then I felt it soften with the jojoba oils, and vitamin c.  It did help with the dryness overall. I am happy that it is 98% natural and 70% organic. I think we all have to be careful what things we expose our skin to.The product has a shelf life of 6 months but I have had no trouble using it.. I apply it to my face twice a day.  I received product at discount for my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great product, my wife has only used this a handful of times and there&#x27;s a noticeable reduction in the visibility of wrinkles, and her face was smoother with a new glow.</li>
    <li> very cheap ingredients I can tell I have bought the expensive vitamin c before and you can tell the difference. I would not buy it again</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this Majestic Pure Vitamin C Serum.  Smells nice (unlike another brand I used) and seems to make dark spots fade a little, which is very pleasing.  My significant other has remarked, &amp;#34;Your skin looks so smooth.&amp;#34;  I have not mentioned this serum, but take good care of my skin.  This 4 oz. bottle is going to last a long time.  I use a couple of drops twice a day on my neck, chest and face.  I try and rotate the areas I treat, that way I don&#x27;t overdo it.  Customer service is excellent.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It appears to work as well as the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Good quality vitamin c serum. Vitamin C can be used to brighten skin, especially on the face, to give a more youthful radiant look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majestic Pure is a wonderful line of essential oil and skin care products. They have great customer service and help you with any issues you may come across.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it. Skin texture has improved. Pores are smaller. Wrinkles not gone, but at 65 didn&#x27;t expect that, but they are not as deep. I have used another brand of 10% C for over twenty years but this is amazing. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I think more time is needed. It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but my skin looks good. I&#x27;m looking forward to good results.</li>
    <li> Highly, highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;You get a lot for your money here and it is a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use Vitamin C/HA serums on my hands as well since the backs really show age and with this purchase, I can use it on both my face and hands, you get a lot for your money here.&lt;br /&gt;Remember this is for UNDER moisturizer, not instead of and some people may need to work up to 20% Vitamin C.  this isn&#x27;t a placebo, this is real chemistry here so if you are getting redness/flakiness, mix the serum with some additional aloe gel (to stay with the same consistency) and work your way up to 20%&lt;br /&gt;This is probably one of the best overall Vit C values I&#x27;ve found on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to check the Special Offers and Product Promotions, this seller offers discounts often.</li>
    <li> This bottle of serum is at least twice the size of most bottles.  The serum has a slick feel, but it isn&#x27;t sticky and absorbs fast.  It has ferulic acid in it, so it smells like bacon, but the smell goes away after you apply it.  The consistency is watery and the dropper drips a little.  Don&#x27;t expect instant results.  It will take several weeks of twice daily use to see a difference.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 33, caucasian &amp; in great health, &amp; don&#x27;t have any skin issues but even after a week of using this stuff, my skin looks a lot better &amp; brighter! Ive even noticed my eyes look a bit more lifted, maybe thats from my skin brightening, but whatever it is, its because of this serum &amp; it looks great! I&#x27;m very happy with how this serum turned out for my skin &amp; am likely to keep using it. I am very greatful its available in this larger size, it makes a world of difference when you have a budget to maintain admist all the oath stuff you have to purchase in any given month-at least great, smart skin care is still very affordable. I really love this stuff, Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Only used for a few days, but very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a huge bottle, so it will last you a very long time. It is very good for repairing damages on the face that may be the result of acne or excessive sun exposure. Personally, it&#x27;s very drying on my skin and applying this serum alone, without a moisturizer, is too drying for me. If you have oily skin, this serum will be very tolerable for you. It may be very drying for people with dry or combination skin. Please do NOT be in a warm or dry environment after you have applied this serum. The hyaluronic acid in the serum is meant to absorb the moisture in the atmosphere into your skin; if you are in a hot environment, the acid may start pulling moisture out of your skin cell, resulting in excessive dryness. Therefore, have a fan or AC running during and after application of this moisturizer. It is a very healthy vitamin C serum for your face, but may be drying for some skin types.</li>
    <li> It works... Not a fan of the liquid consistency or the smell.. so I use it at night. I appreciate the price and the size. My skin tone is more even, there are less wrinkles, and I am told it is radiant!</li>
    <li> Quality anti-aging product; very essential for beautiful skin. I am 53, and use it twice a day, along with retin A and niacin serum. I have not experienced any irritation to my skin, and only very positive results.</li>
    <li> Just love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Product for review: product works as it states. Great product for the face.  I highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> I have tried several Vitamin C Serums in the last few weeks due to some review for product options I&#x27;ve been given. I have learned a lot about what I like and what I hate in a Vitamin C Serum and I wanted to share some of that here since the Majestic Pure brand is now the only one I will buy at full price. Here&#x27;s what is so great about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s Majestic Pure! There products are seriously the best I have tried in years. I will not go to any other essential oil after using theirs. Totally worth it.  If you want to know more about why, visit my other reviews on any of the Majestic Pure products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The dropper. I can&#x27;t say enough about the fact that this company gets those of us that use essential oils for lotions and in our daily lifestyle. The high-quality dropper is not only perfect for their other oils, but for this serum it is a must have. I can&#x27;t stand the pumps because you spend half the time just trying to get the right amount out of the pump and not air or bubbles. The dropper makes it easy to dispense what you need and get it every single time. So, yeah that&#x27;s a huge plus especially if you are using this as a full face or large area serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) There is no scent to this and no sticky residue. It goes on easily, dries within seconds, and there is no sticky feeling left. Perfect if you are using it before bed or first thing in the morning and you need to add moisturizer or makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It&#x27;s in a glass bottle. When they say 4 ounces they mean it. So you are getting what you pay for instead of paying for a bunch of plastic housing that isn&#x27;t marked as BPA-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great serum that is going to get the job done and be worth the price then this is it.</li>
    <li> received on time.  used only few times, so far so good .  I like it</li>
    <li> this is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;i have been using all kinds of method to lighten up my freckles. This is the most effective one.</li>
    <li> I still love the Vit C Serum. I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love this Serum C!!!! Absorbs into my dry skin; I have not seen any wrinkle improvement but it feels great on my skin! I will buy it again!</li>
