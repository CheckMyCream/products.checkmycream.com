### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The product is wonderful but it needs attention because I bought 9 shampoos and 1 of them broke the lid and leaked all over shampoo, liquid products box must be sealed</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously, I was impressed.</li>
      <li>It lathers generously and smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>I must say, I&#x27;m fairly impressed with this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>What a wonderful smell!</li>
      <li>and the smell was really wonderful and different--a tinge of tropical feel!</li>
      <li>It lathers beautifully and for the amount you get and the price I think it&#x27;s a great value.  </li>
      <li>This is some great shampoo that smells great and conditions hair in a great way.</li>
      <li>This works great for my hair.</li>
      <li>However, as time has gone on, I’ve noticed that that softness is now being mitigated by a great deal of dryness.  </li>
      <li>It has a very nice, fruity aroma.  </li>
      <li>It is not my favorite, but it is very good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a good choice for the price.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, it did.</li>
      <li>Consequently, a good nickname for her would be &amp;#34;Tangled&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It does do a good job of keeping my oily hair under control.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell that good to me.</li>
      <li>My hair feels and looks good after using it.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the pina colada aroma!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>It smells great, the shampoo lathers well, and my hair feels fantastic.</li>
      <li>Yes, it makes my hair softer which, in and of itself, is nice.  </li>
      <li>she used it and said that it lathered up nicely.  </li>
      <li>It makes your hair look nice except that</li>
      <li>It lathers nicely and you don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it, even if you have quite a lot of hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;Softness: This one is kind of a double-edged sword for me.  </li>
      <li>It is a very, very strong aroma that seems to be some kind of coconut/floral/pina colada hybrid.  </li>
      <li>The coconut scent is nice; I don&#x27;t find it overwhelming at all.</li>
      <li>but I can say that if they hold up as well as the detangling claim, then this shampoo might be near to perfect  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously too, if you love when your hair smells great but not crazy overpowering - try this.</li>
      <li>The Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 Shampoo is a good option if you are looking for a good quality shampoo!</li>
      <li>she did say that the comb and brush ran through her hair very smoothly.  </li>
      <li>This is an ok middle-of-the-road shampoo made by Proctor &amp; Gamble in the USA despite the &amp;#34;Aussie&amp;#34; name.</li>
      <li>the gray hairs more than they otherwise would.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is mostly coconut like a cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>My hair sure did not feel protected with its moisture-enriched serum, on the contrary, as I washed my hair</li>
      <li>For my hair, though, this product is mostly a miss.</li>
      <li>I have used and enjoyed many Aussie hair products.</li>
      <li>It’s almost like it’s beginning to leech the moisture out of my hair more and more the longer Iuse</li>
      <li>smell is okay</li>
      <li>(More on that in the “moisture” category.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(she&#x27;s 8)</li>
      <li>I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.    </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>think the easiest, most user-friendly way to tackle this review will be to take it claim by claim:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and it also leaves my hair feeling clean and shiny.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my split ends, shine or strength which I would think wouldn&#x27;t happen after one use anyway, but the shampoo did clean my hair well and had a nice scent.  </li>
      <li>After using it five times, each time my hair drooped and became &#x27;fine&#x27; hair, very very fine.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and produces a nice lather and rinses out easy.</li>
      <li>This one however doesn&#x27;t as my hair felt very clean after using it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>Thus it might not be the best option for people with dry</li>
      <li>To be fair, it may be to see good results you have to use the entire product line, which I did not have at this time.</li>
      <li>After the first shampoo, I noticed my curls stayed where I put them - so much more manageable!</li>
      <li>It also has the familiar fragrance of fruit and the beach, which I love about Aussie products.  </li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s for sure, practically squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>it detangles my hair easily on its on.  </li>
      <li>Aussie shampoo has the bright, vibrant scent that I associate with all Aussie products, with even a hint of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It lathers well and rinses out easily.</li>
      <li>For me, it’s not anything special, and rather than helping the condition of my hair, it’s led to more issues</li>
      <li>And if it tells you anything, my husband also commented that he really liked it too after his first use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pleasant, but I miss the old Aussie scent-</li>
      <li>it comes across as a light fruity/floral scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering</li>
      <li>What a great product Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 Shampoo by Clairol is.</li>
      <li>7N1 shampoo did a great job of moisturizing my hair, and left it tangle-free and shiny.  </li>
      <li>When used with the Total Miracle conditioner, this shampoo makes my hair look and feel great.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy this protect for the simplicity of using one product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Moisture: At first, when my hair was uber-soft, I thought that it was a pretty good moisturizing shampoo.  </li>
      <li>very good, exactly as I expected !</li>
      <li>Just popping the top when it first arrived  filled the room with fragrance.</li>
      <li>Does it make it super easy for me to glide a comb through after I shower?  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Her hair is clean, but not squeaky/stripped.</li>
      <li>It got my hair clean</li>
      <li>but it smells fruity and clean (which I suppose is associated with tropics).</li>
      <li>I personally don’t find it all that pleasant, but it’s not intolerable.  </li>
      <li>But I won&#x27;t be seeking it again as it just doesn&#x27;t stand out in any special way.</li>
      <li>As part of my many years-long quest to find shampoo at a regular retailer that&#x27;s as good as professional products you need a license to buy, I was happy to try total miracle shampoo from aussie&#x27;s 7N1 collection.</li>
      <li>The bottle didn&#x27;t arrive full.</li>
      <li>then I get a mild hint of the scent.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic thank you very much</li>
      <li>Overall very pleased and will purchase again soon.</li>
      <li>It tries to give seven benefits in one bottle and succeeds.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is very creamy - more like a conditioner, but it cleans my hair very well.</li>
      <li>So I finished with the total miracle collection conditioner I&#x27;ve already reviewed and liked.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say it&#x27;s a miracle product, but it worked really nicely on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I would say my hair does not feel silky smooth like some other shampoos but more of a squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>If 12.1 ounces would fit in a smaller bottle, they should have used a smaller bottle to better fit in my always full shower</li>
      <li>/&gt;Being as she also tends to have sensitive skin, it was good to see that there was no extra scalp itching associated with this</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>Mixed with that is a a bit of floral fragrance that smells like mostly lilac to me.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly three stars.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty frugal</li>
      <li>It was significantly easier to comb this out - without conditioner - than it has been for many other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product]] and  [[ASIN:B00GTC02LA Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle Light</li>
      <li>This is my first time using this product.</li>
      <li>I want to first point out that this was leaking.</li>
      <li>&gt; The top of the bottle is off center and shifted to the right.</li>
      <li>I mainly judge my shampoos on how my hair feels right after rinsing and this did not provide the results I normally look for.</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used and enjoyed many Aussie hair products. This one is up to their usual high standard. It lathers generously and smells wonderful. It is not my favorite, but it is very good.</li>
    <li> This works great for my hair. I have thick hair and sometimes a lot of shampoos leave it feeling like there is some residue left even though I&#x27;ve rinsed it thoroughly. This one however doesn&#x27;t as my hair felt very clean after using it. I&#x27;ve used Aussie products in the past and have always been pleased with them and this one continues that tradition.</li>
    <li> This is some great shampoo that smells great and conditions hair in a great way. It tries to give seven benefits in one bottle and succeeds. It is cleansing and leaves hair shiny. It moisturizes and prevents dryness, split ends, and breakage. The shampoo also acts to detangle your hair. It can protect your hair from damage and breakage. This shampoo can be all things to all people. I really enjoy this protect for the simplicity of using one product.</li>
    <li> What a great product Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 Shampoo by Clairol is. There is no need to use a separate conditioner. My hair is soft and easy to manage. I love it.</li>
    <li> This product completely dried out my hair in only two washes. My ends became dry and brittle. Its taken over a week for it to go back to what it was with multiple extensive conditioning.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Aussie products, and this one does not disappoint. It smells amazing and it also leaves my hair feeling clean and shiny. I found that even with long hair I do not need a large portion as it spreads and bubbles quite well. Overall very pleased and will purchase again soon.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo a few times, I realize that my quest to find a product that truly loves my spiral-curly, Afro-Caribbean hair still goes on.  My hair sure did not feel protected with its moisture-enriched serum, on the contrary, as I washed my hair it felt as if it were getting stiffer.  When I was young I once used a shampoo called &amp;#34;White Rain&amp;#34; where my hair felt like an unmovable block afterwards.  This shampoo here did not go to that extreme but I felt like I was headed in that direction and I washed it out.  After rinsing my hair looked dull, no light reflection at all.  I&#x27;m disappointed because I&#x27;ve always seen this shampoo advertised and I had high hopes.  It got my hair clean, that&#x27;s for sure, practically squeaky clean.  As for the tropical scent? I&#x27;m from the tropics and I don&#x27;t recall that scent ... but it smells fruity and clean (which I suppose is associated with tropics).</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for long, thick hair.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and it weighs down the hair (which is a godsend if you have thick/frizz issues).  It lathers nicely and you don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it, even if you have quite a lot of hair (again, something the long and thick crowd will appreciate).  I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say it&#x27;s a miracle product, but it worked really nicely on my hair.  I used it in conjunction with the matching conditioner, and together they left my hair soft, clean, and conditioned.  The scent is a tropical coconut.  It&#x27;s pleasant, but I miss the old Aussie scent- that scent needs to come back!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and I have been looking for a shampoo that will give me some body without leaving residue on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Aussie shampoo has the bright, vibrant scent that I associate with all Aussie products, with even a hint of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo washed cleanly away, and left my hair a little bouncy, which I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is in middle school, and even she approves of this shampoo! She likes the way it smells.</li>
    <li> When used with the Total Miracle conditioner, this shampoo makes my hair look and feel great.  I LOVE the pina colada aroma!</li>
    <li> The Aussie products are always a hit in our house.  My wife is a retired cosmologist and really knows quality products when she uses them.  Clairol has been a staple product for years and now this is no different.  Use this product and your hair will shine throughout the day and hubby will thank you for getting something that makes you luxuriate!</li>
    <li> I am usually an Aussie hair products fan, but I found nothing special about this shampoo.  After using and rinsing my hair I did not notice it being any softer, in fact I thought my hair felt dry or coarse.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my split ends, shine or strength which I would think wouldn&#x27;t happen after one use anyway, but the shampoo did clean my hair well and had a nice scent.  To be fair, it may be to see good results you have to use the entire product line, which I did not have at this time. I mainly judge my shampoos on how my hair feels right after rinsing and this did not provide the results I normally look for.</li>
    <li> Fantastic thank you very much</li>
    <li> I’ve been a fan of the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle products for quite some time, so when I saw this new product line, my expectations for it were high, to say the least.  Unfortunately, for the most part, I’ve met with a lot of disappointment using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the easiest, most user-friendly way to tackle this review will be to take it claim by claim:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strength: This one is a bit tough to judge, on its own.  I think that, after using this daily for about a week, I’ve seen a little less shedding (which my long, coarse, thick, curly/wurly hair tends to do a lot of), so this is a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Softness: This one is kind of a double-edged sword for me.  Yes, it makes my hair softer which, in and of itself, is nice.  However, since I’m trying to go with my hair’s natural texture in an effort to make it healthier, I’m staying away from blow dryers and straighteners and am really just trying to enhance and liven up the curls as much as I can.  This shampoo makes my hair so soft that it really decreases its manageability: instead of leaving me with soft curls, it weighs them down and my hair becomes a mass of voluminous quasi-waves with which it’s difficult to do much of anything.  However, as time has gone on, I’ve noticed that that softness is now being mitigated by a great deal of dryness.  (More on that in the “moisture” category.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Split end protection: Does it detangle the hair somewhat?  Yes.  Does it make it super easy for me to glide a comb through after I shower?  Nope.  In short, if this does offer split end protection, the benefits have been almost too slight for me to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisture: At first, when my hair was uber-soft, I thought that it was a pretty good moisturizing shampoo.  I don’t think that anymore.  When I use it now, I notice that my hair is getting progressively drier.  It’s almost like it’s beginning to leech the moisture out of my hair more and more the longer Iuse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humidity control:  It’s been pretty humid in my neck of the woods over the past couple of days, and while my hair hasn’t gotten as out of control as it has in the past in these conditions, I can’t say that I’ve noticed anything along the lines of a great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shine:  Here’s a category in which I can give it decent marks – it does help deliver some shine.  Is it a miraculous amount of shine, the likes of which cannot be delivered by other shampoos found in the drugstore?  Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoothness:  I think I’ve tackled that in some of the above categories.  It doesn’t seem or feel smoother, so much as just really unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final category that isn’t mentioned on the bottle or in the product’s claims: the fragrance.  It is a very, very strong aroma that seems to be some kind of coconut/floral/pina colada hybrid.  I personally don’t find it all that pleasant, but it’s not intolerable.  It does, however, really stay with you even after the hair is dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product disappointed me nearly across the board in all seven of its claims.  For me, it’s not anything special, and rather than helping the condition of my hair, it’s led to more issues and I think it’s making matters worse the longer I use it.  It might be okay if I were straightening my hair regularly, and some of the problems it creates could probably be mitigated with the use of a really good, thick deep conditioner.  For my hair, though, this product is mostly a miss.</li>
    <li> After using this for a few weeks I have mixed feelings about it.  For the most part I like it -it does leave my hair feeling very soft and moisturized, but it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of calming the frizz that my thick semi-curly hair is prone to have, although this is remedied with a little bit of hair product after my shower.  I like the scent - to me it comes across as a light fruity/floral scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering and I don&#x27;t smell it at all after my hair dries unless I hold my hair to my nose to smell it then I get a mild hint of the scent.  It lathers beautifully and for the amount you get and the price I think it&#x27;s a great value.  I would be happiest if it helped control or tame the frizz a bit so I didn&#x27;t have to use an after-shower product in my hair, but for a basic shampoo it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> This is the strongest smelling shampoo I have ever used. Just popping the top when it first arrived  filled the room with fragrance. When using it the scent lingers for hours. This shampoo can almost double as a full time room deodorizer.  It doesn&#x27;t smell that good to me. The fragrance is mostly coconut like a cocoa butter. Mixed with that is a a bit of floral fragrance that smells like mostly lilac to me.  I don&#x27;t think the two smells go together well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The top of the bottle is off center and shifted to the right. That makes it a little hard to use when your eyes are filled with soap. I don&#x27;t know if the bottle spilled a bit before it was shipped. The bottle didn&#x27;t arrive full. If 12.1 ounces would fit in a smaller bottle, they should have used a smaller bottle to better fit in my always full shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is not too thick and not too watery that it will run out of your hands. It leaves my hair shinier and softer than other shampoos. It also leaves my hair less manageable than most shampoo. My hair doesn&#x27;t necessarily stay where I comb it. What this shampoo seems to do is make each strand of hair stand out a is they all had an invisible coating. It makes your hair look nice except that the gray hairs more than they otherwise would.</li>
    <li> As part of my many years-long quest to find shampoo at a regular retailer that&#x27;s as good as professional products you need a license to buy, I was happy to try total miracle shampoo from aussie&#x27;s 7N1 collection. The scent didn&#x27;t appeal to me as much as the conditioner&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s tamer, less intrusive, and less long-lasting than the dry shampoo&#x27;s. I like the pearly white hue and slightly creamy texture. It lathers well and rinses out easily. No matter what, I always need to use a conditioner (and post-conditioner, often detangler) after shampooing, so trying to rate this 100% miraculous hair product in terms of results from shampooing alone is unfair. So I finished with the total miracle collection conditioner I&#x27;ve already reviewed and liked. Purple packaging still does not thrill me, but this product is shampoo in a bottle, not purple bottle with shampoo inside. And the price is reasonable enough. So try it! You may stick by it!</li>
    <li> This is an ok middle-of-the-road shampoo made by Proctor &amp; Gamble in the USA despite the &amp;#34;Aussie&amp;#34; name. It has a mild coconut scent that reminds me a little of Coppertone sun tan lotion. It goes on smooth and produces a nice lather and rinses out easy. I would say my hair does not feel silky smooth like some other shampoos but more of a squeaky clean. This is exactly three stars. Not bad, not great, but ok. But I won&#x27;t be seeking it again as it just doesn&#x27;t stand out in any special way.</li>
    <li> This shampoo promises strength, softness, split-end protection, moisture, humidity control, shine, and smoothness.  It&#x27;s a fine shampoo, but not a miracle, especially compared to the last shampoo I tried.  I do like that the scent is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just find that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t do much to control my hair&#x27;s tendency to frizz, unlike its promises.  It does do a good job of keeping my oily hair under control.  Thus it might not be the best option for people with dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good choice for the price.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does all it promises and is one of my favorites now.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product. I want to first point out that this was leaking. Amazon is a hit and miss on shipping out liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is okay, it is definitely a feminine smell. It&#x27;s not a clean or floral smell, it&#x27;s something in the middle, it kind of reminded me of what a candy smell would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair almost to my waist. It&#x27;s not overly thick but this shampoo definitely needs a conditioner to follow. II thought it made my hair feel like straw using this just on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan and wouldn&#x27;t purchase this.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo quite a lot.  It has a very nice, fruity aroma.  My hair feels and looks good after using it.  I use conditioner, so some of the (somewhat silly) claims on the bottle are difficult to substantiate, but I do like it.</li>
    <li> very good, exactly as I expected !</li>
    <li> gave this to the wife to use.  she used it and said that it lathered up nicely.  cleaned her hair well.  she did say that the comb and brush ran through her hair very smoothly.  after drying her hair was shiney and bouncy.  she likes this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Aussie 3-minute Miracle conditioner, and often use their Aussie Moist shampoo.  My hair is dry and tends to be frizzy and static-y in the winter, so I need some extra moisture on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 7N1 shampoo did a great job of moisturizing my hair, and left it tangle-free and shiny.  I didn&#x27;t need additional conditioner after using this shampoo. It also has the familiar fragrance of fruit and the beach, which I love about Aussie products.  I&#x27;ll probably have to alternate this shampoo with a clarifying shampoo, to avoid it building up on my hair and leaving it flat, but for the days when I need some extra moisture and shine, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> Over the last few years I&#x27;ve gotten to try a whole lot of shampoos and there have been a handful that I&#x27;ve really liked.  None of them though could do what the Aussie 7N1 shampoo did -- and that&#x27;s left my hair in such a non-tangled state that I didn&#x27;t need a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should tell you that I have long hair that is brown with lots of wild gray renegade hairs.  Worse, some of these hairs have inherited my mom&#x27;s Spanish curliness, which means that overnight or in the shower my mop of hair can get some terrible tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hair maintenance, and when I&#x27;m not testing a new shampoo, I always use a conditioner in the shower.  And afterwards I usually use [[ASIN:B002CMLHEC It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product]] and  [[ASIN:B00GTC02LA Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle Light Leave-in Cream]]... together.  The combo allows me to get a wide tooth comb through my hair without a lot of breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... I didn&#x27;t have to do this with the AUSSIE 7N1!  All I used was the shampoo and after I towel dried my hair I could run the wide-tooth comb through it with no problem.  Needless to say I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN THE SHOWER&lt;br /&gt;In the shower I noticed a difference. The shampoo felt thick and even had a &#x27;slick&#x27; element to it.  In addition it only took a small amount to create lots of suds.  I&#x27;m pretty frugal but I found I was using too much at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I was impressed. This shampoo is the only one that has ever left my mid-back length hair in such a smooth state that I didn&#x27;t need both a conditioner or detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was dry my hair was very shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> While I am always skeptical at trying shampoos that claim to do it all, I was pleasantly surprised by the results of using this shampoo.  I have very long, thick hair.  After one use, I could tell this shampoo was different than most.. and with repetitive use have found even more benefits to using it.  My hair is softer, shinier, smoother.. my biggest surprise was not having to use conditioner with this shampoo.. it detangles my hair easily on its on.  And if it tells you anything, my husband also commented that he really liked it too after his first use.  We will definitely buy and use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I cannot say this is a miracle collection, but it does wash my hair well, hair feels soft after use. Nothing outstandingly different that I can feel between my hair before using this and after. I do like Aussie products though, and would buy again just as an Aussie shampoo.</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful but it needs attention because I bought 9 shampoos and 1 of them broke the lid and leaked all over shampoo, liquid products box must be sealed</li>
    <li> What a wonderful smell! Thick and smooth, I just needed to use a little of this shampoo and it went a long way! ... and the smell was really wonderful and different--a tinge of tropical feel! The Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 Shampoo is a good option if you are looking for a good quality shampoo!</li>
    <li> Aussie has always offered a solid line for a cheap price. I know a lot of people who swear by this brand and I also have never been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Miracle shampoo and conditioner is no different. It smells great, the shampoo lathers well, and my hair feels fantastic. The conditioner is thick and creamy, washes out easily and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously too, if you love when your hair smells great but not crazy overpowering - try this. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. My hair tangles a lot, but not with this shampoo. And that&#x27;s without using a conditioner after the shampoo! After the first shampoo, I noticed my curls stayed where I put them - so much more manageable! The shampoo is very creamy - more like a conditioner, but it cleans my hair very well. The coconut scent is nice; I don&#x27;t find it overwhelming at all. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.    My hair is coarse and frizzy.  This shampoo made my hair soft, too soft.  After using it five times, each time my hair drooped and became &#x27;fine&#x27; hair, very very fine.  I had none of my natural waves or body ... it just hung there even after my normal blow drying procedure.    After the first time, I thought that my usual condition did not react well with this shampoo, so I didn&#x27;t use it in the subsequent shampoos.  Nothing changed it still just hung there, perfectly straight.    This is the first time in my life that my hair has ever been fine, and now I know and feel sorry for others with hair like this, it is a very different experience.</li>
    <li> My daughter has hair that is...a pain. It&#x27;s long, she doesn&#x27;t brush it very well (she&#x27;s 8) and it gets glued to her head every so often for a gymnastics meet. Consequently, a good nickname for her would be &amp;#34;Tangled&amp;#34;. We are constantly on the lookout for a shampoo that works well on her hair to clean it without stripping it, and to help make it even a *little* bit easier to get the tangles out after washing. I must say, I&#x27;m fairly impressed with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her hair is clean, but not squeaky/stripped. I deliberately avoided putting conditioner on before I combed because I wanted to see whether the &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; claim had any validity. Surprisingly, it did. It was significantly easier to comb this out - without conditioner - than it has been for many other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being as she also tends to have sensitive skin, it was good to see that there was no extra scalp itching associated with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that this shampoo meets ALL of its claims - but I can say that if they hold up as well as the detangling claim, then this shampoo might be near to perfect  :)  I think this will probably be our new go-to shampoo for The Gymnast.</li>
