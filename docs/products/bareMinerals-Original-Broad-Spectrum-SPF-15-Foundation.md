<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Before I ever read any of the reviews, I knew from the moment I swiped it on my face that this was NOT the real Bare Minerals!!!! I will never order BM from Amazon again!!!! Definitely disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love BareMinerals.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and still love what it does for my skin.  It does everything it claims.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the same shade for years.  I have always bought it through Sephora but I saw this and I thought it was a great price.  Well, you get what you pay for.  The powder consistency is different and it does not cover no matter how much you use.  I ordered one from Sephora after this one thinking that maybe BareMinerals had changed their formula.  But no.  It was as it had always been.  I don&#x27;t know what is in this one but it is no BareMinerals.</li>
    <li> This foundation provides natural-looking coverage.  Unfortunately, even with a primer and moisturizer, it dries out my skin.  I cannot use it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> With this your face is never oily or greasy and your pores are often healthier than they were before using it!</li>
    <li> This foundation is perfect color for medium skin tones...it&#x27;s described as fairly light, but it&#x27;s not that light and covers nicely. I use it on top of my foundation and blush as an overall finishing touch...it doesn&#x27;t cake or flake and stays natural looking all day.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using Bare Essecentials make up for almost 7 years now and she absolutely loves it! What a great combo, Amazon + her make up!</li>
    <li> After ordering this product several times through amazon in order to save money, I am now convinced it is not the real thing.  After reading several reviews stating a similar concern, I purchased the product at Nordstrom&#x27;s department store today to compare.  All I can say is, I am happy that BareMinerals has not changed its formula -- this is what I remember it to be.  I thought I was saving money by purchasing it on amazon, but I was going through a container every two weeks instead of every 4-5 weeks.  Now I know why -- the coverage was minimal and I had to use more of it.  Also, I think the color is off because I just didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;look as good&amp;#34; after using it from the online vendor.  Glad to be back to my old, original, authentic product -- from the store.  Too bad the consumer must beware of everything.</li>
    <li> I have used BareMinerals for years now.  I have very sensitive skin and it is the only makeup that doesn&#x27;t break me out.  This was my first time ordering it from somewhere other than the official website.  I just joined amazon and thought I&#x27;d look for a cheaper price.  When it can it looked like the normal packaging but once I started using it I started breaking out horrible.  I also noticed that it didn&#x27;t cover as well as normal so I started comparing it to an old jar of BareMinerals.  The sticker on the bottom is slightly different and doesn&#x27;t have the printed code that the original had, and when I compared the powder you could really tell it was different.  If you want the real thing go to the bareminerals website!</li>
    <li> This product is really good. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve gotten a little too tan this summer and it doesn&#x27;t really work with my skin tones anymore. But this will be a great winter foundation.</li>
    <li> My favorite foundation.  Light, gentle with good coverage.  Best makeup ever.</li>
    <li> THIS IS FAKE JUNK!!!!!! THEY THINK WE CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE? I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR 10 YEARS. THIS IS COLORED BABY POWDER. IT DOES NOT COVER AT ALL AND IS THE WRONG COLOR. THE REAL BAREMINERALS COVERES WITH ONE DIP OF THE BRUSH. I USED HALF OF THIS ALREADY WITH ZERO COVERAGE. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS PARTY AGAIN!</li>
    <li> This is NOT the real B.M. that I always got from Ulta. It feels like I&#x27;m brushing baby powder on my face...it even SMELLS like baby powder! It has ZERO coverage. I tried to save some money, but it was definitely not worth it. I&#x27;ll be heading to Ulta to pay full price for the REAL thing. This is nothing but a cheap knock off. The packaging is extremely deceiving because it looks just like the real thing! But do not be fooled by this...it is most definitely NOT the real thing.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and was as described. I neglected to read the gram amount in the description and the item is bigger than what I was imagining. So...bonus for me!</li>
    <li> Love it would use any thing alse. Been using it for a lot of years. It keeps my skin rell.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery -very happy with the product</li>
    <li> This is the only make up I ever wear! You don&#x27;t feel like your face is covered with products. Bare Minerals is light &amp; always feels great on the skin!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this!&lt;br /&gt;This is Baby Powder, provides no coverage, not real bare minerals...&lt;br /&gt;You could tell by looking at the label on the  bottom of the container.&lt;br /&gt;It was peeled off of a real product and glued on the this container.</li>
    <li> I just simple prefer the matte fairly light foundation. I feel this one is a bit lighter than I&#x27;m used to</li>
    <li> I was concerned with some of the reviews that stated the product was &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or in someway not the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; BareMinerals.  I had an Amazon gift card and decided to go ahead and order it.  I&#x27;ve used BareMinerals for multiple years and always use the same color (fairly light). This was EXACTLY the same product that I&#x27;ve been purchasing from a chain beauty store. The coverage is perfect, the color is exactly as anticipated, and it makes my acne-prone skin look smooth, radiant, and the all natural product helps keep my face clear.  I obviously had a much better experience than other purchasers, who felt their item was fake or a knock-off. As a BareMineral devotee and constant user, my experience is that the product I received was NOT a fake and is exactly like what I&#x27;ve been purchasing at the large beauty stores (and almost $10 less expensive from Amazon!) All-in-all, I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and 100% confident that this is the &amp;#34;real-deal&amp;#34;!!!</li>
    <li> The coverage is not what I had hoped.  It blends well and looks natural but doesn&#x27;t even out my skin tone nearly as well as Sheer Cover.</li>
    <li> Have used this item forever and just love the beautiful finish this powder provides!  This is an excellent product and the price and shipping were great!</li>
    <li> the lightest color still is a bit orange but overall i love how smooth it makes my skin look</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and several other Bare Minerals products for a few years. I love them all.</li>
    <li> I just keep re-ordering the same color and style of makeup because I love it so much!  It evens skin tone and covers blemishes without making you look like you have layers of foundation on. I highly recommend this line of mineral makeup.</li>
    <li> Great product! Loved the quality of this makeup. Tends to get a little shinny if worn for a long period of time.</li>
    <li> This is a great foundation! My friend introduced me to this brand and I am very happy with it. I think it is great that they try to avoid putting toxic chemicals in their makeup.</li>
    <li> I hate makeup, but my complexion is terrible. This stuff is a life saver though. It takes about 30 seconds to brush on, and it doesn&#x27;t look cakey and fake like liquids do. It&#x27;s good for my &amp;#34;no-makeup&amp;#34; Makeup style. And my skin is really sensitive, but I&#x27;ve never had an issue with this. I&#x27;m very pale (as in my tattoo artist said he wasn&#x27;t going to bother with white ink for my &amp;#34;white tree&amp;#34; tattoo... &amp;#34;You&#x27;re pretty much as pale as they come, so filling in with white ink would be redundant&amp;#34; were the exact words.) This is a good colour for me. I would say some come paler, but as a part German and Irish gal, I&#x27;m pretty dang pale, and the Fairly Light colour looks great for me. And it lasts nearly all day too. Whatever your skin type or colour, I recommend this brand, and if you&#x27;re pale like me, Fairly Light is a good colour.</li>
    <li> Great product! Feels and looks great on the skin - Natural and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Great value for this product.</li>
    <li> This foundation paired with the bronzer changed my life! My make up is so natural looking and the powder is light. Good bye thick foundation and heavy make-up!! I love it. I recommend going to a make-up bar first and have a consultant help you choose a color to match your skin and then replenish for cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It never looks caked on and can provide excellent coverage.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used bare minerals for years I love the ease of it. Takes minutes to apply and it covers pretty well. I never use mineral veil either and still love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Goes on so light but hides all the flaws. I have switched make up now!</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals and largely credit the stuff with helping me lose the college acne that I had been covering up with store bought creams. A great product!</li>
    <li> I had the bareminerals when it first came out. I think they have just gotten better. love love love this</li>
    <li> I believe this wasn&#x27;t the original bare mineral foundation that I usually buy it from Ulta. Please verify the products before selling them. The one that I got was for sure a fake one.....:-((</li>
    <li> I love using this product. It makse my skin look smooth and evens out the skin tones. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love the spf  it goes on so soft and smooth and breakouts or stinging this is a very nice Little jar of powder it is not a large jar</li>
    <li> Color too dark hard to order on line.</li>
    <li> just like everyone else says it&#x27;s too powdery (like baby powder) regardless of how this seller lists the product I have used other mineral makeups and this one just doesn&#x27;t match up to everything else I&#x27;ve used. Coverage isn&#x27;t good, doesn&#x27;t stay on long and It has a perfumey smell too, so something is amiss...not surprising since the seller I bought it from (ONSALE24HRS) is a horrible seller and lied about the item being in stock when it wasn&#x27;t.  Spend a few extra bucks and go buy it at Ulta or somewhere else at least you&#x27;ll get a legitimate product from a store that appreciates their customer unlike the joke store on here that I bought mine from.  I use amazon all the time and literally buy almost everything on here and I&#x27;m usually very happy and satisfied with my purchases; but I am VERY DISAPPOINTED with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Product was what I thought I was purchasing. Love this color. It is for pale skin color. Will order again. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this makeup. It makes you appear like you have none on but covers excellent. Color was perfect for my skin tone ! Will order again.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these because the price was amazing....got these for $11.99 a piece!  I would probably buy more but don&#x27;t need any now....  it&#x27;s hard to find this stuff for under $20, but if you keep checking Amazon, you might get lucky like I did.  I love Bare Minerals, and with my Sigma kabuki brush, WOW....my skin looks like porcelain.  I also use Salma Hayek&#x27;s Am/Pm Age Defying Super Cream as a moisturizer and the combination is a winner!!!  I would highly recommend Bare Minerals as a perfect foundation for any skin type.</li>
    <li> color is very chalky, i stopped buying any bare mineral products on amazon, i dont beleive they are legit, i only buy them at ulta now and they are perfect</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I ordered faster than anticipated. I would highly recommend going through them to anyone! Very impressed and happy with sender</li>
    <li> Best makeup money can buy next to Est&amp;eacute;e lauder. I still use it as finishing powder. Best for younger skin. Fast ship, good price from this seller.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 15 years.  I love it.  It gives me a natural look and at the same time it covers all spots, blemishes, etc.  Wonderful makeup.</li>
    <li> It has a good natural coverage that is transparent and distributes well. I will continue to buy it, since it is 100% purely mineral based with no other chemicals added. Great product, good color, although a little darker than I  expected based on its title: &amp;#34;Fairly Light&amp;#34; , I am very fair-skinned, and, it is a skosh darker. Still not that noticeable though. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Love its coverage! Shipped very fast! I will continue to buy again! The price is definitely right!</li>
    <li> I had a smaller size that my sister gave to me because it was too light for her (lucky me) and that lasted me over a year! This is bigger and I know will last me even longer. Great product. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I Love It! I&#x27;ve been using bareminerals for many years now, it&#x27;s the best powder ever!!!!!!!!! I definetely recommend it to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
    <li> Do you know if your skin tone is warm or cool?  If you do, It will help you pick the right color.  The color N10 indicates this is a neutral color. If you&#x27;re cool toned, look for the C-numbers. Warm?  Look for the W-numbers.  If you don&#x27;t know which you are, Google it and find the 3 or 4 questions they&#x27;ll ask you to figure it out.  It&#x27;s hard for me sometimes to tell if the color is right just by looking at it, but now that I know I&#x27;m cool toned it&#x27;s easier to pick the right make- up color.  I love Bare Minerals.  It&#x27;s a touch messy, but I like the way it looks on my skin especially when I start with the right color.  The price is great here on Amazon.  Much cheaper than I&#x27;ve been buying it for the last two years!</li>
    <li> Good product-quick shipment</li>
    <li> Been using the product for at least 10 years. It works so well.</li>
    <li> Love this product use it every day. I have been using Bare Mineral for several years and really like most of their products.</li>
    <li> Love home delivery. local retailers too far for me to want to drive to get it.</li>
    <li> Not the same stuff you are use to buying like all the people complain about.  But it is real product just not the newest in the container you are buying direct.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, that&#x27;s always a plus! Product was exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;ve been using BareMinerals for years and I&#x27;ve never had anything bad to say about it. I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals!  It is best used with the primer-I wear it all day and my skin does not get oily!</li>
    <li> I received the package much in advance compared to the expected delivery date, thank God, because I am just down to the tiniest bit on my 2g foundation. It was extremely well packaged and protected, I even had trouble getting through the bubble wrap! :) I&#x27;ve never used the 8g foundation so it looked as though the amount of foundation was too little compared to the container but once you uncap, you realize that the product is very new and very much full--you get exactly what you ordered. I highly recommend this product and the seller!</li>
    <li> I can never say enough about bare minerals. I am very fair complected &amp; it has been hard to find a right shade for me. Bare minerals has solved the problem. It looks so natural &amp; stays on until you take it off. It is the only make up I will wear! Love it</li>
    <li> Wow!!! I have large pores and they stayed hidden while wearing this product.  I actually had people say how nice my skin is. Will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> I always struggled to find a good shade of foundation and have always hated the heavy feeling of liquid foundation but this stuff is so light and hides skin imperfections like no other foundation out there.</li>
    <li> exactly as expected, and we purchase from the Bare Minerals store and Ulta and this was an authentic jar of Bare Escentuals/Bare Minerals product.</li>
    <li> Since my skin is very sensitive, I have to be careful with the makeup products I select. Unlike many other products I have tried, Bare Minerals never makes my skin break out with acne or rashes. Bare Minerals does its job and does it well. I just received my product this afternoon, so I have not had the chance to use this particular container yet, but it looks just like the Bare Minerals I used to buy and I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the real Bare Minerals product. It is a fake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using BareMinerals make-up for a few years now. I love it. I look great without that heavy-makeup look. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay loose powder and I was told that they weren&#x27;t selling the one I was using anymore, so I bought this on Amazon since it was cheaper than at the store. I didn&#x27;t like it as well as what I was using before. It didn&#x27;t seem to cover as well and if I put more on to try to get better coverage, it looked cakey. I started selling Mary Kay and realized I was misinformed and they are still selling the loose powder that I love so much. Much better coverage and doesn&#x27;t look caked on.</li>
    <li> BareMinerals is an awesome product if you are actually getting BareMinerals.  This seller is selling a fake product.  I have used BareMinerals for years and years and knew immediately when I put this one that it was not BareMinerals.  It has a weird color, does not cover worth a flip, and looks smeary after a few hours.  My husband even told me I needed to go buy BareMinerals at the same store I usually get it from and when I asked why he commented &amp;#34;Because whatever that is that you are using looks horrible.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love the mineral aspect of this but be prepared it is only light coverage. It does not cover as well as some other brands.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation.  It goes on smooth and makes my skin look great.  It also has a nice &amp;#34;sifter&amp;#34; that allows you to close the powder off from the lid.  This is great if you travel because it keeps the powder from going everywhere.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> I should have read the other reviews before purchasing this products. I figured this was a &amp;#34;no brainer&amp;#34; purchase since I already knew the exact color for my skin tone. WRONG! This is not the real things. This product has an orange tint to it and does not cover at all.</li>
    <li> This has good ingredients and as a result, feels better and cleaner on the skin. Much better coverage then other loose powders I&#x27;ve tried.  Does NOT settle into fine lines like other powders.</li>
    <li> This is a good product if you have good skin! I find if I&#x27;m broke out that I don&#x27;t really feel it has enough coverage. But when my skin is clear, I love how light it feels and I love that you can just re-buff it for touch ups without having to add more product.</li>
    <li> Got it on time and it was just what I ordered. It was the perfect color and I love the coverage</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve put off buying a new jar of BareMinerals simply because of the price. Finally decided I really missed the coverage (particularly with a LOT of sun damage now showing up). I ordered the original, which has a very slight pearlly quality to it, which gives your skin the look of &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; being bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I received was clearly flat/matte and dull. As other have said, this does NOT cover, barely even at all!! Probably some brand of translucent powder with cheap powder foundation mixed in? While the real product has light coverage, it can be built-up for greater coverage, not this. It also seems to really irritate my skin-make it reddened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money buying a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; here, just use your money towards the real item at their website or from a department store.</li>
    <li> I have been using BareMinerals for years and finally decided to try to purchase it online. I wish I hadn&#x27;t. The powder I received looked like the real thing (the packaging) however, it wasn&#x27;t. It smelled like baby powder and made my face break out and feel much dryer than usual. It also didn&#x27;t cover nearly as well as what I have used before. I recently bought a replacement at my local JCPenny/Sephora and asked the esthetician about it and she said it sounded like fraud to her and she has never known BareMinerals to smell like baby powder. The replacement I bought did not smell like baby powder and my face is no longer breaking out and feeling really dry and patchy. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SUPPLIER!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Bareminerals for years now and I LOVE it.  It provides flawless coverage.  The item was the full size and was much cheaper here on Amazon than in stores.  The seller shipped very quickly and provided a money-back guarantee, although there was not even a question about keeping it.  I will buy this product again and I will be going through this seller because they were GREAT!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first to purchase since some of the recent reviews claimed it was not bareminerals but since the seller had such good reviews I went ahead with the purchase anyways. When I received the product I found it in the correct packaging and what looked like to be sealed correctly. However, upon  opening and applying it the first time it was OBVIOUSLY not bareminerals. It gives no coverage and does not apply smoothly. Just in case, my readings of the other reviews was swaying my opinion, I pulled out my last bareMinerals bottle that I purchased from the store and the difference was NIGHT and DAY! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!</li>
    <li> This is a 100% FAKE! I thought I was getting a great deal, but ended up just wasting my money. This makeup covers absolutely nothing and I took it to a real BareMinerals store and they were appalled at how terrible of a fake this was. It gives the brand a terrible name. DO NOT BUY THIS it is literally nothing like the real thing.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I found the perfect make-up for my fair skin. It is called BareMinerals. Since I don&#x27;t often get to town I usually order it on line. This make-up is light on the skin so I don&#x27;t feel caked up. It covers and evens tones easily. I would recommend it to everyone no matter what skin tone you have. I&#x27;ll use it as long as it&#x27;s on the market!</li>
    <li> This is not the same color as the real bare minerals fairly light. It is darker and I don&#x27;t know if &amp;#34;uglier&amp;#34; applies, but it is just not an attractive face color for someone used to using the real thing.  I agree with the others who say it&#x27;s a knockoff. I&#x27;m very unhappy with the product and I have been using the real stuff for years. It provides little to no coverage and sits poorly upon the skin. I thought maybe my skin had changed but then I read the other reviews and now I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and quick and easy to apply. Does not feel heavy -  does not feel like you are wearing any make-up at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 6 years ago and I&#x27;ll never use any other type of foundation. It&#x27;s very light. Not heavy or greasy at all. I really love Bare Minerals!!</li>
    <li> I have  been using this exact color for a long time.  The color of the powder in this container was not right!  For now on I go to Sephora</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and have no need to ever try anything else.  It covers skin discolorations, evens out skin tones and leaves you with a natural look.  I hate thick, obvious foundations.  This is light and natural and stays on all day.  I don&#x27;t use any of the other products with it, it works perfectly without all the other enhancing products they try to sell you on.</li>
    <li> These are the FULL size foundation. They are just like I have purchased before. I love Bare minerals and will never go back to anything else!</li>
    <li> As many others have posted on here, this product is a fake.  I have used Bare Minerals for years, and this is definitely not the real thing.  It does not provide the same amazing coverage that the real product does.  It does not stay on as long as the true Bare Minerals foundation, even when using primer and Mineral Veil.  For anyone looking to save a few bucks on Bare Minerals, this is not worth it.  Looks like I will be going back to the Bare Minerals store or another reputable company from now on.  Shame on me for not listening to other reviews.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has just about perfect, flawless skin. She loves the application and its wearability.</li>
