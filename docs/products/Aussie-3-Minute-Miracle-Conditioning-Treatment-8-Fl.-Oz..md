      <li>My wife used and the hair was wonderful.</li>
      <li>It is perfect as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>very good</li>
      <li>I loved it!</li>
      <li>excellent product, I love it!</li>
      <li>It is a great alternative if you don&#x27;t want to pay $30 for a conditioner.</li>
      <li>Just like all products from Aussie, great</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good to my hair as hair becomes smoothier and silky.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good conditioner though.</li>
      <li>Good product, good price.</li>
      <li>I really love it!</li>
      <li>Nice</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t see anything spectacular in the product.</li>
      <li>Smells great, does help with the shine a little  but is not the best product I have used.</li>
      <li>It leaves it very smooth and silky</li>
      <li>Original product!</li>
      <li>Really surprised by the great reviews.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves your hair feeling incredibly soft and it smells great too.</li>
      <li>really hope that the Aussie brand is not changing their formulas for all the 3 min miracle and that it is just the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; formula that is not as good.</li>
      <li>it was soo easy to brush my hair after using this product.</li>
      <li>Strong fragrance</li>
      <li>This product is ok, nothing special.  </li>
      <li>so it works well for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I liked too much this product.</li>
      <li>This one lets me get some volume by adding gel, but not as well as the original.</li>
      <li>It is fair enough.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ve been through all of the new Aussie 3-minute conditioner types now, and this is probably my default favorite.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly as described!</li>
      <li>Works wonders on my baby fine, straight hair.</li>
      <li>I use this on my 3 year olds fine hair that gets very tangly.</li>
      <li>I was able to rinse most of that coating out with the original Aussie 3-minute miracle, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be possible with the new types.  </li>
      <li>Makes it so shiny, smooth and really helped with the dryness.</li>
      <li>where all that were available, so I was pretty excited to see new formulas, since the others have always worked so well for my wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Good to mix with other conditioner</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and find that most conditioners leave my hair limp with the coating they leave.  </li>
      <li>Really helps.</li>
      <li>Very water.</li>
      <li>Works very well on hair.</li>
      <li>Moist is great - a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>Other conditioners (incl the Moist and Smooth versions of this Aussie kind) can be too much and just weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>Love this conditioner, it&#x27;s not so heavy</li>
      <li>still tangled easily and also was less soft.</li>
      <li>I bought two of these, used one up as quick as possible and the next one will probably go in the garbage.  </li>
      <li>But I have to admit that this was my least favorite.</li>
      <li>Another added bonus is that it was much cheaper on Amazon than in the beauty section of my local grocery store.</li>
      <li>Leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>and I have to use a ton to get the same slick, smooth effect.  </li>
      <li>Little more shine than previous uses, but it does not condition as well as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
      <li>and it makes it so much easy to rinse out my thick, coarse hair.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> Não recebi o produto no prazo determinado no hotel onde estava hospedada. e agora já retornei para o Brasil e não recebi o reembolso do produto até hoje. Muito insatisfeita....</li>
    <li> this does make your hair shiny but it is not a conditioner.[imo]</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my baby fine, straight hair. Leaves it soft and shiny. This stuff is truly a miracle.</li>
    <li> One of the best things I have ever used on my hair!!!!!!!!! Makes it so shiny, smooth and really helped with the dryness. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!!!</li>
    <li> Dont know what is the hype with this product. Please someone, if you find &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; conditioner/repair mask please let me know, cause it aint this one</li>
    <li> Strong fragrance No clear instructions on how to use it. Probably would never buy it again</li>
    <li> When he cames to me was open</li>
    <li> very good but the volume is only for several times</li>
    <li> I liked too much this product. It is perfect as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I would like recommend this product to all the people.</li>
    <li> Got 2 B guardian angel</li>
    <li> Not good to my hair at all</li>
    <li> I got the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; one since it seemed to be for finer hair. It was kinda gunky and I didn&#x27;t notice any extra shine.</li>
    <li> Does not fully coat or penetrate hair. Very water. Does nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> I loved it! It is exactly as described! I recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using Aussie 3 minuet miracle for 7 years now (3 times a week). it used to be that Deeeeeeep and moist. where all that were available, so I was pretty excited to see new formulas, since the others have always worked so well for my wavy, frizzy hair. But I have to admit that this was my least favorite. The consistency is watery (compared to other 3MM) the texture is just like every day conditioner and a little slick, it did not coat my hair well. With the previous 3MM my hair felt smoother. After using the shine my hair felt grippy, it got caught in a brush, and felt like I did not use any conditioner and I did not notice any increase in the shine.&lt;br /&gt;I really hope that the Aussie brand is not changing their formulas for all the 3 min miracle and that it is just the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; formula that is not as good.</li>
    <li> Works very well on hair. It leaves it very smooth and silky</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to my hair as hair becomes smoothier and silky.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your hair feeling incredibly soft and it smells great too. Another added bonus is that it was much cheaper on Amazon than in the beauty section of my local grocery store. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve been through all of the new Aussie 3-minute conditioner types now, and this is probably my default favorite.

    <li> Love this conditioner, it&#x27;s not so heavy so it works well for my fine hair. Other conditioners (incl the Moist and Smooth versions of this Aussie kind) can be too much and just weigh my hair down. I get compliments on my hair being shiny!</li>
    <li> This product is ok, nothing special.  I was expecting something along the lines of their 3 Minute Miracle.</li>
    <li> This is no better or worse that any other hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; products along with using this one for in between days, and it is great! It is a great alternative if you don&#x27;t want to pay $30 for a conditioner.</li>
    <li> Original product! Nice</li>
    <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see anything spectacular in the product. My hair is not shiner because of it. It&#x27;s a good conditioner though.</li>
    <li> nothing to complain...</li>
    <li> excellent product, I love it! - it was soo easy to brush my hair after using this product. I really love it!</li>
    <li> Smells great, does help with the shine a little  but is not the best product I have used.</li>
    <li> I use this on my 3 year olds fine hair that gets very tangly. Really helps. She still hates having her hair washed and getting the tangles combed out, but now that time is reduced by half!</li>
    <li> Just like all products from Aussie, great</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the deep conditioner though</li>
    <li> I bought this by accident - I usually pick up the Moist version.  This is very thin compared to the Moist and I have to use a ton to get the same slick, smooth effect.  Moist is great - a little goes a long way and it makes it so much easy to rinse out my thick, coarse hair.  I bought two of these, used one up as quick as possible and the next one will probably go in the garbage.  Really surprised by the great reviews.  Buy the Moist instead - best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, and a bargain price!</li>
