      <li>I was hoping I would love this because the price is great.</li>
      <li>Yes, this product looks great ON, but getting it off safely is the problem.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Contrary to other negative posts, I feel like it did make my lashes look better throughout the day. However, it runs like CRAZY. I can&#x27;t keep it from under my eyes and it&#x27;s hard to just wipe it off. You have to use lotion and even then it gives you a hard time.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re really into organic it isn&#x27;t the worst product. It certainly isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
    <li> same review as black organics.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting harsh chemicals on or near my eyes. I like the rubbery brush, and it&#x27;s quite easy to put on (even on the bottom lashes.) I find this mascara works best when you let it dry and then reapply a few minutes later. It&#x27;s very buildable and doesn&#x27;t clump like other mascaras would if you were to try to reapply. Also, it&#x27;s VERY affordable!  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long. I found that my dried out quite quickly. I may try this mascara again to see if perhaps it was just that tube. I hope it lasts longer next time!</li>
    <li> This mascara makes my eyelashes look amazing. It is easy to apply, has minimal clumping, and wears great throughout the day. This is now my go-to mascara to use since it is reasonably priced and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Yes, this product looks great ON, but getting it off safely is the problem.  If even the tiniest bit gets in my eyes during removal, it stings and burns for a long time.  I&#x27;ve never had that problem with another mascara, organic or synthetic!  If Physician&#x27;s Formula can work out that kink, this would be an ideal mascara.</li>
    <li> the only mascara i use to avoid getting itchy annoying bits in my eyes/contacts. love it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this mascara. I was on the hunt for a decently priced, natural mascara to give my lashes a break. I gave this mascara a sympathy star because it did a fairly nice job of defining my lashes, and it had good black color. Those are the only two  things that are decent about this mascara. Everything else is horrible. It doesn&#x27;t lengthen your lashes much past your original length at all, nor does it really thicken. It defined my eyes nicely, but was weak in the other two departments, and I thought that this was merely because it was a natural mascara without harsh ingredients holding my lashes up. Now, let me say this: I always apply eye primer underneath my eye, then apply concealer, and then dust powder on top of my concealer to set. On top of doing ALL OF THAT, this mascara smudges within half an hour!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am not talking a slight dark cast under my eyes. I mean, it smudged a dark ring beneath my eyes like I was wearing no concealer at all! I kept having to wipe my eyes insecurely all day because of this mascara. Keep in mind, that this is also winter. It smudged despite cold weather, primer, and powder. Imagine if I had worn it during summer (gasp). Ridiculous. I have worn many non-waterproof mascara formulas, and I have never experienced such bad smearing. Avoid this mascara, look for another alternative. Mine was unwearable because of this, and I had to throw it away. :(</li>
    <li> I am sharing this review, via my husbands&#x27;s account.  I wanted to go all natural/organic with my skin care, as I have with my diet.  It&#x27;s a challenge!  But I found this mascara at Wal-Mart and thought I would give it a try.  Here is why I love it! It&#x27;s cheaper than other comparable brands I looked up online, It&#x27;s conveinent because most places carry it, the labeling on the package is very clear, it tells you exactly what it is, \\&quot;free of\\&quot;. The packaging is also beautiful, (if that matters to you), but most of all I love the mascara itself! I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m sacrificing quality to have an all natural product.  Iv&#x27;e been wearing it about a week now and love how it makes my lashes look.  It&#x27;s stays on through the day, and I have had no issues with clumping.  I use olive oil to remove my eye makeup, since it&#x27;s all natural and good for your skin. (it&#x27;s cheap too, since it takes very little.)</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I don&#x27;t like the contour of the brush. It gets my kids dirty every single time. I also it somehow gets to my dark circles making them look even worse and I don&#x27;t even use it on my lower lashes. It takes longer to dry bi love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s organic but it looks like it won&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, the brush fans my lashes well. It does clump a tiny bit but that can be fixed with a clean mascara brush or brow brush. The formula is all natural which is the reason I bought it. It&#x27;s a great value for the money and my new go-to mascara.</li>
    <li> Honestly if there was any mascara in there then it might of been good. I feel like I got almost empty one. This is when I would buy a new one , but this new one is practically empty !</li>
    <li> So happy to find an organic opition for mascara. Not only is it organic which appeals to my values it is a grat product that would compare to any conventional mascara.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a decent mascara. My rating is based on the following criteria:&lt;br /&gt;Mascara Brush - Does it spread the eye lashes for an even application of mascara?&lt;br /&gt;Mascara - Is it thick and clumpy or does it apply well?&lt;br /&gt;Toxicity - Just how toxic is it?&lt;br /&gt;Quantity - How much mascara comes in the bottle?&lt;br /&gt;Convenience - How easy is the bottle/brush to hold?&lt;br /&gt;Price - Is it going to break my wallet to get a decent product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*The mascara goes on well. It is pretty smooth and doesn&#x27;t smudge. I wear it all day without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;*It is rated low on the toxicity scale. They call the mascara organic but it is not. If it was truly an organic product, it would have the USDA certified organic label. However, it is low toxic and made with many organic products.&lt;br /&gt;*This mascara only cost $9 with free PRIME shipping which was much better than paying $15 for a mascara with a better toxicity rating plus $7 shipping. I need to look up quantity for a true comparison though. This mascara has a very little tube which may account for the lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Mascara brush is okay. I had a Cover Girl brush that worked perfectly with my eye lashes. It separated every single one. This brush is just a short, fat round brush so the bristles aren&#x27;t really able to go with the shape of the eye and separate lashes. I&#x27;ve had worst brushes though so I&#x27;m rating this as an ok brush. There is definitely room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;*Quantity is little. The design of the bottle makes it appear that there is a large quantity of mascara in there but it is quite small - probably the smallest mascara tube I&#x27;ve seen. The actual product is flat with a small mascara tube inside.&lt;br /&gt;*The design of the bottle is actually quite inconvenient. The leaf shape makes it hard to hold the brush end and because the bottle is so flat, it doesn&#x27;t stand up very well so the tube part gets laid of it&#x27;s side. Not the best design.&lt;br /&gt;*Price - This is going in pros and cons because even though the price seemed decent, once I saw the size of the actual mascara bottle, I don&#x27;t think it was really the best deal.</li>
    <li> Fabulous and Cruelty FREE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy cruelty free products and found this mascara. Not only is it cruelty free but it is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. The brush is amazing and fills in eyelashes very nicely.</li>
    <li> I have read multiple reviews about how great this product is so--needing a natural mascara--I tried it out for myself. Everyone was right--this is a really fantastic product. Its large brush gives lustrous volume and has a nice clean black color. I read that it might smudge, but have yet to experience that. Perhaps, it holds so well because I condition my lashes with grapeseed oil prior to application and I combat flaky dryness by not pumping the wand, but instead twisting it. Granted, this is NOT a waterproof mascara so if you&#x27;re prone to crying or live in a very wet, humid climate--this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;  Anyway, I am very happy with this product and the price which runs about $10 in store. Most natural and organic mascaras are more expensive than that and don&#x27;t seem to live up to standers. I would advise you to get the Black color vs. Ultra black, since the black is really a dark coal color and has a tenancy to look almost bluish up close in some lightings. Given that I can imagine the Ultra black must be pretty extreme.</li>
    <li> The brush is so large it is hard to not get mascara on my lid every time</li>
    <li> Physicians formula products are among the very few organic, dermatologist recommended, and non-comedogenic makeup lines I have have found. I love their products for this reason.   This mascara applies pretty well- clump free, bold, and volumizing. Also, it doesn&#x27;t smudge much throughout the day, unless you close your eyes for more than 10 minutes. However, I have found that by mid afternoon, my eyelashes are thin and sparse looking. They are still dark, but not nearly as full or long as when I first applied the mascara.</li>
    <li> This is my first try at using a natural mascara. I&#x27;ve used Clinique mascara my whole adult life, so this is the only comparison I have.  The Physicians Formula Organic Wear mascara does not go on as smooth or as thick as the Clinique I&#x27;m used to.  But the Organic Wear mascara doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets in my eyes.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with flaking or raccoon eyes.  Because the brush is so large I have a little difficulty applying the mascara, every time I end up touching my skin and have to clean up the mistake.  This mascara easily comes off with just water.  I&#x27;ve only used it for 1 week but I&#x27;m planning on continuing to use it and I already thew all my Clinique away.  However, I really like \\&quot;Tarte Lights Camera Lashes\\&quot; mascara too.  Overall I really love this natural mascara because it works well enough and I know I&#x27;m not putting harmful chemicals near my eyes or on my skin (when I wash my face the mascara comes into contact with my skin).</li>
    <li> I really do love this mascara. It goes on well and stays on all day. It&#x27;s a great price, especially for an organic mascara, but you get what you pay for. In this case that seems to be a half empty bottle. I will probably continue to buy this mascara because it works so well, plus I can usually find it at Walgreens if I run out and need some right away. It is incredibly hard to find organic products in my area so that is actually a pretty big deal to me. I just wish I got a little more for my money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay because I wanted something that was organic, but I must remember not to rub my eyes when I&#x27;m wearing it, or it rubs off and I look like a raccoon.  It is definitely gentle on the eyelashes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of thick. It smudges sometimes and makes me look like a raccoon. I am not sure, maybe it&#x27;s living in Florida that&#x27;s making it like that, I&#x27;ll update later.</li>
    <li> This is truly wonderful mascara!  I&#x27;ve tried them all from the fancy, pricey \\&quot;cadillac\\&quot; brands such as Lancome (I really don&#x27;t like that they test on animals and use a lot of known toxic ingredients) to the hypoallergenics such as Almay to the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones such as Honeybee Gardens.  All of them either irritated my eyes and/or clumped and smeared and/or were really difficult to wash off.  Being a person who&#x27;s not only hypersensitive to what goes on my skin or eyes, and likes to keep things as simple and natural as possible, this is it!  It&#x27;s got a wonderful wand that really separates lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t irritate, doesn&#x27;t smear, washes off easily and looks natural. And the price is right.</li>
    <li> Flakes after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I always would have an issue with generic eye liner and mascara burning my eyes. This product is far superior to any generic mascara. It doesn&#x27;t run and is easy to remove!!</li>
    <li> I love that this mascara is made of natural ingredients, and it goes on just as easily as any other mascara.  It washes off easily and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with it smudging or flaking off.  I&#x27;ve bought this product twice now, and plan to again in the future, as I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara, I wanted something that was more natural and did not use all the chemicals other mascaras use.&lt;br /&gt;This one really impressed me. I was not expecting it to do so well. It stays on and does not smudge, it dries quickly after you put it on so you don&#x27;t have to worry about waiting for it to set. The thing that really impressed me the most was how nicely and easily it washes off at the end of the day. You do not have to worry about having raccoon eyes after washing this off like with other mascaras!&lt;br /&gt;the other plus is you can purchase this at local stores like walmart and CVS so it is not as hard to find like other organic mascaras :)</li>
    <li> After years of wearing mascara that damaged my lashes &amp; probably my eyes, I decided to quit using any--this after never leaving the house without mascara since my teens.  I was thrilled to find Physicians Formula Organic with good reviews and a decent price.  I didn&#x27;t expect too much from it but thought it would be better than the bare look I&#x27;d been sporting for a couple weeks.  It was such a pleasant surprise!  It goes on great without clumping.  It has a nice texture &amp; no smell. It does make the lashes look nice, &amp; with a second coat, thickens them up. I do get some smudging, but it seems to be due the moisturizers I have to apply to the very dry, damaged skin around my eyes. When I&#x27;ve skipped the moisturizer, the mascara has stayed in place without smudging.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with this brand!</li>
    <li> I liked that it is \\&quot;green\\&quot; and the brush is nice, a little big for the inside corner.  It goes on okay, but can get clumpy if you are wanted to add more coats.  As long as I don&#x27;t touch my eyes at all it stays put but if I touch them at all it smears.  I normally don&#x27;t touch my eyes often but this product burns my eyes so I have been rubbing them.</li>
    <li> My eyes get irritated very quickly and this mascara never irritates</li>
    <li> Arrived much earlier than expected. I use a different brush than the one given to apply, but the quality of the actual makeup is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I wanted go like this because it&#x27;s organic,but I can&#x27;t handle the smudging.  It&#x27;s ok for a few hours, but ends up under my eyes.  The application is fairly clumpy as well.  The only plus is that it&#x27;s less irritating to my eyes than the standard mascara.</li>
    <li> This mascara is dry and clumpy....yuck!  It is really hard to apply and it runs if your eyes water at all.  I gave it two stars for being natural and for not bothering my contacts!!</li>
    <li> Great product! The brush is a little hard for me, but the product quality is great. It washes nicely away with warm water, not exactly a waterproof product (reason why I bought it) and doesn&#x27;t leave your eyes as the ones of a raccoon. The product doesn&#x27;t clump up, it is smooth on the lashes, and leaves them feeling quite healthy without feeling leftover residues after washing is with plain warm water like other products do.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are overall healthy and environmentally friendly, which is a total thumbs up in my opinion!</li>
    <li> I should have read about the size  it is huge.  As a result I have smudged eyes and it is hard to remove even after days later.  The only thing that I liked was that it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t review products like this, but I&#x27;m so impressed that I feel obligated to do so! Let me first state that I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural mascara over the years. I&#x27;d been using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Bare Naturale for a while and lost patience with how thick and paste-like the formula was. I decided to give Physician&#x27;s Formula Jumbo Lash a shot and I have to say that this is absolutely the best natural mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried. I can actually achieve pretty dramatic lashes with this mascara -- a feat previously unattainable with natural mascara. No flaking, smearing or clumpiness whatsoever. I can wear this all day without raccoon eyes. It doesn&#x27;t weigh lashes down, nor does it have that dreaded goopy consistency that many natural mascara formulas seem to have. I also love the size and shape of the brush. Although the larger brush makes reaching corner lashes a bit challenging, I don&#x27;t find this to be a major drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great natural mascaras are few and far between, so I hope Physicians Formula continues to make this mascara. Great product.</li>
    <li> Went on well, no clumping, just like I like it. BUT...... as the day wore on, I had raccoon-ish shading under my eyes from this mascara. Bummed.... really wanted an organic mascara I would love, but this is not it. Went in the garbage after 4 tries.</li>
    <li> First of all, I wanted this mascara because it is more organic. I haven&#x27;t been using commercial mascaras for a long time but I recently became aware of all the harsh chemicals that most of them contain. I don&#x27;t like to spend much money on mascaras (under $10) so the fact that this Organic Wear mascara was a good price AND organic was enough for me to want to try it. I bought it in \\&quot;Black\\&quot; and it just kind of gives me a natural look. My eyelashes (which are naturally dark) have been weirdly separated lately so applying the mascara was not so smooth. The formula kind of had a dry texture and like I said, it only gave me a natural look even after I applied about 3 coats. I usually like my eyelashes to stand out (in a non-clumpy or exaggerated way but I like them to look fuller) so I think I will have to give the \\&quot;Ultra Black\\&quot; a try and hope that the texture is better.I think I will continue to try other natural mascaras but this one wasn&#x27;t too bad for a first try.</li>
    <li> What a great price for my fav nature-based mascara!</li>
    <li> My expectations for this product weren&#x27;t very high because it&#x27;s organic, and claims to be free of a lot (if not all) of the chemical ingredients in more popular brands. To be honest, this made me think of messy, smudgy and less effective results I&#x27;ve come to expect from certain other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; labels. My expectations were lowered even more when I saw that there was no waterproof version, since I&#x27;ve always had an issue with mascara making my eyes water. But despite these doubts, I still decided to be open minded and give it a try, since it&#x27;s supposed to be a healthier choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what did I get for my 10 some odd dollars? Simply the best mascara I ever bought. I was shocked by how well this product worked. First off, I&#x27;m kind of amazed that it&#x27;s so gentle, and not inducing tears and giving me raccoon eyes. That&#x27;s awesome. It goes on, and stays on! Then, when it&#x27;s time for bed, it washes off clean and simple with soap and water. So, no more industrial strength make-up remover. Take that, cosmetics industry! That&#x27;s a few less dollars you get to pry from my wallet. I don&#x27;t know how they did it, but this formula seems perfect.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who is all about organic!  It&#x27;s very difficult to find organic makeup in the stores so I searched on Amazon and was happy for find this for her.  I bought it and put it in her stocking for Christmas and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and makes lashes look super long and thick. Sometimes if I do not take enough off the brush when taking out the applicator I have to comb out my lashes after application. It does have the potential to clump but it is by far the best mascara I have used.</li>
    <li> What I like:&lt;br /&gt;The color&lt;br /&gt;It works&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;Organic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;Not water proof&lt;br /&gt;Can be messy if not carefully&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product a lot and would buy it again. You just have to be carefully with it and make sure the brush is crump free before putting it on your lashes. Another note you should only apply by going under and using the wand to curl up on your lashes. Applying it the other way, makes your lashes look odd. If you use it right it should work just as well as any known brands.</li>
    <li> I love this. gives you full lush lashes with only 2 coats.</li>
    <li> Great feel, not clumpy. However I have never experienced a mascara with a shorter life. Definetly won&#x27;t be repurchasing. I ma using Jordana extreme lash at the moment, and am absolutely in love with it. ( even after comparing it to Dior, Lancôme, Loreal, Maybelline, Givinchy)</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara to address my growing concern of chemicals in/near my body.  I&#x27;m happy with the ingredients and the overall look is good.  However, the applicator is VERY big and bulky and a little hard to get it on your lashes.  I&#x27;ll keep searching for something better, but this is a start.</li>
    <li> This mascara is good for use every day, it doesn&#x27;t flake off and washes off with soap and water, and has a great application brush.</li>
    <li> Most mascara irritate my eyes, but this one didn&#x27;t. It works great. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I have not purchased this product on Amazon, but I must say it is cheaper than where I purchased the mascara.  I do not use most \\&quot;main stream\\&quot; makeup products because of the harsh chemicals and parabens that are present in them.  I must say for organic mascara I found this to be the best so far.  I have tried about three other types of organic mascaras and I have found this to be the best one. Lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t wear off under your eyes like some organic mascaras will.  I have to warn you this mascara stings a lot more than traditional mascara if you accidentally get it in your eyes.  With that being said, that is the only draw back I have found. Great product for those seeking organic solutions to substitue traditionally chemical makeups.</li>
    <li> I like the green natural movement. Because makeup is made with so many chemicals and they are harmful to us in so many ways. I am trying to go all organic and natural these days. I wanted to try this and wanted it to replace my favorite mascara (orange) Lash Blast by Covergirl. I like this mascara but the thing I don&#x27;t like, is that it always leaves flakes underneath my eyes. If the flakes are not on instantly when applied, they will be there at some point sooner than later. I look like a racoon. Don&#x27;t rub your eyes at all either because the stuff just comes right off your lashes, but will stick to your skin and I turn into a raccoon. It makes my eye lashes too long and spikey and does not volumize like Lash Blast does. It does wash off easily at night with face cleaner. Just don&#x27;t like the flaking and smudges more than anything. Will have to keep looking for another all natural mascara that does what it should. Curl and volumize.</li>
    <li> I had low expectations for a natural mascara but this product is fabulous!  I would use it just for its quality alone.  It goes on great and looks better than the traditional brand mascara I have been using and I can feel good about what is in it.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> When I first bought this mascara, I didn&#x27;t realize I was going to love it so much. I was previously using Honeybee mascara, which I liked, but this Physician&#x27;s Formula Jumbo mascara does a better job (in my opinion). It gives a similar effect to putting on fake eyelashes, expect fake eyelashes can be very obvious if you don&#x27;t know how to put them on well. I&#x27;m sensitive to chemicals in mascara &amp; eyeliner, but my eyes do not feel irritated after wearing this mascara all day at work, and when I wash it off at night, my eyes don&#x27;t itch afterward. All my girl friends are getting this as part of their birthday presents this year! hahaha</li>
    <li> This organic mascara comes with a nice brush that prevents clumping.  The mascara itself really does thicken and darken up the lashes nicely.  This product can&#x27;t quite compete with some of the regular mainstream serious lash thickening mascaras, but then those icky chemical products usually make you look like you have fake lashes.  I used Aveda organic mascara for a long time, but I have switched to this formula because it works better, its less expensive, and lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I have recently been searching for some great cruelty-free makeup so I decided to try this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a really great product and so far I have had no real problems with it. :) Its a rich black color and leaves my lashes feeling soft and not brittle like most. It doesn&#x27;t smudge at all for me. (I know some say it does like crazy but I think it depends on your skin, weather, how watery your eyes are, etc)&lt;br /&gt;Large brush can be a little tricky and if you have a heavy hand it can get on your lids. But running a q-tip over the mistakes fixes them easy.&lt;br /&gt;It comes of super easy (I just used a cleansing cloth) and didn&#x27;t leave my lashes feeling weak.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like this mascara and I think it&#x27;s going to be one of my new go to&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Runs easily but looks nice</li>
    <li> It goes on fine but when I wash it off I look like I have two black eyes. It has a much waxier texture that can smear and be difficult to get off.  I was surprised that for an all natural mascara it is so hard to take off. Usually I just use hot water on a washcloth to get all of my makeup off but I had to use harsher soaps to get this off which I have never liked the idea of getting soap in my eye.</li>
    <li> I constantly have to wipe under my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras. It provides good coverage, adds volume and the no flaking throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I do love this mascara. It gives great volume and length to my average lashes and the color is a nice, deep black.  The downside is if you cry while wearing this mascara it will sting and run.  I have used many, many drugstore mascaras and while some ran I don&#x27;t recall any ever stinging. However, those other mascaras were also loaded with more chemicals and were from companies that test on animals. So all in all, the quality, performance, and especially the price point are all worth the chance of running and stinging (on the off chance you cry while wearing it).</li>
    <li> Thank order came quickly&lt;br /&gt;and this is what I need</li>
    <li> I wish the brush had a little more depth to it so that it would create longer lashes with out such thick build up.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara especially since it&#x27;s organic. It looks great on my lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump them together, and stays on great. Plus it wipes off with water super easy which is nice. My eyes are super sensitive, so I was happy that this didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like most mascaras. It did bother my eyes once but not as much as all the other mascaras I&#x27;ve used before. I definitely recommend it. Just watch out if you cry or have watery eyes since it wipes off with water so easily.</li>
    <li> I would say this is a good mascara for separating the lashes and lengthening, but not so much for extra volume. Still, it&#x27;s great to know that it&#x27;s made from natural, organic ingredients which is why I bought it. Will probably get it again.</li>
    <li> Thick but not greasy, beautiful black color, breathable, doesnt smear, dries fast, no smell and doesn&#x27;t get sticky.  I have very sensitive skin and have not had issues.  I previously loved lancome and maybelline softlash but use this now.</li>
    <li> I love it! The only think is it makes my eyes itchy. And takes forever to wash off!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch, and it&#x27;s very easy to apply, but boy does it smudge. Maybe I just pick at my eyes a lot, but I look like I&#x27;ve gotten into a fight after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.  I will say it isn&#x27;t my all time favorite, but it is a fantastic product.  I bought it because it was a natural product and I was having issues with watery eyes due to allergies and this helped a lot.  The only negative I could identify was that while working out, the mascara ran dramatically.  Although it stays put all day without smudging or flacking, when you sweat, it will run...a lot!  So, I have two mascaras:  one for workouts and one for daily use.  It is a very good product.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch or flake off. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful in using this product because it&#x27;s safe for humans and animals, however this product burns my eyes...badly. when i use it, i am careful not to get it in my eyes. shortly after putting it on, my eyes begin burning and watering.</li>
    <li> I have recently replaced all of my toxic cosmetics to non-toxic natural and organic items. However, when it came to trying to find a safe and organic mascara I was really skeptical.I have used Maybelline Great Lash Mascara for years and I was really nervous about trying a different product.&lt;br /&gt;However, this product does not disappoint! I have really long lashes and this mascara really makes them pop even more. The product doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and make my lashes hard like other mascaras. However, my lashes aren&#x27;t wet either. I read a review on this mascara that the lashes don&#x27;t ever dry. This didn&#x27;t happen to me, I can run my fingers over my lashes and no products are on my hands and at the same time they aren&#x27;t hard and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and this is now my staple mascara!</li>
    <li> I read oodles of blogs/reviews before I ordered this.  Never did I read that it would smear if you teared up or your eyelashes got damp. Boy, I found out the hard way. I put them on before meeting a friend, during our conversation my eyes tears up. When I went to the bathroom I saw I looked like a raccoon. Ugh...bummer...this is what has happened before with organic mascara.</li>
    <li> This got a good rating on EWG&#x27;s cosmetic database and after having it used it for half a year it has been the best safe/ affordable mascara option I have found (although 100% pure was good too!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is the mascara flakes after a few hours. Also it works better if you put some moisturizer on your lashes before putting it on because it can go on unevenly, especially as you use it more. It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and was a good price with pretty good ingredients.</li>
    <li> After seeing such good reviews of this product, I was really looking forward to using this product. And I want to say first, this is a decent mascara. I just didn&#x27;t find it to be noticeable when I wore it. In my opinion it is more of a beginner mascara or for someone who wants an ultra-natural look. I tried layering it several times but found that I failed to notice any thickening/lengthening benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I forwarded it on to my sister who is in high school and this works perfectly for her needs. So it&#x27;s not a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have developed allergies over the years and it affected me wearing makeup.  I tried several different brands of mascara and they all smelled like chemicals and burned my eyes.  Then, I found this brand, but as always, I was skeptical at first.  I wore it all day and into the night with no reaction whatsoever.  I continued for a month and still no reaction!  This is awesome!  I finally found a mascara that I can wear comfortably.  Please try this, you will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. I get it because they don&#x27;t test on animals. It&#x27;s less irritating than other mascaras I&#x27;ve used but it does come off with water. I wish they made a waterproof one!</li>
    <li> Smudges in 10 minutes. Wears completely off by the end of the day. Pass.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and a very true black!  Absolutely no irritation - you might as well be feeling water being brushed onto your lashes!  The formula coats the lashes fairly well and the brush is giant which makes neatly placed lashes a breeze.  It does rub off a little throughout the day, just like any other mascara (that costs less than $30!) but that is by far the only con I&#x27;ve experienced so far.  Just ordered my second tube!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have very sensitive eyes but I can wear this formula and guess what? It looks just as good as the other &amp;#34;harsh nd ingredient&amp;#34; kinds!</li>
    <li> This was okay. I had previously bought an organic mascara from Physician&#x27;s Formula that I loved so I was hoping this Jumbo Lash Organic one would be equally great. I was wrong. It was just okay. Not bad, but not really good. The regular organic one works great and makes my lashes more jumbo than this jumbo one did. I&#x27;ll be going back to the other one.</li>
    <li> This is just OK - didn&#x27;t do anything great for my lashes, not a fan of the large applicator.  I also bought a pack of 2, and when I went to open the second one, the applicator was broken so I couldn&#x27;t use it!  Still on the search of a safe mascara that actually works...</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and appears to be good for someone with allergies. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a little bit, and the first time I opened it, I felt like there was nothing in there. It only seems like there is product on the brush. Only time will tell, but I feel that the design will not be conducive to reaching product around the edges like with a tubular design. Can&#x27;t argue with their prices though. On the natural front, they are one of the most reasonable. We&#x27;ll see if they are as reasonable at first glance once I see how long it lasts though...</li>
    <li> I feel a bit disappointed about this product -- I was so happy to get it as I&#x27;m a big advocate of cruelty-free organic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as amazing as it is that this product did not harm animals and its making (and that is amazing), there is a ton of fall-out with this product. In fact, I&#x27;m going to have to throw it out and purchase another mascara because it literally makes me look like a raccoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I would love to recommend this product because of the ethos behind it -- but I&#x27;m certain that there are better cruelty-free products that aren&#x27;t so terrible.</li>
    <li> best organic mascara hands down! it&#x27;s light since I don&#x27;t like to put too much mascara anyways, and every lash is happy by it self and not stuck to each other like other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Yes, the package is cute, the brush is great, the product goes on quickly, and it really thickens your lashes.  Later in the day it will flake, but that&#x27;s not the real problem.  The real issue is when you add tears, and the product turns into black acid frying your eyeballs.  No tears need actually fall, just tear up with emotion and you&#x27;ll soon be shrieking in pain.  It&#x27;s especially exciting when it happens while driving as opening your eyes is far more painful than keeping them tightly shut (though that hurts, too).  Luckily, the liquified mascara burning your corneas can be mopped up with a tissue, restoring you to mild discomfort and relatively presentable lashes.  So if you have non-functioning tear ducts, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> arrived on time performs well on eye lashes does not leave clumps on lashes very satisfy only applied once and does not irritate true to the color</li>
    <li> applies easily and stays on all day. Nice having product w/o all the nasty chemicals in it.</li>
    <li> I find tihs mascara to be a bit clumpy and it then smears onto my face during day. I end up with black under my eyes.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This mascara clumps like crazy. I wipe as much of the mascara off of the wand before I put it on and it still clumps.</li>
    <li> Product smeared easily and did not last the whole work day, but I love the natural ingredients and the brush shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been incorporating organic products into my lifestyle for the last year. My makeup was the last on the list to make the switch.&lt;br /&gt;I was using maybelline and my eyes were red and watery on many days because of it. I didn&#x27;t think I had allergies to the mascara because it wasn&#x27;t everyday. I decided to purchase this mascara after reading the positive reviews and I absolutely love it! It goes on just like any other conventional mascara and stays on all day! At the end of the day it comes off real easily; no need to rub your eyelashes off. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara and the fact that its organic.  Love that it doesn&#x27;t smudge and flake.&lt;br /&gt;I would like for my lashes to look longer but maybe it&#x27;s just the way my lashes are.</li>
    <li> Everything this product says it doesnt do it does. It smudges and never fully dries. It runs and is oddly dry and hard to put on. The mascara doesnt last long by 2hrs I look like I have little stubs for eyelashes. It also makes my eyes tear and if it gets in my eyes it burns. Sucks because I really wanted to like this product. Thought maybe I got an old one so I bought another one in Blackest Black or something like that and still the same thing. :/</li>
    <li> I have used this 3 times since I purchased it, and so far I like it.  I have not had the same issues others have had with it never drying or smudging...mine dried and did not smudge.  I have thin, blonde lashes and this mascara makes them thicker and longer.  I gave it 4 stars because I am not sold on the brush they use...it is huge.  I have to say that it separates the lashes, which is a good thing, but the size makes it a little difficult to get to the bottom lashes...until now, I have always used maybeline mascara and am used to the smaller brush.  This will take a bit of getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I really like the mascara and will purchase it again because of its natural ingredients and the fact that it has a low rating on EWG.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara that does not smear and then irritate my eyes of all the many natural and organic ones I tried.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick like the package claims and goes on even too.  Very Nice!</li>
    <li> This has a fairly good rating on Environmental Working Group but it does not perform well. I found better fortune with Jane Iredale&#x27;s mascara, which is especially good because I found that it can be removed with emu oil.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for several days and I am sad to say this is not the organic mascara that will get me to switch. It stays wet for quite a while, which leads to smudging. Also, it seems that no matter how many layers I apply, it does not add to the length or volume of my lashes. I truly wish I had better things to say, but if you are looking for mascara that applies similar to CoverGirl LashBlast, MAC mascaras or Dior Show (all provide awesome length and volume, but aren&#x27;t organic) you will be disappointed. It&#x27;s much more subtle.</li>
    <li> The first thing I love about this is that there aren&#x27;t tons of harsh sulfates in this mascara. It is super light and goes on really clean instead of having to declump it. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes fall out or lose their natural look as other harsh mascaras do. This is my favorite mascara and it lasts a long time. Just make sure to change out your mascara every 6 months ladies! :)</li>
    <li> I have never had a reaction to mascara before and this was my first attempt at a natural mascara. All my other products are homemade or commercial products rated 0 or 1 on the EWG&#x27;s website SkinDeep. But, I was a holdout for regular mascaras. I tried this one and wasn&#x27;t wowed by the cosmetic result, then within the hour, my eyes started to itch and my eyelids started to burn. Guess I&#x27;m allergic. I&#x27;ll try another product, but this was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara because the ingredients in it aren&#x27;t tested on animals.  I only will buy cruelty free products.  This one is just ok.  There&#x27;s better ones out there tho pricier.</li>
    <li> This mascara is perfect if you want your eyelashes to look exactly like they did before you applied the product. Of all the mascaras that don&#x27;t actually give me an allergic reaction, this one is the most useless. I&#x27;m a long time fan of the brand so this was a big let down.</li>
    <li> It gives a boost but not the best in the market.</li>
    <li> I loved this mascara and would recommend it . Just be careful it is not water proof.</li>
    <li> I HAVE SENSITIVE EYE LIDS AND THIS IS ONLY MASCARA I CAN USE  EASY!!!! ON!!!!! WIPE OFF WITH JUST WATER !!!! LEAVES NO SMUDGES  EXCELLENT TO USE  PAY MORE BUT BETTER FOR EYE LIDS AND EYES</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read a break down of mascara that named this one of the most affordable products with the least carcinogenic or harmful chemicals.  Frankly, I figured it might be crap, but was work a try.  I love the super fine brush (cone shaped), and I feel like I get a great effect on my lashes.  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying organic/natural mascara and it has had pleasing results. I hate wearing makeup every day and try to skip at least two days a week to let my face rest, and also prefer a more natural look when I do wear makeup. This mascara makes me feel better about wearing it more often. My eye lashes are healthier now and they look more natural when I&#x27;m wearing this mascara. It is a little more liquidy/runny than some and goes on a little thing (but that&#x27;s what I like)!</li>
    <li> When I found this product I was looking for an all natural replacement of the &amp;#34;lashblast&amp;#34; mascara that I&#x27;ve been using for years. What I got was nothing at all like it. The mascara was very thin and left my eyelashes ridiculously clumpy. Even after several coats, my eyelashes didn&#x27;t look any longer or thicker and the clumps remained. I would not recommend this mascara to anyone! Sadly, it was a huge disappointment. Luckily, it was fairly cheap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product and also when removing from your eyes,  it doesn&#x27;t leave residue in your white towels. Other products I&#x27;ve used required me to discard because I don&#x27;t use bleach.</li>
    <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t stay on.  It smears from the moment it is applied and throughout the day, no matter how you apply it.</li>
    <li> Easy to put on doesn&#x27;t chunk up.  It does smudge off easily though.  I cant remember if it was a review or on the description that said since its chemical free it wont burn the eyes... well it still irritates mine.  So back to the cheaper brands.</li>
    <li> I tried this mascara when I began detoxing my beauty products.  Not a fan!  It looks great when you first put it on, but it flakes off throughout the day.  Lord help you if you cry or have watery eyes due to allergies - if you do this stuff burns like crazy!  I&#x27;ve since switched to Larenim for most of my cosmetics, and their mascara is superb!  Goes on smoothly, no flaking, clumping or burning.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes and this seemed to work better than normal mascara. However if I sneeze, if it&#x27;s humid out, if I sweat, or itch my eye the mascara smears everywhere.  I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara. It&#x27;s all about the brush! I do have to add a little water or vegetable glycerin if it gets dry but then it keeps going and going! I have curly lashes so I just love how this brush coats them!</li>
    <li> My wife said it is gentle on the eyes, even though it smudges and does not dry quickly.</li>
    <li> Does nothing for my lashes, except adding a bit of color. No volume or lengthening even with multiple coats. The brush is far too big for me. It makes it difficult to apply, especially on the corner lashes. Also, the odd shape of the cute leaf shaped handle makes it awkward to hold. I was hoping I would love this because the price is great. Oh well. At least I didn&#x27;t waste a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I just switched to Physicians Formula from a high end line at a specialty store and I am pleasantly surprised! I am paying about 1/4 of what I used to pay and I am 4 times happier..  Great find!!</li>
    <li> I had great hope for this mascara. The gentle formula works great and does not irritate my eyes but the brush/wand is too thick and just ends up on my upper eyelid. I have never had this happen with any mascara ever.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a start to replacing my cosmetics with something safer.  It applies smooth like my old mascara, looks great and so far no other problems with wear throughout the day.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because the mainstream mascara brand I have used for years started irritating my eyes.  I thought an organic mascara might help, and it did a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides: It&#x27;s very melty, susceptible to even the tiniest bit of moisture, which is tough in New England in a snowy winter.  Also, the packaging is a bit dramatic--the leaf-shaped bottle must be three times the size of a normal mascara tube, and the brush is more like a long mace than a brush.  Neither of those things is the end of the world, but I prefer a more typical brush, and I think anyone would prefer a smaller tube that would fit better into a makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the downsides outweigh the upsides for me, and I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Makes my lashes look great and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I really have no complaints for this.  It was exactly what I expected.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I use this mascara daily and have been buying it for the last year. It&#x27;s affordable. It&#x27;s paraben free and I like how it kinda smudges below my bottom lashes giving me an eyeliner kind of a look. Some people don&#x27;t like that, but since I don&#x27;t wear eyeliner, it&#x27;s a welcome look.</li>
    <li> I read the mixed reviews before I bought this mascara and decided to try it.  The application brush is strange, firstly.  It&#x27;s kind of like a sponge with little spiky nubs coming off of it.  The mascara itself simply would not stay put. Within a few minutes of me wearing it, it was all around my eyes.  I looked completely insane. I tried it again the next day, consciously allowing plenty of time for it to dry before.  When I looked in the mirror an hour later, the same thing had happened.  It&#x27;s funny how easily it comes off of my eyelashes and how difficult it is to get it off of the delicate skin around my eyes. I think maybe they spent too long making a really fancy package and weird sponge-y brush, not enough time making the actual mascara.  Don&#x27;t buy it!  Luckily, Amazon refunded my money very easily. The mascara I used before this is inexpensive, natural and nice.  Honeybee is the company.  It won&#x27;t give you megalashes, but it also won&#x27;t end up all over your face!</li>
    <li> The mascara felt wet for so long during the application. Then while getting dressed, I had to keep using my eyelash brush to straighten my lashes out because they were clumping together when I blinked. I went to a dinner event, only to find as I was leaving that the mascara had rubbed off all over my eyelids and under my eyes. I looked like I was made up for Halloween.  It is goopy, never dried and was an embarrassment.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love the packaging.  The mascara tube and applicator are unusually large (fat) and I found it a bit difficult to apply to the portion of the lash that is close to the eye.  I do not find this product to be lengthening at all.  It does not smear and the color was nice. I would use it in a pinch but it isn&#x27;t my first choice.</li>
    <li> I wanted to take better care of my eyelashes (and I don&#x27;t like to use makeup remover), and when other mascaras didn&#x27;t want to wash off, and stayed on through the night making my eyelashes stiff, I wanted to try something else. Originally I had a friend who raved about this stuff, and she gave me an old bottle of hers. The older bottle definitely had a different texture than the new one I just bought. It was all right, didn&#x27;t make my lashes look too spectacular, but it washed off easily and my eyelashes were stronger and healthier. The new bottle I just bought, however, is almost totally different. It makes my eyelashes longer and pop more. But it is thick and a little clumpier. This mascara ages, so try not to pump too much air into it to preserve it longer. I have to work with it a little to separate my eyelashes, but it&#x27;s worth it to make them long and dark.  EDIT a few months later:  I still use this mascara, but I realized that my eyelashes look almost the same without it on. I do have long and dark lashes, but this mascara does almost nothing to curl them.  It may be because it&#x27;s old.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find a mascara without the chemicals and junk in it.  Unfortunately, I really can&#x27;t use it as I will have black smudges under my eyes within a few hours of putting it on.  Maybe it&#x27;s not possible to find a mascara that is free of parabens, etc. but that stays on your eyelashes. :(</li>
    <li> Covers nicely,stays on, one MAJOR complaint though: it stings my eyes when I tear up even if it&#x27;s a small amount.  This may not be an issue for some, but I am a sensitive person so this is an issue for me and I may not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this and am very disappointed.  It looks great except it clumps super easily.  Likely because it dries very fast, but not a dry dry, it&#x27;s kind of a gummy type of dry which equals clumps when you put more than one or two coats (do this quickly.  And even after having this product for a couple of months and only having used it maybe 6 times, it seems like the whole bottle of product is now dried out.  I noticed just looking at the brush that there are clumps of product all over it instead of smooth liquid-like product.  I will try adding some type of oil (olive or safflower) to see if it thins out any, if not I guess I will be throwing it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the gummy-ness of the product allows you to pull the clumps off your lashes kind of easily, so that could be an option.  But i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s safe for your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again, although it does make your lashes big, it clumps and dries out way too easily.</li>
    <li> This mascara is good, and wears well. The only downside is that it makes the lashes look a little &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; and not soft and luxurious. Still, it lengthens them which is what I was hoping for. Not my first choice, probably won&#x27;t buy again, BUT will definitely use it all up. Not something that I would throw away.</li>
    <li> I have multiple chemical sensitivities and so I always try to look for natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets a really nice low rating on the skin deep cosmetics database so I was excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minute I put it on though my eyes started burning and watering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this would happen to most people, but if you are highly allergic then watch out on this mascara!</li>
    <li> The coverage is good but the brush is terrible. It causes lashes to clump together so I ended up using a different brush all together.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe this product made it past testing and review.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos for Physicians Formula attempting to make an organic product, however, it smudges and smears with just blinking.  This mascara does not stay on one&#x27;s eyelashes; it goes everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up tossing it.</li>
    <li> I could give this mascara five stars for the ingredients, but since I don&#x27;t like the formula of it for my lashes, I give it three. I don&#x27;t really care for this mascara. For a while, this is the only mascara I could use, because it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes like other mascaras did. (But I have discovered Maybelline doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes!) This mascara doesn&#x27;t really lengthen, it&#x27;s rather clumpy and \\&quot;runs off\\&quot; if sweating or in the rain. It&#x27;s \\&quot;ok\\&quot; for the price, but I don&#x27;t love it like others do. I prefer other mascaras to this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several mascaras with non-toxic ingredients, and this one is the best in terms of volume (great brush), staying power, and accessibility - you can find it at the drug store, unlike others in this category. And to top it all off, the price is a fraction of other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mascaras.</li>
    <li> The handle for the wand is a strange shape, not lending itself to efficient and convenient distribution of the mascara. Also, it is slippery. The mascara is fine, though.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive eyes, so this product works well for me. It works just as well as other mascara&#x27;s and it&#x27;s not clumpy.</li>
    <li> Worst mascara I ever purchased!  A complete waste of money.  Did nothing to my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid forties, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras.  Never have I had an experience like I had with this product.  I&#x27;ve never been sensitive or allergic to any eye product in the past, but this mascara had me running to the bathroom to wash it off midday because of the stinging sensation that I had in my eyes.  Truly bizarre.  I couldn&#x27;t even open my eyes on the way to the bathroom to wash the product off because they were stinging so badly.  After reading similar statements from other reviewers, I now realize that mine was not an isolated incident - but I wanted to leave this review as a warning to others nonetheless.  I wouldn&#x27;t want others to have the same experience that I did - it was that uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I just tried this new non toxic mascara!  I like it, but sometimes it smears!  It&#x27;s nice but I miss the toxic stuff!  I am not going to buy the toxic stuff, so this is my new  world!</li>
    <li> My husband and I share this account. I&#x27;ve had this physicians formula organic mascara for about a week and so far I really love it! I think it important to recognize what product a reviewer is coming from in order to understand the perspective. I have changed to this from Maybelline&#x27;s waterproof mascara. I used Maybelline&#x27;s for years. Recently, I decided to go with organic cosmetics. I started with the company called Lemongrass. Their products are very reasonably priced and excellently made. Before purchasing their whole line, however, I decided to research less expensive items. Most of their projects are very competitively priced. But I found Physicians Formula organic mascara less expensive by enough that it was worth trying. Unlike many of the reviewers I have not found it to be clumpy, runny or to flake off so far. It goes on nicely and if you let it dry between coats you can put on two or three coats to lengthen your lashes nicely. I even find that it does not run with slight tears or sweat. I had a good cry yesterday and of course it all came off, and it stung in doing so. But it washed completely away without the  help of soap very easily and didn&#x27;t leave me with raccoon eyes. I&#x27;m sold! I also love the applicator brush. It&#x27;s easy to use with either hand for both eye applications.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this so badly! Its packaging is adorable, and it doesn&#x27;t have any crazy chemicals in it. But if I even think of putting my hand to my eye, it smudges like crazy! One discreet dab at the eyelid and I become an instant raccoon. At least my kids like to play with the bottle...</li>
    <li> I like how this goes on -- and no reactions whatsoever -- but it seems a little light -- doesn&#x27;t go on heavy.  This is good if all you&#x27;re looking for is a light, well separated lash darkener and slight thickener but it won&#x27;t give you that heavy look.</li>
    <li> This is not &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; as there&#x27;s beeswax in it.  Cruelty free, yes.  Vegan, no.</li>
    <li> I love knowing I have an organic product going on me. Perfect for my everyday wear! Will order again! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am not sensitive and can wear any type of makeup but have been trying to switch over to all natural and organic cosmetics. I am in love with everything by Josie Maran but it is a bit expensive so I decided to give this a try. I tried it 5 times already and each time my eyes start to water and then it runs then it burns my eyes really bad. I am not sure why since it is supposed to be organic but it really doesnt work for me. I am going to try tarte I guess it is worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> To big of a brush for my taste.  The tip of the wand collects to much mascara. A real waste.  Mascara is very nice</li>
    <li> love this product and will order again!</li>
    <li> This works just as well as any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used and its not any more expensive, yet I have the peace of mind that its not made of preservatives or mistreated animals and weird plastic chemicals...win!</li>
    <li> This mascara is great if you suffer from allergies. It does leave lashes soft. However, it wipes off/smudges with just a drop of water, so don&#x27;t wear it if you tear or are going to get wet.</li>
    <li> I tried this mascara on a whim because it was less than half the price of the usual organic mascara I normally buy, but it was a huge let down. It flakes, ending up all over my face by the end of the day and after a few weeks of wearing it everyday I found that it made my eyes burn after a few hours of wear. Once I started using this mascara I noticed my eyelashes were starting to fall out at a rapid rate. If you have high eye sensitivity like myself - I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I should have gone with my instincts on this one.  I don&#x27;t know why this formula has better reviews than the other &amp;#34;Physicians Formula&amp;#34; mascara that just has the little leaf on the handle.  It is a much better mascara.  Much wetter, and a better brush.  This started flaking within an hour or two.  Horrible, just horrible.  Go with the other one, it is far superior.</li>
    <li> This mascara simply does not work. It smells bad, has poor coverage and does not last. I was excited to get a more natural makeup but that was a bad choice. Stay way!!</li>
    <li> I was VERY excited to try this mascara.  I LOVE Physician&#x27;s Formula products and use their powder, eye shadow, and bronzer religiously!  I recently made the change to all cruelty-free products in the household, so I was excited that this fell into that category and was a brand I trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the mascara just did not work for me.  It barely made a coating on my lashes, so I opted for multiple coats (about 2-3).  The mascara never dried.  It was wet and smudgy on my lashes from 730am until 415pm when I got home from work and couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off!  Even hours after application, the wet mascara would smear under my eyes when I would blink.  It was also clumpy and did not separate my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use Physician&#x27;s Formula for powder, eye shadow and bronzer, but will choose another mascara.</li>
    <li> smudges and does not stay on. I had to check my eyes often to clean up the smudges, did not like that at all</li>
    <li> This item is eco- friendly and all natural i love it,it&#x27;s save for my face and  no dangerous ingredients that could cause cancer ya</li>
    <li> Normal mascara makes my eyes burn, so i wanted to try organic mascara to see if there was a difference. I LOVE it! It goes on nice, and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes burn at all or make them itchy. The only thing is its not waterproof and can smudge easily so avoid water and crying. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it</li>
    <li> Love this! Organic and it works really well.</li>
    <li> This is a good mascara for light wear. It doesn&#x27;t provide much volume and is the kind when you have to let dry before opening your eye&#x27;s or it will smear. Also when I first got this I thought I&#x27;d like the different style brush handle but I found it slightly difficult to use. It&#x27;s good to have as a backup lying around lol.</li>
    <li> This is the first time in over 40 years of wearing makeup that I contracted a virus around my eyes, and this is the first time I went to the trouble to purchase organic mascara.  I wore it for an event on Aug 21, and that was the only time I wore it.  Ever since then, my eyes are a mess.  I&#x27;ve finally been treating them with steroids and there is some improvement.  I don&#x27;t know what the problem is with this mascara, but it surely caused a major problem for me.</li>
    <li> I try to use only organic/natural products, so I was excited to use this. All the negative reviews are right, the tube dries up fast and has a short life. The mascara smudges all over the under eye. I&#x27;d have to wipe under my eyes frequently to remove the dark circles. I&#x27;m currently going mascara-less while I search for another brand as I&#x27;m tired of &#x27;looking goth&#x27;. I like physicians formula, but encourage them to improve this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome mascara.  I stopped wearing mascara years ago because 10 mins later my eyes would water and feel heavy.... Well this item I sometimes forget I even have it on.  I was so excited to know I could actually wear mascara.  Doesn&#x27;t clump, flake,  or irritate.  I had no idea it was the harsh chemicals that normal mascara has in it so it lasts longer and such.  This cute little green mascara is a miracle wand!  Don&#x27;t wait but it try it and discover the true comfort of mascara!!</li>
    <li> I saw this brand at some healthy food blog and I remember organic mascara cool packaging. I just got it and love it. Feels great on the lashes, natural, every day look!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to transition to natural cruelty-free products, so I really wanted to like this mascara. It didn&#x27;t even look like I had any on and it never seemed to dry. It constantly smudged all around my eyes and even got in them.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Hate this product.  It irritates the eye and I have had several eye surgeries so do not like it, plus it does not make your lashes fuller.</li>
    <li> The product lasts all day, but at night comes off easily (no raccoon eye) with a washcloth and warm water.</li>
    <li> I have bought so many mascaras trying to find the perfect one. My face has been reacting to everything i use... i.e. burning and making my face burn and scar. This line of beauty products is amazing. I love them, the mascara works so well I couldn&#x27;t believe how much it costs. I like it more than my mac makeup!</li>
    <li> Better than more expensive brands that I&#x27;ve used.  My favorite mascara prior to this was Benefit They&#x27;re Real, but I got sick of paying $23 for mascara.  So I found Physicians Formula, and was delighted to see that it is partially organic, paraben free, cruelty free... and all that other good stuff that&#x27;s on the package.  So I gave it a try, and the only thing I&#x27;m unhappy with is the fact that it took me so long to find it.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product and a steal for under $10.  Easy to apply, no clumping, no smudging.  My lashes are longer and fuller, but still have a gorgeous natural look.  They also still feel soft.  This will be a staple in my beauty bag for a long time to come!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!  It really does not smudge and the extra fat brush makes for great volume with no clumping.  Comes off nice and easy too.</li>
    <li> It smudges too easily. I love that it&#x27;s more natural than other brands of mascara, but it requires more maintenence.  For example, I find myself constantly getting a wet cloth and cleaning the bottom of my eye lid, otherwise there are black smudges throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!!!! Fast shipping A+++</li>
    <li> This is an amazing mascara. Truly opens your whole eye! Hadn&#x27;t used mascara in years, but decided to give this one a go. I&#x27;m so glad i did. And specially knowing it&#x27;s organic :)</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product and the applicator brush applies the mascara very smoothly and evenly, no clumping.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara; I feel so much cleaner now that I use it. It took me some practice to get the application just right (see tip below) so that the mascara wouldn&#x27;t smudge or give me raccoon eyes (although on especially humid days, I do have to clean up slight raccoon eyes every now and then with makeup wipes (any should work, even baby wipes/wet wipes)). Other than that and having to be wary of crying in public, should the situation arise, this mascara is great. I should note, though, that I am a red head with blond eyelashes and use mascara more so my eyelashes are visible [at all], but I do use them to slightly/moderately lengthen the appearance of my eyelashes, too (I&#x27;m not a fan of wearing obviously long/fake-looking lashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;When I put on this mascara in the morning, I have an old (and completely cleaned) mascara wand (preferably a more standard mascara wand as they&#x27;re easier for &amp;#34;touching up&amp;#34; and handling). I apply the organic mascara (somewhat heavily, since I&#x27;ll be touching up), wipe off any mascara that ends up on my skin around my eyes with a makeup wipe (carefully as to not remove mascara from my eyelashes), and then trace over my eyelashes with the cleaned mascara wand (this helps separate your eyelashes, giving it a more natural look, takes out clumps, etc.). Sometimes, if needed, I&#x27;ll touch up the mid to ends of my eyelashes lightly with the organic mascara again to give it more length/definition. I hope this helps anyone who has some trouble with this mascara! I personally think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to mascara, so i took a gamble by ordering this, but it is great I don&#x27;t even know I&#x27;m wearing it! And it&#x27;s not clumpy at all! So natural looking!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very dry. Not going to buy this again</li>
    <li> I am so grateful to have found this product! I have been looking for an organic mascara for such a long time, and this one really delivers in quality as well.  If I am careful in applying it (using the side of the brush and not the tip), it doesn&#x27;t clump but does enhance the volume of my lashes which are woefully sparse.  The ingredients are natural and 70% organic; it is easy to wash off with even just water (so I will have to be careful with tears) and it looks great!  The only thing I would wish for is a brown or at least dark brown color--I&#x27;m very fair skinned so the black is too contrasting.  But for now, I&#x27;ll definitely stay with this brand.  Great thanks to Physician&#x27;s Formula!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never done a review before but I had to warn others about my experience with this mascara.  I have recently decided to try hypoallergenic mascara since I was having trouble with my eyes burning and watering at the office.  I thought changing my mascara could be the answer since my skin seems so sensitive.  When I saw this in the store, I thought it would be ideal - hypoallergenic, organic - seems like a clean choice!  The first problem was it would flake off and smear onto my brow bones and under my bottom lashes.  But the next problem is what made me actually return it to the store.  More than once, I got teary-eyed, and when I blinked, I could barely open my eyes again because they were stinging and burning so much!  I have never felt this with any other mascara.  BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new mascara. I searched far and wide for one that contains non-toxic ingredients, and this was one of the only options (unless I was willing to pay upwards of $30 for a single tube of mascara...which I wasn&#x27;t!) This mascara goes on smooth and stays all day. It washes off easily, too, which was a major complaint of my previous mascara. Overall, I am very satisfied and will definitely be purchasing physicians formula again.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara, first because it&#x27;s \\&quot;organic\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t have the feeling to damage my eyelashes wearing it, and secondly because it last all day, give my lashes a lot of volume and length and even buy wearing only this mascara on my eyes it make my eyes look much bigger. Oh and for the price there is really nothing to complain about!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t return this product because I bought it online.  Really unable to use it as it wouldn&#x27;t stay on the lashes.</li>
    <li> I really like the separation it gives and the color is good. But it really irritates my eyes for some reason. It&#x27;s fine for awhile, but at the end of the day it rubs into my eyes and stings. I got it because I wanted to use a more natural product. But I&#x27;ll just have to keep looking!</li>
    <li> Good but smears easily. Good trade off for organic and g</li>
    <li> I liked it. A great mascara. Great lengthens lashes, just gorgeous. No allergic reaction, eyes do not get tired (I our lens and it is very difficult to pick up ink, because often I had some allergic reaction). Only one problem - it&#x27;s a little greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few natural, soy based mascara and so far this is the best.  I don&#x27;t have long lashes so I need something that I can apply twice without breaking my lashes or flaking.  This mascara is dark, has lots of moisture, I can apply 2 coats without feeling heavy or clumpy.  Also, looks good with 1 coat when I&#x27;m in a hurry :)</li>
    <li> This mascara stays wet all day so if you touch it at any time you get it all over your hands &amp; if you don&#x27;t wash it off before going to bed it gets all over the pillowcase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I don&#x27;t have tons of mascara experience.  I didn&#x27;t start wearing makeup until a couple years ago, but with my sensitive skin and just personal morals, I really wanted a natural product.  This goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clump.  It dries fairly quickly.  It is not waterproof at all and if I get fairly sweaty or it&#x27;s raining, I look like a raccoon.  This is easily solved by carrying around a cotton swab and just doing a quick wipe under the eye.  Since it&#x27;s non-irritating, I haven&#x27;t rubbed my eyes with this on (haven&#x27;t needed to!) but I imagine it would probably smudge a bit.  These are things I don&#x27;t care about in a product, but they may affect your purchase.  I want my lashes to look nice and long and even, and I want the product to last most of the day.  It does that.  I don&#x27;t see this as a day &amp; night wear, and I would reapply if you wanted it to last all day AND all night.  I&#x27;m satisfied with this mascara and don&#x27;t plan on trying to find something better because this works great for me.</li>
    <li> Terrible Mascara... What&#x27;s the point to be 100% Natural if this is the worst mascara ever?!? It&#x27;s hard to apply as it clumps and leaves a terrible raccoon eyes in under an hour!</li>
    <li> I have eczema issues with eyes and skin. I had to go to a wedding and this make up did not irritate skin or make my eyes itch!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for great product and delivery of product was very prompt</li>
    <li> I use this mascara because it was not tested on animals.  I think the quality of all Physician Formula cosmetics is superior.  This mascara is probably not as &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; so it takes a second application to get the maximum effect.  It has never bothered my eyes or caused any kind of reaction.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tad smudgy and hard to remove but I love it for daily wear. Goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t clump, and doesn&#x27;t smudge half way through the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Asian girl with hooded eyes and the typical short, sparse, and stick-straight eyelashes.  In a mascara I look for a formula that doesn&#x27;t smudge and keeps my lashes curled.  Here are my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-natural ingredients, a HUGE plus for me&lt;br /&gt;-keeps my eyelashes relatively curled all day&lt;br /&gt;-washes off easily with soap and water/makeup remover&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-smudges&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t create thick dramatic lashes (compared to other volumizing mascaras I&#x27;ve tried)&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this as an everyday mascara mainly because I have sensitive eyes and using natural products is really important to me.  For the smudging problem, a reviewer here said something about keeping the under eye area dry so I&#x27;m going to swipe some translucent powder right underneath my eyes to help prevent any color transfer.  But if I know I&#x27;ll be going out after work or if I&#x27;m going out with friends on a saturday night, I&#x27;ll be using a waterproof Covergirl mascara, which I&#x27;ve found to have tremendous staying power.  And for those of you with stick-straight eyelashes, try Covergirl Lashblast Volume or Covergirl Lashexact, both in waterproof (they will keep your lashes curled!).  Hope this helped!</li>
    <li> Prior to this, I had to use two lash damaging mascaras; a regular one and then a coat of \\&quot;false lash\\&quot; mascara.  With this product,  I get amazing results with just one product, although I do use two coats. My lashes look bigger and longer, without having to get lash extensions.  The only difference I notice is after sleeping with it, it had come off by morning. Its not a problem but I imagine this mascara would need reapplying after 10-12 hours or if you rub your eyes.  its worth going natural. I will now explore the rest of their line...</li>
    <li> So, I don&#x27;t actually have this featured mascara, but I do have this brand&#x27;s pink bottled mascara for \\&quot;false look\\&quot; lashes. It is amazing. I kinda hope my current bottle runs out soon, b/c I am not scared to try their other Mascaras. I think my absolute favorite thing about it is that I wear my make up all day, clean my face with a run of the mill face wash and dry on a white towel with no marks! And no raccoon eyes that need a Qtip to get all the residual mascara off.</li>
    <li> I love the brush on this mascara. It really separates my lashes out and makes them look very natural, yet defined. The bottle&#x27;s design is quite sexy, which is just an added bonus. My son is allergic to BHT and many of the other synthetic ingredients that are in most mascaras, and a lot of other household and body products. I can use this more-natural mascara without worrying about him having an allergic reaction. I am so grateful for that!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Eco&amp;#34; ingredients which are great. But, after a few weeks of use, it started flaking.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after all of a sudden breaking out from the mascara I have been using for years.I have never been one to spend a lot of money on my mascara so I thought this would be the perfect answer to my suddenly puffy, swollen, itchy eyes. It did not break me out so I was very pleased with that but that is about it. The mascara gave my eyelashes no volume or length at all. I have also never been one to purchase waterproof mascara but oh my, with this brand I think everyone needs to. My mascara would run all the time. If my eyes watered in the wind I would have mascara on my eyelid and under my eyes. I sat in the hot tub with my head above the water the whole time...yep, black eyes all over after 15 minutes. It looks like I will have to continue looking for a low price hypoallergenic mascara.</li>
    <li> Most of my cosmetics that I use are free from harmful ingredients (however I have not been able to find a good liquid liner or eyeshadow, any suggestions?). However that&#x27;s not the only reason I use this mascara. It adds great volume and length. Some of the reviewers say it doesn&#x27;t, or there&#x27;s some other reason it doesn&#x27;t turn out the way they like it. I think technique of application have a lot to do with how any mascara turns out. It also takes practice with a new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My technique for perfect lashes is first: Curl my lashes. I blow dry my lash curler (one with lots of cushion!) on high heat for about 5-10 seconds. If it feels to hot on my skin, I let it cool for a few seconds. Then I place the curler at the halfway point on my lashes, gently squeeze for about 8 seconds, and slightly tilt the curler up towards my eye (don&#x27;t pull!). When I apply the mascara, I start at the center and at the base of the lashes and work my way to the outer corner then return to the inner eye part. This next part makes all the difference of how the mascara looks: Instead of dragging the brush through your lashes, lightly blink on the brush as you just slightly move the brush in an upward direction. This avoids clumps, and having your lashes clump together weirdly, and helps to shape the curl in your lashes. If I just dragged the brush through my eyelashes they would look like the average person&#x27;s clumped up blah lashes. I suggest all the bad reviewers try this or different techniques for applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use another mascara as long as they keep making this</li>
    <li> Good product for price. There are better options out there. Works as expected but has no wow factor. Buy if looking for a simple, cheap, works-fine mascara. Meh is the word that describes this.</li>
    <li> Great organic mascara! It smells like NOTHING, compared to other synthetic mascaras that smell like chemicals. Makes eyelashes appear darker, thicker, and longer!</li>
    <li> The brush takes a little getting used to, but I am really happy with this.  It is nothing fancy, but if you are looking for a somewhat eco-friendly mascara on a budget, this is perfect.</li>
