### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>This would not be a lotion a man would want to use, but for a woman it&#x27;s like a perfume and great lotion in one!</li>
      <li>So glad I found it!!!</li>
      <li>and I’m amazed how good it works!  </li>
      <li>All in all, though, it works great at soothing and softening extra-rough skin.</li>
      <li>This smells great, may be too girly for guys.</li>
      <li>I carry it in my purse and its great for on the go.</li>
      <li>This is great to use when you self tan.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>This product has a very nice scent.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply all over, and perfect to use at night or after the shower.</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>Price point is good, too.  </li>
      <li>Product is great for moisturizer but very strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>For the most part, I thought this was a very good product that I will surely be using again and again!</li>
      <li>It absorbs so quickly and smells SO good!!!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>While it does moisturize and leave your skin feeling nice, the smell of it cancels out any good things about it.</li>
      <li>For hands it is wonderful and I use it right before I retire for the night.  </li>
      <li>My hands are also softer and feel nice &amp; moisturized.  </li>
      <li>This lotion rubs in nicely.</li>
      <li>Yes I could have given it three stars to be more &#x27;fair&#x27; but</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Vaseline skin care products, and I really loved this one.</li>
      <li>She prescribed another OTC cream which was good, but this healing serum is better.</li>
      <li>I liked it</li>
      <li>It has a nice creamy texture almost like a cream instead of lotion.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>This product is a nice addition to your choice of moistures.</li>
      <li>it because I felt the fragrance was very strong if you apply a lot of it.  </li>
      <li>This product is by far the best purchase Ive ever made.</li>
      <li>The moisturizing properties are great too, very high quality stuff.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure as all the washing I had to do to get rid of the smell eliminated any moisture in my skin.</li>
      <li>The scent is okay...</li>
      <li>However, it is more like a lotion rather than &amp;#34;serum.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>but I could still like it better without the smell.</li>
      <li>Refreshing?  </li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>but I was able to sleep.</li>
      <li>Therefore I wasn&#x27;t able to see what they are trying to scent this product with, but it just smells like plastic on your skin.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel more elastic.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Most every one I try.</li>
      <li>but I really love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>I have read many of the reviews and can&#x27;t understand why this product is being destroyed.  </li>
      <li>: Works better than oils and lotions because the Vaseline locks the moisture in as a protective layer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This serum may be more pleasing if it were unscented.  </li>
      <li>love the flip cap top that stand up on my counter to make the product easy to dispense.</li>
      <li>It does a pretty good job with the softening</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always dubious about claims of great performance when it comes to lotions and potions, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that after using this serum my skin did look and felt better.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth and light.</li>
      <li>Lovely scent and smooth texture.</li>
      <li>Love this item - rich without being greasy.</li>
      <li>My mom thinks the smell is strong</li>
      <li>Although the scent is a bit strong, I’m not bothered by it at all.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong hospital like smell and is almost gone.</li>
      <li>but the fragrance is a bit strong and to me it smells like a lavender/vanilla mix.</li>
      <li>It does have a strong, perfume like smell</li>
      <li>This moisturizers fine.  </li>
      <li>Shame is, I am happy with how it feels on my dry patches of skin out here where humid means more than 33%.</li>
      <li>This is a better cream than ones that cost 4 times as much ! !</li>
      <li>Can be used during the day since it is light even though it is moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Just please, give me a scent free</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be happier if it did not contain a petroleum product, but I cannot argue with the fantastic results.</li>
      <li>The Vaseline jelly in the lotion makes my skin feel smooth as soon as I apply the lotion.</li>
      <li>and it makes your skin feel silky smooth</li>
      <li>After that is gone, I will check to see if this is available in an unscented version.</li>
      <li>It has three unique ingredients: PPAR activators, elastomers and micro-droplets of Vaseline jelly</li>
      <li>This is great for people with dry hands.</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice the smell much, but as time wore on the smell of the lotion started bothering me more and more.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is okay and disappears pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;micro-droplets&amp;#34; of Vaseline jelly spread more smoothly and absorb more quickly than most other creams and lotions.</li>
      <li>I love Vaseline lotion in general, and this specific product--Intensive Care Advanced Relief--is great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great product, but the scent it a little strong.</li>
      <li>The smell is pretty strong though.</li>
      <li>When using it on my feet, not only did the skin look better, but the day after using it it still looked better and some of the calluses were easier to remove than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Humidity helps to keep your skin hydrated more than you realize, so even though we complain about the mugginess in some parts of the country, be thankful if you live in a place like that.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is so strong and really does smell like a baby/senior citizen hybrid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like the scent too ! !  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hands feeling nice and smooth, without the sticky feeling and dry feeling.</li>
      <li>Amazing smells and tons of lasting moisture☆☆☆</li>
      <li>He told me his hands feel better after using it, and it appears to be effectively working on the dry spots on his hands, particularly his knuckles.</li>
      <li>It is not at all greasy when applied to the skin;  it is immediately absorbed and leaves an invisible powdery</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfumey but it also has a fresh out of the shower hint to it.</li>
      <li>If you need a product that immediately penetrates your skin, retains moisture and makes your skin feel smooth instantly, you will love this one.</li>
      <li>Still, my sensitive skin had no problem with this moisturizer at all; it was very soothing and effective.</li>
      <li>It comes in a nice squeezable container, and is just the right size for holding, not too big.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It does an excellent job moisturizing and improving the appearance of very dry and flaky skin, and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It will heal cracks in no time and is good for snakeskin due to dryness.  </li>
      <li>So the company is on the right track.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>I put it on right after a shower</li>
      <li>It is very soothing and cool as you apply it.  </li>
      <li>fact of the matter is that I&#x27;d rather spend $10 on the overly priced Nivea Smooth Sensation (it actually soaks in) than to use this lotion that I received for FREE.</li>
      <li>Very much so.  </li>
      <li>I expected amazing results from this product after reading the product description.</li>
      <li>I use it when I&#x27;m home alone, after doing housework so it doesn&#x27;t put anybody off - &#x27;cause it does work pretty well.</li>
      <li>first applied this serum brings a cooling sensation to your skin.  </li>
      <li>After several more applications it improved the look of my skin as well.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for inventing something that works!</li>
      <li>He indicated his sisters, who share similar skin issues, would LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I know there are several comments about the smell, but I love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is supposed to be a &#x27;healing serum&#x27; but it doesn&#x27;t really say just WHAT it&#x27;s supposed to heal. I fail to see how anyone can test it if they don&#x27;t know what to test it on. They say it&#x27;s for dry skin but I&#x27;ve never even really figured out what &amp;#34;dry skin&amp;#34; even means. Perhaps this product just isn&#x27;t for me (but Amazon vine requires a review, so here it is. Yes I could have given it three stars to be more &#x27;fair&#x27; but again, my issue with the complete vagueness of what it&#x27;s supposed to do far outweighs it)</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! Amazing smells and tons of lasting moisture☆☆☆</li>
    <li> I must say I was overly surprised by this. I work in a doctors office and I am constantly washing my hands, therefore drying them out. I love vaseline lotion and the one I usually always have by my desk and use after washing my hands tends to leave my hands with a sticky feeling. This does not do that. This smells great, may be too girly for guys. It leaves my hands feeling nice and smooth, without the sticky feeling and dry feeling. It has a nice creamy texture almost like a cream instead of lotion. A little goes a long way, which is even better. I carry it in my purse and its great for on the go. It lasts for a while, i went on a trip this past weekend and while i was in the mall I went to the bathroom, washed my hands and used this lotion. Noticed I never worried about my hands the entire time we were in the mall and even after we left, it lasted the whole time. Never had dry spots, never had dry feeling, sticky feeling, greasy feeling, its great. Just remember a little does go a long way! This is great for people with dry hands. I even notice that in between washes my hands aren&#x27;t as dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m probably the only one who likes the scent of this lotion.  Unfortunately, I have ultra sensitive skin that tolerates very few products, and this serum isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
    <li> I hate lotions.... Most every one I try. But this is different. It absorbs so quickly and smells SO good!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always dubious about claims of great performance when it comes to lotions and potions, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that after using this serum my skin did look and felt better. I have noticed over the years that most hand lotions within an hour or less of putting it on you see the same flaky, dry skin. I did not notice that with this lotion. When using it on my feet, not only did the skin look better, but the day after using it it still looked better and some of the calluses were easier to remove than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the 4 stars instead of 5. I don&#x27;t like the smell of this item. Reminds me of men&#x27;s aftershave.</li>
    <li> I’ve used this product on my hands and feet for a week and I’m amazed how good it works!  I live in the desert and have for ten and a half years.  During that time, I’ve tried about every lotion product on the market in hopes of healing the cracks in my feet and hands.  When you move to the desert, you soon discover what the dryness does to your skin.  It isn’t pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And not only that but cracks can be very painful.  Humidity helps to keep your skin hydrated more than you realize, so even though we complain about the mugginess in some parts of the country, be thankful if you live in a place like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my hands in water a lot around the house too because it seems I’m always cleaning up something.  The ends of my fingers would crack and peel in a disgusting way.  I actually have decent looking hands again and I’ve only used the product a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cracks on my big toes and heels are all gone as well.  I’m in shock because I never thought I’d find anything that works as well as this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When first applied this serum brings a cooling sensation to your skin.  It smells like peppermint to me and is very soothing.  Although the scent is a bit strong, I’m not bothered by it at all.  Some people sensitive to fragrances may be, but if I were, I’d use this anyway because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, I highly recommend this.  It will heal cracks in no time and is good for snakeskin due to dryness.  I’m completely sold and can see using this for the rest of my life.  Thank you so much for inventing something that works!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I work in a production facility where we produce food-grade plastics and tins. I am constantly washing my hands and using hand sanitizer, therefore my hands are insanely dry and even painful at times. I have tried pricey hand creams, countless body butters and oils, you name it. This product is by far the best purchase Ive ever made. I absolutely love this stuff. It heals and moisturizes my skin almost instantly. It does have a strong, perfume like smell but I really love the fragrance. It&#x27;s perfumey but it also has a fresh out of the shower hint to it. It also leaves my skin a bit greasy, but after I work it in for a few minutes it is gone. I highly recommended this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this item - rich without being greasy. Price point is good, too.  I used it on elbows, heels and legs.  Can be used during the day since it is light even though it is moisturizing.  I would buy this item and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This serum is not bad, but a bit heavy for me.  The fragrance is okay and disappears pretty quickly. I guess I just do not need anything quite so heavy because I just did not like it for all over use.  For hands it is wonderful and I use it right before I retire for the night.  If I happen to use my cell it has a tendency to leave a slight film on the item, so to me its a bit greasy after applying it to the skin.  I probably will not purchase.</li>
    <li> I know there are several comments about the smell, but I love it. This would not be a lotion a man would want to use, but for a woman it&#x27;s like a perfume and great lotion in one! The scent if sort of floral, I really like it and I&#x27;m picky about perfumes. The moisturizing properties are great too, very high quality stuff. Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> Definitely one of my top 3 lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. During the winter I have really dry skin and the heels of my feet begin to crack. After spending about 20 minutes at Walmart trying to find a repairing lotion I came across this one. So glad I found it!!! My mom thinks the smell is strong but I love it. I put it on right after a shower and I find it very calming not to mention my feet and elbows are smooth and no longer cracked or rough. Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say anything negative about this product, other than it would be nice if it didn&#x27;t contain quite so many chemicals. All in all, though, it works great at soothing and softening extra-rough skin. We&#x27;re just getting out of wintertime here, and this moisturizer goes to work immediately on taming the wild, weathered, winter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is white in color, in a pearlized plastic tube. It has a subtle smell that I found pleasant. The consistency is really like creamy lotion, even though the packaging mentions &amp;#34;micro-droplets of Vaseline jelly.&amp;#34; The ingredients are listed on a peel-away label on the back but are so faint you can barely read them. I checked them to see if it contained fragrance (yes) and alcohol (yes), which tend to be no-nos for sensitive skin. Still, my sensitive skin had no problem with this moisturizer at all; it was very soothing and effective.</li>
    <li> I have read problems with dry skin patches, and this really helps between the times when I am using a prescription cream. This lotions goes into the skin quickly leaving it feeling soft. There is a slight greasy or slick feeling on the fingertips right at first, but this does not last long with me. The label says there are droplets of Vaseline jelly in the lotion, but it does not feel as greasy as Vaseline. The label states that the product is &amp;#34;healing and calming&amp;#34; and I agree. When my hands or wrists or elbows are really itchy, this calms the urge to scratch and soothes the burning feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this had a strong smell of flowers that calms down after a few minutes. My husband said it smelled like citrus fruit - lemon - and the ingredient list does state lemon/lime scent. Overall, the scent it nice, but you would not want to use this at the same time that you are wearing a fragrance because it would be too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product, but the scent it a little strong.</li>
    <li> This product has a very nice scent. The scent reminds me of something from my childhood. It goes on very smooth and light. It soaks in quickly so that I can move on to my next project without waiting too long or trying to wash just the palms of my hands. I have skin that peals and cracks easily, especially when cleaning or using chemicals and this has worked wonders on healing them and even from becoming damaged.</li>
    <li> I love Vaseline lotion in general, and this specific product--Intensive Care Advanced Relief--is great. The Vaseline jelly in the lotion makes my skin feel smooth as soon as I apply the lotion.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, especially on my hands, so this product got a real workout. It does a pretty good job with the softening so I can recommend it&#x27;s effects. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s also got an overpowering smell like an old lady whose overdone the cologne. I use it when I&#x27;m home alone, after doing housework so it doesn&#x27;t put anybody off - &#x27;cause it does work pretty well. But the Vaseline people really need to do something about the scent.</li>
    <li> I would rate this lotion as 2 stars, but I received it as gratis from work so it gets that extra star. The lotion is slick, at first, but as it began to dry ON my skin, not INTO my skin, it became a rubbery residue (possibly lotion mixed with dry skin? GROSS). I had to wipe off the little balls of this over-perfumed residue with a towel. What I was left with was pretty moisturized, yet extremely fragrant, skin; the mess of lotion was definitely not worth the moisturization factor. The scent is so strong and really does smell like a baby/senior citizen hybrid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact of the matter is that I&#x27;d rather spend $10 on the overly priced Nivea Smooth Sensation (it actually soaks in) than to use this lotion that I received for FREE.</li>
    <li> Good but doesn&#x27;t seem much different than the regular lotion.</li>
    <li> This moisturizers fine.  A little on the greasy side, but sinks in pretty quick. And lasts a long time. The smell is pretty strong though. If they could do a formula in un-scented I would buy this again. But with such a strong smell it clashes with anything else scented you wear, so I would skip perfume.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent and smooth texture. Easy to apply all over, and perfect to use at night or after the shower. Skin feels soft and moisturized after application. However, it is more like a lotion rather than &amp;#34;serum.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I used to buy Vaseline Deep Moisture Creamy Formula, which is unscented, but that&#x27;s no longer available in chain drugstores.  I tried this instead. I should have smelled it before I left the store-- it has a heavy, old-lady perfume smell. I&#x27;ve washed my hands THREE TIMES since first using this, and the horrible smell lingers. It should come with a warning label.  Really, don&#x27;t the people who come up with this stuff have noses?</li>
    <li> A little too much perfume in lotion. Product is great for moisturizer but very strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> My hands are severely dry and cracked in the winter months, so I&#x27;ve tried every brand on the market. My go-to lotions are usually Curel Intensive Healing and Neutrogena Norwegian formula (both of which I would highly recommend) Now I would recommend this Vaseline Intensive Care Healing Serum too. Unfortunately, I started using it as spring was approaching, so I couldn&#x27;t really test it on my rough winter skin. However, my feet and heels are extremely dry, and after one day of using this, I noticed a huge improvement. My hands are also softer and feel nice &amp; moisturized.  Some lotions can be very sticky and don&#x27;t absorb into the skin, but I did not have a problem with this. This lotion rubs in nicely. The scent is okay... I&#x27;ve smelled better, and I&#x27;ve smelled worse. I also had a small cut on my hand and was surprised that it didn&#x27;t burn (in the winter, some lotions set my cracked hands on fire!) For the most part, I thought this was a very good product that I will surely be using again and again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Vaseline skin care products, and I really loved this one. The fragrance is just absolutely heavenly and smells like flowers. If you need a product that immediately penetrates your skin, retains moisture and makes your skin feel smooth instantly, you will love this one. It works all over your body, and I found it worked really well on my hands, which is my biggest problem since I wash them a lot, and they get really dry. If you need something that is concentrated, this is your product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I expected amazing results from this product after reading the product description. The serum did make my skin softer overall but not much softer than a nice thick body butter.  I tried using the product on two different occasions. The first time, I used after shaving and my skin burned a little after applying the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, within two hours I noticed that my skin was noticeably softer and my hands were very soft. However, the smell was overpowering  and I was reluctant to try using the serum again.  I waited a few days and then applied the serum in the evening.  Again, I found the smell intense.  It took some time for the smell to fade.  I would not apply this serum before going to work or to a social function as the scent is too off-putting.  This serum may be more pleasing if it were unscented.  I will continue to use body butter for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is considered a serum -it is thick and creamy like a lotion while skincare serums I&#x27;ve tried are thin, very concentrated, and absorb very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This is a typical texture for a moisturizer. Not sure why vaseline calls this a serum except to sound fancy as it is not what you&#x27;d expect from a product called &amp;#34;serum &amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed immediately is that this is an intensely perfumed product. Really cloying and long lasting. I could smell it hours later.  One of the most heavily fragrances products I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I noted is that it doesn&#x27;t absorb well. It leaves my skin feeling tacky. About half an hour after applying I had to wash my hands due to the ongoing stickiness and the pungent scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, for something that claims to contain vaseline it isn&#x27;t especially moisturizing. No better or worse than my usual moisturizer (Burt&#x27;s Bees).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this 3 times and liked it less each time. I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> Written by my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a dermatologist for very dry skin problems.  She prescribed another OTC cream which was good, but this healing serum is better. It is very soothing and cool as you apply it.  Also, it penetrates immediately without a lot of rubbing and does not leave a sticky, slippery film on the skin.  It lasts. I have been using plain Vaseline as a lip balm for years - Vaseline works. My one suggestion for improvement would be to make a no-scent version, or offer other fragrances.  This scent is on the feminine side.  Men could benefit from this product as well.</li>
    <li> This is a cream made by Vaseline that has really helped my extremely dry &amp; cracked skin, especially on my hands. I really like the scent too ! !  I have been using this cream for several weeks now and can see and feel a real difference in my skin. I use it sparingly, as it goes on with great coverage and it will last a long time for me. This is a better cream than ones that cost 4 times as much ! ! I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I really see no difference in this than the regular Intensive Care lotion, and feel the company is simply out to make a big buck using an old formula with a new name and package. I give this three stars and a thumbs down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees and try to avoid lotions that contain artificial ingredients but this winter my hands got so dry and cracked that I gave in and decided to try this new lotion from Vaseline. And it works. Really well. As soon as I applied this to my hands it improved the feel of my skin. After several more applications it improved the look of my skin as well. After one day of using this product, mu skin looks and feels better than it has for several years. I&#x27;d be happier if it did not contain a petroleum product, but I cannot argue with the fantastic results.</li>
    <li> This body care product is a serum instead of a lotion and it has &amp;#34;10x the healing power to reverse past skin damage&amp;#34; per the manufacturer. It has three unique ingredients: PPAR activators, elastomers and micro-droplets of Vaseline jelly and it makes your skin feel silky smooth but the fragrance is a bit strong and to me it smells like a lavender/vanilla mix. I liked it but I think men might not so beware.&lt;br /&gt;I love the flip cap top that stand up on my counter to make the product easy to dispense.</li>
    <li> This product is a nice addition to your choice of moistures. During the winter my hands, ankles and feet will actually crack! Using body oils, special lotions for dry skin have failed to do anything. My skin tends to absorb the oils but fails to keep the surface moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works better than oils and lotions because the Vaseline locks the moisture in as a protective layer.&lt;br /&gt;  Doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy&lt;br /&gt;Con: Bottle doesn&#x27;t list a &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, but the scent that comes with the product smells like a lavender with  plastic. My bottled  did not show any ingredients. Therefore I wasn&#x27;t able to see what they are trying to scent this product with, but it just smells like plastic on your skin.</li>
    <li> First, the positive aspects of Vaseline Intensive Healing Serum, Advance Relief:&lt;br /&gt;1. It works well. I have extremely dry skin that actually itches and then hurts it is so dry. I put the serum on my arms and they feel soothed and actually shine some. In the past I have been so desparate that I rubbed Vaseline itself on my skin at night and slept that way. It made a mess of my clothes but I was able to sleep. So the company is on the right track.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is not greasy or messy and has an attractive plastic container that lets gravity help with the last few drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the negative aspect of this product: It has a very strong odor. To me it is like when you step into an elevator and a woman steps directly in front of you wearing an overpowering floral scented perfume. It is unpleasant and you can hardly wait until the elevator door opens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My skin is so bad that I keep lotion in the living room, bedroom and in here in our office. On my desk is dry skin lotion that was recommended by my dermatologist.  It has a strong hospital like smell and is almost gone. I will place this lotion on my desk to take up where the hospital like smelling lotion left off.  After that is gone, I will check to see if this is available in an unscented version.</li>
    <li> I had been curious about this product line so I tried it when Target set out a sample tube. Oh, are people not kidding about how bad it smells and how it doesn&#x27;t stop stinking. It took four handwashings, two wet wipes, and a shower to get rid of it.  With all the white space on the front and back labels, you&#x27;d think they could at least mention the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.  Maybe it&#x27;s so heavily perfumed to cover up the petroleum jelly smell but I pick a mild whiff of that vs. this odor that wavers between old lady perfume and bug spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if the smell doesn&#x27;t kill you, the hydration is serviceable. I can&#x27;t say for sure as all the washing I had to do to get rid of the smell eliminated any moisture in my skin.</li>
    <li> This has to be the stinkiest lotion I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  At first I thought that while it didn&#x27;t smell good, it didn&#x27;t smell bad, either.  I put it on my arms, shoulders, and legs yesterday morning.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice the smell much, but as time wore on the smell of the lotion started bothering me more and more.  Eventually it started making me nauseous, and I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore.  So I took another shower that night because there&#x27;s no way I want to get that smell on my sheets.  While it does moisturize and leave your skin feeling nice, the smell of it cancels out any good things about it.</li>
    <li> There were thick boards of bubble gum and floral meant to mask the heavy residue of chain smokers in their cars. Forty years later, Vaseline exhumes this cloying silly sweet assault in this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes no sense to corrupt this otherwise fine product with Kool-Aid. It makes me wonder what the pure serum smells like. I cannot but point out that serum has no meaning I know of that should attach to this product. The ugly conclusion is that the word serum is also corrupted to pretend that it is medicinal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always trusted Vaseline. This verges on creepy, but falls more flatly into hocum. Shame is, I am happy with how it feels on my dry patches of skin out here where humid means more than 33%. The &amp;#34;micro-droplets&amp;#34; of Vaseline jelly spread more smoothly and absorb more quickly than most other creams and lotions. It makes my skin feel more elastic. Just please, give me a scent free version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JUNE 8, 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, this is the lotion I keep reaching for to moisturizer my hands and feet. At the end of the day I apply to my dry feet and only then realize that they hurt and now feel flexible and relieved. I humbly increase my rating because I do like it and will be getting more. I think the smell is suppose to remind one of baby powder but I could still like it better without the smell.</li>
    <li> This is great to use when you self tan. I hate the way my sheets and blankets smell after I use my self tanning cream at night. This product works in 2 ways; it keeps my legs from drying out (because self tanners have a tendency to do that) and the scent covers up the gross smelling self tanning scent. I just apply my self tanner. Do other stuff (brush teeth, wash face, etc) then apply this lotion. I see where a number of people have complained about the scent being too strong. In my case, the scent works in my favor. I hope they never stop making this.</li>
    <li> This white lotion is a bit on the thick side.  It is not at all greasy when applied to the skin;  it is immediately absorbed and leaves an invisible powdery texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job moisturizing and improving the appearance of very dry and flaky skin, and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a fragrance that starts out subtle, sweet, and fruity, but it quickly changes to an unpleasant artificial floral scent like cheap perfume that lingers for hours.  When I apply this lotion to my forearm and then sniff it a half hour later, it immediately irritates my sinuses, triggers sneezing, and makes my eyes water.  I can&#x27;t use it on my upper body because it gives me a headache.  I have been using this on my feet and lower legs and then washing my hands immediately after application only because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last few bottles of Vaseline lotion that I have used had a pleasant fragrance, especially the one with cocoa butter, so this was a big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  water, glycerin, dimethicone, isopropyl myristate, hydroxystearic acid, sodium hydroxypropyl starch phosphate, petrolatum, tapioca starch, glyceryl hydroxystearate, citrus limon peel powder, citrus aurantifolia peel powder, cetearyl alcohol, stearic acid, cetearyl glucoside, palmitic acid, arachidic acid, dimethicone crosspolymer, disodium edta, fragrance, methylparaben, phenoxyethanol, propylparaben, benzyl alcohol, butylphenyl methylpropional, citronellol, coumarin, limonene, linalool, titanium dioxide.</li>
    <li> Decent enough cream. It&#x27;s a a little perfumy, which is nice, personally. It comes in a nice squeezable container, and is just the right size for holding, not too big.  The cream comes out in a small line which is good so you don&#x27;t get a lot on your hands. The cream is not sticky or too thick, seems the right consistency, absorbs into skin.</li>
    <li> I have read many of the reviews and can&#x27;t understand why this product is being destroyed.  I can&#x27;t say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it because I felt the fragrance was very strong if you apply a lot of it.  If you only apply a small amount, the fragrance is nice.  Plasticy?  No?  Floral?  Yes.  Refreshing?  Very much so.  I tend to get chafed in certain areas of my body and I was hoping this would help but it won&#x27;t.  The area I get chafed is very moist, and this product helps dry areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very dry areas/dry patches I&#x27;d suggest giving this a try.  The scent is nice and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> My partner has chronic skin irritation issues. We constantly buy and try new lotions to see if they are effective for his hands and arms. With him in mind, I ordered this product to see his reaction to it. He&#x27;s been using the product over the last several days, and reports a favorable reaction to this lotion. He told me his hands feel better after using it, and it appears to be effectively working on the dry spots on his hands, particularly his knuckles. The lotion promises a non-greasy feel to it, and he said that it initially it feels greasy and soaks into his skin quickly, with the slight exception of his palms. His biggest complaint about the product is its strong smell. It is really quite overpowering (I know immediately when he&#x27;s used it) but it doesn&#x27;t last. Since my partner is very sensitive to smell, it&#x27;s encouraging how much he uses this product. He indicated his sisters, who share similar skin issues, would LOVE this product. So, I recommend it!</li>
