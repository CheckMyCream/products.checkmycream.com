      <li>Leaves that nice smell in your clothes even after a while.</li>
      <li>As advertised on the label, it really does a very good job of controlling odor, and maintaining dryness.</li>
      <li>love this stuff.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite scents.</li>
      <li>Ordered these for my husband because it is his favorite brand and WalMart</li>
      <li>My favorite Axe product.</li>
      <li>My husband wasn&#x27;t able to use them.  </li>
      <li>Nice clean smell and protects all day.</li>
      <li>Not too strong.  </li>
      <li>My wife hates strong perfumes but she likes this Axe on me.</li>
      <li>otherwise it works perfectly fine and that&#x27;s it</li>
      <li>It does a fantastic job, and I am a fan of this product.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that this &amp;#34;invisible solid&amp;#34; is actually good</li>
      <li>Great scent and keeps me dry all day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other antiperspirant/deodorants and none are as good as Axe.  </li>
      <li>You see I live in the desert and on the day I am writing this our outside temp is already at 104 degrees and AXE works great.</li>
      <li>Yes, not much to say here, other than my man smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>The product does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
      <li>All of the Axe scents are nice and subtle, not too strong.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite Axe Dry scent.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent for deodorant and it keeps me rather dry.  </li>
      <li>: It goes on smooth enough, and doesn&#x27;t flake off.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping, product as described.</li>
      <li>Decent product.</li>
      <li>It goes on feeling silky smooth and thus far I haven&#x27;t had the flaky white powder problem coming off on my clothes.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Smill little different from the Kilo spray but in general it was good</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally like &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; antiperspirants (I generally prefer clear sticks, such as Right Guard&#x27;s offerings: &amp;#34;Dry as a stick, clear as a gel.&amp;#34;), but my girlfriend likes the smell of &amp;#34;Kilo,&amp;#34; so I tried it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel it works as good (keeping dry and lasting) as the other fragrances.</li>
      <li>Maybe they were just old</li>
      <li>Only Axe scent I really like.</li>
      <li>Embarrassingly cheesy TV commercials aside, I actually have had some female friends say they love the smell :-)</li>
      <li>The only scent they have that doesn&#x27;t remind me of a high school locker room.</li>

<li> These were dried out and chalky.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is so hard to find in stores.</li>
<li> Its so dry it won&#x27;t even go on, I think there is something wrong with it, you can shake it and it makes noise like something is inside.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s so dried out and almost impossible to use ...</li>
<li> Having a difficult time finding it in a store for some reason.</li>
<li> Very poor quality.  </li>
<li> Very Disappointed!!!</li>

    <li> Great deodorant.  Switched from Degree and I would say this lasts longer than Degree for me.  Smells great.  What else can ya say, it&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
    <li> its deoderant.  it works.  what else is there to say?</li>
    <li> This product works, it keeps me dry and the scent is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great price with subscribe &amp; save!</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my husband because it is his favorite brand and WalMart quit carrying the Kilo scent.  These were dried out and chalky.  My husband wasn&#x27;t able to use them.  Very poor quality.  Maybe they were just old but nevertheless, a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The only deodorant i use and i have tried them all. Great scent and keeps me dry all day.</li>
    <li> The product does exactly what it says it will do.  It goes on feeling silky smooth and thus far I haven&#x27;t had the flaky white powder problem coming off on my clothes.  That was a concern for me as I have had that problem with other solids but not with AXE so far.  The fragrance is great.  I am trying other AXE solids to compare.

    <li> Does what it is supposed to do and smells good.  Win win.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Cheaper on other sites</li>
    <li> Embarrassingly cheesy TV commercials aside, I actually have had some female friends say they love the smell :-) So do I. As advertised on the label, it really does a very good job of controlling odor, and maintaining dryness. I hope this flavor never gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> Yes, not much to say here, other than my man smells wonderful. It does a fantastic job, and I am a fan of this product.</li>
    <li> Nice clean smell and protects all day. Leaves that nice smell in your clothes even after a while. Highly recommended.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s very dry and goes on hard.</li>
    <li> My husband said it was very crumbly when applied and left those annoying little deodorant balls under his pits.  He just tossed it after a couple uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other antiperspirant/deodorants and none are as good as Axe.  I stopped using all the others several years ago as they did not last all day or would irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite Axe product.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this product.</li>
    <li> Been using Axe for years.  Works well.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent.</li>
    <li> Only Axe scent I really like. Having a difficult time finding it in a store for some reason. Works good and never feels sticky.</li>
    <li> Love Kilo Ax and can&#x27;t beat the price here!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent for deodorant and it keeps me rather dry.  I tend to sweat a lot and this brand actually works for me.  I also use the spray whenever I need a simple smell and I am not going anywhere fancy.</li>
    <li> This product smells good.  Not too strong.  It lasts a long time all day even during workouts and after.  It is parsimonious in that one of these can last months for me.</li>
    <li> Only place I can find the Kilo, which my son loves.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Axe Dry scent.  Makes me want to smell my own pits all day.</li>
    <li> I now know why it&#x27;s not available in the stores anymore ... I&#x27;ve only opened one but it&#x27;s so dried out and almost impossible to use ... If the next order is like this I will cancel ... Very Disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Decent product. It was a good buy from Amazon. It is a great smelling deodorant.</li>
    <li> As with all soaps and shampoos the smell is always a matter of face otherwise it works perfectly fine and that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> Used it for years.  Feeling the need to stock up in case they discontinue it.  The only scent they have that doesn&#x27;t remind me of a high school locker room.</li>
