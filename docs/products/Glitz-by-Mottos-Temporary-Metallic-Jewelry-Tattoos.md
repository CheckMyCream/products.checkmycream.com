<li> Then they removed the clear plastic tattoo protector and placed their selected tattoo face down.</li>
<li> After cutting out the tattoo they chose a dry, clean area of skin that they wanted their new tattoo to be.</li>
<li> IF you want to remove the tattoo early or if it did not wear off evenly then just use a little bit of baby oil on a cotton ball to get the rest off.</li>
<li> wait 10-15seconds (the box says 30) and pull off slowly and your ready to rock for up to 6 days.</li>
<li> I literally spent at least 5 minutes going through the various sets and finally settling on the forever young collection.</li>
<li> They literally spent more time choosing which tattoo they wanted to put on and cutting it out from the sheet than they did applying it.</li>
<li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that there is an outline of glue that leaves a mark around the tattoos and after few days it looks funky...</li>
<li> They used a wet VIVA paper towel laid over the tattoo for about half a minute and then carefully peeled the backing off and tossed it.</li>
<li> My daughters had 10 each on in less than 8 minutes.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t show up looking all plain jane.</li>
<li> so it was a little hard to make them out</li>
<li> so I was not able to use these in my trip.</li>
<li> Some of them were small with the amount of detail</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> These are amazing.  We used them at a birthday party for my 13 year old and all of the kids loved them.</li>
    <li> What a fun idea! I&#x27;ve seen these tattoos before all over the media. They are so easy to put on and look fabulous! Great alternative for those who don&#x27;t want a permanent tattoo. After wearing just one day I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments!</li>
    <li> This is a fun itwm to purchase to use if you are not one to get tattoos.  What is great about these is that you can choose to coordinate with your outfit.  I have had a lot of compliments on them.</li>
    <li> These are so popular right now I had to see what the hype was all about. They are beautiful. Easy to apply like any other temporary tattoo. I am so excited to use these this summer. They last all day. I love it. I received this product at a discount for my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> These are cute and good quality. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that there is an outline of glue that leaves a mark around the tattoos and after few days it looks funky...Even when I try to cut the tattoo out as closely to the outline as possible.</li>
    <li> When I was offered these glitz tattoos at a discount during a promotion in exchange for my honest review I couldn&#x27;t pass it up!! The hardest part was picking which collection I wanted to purchase! I literally spent at least 5 minutes going through the various sets and finally settling on the forever young collection. I chose that collection because I thought it would satisfy both my daughters and my taste...and it did! I absolutely love these tattoos....you can dress them up or stress them down and let&#x27;s not forget that beach season is pretty much here! That means you can accessories your bikini or swimsuit with these tattoos!! I have seen the same quality tattoos go for much more on &#x27;celebrity&#x27; jewelry lines simply for the name...these are Affordable and of great quality, but most importantly cute!!! My daughter and I both love them!</li>
    <li> I received these metallic temporary tattoos for a product review and love them. With Easter coming, right around the corner, these are a must have for basket stuffing. You can even cut some out individually and hide in plastic eggs for your job, for your Easter dinner or even for kids school events. This set comes with 6 full sheets of tattoos and there are more than 60 total. Couple that with the fact that they have a money back guarantee and you have a value that you cannot beat. My favorite tattoos in this set are the nature themed tattoos like the trees, blowing dandelion,  the peacock feather and the safari animals. There are so many choices in each pack that  you are certain to find a tattoo that would please any one. There are three collections to choose from, I got the Forever Young collection, but there is also a Colors collection and an Elegant collection. They are very easy to put on. My daughters had 10 each on in less than 8 minutes. They literally spent more time choosing which tattoo they wanted to put on and cutting it out from the sheet than they did applying it. After cutting out the tattoo they chose a dry, clean area of skin that they wanted their new tattoo to be. Then they removed the clear plastic tattoo protector and placed their selected tattoo face down. They used a wet VIVA paper towel laid over the tattoo for about half a minute and then carefully peeled the backing off and tossed it. Voila! Just like that, they had a tattoo. The tattoos lasted 4 days on my youngest daughter and 5 days on my oldest daughter, but they can last up to 6 days even with regular showering. IF you want to remove the tattoo early or if it did not wear off evenly then just use a little bit of baby oil on a cotton ball to get the rest off. You can also use an alcohol pad, but I do not let my girls use too much alcohol because of its potential to dry out their skin. These are so fun for children three and up all the way to adults. If you are looking for a great, unique and easy temporary tattoo look no further. This one will delight you and if it does not then there is always the risk free guarantee!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to give these to my granddaughter.  I&#x27;m sure she will love them!!</li>
    <li> Color of some Tattoos is very vivid. :-) It lasts two days if it is protected from water...</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:283d7f995771f38ec7580f5c928c6f17]] WHERE THE PARTY AT? Don&#x27;t show up looking all plain jane. Add some metallic tattoos for the ultimate fashion statement! There are TONS of different designs to pick from and they are SUPER EASY to apply. Just cut out what you want, put it on your skin then apply a warm compress (paper towel or towel is fine) wait 10-15seconds (the box says 30) and pull off slowly and your ready to rock for up to 6 days. You can remove the tattoo with baby oil if you are more of a one nighter type of person. Mottos supplied the sample for review and I would like to thank them for that. Check out my demo video.</li>
    <li> love these for the summer!</li>
    <li> My Glitz by Mottos Elegant Collection tattoos arrived in the mail nicely packaged with easy to understand directions. I was pleased to see the assortment of designs to chose from. I followed the directions on how to apply and they were very easy to use. The tattoos have great graffics, colors, shine and add that sparkle to your body. I would definitely purchase again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured. Cute and fun tattoos to slice up your look or to wear instead of jewelry!</li>
    <li> Love them, but haven&#x27;t tried them yet. I&#x27;m saving them for when I go out.</li>
    <li> Perfect, These seem pricy but these types of tattoos are pricy and you get a lot of them in this pack. I ended up buying more.</li>
    <li> The tattoos looked very cheap. Good for kids maybe? Also, the delivery didn&#x27;t get home on time so I was not able to use these in my trip. I ended up returning them since they were no longer needed. The point was to use them in the Caribbean sea. Nevertheless, the vendor is very receptive to feedback.</li>
    <li> So fun and cute! I got asked questions if they were real!</li>
    <li> I love this. The detailing of the tattoos are wonderful. Some of them were small with the amount of detail so it was a little hard to make them out but overall the options were great.</li>
    <li> Easy to put on, easy to remove and looks great. For sixty plus tattoos, the price is also great.</li>
