      <li>My skin feels better already</li>
      <li>I was even more pleased to see that this product had no nut oils in it, so I could try them.</li>
      <li>Refreshing at times when you&#x27;re just feeling grubby too, times</li>
      <li>I normally love Burt&#x27;s Bees products</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of cleansing wipes and these are some of the best I have tried.</li>
      <li>Overall, very happy with these... thumbs up for Burt&#x27;s Bees towelettes.</li>
      <li>I love anything peach.</li>
      <li>If I use these at home I still tend to rinse my face after using the wipes, but that&#x27;s more of a habit than anything.  </li>
      <li>do love the scents and will find a way to use them - probably as hand wipes after picnics -</li>
      <li>The plastic flip top stays in place.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These regular wipes are wonderful!</li>
      <li>Campers will love them too.</li>
      <li>These towelettes are refreshing</li>
      <li>Burts Bees makes great products and these cleansing cloths are my new favorite.</li>
      <li>The packaging is better than most, and each item is easy to remove and re-close, keeping the moisture in.</li>
      <li>I keep one packet in my refrigerator and it feels so good to sue these on hot days</li>
      <li>The White Tea towelettes were very pleasant to use, with a light, refreshing fragrance that did not linger.</li>
      <li>it was almost scent free, but still nice and clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>The White Tea wipes smell AMAZING and do an excellent job of keeping my face fresh and clean without drying.</li>
      <li>Great sent and the cloths are soft on your face.</li>
      <li>How convenient and thoughtful is that? :-)  </li>
      <li>I really love the light scents of both.</li>
      <li>They get off makeup easily and are a great choice for my young daughter when she has to wear stage makeup for a performance.</li>
      <li>But for the rest of my face, makeup comes off easily.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s pretty nice...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good wipe when one&#x27;s sweating, or just feels like one wants a pleasantly cool cleansing touch.  </li>
      <li>I just rinsed my face off afterward and if felt fine.  </li>
      <li>They are so gentle and effective.</li>
      <li>I would be happy to use these daily without worry of over stripping my skin.</li>
      <li>He said it felt really great and left his face squeaky clean (&amp;#34;yeah,</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent of both cleansers (the regular wipe and the exfoliating one) is light and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>As far as performance, I was very pleased as well.</li>
      <li>so you fell like your face is getting clean.</li>
      <li>I feel CLEAN...  </li>
      <li>My brother in law came to visit and they helped him rejuvenate and clean his hands after a grueling a six hour drive in stop and go traffic.  </li>
      <li>However, I absolutely love to use them on hot days when I want to clean the sweat off my neck, chest and arms for a quick freshen-up.  </li>
      <li>We received Peach and White Tea towelettes and my wife loved them.</li>
      <li>so I really like how these removed the shine from my skin where I tend to get more oil build-up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They do a good enough job of cleaning my face.  </li>
      <li>The price, I think, is more than reasonable.  </li>
      <li>they have quickly become my favorites.  </li>
      <li>I received these free for an honest review, and I will definitely keep myself supplied with them.</li>
      <li>I have used a lot of different facial wipes (Ponds, Oil of Olay, Nature&#x27;s Best, etc.)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t because these are so quick to use.  </li>
      <li>These towelettes are smooth and soft, they feel pretty good, but I don&#x27;t feel like they do a whole lot for my skin.</li>
      <li>My normal brand of makeup remover wipes is Kirkland (Costco&#x27;s brand) and I love them.</li>
      <li>First impressions are important.  </li>
      <li>These towelettes, both the White Tea and the Peach Willow Bark, smell absolutely great and the initial contact is truly refreshing.  </li>
      <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last after I clean my face and for me that is a great thing as I am very sensitive to smells</li>
      <li>The packs of Burt’s Bees facial cleansers have been really nice for me to clean my face.</li>
      <li>I know this is going to sound a bit unusual...</li>
      <li>Great to keep in the car for emergency messy cleaning too.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are lightweight facial cloths, lightly scented and not very strong. For makeup minimalists such as myself, they&#x27;re sufficient, but I only use a beblesh balm (tinted moisturizer) and tinted lip balm, and much of that wears off during the day. These facial wipes can&#x27;t compete with [[ASIN:B00F45FRM2 4 Pack Kirkland Signature Hypoallergenic Daily Facial Cleansing Towelettes 150 Wipes]] in cleansing power, but I trust the Burt&#x27;s Bees brand for gentle, less pharmaceutical ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually use these most in the mornings when I&#x27;m very rushed for time. I wipe off my face, fold the cloth so I can use the edges and back for a quick swipe of my underarms, then apply moisturizer to my face and deodorant to my armpits. When traveling, I&#x27;ve also used one towelette at night before bed, first on my face, then on my feet. The exfoliating one is heftier than the white tea one, but neither can compete with a regular facial cleansing routine and moisturizer. Disposable anything isn&#x27;t so good for the environment, so I reserve these for occasional use, such as while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rest in peace, Burt Shavit (May 15, 1935 - July 5, 2015)</li>
    <li> Love the White Tea Extract wipes. They are great for removing makeup and dirt at the end of the day. Great sent and the cloths are soft on your face. The Willow Bark wipes, I&#x27;m not as wild about. I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is as clean as it would be with facial cleanser, but if you don&#x27;t have access to water, these will work. They have a woody scent that lasts about a half hour.</li>
    <li> These are great when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face at the end of a long day.  They are nice and big and moist - the package is effective at keeping them that way -  and when I&#x27;m tempted to skip my ablutions I don&#x27;t because these are so quick to use.  They don&#x27;t exfoliate much but do get my face clean and I think my skin is looking a little better since I&#x27;ve been using them.  Refreshing at times when you&#x27;re just feeling grubby too, times I don&#x27;t ordinarily wash my face.</li>
    <li> Love these facial cleaning wipes!  First, the packaging is great.  Sometimes when I use wipes, closing them so that that stay moist is a pain.  This lids pop back open or the tape loses its stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;These closures, the snap closure and the tape, stays secure.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the fragrance on both is pleasant, but not too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Third, they really get the make-up off!  One toilette, front and back, cleaned my face when I usually need two.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend these for occasional facial cleaning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold on this product.  I live in the southern California desert where living with blowing wind and dust is to be expected.  These towelettes are refreshing and I didn&#x27;t have any negative reactions to them at all.  If I use them to blot my face - it gets to be over 100 here in the summer - I find my make up is still on, but the perspiration is gone.  I noticed such a mild scent it was almost scent free, but still nice and clean smelling.  I keep one packet in my refrigerator and it feels so good to sue these on hot days they have quickly become my favorites.  The price, I think, is more than reasonable.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different facial wipes (Ponds, Oil of Olay, Nature&#x27;s Best, etc.) and these Burt&#x27;s Bees facial wipes are my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These regular wipes are wonderful! They smell great, feel silky and not sticky, and remove eye and face makeup easily without stinging. They are so gentle and effective. My 5 year old daughter loves to mop up with one after a couple hours of dusty, sweaty outdoor playtime; she says she thinks they smell like honey bees would. I agree, the other facial wipes I have tried in the past smell like perfume or chemicals, the Burt&#x27;s Bees brand wipes smell like you just rubbed your face in a fresh botanical garden -- the smell dissipates quickly but I actually wish it stuck around a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating wipes are also great and smell heavenly! The cloth is textured to do the exfoliating, it is not a gritty experience like some exfoliating products tend to be. I would be happy to use these daily without worry of over stripping my skin. They smell fruity and deliciously herbaceous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use both of these everyday, I live in California and we are in the 4th year of a serious drought. This is a GREAT way to save water! They would be perfect to take on any variety of trips and camping excursions. Great to keep in the car for emergency messy cleaning too. So nice to have with small children!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: They come with a sticker over the hole under the lid that you are supposed to remove, but I pull it back halfway to get a wipe out and put it back down under the lid. This insures that the moisture stays inside the pouch instead of evaporating; the lid clicks closed, but it doesn&#x27;t have a gasket so I thought to keep the sticker on as an extra measure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating this 3 stars, because I have mixed feelings about the 2 different products packaged together --- White Tea Extract cleansing and Peach and Willow Bark exfoliating.  I first tried the White Tea Extract.  I just didn&#x27;t feel like it removed much of my makeup.  I rubbed and scrubbed and used as much of the cloth as I could.  After a couple days of trying this kind, I moved onto the Peach and Willow Bark exfoliating towelette.  Now this one DID remove my makeup very well.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I have combination skin, and I&#x27;m not sure I would want to use it everyday, because it may be a bit drying.  However, I plan to keep them in stock for the times I&#x27;m too lazy to actually wash my face with my regular cleanser.  However, I will not be using the White Tea Extract unless I&#x27;m absolutely desperate and out of other cleansing wipes.</li>
    <li> The White Tea wipes smell AMAZING and do an excellent job of keeping my face fresh and clean without drying.</li>
    <li> First impressions are important.  These towelettes, both the White Tea and the Peach Willow Bark, smell absolutely great and the initial contact is truly refreshing.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s all the good news about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Peach Willow Bark towelettes are intended to exfoliate.  They are very mildly abrasive, not too harsh at all.  However, both towelettes leave a residue on my face.  Several minutes after application, my skin is sticky, and several hours later it is greasy.  I have a slightly oily T-zone but in general my skin is pretty dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the scents and will find a way to use them - probably as hand wipes after picnics - but I will not be purchasing additional product.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees does it again!  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product because it&#x27;s convenient, easy to use and each sheet is larger than expected. This extra size makes it possible for me to not ony cleanse my face but my front and back neck areas also. Due to typing so much, my neck tends to get still and sore. You&#x27;d be surprised how refreshing these cleansing towelettes are.  As for the exfoliating towelettes, they certainly do a good job getting the deeper grit that somehow develops on our skin. My skin feels better already and I&#x27;ve only used them two days. I feel CLEAN...  So they take a little getting used to as you learn how to best remove just one at a time, but that is a minor inconvenience for a product that makes me feel so refreshed.  Scents have never bothered me, but since my daughter visits often and has sensitive skin, I thoroughly appreciate that these are odor-free. This makes it possible for me to leave a package on the bathroom sink for all guests to use. How convenient and thoughtful is that? :-)  Thanks, Burt&#x27;s Bees for another helpful addition to my skin-care regimen.  I received these free for an honest review, and I will definitely keep myself supplied with them. Awesome sauce, as my daughter would say.

    <li> Out of all of the different facial cleansing towelettes I&#x27;ve tried (Neutrogena, Olay, Simple, and Biore to name a few) these Burt&#x27;s Bees are in my top two.  (I also really like Simple.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of both cleansers (the regular wipe and the exfoliating one) is light and pleasant.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last after I clean my face and for me that is a great thing as I am very sensitive to smells and if they linger on my face I&#x27;m done for.  Congestion and sneezing won&#x27;t be far behind.  So yay for scents that are pleasant while using the product, but go away when you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular towelettes are great for getting all of your makeup off, even my eye liner came off without much trouble. It&#x27;s a very soft and smooth wipe and gentle on your skin. If I use these at home I still tend to rinse my face after using the wipes, but that&#x27;s more of a habit than anything.  If I bring them to the gym to use before or after working out, I&#x27;m not usually worrying about spending extra time rinsing my face off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this 3 piece set because it gives you a lot more of the everyday towelettes and less of the exfoliating ones - most of us aren&#x27;t exfoliating our faces every day, my sensitive skin certainly couldn&#x27;t take that.  The exfoliating towelettes are my favorite smelling of all of the ones I&#x27;ve tried and they are strong enough to really clean my skin, but gentle enough for use on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I don’t wear makeup but I use the facial towelettes to wipe my face on hot days (we live in California and it’s the middle of the drought) and on those days when work is coming hard and fast and my face gets sweaty.  I found that these towelettes to be amazingly refreshing.  They also wipe away grime.  My brother in law came to visit and they helped him rejuvenate and clean his hands after a grueling a six hour drive in stop and go traffic.  So these are a very handy thing to have.  I have noticed though that if I use the towelettes several times within about 30 minutes they do make the skin on my face feel a little tight.  They still rejuvenate so if it’s a hard day I sometimes feel that the tightness is worth it but frequent use does seem to cause me to have a mild reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the size and the softness of the wipes.  They are soft and stretch so I can wipe my entire face with one of them.  That means that, with 30 in a pack, it’s a great bargain.  Good thing too because the rate at which I use them means I am going to go through them quite quickly indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating wipes are also quite good.  They are not as harsh as some other exfoliating products I’ve tried and they get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the scent on all of them is great; there but not too strong.  (Though I admit to a preference for the peach willow bark.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my overall impression is that these are a great way to revive yourself during a hot or hard day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going for cleaning towelettes, I recommend getting purely the Exfoliating Peach type. It&#x27;s currently a better deal for the money, the scent is great, and in my opinion exfoliating towelettes are the best facial towelettes. Outside of travel, it makes more sense to just use a liquid or foam wash to simply wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Burt&#x27;s Bees Exfoliating Peach has a lovely scent, it exfoliates enough to remove dry skin but not enough to irritate the skin, and you can really use the whole towelette if you also wash your neck and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the White Tea to have a slightly odd scent. I still can&#x27;t place it, but it&#x27;s part good and part not good. These towelettes are smooth and soft, they feel pretty good, but I don&#x27;t feel like they do a whole lot for my skin. The towelettes are huge, which can be nice but also seems like a waste. I&#x27;d rather have twice as many towelettes at half the size.&lt;br /&gt;Because, frankly... 25 exfoliating, 30 + 30 plain wipes, at currently ~$18, means 21¢ per towelette. That doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot, but if you are using this once every day, that means $76 a year for face wash. I can buy a nice liquid wash for $30 that lasts more than a year. If you don&#x27;t use this as your daily solution, it makes a lot more sense. It feels GREAT to be able to wash your face during a car trip or plane ride, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also not a fan of how the towelettes are packed, they are rather hard to remove.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for us guys as well as for you gals.  It&#x27;s a good wipe when one&#x27;s sweating, or just feels like one wants a pleasantly cool cleansing touch.  I like the way they&#x27;re packaged so that they stay sealed, being removable by a snap that keeps the moisture within .  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This three-pack of Burt&#x27;s Bees Cleansing Cloths is just perfect. One of the packs is exfoliating and left my skin feeling cool and clean on this hot sticky summer day. They cloths are perfect for use at home or traveling to remove makeup for women or just clean and cool a man&#x27;s face. The ingredients are pure and the packs are well sealed to prevent dying out. The exfoliating cloths are peach and willow bark scented and the cleansing cloths contain white tea extract. Burt&#x27;s Bees products are never tested on animals and bear the &amp;#34;Cruelty Free&amp;#34; logo. The cleansing cloths contain 30-per pack, while the exfoliating cloths contain 25-per pack. This is a great product for anyone in your family to freshen up or remove makeup thoroughly before bedtime. Campers will love them too.</li>
    <li> I got these so I could use them while I&#x27;m on the road, after a long day&#x27;s work and before a long drive home. The White Tea towelettes were very pleasant to use, with a light, refreshing fragrance that did not linger. The peach exfoliating ones, however, I did not enjoy. The fragrance was not so much like fresh peaches as it was... heavy and peach-ish. After using it my skin was taut and dry as a bone so I recommend using a moisturizer afterwards. But the main thing is that that fake peach smell lingered on, and that&#x27;s a deal breaker for me. So a mixed result.</li>
    <li> I normally love Burt&#x27;s Bees products but I wasn&#x27;t sold on these cleansing towelettes for daily use. I know this is going to sound a bit unusual... but to me the best use of these towelettes are for camping and long trips with limited access to water. I don&#x27;t find them appropriate enough for daily use, but they were perfect to use on a recent trip. I now keep a pack of the cleansing wipes in my vehicle and in my luggage so I have them with me when I need to freshen my face especially on these hot sweaty days of summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different facial towelettes as my younger kids hate using soap and water on their face. So if you have a child worried about soap in their eyes, these are a great. For those who wear make-up, these don&#x27;t replace the old facial cleansers. If your out camping or want something to clean off as much make-up as possibly before a hard workout, then these will do the trick. However, I found they didn&#x27;t remove my eye make-up all that great and I had to use two or three to get my foundation completely removed. More work than it should be and personally, my facial cleanser would do the trick in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating towelettes don&#x27;t replace facial exfoliating scrubs, but I did like using these after cleansing my face as tightened my pores nicely and left my face smoother for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are also good if after a workout or on a hot summer day when you wear little to no make-up to clean the oils off your face. I have combination skin so I really like how these removed the shine from my skin where I tend to get more oil build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin hasn&#x27;t reacted to using this product and it doesn&#x27;t feel too dry after using either. I&#x27;m not sure if someone who tends to have dry skin will feel these don&#x27;t dry their face out more as I notice my skin feels drier then after using a normal facial cleansing product with toner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of cleansing wipes and these are some of the best I have tried. The white tea ones have a wonderful citrus scent and feel good against the skin. Great for after waxing and removing the finishing oil. The peach willow bark ones are okay although I expected them to be scrubby since they claim to exfoliate. They were pretty good, but I didn&#x27;t like them as much as the white tea. They did leave my face feeling soft &amp; moisturized​.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very easy to access even though the opening is small (which helps keep them moist.) The plastic flip top stays in place. These are a good size for the face and they are quite damp without being drippy. I even used one on the dog to freshen her up. With the weather getting hotter and hotter right now, these will be great to have on hand. I am very happy with these wipes.</li>
    <li> These towelettes are really nice and I like them better than some other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  The peach exfoliating ones really get deep down clean and make your face feel so much nicer and cleaner.  I used them even after showering and still had extra stuff come off my face onto the towelette.  The tea one smells heavenly also and even though that is just a cleaner and not exfoliating like the peach ones they still make you feel at your best.  I carry a pouch of them with me in the car since Summer can be rough on the skin and I like to make sure my face is fresh after driving with the windows down.  I love these and will be buying Burt&#x27;s from now on.  I already love some of the other product lines and now there&#x27;s one to more add to my list.</li>
    <li> The packs of Burt’s Bees facial cleansers have been really nice for me to clean my face. They get off makeup easily and are a great choice for my young daughter when she has to wear stage makeup for a performance. They seem to do a nice job of cleaning my face of dirt and oil too. It says no rinsing is necessary, but I usually feel better if I splash a bit of cold water on my face after using these towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This collection comes with two packages of 30 facial cleaning towelettes with white tea extract and one 25 pack of exfoliating towelettes with peach and willow bark. The scent is pleasant for both of them. The regular ones are very soft and it’s almost like just wiping off your face with something damp. The exfoliating ones have some texture to them, but not enough to rub my skin raw. I haven’t had any stinging or redness or any bad reaction with this product. I’ve really like all the Burt’s Bees products I’ve tried and this one is no exception.</li>
    <li> Pleasant enough, but I think I prefer something with less scent.  The scent does linger for a little while.  I normally use a washcloth and am unlikely to switch to something you throw away for a daily routine, but these would be useful on a trip or some other time you don&#x27;t have access to laundering wash clothes. They do a good enough job of cleaning my face.  It does tingle a bit, but no irritation or breakouts from them.  My skin felt a little sticky afterwards but soon recovered.  I wiped my eyes without irritating my eyes. I don&#x27;t wear mascara so I don&#x27;t know how well it would work with removing that.</li>
    <li> I want to like these because I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products generally, but I just can&#x27;t get past the scent.  I find it irritating, and I can&#x27;t help but feel that these added &amp;#34;extracts&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t good for your skin.  I think you should keep things simple -- nothing added that could cause your skin to have an inflamed reaction, and I don&#x27;t see how the benefits of these ingredients could outweigh the possible irritation that the same might cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I did like the texture of the exfoliating cloth.  I felt like I got more of a &amp;#34;bang&amp;#34; in cleansing than I usually do with cleansing towelettes.  But, still, it smelled like peach, which means added scent, which means added, unnecessary, ingredient.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of facial cleansing cloths and have tried many brands. These stand out because they are larger than many other brands. My pet peeve with facial cloths are they always seem to be so small. These are of fairly good size. They are soft but also have just a bit of texture so you fell like your face is getting clean. There is really not much of a scent, so it will not interfere with any other scented products you want to use, or if you have sensitivity to scents, you probably would not be bothered. The exfoliating type made my face feel a slight burning sensation after I used it. I supposed this was the &amp;#34;active ingredient&#x27; going to work to exfoliate, so I felt like it must be working. I just rinsed my face off afterward and if felt fine.  Burts Bees makes great products and these cleansing cloths are my new favorite.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. These wipes did not cause any breakouts, rashes, reddening, or blemishes on my skin. The facial wipes remove mascara and makeup. The exfoliating wipes cleanse my pores. Very soothing and do not leave my skin feeling dry. These are great for travel and for stashing in our camper bathroom. I’m not impressed with the packaging because the wipes do not dispense easily. You have to fish them out of the little hole and often get two at time and have to stuff the other one back in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees, so I was thrilled to see these come up on Vine to review. I was even more pleased to see that this product had no nut oils in it, so I could try them. I really love the light scents of both. Ive never used a Burt&#x27;s Bees product that had an overbearing scent. As far as performance, I was very pleased as well. I could see both makeup and dirt on the cloth after using. They didn&#x27;t leave a heavy wetness or soapy feel on my face like some of these sorts of wipes do. And, most importantly, to me anyway, they didn&#x27;t sting or leave my skin red like chemical laden products do. I was very pleased. And, for the price and size of the wipes packs, I thing they are well worth the money. Actually, the wipes are a little big, standard in size comparable to other similar products out there. I can cut them in half to use, doubling the amount of uses I get out of a pack.</li>
    <li> We received Peach and White Tea towelettes and my wife loved them. Fragrance is nice and mostly it did the job by removing the makeup, Peach &amp; White Tea fragrance is pleasant, I am not sure about the other ones. As they are priced now, at about  15c a towelette, they are a little more expensive than other brands.</li>
    <li> I received a box of 3 packages, 2 in white-tea scent and 1 that exfoliates in a peach scent (my fave). I love anything peach. The packaging is better than most, and each item is easy to remove and re-close, keeping the moisture in. For travel though they are bulky to pack, unless you are going to be gone for eons.  For a weekend away, I just put a couple in a ziplock in my overnight case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They remove makeup well, and are generous in size, unlike other brands I have tried. I don&#x27;t use these on my eyes as they are very sensitive and under treatment. I remove eye makeup with baby oil (doctors orders), and that works well for me. But for the rest of my face, makeup comes off easily. I do rinse afterwards, and use a night cream at the end of the day. Overall, very happy with these... thumbs up for Burt&#x27;s Bees towelettes.</li>
    <li> OMG these towelettes are AWESOME. I live on the Florida-Georgia line and today the heat index has reached over 100 degrees. I put these in the freezer for about an hour and then brought the exfoliating one outside to my husband who was trimming the hedges.  I could smell it right out of the package, so very delicious like a Georgia peach.  The dirt wiped right off his face -- this is in comparison to his little white towel that wiped off the sweat and left the dirt.  He said it felt really great and left his face squeaky clean (&amp;#34;yeah, that&#x27;s pretty nice... smells good... see all that dirt??! Hahaha!&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve never used towelettes to take off my make-up because I am afraid of them.  I&#x27;ve had acne since before I could speak (as a baby in diapers, no kidding) and my skin is very sensitive.  However, I absolutely love to use them on hot days when I want to clean the sweat off my neck, chest and arms for a quick freshen-up.  I admit that I&#x27;ve avoided purchasing Burts Bees in the past because they&#x27;re a little more expensive, but the SMELL, oh the smell is just so delicious that I might have to make an exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a make-up remover I cannot comment, but as a quick freshen-upper when you are hot and sweaty -- or even if you&#x27;re not, you&#x27;ve just been at work all day and you just want a clean feeling -- then these are excellent.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for these wipes which is very sad to me because I enjoy many of the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products. My normal brand of makeup remover wipes is Kirkland (Costco&#x27;s brand) and I love them. I have also used Neutragena. I would say these rate above Neutragena but below Kirkland. I DO like the fact the packets of wipes can *click* shut (as Kirkland&#x27;s do) but the texture of the cloths is weird and although they claim to be &amp;#34;no rinse&#x27; wipes, my face is very sticky after using them and I definitely need to rinse to get rid of the sticky film. The scent is light and non-offensive but you do need to use more than one wipe to remove mascara because they aren&#x27;t damp enough to do the job without pulling on eye skin.</li>
