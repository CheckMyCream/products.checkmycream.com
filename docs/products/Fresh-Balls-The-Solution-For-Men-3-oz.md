      <li>As a guy, I&#x27;m not used to spending more than about $5 for a grooming product, so the price of $12+ for about 3 ounces is a bit excessing.  </li>

      <li>read a recommendation in Men&#x27;s Health Magazine - ordered on line - been using it for a month now - the boys always smell fresh and clean - Amazing  </li>

      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>While on mission convoys, riding in an heavy-metal, \\&quot;light or no AC blowing\\&quot; truck for hours on end, wearing over 100 lbs of gear in 128 degree heat, my balls would sweat and slide all over my leg like they were being sauteed in olive oil.</li>
      <li>Smooth application</li>
      <li>There is a great deal of jokes out there about this stuff, but I found something that actually WORKS!!!</li>
      <li>This is a great product if you ride motorcycles or work outside a lot.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a big man like myself who tends to sweat too much, this stuff is great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually excited to post this review because the product isn&#x27;t one that you go around talking about.</li>
      <li>treated area will feel great after a long work day 9-6.</li>
      <li>But, this is a must for all men, great product, at the end of long day I still smell like I just got out of the shower.</li>
      <li>My husband at first wasn&#x27;t so sure about using it.</li>
      <li>the smell isn&#x27;&#x27;t over powering its just clean smelling.</li>
      <li>Keeps you dry and smelling great.</li>
      <li>It smells great, and keeps you dry.</li>
      <li>But like i said, the product inside works and is a cool idea.</li>
      <li>I sent an email offering to pay for better packaging but they went above and beyond, sending me not one, but FIVE replacement tubes FREE of charge!</li>
      <li>Cheap and exact what was promised.</li>
      <li>Totally better than inhaling baby powder or something, and much easier to apply exactly where you need it.</li>
      <li>The only reason I can&#x27;t give it five stars is, I need ample summer weather to fully test it, but so far, I am very pleased, some sweat more than others.</li>
      <li>The boys stay nice and dry, comfortable all day, regardless of the temperature or humidity.</li>
      <li>but, it smells good, keeps you fresh &amp; dry and the chicks dig it!</li>
      <li>I hope my review makes clear that I love this product.</li>
      <li>Apply a dab to the areas you want to keep fresh.  </li>
      <li>and i guess fresh.</li>
      <li>I even considered the rarely heard these days \\&quot;nocturnal emission\\&quot; as an, albeit pleasurable.</li>
      <li>Fresh balls goes on as a wet-ish cream and eventually dries.  </li>
      <li>No clouds of powder or funky smells just fresh balls.</li>
      <li>, Fresh Balls got glowing reviews, so I bit the bullett and purchased it.  </li>
      <li>Well, I think it is well worth it.  </li>
      <li>I then discovered Fresh Balls.  </li>
      <li>You need to know that Fresh Balls is not inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>have fun</li>
      <li>way better then baby powder and no mess like baby powder</li>
      <li>The other reviews on here were great for this product, so I had high hopes.</li>
      <li>Today I used Fresh Balls for the first time, and it performed like a champ.  </li>
      <li>I pour concrete for a living and fresh balls keeps them cool ,nonsticky and fresh all day in the heat</li>
      <li>not anymore, now it&#x27;s nice and dry.</li>
      <li>Felt nice at the begning but really dosnt last.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the review I posted on their website slightly modified for here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a US Marine, I deployed to Afghanistan in 2010 during the summer months. While on mission convoys, riding in an heavy-metal, \\&quot;light or no AC blowing\\&quot; truck for hours on end, wearing over 100 lbs of gear in 128 degree heat, my balls would sweat and slide all over my leg like they were being sauteed in olive oil. I tried various powders only to have my balls looking like two powdered-donut holes by the end of the day. I saw this product in a fitness magazine and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first tube arrived damaged and it&#x27;s contents emptied out into the packaging. I sent an email offering to pay for better packaging but they went above and beyond, sending me not one, but FIVE replacement tubes FREE of charge! I kept two and passed the other three out to other Marines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the very next convoy, I decided to try out Fresh Balls. What can I say? In a word....INCREDIBLE!!! Even riding for 6 hours to our mission, despite sweating like a hooker in church, this product held up solidly as I probably could have struck a match on my balls they were so dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their staff and product are AMAZING and you have a customer for LIFE!!!!</li>
    <li> I work outdoors and am on my feet constantly, walking in the hot Nevada sun.  During the course of an 8 hour shift, my balls get hot and sweaty, and I actually feel perspiration running down my leg.  By the time my shift is finished, my crotch is extremely sore from chafing.  Powder works well, but is messy to apply.  I think I get more on the floor than on my body.  Today I used Fresh Balls for the first time, and it performed like a champ.  I had to work an extra 2 1/2 hours today, and I was dry all day long with absolutely no chafing.  A small amount of Fresh Balls creme was all it took to make me feel comfortable in the crotch area on a very hot day.  This product is great and performs as advertised.</li>
    <li> Totally better than inhaling baby powder or something, and much easier to apply exactly where you need it. I didn&#x27;t have any of the gunky buildup that some people complain about. Maybe a chalky look just as I would have with powder, but nothing odd or unsightly. I will say though that I do constantly go back and forth still between this and powder. Just can&#x27;t decide which is best.</li>
    <li> It goes on as a cream and dries into a powder! Would most likely buy this item again. No Complaints.</li>
    <li> After hearing the ads for Fresh Balls on Satellite Radio for the last year, I finally gave Fresh Balls a try.  Admitedly, when I first heard their commercials I thought it was some ridiculously gimicky product that probably didn&#x27;t work.  I am a very athletic and active guy who sweats.  Can&#x27;t help it, but when ever the outside temp is above 60 degrees, I start to sweat in all the right areas, including my nether regions.  Anyway, I hated using powder due to the mess it left and the fears regarding talc and a possible cancer risk.  The cornstarch powders just clump up and are nasty at the end of the day.  I finally started to do a little research and overwhelmingly Fresh Balls was getting great reviews.  Site after site I visited, Fresh Balls got glowing reviews, so I bit the bullett and purchased it.  Wow, this stuff is great.  It keeps me dry and fresh downstairs all day.  Be realistic though, if its 90 degrees outside or your at the gym doing cardio for an hour, you are still going to sweat, but you will at least smell a whole lot fresher afterwards.  Plus, the wife seems to like it (nod, nod, wink, wink).  My only complaint is the price.  As a guy, I&#x27;m not used to spending more than about $5 for a grooming product, so the price of $12+ for about 3 ounces is a bit excessing.  Overall though, I&#x27;m happy, and did I mention so is the wife ;)!!!!</li>
    <li> this is a great product and i have been using it for about two years now. did have a issue when they changed their formula earlier in 2011 but they have fixed that issue. although i would recommend buying the product directly from the manufacture of fresh balls to ensure that you get the reformulated version and maybe not a older one</li>
    <li> If you are a guy, you need this product! It keeps the boys fresh and dry all day and that makes me happy! Lol. It really is awesome. If you&#x27;re using baby powder or corn starch you gotta try this and you&#x27;ll never go back. I just ordered my 2nd order.</li>
    <li> My son bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day.  My husband at first wasn&#x27;t so sure about using it. But when he did, he was very impressed. Since he does a lot of walking, he sweats alot. This product does keep him dry, and keeps him from chafing.  He requested that I keep buying this product for him.  And I have.</li>
    <li> Got sweat down there, get this. May sound crude but this product exists for a reason and it is great at doing its job. No clouds of powder or funky smells just fresh balls.</li>
    <li> I am a big man.  6&#x27;5\\&quot; and 280. I frequently have to deal with chaffing on the inner thigh when walking as a tourist or hiking a trail.  After compression shorts (a must if you have never tried them) I looked for some additional protection.    I tried baby oil and other lanolin based products but they were way too messy.  I tried Monkey-Butt and other talc based products (talc is cheaper than Monkey-Butt and almost as good), but they tend to \\&quot;clump\\&quot; and leave a mess on the bathroom floor as well as your underclothes.    I then discovered Fresh Balls.  You need to know that Fresh Balls is not inexpensive.  You can get a small 3 oz tube for around $12.  The good news?  The container gets under the TSA&#x27;s 3.4 OZ limit for carry-on.    Apply a dab to the areas you want to keep fresh.  It goes on clean, leaves no mess, no clumping.  It also lasts a good while.  How long?  I suspect that&#x27;s a function of how much you sweat and how much wicking your underclothes provide.    The product works well for me and I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This product works just as described! Keeps all my areas clean, dry and fresh. Use it daily and keep dry and eliminate any chafing or rubbing. Thank goodness for this product. Nobody better take my Fresh Balls away!</li>
    <li> Hello. I very rarely get a chance to speak out on an issue, certainly not on a subject as personal to me as this. For several months now, I have been quite uncomfortable, the likely result of too much exercising, too much humidity, and unforgiving undergarments. Still, my \\&quot;owner\\&quot; did not seem to recognize the importance of the situation. Multiple showers, generous applications of regular powder, and even an occasional use of the \\&quot;medicated\\&quot; variety all seemed to be useless against this formidable foe. I had almost relegated myself to a few blissful minutes in the morning post-shower, when I was dry and comfortable as a cow in pasture watching the Burger King drive on by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, moments later and I would return to the hell that was my existence. I tried to communicate to my \\&quot;better half,\\&quot; intentionally getting caught in a zipper in a futile attempt to attract attention to my cause. I even considered the rarely heard these days \\&quot;nocturnal emission\\&quot; as an, albeit pleasurable. wake-up call. I didn&#x27;t go through with the plan on the naive hope I would be attended to soon. No such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then this product arrived. All I can say is that, to me, it was as if the heavens opened up and sent a personal message of love directly into my soul. Smooth application, this lotion-like product quickly turned to a powdery like substance, cool and dry to the touch. Even hours later, I remained in blissful comfort, the horrible memories of my sticky and painful past fading more and more each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I am a new pair of &amp;#&amp;#(. Happy and good-natured, I rarely lose my temper, wrapped up in an invisible lawyer of magical protection. Today, I defy my owner to place uncomfortable undergarments on me, I will him to exercise more and more, I even silently wish for increased humidity, just to test my new-found savior&#x27;s true capacity for magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read the other reviews of this product. While well written, they are, alas, drafted by one who cannot know the personal torment that was my prior life. The only way to truly understand how this product works is to hear it from the ^#*(#&#x27;s itself, and here I am. I hope my review makes clear that I love this product. It has changed my life, and in turn, my owner&#x27;s as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On behalf of us Nu*s everywhere, I thank the makers of this, and give it my highest recommendation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. S&#x27;s B&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> My husband says it works wonders at keeping the boys dry.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend asked for this after it was recommended by others. He said it works as expected for keeping the area fresh all day long.</li>
    <li> I always used powders on my shaved nuggets, and when I&#x27;m working outside, need to come in to wash and re-apply that messy stuff.  My first order of Fresh Balls arrived last week, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It&#x27;s 100+ degrees here and my junk is cool as a cuc!  Life is good!</li>
    <li> Summers and humidity are the worst time of the year for me. This stuff relieves the discomfort. It does what it says</li>
    <li> Works great to prevent chaffing on my boy friend. No more raw spots. Less ingrown hairs too. Wish they sold it locally</li>
    <li> This was a good product to use. It performed better than powders and sprays without the obvious smell. It does give your hands a semi chalky feel to them, but it can by easily rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treated area will feel great after a long work day 9-6. And if you are off to the gym afterward, you will be happy to know that the performance will continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this as a must buy if powders and sprays are not good enough.</li>
    <li> Works really could I must say.</li>
    <li> best used in the morning a shower a night dont make you ready for a morming delite . have fun</li>
    <li> I have been a Fresh Balls user for 6 months and it works great, so much better then powder. I&#x27;am a big man and it was always damp down below, not anymore, now it&#x27;s nice and dry. try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product!</li>
    <li> It does the job, keeps you sweat free for the most part. The only part that isn&#x27;t so great is every time you open the lid, there&#x27;s always dried up product waiting to fall out onto the floor. But like i said, the product inside works and is a cool idea. My nuggets are dry.</li>
    <li> read a recommendation in Men&#x27;s Health Magazine - ordered on line - been using it for a month now - the boys always smell fresh and clean - Amazing  - I highly recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;Just went on line and ordered a 6-pak, save a few $&#x27;s doing it this way</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!!! Love this product!!!!  Keeps the \\&quot;boys\\&quot; fresh and dry....no powder residue when going comando!  Much easier to use than a powder!</li>
    <li> The only reason I can&#x27;t give it five stars is, I need ample summer weather to fully test it, but so far, I am very pleased, some sweat more than others. But, this is a must for all men, great product, at the end of long day I still smell like I just got out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually excited to post this review because the product isn&#x27;t one that you go around talking about. It&#x27;s just hard to start a conversation with: \\&quot;My balls are so much drier now! You gotta try this stuff!!\\&quot; But that is the truth. I was using baby powder daily and between that awful caking that happened and the large amount of powder residue all over my bathroom, I was looking for another alternative. This product is it! It keeps me dry, it has all but eliminated that awful stench that comes from too much sweating, it makes me feel better and my wife is giving it a huge thumbs up (for various reasons, you will need to use your imagination on why she likes it). Bottom line: the stuff works. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Does everything it advertises and more.  I&#x27;m dry as the Sahara even after working out...helps out with that embarrassing need to adjust you junk every 5 min in a hot/humid climate.</li>
    <li> There is a great deal of jokes out there about this stuff, but I found something that actually WORKS!!! I rub on my inner thighs and my nut sack after I shower. It works all day long, and I don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;monkey butt\\&quot; any more. This is a great product if you ride motorcycles or work outside a lot.</li>
    <li> I was happy to see these products in the mainstream now.  Nothing worse than chaffing and baby powder was getting old.  I bought this product as well as Balla powder.  Fresh balls goes on as a wet-ish cream and eventually dries.  It has a fresh smell which is nice. Once it dries it&#x27;s as if nothing is there. One downside is when opening the cap a bunch of dried FB falls out of the tube which is annoying. The Balla powder works great and lasts all day and I much prefer it.</li>
    <li> Definitely does what it says, keeps &#x27;em a lot fresher than they would be otherwise. Would recommend to anyone, especially if you&#x27;re active.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to try this stuff although it is a bit expensive.  Well, I think it is well worth it.  Keeps you dry and smelling great.</li>
    <li> Goes on easy, and keeps you comfortable all day. Note - the powder residue will get on clothes, but washes off easily.</li>
    <li> If you work out a lot or sweat a lot you will love this product. Works just as advertised. Love it.</li>
    <li> The last thing any of us would dream of doing is dipping your boys in a bath of creamy lotion-like substance. When I first got this, I hesitated rubbing it on. I just \\&quot;sacked\\&quot; up and did it - and at first thought \\&quot;crap, this is exactly the wrong feeling I want\\&quot;...it felt greasy. Then, after a few seconds, it started to dry and MAGIC! Excellent product keeping the boys dry through tough action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Current regimen - rub thoroughly all around, use a hairdryer to quicken the drying of the lotion into powder. Then liberally apply baby powder. Then head out, ready for action.</li>
    <li> Forget baby powder, this stuff is awesome.  I was skeptical at first, but after trying it you can quickly see how the other reviews are spot on.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Better than powder, and lasts all day. If you&#x27;re a big man like myself who tends to sweat too much, this stuff is great! I am turning my friends onto this product (makes for interesting conversation after we&#x27;ve all had a few drinks).</li>
    <li> This product works good for both everyday use and before a long workout.  The product last a long time without needing to reapply throughout the day.  It also has a great smell.</li>
    <li> I use it with no problem.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s only so much I can say about this product and still get this review approved, but let&#x27;s just say you and anyone else who is fortunate enough to encounter them will appreciate Fresh Balls.</li>
    <li> This is a liquid talc product. It rubs on like a lotion that adheres to your skin, then drys quickly into a thin powder without the mess of dry powders. It smells great, and keeps you dry.</li>
    <li> dosn&#x27;t work wouldn&#x27;t recomend for use,seemed to work at first,after a couple of days just seemed it wasn&#x27;t working for me any more!</li>
    <li> I used to use baby powder all the time. This is an excellent product without the mess. The product also travels well.</li>
    <li> It works for the most part, but there is quite a lot of white residue.  Keep this in mind when applying, do not touch your clothes until you have washed your hands.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with buying this.  Keeps you fresh and dry even in the toughest of workouts.</li>
    <li> When I first heard about this product I was a bit reluctant to make the purchase.  Although not cheap this product works and is well worth the price.  I will continue to purchase this product on Amazon.  I recommend buying 3 tubes at once.</li>
    <li> I bought Fresh Balls for my sweetie, he loves it and says it works great.  That makes us both happy, happy, happy. \\&quot; Now were cookin with peanut oil\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The other reviews on here were great for this product, so I had high hopes. I was a little disappointed though, and would rather stick with Gold Bond.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Works great for summer time. Don&#x27;t use it in the winter. Wipes on wet but instantly turns into powder. Gave it as a gift to a friend of mine and he now orders his own. IF you suffer from sweaty balls during the summer this product is for you</li>
    <li> Wow , I just received this product and am way impressed . Granted I have only been using it for a couple days but I have to say . The boys stay dry , fresh and silky smooth all day and a bonus ... Zero cling factor ! I sure wish I had known about this product years ago . I highly recommend this stuff !</li>
    <li> i purchased this for a couple men in my life as a joke and a serious solution! IT REALLY WORKS! the smell isn&#x27;&#x27;t over powering its just clean smelling. my only complaint or word to the wise is that it does not last all day but it doesn&#x27;t leave residue so you can reapply as often as needed!</li>
    <li> Does it work?  Yes but it turns into a powder after it dries and will leave a residue as if it was a powder</li>
    <li> Much better than baby power, which cakes up overtime and is also bad for your body. I got all 3 of the men in my life a tube for Christmas. It lead to an interesting conversation, but was all in good fun. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and a half and it rocks! I tell every guy I know about it. I don&#x27;t want to sound too much like a tampon commercial...but, it smells good, keeps you fresh &amp; dry and the chicks dig it!</li>
    <li> I pour concrete for a living and fresh balls keeps them cool ,nonsticky and fresh all day in the heat I would never go to work with out it now</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT WORKS AS ADVERTISED AND EASY TO USE. THE PRICE A LITTLE HIGH, BUT SEEMS TO WORK BETTER THAN POWDER</li>
    <li> i dont know how to say this in a nice way so i will tip toe around it. you know the name so you know what it does. and it does it well. way better then baby powder and no mess like baby powder</li>
    <li> Very nice not to have powder all over, but the best one I have found is &amp;#34;Anti-Monkey Butt.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still sweat with this and didn&#x27;t seam to do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Was turned on to this product by a coworker. I work in a hot environment so I gave it a try.It works far better than ordinary baby powder. The boys are very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military and had a buddy recommend this product. It definitely helps. It&#x27;s kind of like weak deodorant... deodorant lasts for about eight-hours and this product works for about six.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a product like this on local pharmacy or target/walmart stores. All they hare are powders..and are messy. So I gave this a try and loved it. Not messy and it really works. Kept my area dried and smelling good during my workout or biking hours. Recommend!</li>
    <li> What can I say they are dry and i guess fresh. The talc does the trick keeping the moisture down. The green tea is a plus as it takes out anything else. So glad these guys thought up this product and hope that it sticks around.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Fantastic product. No more swamp nuts, no more bat wings. The boys stay nice and dry, comfortable all day, regardless of the temperature or humidity.</li>
    <li> Cheap and exact what was promised.</li>
    <li> Waste of Money in my opinion. Felt nice at the begning but really dosnt last. I sit at a desk all day and this stuff still didn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
    <li> Fresh Balls works really well in keeping you dry and fresh throughout the day. I usually apply it after I shower and dry off, then it stays on the rest of the day!</li>
