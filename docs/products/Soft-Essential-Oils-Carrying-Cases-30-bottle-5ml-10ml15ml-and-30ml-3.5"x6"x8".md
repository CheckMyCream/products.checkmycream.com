      <li>Quick response, well made!</li>

      <li>I just needed a simple case to fit my oils and this one worked out quite nicely.</li>
      <li>Even though these leather cases are for bottles smaller that an ounce you can fit most one ounce bottles in them but you will not be able to put as many in or just buy smaller bottles to fit in them.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>I think its worth about 10 to 15 bucks.</li>

      <li>I know they are meant as a carrying case to take out but when its full with one ounce bottles it becomes heavy and it is made good but just in case, I would only recommend this product to someone who is buying it for storing at home.ing at home.</li>
      <li>It holds 30 oils and fits them very snug.</li>
      <li>Zipper works very well.</li>
      <li>I would let anyone who is thinking of buying this item know, first it is soft and yes you can take it with you</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend getting one.</li>
      <li>I can fit the 30ml bottle in there, but I don&#x27;t think your going to fill the whole bag up with 30ml bottle, it would be a really tight squeeze.</li>
      <li>They are soft and you can stretch the spaces to fit up to a two ounce bottle in but you will lose one of the spaces unless you stick a smaller bottle next to it.</li>
      <li>I am having a hard time stretching the fabric to get them in, but I was able only after putting a couple 15 ml bottles that are really skinny and not the normal 15 ml bottles</li>
      <li>BTW,  the issue of the sagging bottom that someone reviewed, midst have been fixed cause</li>
      <li>Also the other company is selling this new design too, because the last one I bought had this same design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Item as described. Great value for the price. Helps me store my essential oils easily</li>
    <li> Just the right size for my oils</li>
    <li> 2-03-15 Looking at it and inside it it seemed the same as the ones from the other company but I noticed as I was putting more 1 oz. oils in it (trying two different brands because of size difference) I am having a hard time stretching the fabric to get them in, but I was able only after putting a couple 15 ml bottles that are really skinny and not the normal 15 ml bottles but with the case under stress. So if you need it for a combination of sizes, then I would get it. You will not have problems with smaller ones falling out on the bottom. Also the other company is selling this new design too, because the last one I bought had this same design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review&lt;br /&gt;I bought eight from another company and at the time of purchasing I notice this one was a little cheaper, so I decided to buy it. It nice for all sizes, 10 ml, 15 ml and 30 ml. The sewing goes all the way down between the oils but it does not connect on the bottom. I would let anyone who is thinking of buying this item know, first it is soft and yes you can take it with you but I think it best for storage at home. If you are looking for a case to take a lot of your essential oils with you, get the ones that have a leather-like cover with an over the shoulder strap. I have two of the over the shoulder that carries 64 bottles up to a half ounce. Even though these leather cases are for bottles smaller that an ounce you can fit most one ounce bottles in them but you will not be able to put as many in or just buy smaller bottles to fit in them. But these are nice for storing them and if they are full or mostly full you can stack them. They are soft and you can stretch the spaces to fit up to a two ounce bottle in but you will lose one of the spaces unless you stick a smaller bottle next to it. I know they are meant as a carrying case to take out but when its full with one ounce bottles it becomes heavy and it is made good but just in case, I would only recommend this product to someone who is buying it for storing at home.ing at home.</li>
    <li> Excellent case. Like it so much I am ordering one for my mom:) I have all three sizes of bottles and they fit perfect!!</li>
    <li> Fits my different sized oils as I hoped it would. I don&#x27;t have to worry about spills or bottles breaking.</li>
    <li> This came within a few days of ordering and is much nicer than I expected!  I love it and all different sizes of oils fit!  I would highly recommend getting one.</li>
    <li> Like this a LOT!  BTW,  the issue of the sagging bottom that someone reviewed, midst have been fixed cause this doesn&#x27;t do that and has a plastic bottom.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Timely shipping &amp; delivery. Perfect size carrying case to hold essential oil bottles as well as roller balls. Would do business with Plant Therapy again. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Nice case, well padded. Have put my assortment of essential oils into the case. With circle stickers on top they are easy to identify and remove from the case.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I just needed a simple case to fit my oils and this one worked out quite nicely.</li>
    <li> Love this case! Great size</li>
    <li> Nice size sections; holds 5ml through 15 ml essential oils plus up to 2ml bottles. I even have a couple of bottles with droppers attached in the case since the case is cloth and flexible.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law asked for this and was glad to get it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed! Quick response, well made!</li>
    <li> Great bag.  It has a plastic on the bottom, so when you pick it up your oils don&#x27;t fall through.  The only downside is its 24 dollar price.  That I think is a bit much, but it at least keeps my essential oils organized.  I can fit the 30ml bottle in there, but I don&#x27;t think your going to fill the whole bag up with 30ml bottle, it would be a really tight squeeze.</li>
    <li> ILOVE LOVE LOVE this bag! It holds 30 oils and fits them very snug. I wish it held more. I need another one. The price could have been better. I think its worth about 10 to 15 bucks.</li>
    <li> Excellent case.  Holds many different sizes of bottles as well as roller bottles.  Cushioned to protect the bottles.  Zipper works very well.</li>
