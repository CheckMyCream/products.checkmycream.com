    <li> divina fragancia  excelente</li>
    <li> very good seller, excellent product thanks.</li>
    <li> Excellent, would recommend</li>
    <li> excellent and very good</li>
    <li> This product did not smell like the perfume was supposed to . And it smells just water...</li>
    <li> I arrived in perfect condition my splash of victoria&#x27;s secret, I loved it and were very transparent in the purchase, thanks</li>
    <li> smells much too vanilla</li>
    <li> Must be something wrong with the bottle I received. It had almost no strength and did not smell like previous purchases from local stores.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom and sister; I also bought them the mactching lotion to go with it. Both loved the gifts, and we all agree that they smell amazing, so everyone&#x27;s very happy.</li>
    <li> This smells so good. It&#x27;s like a vanilla coconut combo. It&#x27;s nice and I can still smell it on my clothes after a while.</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO ORIGINAL</li>
    <li> product as advertised. Delivery slow but reasonable.</li>
    <li> excellent buy, very satisfied, thank you</li>
    <li> This spray is so great I love it so much and I always find myself overdosing with this spray until I start trading it. But its so great!</li>
    <li> I love how coconut smells and have always wanted a coconut scented perfume or body spray so I was excited to try this. It smells really good and if you like coconut or vanilla then you will love this. I also had a friend that had cherry blossom and peach and it smells really good too so now I will have to buy that next. I also bought vanilla lace for a friend before my actual purchase. Victoria Secret is spot on with all their scents and I don&#x27;t see how anyone could be disappointed with this purchase or any other scent by them. Can&#x27;t wait to try another scent in the future.</li>
    <li> Love how this smells...so light and tropical, just perfect for summer. I think its a nice mix of coconut and vanilla..neither one over powers the other. The scent stays on your skin all day and it just puts you in a good mood because it smells like a tropical vacation...overall a great spray :)</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrance. I get compliments every time I wear it which is everyday!!! It has a soft scent not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> It smells fantastic on me. Great product! I would buy again after I try their other scents.</li>
    <li> VERY RESPONSIBLE, EXCELLENT</li>
    <li> accordance with the purchase meets the expectations</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a excellent product and it was on time. I recommend it a lot</li>
    <li> excellent recommend wonderful</li>
    <li> This product smells great and lasts all day. The package came quickly and the product came secured.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that it would be a bit more fruity smelling, and light smelling. It&#x27;s actually quite warm and heavy smelling, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting at all from a Victoria&#x27;s Secret body mist. I guess you could say it&#x27;s more vanilla smelling than coconut smelling. However with that said, it does smell pretty nice. I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I&#x27;d hoped it would be lighter and fruitier. So when buying this, keep in mind that it&#x27;s more of a warm vanilla smelling perfume than a coconut scented body mist. Oh, and the scent does last a while.</li>
    <li> I loved it it was a perfume that did not bother my asthma.I will get another one after this runs out.  ihad so many people that loved the smell and asked what is was, i told them and told them where to get it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, thank you.</li>
    <li> great value for the dollar</li>
    <li> excelente producto...........</li>
    <li> It was not disclosed that there&#x27;s vanilla in this fragrance;I love coconut but the scent of vanilla makes me nauseous,so I had to give it to my daughter.The quality was fine</li>
    <li> good seller, I recommend the article came atiempo 100% recommended</li>
    <li> The product came exactly which as indicated specifications</li>
    <li> fair ! this is for my grand kid so i did not know the answer for that. but my  teenager grand kid will appreciate this, i sure !</li>
    <li> Smells great, but the nozzle was broken, it doesn&#x27;t spray it drips out.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing, and it last too much on the skin.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it!</li>
