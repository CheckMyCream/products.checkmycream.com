      <li>wish I could say I love everything about this polish</li>
      <li>in all, I love, love, love this polish.</li>
      <li>The product itself is just okay.</li>
      <li>I had got gel on top but it made it crack ( happens to any nail polish not just yours )</li>
      <li>Love this polish.  </li>
      <li>Very cool polish, love the colors.  </li>
      <li>stuff is amazing, so beautiful and as long as you let it set and do its thing</li>
      <li>Color is nice but it chips too quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>very cool...</li>
      <li>It was gorgeous straight away, and this is still my go to when I can&#x27;t decide on a color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This polish is stunning, shifting from a rich cerulean to teal to fuschia to violet with just a twitch of the finger.</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been my experience that men typically don&#x27;t pay attention to nail polish, but this color is soooo amazing that men have been complementing me on my nails!!!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this polish so very much!</li>
      <li>This polish was my very first foray into the world of &amp;#34;indie&amp;#34; polishes, and I could not have had a better introduction.</li>
      <li>have fun and enjoy this polish!</li>
      <li>Very eye catching.</li>
      <li>Polish goes on smooth and shiny.  </li>
      <li>The color changes with the movement of the fingers and light...</li>
      <li>I had a bottle from Sally Hansen that looked almost as good as this when I was a kid, but I could never use it because it never dried enough.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Looks best over black, dries relatively quickly.</li>
      <li>This may become my new favorite color!</li>
      <li>That was excellent coverage the nail polish dried quickly.</li>
      <li>I was really excited about this nail polish when I ordered it.</li>
      <li>Beautiful shade-shifiting color; however, in order to get it opaque as shown in the picture, either four coats must be applied or first two coats of purple or blue, then two coats of this color.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>So cool.</li>
      <li>so cool</li>
      <li>Its watery, so you need several coats to see a good shade.</li>
      <li>Mine turned out more blue than multicolored but its still pretty spectacular in the light.</li>
      <li>I finally used the nail polish, I loved it.</li>
      <li>Different is good.</li>
      <li>The only thing I liked was the color and how it does reflect light as shown.</li>
      <li>Polish peels off too quickly, even with just two coats.</li>
      <li>but it still seems to ware away quickly.</li>
      <li>But still very pretty.</li>
      <li>it came out a super pretty!</li>
      <li>The seller was kind enough to give me a full refund.</li>
      <li>Its so pretty!</li>
      <li>Worth the price</li>
      <li>The shifting color is fun.</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I put the nail polish right over it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Worked Out Out Great ! As you Can see my Crusty Nails before then After. I went to The salon and got a Regular Full set and brong the Nail polish with me. I had got gel on top but it made it crack ( happens to any nail polish not just yours ) so I advise regular clear nail polish on top .The Lady that usually do my nails wanted to buy it off me lol so I&#x27;ll defiantly will be ordering again !</li>
    <li> Amazingly beautiful! Definitely need to use a base coat. I used black. Very eye catching.</li>
    <li> Very cool polish, love the colors.  The only thing is the polish does not last too long.  I always use a top coat but it still seems to ware away quickly.</li>
    <li> Love the color. I will be ordering more. Its different than just one color or designs on my nails.</li>
    <li> I finally used the nail polish, I loved it. 😊 my gel manicure had been on for about a month I put the nail polish right over it it took three coats to cover the gel manicure. That was excellent coverage the nail polish dried quickly. The nail polish also last for over two weeks, l didn&#x27;t even apply a top coat. It was easy to apply.  All you do is apply it like any other nail polish..The nail polish was packed very well in it was wrapped in bubble paper and delivered in a sturdy box. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Color is nice but it chips too quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> Like the color...my niece really liked it</li>
    <li> It is thin and you do NEED a black bass coat. If you spend the extra time on yourself you will be rewarded. Product is better then advertised if used properly. I will buy more of this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been my experience that men typically don&#x27;t pay attention to nail polish, but this color is soooo amazing that men have been complementing me on my nails!!!  I wear tips so having some length gives it a more dramatic effect. You have to see it for yourself, but TRUST you&#x27;re gonna love it!!</li>
    <li> The color changes with the movement of the fingers and light...very cool...I was glad that it wasn&#x27;t to out there in color, afraid it would be more for a teen, but its not. I put a solid color on first so I would need so many coats of this, and it worked out great.</li>
    <li> I just tried this. First by using a dark color as the base then the color on top and I couldn&#x27;t get over how easy this was to get such fun effects! I also tried just applying a clear base and then 2 coats of this shade shifter on top. It still worked and to my eye it came out better! This may become my new favorite color!</li>
    <li> Beautiful shade-shifiting color; however, in order to get it opaque as shown in the picture, either four coats must be applied or first two coats of purple or blue, then two coats of this color.</li>
    <li> Definitely a shade shifter polish! I get so many compliments when I wear this color. I definitely recommended it to my friends!</li>
    <li> This picture doesn&#x27;t do the actual color and justice. So beautiful!</li>
    <li> But still very pretty. Mine turned out more blue than multicolored but its still pretty spectacular in the light. Worth the price</li>
    <li> This nail polish lasts a long time and it&#x27;s so fun!  I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> I hate that I&#x27;m paying this much! Its watery, so you need several coats to see a good shade. I only used it a couple times and its half gone! What a waist! Nice color tho.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this nail polish when I ordered it. However, as I applied it I was disappointed. It was very very thin. The first coat which I applied in a normal coat \\&quot;thickness\\&quot; was completely see through. (So was the second coat.) I had to glob on the 3rd and 4th coat to get any real color pay off. All the coats completely dried but within 12 hrs they were peeling. I reapplied and finally got the polish to stay on but continued to have major issues with chipping. On my second try, I lost count of how many coats of polish I applied to get the type of color payoff that the polish shows on its page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say I love everything about this polish but unfortunately I do not. The only thing I liked was the color and how it does reflect light as shown. It went from being all blue to all purple and all maroon. It was very lovely. It&#x27;s just impractical to apply (at least for me). It&#x27;s too thin. The seller was kind enough to give me a full refund. I would recommend the polish for the color (I adored it) but beware you will spend a lot of time retouching your nails.</li>
    <li> Like a dupe of Sally Hansen Garnet Lapis, but even better, less frosty (also similar to HITS Mari Moon Artsy, Ludurena Flash, Ozotic 506 but at far better prices.) Looks best over black, dries relatively quickly. I absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this polish so very much! The colors are just GORGEOUS!  This is the BEST shifting of color that I have ever seen!</li>
    <li> Its so pretty! I love layering it over purple polish. It really brings out the cool colors.</li>
    <li> This polish is incredible.  I wore two coats of it over a black base and it looks exactly like the picture here.  Polishes like this are usually very sheer.  If you don&#x27;t have black, wear this over the darkest color you have.  You won&#x27;t regret it.  I was so distracted by my nails with this color on, and it lasted for four days or so.</li>
    <li> Multichrome Nail so cool i love it so much, looking so good on the nail you should to try it..!!</li>
    <li> it was just what i wanted.  beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was just what wanted Its beautiful</li>
    <li> The color really does shift and it looks great. I always get compliments and questions when I wear this color. Just make sure to use thin coats -  2 or 3 and Seche Vite as the final coat to make it dry quickly (Seche Vite really works! See my review of it).</li>
    <li> I had to wear 2 coats of black nail polish then apply this color on top.&lt;br /&gt;My neighbor loved the color and asked me about it. :-)</li>
    <li> Pretty color, but no shade shifting.</li>
    <li> Love it! Took 3 coats but next time I&#x27;ll just use a dark base coat. I just did my nails today, so in a few days I&#x27;ll update my review, so far though it&#x27;s psychedelic! :)</li>
    <li> Came quicker than expected.  But this polish is gorgeous!  Dries quick if you do thin layers and let each dry completely.  Takes two coates if you don&#x27;t use a bottom solid color.  Mainly blue in direct sunlight if your looking straight at it but as you move you see purple at at times a hint of gold.  The have another color changing polish and I&#x27;m definetly getting it!  I&#x27;m a big fan now!</li>
    <li> Picture doesn&#x27;t do justice. I absolutely love this color! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Different is good. I love this nail polish! It dries quickly and goes on smoothly. The shifting color is fun. I have gotten several compliments on this polish, along with several people asking where to get it.</li>
    <li> This polish looks exactly like the photo, however it seemed the main color was the blue - the purple showed up strongly, but only in certain light. I would have given this 5 stars if the purple was the predominant color. But overall, I like it.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery! Had it within 2 days. The product itself is just okay. Looks really nice, but it took 4 coats and it&#x27;s still a bit see through.</li>
    <li> Love this polish.  Beautiful color and good coverage.  With a top coat to guard against chipping this wears a long time.  The color spectrum is mostly blue and purple.  Shows a rosy pink color at certain angles.  Polish goes on smooth and shiny.  Looks best with two coats.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I got a lot of compliments!</li>
    <li> I love this polish.  The colors change and shift like it claims.  It wears well.  I receive many compliments when I wear it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> When I put on the first coat of this polish I was skeptical--it looked thin, and I thought I would be putting on ten more coats to get full coverage.  One coat later, it looked just like the photo.  I didn&#x27;t even use it over black--just two coats of the polish over a clear base.  I put a couple small decals on over it and finished with a quick-dry top coat (SV),  Still, it took around 5 hours to dry enough to function, and that was after I got tired of waiting and dunked my nails in ice water.  The color is so awesome that it was worth the wait!  It&#x27;s everything from blue to purple to copper depending on the light.  Looking forward to trying a chunky holo, next.</li>
    <li> This stuff is gorgeous. I had a bottle from Sally Hansen that looked almost as good as this when I was a kid, but I could never use it because it never dried enough.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing, so beautiful and as long as you let it set and do its thing it looks like gasoline on asphalt. So cool.</li>
    <li> This polish is transparent even after multiple coats. I bought it to make resin jewelry and I have found it totally useless.</li>
    <li> Very watery. Takes about 4 coats before you get the results shown on picture. Polish peels off too quickly, even with just two coats.</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments! Used with a dark base coat, two coats of this polish and a top coat.  One week, no chipping! Love the way it changes color. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice coverage. Thought I&#x27;d get more color/shade shifting. I like it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping color looks great Thanks Ann</li>
    <li> Is it blue? Is it purple? Is it green? It&#x27;s all the colors! Completely stunning. It required 4 coats to get a good finish but was worth it. I have got so many compliments on it</li>
    <li> i just received my nail polish today. i couldn&#x27;t wait to try it! i had on a red polish already and didnt want to change it. i am so glad i didn&#x27;t. it came out a super pretty! with such a unique color i love to experiment and mix base colors. have fun and enjoy this polish! i loved it so much a already ordered the green one also!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very distracting because I&#x27;m always playing with my nails to see the color change. It&#x27;s so pretty, but maybe not for someone with a very short attention span :)</li>
    <li> This polish is stunning, shifting from a rich cerulean to teal to fuschia to violet with just a twitch of the finger. I&#x27;ve received more compliments on this polish than any other multichrome I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
    <li> It works very well I just wish good at painting my own nails</li>
    <li> This truly looks just like it does in the picture,  I think this is my all time favorite color of nail polish!</li>
    <li> This took my nails to the next level. I painted them a blue-green base and then put one coat of this on top, now my nails alternate between a shimmering blue-green and purple-pink and they are GORGEOUS! Can&#x27;t wait to experiment with more color bases!</li>
    <li> This polish was my very first foray into the world of &amp;#34;indie&amp;#34; polishes, and I could not have had a better introduction. A lot of the commenters seem to be complaining about how many coats it took to get the full effect, and I cannot speak to that as I followed the maker&#x27;s advice and used one coat of black polish (Wet &amp; Wild &amp;#34;Black Creme&amp;#34;, $.99) prior to applying the Shade Shifter. It was gorgeous straight away, and this is still my go to when I can&#x27;t decide on a color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice much chipping or tip wear, but I use CND&#x27;s Stickey and Air Dry for base and top coats, so that might have something to do with the longevity of my manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love, love, love this polish. Well worth the money I spent.</li>
    <li> Fast shippping. So beautiful in various lighting and long lasting. Works best with a dark base coat. Buying some for my daughter and will recommend to others! Love KB Shimmer polish! :-)</li>
    <li> awesome nail polish that changes colors!!! it needs three coats to do it justice (and don&#x27;t forget the top coat for protection), or at least two thick coats over a dark color to really do it justice - the first coat is super thin, but if you apply it properly, it comes out great! seriously can&#x27;t recommend enough!</li>
    <li> very thin takes multiple coats</li>
    <li> I love this nail Polish. If you buff your nails as instructed you get a very nice smooth finish.  It is a beautiful color!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this polish!!</li>
    <li> It is a very pretty nail polish even when your to lazy to remove the previous leftover nail polish it goes on smooth. I had red nail polish on my toes and it brought out the red in this multichrome polish just a little bit when I put it over the old polish.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptionally lovely polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It needs at least three layers to look like the photo, but that&#x27;s fine. Just let each one dry thoroughly before you add the next one.</li>
