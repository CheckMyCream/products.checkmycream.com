### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Love-the perfect color for me</li>
      <li>great make up!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Really great look.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice creamy texture, beautiful color, and very easy to apply without the drying effect that powder shadows have.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THEM!</li>
      <li>These sticks are great because you have a color and accent plus you can use easily to line bottom of eyes also.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing eyeshadow stick.  </li>
      <li>and it has a nice shine without looking like night time/party make up.  </li>
      <li>Texture is very smooth and not cakey.</li>
      <li>The eye shadow don&#x27;t really go on , it is very light, not the seller fault Almay the maker needs to make it more darker.</li>
      <li>I just color the bottom of my eyes with the darker color, and the top of my eyes with the lighter one.  </li>
      <li>I will need to experiment more with blending the colors.</li>
      <li>This company discontinued my favorite eyeshadow, which included these two colors.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, if you&#x27;re really persistent and want to use it, I would recommend using your finger to apply.</li>
      <li>This lasts well in my make-up bag, and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>But the crayons break too easily.</li>
      <li>But if you have time to add layers and play around this may be something you enjoy.</li>
      <li>Good for young ladies experimenting whom you wouldn&#x27;t want it to show up well on, but not for adults.</li>
      <li>My primary complain about this is that the coverage is very translucent and I was hoping for something a bit more opaque.</li>
      <li>The colors are very light, almost not visible unless you really layer it on.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really quick and easy… only takes about 20 seconds per eye, and it looks better than any combination that I could ever come up with on my own.  </li>
      <li>I have green eyes, but I bought all of the colors and all of the primers because it is a fun and fast way to mix and match coordinating colors to look your very best.</li>
      <li>Love the ease of this product, glides on easily and like that it is made for specific eye color, but the stick came out and it broke.  </li>
      <li>they are fun to play with!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Was exactly as described and shipped quickly</li>
      <li>so I believe in their good quality but this particular stick will be shipped back to the manufacture today!</li>
      <li>Easy to use which is a big deal for me as I wanted something that goes on quickly</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t even use this from the first moment it arrived.</li>
      <li>I can say once on the colors complimented my hazel-green eyes very well.</li>
      <li>so I just use the pink side mostly to add a touch of color to my lids.</li>
      <li>It is gentle to my eyes - some brands irritate my eyes.</li>
      <li>However it doesn&#x27;t deposit much pigment</li>
      <li>Great for travel because these sticks and primers that go along with them take up less room in the makeup bag than other palette type shadows.</li>
      <li>but the other side seems to always not go on smoothly.</li>
      <li>The colors are very soft also.</li>
      <li>last all day as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes and are easy to apply once you get the hang of it.</li>
      <li>Nice colors, but very hard to apply.</li>
      <li>I could swipe and blend on the go as I&#x27;m a busy mom.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the type of person who is not very great with make-up, and that is why I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It is hard to find; so, if you do locate one, I urge you to buy it right away because it may be a discontinued color!</li>
      <li>Upon first use, it was so hard and dry that the whole tip cracked off on my eyelid.</li>
      <li>maybe I move it around in my purse too much or something… but they always crumble and make a mess.  </li>

    <li> I do like the color combo on this stick.  However it doesn&#x27;t deposit much pigment and you&#x27;ve got to be careful that the color sticks don&#x27;t fall out.  It is gentle to my eyes - some brands irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> Easy to use which is a big deal for me as I wanted something that goes on quickly and it has a nice shine without looking like night time/party make up.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing eyeshadow stick.  It has a very nice creamy texture, beautiful color, and very easy to apply without the drying effect that powder shadows have.  It is hard to find; so, if you do locate one, I urge you to buy it right away because it may be a discontinued color!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use this from the first moment it arrived. The eyeshadow had crumbled. I tried squishing it back together but when I tried to use it it just crumbled again.</li>
    <li> I saw this on sale at the store so I had to try it- I just adore these color sticks. I am not a make up person, but since I purchased this stick I am no longer intimidated by eye shadows! I bought one of every eye color- they are fun to play with!&lt;br /&gt;They last all day as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes and are easy to apply once you get the hang of it. LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> I like the ease of this makeup, just roll and go! I&#x27;m not good at doing make up so I just use the pink side mostly to add a touch of color to my lids. I will need to experiment more with blending the colors. great make up!</li>
    <li> Thank you seller. The eye shadow don&#x27;t really go on , it is very light, not the seller fault Almay the maker needs to make it more darker.</li>
    <li> Really great look. Colors stay on all day. Texture is very smooth and not cakey. But the crayons break too easily. My initial shipment came broken so I had to order a replacement.</li>
    <li> Nice colors, but very hard to apply. The only way to get the shadow to go on enough where you can see it is to press really hard - and who wants to do that to their poor eyes? To be fair, if you&#x27;re really persistent and want to use it, I would recommend using your finger to apply. Otherwise, look elsewhere for an easier product to use.</li>
    <li> will never use powder shadow again!!!!</li>
    <li> These sticks are great because you have a color and accent plus you can use easily to line bottom of eyes also. Great for travel because these sticks and primers that go along with them take up less room in the makeup bag than other palette type shadows. I have green eyes, but I bought all of the colors and all of the primers because it is a fun and fast way to mix and match coordinating colors to look your very best.</li>
    <li> but the other side seems to always not go on smoothly. I apply it to the inside half of my upper and lower eye. I thought maybe it was from the eye cream I apply but it does it even without apply anything at all.</li>
    <li> Does not apply with depth of color, tried several times, trashed it, not worth returning, would not order this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who is not very great with make-up, and that is why I love this product.  They did the work for me.  I just color the bottom of my eyes with the darker color, and the top of my eyes with the lighter one.  It&#x27;s really quick and easy… only takes about 20 seconds per eye, and it looks better than any combination that I could ever come up with on my own.  I also like it because powder eye shadows break up in my make-up bag…. maybe I move it around in my purse too much or something… but they always crumble and make a mess.  This lasts well in my make-up bag, and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This company discontinued my favorite eyeshadow, which included these two colors.  I thought this would be an alternative... it&#x27;s not.  The colors are very light, almost not visible unless you really layer it on.  Good for young ladies experimenting whom you wouldn&#x27;t want it to show up well on, but not for adults.</li>
    <li> Highly disappointed in this eye shadow. Upon first use, it was so hard and dry that the whole tip cracked off on my eyelid. Was not smooth or shimmery as promised and I have used several Almay products so I believe in their good quality but this particular stick will be shipped back to the manufacture today!</li>
    <li> Love-the perfect color for me</li>
    <li> My primary complain about this is that the coverage is very translucent and I was hoping for something a bit more opaque. How that will work for you is dependent on your situation. I wanted denser color I could swipe and blend on the go as I&#x27;m a busy mom. But if you have time to add layers and play around this may be something you enjoy. I can say once on the colors complimented my hazel-green eyes very well.</li>
    <li> Was exactly as described and shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Love the ease of this product, glides on easily and like that it is made for specific eye color, but the stick came out and it broke.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it does bring out the green in my eyes. The colors are very soft also.</li>
