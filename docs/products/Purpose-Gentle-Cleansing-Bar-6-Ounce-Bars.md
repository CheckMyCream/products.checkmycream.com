      <li>My skin is very sensitive, and this soap is gentle and cleans very well.  </li>
      <li>I am much older, and my skin is now part oily part normal; Purpose BAR soap still keeps my skin clean and clear, not dry.  </li>

    <li> The Subscribe and Save + 15% savings, is a great way to buy a product such as Purpose Soap that is used daily; in our house by two people. It use to be just for cleansing the face and shaving but now we are using it for the entire body; it was recommended by my Dermatologist many years ago. Anyone of any age that has any skin problems would benefit from using this soap, it cleanses and rinses great; but does not dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap almost every day for the last 20 years.  My skin is very sensitive, and this soap is gentle and cleans very well.  Also, I am sensitive to artificial fragrances, and the smell of this soap does not bother me.  I have tried other soaps from time to time, but I always come back to this one.  I recommend it even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>

    <li> I was so happy to find this on here! I&#x27;ve been using this face soap for over 20 years and can not find the bar soap in any stores anymore, only the liquid which doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the soap itself, I ALWAYS come back to this. I stray every now and then to try the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\&quot; thing advertised but I usually find my skin dry and not reacting well to other products. I had acne as a teen and my dermatologist highly recomended it. It never leaves your face feeling stripped dry or anything. Again so glad I can still get it on here, way to go Amazon!</li>
    <li> This soap is the best for anyone&#x27;s face.  Really cleans out the dirt and is gentle to your face.&lt;br /&gt;Great for teens too, no more pimples.</li>
    <li> Never dry or oily. I &#x27;ve used this for the past 8 years with great results. I recommend it to my patients. I wish more stores carried it, but Amazon does.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap since I was 40. My skin was oily. I am much older, and my skin is now part oily part normal; Purpose BAR soap still keeps my skin clean and clear, not dry.  This year, I developed terrible milia (tiny bumps) on both cheeks when I started using Cerave gentle skin cleanser. My friends noticed the bumps. I went back to Purpose BAR soap and after TWO days, the milia cleared! Reading the low-rating reviews for Cerave, I learnt from a reviewer that the ingredient glycerin causes milia. Purpose BAR soap has glycerin listed as a 4th ingredient, and Cerave lists Glycerin as 2nd ingredient. I now use a face moisturizing cream with little or no glycerin after washing. So, if your skin is normal, oily or semi oily, or milia prone, use this bar soap.The LIQUID Purpose gentle cleanser wash has ingredients different from those of the Purpose bar soap. I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> The Purpose cleansing bar is gentle to the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and rinses very easily.  I use it on face and body.</li>
    <li> I use this as my cleansing bar.  It not only does not leave a film on my self, it also doesn&#x27;t leave much of a film on the tub after I shower,so I don&#x27;t need to clean the tub as often</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this product for some time.  Placing a standing order in the Subscribe &amp; Save program is the way to go...I never run out.  I have sensitive skin.  The product is gentle on my skin and lathers well.  Each order, I gift a couple of bars to my daughter.  She loves it too!</li>
    <li> A couple years ago, I used this soap with great results!  I think it helped w/ my moderate acne.&lt;br /&gt;I just went back to this soap a few days ago, and I tell you...I wish I hadn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;My face is horribly dry, it hurts!  I have dry patches &amp; irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I still believe it helps calm acne, but I don&#x27;t want to go through this discomfort anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Neutrogena&#x27;s purifying facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> Best for sensitive skin. I use this on my face &amp; keep reordering as doesn&#x27;t dry it out &amp; leaves skin fresh &amp; clean-feeling</li>
    <li> After suffering through many so called \\&quot;mild, non-irritating\\&quot; face washes, my dermatologist recommended PURPOSE and I haven&#x27;t looked back.  I also use Retin-A  and this soap works very well on super sensitive skin.  Great lather, clean feeling afterward.  My local pharmacy no longer carries PURPOSE, so I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon!  Going on 15+ years and I hope I can continue to find Purpose for at least another 15!</li>
    <li> This is a product I have been using for years. I have alway had acne problems so the cleansing bar is great.</li>
    <li> Because it is pure soap, and is gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using dove for my face, and the doctor suggested this because dove has moisturizers which can clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this for my face. Though (as expected) this one does dry my face out a lot. So, I have to be careful about the lotion I choose to apply afterwards.</li>
    <li> Purpose soap was recommended to me by my dermatologist about 20 years ago. It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your skin. I like that it also has no fragrance.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, but lathers well and leaves you feeling clean!  Some soaps that are very fragrant dry skin or are not preferred by hubby.  We can both use purpose!</li>
    <li> Back in 2001 I used this soap by accident at my gfs house. ( i thought it was dial) I noticed immediately how great my skin felt after drying off. It cleared my face up so smooth i have used it everyday since.  I only use it for my face because its not as cheap as regular soap but it will last me a few months. If your tired of using oxy pads. Or facial cleansers that dry out your skin. Try this. It worked for me.</li>
    <li> Dried out my skin and caused major breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. My doctor recommended Purpose cleansing bar years ago and I have been using it as my bath soap ever sense. When I try anything else my skin cries out to bring back the Purpose!</li>
    <li> I started using Purpose as a teenager when my dermatologist recommended it.  It wasn&#x27;t just the bad acne, but I was getting my pores blocked so badly I was getting a few cysts forming under my skin.  It was cleaning diligently, but I was using other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I switched to Purpose and never went back.  My skin got better and the cysts never returned.  It&#x27;s a plain, simple bar.  No perfumes, no fancy dyes.  It&#x27;s just good soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using it for about 30 years now and have never switched.  It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m afraid my skin will go bad again.  It&#x27;s just that Purpose has never given me any reason to switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plain, simple, works.</li>
    <li> On a dermatologist&#x27;s advice, I have used nothing but Purpose soap with a terry cloth washcloth on my face for years.  The result for me is happy skin.</li>
