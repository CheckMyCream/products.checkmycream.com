      <li>not worth the money, barely gets hot from the first time i plugged it in.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this! It gets nice and hot and fast. The plates are nice and it smooths my hair really nicely.  It&#x27;s also very comfortable in my hand, I like the smooth texture on it. The only thing I wish it had was an auto shut off function.</li>
    <li> LOVE this hair straightener!  It has everything I was looking for - adjustable heat setting ( it gets HOT!) retractable cord, swivel cord base and pretty color (I got the metallic purple).  I have naturally straight hair but when I sleep on it It gets so crazy creased and &amp;#34;wanged&amp;#34; out that I need to straighten it every morning.  It takes only 1-2 passes to straighten each section of my hair and I swear my hair is shinier afterwards.  I really can&#x27;t think of any negatives with this product.  I&#x27;m glad I chose this straightener and the best part is that it was 1/2 the price of the more popular brands!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is made of sturdy materials and works better than the straightener I bought at the mall for $119. The straightener I received, heats up to 500 degrees, according to the information provided with the product as well as the Amazon add, but looks the same as the one listed here with 470 degree capability.</li>
    <li> I have used it only twice because I just bought it but it heats up good.... Hope it stays like that forever,. And the delivery was on time</li>
    <li> Great product! Evenly distributes the heat throughout and heats up quickly. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boss for her birthday and she loved it. Would rate 5 if the box wasn&#x27;t damaged. That was the only thing that disappointed me. There were dents and scratches on the box.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron. I use to have a chi brand iron that cost me three times as much. The CHI also left my hair dry and smelling burnt. With my Bebella iron I have soft hair that last all day. My hair is naturally curly I should say kinky and it usually takes me an hour to straighten my hair after I wash it but with this iron it only takes me 20 minutes!</li>
    <li> I had gotten a one time offer at a stand in the mall saying I can get 2 for the price of one &amp; a lifetime warranty which was $100 total, pretty amazing to me. I loved the softness it left in my hair. But instead I decided to research it online and found it here for only $15 and it works exactly the same!!! Sure maybe I don&#x27;t get a lifetime warranty but at the price it&#x27;s at after two year I do not mind buying a new one and a different color!(:&lt;br /&gt;The color variations are great and it also curls neatly if you get the hang of it. I love it! Thank you:)</li>
    <li> When I received the flat irons they were broken</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s made my hair feel so soft since using it!</li>
    <li> not worth the money, barely gets hot from the first time i plugged it in.</li>

    <li> The color is so pretty!! It get really hot and work great for $19 dollars its great becaause they are very exspensive at the mall!</li>
    <li> Amazing deal for the product! My Chi hair straightener jist went out and I replaced it with this. Great product! High heat and works great with thick hair.</li>
    <li> My old Andis for three years still better than this,,, really I&#x27;m serious</li>
    <li> Love it! I paid a lot of money for my last straightener &amp; was heart broken when it finally died, this 1 is great at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughters and they LOVE IT!!!!  Gets really hot and definitely is a single pass.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I dropped my other flat iron and it broke.  Now, my mom bought that iron and she paid about $100 for it and I though it was great.  I have to say this iron surpasses that by far.  It gets very hot, does not pull my hair out, and gets my hair really straight (which I like).  Very Satisfied!!!!! Would definitely recommend!!!</li>
