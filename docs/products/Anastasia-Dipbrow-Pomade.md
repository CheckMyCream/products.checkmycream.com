      <li>Amazon has the best price and various colors.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to initially dab your brush in and then smudge it on the inside of the cap and apply from that.</li>
      <li>but you just want to make them look more put together, filled in, and better defined</li>
      <li>Again, what works for me won&#x27;t work for every single person, you need to tinker around with this stuff a bit to find how it best works for you.</li>

      <li>I didn&#x27;t bother with pencils any more after dying my hair blonde for many, many ears.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m incredibly happy with this product and think it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>

      <li>It applies very easily, and looks natural.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t already tried this product, you should.  A brow color and wax combined.  Stores are continually sold out.  A little bit goes a long way.  Make sure you also purchase the Anastasia Large Duo Brush #12.</li>
    <li> Finally, a brow product that stays on all day long!  Subtle, yet defining, and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Just as described. This will last me forever since the tiniest bit goes a long way. Auburn color is perfect and buildable in case your have very dark auburn hair.</li>
    <li> I love this pomade. It&#x27;s perfect to my brows, help me to define the perfect form to my brows. i recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this pomade. I have very dark brown eyebrows, but bought chocolate. It still looks amazing. It doesn&#x27;t smear, or smudge. It applies very easily, and looks natural. My only con was the price is very high for such a tiny container.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my red hair, it&#x27;s so smooth and glides right on my brows. Shipping faster that expected.  Great product and GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> Excellent for filling in the eyebrows.  I really love his!</li>
    <li> This product was a bit too orange. There is a bit of a learning curve to use it. I looked for, and found, instructions on you tube. It is usable, better than too dark browns.</li>
    <li> Need to use very little...could be a bit thicker formula but works well and color is good</li>
    <li> love this stuff! Lives up to its hype, and the little pot looks like it will last forever.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Best brow product I have ever discovered. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> A little more red-ish than I expected, but a nice color.</li>
    <li> Auburn is perfect for my henna dyed auburn hair. Matches perfectly, fills in my sparse brows, and makes me feel pretty lol</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these because it was hard to match the color of my dark brown eyebrows.  I first got Med. Brown, which was much too dark, then Taupe, which was too light, then soft brown, which was perfect.  After The first few days it was great but now after using it everyday for 3 weeks, the powder/cream in the jar is flaky and doesn&#x27;t stay on after I shower, as it use too.  NOT happy with the flaky clumps it has turned into.  Seems the longer I use it the worse the clumping gets in the jar!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Auburn color. It appears auburn in the pot but goes on almost charcoal!  I have very patchy eyebrows and it was my understanding that this product was sweat-proof. In the areas where my eyebrows do not have hair, this product wiped right off, even after a few hours of wear.  I wasn&#x27;t sweating at all either.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, its the perfect eyebrow cream that dries and doesn&#x27;t&#x27; smudge. You apply it with a brush and you get great eyebrows!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a natural redhead, and my eyebrows are blonde aka invisible! penciling some of this in with a brush on my brows makes them pop like no one&#x27;s buisness. looks natural and great! love these pot.</li>
    <li> so useful&lt;br /&gt;thank u</li>
    <li> good and nice nature color</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m redhead so this is the best color I could ask for... It&#x27;s an amazing product! I highly recommend the dipbrow pomade.</li>
    <li> REMEMBER: A little goes a long way! This pomade is incredibly concentrated and if you&#x27;re not mindful of how much you&#x27;re using you could end up looking like you&#x27;re wearing shoe polish. Little dabs and stokes. That&#x27;s all you need. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> NICE brow dip.  Stays put until I take it off.</li>
    <li> My all new fav. My friend like it too so I ordered one for her.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are in bad shape from hypothyroidism, lost most of the hairs.  So this really helps build up what I have and looks great!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I wish this came in a slightly redder shade, but I love this product and use it every day.  Easy to put on once you get the hang of the brush.  I get compliments on my eyebrows frequently.</li>
    <li> Creamy and easy to apply!</li>
    <li> This will last me YEARS. A little bit goes a long way and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> As previous reviewers mention, it seems like a high price to pay for eyebrow filler. TRUST ME ITS NOT. The amount you use per day versus the amount that is in this little jar, it will last 10 years easily. I would buy more in a heartbeat if I needed more. It lasts and lasts and I found very easy to apply, taking into consideration others reviews that it can go on heavy. I can make my brows intense or very natural looking with the brush and technique for application. You can&#x27;t get this with other brow powders or liners. And it stays...did I mention it stays on. Have oily skin, and when I get flushes/sweats, my brows start the process. Normally I would end up looking like a freak with my brows smeared all over and not even knowing it. Now they are in place pretty much even through a soaking downpour. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> This has been the best eye brow filling makeup I&#x27;ve ever used. Definitely recommend this product. It lasts a very long time, does not wipe off. So you don&#x27;t have to worry about your eyebrows still being in tact after a long day at work. The product itself will last a long long time, you only need to use very little.</li>
    <li> Best product ever made. Will last forever. Is amazing!! Stays all day and is easy to apply with angled brush and spoolie</li>
    <li> I bought the \\&quot;Brow Genius Kit\\&quot; maybe 8 months ago but soon realized I couldn&#x27;t use it all the time, due to it being complicated to get the mixture just right or it being too dark. My friend swore by this pomade and said \\&quot;Seriously, it&#x27;s super easy!\\&quot;. I was a little skeptical, due to the last purchase. My mind is blown! It literally took less than a minute for both brows, versus the 5+ minutes using a pressed powder (Mac) and an angled brush.    I&#x27;m never changing back.</li>
    <li> I still use my eyebrow pencil before I use the pomade. The pencil helps give me a base of color and shape, and then I use the pomade to enhance it. The pomade really makes your eyebrows pop, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it. Application of the pomade takes a little more time than just a brow gel, maybe a minute per brow. The color stays in place mostly, but the pomade does not keep the hair in place like a gel will. The auburn is suitable for my light/medium brown hair, and looks good when I dye my hair red as well. The product will last forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this being great but didn&#x27;t want to make any assumptions until I bought it and I absolutely LOVE this. It&#x27;s long wear, it&#x27;s worth the price, and it looks great. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I have hypothyroid so my eyebrows do not grow on the ends so I have to fill them in. I had previously been using bareminerals brow powder but they discontinued it.&lt;br /&gt;I am so please with this product - I recently darkened my hair and bought the dark brown pomade as well.&lt;br /&gt;These pots will last forever! I use a brow liner brush and swirl it in the pomade cap after dipping so that it appears more natural when applying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different eyebrow powders, from minerals to elf, mirrello and so on!!!! Non are as great like this one totally recommend it if you want something easy to apply and easy to work through you gotta buy this one!!!!! Can&#x27;t live without it Auburn is the color I purchased and I have a light brown hair color. üòç</li>
    <li> Good seller&lt;br /&gt;And good product</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best product for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Best brow product hands down! Very durable &amp; you only need a tiny bit!! Definitely worth the $18!!!! I&#x27;ll be getting another color as well! :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE. THIS. STUFF. I can guarantee if you don&#x27;t like it, it means you&#x27;re not using it properly or in a way that suits your particular eyebrows and face, because this stuff can and will work fabulously on everyone.    First point: At first I was iffy about the product because it was too creamy and applied way too heavily. For some background info, I have dark brown hair and even darker, cool-toned, almost black eyebrows that are naturally thick and I&#x27;m quite pale (I&#x27;m in the shade Dark Brown-- you don&#x27;t need Ebony unless you&#x27;ve got jet black hair and dark skin). This product works sooo much better when it&#x27;s dried out, so I suggest leaving it open in front of a fan and just waiting it out for it to get drier. Don&#x27;t use it once or twice and decide you don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s a product that requires some experimentation and adjusting to find out how it works best for you.    That leads me to my second point: There is no one size fits all way to apply this product. If you do what I did at first and watch a bunch of YouTube tutorials on how to use it, you&#x27;ll probably get frustrated if you have brows like mine. If you have naturally thick eyebrows that are pretty well defined but you just want to make them look more put together, filled in, and better defined, DO NOT outline your brows with this stuff before filling them in like all the tutorials tell you to do. It&#x27;ll leave you with boxy, sharpie-looking brows. Since your brows already have shape to them, just feather in the product into your brows, mimicking your actual hairs and filling in sparse areas or areas where your skin underneath shows. Use a lighter hand on the inner parts of the brow and don&#x27;t try to draw in some unnatural shape that doesn&#x27;t follow your natural brow. In my case, my lower arches aren&#x27;t so well defined like the rest of my brows, so that&#x27;s the only part where I draw a clean, sharp edge and blend upward into my brow. For reference, I use a paint brush on my brows since it&#x27;s stiff yet softand pretty razer thin (a size 6 blender brush from Royal &amp; Langnickel I got at Michael&#x27;s--- I&#x27;ve also used the small eyeliner brush that comes with ELF&#x27;s cream eyeliners and that works for me too), in case you don&#x27;t want to drop 18 bucks on Anastasia&#x27;s brush. Again, what works for me won&#x27;t work for every single person, you need to tinker around with this stuff a bit to find how it best works for you. Those YouTube tutorials are useful if you have naturally sparse brows that aren&#x27;t so well-defined to begin with, but for thick eyebrows like mine, they don&#x27;t offer much help.    As for the quality of the product itself: Absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ve used pencils and powders and waxes in all sorts of different methods and combinations and yet none of them give me the lasting result I get with this stuff. It&#x27;s lasted through sweat, bad weather, occasional afternoon naps with lots of tossing and turning that normally ruins the rest of my eye makeup, etc and comes out looking just as good as when I first applied it. It&#x27;ll last you the whole day on its own and is even better with a brow gel on top to set it in place. The product dries in about a minute as you&#x27;re applying, so that&#x27;s how much time you get to correct any mistakes before it sets into its bulletproof state.    Additionally, it&#x27;s very very very important you get the shade that best matches you otherwise it just won&#x27;t look natural. Things to take into considering are your [head] hair color, skin color, and tone of your brow hairs (e.g. if you have cool-toned brows like mine, chocolate is going to look awful and it won&#x27;t blend in with your brow hairs no matter how much you try, or at least not as well as another shade like dark brown). I got mine at Ulta, so consider exchanging yours for another color if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.    Overall, I&#x27;m incredibly happy with this product and think it&#x27;s well worth the price. Don&#x27;t give up if you&#x27;re not satisfied with it, as long as you have the right color, there&#x27;s a way to make it work so it gives you great looking eyebrows.    EDIT: In case there&#x27;s any confusion, my review isn&#x27;t for the color Auburn, like it states above. I believe that&#x27;s the color that was automatically selected when I clicked on the page.   Additionally, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with more brushes and have found that the eyeliner brush from Sonia Kashuk&#x27;s mini eye brush set (11 bucks at Target-- don&#x27;t buy it on Amazon-- and it comes with a little pouch for the brushes [[ASIN:B0014A2BIY Sonia Kashuk Essential Eye Kit with Case -6 Pieces]] ) is stiff enough and very thin, so I&#x27;ve been using that lately and like the results it gives me.</li>
    <li> Nice but latel different color</li>
    <li> Very dark, be careful when applying it. It&#x27;s best to initially dab your brush in and then smudge it on the inside of the cap and apply from that. Go VERY light and build up. Try to keep the ends of your eyebrow the darkest and don&#x27;t &#x27;square&#x27; your eyebrows, blend it with the tip of you brush and gradient the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts throughout the day, so impressed. :)</li>
    <li> Love it, I waited so long it being sold out everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is bar none the best brow make up period. Amazon has the best price and various colors. I went to another store andand returned what they sold me. I came to Amazon and had exactly the right color. It is smudge and water proof. Very fun to have great eyebrows. Buy a good brow brush to get the best results. Start with your arch. Then go from there * MY TRICK. I am sold. I have brows but sparse. I have some red in my hair so the a burn is the most natural. It is not red but a very soft natural brown...match is great. You do not have to use much. The amount is huge. So I hope it stays soft. I am careful to close tight. No DISAPPOINTMENT!</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LIKES IT....THAT&#x27;S THE BEST I CAN GIVE YOU</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finding it VERY difficult/impossible to get this on without it looking super artificial. It looks like mud; i&#x27;ve tried several times to limit the amount i put on a brush - down to a very negligible amount.  I&#x27;m going to try an eyebrow wand and hope that works better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an eyebrow powder since bare minerals discontinued the color I usually use. Have tried the lower end as well as higher end products and have been let down. The consistency of this product helps to look more natural rather than greasy or too fake. Even after sweating it stays on... It&#x27;s waterproof! Great product... Color is as described.</li>
    <li> As any redhead knows, finding GOOD eyebrow powder/wax/pencil in a color that matches is difficult at best.  I had high hopes for this product, as Anastasia is a well respected brand.  I was disappointed to find that the product is more brown than auburn.  The texture is good and applies nicely.  Unfortunately I will have to move on in my quest to find the perfect red eyebrow color.</li>
    <li> Amazing !! LOVE IT ...</li>
    <li> I have  naturall  dark  brown  hair  and  practically  black  brows. I  have  been  dying  my  hair  for  years  in  red/auburn  colour  with  gold  undertone - and  dying  my  brows  too  in  some  kind  of  the  same  colour. I  have  very  long  and  thick  hair  in  my  brows  but  rather  rare - that&#x27;s  way  I  need  to  fill  somehow  thees  gaps  and  also  to  correct  the  form  of  my  brows.&lt;br /&gt;I  wasn&#x27;t  sure - what  colour  should  I  order  and I  chose  Auburn  and  it&#x27;s appeared  too  dark. The  fact  is  that  I  don&#x27;t  want  to  make  my  brows  darker  like  many  other  women (it&#x27;s  not  suit  for  my  face)  but  I  need  only  to  make  them  brighter  and  fill  the  gaps.&lt;br /&gt;I  can  advice  this  product  for  that  women  who  need  to  correct  the  form  of  their  brows.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I was skeptical at first as to whether it would be worth the money since it is expensive, but it lasts forever. The only thing I would say is that the auburn color is a little dark and I wish I&#x27;d gotten the blonde one since I still have to use my trusty old eyebrow pencil anyway</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow product that I&#x27;ve ever used! Especially considering I have extremely fair skin and almost translucent blonde eyebrows. Every other &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; eyebrow pencil or powder I&#x27;ve used has came out on my fair skin almost reddish or to unnaturally dark. I &amp;#60;3 my Anatasia Dip Brow Pomade and I get compliments on my eyebrows all the time now. :) And the whole pot will last me LITERALLY 2 years.</li>
    <li> It was not as auburn as I thought, but I still like the color.</li>
    <li> Yes, I really do love this stuff. It makes my pale and almost non-existent eyebrows look great AND natural.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot ! Really nice product !</li>
    <li> Takes longer to apply than a pencil or powder but lasts all day. I have a fair complexion and (right now) light strawberry blonde hair; eyebrows are a light brown. The Auburn color looks a little darker than I thought it would but, if applied lightly, it works. Ordering the Blonde today to see if it is a better match for me. This is by far the best eyebrow makeup I&#x27;ve ever tried and needs to be used with a tapered, good quality brush.</li>
    <li> I have thin brows and I have always had issues with facial perspiration. I didn&#x27;t bother with pencils any more after dying my hair blonde for many, many ears. Now that I am back to my natural brunette hair color, I needed to match my brows and had little or no luck with pencils. This came highly recommended so I gave it a try, and I am so glad that I did! I am now dealing with hot flashes but this stuff stays in tact until I wipe it off with a washcloth. I highly recommend this product - and as has been posted previously, do purchase a good brow brush, it really does make a difference.</li>
    <li> I already have one of these and I just had to buy one for my mom. She loves it.</li>
