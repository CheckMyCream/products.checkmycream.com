      <li>it used to be real light and sweet and people gravitated to me.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite light scents.</li>
      <li>and how much she loved it.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, good product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a heavier scent, putting too much on can be kind of overwhelming.</li>
      <li>and I am not disappointed at all.  </li>
      <li>It cam in an original box and no problem with the packaging.</li>
      <li>The product is genuine and it came quickly.  </li>
      <li>Just the right gift for Christmas!</li>
      <li>This is one of the best frangrances...very light, subtle but</li>
      <li>Full satisfaction.</li>
      <li>I have bought this perfume from different retailers and online, and the smell just everlasting, you don&#x27;t need to put too much, one spray does it for me, best results, right after a bath or a shower spray the Romance on and Romance lotion, WOW!!!</li>
      <li>Quick service</li>
      <li>so Romance might be my new favorite.</li>
      <li>The person I bought this for is very special, and had asked for this particular scent.  </li>
      <li>I love the soft smell.  </li>
      <li>I am now 29 years old and I still love it.</li>
      <li>RL did a great job choosing a name for this perfume because it fits the scent to a T, it smells like something lovely and nostalgic.</li>
      <li>They shipped it very fast.</li>
      <li>I wil recommend this to any woman who wants to feel fresh.</li>
      <li>bought many years back</li>
      <li>I really miss it!</li>
      <li>and I had to have it in a real bottle!  </li>
      <li>Thanks for a hassle-free purchase!</li>
      <li>Romance definitely has more presence.</li>
      <li>Ordered this with fast shipping and it came really fast!</li>
      <li>Romance by Ralph Lauren for Women is a sweet soft fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It is definitely long-lasting, my clothes continue to carry the scent long after I take them off (which is nice because it&#x27;s such a lovely scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was packaged very well.</li>
      <li>Makes me wonder if it&#x27;s the real Ralph Lauren.</li>
      <li>My wife really enjoys this fragrance...</li>
      <li>I bought the spray, because it goes much farther and spreads out the scent instead of concentrating it in one area.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t always bother with those fragrance giveaways--but this one really grabbed my attention</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like real alcohol smelling...</li>
      <li>The perfume smells as nice, but vanishes within a few hours.  </li>
      <li>Bottle was very pretty but smaller</li>
      <li>Romance by Ralph Lauren has been my favorite perfume since I was a little girl.</li>
      <li>Compared to something like Daisy by Marc Jacobs (which is an airy, light, not very long-lasting Spring scent)</li>
      <li>I usually use this in winter and Ralph in summer :)</li>
      <li>she was surprised, not sure why but ok points for me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like a strong, heavy scent and this is not.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly as I saw mentioned in other reviews.</li>
      <li>I really hope this is the real perfume, because I had some left from a larger bottle...</li>
      <li>The product seems to be OK, but I was surprised to get the travel atomizer and not the small regular bottle.</li>
      <li>no mess ups.</li>
      <li>It has been a few years now and am still looking for the right repalcement!  </li>
      <li>I still like the scent and am happy to have found this perfume, since it&#x27;s near impossible to find in stores anymore.</li>

<li> , I have seen bad reviews from those that saying it doesn&#x27;t smell the same, that all depends on your body reflecting off the perfume, everyones body have a such oil that if you put to much or not to much that it might not maybe smell the same to your noses!!</li>
<li> aged perfume probably does smell different.</li>
<li> Also, the box did not have the sealed plastic wrapping that my other Ralph Lauren purchases always have.</li>
<li> I usually wear Philosophy Inner Grace and just discovered it is discontinued</li>
<li> it is a little pricey</li>
<li> I did think it was a little pricey for the size.</li>
<li> She has worn this since I was little</li>
<li> i get compliments almost everyday.</li>
<li> so i waited a few weeks and then gave it to her for mothers day.</li>
<li> Just a little advice, put just a little on and see!!</li>
<li> it smells weird and gross.  </li>
<li> And, to everyone saying they received bad smelling or old bottles from Amazon</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Spells very good to me. It was packaged very well.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. I usually use this in winter and Ralph in summer :)</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve always loved the scent.  It&#x27;s very hard to give review on perfume. You like it or not.</li>
    <li> Romance by Ralph Lauren for Women is a sweet soft fragrance.  I bought the spray, because it goes much farther and spreads out the scent instead of concentrating it in one area.  I have been very satisfied with it and have received many compliments from friends when I wore my &#x27;Romance&#x27;.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my wife...she loved it.</li>
    <li> Ralph Lauren is all I ever worn since the 1990&#x27;s so I took a chance on trying Romance and I am not disappointed at all.  Fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Ordered this with fast shipping and it came really fast! Quick service no mess ups. Thanks for a hassle-free purchase!</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously amazing and reminds me of my mom. She has worn this since I was little and she continues to wear it to this day :)</li>
    <li> Not quite like the fragrence I remember.</li>
    <li> I love the soft smell.  I wil recommend this to any woman who wants to feel fresh.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for her to wear at our wedding.  She ran out of it earlier this year.  Had to buy it again for her and it is such an awesome scent.</li>
    <li> The perfume smells as nice, but vanishes within a few hours.  Makes me wonder if it&#x27;s the real Ralph Lauren.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this one. Gave as a Christmas Gift to a friend who LOVES IT...Different Strokes for Different Folks............Not for me</li>
    <li> Bottle should be bigger to last longer.</li>
    <li> Smells very good. They shipped it very fast. Full satisfaction.</li>
    <li> This is a good fragrance. I get a lot of compliment when I wear it.  The fragrance lingers and I am told all the time how good I smell.</li>
    <li> The person I bought this for is very special, and had asked for this particular scent.  Seemed very pleased.  I think she will enjoy it greatly.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells on her, and she love&#x27;s it too. I would by it again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> so my wife had this s a gift from here sister and loved it. i did not realize she was out and how much she loved it. one day she drops an obvious hint about if i ever need a gift idea this would be it. this after she asked for this, i found it then she said too expensive and would not let me buy it. women confuse me, even mine. anyway...so i waited a few weeks and then gave it to her for mothers day. she was surprised, not sure why but ok points for me. she loved it and it is her fav and she wears it all the time. it&#x27;s a nice addition to the collection for you or your lady. Romance, Chanel no 5, Caesar&#x27;s Woman all good choices among others.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good product. I was skeptical buying this perfume as I did read reviews. I had a sample of Romance from Macy&#x27;s to compare it too. Smelled the same. Doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly as I saw mentioned in other reviews. I believe it&#x27;s legit.</li>
    <li> RL did a great job choosing a name for this perfume because it fits the scent to a T, it smells like something lovely and nostalgic. I absolutely LOVE this perfume. It is definitely long-lasting, my clothes continue to carry the scent long after I take them off (which is nice because it&#x27;s such a lovely scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a heavier scent, putting too much on can be kind of overwhelming. Compared to something like Daisy by Marc Jacobs (which is an airy, light, not very long-lasting Spring scent) Romance definitely has more presence. I&#x27;ve received compliments on it from both men and women (I&#x27;m in my mid-20&#x27;s and I think that it&#x27;s well suited for this age range).</li>
    <li> Got as a Christmas gift and my daughter won&#x27;t quite using it as she used all of hers. Love it. It smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the regular version of Ralph but I love the way Romance smells! It cam in an original box and no problem with the packaging.</li>
    <li> My wife really enjoys this fragrance...</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, lasts and is quite strong. I always get complimented when I wear this. I love the lotion as well.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for years and I always get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Mine as well as my wifes fav.</li>
    <li> The product seems to be OK, but I was surprised to get the travel atomizer and not the small regular bottle. Also, the box did not have the sealed plastic wrapping that my other Ralph Lauren purchases always have. It made me wonder if it was legitmately Ralph Lauren.</li>
    <li> I smelled Ralph Lauren in a store and i saw the price and i was like ill go to amazon i can get it cheaper there so i bought it here and after purchasing it i read the reviews and was scared because people said this isn&#x27;t it. well, i beg to differ. It smells like it and i am VERY satisfied. i get compliments almost everyday.</li>
    <li> Bottle was very pretty but smaller than I thought.  However, it smells great and somebody who is familiar with the scent said it is the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Just the right gift for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I really hope this is the real perfume, because I had some left from a larger bottle...bought many years back and the smells smell different...But, then again...aged perfume probably does smell different. I still like the scent and am happy to have found this perfume, since it&#x27;s near impossible to find in stores anymore. I did think it was a little pricey for the size.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite light scents.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite cologne all summer. I usually wear Philosophy Inner Grace and just discovered it is discontinued so Romance might be my new favorite. I don&#x27;t like a strong, heavy scent and this is not. It is very light and pleasant.</li>
    <li> My Daughter loved it.  It was a Christmas gift</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always bother with those fragrance giveaways--but this one really grabbed my attention and I had to have it in a real bottle!  Get lots of compliments on this scent--it smells great!</li>
    <li> Favorite perfume.....Love the way it smells light and wonderful</li>
    <li> Abosulutely love it!  My Husband says, &amp;#34;It smells Classy&amp;#34;.  Totally my kinda scent. #Happy!</li>
    <li> The product is genuine and it came quickly.  I needed it for Valentines day and it shipped ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> Romance by Ralph Lauren has been my favorite perfume since I was a little girl. My grandmother used to buy it for me every Christmas. I am now 29 years old and I still love it. My mother absolutely loves it too and for this amazing price, I ordered 3 (2 for myself and one for my mom)!</li>
    <li> I would just like to say this was always my signature scent!! And, to everyone saying they received bad smelling or old bottles from Amazon it&#x27;s not the case.  I RETURNED MANY BOTTLES TO MACY&#x27;S AS WELL!! The sales people are trying to convince me it&#x27;s my age which is 40 been wearing this since like 20 something..that my smell has changed lol. .No matter where I buy Romance it smells weird and gross.  It&#x27;s like real alcohol smelling... it used to be real light and sweet and people gravitated to me.  Something is just wrong and bad and different about it!  It is not the same and it&#x27;s not my sense of smell or body chemistry!  It has been a few years now and am still looking for the right repalcement!  It is very disappointing.  Somehow the formula or flowers has changed.  Not even sure how people even like it now.. it&#x27;s so bad compared to what I was used to!  I really miss it!</li>
    <li> I have bought this perfume from different retailers and online, and the smell just everlasting, you don&#x27;t need to put too much, one spray does it for me, best results, right after a bath or a shower spray the Romance on and Romance lotion, WOW!!! you will get results from anyone around you!! I say I rate this as a 10!!, I have seen bad reviews from those that saying it doesn&#x27;t smell the same, that all depends on your body reflecting off the perfume, everyones body have a such oil that if you put to much or not to much that it might not maybe smell the same to your noses!! Just a little advice, put just a little on and see!!</li>
    <li> gave this as a gift for my girlfriend. smells great to me and she loves it as well. it is a little pricey but I believe you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best frangrances...very light, subtle but you know it is there when someone walks by.  Have been buying for my Mom for many years...she always gets compliments when she wears it.</li>
