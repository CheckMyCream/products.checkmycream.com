<li> Also, it left yellow soap scum stains in my tub and on my shower curtain.</li>
<li> It is rough and scratchy due to the orange peel and will irritate skin.</li>
<li> , so if you are looking for a tea tree soap this one may not fit the bill.  </li>
<li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>

The doctor suggested something with tea tree oil or lemongrass; the soap has both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked wonders but had an added bonus of leaving her skin soft and not too dried out. We bought more so the whole family can enjoy it now.</li>
