      <li>If anyone can help it is so appreciated :-)</li>
      <li>I paid a full price so I should get a full jar.</li>
      <li>Loved the final result.</li>
      <li>Sweet colors and variety.</li>
      <li>sometimes i just put a couple of drops of nail polish and mixed really good.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop using it and the dryer drys it quickly</li>
      <li>The colors are very pretty.</li>
      <li>You can get the best result when you mix this with other soakoff gel products and regular fine glitters.</li>
      <li>Most colors I find need to have white underneath to show true colors since they are quite light.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very disappointed. I have used gelish and shellac and they are both great. This product is too thick to spread and smells awful. I ended up throwing all the colors away. A complete waste of money even if this product was on sale for a $1 I would not purchase it. Save your money and buy something else.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for every nail enthusiast! great product. Tons and tons of colors to choose from, all nice and neat in convenient see through jars. Perfect and small enough for traveling!</li>
    <li> This product is billed as a soak off gel.  I do my own gelish nails at home and never have a problem. THIS IS NOT SOAK OFF!!!!!!  I cannot stress that enough.  I soaked for more than twenty minutes to no avail and finally had to FILE IT OFF.  This is not good as I have very thin nails and don&#x27;t file much anyway.  SAVE your MONEY unless you are a professional nail salon.  The colors are great, but it doesn&#x27;t do me much good if I can&#x27;t get the stuff off.  The only reason that this got one star is because you have to rate it something.  If it hadn&#x27;t been billed as soak off, I would not have bought it and wasted my time.  PLEASE ADVERTISE PROPERLY!!</li>
    <li> Many different colors that all have glitter! You will be shinning every day. This works great with the Shany UV light. The outcome is great and it stays on for weeks without chipping. The only thing that I noticed was it was difficult to remove the glitter, you have to really scrub it off.</li>
    <li> This product and company is absolutely a RIP OFF. More than two repeat colors, and 80% of them were so dried up I could not even get the jars open. AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL!</li>
    <li> I loveeee this alot! If you like a little spark to your nails and into Glitter this is the right thing for you. It gives my nails that push of life that looks absoluetly love!</li>
    <li> These are so cool you will have so much fun doing your nails with these!! 24 fun colors and your creative mind go wild bring some color Into your world!![[ASIN:B006ENQHLS SHANY Cosmetics Gel Polish -DIY UV Color Gel Set Of 24 Colors - Powder Acrylic UV Gel - Glitter Frenzy]]</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this product because you will most likely mess it up and get bad results. The gel is thick but that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to be, you need the right brushes to spread it that&#x27;s all. It&#x27;s not billed as soak off it&#x27;s the same stuff used in a pro salon so if you put it on you either fill in or completely take it off. My nails turned out great and I did them myself. They look better than getting them done at the salon. My only problem is that they are all glittery and I would have liked some more solid colors, which I only recieved four of. Other than that great product, when I run out I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I am a total glitter nut and I love it on my nails.  I also love to be able to do my nails at home when I have time in my busy schedule! Shany also offers a UV light to cure nails at a low price.</li>
    <li> I like that they come in these cute jars with gold tops and with a wide color range. If your in to nails or starting to be then you should know glitters are a must have. I like the shades of green the most here.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking that it was a great deal on some gel polish. I found that my problem with this gel is the exact opposite of what everyone else was saying. I couldn&#x27;t get the gel to stay on my nails. As soon as i finished curing the gel it would start chipping and peeling off. Not to mention like others said it is a super thick consistency and smells horrible. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> I read the review before I bought this thinking that everyone&#x27;s own personal experience is different. Yes the polish is very thick, like the consistency of toothpaste but you can still make it work if your willing to take that extra step. After you spread it on your nail and cure it, it will be an uneven layer since it is so thick. All you need to do is to file the top to make it even then put the sealer on and it turns out the same. But beware that if you aren&#x27;t a pro at nail polish application or have the time then this product probably isn&#x27;t for you. Also beware there is no return available on this product. I noticed that I got a few of the same colors &amp; there are some shown in the picture which are not in the packaged set.</li>
    <li> I just started learning how to do Gel nails and when I was looking at products I stumbled on this so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try! There are so many colors to choose from and the price is quite reasonable considering other kits come with 2 colors and are more money than this was! Can&#x27;t wait to do nails for my friends!</li>
    <li> First of all, let me clarify how difficult glitter is to remove from nails. Even as a polish, you gotta kinda scrub it away. With that said, I knew what to expect going into this purchase. So I must say, this set is great! So much color and variety, I can change my nails as often as I want, the glitter doesn&#x27;t flake off or become dull after a few days. The range of colors coupled with the price couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
    <li> Great advertising, bold stand out color images ,Packaged great ,I&#x27;ve purchased Product of SHANY Cosmetics .I&#x27;ll just put 3 stars for now until I can fully use item .with other gel products.</li>
    <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;I just loved these gel polish !&lt;br /&gt;you had to do it yourself which makes it more fun&lt;br /&gt;And they are UV gel&lt;br /&gt;glittery too! plenty of colors to chose from that I am sure will match your outfit!</li>
    <li> Is way too thick, so thick that it is almost impossible to spread. Maybe it&#x27;s a bad batch, but my wife won&#x27;t purchase it again. Amazon won&#x27;t accept returns on nail gel or polish due to it being &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34;, they seem to ship it just fine though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if my product is defective or it is supposed to be gooey.  It is very thick and difficult to apply.  All the colors are the same, the seal is not broken.  With a top coat, you can&#x27;t see the brush strokes and it looks ok, but the product was disappointing for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice and colorful gel, but a little too sticky. Also, most of the gels came less than half way full. Not a good thing. I paid a full price so I should get a full jar. Colors where repeted more than twice. I like how it dries and looks but if you do not have clear nails or color gel to place first under, then it would not show well. But if what you want is clear glitter with a touch of color then this is the gel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many high reviews of this...my tiny jars are not even half full!! also the colors are not bright at all.  after 4 coats and you still can&#x27;t tell what color it is? Way too sheer.  Would not recommend. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Great selection of gels. They are more of a polish than a builder gel, but I&#x27;ve had a lot y fun with these!!</li>
    <li> Some leaked but over all they are nice.  Thank you for a great product that will last well. I will enjoy them,</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I opened the box. Only to find a scratched up dirty looking container. So, I opened the plastic box thing and start looking at the pretty colors when I noticed something pink &amp; sticky on my fingers. I opened the pink one &amp; it didn&#x27;t have a seal &amp; leaked out of the container. I opened another one &amp; noticed it was sealed. So, it looks like seller shipped a used set to me.... Bummer. Just got off the phone with amazon &amp; they can&#x27;t just ship another one since amazon isn&#x27;t the one selling it. So I had to buy another one. Which was bumped up to free 1 day shipping. Ty amazon. No Ty seller. Now waiting on my other one. That hopefully isn&#x27;t used. Then returning the used one so I don&#x27;t have to buy a box to ship it back in since the box it came in is huge because it was shipped with other stuff. The colors are very pretty. That&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m giving this another go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: On the leave seller feedback I put \\&quot;Item came opened. Returning for a refund. I didn&#x27;t pay for a used item\\&quot; &amp; amazon removed my entry. I always wondered how these sellers had such high ratings. Now I know... Amazon removes the low star ratings. I&#x27;m sure this will get removed also. I guess your not suppose to talk about the item... Humm... Why not??!!! The good reviews can but the bad experience can&#x27;t. I most differently will not be renewing my prime membership. Not worth the dishonestly that amazon is portraying. Buyers should be able to make a purchase based on the entire truth. Not just want amazon wants them to see. Giving item three stars since I haven&#x27;t used it yet. I&#x27;ll make a real rating after I&#x27;ve used the product. No high hopes here!</li>
    <li> These Gel nail polishes are a big hit with my clients, they go on so smoothly and don&#x27;t clump.  I just wish there was more of each color.  The bottles are small and can only do 1-2 sets of nails.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore the packaging on these. A pretty way to containe such pretty nail products. I can&#x27;t wait to try these out.</li>
    <li> This item has great colors but it doesnt soak off and its to thick for a gel product. It is a great item it just starting out with a gel product.</li>
    <li> these colors are so beautiful and so shimmery!! i love that i can now do my own nails this good!!</li>
    <li> This set of gels and glitters save me so much money. I don&#x27;t have to go to salons anymore and I do just as well on my own at home.</li>
    <li> When I received my gel polish I couldn&#x27;t open the little bottles. The two that I was able to open were really gooey and when tried to put them on my nails it look horrible. Please save your time and money and buy something different. I just asked for my refund</li>
    <li> seriously i&#x27;m able to save so much money with this set! i can have gorgeous nails that lasts for weeks at home now. the colors are so beautiful</li>
    <li> These are so much fun!!!  I love the colors, the options, the variety!  You can mix and match, so much fun!</li>
    <li> Nice variety of Gel Polish perfect for a sleepover as a teen or a ladies pampering day. You could also purchase this product for your own salon and save some money. Sweet colors and variety. Love it!</li>
    <li> Loved the colors. Totally worth it. It is a bit thick... just need partience i guess and add a little at a time. Im not a pro or anything but i didnt have any trouble with it at all. Loved the final result. Beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> I got this as a present from my husband. I love it but here lies the dilema I can&#x27;t figure out the cure time for it .I tried for 10 minutes but it is sticky . The colors without the glitter have a cure time of 4 min. If anyone can help it is so appreciated :-)</li>
    <li> I was a beginner at this before so I had to practice for a little while but as soon I got the hang of it I couldn&#x27;t stop using it and the dryer drys it quickly</li>
    <li> If you know how to do gel nails, you need this set! Great colors and lasts for days! And sooooo much glitter!</li>
    <li> I hope this help, yes the gells are very sick, and very hard to work with, but if you take the time you could actually get you nails done. sometimes i just put a couple of drops of nail polish and mixed really good. the time that it take for them to dry is 2 to 3 minutes of course one hand at a time or a few finger at a time, them when you are actually done applying the gell and them  the glossy gell, you set the time up for 3 minutes, if you preffer to do anothe 2 minutes is ok to do, when you are done doing all the nails, you take a cotton ball or very small piece of paper towell and soaking it in alcohol. them you wipe off all the nails with the alcohol and this will take the stickiness away and them you are done.  Take another piece of paper towell and make them shine or a cotton ball.</li>
    <li> I am a cashier, and my nail polish would never make it through one night. This stuff is awesome and I love the variety of colors, I have only tried one though, because it lasts so long!</li>
    <li> Great product and price. Shimmer is beautiful and easy to do. Saves money on going to salons. :-) :-) :-)</li>
    <li> OK, First off, I had my sister who owns a salon show me how to use a gel before I ordered the kit.  She also helped me order the brushes.  Understand, if you want to remove these you have to soak your nails in PURE ACETONE. Not nail polish remover containing acetone, or acetone artificial nail remover.  PURE ACETONE, these nails are exactly like the salons use so you either replace or fill them.  Now that said.  I love these nails.  I&#x27;ll be honest, I did it to save money.  The salons are charging a fortune for nails anymore.  Even if I went to my Sister&#x27;s salon it would still cost a lot.  The economy is driving everyone to save.  The only suggestion I have is include more solid colors. I will definately keep buying more of the gel polish. Linda W.</li>
    <li> Most colors I find need to have white underneath to show true colors since they are quite light. Gel Is thick and easy to work with. Not a very shiny finish ( I am picky) so needs to be scuffed and topped with a finishing gel for exceptional shine. Cures quickly and price was good. My customers love the colors. It was a good buy.</li>
    <li> I love this product because I can have a lot of fun with it with my friends and my family members and even my little sister I love it</li>
    <li> I love these they are so great! I love all of the shades especially the bright pink one, i use them alot for body painting to add sparkle and detail.</li>
    <li> This product is ok if you are placing the gel over a solid nail polish color or a clear color. The sparkles kind of make the polish look like it is made for a young girl to wear.</li>
    <li> these colors couldn&#x27;t be found sparklier anywhere else. these little guys are small but take so little to make a big impact, the colors are great the shine is perfect and the price is amazing!</li>
    <li> I am a nail technician. This is not a soakoff gel. It does not say how long you need to cure under UV. In my experience, 2 minutes is fine. I tested out with LED light and noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work with LED. This gel polish set is a good deal and has beautiful glitters inside. I do not use this gel alone becuase it&#x27;s basically just glitters mixed with transparent hard gel liquid. You can get the best result when you mix this with other soakoff gel products and regular fine glitters. It&#x27;s a fun product to keep.</li>
    <li> I bought this for  my daughter for Easter and she loved it. The colors are all so beautiful it makes you want to try them all. It arrived very quickly and I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I bought this colors for myself.I did my  gel manicure with shany gel polish and it looks like one done in the salon.I used brush from my girls painting set to apply the gel.(yesterday i purchase brush for gel,but i didn&#x27;t use it yet)Gel is thick but that isn&#x27;t a problem at all.It is a benefit because liquid  ones my drip over the cuticle edges,when thumbs are in the UV lamp. Just needs to be apply slowly to cover all nail.I put two coats on my nails.Love it and will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! VERY NICE COLORS AND THEY ARE TRUE TO COLOR!! IF YOUR NOT A PRO IT MAY A LITTLE DIFFICULT AT FIRST!! BUT PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE!! ITS DEFINITELY WORTH THE BUY!!</li>
    <li> great colors and i received the gel set instead of this powdered set i ordered.  dealt with it and used it all the same.  would help if the polishes were a little more runny.  it&#x27;s builder gel quality and works great in combo with clear/pink builder gel though for an ombre or gradation type mani.</li>
    <li> These gels are pretty and very sparkly. They can do the job but I don&#x27;t find them to be the most practical when you need to use a brush and there are now polishes that come in nail polish form with a brush included and they go on much smoother, I use gelish. I had bought these when I was first trying out gel at home. And they also ended up leaking all over the place.</li>
    <li> I love these gel polishes they are colorful and cure nicely.  After reading other reviews I was unsure being that a few people said they got 2 and 3 of the same color.  Actually they are not the same they have different size and color glitters in them.  I wish the bottles was bigger but I would purchase these again and I do recommend.</li>
    <li> I love these things! so many colors to choose from! and so nicee and so many for a good price! I don&#x27;t think you can get a better value then at shany! its a must have for a nail artist</li>
    <li> Wow! These gel polish are very unique! Perfect to match you outfit for a girls night out! Plus it is UV! What can do wrong Very easy to go on and use!</li>
    <li> Not quality, chips of your nails quickly, some of the pots arrived leaking thick goopy nasty-ness all over the rest of them. They arrived loose in a box with no padding or tissue or anthing to keep them from banging around during shipping. Pretty colors and love the super itensity of the glitters, but I would never order from this company again.</li>
    <li> So many pretty colors and I think it a great price seeing that you get 21 gel polishes! Also get the Shany UV light!</li>
    <li> so many beautiful colors to choose from!! everyone always thinks i get my nails done at a professional salon, they just look so perfect and beautiful!</li>
