      <li>Wonderful smell</li>
      <li>Amazing!!!!!</li>
      <li>I would recommend something like the smashbox photo finish primer for concealing pores (but it doesn&#x27;t have the best oil control).</li>

      <li>Very good smell, and it leaves my face feeling like baby skin.</li>
      <li>it is great.</li>
      <li>The neutrogena shine control does a great job of minimizing my shine but it lacks in controlling the pore.</li>

<li> I do see a slight difference</li>
<li> so I had to order a few at a time.</li>
<li> Little to no tint in color!</li>
<li> Keep in mind that the tube is kinda small.</li>

<li> dont buy this product..pathetic and useless..</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell and it works well.</li>
<li> Really disappointed</li>

    <li> Wonderful smell I do see a slight difference</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it really does go great with my makeup, and makes the makeup stay on longer. It doesnt feel like it clogs my pored or anything, and it really does make it look like I don&#x27;t have pores under my makeup, without making it look too fake.</li>
    <li> use it everyday, it is great :)</li>
    <li> Goes on well but does nothing to hide pores. Really disappointed</li>
    <li> Really nice, moisturizes the skin and does make your pores look better. And the smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> The primer is alright. I&#x27;ve tried cheaper products that work a lot better. A positive would be that it was easy to apply and felt lotion which made it feel natural on my face. Keep in mind that the tube is kinda small.</li>
    <li> Makeup goes on super smooth over this. It&#x27;s a great base</li>
    <li> Even after application, I put on my foundation and all I can see are the empty spaces where my huge pores are. Although its name is &amp;#34;goodbye pore ever&amp;#34;, it honestly didn&#x27;t help my pores at all. It is a good primer for keeping makeup set all day, but I need to put three layers on my larger pores before putting my makeup over it.</li>
    <li> While this isn&#x27;t going to improve your pore appearance by using it, it does MASK minor pores.  I also noticed less slipping of my BB cream and my face is much less oily by the end of the day.  I dont think its comparable to Benefits similar product - I could wear that alone, but it&#x27;s a great value for the price!</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t minimize the pore,infact doesn&#x27;t do anything except greasing the skin..looks and feels like cheap quality creme..not even any tint or color is there...dont buy this product..pathetic and useless..</li>
    <li> This stuff is really nice. It is smooth and not oily. It also has a good smell, unlike many other primers I have used. I saw some other reviews that were negative, but I think they must be crazy because this stuff works well for me. This doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, it actually has helped in reducing my acne a bit. Overall I will buy again, and might get some for gifts this Holiday season.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect!! I love it..smells nice</li>
    <li> Great product that&#x27;s not too heavy or too light. I use it daily before I apply my moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell and it works well. A little goes a long way. I only use a pea size amount under each eye and down nose. Product last a VERY long time.</li>
    <li> Very good smell, and it leaves my face feeling like baby skin. Helps makeup stay longer and does actually cover my pores. I do not have a lot of pores but i do have scars and imperfections left by acne and this product can actually do it&#x27;s thing and help get even coverage and applying makeup without drying your skin.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This is the only pore minimizer I have tried aside from Estee Lauder...I can only say that it is good. I am sure at its price point it is great. but I don&#x27;t feel like it minimized my pores...but it is a GREAT base for foundation and everything else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think its helped with my pores really that I can tell. Nor does it minimize anything prior to makeup application but given the dry skin from winter I may have other factors at play. Will try again in the spring.</li>
    <li> Best. Product. Ever. I have huge pores and my makeup doesn&#x27;t usually last me all day, but this helps with both of those problems! I use this as a primer and it&#x27;s amazing! It keeps my pores looking non-existent and it feels soft and light over the skin! Little to no tint in color! You only need two or three squeezes to cover the entire face! The only problem is that the size of this is really small so I had to order a few at a time.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t fill the pores AS MUCH as i&#x27;d like, but does the job i suppose.</li>
    <li> I did not see this primer doing much for my skin. It is a white consistency that applies on smoothly and dissolves into the skin but as for concealing my pores, it is does a very subtle job of it. Also, it does not seem to make my makeup last longer either or maintain my oil as I am my skin is oily/dry combo. I would recommend something like the smashbox photo finish primer for concealing pores (but it doesn&#x27;t have the best oil control). The neutrogena shine control does a great job of minimizing my shine but it lacks in controlling the pore.</li>
    <li> Since I received this product, my friends get jealous at the fact that my make it still the same even after a night of partying. I told them it was a Korean product I discovered but they are reluctant to try. I might get them a couple to try so they can get used to it. I am so loving this product.</li>
    <li> this product has my absolut love. I do have a oily T section of my face that i struggled for years. Now it is under control by using this product. Sometimes i even go without makeup at all just this product alone. Of course right now is winter. Wait for Spring update and summer as well.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!! That is all!</li>
