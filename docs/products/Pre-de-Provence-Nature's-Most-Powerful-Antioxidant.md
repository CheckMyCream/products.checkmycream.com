### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>recommended by my aunt and so awesome.  </li>
      <li>Awesome stuff.</li>
      <li>I read an article that said this would not make me break out, but was an excellent way to cleanse my skin.  </li>
      <li>Great Product!  </li>
      <li>LOVE!!!</li>
      <li>Great makeup remover even for &#x27;</li>
      <li>Use it in the shower, great for shaving legs.  </li>
      <li>but if you just want a great cleaner - this one is great.</li>
      <li>As it turns out, it&#x27;s a very nice cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy to be able to find it on Amazon!</li>
      <li>good product..will buy again soon~</li>
      <li>Good Stuff.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a good value for the price.</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Argon oil is amazing.</li>
      <li>and I was not used to cleansing oils of any kind that would foam.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s 97% effective but not perfect.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It would be nice if this came with a pump or foam pump dispenser instead.</li>
      <li>Especially great for my sensitive skin!!!  </li>
      <li>When you wash your face you want it to be clean, and most cleansing oils leave me with a feeling that I still need a good lather.  </li>
      <li>I was staying at this beautiful rental home, but the water pressure in the shower was incredibly hardening and harsh on my skin.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I read about oil cleansing and how oil dissolves oil better than water.</li>
      <li>and I might have to say does a better job than most others I&#x27;ve used at keeping the acne away.</li>
      <li>I use mostly on face and sparingly on dryer parts of body too.</li>
      <li>It contains more soap than oil.</li>
      <li>So glad I did.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep because of the discomfort after showering.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First, I love the citrus fragrance of Pre de Provence&#x27;s cleansing oil.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this face wash.</li>
      <li>Love the light, refreshing smell.</li>
      <li>Thinking of using it to clean furniture!</li>
      <li>It rinses off easily and does not leave a greasy film like some cleansing oils do.</li>
      <li>You do need to lather and rinse thoroughly as it doesn&#x27;t rinse easily.  </li>
      <li>It smells wonderful, but more than that, it gently cleans the face and moisturizes at the same time.  </li>
      <li>We in America do not have a cheap cleansing oil.</li>
      <li>It does contain soap though, so probably not for you if you are looking for a soap free cleanser.</li>
      <li>It smells good and last more than 4-5months.</li>
      <li>It just feels clean and it has the feel of nothing on it.</li>
      <li>It thoroughly cleanses my skin and removes all make- up effortlessly and quickly, leaving your skin smooth and clean with no greasy feel</li>
      <li>This product leaves your face squeaky clean without stripping moisture.  </li>
      <li>It rinses clean and my skin loves</li>
      <li>This one is very smooth but it hurts my eyes so much when I rub by eyes to remove eye makeup.</li>
      <li>I received it as a gift originally and have been loyal since.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is also very watery, meaning more than you need always comes out.</li>
      <li>While it leaves my skin smooth and moist, when I follow up with my neroli hydrosol on a cotton pad, the pads come away clean with the first swipe.  </li>
      <li>This cleanser is light, moisturising and smells pleasant enough ... and a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I would wash one more time to completely remove the makeup on my face and then go in with coconut oil or an eye makeup remover to remove mascara and liner.</li>
      <li>But it seems to be gentle and leaves you soft and smelling nice.</li>
      <li>It did a good job of removing my makeup, but it&#x27;s extremely drying on the skin</li>
      <li>Received it very promptly and the only difference is that you apply this to wet face, foams nicely, is a welcome step for me in pre cleansing!  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to go back.</li>
      <li>It has a citrusy smell at first that eventually fades (not a problem with me).</li>
      <li>It takes a very small amount to get great results.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and washes away all of my other makeup, but it can&#x27;t hold a candle to L&#x27;Occitane.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel clean, soft and nourished</li>
      <li>sensitive skin&#x27;---I have &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27;, which means everything makes me break out :)  </li>
      <li>On the positive side, it did remove all my makeup.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why they call this Pre De Provence as &amp;#34;nature&#x27;s most powerful cleansing oil&amp;#34; because first, it is not oil-based and definitely not a powerful cleansing agent unless you&#x27;re cleaning your kitchen sink.</li>
      <li>Scent is very light, just a barely perceptible hint of natural orange oil and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
      <li>review with 4.5 stars is for the whole product line, not for this &amp;#34;cleansing oil&amp;#34; alone.</li>
      <li>and I hoped to use this as a gentle makeup remover for the face and eyes.</li>
      <li>I really like the way this cleanses and hydrates.</li>
      <li>Face feels clean but not dry after use.</li>
      <li>I believed they were supposed to be gentle cleansers</li>
      <li>It cleanses gently and thoroughly.</li>
      <li>This is so gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very liquidy, so</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely nourishing</li>
      <li>I really like this oil.  </li>
      <li>I had positive experiences with the Josie Maran cleanser, but couldn&#x27;t afford the high price and was hoping this would be a decent alternative.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel that this is particularly moisturizing</li>
      <li>I think the soap content in this cleanser is far too high, as it foams way more than any other cleaning oil I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Loreal makes one for British consumers, but doesn&#x27;t see fit to offer it to American consumers!</li>
      <li>I use this on a cotton ball first, to remove makeup, then was with my regular face wash.  </li>
      <li>and it helps protect my sensitive skin without any nicks or cuts!</li>
      <li>This cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
      <li>I understand that those coming from an oil cleanings background (those who use only straight oil like castor or almond oil ) might not find this the same-</li>
      <li>/&gt;But for 25% less money, its overall effectiveness, the aromatherapy, Pre de Provence wins by</li>
      <li>I have combination skin but live in a dry climate.  </li>
      <li>I was a little nervous when I first saw that this was going to foam up.  </li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only hesitation giving it a full 5-star rating is is can be mildly irritating on the skin around your eyes and it doesn&#x27;t completely remove mascara-</li>
      <li>This does as good of a job and less expensive.</li>
      <li>good value- much less expensive than the oil cleanser</li>

<li> It gets rid of all the make stuff without making your skin dry.</li>
<li> Seems to be helping with my dry skin patches.</li>

<li> When I was too lazy to use my normal face wash and lotion after this, my skin would feel tight and dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think you can really go wrong with this product. I generally prefer oil cleansers due to my sensitive, dry (but oily on t-zone) combination skin. This cleanser is light, moisturising and smells pleasant enough ... and a reasonable price. I use mostly on face and sparingly on dryer parts of body too.</li>
    <li> Received it very promptly and the only difference is that you apply this to wet face, foams nicely, is a welcome step for me in pre cleansing!  It&#x27;s nice to have an option that isn&#x27;t expensive!  We in America do not have a cheap cleansing oil. or cleansing water at the drugstore level!  Loreal makes one for British consumers, but doesn&#x27;t see fit to offer it to American consumers!</li>
    <li> I was hoping for an oil-based cleanser that would not strip my face of all oil (but instead cleanse and replenish). I had positive experiences with the Josie Maran cleanser, but couldn&#x27;t afford the high price and was hoping this would be a decent alternative. Alas, after a week of use, my face is now covered in both dry, scaly patches and acne at the same time. This cleanser is also very watery, meaning more than you need always comes out. It would be nice if this came with a pump or foam pump dispenser instead. My husband is now using it as a shower gel, so it&#x27;s not a total loss, but I would caution anyone with dry, sensitive skin to seek out a less stripping cleanser. On the positive side, it did remove all my makeup.</li>
    <li> Love the light, refreshing smell. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, I hardly have to put on lotion when I get into the shower. A little goes a long way but it&#x27;s very liquidy, so watch how you pour it in order to make it last longer. If you get body acne try this out. I bought this because I read about oil cleansing and how oil dissolves oil better than water. Makes sense if you think about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this face wash. I received it as a gift originally and have been loyal since. I previously used Origins Checks and Balances and Mario Badescu. Haven&#x27;t been able to go back. I&#x27;m typically acne prone - this does the job keeping that at bay. I was so nervous to try a face wash that had OIL in the name. So glad I did. Makes your skin feel clean, soft and nourished and I might have to say does a better job than most others I&#x27;ve used at keeping the acne away. Try it! Argon oil is amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not seeing the miraculous results others have, but it has beat the winter dryness.  You do need to lather and rinse thoroughly as it doesn&#x27;t rinse easily.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Pre De Provence Argan Nourishing Cleansing Oil when I was in Ojai, California. I was staying at this beautiful rental home, but the water pressure in the shower was incredibly hardening and harsh on my skin. I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep because of the discomfort after showering. When I went into town the next day I discovered this product at a small decoration and furniture store. I bought it hoping it would help nourish and protect my skin from the hard water and it exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s absolutely nourishing and it doesn&#x27;t leave any unnecessary residue on the skin. Besides using it as a shower oil instead of using shower gel, I also use it for shaving. I apply it to my legs and then put on a layer of shaving lotion and it helps protect my sensitive skin without any nicks or cuts! I am so happy to be able to find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using several brands of cleansing oils. This one is very smooth but it hurts my eyes so much when I rub by eyes to remove eye makeup.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your face squeaky clean without stripping moisture.  Leaves you with angel skin!  I will use this for as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> recommended by my aunt and so awesome.  Especially great for my sensitive skin!!!  LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> I used to use other brands and paid a lot. This does as good of a job and less expensive. I would definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> When you wash your face you want it to be clean, and most cleansing oils leave me with a feeling that I still need a good lather.  Not this one.  While it leaves my skin smooth and moist, when I follow up with my neroli hydrosol on a cotton pad, the pads come away clean with the first swipe.  Scent is very light, just a barely perceptible hint of natural orange oil and that&#x27;s it.  A few drops is all it takes, and a bottle lasts me 4 to 5 months of washing my face an average of three times a day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of cleansing oil for a decade. It thoroughly cleanses my skin and removes all make- up effortlessly and quickly, leaving your skin smooth and clean with no greasy feel whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several brands (DHC, Shu Umeura, Philosophy) and now Pre de Provence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love the citrus fragrance of Pre de Provence&#x27;s cleansing oil. It rinses clean and my skin loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only hesitation giving it a full 5-star rating is is can be mildly irritating on the skin around your eyes and it doesn&#x27;t completely remove mascara- it&#x27;s 97% effective but not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For its effectiveness removing stubborn mascara, I do like Philosophy&#x27;s cleansing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for 25% less money, its overall effectiveness, the aromatherapy, Pre de Provence wins by a smidge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
    <li> It gets rid of all the make stuff without making your skin dry. It is oil but it doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily, either. It smells good and last more than 4-5months.</li>
    <li> Great makeup remover even for &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27;---I have &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27;, which means everything makes me break out :)  I read an article that said this would not make me break out, but was an excellent way to cleanse my skin.  It is, but I use it as &#x27;precleanser&#x27;.  I use this on a cotton ball first, to remove makeup, then was with my regular face wash.  I&#x27;ve been using it for six months, and it hasn&#x27;t made me break out. It&#x27;s a keeper. Love it!  Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> My skin hated this stuff.  It is oddly drying and breakout inducing at the same time.  Too harsh for my sensitive, acne prone skin.  I use it occasionally to remove eye make-up now, but that&#x27;s it.  Thinking of using it to clean furniture!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel that this is particularly moisturizing and I definitely don&#x27;t like when it gets into my eyes but it&#x27;s a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> This cleansing oil was somewhat of a paradox. I had never tried a cleansing oil before, but I was under the impression that they were milky when rubbed into the skin and not soapy. I believed they were supposed to be gentle cleansers and I hoped to use this as a gentle makeup remover for the face and eyes. When you use this it becomes very soapy because of the sulfate it contains (which I failed to realize it had before purchasing.) The sulfate stings the eyes, making it too irritating to completely remove eye makeup. I would use this to remove my face makeup and my eye shadow. I closed my eyes tight while rubbing the lather over my eyes to prevent irritation. I would wash one more time to completely remove the makeup on my face and then go in with coconut oil or an eye makeup remover to remove mascara and liner. It did a good job of removing my makeup, but it&#x27;s extremely drying on the skin so if you are looking for a cleansing oil because you hope to moisturize your skin while cleansing this is not for you! It contains more soap than oil. When I was too lazy to use my normal face wash and lotion after this, my skin would feel tight and dry. I have oily skin so I could only imagine how it would affect dry skin. If you are only looking to use this as a face makeup remover and don&#x27;t have dry skin, this would work for you. If you want a cleansing oil that will remove all of your makeup and moisturize at the same time, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smells wonderful, but more than that, it gently cleans the face and moisturizes at the same time.  I will continue to use this product and reorder time and time again.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this cleanses and hydrates. It rinses off easily and does not leave a greasy film like some cleansing oils do.</li>
    <li> good product..will buy again soon~</li>
    <li> Good Stuff. I understand that those coming from an oil cleanings background (those who use only straight oil like castor or almond oil ) might not find this the same- but if you just want a great cleaner - this one is great. Face feels clean but not dry after use.</li>
    <li> This is a liquid soap, not a &amp;#34;nourishing cleansing oil&amp;#34; as advertised. I thought this was a real cleansing oil, like DHC&#x27;s or Eclos; I&#x27;ve used both of these; I stopped DHC because they test on animals, and Eclos is unfortunately not available on Amazon (are you listening, Amazon??). I don&#x27;t know why they call this Pre De Provence as &amp;#34;nature&#x27;s most powerful cleansing oil&amp;#34; because first, it is not oil-based and definitely not a powerful cleansing agent unless you&#x27;re cleaning your kitchen sink. It is a liquid soap that stings your eyes. It has a citrusy smell at first that eventually fades (not a problem with me). And the customer reviews, since I read them which also partly influence my decision to buy, was for ALL the Pre De Provence products (cleansing oil, body scrub, soap, etc.) I didn&#x27;t read extensively, my fault. The 114+ review with 4.5 stars is for the whole product line, not for this &amp;#34;cleansing oil&amp;#34; alone.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. It takes very little so this bottle will last longer than a much larger bottle of typical body wash. You just drizzle it on and lather. It does contain soap though, so probably not for you if you are looking for a soap free cleanser. But it seems to be gentle and leaves you soft and smelling nice.</li>
    <li> This is so gentle on my skin. It cleanses gently and thoroughly. It takes a very small amount to get great results.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous when I first saw that this was going to foam up.  Usually foaming means drying and I was not used to cleansing oils of any kind that would foam.  As it turns out, it&#x27;s a very nice cleanser.  It&#x27;s not drying or overly oily.  My face does&#x27;t feel stripped or even moisturized.  It just feels clean and it has the feel of nothing on it. I like that because I know that a film of oil isn&#x27;t going to prevent my specialized moisturizers or retinol treatments from working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like some sort of citrus.  It&#x27;s not a scent-less product by any means, but I don&#x27;t think the smell is overpowering.  I&#x27;ve never felt like the smell has stuck around at all.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Will buy again..............</li>
    <li> I bought this in a specialty store in Las Vegas, not from Amazon. I was looking for a replacement for L&#x27;Occitane Apple Almond Cleansing Oil, which I have been faithfully using for years but was discontinued. This cleansing oil is not a suitable replacement for that. I tried using it to remove my waterproof mascara, which resulted in burning eyes. I think the soap content in this cleanser is far too high, as it foams way more than any other cleaning oil I&#x27;ve tried. It smells nice and washes away all of my other makeup, but it can&#x27;t hold a candle to L&#x27;Occitane. The search continues...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I have combination skin but live in a dry climate.  This cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and leaves my skin soft.  My husband has started using it for shaving and his cheeks are noticably softer!</li>
    <li> good value- much less expensive than the oil cleanser I had been using, I will try other products in this line</li>
    <li> I really like this oil.  Use it in the shower, great for shaving legs.  Seems to be helping with my dry skin patches.</li>
