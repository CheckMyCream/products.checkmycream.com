      <li>They loved it too!</li>
      <li>the gloss is great quality.</li>
      <li>Lip Venom by DuWop is very effective and you can feel it working within seconds.</li>
      <li>This stuff works, and is amazing!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good gloss, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
      <li>Loved the stuff.</li>
      <li>Great product that comes very nicely packaged and more than meets your expectations.  </li>
      <li>Leaves a nice gloss like finish when using, but looks great under or over my own lipstick.</li>
      <li>the smell is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok if you want alot of shine with a tingle.    </li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell and</li>
      <li>, I get better results from Carmex.</li>
      <li>Okay - &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love spicey-like smells</li>
      <li>I would and will buy this product again as I love the tingling feeling that it gives.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>I expected a bit more plump but am very happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a great product for general use.</li>
      <li>I was excited to get something that claimed it would plump your lips and make them full.  </li>
      <li>Really gives me that pouty sexy looking lips that I&#x27;ve been wanting.</li>
      <li>What DuWop DOES have is a good tingle and a flavor reminiscent of pepper...</li>
      <li>, I came to Amazon and read all the \\&quot;adequate to awesome\\&quot; reviews about DuWop Lip Venom.</li>
      <li>but then the search continued for an adequate lip plumper.</li>
      <li>The ingredients stimulate circulation in the lips and increase volume slightly while bringing out the natural redness.&lt;br /&gt;For maximum effectiveness, it is best to treat lips at night with a moisturizer...</li>
      <li>This product has a nice sheen for the 5 minutes it last.</li>
      <li>This stuff is not as good as I expected.</li>
      <li>In fact, the first time I used it my lips just burned for a while.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t need much!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true it tingles your lips, but as far as plumping I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using it and after it wears off after a while your lips do feel nice and soft for a long time.</li>
      <li>The gloss is very shiny and goes on well with the brush applicator that is provided.  </li>
      <li>This product didnt really &#x27;plump&#x27; my lips in any way.</li>
      <li>I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t really plump your lips up that much.  </li>
      <li>The tingle is not as intense as people claim</li>
      <li>got hooked on lip explosion because it worked for me - big red shiny lips...with a nice tingle and taste.</li>
      <li>The most you will experience is a stinging and a slightly increased color to your lips.</li>
      <li>I do have to say though, that did stop after about two tries and in general this is just a fantastic gloss.</li>
      <li>Overall worth the burn and tiny size.  </li>
      <li>and thats not a typical smell in lip stuff</li>
      <li>The stining feels quite nice, but it was pretty much a waste of money for such a small bottle.</li>
      <li>The tingling feeling that occurs is not at all what I expected, I found it to be quite pleasant and not at all irritating.  </li>
      <li>It came it a pretty black silk bag and another paper tube, but when I got all the packaging open it was tiny....</li>
      <li>whole lot less.</li>
      <li>oh, and Sephora will send this little vial to you in a really cute pink cardboard tube and drawstring black satin bag.</li>

<li> oh, and Sephora will send this little vial to you in a really cute pink cardboard tube and drawstring black satin bag.</li>
<li> I have used other lip plumpers in the past &amp; havent been able to let my little girl use them because they work so well</li>
<li> It was expensive, and even if I wanted to use it as a lip gloss -- which is NOT why I bought it, it is so outrageously tiny, and in my view, and incredible hoax on us silly consumers.</li>
<li> This tube should last me awhile as I do not use it every single day.  </li>
<li> I found the tube to be small and the price a bit high but a little of the gloss goes a long long way.  </li>
<li> and lasts a very long time!</li>
<li> It has a slight tingle which you can get the same from some of the mint or cinnamon flavored glossed.</li>
<li> The effects of this highly over-hyped product last a mere few minutes and that&#x27;s not even plumping the lips -- it&#x27;s subjecting the lips to a burning sensation that is far from comfy.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive for such a small container of this, but it&#x27;s well worth</li>
<li> As for those who called it \\&quot;painful\\&quot;- seriously ladies, we can handle child birth but not a little tingle from cinnamon flavoring?</li>
<li> Great product, plumps your lips without those nasty injections, the small bottle lasts a long time.</li>
<li> The only drawback to the product is the effect does not last much past one to two hours, however if you haven&#x27;t moved past \\&quot;appearances\\&quot; in that amount of time...</li>
<li> This product on the other hand I could let her use.</li>
<li> I have a little lip, for me it works but for a short time, something like half an hour of less!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s definitely not worth the $15.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other lip plumpers, but this is the one that has worked!</li>
<li> Too expensive for such short term effects!!</li>
<li> I found that the gloss does give me a little plump and others have noticed when I use it.  </li>
<li> Stings a bit a first, but not as badly as others have written.</li>
<li> However I know they say results may vary, the irritation wasn&#x27;t as bad as the hit to the pocketbook for the results to only last MAYBE an hour!!   </li>
<li> I am not particularly overwhelmingly happy with the taste</li>

    <li> I bought this product in hopes that it would work for some decient amount of time.  However I know they say results may vary, the irritation wasn&#x27;t as bad as the hit to the pocketbook for the results to only last MAYBE an hour!!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this product again??     HELL NO.  Too expensive for such short term effects!!</li>
    <li> This product has a nice sheen for the 5 minutes it last. The tingle is not as intense as people claim (I think they work for Duwop). It has a slight tingle which you can get the same from some of the mint or cinnamon flavored glossed. I also saw no swell of my lips.</li>
    <li> Lip Venom by DuWop is very effective and you can feel it working within seconds. The ingredients stimulate circulation in the lips and increase volume slightly while bringing out the natural redness.&lt;br /&gt;For maximum effectiveness, it is best to treat lips at night with a moisturizer... I use Jojoba Oil. If lips are dehydrated this product will not help. The only drawback to the product is the effect does not last much past one to two hours, however if you haven&#x27;t moved past \\&quot;appearances\\&quot; in that amount of time... well.&lt;br /&gt;Remember the Best exercise for lips is Smiling...!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get something that claimed it would plump your lips and make them full.  At first I was put off by how small the actual product is.  It came it a pretty black silk bag and another paper tube, but when I got all the packaging open it was tiny....that&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t need much!  This stuff burns, but in the I&#x27;m making my lips plump kinda way.  Overall worth the burn and tiny size.  I&#x27;m still using it and after it wears off after a while your lips do feel nice and soft for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product, plumps your lips without those nasty injections, the small bottle lasts a long time.</li>

Really gives me that pouty sexy looking lips that I&#x27;ve been wanting. I&#x27;ve tried other lip plumpers, but this is the one that has worked! It&#x27;s expensive for such a small container of this, but it&#x27;s well worth the price- and lasts a very long time!</li>

    <li> I love this stuff. It moisturizes and adds just a hint of color. As for those who called it \\&quot;painful\\&quot;- seriously ladies, we can handle child birth but not a little tingle from cinnamon flavoring?</li>
    <li> Okay - &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got hooked on lip explosion because it worked for me - big red shiny lips...with a nice tingle and taste. It wasn&#x27;t sticky, and I was hooked. Loved the stuff. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, I guess the company that produced it discontinued it because of dissatisifed customers. I was bummed...but then the search continued for an adequate lip plumper. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried Sally Hansens (yuk) and some collagen otc products...none of which plumped, tingled, pinked or glossed my lips the way lip explosion did. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then, I came to Amazon and read all the \\&quot;adequate to awesome\\&quot; reviews about DuWop Lip Venom. I placed the order. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DuWop does not make my lips any pinker, or plumper...it is sticky...and it has a brush applicator (which I don&#x27;t like). What DuWop DOES have is a good tingle and a flavor reminiscent of pepper...no actually, it tastes like Raid Ant Spray smells...oh, and Sephora will send this little vial to you in a really cute pink cardboard tube and drawstring black satin bag. I guess this is supposed to leave you with the impression that you have received something - if not a quality product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok if you want alot of shine with a tingle.    It&#x27;s true it tingles your lips, but as far as plumping I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good gloss, but that&#x27;s about it.  your lips tingle, but i didn&#x27;t notice a change in thickness or appareance.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  The tingling feeling that occurs is not at all what I expected, I found it to be quite pleasant and not at all irritating.  I am not particularly overwhelmingly happy with the taste but it is tolerable.  The gloss is very shiny and goes on well with the brush applicator that is provided.  I found the tube to be small and the price a bit high but a little of the gloss goes a long long way.  This tube should last me awhile as I do not use it every single day.  I found that the gloss does give me a little plump and others have noticed when I use it.  I expected a bit more plump but am very happy with the results.  I would and will buy this product again as I love the tingling feeling that it gives.</li>
    <li> This stuff is not as good as I expected. I have used other lip plumpers in the past &amp; havent been able to let my little girl use them because they work so well &amp; they have that lingering burn. This product on the other hand I could let her use.</li>
    <li> I have a little lip, for me it works but for a short time, something like half an hour of less!</li>
    <li> You get the tingle, and shiny lips, that&#x27;s all, I get better results from Carmex.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t really plump your lips up that much.  The stining feels quite nice, but it was pretty much a waste of money for such a small bottle.</li>
    <li> This product didnt really &#x27;plump&#x27; my lips in any way. In fact, the first time I used it my lips just burned for a while. I know plumping stuff is just an allergic reaction to make your lips plump up but I just got the reaction with no plump. I do have to say though, that did stop after about two tries and in general this is just a fantastic gloss. I keep using it b/c the smell is AMAZING. I love spicey-like smells and thats not a typical smell in lip stuff and thats what this product has. I LOVE the smell and the gloss is great quality. So for me, the product didn&#x27;t work for what I wanted it to but it&#x27;s still a great product for general use.</li>
    <li> It does not work.  It just makes your lips &lt;br /&gt;shiny &amp; vaseline makes your lips shiny and costs &lt;br /&gt;a whole lot less.</li>
    <li> Great product that comes very nicely packaged and more than meets your expectations.  I showed all my friends and let them try it.  They loved it too!</li>
    <li> For anyone expecting for their lips to plump up... forget about buying this product.  The most you will experience is a stinging and a slightly increased color to your lips. It&#x27;s definitely not worth the $15.</li>
