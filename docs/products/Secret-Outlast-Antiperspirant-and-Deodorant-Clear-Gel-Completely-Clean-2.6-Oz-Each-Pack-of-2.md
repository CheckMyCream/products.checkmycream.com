      <li>If you don&#x27;t sweat much this would be the perfect choice.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this product from BzzAgent and agreed to leave honest reviews of this product.</li>
      <li>and well I&#x27;m loving this product.</li>

      <li>Could not be more pleased with this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>.will go and buy again and again :)&lt;</li>
      <li>Just don’t expect any magic tricks.</li>
      <li>This works better as a deodorant than an antiperspirant.  </li>
      <li>and the gel comes out top.</li>
      <li>mostly happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband and I going out hiking/hunting and occasionally I love to go out dancing.</li>
      <li>Just to be on the safe side I apply it twice a day</li>
      <li>/&gt;White Marks:&lt;br /&gt;None to be seen which is lovely</li>
      <li>but I don’t love it.</li>
      <li>The product comes out the top dispenser by twisting the bottom portion of it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First Impressions:&lt;br /&gt;The very first thing I noticed (after wondering if it had melted in my mailbox) was the strong but pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;#epic24 MAYBE:&lt;br /&gt;Secret will keep me dry and odor free all day, which is great!</li>
      <li>to many stores i about it and found there easily , that is a very positive thing too .&lt;br</li>
      <li>Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m a huge fan of the roll on deodorant.</li>
      <li>I got to try this product for free and</li>
      <li>However, as a BzzAgent I received this product for free.</li>
      <li>Being a BzzAgent,  I received the produt for free as part of a promotion.  </li>
      <li>No white marks, great protection....</li>
      <li>It also did not leave white streaks on my shirts which will be great for the summer time.</li>
      <li>I was given this product free from bzzagent to review.</li>
      <li>So far so good;</li>
      <li>so make sure you don&#x27;t put it on while wearing your clothes for the day because in my experience, it leaks right through.</li>
      <li>Sure, if the price is right.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Outlast Completely Clean.  </li>
      <li>In addition, the gel goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>It can handle a normal 24 just fine and mostly the #epic24</li>
      <li>This is true.  </li>
      <li>and I work full time.</li>
      <li>It kept me sweat free and smelling fresh between showers.</li>
      <li>, this has been true to it&#x27;s word.</li>
      <li>a great deodorant tht keeps you felling dry and fresh all day.</li>
      <li>I have noticed a significant decrease in sweating ynder my arms and in the rare occasions that I do sweat, there is literally no sweat smell at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because I&#x27;ve found a new dedorant!</li>
      <li>It makes me feel clean and fresh all day</li>
      <li>This is a decent product and I will surely continue to use it until it is gone.</li>
      <li>am a loyal and long-time (2 decade)</li>
      <li>This is a decent product and I will surely continue to use it until it is gone.</li>
      <li>This deodorant is pretty good, the smell wasnt overwhelming and it worked like a typical deodorant should.</li>
      <li>you for letting me try such amazing</li>
      <li>but I rarely wear sleeveless tops or dresses</li>
      <li>I work in manufacturing and it stays quite warm and this just did not stand up to the performance of my regular deodorant.   </li>
      <li>since I used a clear gel, I made sure to read the instructions - 2-3 clicks, then apply.</li>
      <li>Honestly, the only time I&#x27;ve had to reapply during the day is if I take a shower after the gym in the afternoon.  </li>
      <li>It helps me not sweat and keeps me smelling fresh.</li>
      <li>This particular product has a light scent that is not over powering or obnoxious.</li>
      <li>This did dry rather quickly (faster than I expected/remembered) and the strong fragrance faded to a more appropriate light scent after a few minutes.</li>
      <li>I received a complimentary full size version of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from Bzz Agent and thought it would be an awesome product to try for my busy lifestyle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t love the scent...would prolly try the powder scent next time.</li>
      <li>so I was excited to try the clear gel.</li>
      <li>My solid goes on easy, no time to dry, smells nice without being super fragrant, and keeps my underarms dry and smelling fresh all day unless it gets super hot</li>
      <li>I was really impressed with how well the Secret Outlast Clear gel worked.</li>
      <li>invisible solid user with a strong preference to wards Degree.</li>
      <li>its a clear gel that goes on smoothly and dries quickly and leaves you with dry, fresh under arms.</li>
      <li>I was able to dress immediately after use because it dried quickly.  </li>
      <li>I typically use solid stick antiperspirant because it dries fast and works great for me.</li>
      <li>I love my active lifestyle, and this is the first deodorant (men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s) that has been able to keep me dry and comfortable even in the middle of summer.  </li>
      <li>Whereas, if they’d claimed 24 hours I would be telling a different story; I would be telling you that on all but one or two rather exceptional occasions it kept up to its word and protected me ALL DAY LONG.</li>
      <li>I thought the completely clean scent was a little strong and smelled like chemicals.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t tell how much you are putting on.</li>
      <li>Turns out it was a bit much but not by a lot.</li>
      <li>I guess I am on the move too much.  </li>
      <li>I found that two twists of the bottom gave a reasonable amount of product to use each application.  </li>
      <li>It also seems to be really long-lasting.  </li>
      <li>and this was with using twice a much product as recommended.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t have much of a reference</li>
      <li>It dries fast and it really is all day protection.</li>
      <li>I never really liked gels, but this one is good.  </li>
      <li>It does minimize sweating, but I prefer the Secret Outlast Invisible Solid for great antiperspirant!  </li>
      <li>yes will sure get sweat , but to stop that i used the perfect solution , my secret outlast clear gel#MomHack amazing in removing of odor , amazing smell , no ruined cloths , fast to dry , and hard to go away#epic48 , best protection .&lt;br /&gt;high recommended to family and friends and all moms, like i see a women standing in the store and confused into which deodorant to pick , i jumped and told her about my experience with secret outlast clear gel  </li>
      <li>But, honestly, I see the future of my underarms back with their loyal Degree invisible solid which has all the same great benefits as this clear gel without that wet goopy feeling I cannot seem to get used to.</li>
      <li>But, honestly, I see the future of my underarms back with their loyal Degree invisible solid which has all the same great benefits as this clear gel without that wet goopy feeling I cannot seem to get used to.</li>
      <li>I have been exercising and walking more due a work wellness program, and have had no issues.&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first, the smell of the deoderant was overwhelming but then after a few hours I had under arm odor and that does not happen with solids.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a Secret Clinical Strength user, so I was willing to try Secret Outlast as a part of the BzzAgent program, where I am able to try products, talk about them, give out coupons, and write up the experiences.  I have used the Outlast Completely Clean.  I have been exercising and walking more due a work wellness program, and have had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Secret Outlast® does dry fast.  There is no need to wait to put on clothes after application.&lt;br /&gt;• Due to the water-based formula, it does permeate sweat glands faster that I can tell compared to other solids I have tried; including the Clinical Strength.&lt;br /&gt;• I have not had any stains, but some reviewers complained about using with whites.  However, any deodorant seems to stain whites.&lt;br /&gt;• I can feel it keeping me dry.  I feel sweaty, but not under my arms.  I have not had to resort to my backup deodorant)&lt;br /&gt;•  It does last longer, but does not last a full 48 hours for me.  I guess I am on the move too much.  But as I use daily-I have not had to reapply!</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this deodorant! Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m a huge fan of the roll on deodorant. For years it was the only product I would use. It was hard for me to try something different since nothing seemed to work for me. However, as a BzzAgent I received this product for free. I gave it a shot and well I&#x27;m loving this product. It literally keeps me dry all day. Just to be on the safe side I apply it twice a day and I honestly feel very confident about myself. Secret Outlast Completely Clean is my new favorite!</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of gel deodorants. In the past I have bought them and then used them for a day or two and then thrown them away. I love this product! It does not sting after I shave. It dries fast and it really is all day protection. I cannot confirm whether or not it is 48 hour protection because I shower every day. This particular product has a light scent that is not over powering or obnoxious. I would buy this product over the standard white deodorants but this is the only gel deodorant that I would every buy. I did not purchase this product, it was given to me as a gift to try and give my honest opinion via BZZAGENT.com but I would not give 5 stars if I did not LOVE the product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deodorant! Unlike some gels this dedorant goes on silky smooth, not sticky,  burn free, dries in seconds leaving no white marks behind! Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel even holds up after working out at the gym! I received this product as part of a promotion from the brand am I&#x27;m glad I did because I&#x27;ve found a new dedorant!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with how well the Secret Outlast Clear gel worked. Im usually not a fan of gel deodorant because of the wetness and the time it takes to dry. The secret Outlast dried in no time at all. It also did not leave white streaks on my shirts which will be great for the summer time. Secret Outlast also kept me dry and feeling fresh throughout the day. I would recommend this deodorant to anyone. (Bzzagent sample given for review)</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free and here&#x27;s what I decided about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Goes on clear! Great for using with tank tops or dresses in the summer&lt;br /&gt;Works all day... even when you&#x27;re sitting outside in 90+ degress, you&#x27;ll still not stink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to wear it under a shift with sleeves, wait for it to dry or it will just rub off onto your shirt leaving you without anything on, learned that the hard way! I wish the bottom left a little instructions on that part... as I had never used a clear gel before.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a promotion from BzzAgent and Secret. I did not like it at all. You can&#x27;t tell how much you are putting on. You also have to wait for it to dry, its really wet. At first, the smell of the deoderant was overwhelming but then after a few hours I had under arm odor and that does not happen with solids. This did not work for me and I did not like the application at all.</li>
    <li> Living in the desert, in the middle of summer, finding a deodorant, is sometimes hard. This deodorant, definitely works well, I can still smell it at the end of the day. Before using this deodorant i used clinical strength deodorant, and sometimes even had to reply in the middle of the day. I can even change my shirt multiple times after putting on my deodorant, and not have to worry about white sport or rescue that other clear deodorant leaves behind sometimes. I did receive this deodorant as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> i have long days 90 degrees and 2 babies , shopping , going to the park yes will sure get sweat , but to stop that i used the perfect solution , my secret outlast clear gel#MomHack amazing in removing of odor , amazing smell , no ruined cloths , fast to dry , and hard to go away#epic48 , best protection .&lt;br /&gt;high recommended to family and friends and all moms, like i see a women standing in the store and confused into which deodorant to pick , i jumped and told her about my experience with secret outlast clear gel  .will go and buy again and again :)&lt;br /&gt;thank you for letting me try such amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wear long jackets and i always used to worry about they get white stains because they are hard to clean , talk about making my life easier .&lt;br /&gt;went to many stores i about it and found there easily , that is a very positive thing too .&lt;br /&gt;because you never want to get out of stock of you favorite deodorant.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a part off a bzz campaign, and I must say I am impressed with this deodorant. its a clear gel that goes on smoothly and dries quickly and leaves you with dry, fresh under arms. Living in Florida this is a great deodorant tht keeps you felling dry and fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I am a busy mom and I work full time. I get about an hour to myself every night. Sometimes, I don&#x27;t have time to shower every day and often skip a day or two. I received a complimentary full size version of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from Bzz Agent and thought it would be an awesome product to try for my busy lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t totally sold on the gel aspect of it, however. I typically use solid stick antiperspirant because it dries fast and works great for me. So on my first day of trying this product, I thought it felt icky. It went on wet and I had to wait some time for it to dry. But it worked great! It kept me sweat free and smelling fresh between showers. The more I used it, the more I liked it. I don&#x27;t get that icky feeling when I put it on anymore and can&#x27;t argue with the results. And it doesn&#x27;t mark up your clothes. I definitely will consider purchasing this product in the future.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is pretty good, the smell wasnt overwhelming and it worked like a typical deodorant should. I usually use the invisible solid from secret so I was excited to try the clear gel. It works a little differently than the solid because one click really goes a long way vs the same amount in the solid. It comes out very wet and gooey so make sure you don&#x27;t put it on while wearing your clothes for the day because in my experience, it leaks right through. All you have to do is wait a few minutes and it&#x27;ll dry. It lasts just about the same as the solid although it claims to last 48 hours, I only tried one day.  I was given this product free from bzzagent to review.</li>
    <li> Background:&lt;br /&gt;#gotitfree at bzzagent.com.&lt;br /&gt;I am a loyal and long-time (2 decade) invisible solid user with a strong preference to wards Degree. My solid goes on easy, no time to dry, smells nice without being super fragrant, and keeps my underarms dry and smelling fresh all day unless it gets super hot or I&#x27;m exerting myself more than usual - my job is about half on my feet and half at my desk, my home life is the same, and a rarely exercise so I am not typically in a situation where I need clinical strength protection. I recently tried a Suave brand solid which smells lovely but falls severely short of the protection I&#x27;ve become accustom to with my trusty Degree.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I long ago switched away from clear gels because I was not a fan of the goopy wet feeling you get when putting it on; and I&#x27;m still not but I decided to give Secrets Outlast Clear Gel a fair try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Impressions:&lt;br /&gt;The very first thing I noticed (after wondering if it had melted in my mailbox) was the strong but pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1:&lt;br /&gt;As it has been a while since I used a clear gel, I made sure to read the instructions - 2-3 clicks, then apply. It took about 20 clicks before anything came up the first time and when it did it seemed like an awful lot but I don&#x27;t have much of a reference so I went with it. Turns out it was a bit much but not by a lot. It immediately reminded me why I walked away from clear gels so long ago as that goopy wet feeling is still off-putting to me. This did dry rather quickly (faster than I expected/remembered) and the strong fragrance faded to a more appropriate light scent after a few minutes. So far so good; mostly happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update After 2 Weeks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clicks:&lt;br /&gt;Each day presents a different number of &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; that are required to get an approximately equivalent amount of gel - somewhere between nothing and goop falling over onto itself. This is mildly annoying, certainly not a deal-breaker but something I never had to even think about with my invisible solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That goopy feeling:&lt;br /&gt;Once applied, it does dry quickly but not instantly - I have to hold my arms out away from my body for a minute to minimize the uncomfortable feeling it gives me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White Marks:&lt;br /&gt;None to be seen which is lovely but I rarely wear sleeveless tops or dresses so this is of limited utility to me. Though next time I do, I will definitely be reaching for this clear gel over my invisible solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#epic24 MAYBE:&lt;br /&gt;Secret will keep me dry and odor free all day, which is great! But, the effectiveness peters out around 24 hours – short of the advertised #epic48 protection.&lt;br /&gt;I have had an #epic24 or three and maybe one #epic48 since using this product and it falls short. It can handle a normal 24 just fine and mostly the #epic24 but stops there. One hot and busy day it didn’t even make it to hour # 2; I was already sweating though it.&lt;br /&gt;One day at less than 32 (non-epic) hours since my last application (no judging) and I could feel the slight wetness and smell the odor - not awful but noticeable upon sniffing my pits. I’ve yet to see it last for a full 48 hours even with my moderate activity level.&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, if they hadn’t claimed 48 hour protection, I wouldn’t be so disappointed. The fact that they over-stated the capabilities and over-claimed the protection means that when it doesn’t live up to the expectations I am let down. Whereas, if they’d claimed 24 hours I would be telling a different story; I would be telling you that on all but one or two rather exceptional occasions it kept up to its word and protected me ALL DAY LONG. But alas, the claim for a full 48 hours means I cannot endorse this statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I do like this product but I don’t love it. I am unlikely to purchase it over my trusty Degree stick next time I need to re-stock.&lt;br /&gt;I could overlook the wet goopy feeling if thedeodorant/antiperspirant performance was unmatched by an invisible solid. In my opinion, that is not the case. Secret Outlast Clear Gel will keep me fresh and dry all day - but that is where it ends. This is a decent product and I will surely continue to use it until it is gone. But, honestly, I see the future of my underarms back with their loyal Degree invisible solid which has all the same great benefits as this clear gel without that wet goopy feeling I cannot seem to get used to. The only thing this might have over my solid is the lack of white marks but for me that is not enough to sway me by itself.rspirant performance was unmatched by an invisible solid.

    <li> I live in New Orleans, which is about as hot and humid as it can possibly get. When I was given the chance to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free thanks to Bzzagent, I was pretty stoked. In this climate, free deodorant is a win. I&#x27;ve been using this now for about a week, and I have to say, this has been true to it&#x27;s word. I have had no white marks or spots from my deodorant show up on any of my clothing, and I&#x27;ve worn sleeveless tops almost daily. In addition, the gel goes on smoothly and dries quickly. I normally use a Dove solid, but I am fairly certain I will be switching brands after this sample. I am also a mom, and chasing two kids under three can make you sweat a lot (mine, anyway!) I have noticed a significant decrease in sweating ynder my arms and in the rare occasions that I do sweat, there is literally no sweat smell at all. The only thing I can smell is the deodorant! And that is the only issue to me, and why I dropped this down to four stars. I don&#x27;t like the smell. It almost has a chemical scent mixed in with  a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent. I am definitely going to check out other products in this line to see if another scent is better. In all, fantastic product I will likely purchase in the future. Again, I was given this product for free by Secret to try through a Bzzagent campaign.</li>
    <li> This works better as a deodorant than an antiperspirant.  It works great for day to day wear, but if you are going to work up a sweat this is not for you.  It does minimize sweating, but I prefer the Secret Outlast Invisible Solid for great antiperspirant!  If you don&#x27;t sweat much this would be the perfect choice. It does dry quickly and does not leave white marks. I was not a fan of the sticky feeling it left if I was starting to sweat, but it would go away after a few minutes. I work in manufacturing and it stays quite warm and this just did not stand up to the performance of my regular deodorant.   I received a sample of this product from BzzAgent and agreed to leave honest reviews of this product.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of a promotion.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and WOW!  It has been great!  No white marks, great protection....I was able to wear a sleeveless dress to a recent wedding and was not self conscious about raising my arms like I usually am.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time fan of Secret products, but, this is the first time I have tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel.  I received this product free to try and was hesitant to try a gel since I typically find them wet &amp; sticky.  I thought the completely clean scent was a little strong and smelled like chemicals.  The performance of the product though was amazing!  It lived up to the claims that it gives you all day protection without perspiration or odor.  I will definitely use this product again, but, try a different scent next time.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant!! very easy to use turn the knob at bottom and the gel comes out top. I use 1 to 3 clicks per under arm daily. It makes me feel clean and fresh all day no matter what i do! the scent was not over powering. As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I don&#x27;t use Secret as my primary deodorant but I&#x27;m happy to say it will be my go to brand from now on! Normally I&#x27;m not a sweater and during the day I have an 8-5 desk job. My husband and I going out hiking/hunting and occasionally I love to go out dancing. I&#x27;m always worried about how I might smell afterward. With Secret Clear Gel I don&#x27;t have to worry. We walked roughly 20 miles this last week while out hunting. I applied the Secret Clear Gel in the morning before I left home and many hours later when I arrived home a hot sweaty mess I was still in good hands :) I love how it goes on wet, yet dries in seconds and also NO white marks!! Definitely going to be my next deodorant purchase. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> In michigan its 82 on average of not higher. The free sample bzzagent and secret sent to me to test out has held up so well! It helps me not sweat and keeps me smelling fresh. I am honestly switching from dove to secret. Very impressed. Keep up the good work secret!</li>
    <li> I’m not too picky about my deodorants so I was happy to give Secret Outlast Clear Gel a try.  Being a BzzAgent,  I received the produt for free as part of a promotion.  I’ve used this the last three weeks.  It has a very pleasant, lite, clean scent and is easy to use.  The product comes out the top dispenser by twisting the bottom portion of it.  I found that two twists of the bottom gave a reasonable amount of product to use each application.  I was able to dress immediately after use because it dried quickly.  Secret Outast Clear Gel claims to not leave white marks.  This is true.  Being clear, how could it?  It also claims to offer 48-hour odor protection with just one twist.  Twice I attempted to go 48 hours without reapplying to see if it held up to its claim, but couldn’t.  My clothes and I stunk after 36 hours both times- and this was with using twice a much product as recommended.  These were normal days without working out or doing anything strenuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel works fine for me as a 24-hour antiperspirant/deodorant.  It works just like other ones I’ve used- no better or worse.  However, it does not hold up to its claim of 48-hour odor protection.  Knowing that, would I buy it again?  Sure, if the price is right.  Just don’t expect any magic tricks.</li>
    <li> Received this from BzzAgent to try out. Usually not a gel fan, but this stuff actually works really well. Lasts all day through an 8 hour workday and 1-2 hours at the gym! And no white marks on my clothes. Don&#x27;t love the scent...would prolly try the powder scent next time.</li>
    <li> Could not be more pleased with this deodorant.  I&#x27;ve used men&#x27;s deodorant for years because the women&#x27;s didn&#x27;t cut it, but even my Old Spice Swagger failed to make the cut on a fairly frequent basis.  I&#x27;m expecting with two toddlers and home, and I exercise 60-90 minutes almost every day.  I love my active lifestyle, and this is the first deodorant (men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s) that has been able to keep me dry and comfortable even in the middle of summer.  Honestly, the only time I&#x27;ve had to reapply during the day is if I take a shower after the gym in the afternoon.  Even after a rigorous workout, my underarms are still dry and soft while the rest of my body is pouring sweat.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
    <li> I have primarily used Secret as my deodorant for years, but it was the white stick.  I never really liked gels, but this one is good.  I got a sample as part of a promotion, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it&#x27;s very neutral.  It also seems to be really long-lasting.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I like it!</li>
