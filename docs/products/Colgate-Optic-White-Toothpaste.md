### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best tooth paste and the best price here on Amazon!</li>
      <li>The size is perfect for use at home or traveling.  </li>
      <li>Very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>and I loved the deal!</li>
      <li>Great flavor.</li>
      <li>Great toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Great taste great smell.</li>
      <li>Another note about Sparkling Mint is that it is really a bright mint flavor.</li>
      <li>Loved it.</li>
      <li>This twin pack is a good deal.</li>
      <li>I got this in Sparkling Mint as I wanted a very strong flavor.  </li>
      <li>it was very cheap compared to what you pay in the city</li>
      <li>Love the way it brightens up my teeth.</li>
      <li>Love this paste.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste...</li>
      <li>Same quality as you would expect from Colgate, consider this the best toothpaste I have used.  </li>
      <li>This product claims to whiten your teeth 2 or more shades, however I used it for 2 months and the appearance of my teeth didnt change.  </li>
      <li>I love Colgate toothpastes, but this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Really potent stuff,</li>
      <li>We are completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>I am a toothpaste snob and have always bought the best such as Rembrandt, Mentadent, or Crest 3D because good toothpaste (including a Sonicare toothbrush) is so much better/cheaper than dental work.  </li>
      <li>all in all, if you brush regularly, it&#x27;s a great alternative/upkeep to professional whitening treatments at a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>I was not expecting much, but after using it, I am so impressed with this that this will become my new toothpaste.</li>
      <li>The taste isn&#x27;t too strong, but leaves my mouth feeling clean with no aftertaste.</li>
      <li>Your mouth will feel really sparkling and cool which I kind of like, but some may find the flavor too strong.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a fairly significant difference in two weeks.</li>
      <li>I used this with Crest 3d White Arctic Fresh and my teeth have greatly whitened</li>
      <li>Whitens and your mouth feels really clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far after a week I am licking it very much, it gives off this heat in the mouth when brushing and feels like it does quite a good job.</li>
      <li>Tastes good, whitens, and has the necessary anti-cavity fighters.</li>
      <li>Very nice, cool minty flavor, kind of your standard toothpaste flavor... and a texture that is not so standard.</li>
      <li>It has a lot of silica in it, so it feels more abrasive than others, but it does the trick (along with some nominal amounts of hydrogen peroxide) to actually whiten my teeth as good or better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>,the smell I liked,gives You the feeling of fresh teeth ))))).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that Colgate has done their homework, but it is too early to tell if the additional silica will result in increased enamel wear.  </li>
      <li>Additionally, I&#x27;ve found with a lot of toothpastes such as Crest Pro Health that they contain some kind of ingredient (one of the gingivitis or plaque chemicals) that tends to dissolve my mouth.</li>
      <li>Would buy again if the price is right.</li>
      <li>My husband and I really like this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in whiting, though.</li>
      <li>really whitened my teeth within 1 weeek of usage.</li>
      <li>In other words it helped to remove more \\&quot;stains\\&quot; than non-whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other than that, it seems okay.</li>
      <li>This stuff is a bit stronger than your typical toothpaste and its still competitive price wise compared to standard toothe paste</li>
      <li>It also comes with a relatively high amount of fluoride at 0.76%.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>But maybe I&#x27;ve already got my \\&quot;normal white\\&quot; color</li>
      <li>I will be looking for a new toothpaste.</li>
      <li>While this is my favorite toothpaste, I&#x27;m really not sure it whitens anything.  </li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m going to finish this tube, and don&#x27;t think I would buy another one - this is not for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>It really whitens in a short time!</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>Well, this Colgate Optic White does not have that ingredient yet cleans my teeth really well.</li>
      <li>Would definitely purchase this product again and highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It left my teeth very sensitive.  </li>
      <li>Keeps the teeth clean and definitely a little whiter than regular toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I drink tea all day long, so it may work better for someone with less existing stains and/or less to contend with on a day-to-day basis...</li>

    <li> This toothpaste tastes pretty bad. It&#x27;s not the worst, but it&#x27;s not good either. Other than that, it seems okay. I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in whiting, though.</li>
    <li> I love Colgate toothpastes, but this one is my favorite. It really whitens in a short time! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> After discovering this Colgate brand, I find I&#x27;m buying it exclusively. Tastes good, whitens, and has the necessary anti-cavity fighters. This twin pack is a good deal.</li>
    <li> Love this paste. Great taste great smell. Love the way it brightens up my teeth. Would buy again if the price is right. Thank you</li>
    <li> Same quality as you would expect from Colgate, consider this the best toothpaste I have used.  Would purchase again! Loved it.</li>
    <li> I got this in Sparkling Mint as I wanted a very strong flavor.  Really potent stuff, but it does the job.  Whitens and your mouth feels really clean.</li>
    <li> We like this toothpaste a lot, it&#x27;s keeps our teeth white, and it doesn&#x27;t break the bank! Like any toothpaste with whitener, I don&#x27;t see drastic results but I also don&#x27;t see my teeth getting less white. I have sensitive teeth and this brand does not bother me.</li>
    <li> While this is my favorite toothpaste, I&#x27;m really not sure it whitens anything.  I actually subscribe to this product and the price is comparable to the grocery store.  The size is perfect for use at home or traveling.  The taste isn&#x27;t too strong, but leaves my mouth feeling clean with no aftertaste.</li>
    <li> Best tooth paste and the best price here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Very nice, cool minty flavor, kind of your standard toothpaste flavor... and a texture that is not so standard.

    <li> Well, It did not whiten my teeth as I expected,but very very little  improvements I noticed,the smell I liked,gives You the feeling of fresh teeth ))))).</li>
    <li> The add claims twin tubes, 8 oz.&lt;br /&gt;It is actually two tubes of 4 oz.&lt;br /&gt;That is purposely deceptive!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t recommend this seller</li>
    <li> I used this with Crest 3d White Arctic Fresh and my teeth have greatly whitened i feel it is from the toothpaste because i have friends whom use that same mouth wash with no success</li>
    <li> Keeps the teeth clean and definitely a little whiter than regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste... and I loved the deal! it was very cheap compared to what you pay in the city</li>
    <li> I am a toothpaste snob and have always bought the best such as Rembrandt, Mentadent, or Crest 3D because good toothpaste (including a Sonicare toothbrush) is so much better/cheaper than dental work.  The Optic White looks unimpressive as just a plain white paste. No stripes, twin tubes, sparkles, or any flavor-bursting crystals or strips. I was not expecting much, but after using it, I am so impressed with this that this will become my new toothpaste. It has a lot of silica in it, so it feels more abrasive than others, but it does the trick (along with some nominal amounts of hydrogen peroxide) to actually whiten my teeth as good or better than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.  It also comes with a relatively high amount of fluoride at 0.76%.  This is compared to the Crest 3D at 0.243% (or triple) while the Crest Pro Health lists 0.454%.    Additionally, I&#x27;ve found with a lot of toothpastes such as Crest Pro Health that they contain some kind of ingredient (one of the gingivitis or plaque chemicals) that tends to dissolve my mouth. With those other toothpastes, I get an annoying slough-off of a layer of mouth skin. I asked my dentist, and she said it is one of the chemicals and likely an irritant to my gums. Well, this Colgate Optic White does not have that ingredient yet cleans my teeth really well. I&#x27;m sure that Colgate has done their homework, but it is too early to tell if the additional silica will result in increased enamel wear.  Another note about Sparkling Mint is that it is really a bright mint flavor. Your mouth will feel really sparkling and cool which I kind of like, but some may find the flavor too strong.  I would highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. I definitely see improvement in whiteness appearance. Great flavor. Very happy with the product. Would definitely purchase this product again and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product claims to whiten your teeth 2 or more shades, however I used it for 2 months and the appearance of my teeth didnt change.  It left my teeth very sensitive.  I will be looking for a new toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a bit stronger than your typical toothpaste and its still competitive price wise compared to standard toothe paste so I figured lets give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far after a week I am licking it very much, it gives off this heat in the mouth when brushing and feels like it does quite a good job.</li>
    <li> My husband and I really like this toothpaste. It whitens our teeth and my husband claims that it is helping keep plaque from forming on his teeth. The hydrogen peroxide in other toothpastes has caused my gums to turn white and fall apart (in between my front teeth) but I have not had a problem like this with Colgate Optic White. We are completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been used this toothpaste within 4 weeks already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;It really whitened my teeth within 1 weeek of usage. In other words it helped to remove more \\&quot;stains\\&quot; than non-whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;No progress after 1 week of usage. But maybe I&#x27;ve already got my \\&quot;normal white\\&quot; color so the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t whiten more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;My teeth always have been sensitive, but after usage of this toothpaste they became VERY sensitive, and also my gums became painful. So, I&#x27;m going to finish this tube, and don&#x27;t think I would buy another one - this is not for sensitive teeth.</li>
