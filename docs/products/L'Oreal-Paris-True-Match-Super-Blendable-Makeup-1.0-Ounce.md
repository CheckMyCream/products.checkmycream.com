    <li> my go to foundation love it nice coverage and cheaper then high end products</li>
    <li> Hate it pure garbage DO NOT waste your time or money and be prepared to be added to a scheduled buy it again list so every time you log into amazon your home page is filled with cosmetics from L&amp;#34;oreal..  Oh and on top of that she didnt like it and my new GF keeps asking me why I buy make-up??  Save your money and sanity and go to MACY&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is simply amazing. It wears great and lasted all day! It does not cling to any dry patches I may have. I used the Loreal website to get color matched and the color is perfect. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I usually use high end, expensive makeup but decided to try this after watching a how to video.  I love this stuff, it&#x27;s easy to put on, goes on evenly and I mix it with my MAC to make my products last longer.</li>
    <li> Exactly as it says on the tin- super blendable, and the suntan has an extremely fresh and vibrant colour- a little coin sized amount is enough for the whole face. Careful not to put too much or you&#x27;ll look like someone turned the saturation wayyyy up on a photo!</li>
    <li> Real nice color match better than their n7 which is my color but they seem to have improved</li>
    <li> the color darker that what i excpet from searching and seeing here</li>
    <li> This is one of the best foundation products I have ever bought ever! And i&#x27;m not one to brag about anyone&#x27;s product. It keeps my face flawless all day long and I do have long days. I live in the Caribbean and this heat usually meat my foundation off, but not since L&#x27;Oreal True Match. It brought back the old me, I&#x27;m so loving getting up and putting this product on. I got this on my subscribe and save, it is worth buying over and over again.</li>
    <li> This is a great foundation. My only suggestion is to make sure you know what shade to get because ordering off the internet, you can&#x27;t test it out.</li>
    <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;But it dlivri it is very leta</li>
    <li> I love this foundation!  The color I got is true to my color and the formula is great.  It is easily blendable and buildable.  It stays on all day and I will definitely be buying this foundation again.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation and the price was better on amazon then in the store.</li>
    <li> Does not give me acne.</li>
    <li> Color match is dead on. Could be a longer lasting.</li>
    <li> So far the only brand that I have found that is somewhat close to my skin tone. I have oily skin so I have to use a powder to set it. But overall, will last about 5-6 hours.</li>
