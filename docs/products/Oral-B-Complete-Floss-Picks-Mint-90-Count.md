<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> and that is why people use it. I don&#x27;t like that other brand that has instead of just a thread it has like a little sheet. No, the thread/string like this one is much better.</li>
    <li> These floss picks are good if you are in a hurry, but if you are looking for the best floss Reach Total Care Floss 90 Yard http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NATQPA/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_12 is the best floss out.</li>
    <li> Floss was thin-medium, minty, and easy to position. Edge was pointed so you can use that as a toothpick if you like. Doesn&#x27;t feel wasteful because it was so cheap anyway.</li>
    <li> I hate hate hate flossing. These floss picks are so easy to use, i don&#x27;t mind flossing twice a day, and my dentist could even tell a difference at my last appointment. These are nice to travel with to, and the pick on the end is nice for making sure there is nothing in between your teeth after a meal.</li>
    <li> I keep these with me at all times.  I find myself eating a lot more veggies lately and these things are small and discrete and great to keep in your purse or at your desk just in case you find yourself with something in your teeth after your lunch.  Love these things</li>
    <li> I purchased these from Amazon proper through Subscribe and Save. I will continue to do so - they make flossing easy and the price point was good when I bought them.</li>
    <li> I love these!  I use them on my 7 year old son and there are plenty to go around in this bag.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of different dental floss and tooth products.  I&#x27;m kind of a tooth care junkie.  I&#x27;ve bought floss picks like this before and they&#x27;re awfully uncomfortable because the floss/pick gets stuck between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;My bicuspids and molars are \\&quot;tight\\&quot;, meaning there&#x27;s very little space in between the teeth.  The floss gets stuck between the teeth and it&#x27;s difficult to pull the pick out.  It&#x27;s dangerous!  I feel I have to pull the pick so hard I&#x27;m gonna pull my crowns off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it for the upper and lower incisors, but for the bicuspids and molars, FORGET it!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could remember the name of the last picks I bought.  They must&#x27;ve been waxed because they slid thru my teeth easily.&lt;br /&gt;Not these!  I do NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> I like firmly strung floss that remains tight when used. I also prefer strong floss that actually can be dragged across the tooth surfaces, removing particles and cleaning without stretching and becoming loose in the holder. I have used the “silk” type in the past they just feel like they are polishing the tooth and not removing anything. These are not bad, would like a mint taste.</li>
    <li> Its floss on a stick not much to be said, cleans well and makes the job easier.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used better Oral-B floss picks but nothing that beats the price on these guys. The floss itself is very thin so can be sharp but gets in between teeth very well.</li>
    <li> Not too thick and waxed so doesn&#x27;t get stuck in tight spaces or on caps, crowns or veneers.  Very quick and easy to use.  Please not that you must use regular floss too because this type does NOT wrap around each tooth as it is being used.  But this is a great product when you&#x27;re at work or out, or in a hurry.  You should still floss once per day when using this (or more).</li>
    <li> One of the best floss picks I used in a while. Small and easy to care on the go .</li>
    <li> These are so thin that fit in between ANY of my teeth (even the ones all the way in the back), and they strong enough to break.&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, they can leave your breath smelling good due to the mint coating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are highly worth the price. In fact, they are better than the more expensive ones I have tried from stores.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than getting them from pharmacies or groceries. And heavier mint flavors than most other brands I used before. The thread is kind of lose though, but not really a big deal.</li>
    <li> As I have very very tight gaps between my teeth, I must use a robust pick to floss. Its a little too difficult to hold the floss in my hands and reach all my teeth, and these hold up even on my tightest molars. Added bonus is the fresh mint flavor, though it could be stronger or last longer. While these are more expensive than most brands, they have meet my needs admirably.</li>
    <li> The problem with floss products of this type is the floss tends to be flimsy. Not these babies. Love them.</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and save and it is a good product. Good floss and cleans my teeth well!</li>
    <li> cheap and works better than the rite aid or pharmacy brand floss picks. i bought 3 and keep them in my car, in my locker, and in my bathroom for guests.</li>
    <li> These floss picks sort of remind me of Dentek floss picks. They are OK but not as nice as the original Oral-B Floss picks I buy. They are not as smooth and kind of get stuck in between at least our teeth as we have tighter teeth. I noticed why and saw that these are made in China where the original ones we buy are made in USA. Guess we get what we pay for. In the future I think I will go back to buying Oral-B Advantage Floss picks instead. Thanks for reading!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, comfortable, versatile. I&#x27;ve used these daily for over a year now and they&#x27;ve become my preferred method of flossing.</li>
    <li> Thought these would make a nice change from traditional floss, however I feel that normal floss is much better and easier to ensure a thorough clean / flossing.  I think I may have misunderstood the purpose of these.  These are great for post-dinner picking of the teeth, but not really for a end of day flossing.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Just good old floss picks. Ordered these with a bunch of other odds and ends to keep from having to go run a bunch of errands.</li>
    <li> Decent flossers, but the floss often times broke or frayed. The &#x27;pick end is not strong and is too thick to fit between teeth. Spend the extra dollar or two and get the higher quality Glide flossers from Oral-B.</li>
    <li> I think there are several similar products on the market. I&#x27;ll only get this when it&#x27;s on sale because it&#x27;s double from others.</li>
    <li> Good floss picks. They haven&#x27;t broken easily like other picks have and they have the thread-like floss that is good for scrubbing against teeth while flossing. I really like them :)</li>
    <li> Buy these and you will floss more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your dentist will love you, and so will your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes flossing easy and their strong too!</li>
    <li> The string stays nice an tight, unlike some other brands that loosen up after the first tooth. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad and he loves them. It reaches within teeth easily and is sturdy so it won&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> I had a big bag of Dentek floss picks just like these that took me a long while to go through, when it was time to re-order I figured I&#x27;d give the Oral-B&#x27;s a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Dentek&#x27;s it was commonplace for me to need to go through 3-4 of them per flossing, the floss itself would frequently either become very loose, or it would simply come out of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Oral-B&#x27;s it&#x27;s normal for me to do a full cleaning with 1 floss pick and have it still be intact. There are times I&#x27;ll have to use 2 of them, but more often than not one of them does the trick. I also find that these do a generally better job than the Dentek&#x27;s I had used previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find these much more convenient than traditional floss, what with having to wrap it up on your fingers &#x27;n such. These are hassle-free</li>
    <li> Now that I tried &amp;#34;Oral-B Glide 3d White Floss Picks Radiant Mint 75 Count Package&amp;#34;, I can appreciate how good these were. Unlike the other one, these don&#x27;t come apart easily.</li>
    <li> I love these. Much easier to use than floss on a roll. They do their job and do it well. Mint is present, but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> These come in a small enough pouch that I carry the thing around with me.  I don&#x27;t always remember to floss at night, but any time I need to fetch something from my bag, I see the floss picks and just do it then.  Hopefully this&#x27;ll help with cavities!</li>
    <li> Great produce as soon as I received it I used it. Then I bleed but that felt great (if your emo this is great) because it makes your teeth feel grreeeaatt.</li>
    <li> These floss picks work very well. The floss and the pick are both durable and get to where you need them to. I like the little bit of mint on the floss which helps keep your mouth a little fresher.</li>
    <li> After having used conventional dental floss string and tape, these picks have surpassed them both.  The string has yet to break and the plastic pick on the end is so much better than any toothpick could ever be.  I feel that they do a much better job of flossing  the teeth and gums.  Don&#x27;t know why my dentist has never recommended them, but I certainly do!</li>
    <li> Nice picks, thin string but strong.  I have very tight teeth and these work really well.  The cheap knockoffs in the stores just don&#x27;t compare.  Would look for these even if a bit overpriced.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent but if you have some hard to get places, the floss get frayed easily.  It&#x27;s not really strong but does the job. Great price.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as advertised. Amazon&#x27;s add-on program makes the price competitive with brick and mortar retailers. You can save yourself a trip.</li>
    <li> Picked these up very cheap - would pay more as they are easy to use and a great way to floss compared to regular dental floss.</li>
    <li> Only reason I bought this was to get the subsrcibe and save discount in one month to hit my max 20% discount and it was pretty cheap. I much prefer just using my Glide floss which works better due to my very narrow gaps between my teeth.</li>
    <li> They are very cheap, a good item to tack on to the cart when you are trying to bridge those last few dollars to get free shipping (thats why I got them anyway). Even though I didn&#x27;t really get them other than for that reason I still have to say these things are really nice and make flossing way easier and have me flossing much more often than I had been prior to having them.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brand that promise no shredding this is the first one that has lived up to its claims I have a few &amp;#34;tight teeth&amp;#34; and these really do the trick with out breaking. I like the slight mint flavor as well it helps make it more pleasant.</li>
    <li> I always use floss picks. usually get the cheap ones from the dollar store. I decided to get these because of the count and I trust the name</li>
    <li> I love this but I can&#x27;t taste the Mint.  They are nice and thin and so can easily be seen while flossing.  I have found that I am a much more regular flosser with these around.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different floss picks. These are the best I have used. They hold up well, and leave my teeth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> These floss picks may get the job done, but are far from comfortable. The floss is waxed, but very thin and seemed to be much harder on my gums than other brands. Additionally, these lack the little ridge that other models have which enables you to use the picks as a tongue scraper. Seems like a little thing, but greatly missed!</li>
    <li> The strings of the floss are really strong and somewhat elastic, I love them. I see myself getting more of it soon. Also looked the minty flavor, though not sure I would mind if it didn&#x27;t have it.</li>
    <li> I love these this is the best fast way to floss and I love the mint flavor on them, I find this a easy way to try and get my kids to floss, don&#x27;t get me wrong its not a miracle to get them to floss, but it helps!!!!</li>
    <li> I love these things, they make flossing easy.  This, in turn, makes it more likely to happen, which is a good thing.  With regular dental floss, I have to use both hands and it&#x27;s a pain.  With this, you have a hand free to move your lip or whatever to see better what you&#x27;re doing. When you&#x27;re done, just throw away.</li>
    <li> These little picks are a great help--much better than using dental floss.  Of  course, the picks have a handle, and that makes it much easier than trying to get so many fingers in my mouth at the same time.  (I&#x27;ve been told I&#x27;ve got a &#x27;big mouth,&#x27; but it isn&#x27;t THAT big!  These are very convenient for me.</li>
    <li> Not sure of what more to say about these, really.  They are good at what they&#x27;re meant for.  These are great for when on vacation or at work during lunch.  Any time you can&#x27;t really break away for a full regiment.</li>
    <li> I keep these in my desk at work for after lunch, they&#x27;ve got a mint flavor to them and are good quality.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These floss picks are cheap and work perfectly. Some picks are too thick for my teeth and hurt. These are very thin and work perfectly. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that makes flossing easy and fun. These are great and I use them after every single meal.</li>
    <li> this item blows away flossing.  It is easier to use...and has a pick on the end so if you need somethign like that to help with your teeth after eating this is the way to go.  Also if you cannot floss because you are out in public this is easily concealed.</li>
    <li> ease of use&lt;br /&gt;use and throw&lt;br /&gt;soft threadds&lt;br /&gt;doesnt damage gums..easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;economic&lt;br /&gt;good count and packaging overall satisfied</li>
    <li> My favorite.  Specially becaus, it&#x27;s upe fast and no more pain on my sensitive infer tips.  No more touching dirty part of the floss.</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppose to do.One of those things you always forget to buy. This brand is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t break when you apply pressure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time using these thingies so I can&#x27;t really compare them to rival products, but I sure am loving them! These make flossing so much easier and faster, and they don&#x27;t break easily (I only need one to clean all my teeth).The price is great for the quality you get, in my opinion. The thickness of the thread is just right for me and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums. Very happy with this product :)</li>
    <li> I keep these at work and they allow me to floss between meals and snacks.&lt;br /&gt;simple, cheap and minty! yay!</li>
    <li> we would floss for your 2 kids every night.  now...my 4yr old flosses by herself.  great product for the price, and if u r prime...just order when you r on the last one.</li>
    <li> I love these floss picks WAY more than the cheap ones that I&#x27;ve purchased from Walgreens in the past.  As someone that doesn&#x27;t floss regularly, keeping these in my car and office gets me to floss when I think about it, not just when I&#x27;m at home...</li>
    <li> Good product, easy to use, changed my habbit to fross my teeth and keep the dental hygienist happy, 90 pieces in a bag is a bit too much, it will be better to be packed in 50 pieces.</li>
    <li> Stash them places that you sit for long periods of time.  I put a pack in my desk at home, desk at work, in my car, and in the remote drawer at home.  Good reminders to floss regularly.</li>
    <li> very low quality too thin</li>
    <li> These floss picks are quite thick. Would work well for kids or people who don&#x27;t have tight teeth. Ended up using these on my 22 month old as they are too wide for the spaces between my teeth.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time to floss my teeth. They work great and hassle free. I never flossed really until I found these.</li>
    <li> what can you say? They either work or they don&#x27;t..These are priced well, they don&#x27;t break easily. All in all, I was happy with them</li>
    <li> Love these and I can&#x27;t find them in any local stores!</li>
    <li> Much easier to use than regular floss. Can reach molars in back of mouth much easier as well. Happy customer :)</li>
    <li> I was a poor floss user till these came out.  Just lazy I guess, but deep thanks to whoever invented this handy disposable little device.</li>
    <li> the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve done for myself. I put these in the door of my car and floss in traffic. They say you should only floss the teeth you want to keep...</li>
    <li> I use these often. They are easier than regular flossing.</li>
    <li> These floss picks work great! The floss string doesn&#x27;t break and it allows you to get to some of the harder to reach molars in the back of our mouth. These are very easy to use. I used the regular floss before and once I tried these, I don&#x27;t think I will go back to the regular one. I do not see any difference in the quality and these are shred resistant.</li>
    <li> Ok, so the headline is overstated.  There&#x27;s not much to comment about here.  The simple devices do exactly as they&#x27;re supposed to.  I have no complaints.  They&#x27;re not as rigid as another brand I used, but that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
    <li> These get stuck in my teeth and hurt. Get the glide ones that are smoother. They are better and about the same price.</li>
    <li> Before getting the Oral-B Complete Floss Picks, I had been using the Dentek Comfort Clean Floss Picks which are advertised as being good for tight teeth and sensitive gum. The Dentek Comfort Clean Floss Picks have wider floss that were like ribbons. I liked the Dentek floss picks a lot, but I saw the the Oral-B Complete Floss Picks are much cheaper and offers the subscription option. The floss on this Oral-B picks are thin floss, so I was a little hesitant about buying them even though it is advertised as &amp;#34;slides easily&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;deep cleans tight teeth.&amp;#34; After trying them, I like them just as much as the Dentek brand and it really does slide easily and clean tight teeth well.</li>
    <li> The string in the last pics I bought would break after a few teeth or at least loosen up.  These pics never do either and after a few weeks of using them, I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
    <li> I like using these instead or regular floss. Its easy to use and have a nice minty flavor. You can reach those molars to floss so much better. Added bonus are those pick ends.</li>
    <li> These Floss picks felt too flimsy and would break easily. Once I had to use three picks to floss my teeth because they kept breaking. They also hurt because the string was too tight on the pick. I&#x27;m a fan of the picks over the roll of floss just makes getting the job done a little easier for me, but these make the job tough.</li>
    <li> I had previously used a generic brand of floss picks and it would take 3 picks because the floss would break. The Oral-B floss picks have a better quality floss, and it only takes one. So a bag of 90 lasts 3 months instead of just 1 month! Plus I find the floss picks easier to use than regular string floss, so I&#x27;m much more likely to floss using these picks. And a lovely minty flavor leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Love these!  I keep them in the car and in my purse.  They come in handy when I am out and about and can&#x27;t pull out a long string of floss.</li>
    <li> Cheap and Effective. I prefer these to regular floss and they are stronger than the Denteks and other similar brands. With Denteks, the floss rips out of the pick before I can even finish one quarter of my mouth. I can floss my entire mouth with these, which makes them even cheaper to use since I&#x27;m using far fewer everyday!</li>
    <li> Best floss picks EVER. Do not buy the dark blue Oral-B whitening picks as I did using the logic that because they&#x27;re more expensive they must be better. I didn&#x27;t even finish using the bag and went straight back to these. Plackers, Dentek, even other Oral-B products, there&#x27;s nothing better.</li>
    <li> These are not shred resistant at all. Every single one of them started to shred after the first tooth. I expect this to happen- I&#x27;m just confused as to why the company calls them shred resistant. They are average floss picks, still usable.</li>
    <li> These picks are great - very little tearing or fraying unlike the ones I previously used. Cheap also, I stocked up on 4 bags.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I purchased these online.  I use them all the time and carry some with me always.  They are great to have with you if you have a snack in between meals.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these! It is so easy to floss now I will never use anything else. I can easily get to my back teeth and if you keep rinsing/cleaning it off as you go I can do my whole mouth with just one! So yes they are sturdy as well :)</li>
    <li> I was extremely pleased with the product, its arrival, and everything!  I use these and will def be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> Received the ordered product, Oral-B Floss Picks, without any fuss. This product worked well with me and easy to use. The service from Amazon was excellent.</li>
    <li> It does what it should.  They are very minty so right after eating is a bit of a shock but they certainly work.</li>
    <li> Really thin (as it is engineered for narrowly placed teeth), yet not flimsy. There are sturdier options that are thicker, which you&#x27;d most likely  prefer if you have widely spaced teeth.</li>
    <li> These floss pics are wonderful.  No need for wrapping long strings of floss around your fingers and having to put your fingers in your mouth.  They are also very sturdy.  I have tight teeth and have never had one shred or break.  I always keep some in my purse.</li>
    <li> I liked it as the strings are strong and mint flavored. I got this pack for a dollar plus from Amazon subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> The floss is too thick. I&#x27;m a regular flosser and found that the floss itself was too thick and the &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; portion was really flimsy.</li>
    <li> Product is ok. Wish is were stronger as it will sometimes break. Not as good as the better floss brands.</li>
    <li> My dentist has been on my to floss, and I just never seem to find the time or desire to whip out old fashioned floss and do it. But with these picks, I can toss one in while I&#x27;m at work, at home, even driving, and I get in and around my teeth much more easily. And at a cost of a couple pennies per pick, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I have had them about a month and went from flossing a couple times every 6 months (unless I got something stuck between my teeth) to flossing 5 times per week or so. My dentist will be happy.</li>
    <li> I have a great feeling when i use it and it is clean and comfortable compared to regula r one.</li>
    <li> These are just like any of floss picks. No problems with them and they are priced fairly. I Would recommend</li>
    <li> These are very easy to use. I used the regular floss before and once I tried these, I don&#x27;t think I will go back to the regular one. I do not see any difference in the quality and these are shred resistant.</li>
    <li> Does its job but I would rather buy oral b glide floss picks. Seems to be much easier to floss with the bigger flat floss than this one..</li>
    <li> Sometimes floss pics can be painful, but this variety is very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t pack a punch.  It works great for cleaning the teeth.  what more can I say?</li>
    <li> These picks are great. They hold up and are great to keep in my lunch bag and center console of the car for after eating.</li>
    <li> I mean really, who actually does floss? Well I do, now. If these things got me to floss, then they were money well spent. Expect to bleed a lot at first if you&#x27;re just getting back to flossing, but your gums will strengthen up.</li>
    <li> These really are the only way I remember to floss. I have a bag stored in my desk drawer at work and keep them in the bathroom.  Otherwise I just will never be motivated to stick my hands in my mouth to floss- gross.  These are much cleaner and easier.</li>
    <li> Love these picks. Fit well between tight places and regular. I hope they come back to subscribe and save as this was the best price and automatic delivery is great. These pics don&#x27;t get &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; between teeth like some others we have tried.</li>
    <li> I can now floss my teeth without having to wrap sticky floss around my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(These things are pretty self-explanatory with a basic function. I find them to work quite well for my needs)</li>
    <li> If it weren&#x27;t for these picks then I probably wouldn&#x27;t floss as much as I should. Since getting these I floss everyday. They&#x27;re east to use and it&#x27;s so much easier than dealing with flossing the traditional way.</li>
    <li> The floss doesn&#x27;t break as easy as most of the other flossers I used. Also the back &amp;#34;toothpick&amp;#34; side is not too large and still fits between my teeth. The mint is just a plus as I like the way it feels after using them. I use one after lunch and dinner.</li>
    <li> These floss picks are easy to use and one pack contains a great amount.  However, they are not as comfortable to use as some other pics.  The floss on this particular brand is very thick.  I ended up switching back to regular floss until another brand comes in.</li>
    <li> This particular floss pic is a good fit and strong enough to get the job done. It is the best one that I have used.</li>
    <li> These were a little cheaper and didn&#x27;t work in my tight teeth as other floss stick have in the past...... more flossy and less glide ribbon</li>
    <li> its really flimsy. you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have used a ton of floss picks and most break in the process. These are an exception to that rule. When they call these “shred resistant”, they are not joking. They resist shredding and breaking better than anything else I have ever used. At the same time, they are easy to use as whatever coating is on them allows them to move easily in between teeth. This makes flossing much more practical and easy to do even when on the go. These particular Oral-B picks are a must-have!</li>
    <li> Buen producto y buena compra  la que se hace aqui recome ndado se guro, , , , , , ,</li>
    <li> After quite some time not taking care of my dental hygiene, my tooth started to show signs of decay: cavities and several root canals (Very Painful). My dentist advise to brush often and floss on after every meal. I bought these to try them out and they works like a charm. The thread and handle is stable enough for flossing in all areas of the mouth and does not causes &amp;#34;Gaps in the teeth&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Honestly I can&#x27;t complain that much because of the price and free shipping, but these are pretty bad. I thought the negative reviews were just crazy people, but I guess they were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to brands that I purchase at my local target, these are garbage. The toothpick end is just the wrong shape/thickness and seems to be about 25% as effective as the ones purchased in store. Can&#x27;t really complain about the floss end though, it does its job, so 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I like this floss a lot. Its very easy to use this floss and cleans better. Also, it doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. The string on these dont break as they do on the cheaper ones. Also, the mint is a nice touch. Would recommend is the price is right</li>
    <li> These floss picks work great! The floss string doesn&#x27;t break and it allows you to get to some of the harder to reach molars in the back of our mouth.  normal floss would always break or just be hard to use to get way down toward the gums for some of the rear teeth, but these picks allow you to keep your hands out of your mouth to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind paying a bit higher price for the ease of use and convenience of these things.  My teeth feel clean and look great.</li>
    <li> Does as it says. What more can you ask for.&lt;br /&gt;Great investment in your teeth that you won&#x27;t regret.&lt;br /&gt;Floss away!</li>
    <li> good product, good price - can&#x27;t go wrong! happy with my purchase and would recommend &#x3D; nice add on item</li>
    <li> Floss sucks!  What a pain!  But these little jewels make flossing a breeze!  Don&#x27;t waste time and effort with floss, these are easier in every way!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t collapse or fall apart like the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  It is reliable and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> its nice but i dont think i will buy this product on amazon again.  i prefer to use the pick floss with 2 lines of floss.  it seems stronger and works better.  also this product is not that cheap on amazon.  i can find it cheaper at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as comfortable as floss can be and gets the stuff between my teeth out.  The mint flavor doesn&#x27;t last long but what little of it there is doesn&#x27;t taste bad.  It&#x27;s not really on my top list of priorities when buying floss so I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
    <li> This product definitely makes it easier to floss, particularly for the back teeth. I always have a hard time getting regular flossing thread there - with this you can just bite down on the product and it will slide right into the place where you want to have it. Then just use the handle to move it back and forth to clean the interstice. I also enjoy the minty flavor. You get a lot of picks and they are sturdy - I had no problem with them breaking during use. If you happen to have sharp tooth edges, that may tear portions of the band, but it will still not break it, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;The product also arrived much sooner than predicted. I did not have to wait for 4 weeks, it came in just like a regular Amazon order. I would repurchase this product and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Threat is to thin and sharp. It cuts my gums sometimes and it does not feel like they clean/remove the stuff in between the teeth.</li>
    <li> Good floss picks. They haven&#x27;t broken easily like other picks have and they have the thread-like floss that is good for scrubbing against teeth while flossing. I really like them :)</li>
    <li> I have tried several varieties of floss picks, and they all tend to break too easily. These are sturdy and get the job done. I can&#x27;t see myself ever using any other flossers again.</li>
    <li> No more sticking your hands in your mouth. Used these and never had the floss break even with having to bite down on the pick to get the floss between my teeth. I would recommend these to anyone needing a good floss. It is addictive and I even find myself massaging my gums while at work after lunch and while watching TV.</li>
    <li> The floss is strong and the pick is sharp. It gets the job done! The pick is good for adults and may not be good for kids with small mouth.</li>
