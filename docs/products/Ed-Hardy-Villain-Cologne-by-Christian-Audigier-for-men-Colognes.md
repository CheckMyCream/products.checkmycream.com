      <li>Love this smell.  </li>
      <li>Love this a lot.  </li>
      <li>(Another Ed Hardy cologne and one of my favorite)</li>
      <li>I liked it because it was a clean smell.....</li>
      <li>I smelled it at the store and figured it smelled pretty good</li>
      <li>I recommend a sample first as it does not smell good on all skin types.</li>
      <li>Smelled Pretty Good To Me.</li>
      <li>A+ Got my favorite cologne at a great low price!</li>
      <li>Shipping box was fine</li>
      <li>The bottle is huge and it&#x27;s just the smell I was expecting.</li>
      <li>It is light and seductive for all occasions.</li>
      <li>I ordered this with another Ed Hardy cologne, fantastic price, not an imposter, and delivered overnight .&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I saw that they had this cologne here for 40 bucks cheaper with free shipping, I thought why not?</li>
      <li>Ed Hardy products for men are worth buying and seem to have a better price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>When I found out that they didn&#x27;t have the original cologne I wanted there, I figure I&#x27;d search around here to find it.</li>
      <li>I dont really think its all that great alone but mixed with Love &amp; Luck</li>
      <li>The scent is unique.</li>
      <li>so I was very excited to find a bottle this large for so cheap.</li>
      <li>Packaged well, arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I bought the male and female versions of this brand because they both smell awesome.</li>
      <li>super price for a name brand product.</li>
      <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;Big bottle and cheap price&lt;br /&gt;Smell last most of the day</li>
      <li>I think the scent is better, is more consistent, and lasts just as long.  </li>
      <li>And for the price, it was completely worth it.</li>
      <li>you like Ed Hardy, and are looking for something more mature</li>
      <li>I Own The Female Version Of This Scent</li>
      <li>I tried it for the first time and  I enjoyed the new Sense of the cologne.</li>
      <li>will be ordering more as gifts to other for sure.</li>
      <li>It also came in a very large quantity.  </li>
      <li>I first smelled this product at a Macy&#x27;s for a quick second and pleasantly enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>Nice but not as unique as the Love and Daggers and the other one with similar bottle design.  </li>
      <li>sometimes the samples smell better than the full bottles for some strange reason.</li>
      <li>Its comes in a fun tin can and has a plastic thing on the top of the actual bottle.</li>
      <li>The smell is great and it last for a long time.  </li>
      <li>When I wore it for the first time I noticed it has mellow sweetness to it.</li>
      <li>Thanks Timex!</li>
      <li>The top notes when it first go on smell like orange blossom (which smells just like Fruit Loops), and they are very present.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s  long lasting and the price was great.</li>
      <li>Can keep the date straight now!  </li>
      <li>exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>if you didn&#x27;t use too much!</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t like this the first time I smelled it in the mall, but I bought a travel pack of three different Ed Hardy colonges and this smell alot better after you have it</li>
      <li>Fruity and sweet but masculine.</li>
      <li>I recommend it for any one who wants to save on a premium item</li>
      <li>The product came as described and seems to be the real deal.  </li>
      <li>spray too much it is concentrated.</li>
      <li>This was the real thing.  </li>
      <li>Ed Hardy has several nice smelling colonges that are relatively inexspensive</li>
      <li>while in no way the price is comparable to Pacco Rabanne&#x27;s One Million (love that immensely) to me this fragrance has that equally distinguishable level of sophistication and charm.</li>
      <li>It smells super sugary and musky at the same time, and the smell makes me nauseous.</li>
      <li>Very Classy!  </li>
      <li>Comes Out Hard, But Softens Down With A Nice, Sweet, Mellow Smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend for the young and the old.</li>
      <li>Young man&#x27;s scent, like Fruit Loops young.  </li>

    <li> smells like the sample I had and was a great price when I bought it. sometimes the samples smell better than the full bottles for some strange reason.</li>
    <li> The product came as described and seems to be the real deal.  The cologne smells okay, but would choose love and luck over this one. I would buy from seller again.</li>
    <li> I Own The Female Version Of This Scent So I Purchased As A Gift For Dad or Boyfriend. Not Sure Which One Im Going To Give It To Yet But I Smelled It Before Wrapping &amp; It Smelled Pretty Good To Me. Can&#x27;t Argue With The Price For The Size Of The Bottle!</li>
    <li> the container was severely banged up when it was received.  Shipping box was fine so it must have been sent this way.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves how it smells and so do I. It&#x27;s  long lasting and the price was great.</li>
    <li> Received in a timely fashion great product</li>
    <li> Came in time and is one of my favorites :)</li>
    <li> Ed Hardy has several nice smelling colonges that are relatively inexspensive and this is another one.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like this the first time I smelled it in the mall, but I bought a travel pack of three different Ed Hardy colonges and this smell alot better after you have it on.&lt;br /&gt;Big bottle and cheap price&lt;br /&gt;Smell last most of the day</li>
    <li> Great scent great price. Rip Christian Audigier.</li>
    <li> Great smell,mild. Only thing it wont last long on you.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband he loves it the smell is soo good</li>
    <li> This was the real thing.  I got this cheaper than I would have if I bought at a department store.</li>
    <li> Good price and smells great</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised. excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I liked it because it was a clean smell.....if you didn&#x27;t use too much! It isn&#x27;t a memorable aroma, but it will do.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes and besides the amazing smell, the price is unbeatable. I give this product 5 stars based on not only its quality but the insanely low price. Buy it, you will not be disappointed, I promise!</li>
    <li> Good clean scent. Fruity and sweet but masculine. Would recommend to others. I had seen this cologne for sale before for about 30 dollars so I was very excited to find a bottle this large for so cheap. I ordered and received it in about a week</li>
    <li> I bought the male and female versions of this brand because they both smell awesome. I actually combine them together for a unisex fragrance I call &amp;#34;Super Villain.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a quality product that smells great ! Ed Hardy products for men are worth buying and seem to have a better price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cologne.  The smell is great and it last for a long time.  My grandson smelled it and now I will have to get him a bottle.</li>
    <li> bought 3 of these already... because other&#x27;s were impressed with the awesome scent.. while in no way the price is comparable to Pacco Rabanne&#x27;s One Million (love that immensely) to me this fragrance has that equally distinguishable level of sophistication and charm. love it love it love it... would unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone. will be ordering more as gifts to other for sure.</li>
    <li> super price for a name brand product. I recommend it for any one who wants to save on a premium item</li>
    <li> Found this product for $30 less than Walmart. Great price! Walmart advertised the 1 oz for $25.00ish and found this one for the same price but for a 4.6 oz bottle! You cannot beat that! My Husband loved it and he smells delicious! &gt;:]  A++++</li>
    <li> Always great service and the real genuine product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on this scent! I recommend a sample first as it does not smell good on all skin types.</li>
    <li> i only bought this because i was desperate for cologne since i was running low on my normal supply. I decided to risk buying Villain by Ed Hardy off of amazon. Its comes in a fun tin can and has a plastic thing on the top of the actual bottle. This smells ok by itself. I dont really think its all that great alone but mixed with Love &amp; Luck (Another Ed Hardy cologne and one of my favorite) it smells great! I got many compliments mixing the two colognes together. This cologne by itself smells sort of like cookies. buy it if you want and it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Young man&#x27;s scent, like Fruit Loops young.  The top notes when it first go on smell like orange blossom (which smells just like Fruit Loops), and they are very present.  And it lasts for a while, so the citrus top notes stick with you for a while.  If you last through that, the base notes are very nice left behind, sandalwood and cedar come through and stick around for a while.  That&#x27;s where you will get the compliments on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Ed Hardy, and are looking for something more mature, go with Ed Hardy Love and Luck.  I think the scent is better, is more consistent, and lasts just as long.  I have worn both, and get more compliments when I wear Love and Luck.  I would like to try Hearts and Daggars soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad for Christmas and he loves it!!</li>
    <li> I am always getting attention from women saying how well I smell. They like it and so do I.&lt;br /&gt;Great price too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked all the Ed Hardy fragrances I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great,  Getting it for almost half the price was awesome.</li>
    <li> I first smelled this product at a Macy&#x27;s for a quick second and pleasantly enjoyed it. When I found out that they didn&#x27;t have the original cologne I wanted there, I figure I&#x27;d search around here to find it. When I saw that they had this cologne here for 40 bucks cheaper with free shipping, I thought why not? It smells terrible. Maybe it&#x27;s because I only smelled it for a second in store, but now that I&#x27;ve actually smelled it on me, it smells bad. It smells super sugary and musky at the same time, and the smell makes me nauseous. Since I&#x27;ve already used it, I can&#x27;t return it back to Amazon, I&#x27;m stuck with 4.2 ounce of cr*p smelling cologne. DON&#x27;T BUY.</li>
    <li> I Smelled This Cologne In A Department Store. In Macy&#x27;s, It Was $69.99. The Price Was Outrageous! I Knew I Would Find It Here For Half The Price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I Paid $34 For This Cologne. It .. Is .. Beautiful! Comes Out Hard, But Softens Down With A Nice, Sweet, Mellow Smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT for Casual Use! Big Enough For Everyday Use.&lt;br /&gt;Buy It .. You Wont Regret It.</li>
    <li> Nice but not as unique as the Love and Daggers and the other one with similar bottle design.  Good light day fragrance in my opinion..</li>
    <li> Great product smell great and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Dont spray too much it is concentrated.</li>
    <li> Ive been wearing this for a long time now. It smells great for casual affairs but doesn&#x27;t last as long as i would like it to.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves the stuff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many colognes from Amazon. Ed Hardy Villain is in my top 5. The scent is unique. I get so many compliments from others when I wear this. I ordered this with another Ed Hardy cologne, fantastic price, not an imposter, and delivered overnight .&lt;br /&gt;All my friends wear this.</li>
    <li> My wife bought me this cologne for a gift she liked The way it&#x27;s smeled. I tried it for the first time and  I enjoyed the new Sense of the cologne. I would recommend this Cologne to anybody That does not like a overpowering Cologne.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my husband for Christmas. I  hope he like it. Also, I am so happy with how fast I recived my order.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome gift for guys. The cologne smells great and the packaging is fun too. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Fake, it smells like crap... Literally!</li>
    <li> Very Classy!  Love this a lot.  Can keep the date straight now!  Like my T2H381 a lot too!  Thanks Timex!</li>
    <li> Perfect Xmas gift! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne after looking in all of the local stores where I live.  Amazon had this for a fraction of the price... and it smells great. My wife loves when I wear it, so I know I made a good decision.  I have other Ed Hardy colognes... and I know that I cannot go wrong with Ed Hardy.</li>
    <li> The bottle is huge and it&#x27;s just the smell I was expecting. And for the price, it was completely worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local retailer for around the same price. I smelled it at the store and figured it smelled pretty good so I bought it. When I wore it for the first time I noticed it has mellow sweetness to it. Gave it to my sister.</li>
    <li> Great value fast shipping</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, I get a lot of nice feedback on the cologne, fast shipping and a great price.</li>
    <li> A+ Got my favorite cologne at a great low price! Packaged well, arrived quickly. Will definitely use you again!</li>
    <li> Love this smell.  A lot of people compliment me and ask what it is.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a christmas gift and he gets compliments from men and women! It is light and seductive for all occasions. I would buy it again from this seller when he runs out. Ed Hardy is the best cologne for my husband and your man too!</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling fragrance for the price.  It also came in a very large quantity.  I&#x27;d recommend for the young and the old.</li>
