### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>This is the best  !</li>
      <li>I have been using this moisturizer for about two days now and it is perfect.</li>
      <li>Best ever for skin prone to exzema.</li>
      <li>It is a wonderful line.  </li>
      <li>The feel is not greasy, the effect is very good.</li>
      <li>But best of all it is a great skin product.  </li>
      <li>A great product, that has been out of stock, can I buy, I am very happy</li>
      <li>Non-greasy, great feeling.</li>
      <li>Great sun protection/moisturizer for 40+ skin type.</li>
      <li>I have used it for years and it works great and does not break me out.  </li>
      <li>Quality product at a good price</li>
      <li>Good sunscreen that does the job.  </li>
      <li>And that one bottle lasts a good while, because it is taking me forever to finish it</li>
      <li>I had liked the concept of the two in one for convenience and assumed Cetaphil would be good for my skin.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>sure I can indicate to another friends</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t do better than this sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>so I can move on to a better sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I like the SPF 50 in my moisturizer, and the 3-pack seems to be one of the better prices.</li>
      <li>I have used many Cetaphil products for years.  </li>
      <li>The zinc ointment contained in this needs to be rubbed in pretty good.</li>
      <li>This is a great sunblock for sensitive skin that burns easily.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on too tacky and is absorbed by the skin quickly forming a good sunblock.  </li>
      <li>so a strong moisturizer is a must...as is a strong sunblock.</li>
      <li>it soaks in fine.</li>
      <li>Recommended by dermatologists and free samples are in their offices.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much that I buy all Cetaphil products.</li>
      <li>Perfect for everyday, without being too greasy or causing breakouts.</li>
      <li>Works good as a sunscreen for everyday usage for fair skinned people as myself.  </li>
      <li>This is a very good sunscreen and it does not feel heavy or smell too strong.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs moisturizing and a sunscreen and who wants a superior product.</li>
      <li>Safe and reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>The only good thing about this sunscreen is the high SPF.</li>
      <li>I like the higher sunscreen (50)&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
      <li>It does exactly what you don&#x27;t want it to do.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried another sunscreen that is reportedly not as toxic and which also absorbs clear and quickly, without any greasiness or shininess on face.</li>
      <li>like so much this product and was delivery faster</li>
      <li>It makes my face look really shiny in pictures.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Vaseline is better and cost less if you must use this product use olive oil instead of.</li>
      <li>Even though it goes on white it will quickly absorb into the skin.</li>
      <li>It feels super greasy on my skin and needs extra massaging to absorb.</li>
      <li>I was recommended to buy this moisturizer because of the high SPF after a peel.</li>
      <li>Gentle on my sensitive face.</li>
      <li>If you live in the  Zahara desert perhaps but even there the sand might stick to it and become a clay statue.</li>
      <li>I live in Colorado</li>
      <li>know it&#x27;s very soon to be writing a review, but I already see a major difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>So yes, I would highly recommend this if you have sensitive skin for yourself or your kids.</li>
      <li>This is the first moisturizer that actually works on my face.</li>
      <li>My nose normally peels off by the end of the day, but my skin is clear and the flakes are gone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>I really like this to work both as a facial moisturizer and sunblock.  </li>
      <li>good price, difficult to find in a lot of the stores.</li>
      <li>As older skin dries out a slightly heavier moisturizer is needed and this works quite well at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The same product with the orange spf 50 is recommended and I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>but I would rather pay a little more to ensure that they are protected under the sun than have to worry that they are getting reactions on their skin from those other brands.</li>
      <li>The SPF is so high that you are left with a ghostly white face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was recommended to buy this moisturizer because of the high SPF after a peel. This  is the worst product I ever used. If you live in the  Zahara desert perhaps but even there the sand might stick to it and become a clay statue. This is not a moisturizer but engine oil. It looks white when you apply it and then it becomes less noticeable but the worst part of it, it is so greasing, so shiny , you look ridiculous, like you need to wash your face. It does exactly what you don&#x27;t want it to do. The oily look makes everything on your face looks bigger the wrinkles and imperfections because of the reflection from shine. Do not waste your money. Vaseline is better and cost less if you must use this product use olive oil instead of. Another sad thing I bought 3 of this, what a waste of money, I will use it to grease my bikes wheels.</li>
    <li> I like the SPF 50 in my moisturizer, and the 3-pack seems to be one of the better prices.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed.  I use it on my hands but won&#x27;t buy for my face again.&lt;br /&gt;It is very oily and if you perspire sings your eyes badly.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunblock for sensitive skin that burns easily.  It doesn&#x27;t go on too tacky and is absorbed by the skin quickly forming a good sunblock.  It dosen&#x27;t have any scent either.  I really like this to work both as a facial moisturizer and sunblock.  I also use it on my hands and arms.</li>
    <li> Sunscreen and moisturizer in one application.</li>
    <li> This is the only facial moisturizer I use and I love it. I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction as I have with other moisturizers. But I should note that my friend did.</li>
    <li> Not moisturizing enough for me.  Hard to even rub on unless over another moisturizer.  I had liked the concept of the two in one for convenience and assumed Cetaphil would be good for my skin.  I live in Colorado so a strong moisturizer is a must...as is a strong sunblock.</li>
    <li> My kids (5 &amp; 2) both have allergies and also had ezcema when they were babies. I have tried all the other sunscreens meant for sensitive skin but my oldest still had a reaction to them. I use Cetaphil cream daily on the kids to help fight the ezcema so when I found the Cetaphil sunscreen SPF 50+, I knew I needed to try it out. It is probably more expensive than the other sunscreens out there (ie., Banana Boat, Neutrogena, etc...) but I would rather pay a little more to ensure that they are protected under the sun than have to worry that they are getting reactions on their skin from those other brands. I get this product off Subscribe &amp; Save since I use it a lot. That reduces the price. So yes, I would highly recommend this if you have sensitive skin for yourself or your kids. I never go wrong with Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> A great product, that has been out of stock, can I buy, I am very happy oh. The feel is not greasy, the effect is very good.</li>
    <li> My doctor suggested Cetaphil body lotion to me to combat dry, itchy skin. I liked it so much that I buy all Cetaphil products. This one contains a sunscreen, so by using it every morning I know I&#x27;m protecting the skin on my face. This daily facial moisturizer softens my skin, but isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. No perfume either, so no itches. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs moisturizing and a sunscreen and who wants a superior product.</li>
    <li> There are 2 cetephil products that are almost identical.  This product is not recommended by the Skin Cancer Foundation.  The same product with the orange spf 50 is recommended and I highly recommend this product.  Even though it goes on white it will quickly absorb into the skin.</li>
    <li> I was advised by a dermatologist to use this on my face.  I have used it for years and it works great and does not break me out.  I would like to find a physical barrier face sunscreen that would work as well because I don&#x27;t like wearing sunscreen with all the questionable chemicals in these types of sunscreens.  Until they do though I will continue to use this one.</li>
    <li> Best ever for skin prone to exzema.</li>
    <li> Quality product at a good price</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this sunscreen is the high SPF. And that one bottle lasts a good while, because it is taking me forever to finish it so I can move on to a better sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is not good for me. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;- I have a beige complexion, and it leaves a white residue on my face.&lt;br /&gt;- It feels super greasy on my skin and needs extra massaging to absorb. It makes my face look really shiny in pictures.&lt;br /&gt;-It contains oxybenzone (reportedly associated with hormone disruption and possible cell damage)  and parabens, which are reportedly not good for you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried another sunscreen that is reportedly not as toxic and which also absorbs clear and quickly, without any greasiness or shininess on face.</li>
    <li> This is the best  ! Non-greasy, great feeling.</li>
    <li> Great sun protection/moisturizer for 40+ skin type.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have used it for several years.</li>
    <li> I like the higher sunscreen (50)&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is whiter when you apply it,&lt;br /&gt;but it soaks in fine.</li>
    <li> I have used many Cetaphil products for years.  It is a wonderful line.  Safe and reasonably priced.  But best of all it is a great skin product.  You can&#x27;t do better than this sunscreen.  No matter what you pay.</li>
    <li> This product was a bit greasy for my skin. If I put it on at the beginning of the day, by 10 AM I&#x27;m shiny!</li>
    <li> Great! Recommended by dermatologists and free samples are in their offices. When you have been to the dermatologist and been diagnosed with melanoma etc..., you start wearing this a lot. The zinc ointment contained in this needs to be rubbed in pretty good.</li>
    <li> Works good as a sunscreen for everyday usage for fair skinned people as myself.  thank you</li>
    <li> This is a very good sunscreen and it does not feel heavy or smell too strong.</li>
    <li> Perfect for everyday, without being too greasy or causing breakouts.</li>
    <li> This product was indicate for me by a friend.&lt;br /&gt;I like so much this product and was delivery faster&lt;br /&gt;For sure I can indicate to another friends</li>
    <li> Gentle on my sensitive face. As older skin dries out a slightly heavier moisturizer is needed and this works quite well at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> good price, difficult to find in a lot of the stores.</li>
    <li> Good sunscreen that does the job.  Bought it for my husband, but I like it also.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about two days now and it is perfect. I have chronic eczema that covers not only my face but also my hands, arms, legs, and neck. This is the first moisturizer that actually works on my face. My skin doesn&#x27;t soak it up as soon as it&#x27;s put on, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look, and I can&#x27;t feel it. My nose normally peels off by the end of the day, but my skin is clear and the flakes are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s very soon to be writing a review, but I already see a major difference in my skin. For my friends with chronic eczema, like me, you need this product!</li>
    <li> The SPF is so high that you are left with a ghostly white face.</li>
</ol>
