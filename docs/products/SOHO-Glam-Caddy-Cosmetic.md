      <li>I find that I run out of room too quickly with all the stuff you need to put in a cosmetic organizer.</li>
      <li>However the MK caddy&#x27;s handle is rather high and that can can make fitting it into my carry-on or tote problematic.  </li>

      <li>Wish they made a version twice as large.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have recently returned from a three week trip through four countries, and had no problems with simply placing the filled caddy into the bottom of the tote then dropping in the other junk one carries on top.  </li>
      <li>I found that, for example, the &amp;#34;two week supply&amp;#34; size of moisturizer from a Lancome or Lauder GWP lasted slightly over three weeks easily.  </li>
      <li>Love it but expected it to be larger.</li>
      <li>I cracked the old one because I&#x27;d underestimate the weight and bang it on the vanity.</li>
      <li>Of course, the liquid items still had to be limited and in the zip lock bag when flying, but that was only a minor inconvenience, which did not negate the for me major convenience of having my kit ready the second I walked into a new hotel room, as well as no hassle with loading and unloading assorted zipped cosmetic bags.&lt;br /&gt;Bear</li>

    <li> Very nice thick acrylic.  Wish they made a version twice as large.  I use it for my makeup and tuck it on the shelf under my sink.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a young woman and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Love it, just wished the thing was larger -  I find that I run out of room too quickly with all the stuff you need to put in a cosmetic organizer.</li>
    <li> It is great. Just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Nice size compartments for my &amp;#34; extra&amp;#34; occasional wear make up. I can store it in the linen closet, grab the handy handle, there it is, all in one place easy to see and reach for.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I use it for my nail polish tools, remover, cuticle oils and various other nail stuff. It is well made and meets my needs quite well. The dimension were correct and I would not hesitate to buy this again or recommend it.</li>
    <li> I did not give five stars simply because I would have made some slight variations in the configuration of the spaces.  Otherwise it is exactly what I needed, which was a sturdy acrylic caddy to carry my cosmetics in when traveling.  I have had the old Mary Kay caddy for at least 15 years, it has compartments from very small squares to one long one the length of the entire caddy.  However the MK caddy&#x27;s handle is rather high and that can can make fitting it into my carry-on or tote problematic.  I have recently returned from a three week trip through four countries, and had no problems with simply placing the filled caddy into the bottom of the tote then dropping in the other junk one carries on top.  Of course, the liquid items still had to be limited and in the zip lock bag when flying, but that was only a minor inconvenience, which did not negate the for me major convenience of having my kit ready the second I walked into a new hotel room, as well as no hassle with loading and unloading assorted zipped cosmetic bags.&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind you still should be using little sample size containers.  Not a problem.  I found that, for example, the &amp;#34;two week supply&amp;#34; size of moisturizer from a Lancome or Lauder GWP lasted slightly over three weeks easily.  FWIW.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cosmetics or any small items that you move from shelf to work area. Heavy duty. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect size to sit on top of my toilet in my tiny bathroom, and can carry to my desk if I want to sit to apply makeup.  Holds my moisturizer, astringent, eye cream and all makeup.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great little organizer. It holds everything I need neatly and nicely</li>
    <li> Lightweight and easy to lift. I had another acrylic caddy that was very nice but almost too heavy, and when it was filled it was too much. I cracked the old one because I&#x27;d underestimate the weight and bang it on the vanity. I culled my cosmetics and got this lighter caddy and I&#x27;m super happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer.  It keeps everything separated and organized and I no longer have to dig in order to find what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> Love it but expected it to be larger.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer. I&#x27;m able to move my make up from my vanity to anywhere I may need to use it with ease. Its thick, sturdy and very chic. I&#x27;m definitely ordering a second one</li>
    <li> Purchased two of these for gifts. Both ladies indicated that they were perfect to keep and carry their makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made piece of acrylic, it holds all of my daily makeup and more.  The over all size is perfect, it easily slides in and out of my bathroom cabinet drawers, enabling me to quickly take out everything I need to do my makeup and simple to put away keeping the counter top clean and neat.</li>
    <li> Does what I want. Using for nail polish, polish remover etc. Easy to take with me to anywhere in the house.</li>
    <li> This is just perfect for my daily makeup selection. I grab it out of the closet, everything is in one place and I pop it back in. No more digging through little makeup bags looking for small pencils and brushes.</li>
    <li> Heavy. Look at the width of the dividers and the handle. They are thick. It also seems larger than in the photos. They should have shot it with a dark background so you can see what a substantial piece of acrylic it is. The handle is key so it can be easily picked up or leave it on your vanity it looks great as is. It looks like it could take a drop onto a tile or hard wood floor with no problem.</li>
    <li> This works well for moving my cosmetics around the house. I wanted one with taller sides since I&#x27;m also usually carting around taller items (hair spray, astringent, etc.). I didn&#x27;t see one I liked so I bought this. Taller sides would have earned this five stars.</li>
