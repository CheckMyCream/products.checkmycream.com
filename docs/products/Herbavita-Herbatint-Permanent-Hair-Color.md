      <li>Wonderful and natural hair color</li>

      <li>Herbatint has so many colors to pick from too.</li>
      <li>Love this hair color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Herbatint since 2005, when I could no longer afford visits to my favorite salon every 6 weeks.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>This product is one of the most damaging dyes on my hair that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad to use something without chemicals.</li>
      <li>Love Herbatint products and</li>
      <li>Very gentle and very safe.  </li>
      <li>I like the fact that it has no harsh chemicals, which is great for your hair.  </li>
      <li>Easy to color your hair at home.</li>
      <li>With the chemical hair colors, the  color would fade very quickly from shampooing and sun exposure.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>I do have fine hair</li>
      <li>So this is actually light brown.  </li>
      <li>I had roots growing out from summer and extremely light hair.</li>
      <li>Near from the good work</li>
      <li>Gives me a rich color that lasts much longer !!!  </li>
      <li>I should mention that I am generally allergic to most colorants, but find this an excellent alternative to the more common brands you see in stores.</li>
      <li>For others it is probably a good alternative to regular hair color though.</li>
      <li>I was a professional hair colorist and am extremely experienced in professional color lines.  </li>
      <li>Received it quickly and as promised.</li>
      <li>and it made my hair actually shiny and silky smooth!!  </li>
      <li>This was fantastic came straight to my house.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found a more natural hair color.  </li>
      <li>Nice product covers well and allows one to save any unused product for future use.</li>
      <li>Haircolor itself is really nice,  does not leave lots of red tones.</li>
      <li>I use the combination of 5N &amp; 6N to get the right shade for me.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle on the hair and true to colors.</li>
      <li>It covers the gray nicely and lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, wavy hair, and everyone&#x27;s hair won&#x27;t necessarily react like mine, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
      <li>and I was a little worried, but after a couple of washings it has lightened up and actually stayed the perfect color.  </li>
      <li>I feel better not having to breathe in the fumes of other boxed color, even if they are ammonia free.</li>
      <li>BUT, several months after beginning use, I noticed my hairline receding and thinning on the top of my scalp.  </li>
      <li>And doesn&#x27;t contain most harmful chemicals that traditional dyes do.  </li>
      <li>Not really a complaint, simply a warning that one needs to try a few colors before finding the perfect match</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s perfect... not so dark that I have to worry about new grey growth announcing itself quite so soon.</li>
      <li>Without the possible hair loss, I would easily give Herbatint 5 stars.</li>
      <li>(luckily, I had an old tinting brush that came with a hair color</li>
      <li>, use the &#x27;natural&#x27; line, not the &#x27;ash&#x27; or &#x27;golden&#x27; shades.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 5 years and it works great for me.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ve tried henna, which was very permanent but always came redder than what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping, all you could want from a hair paint</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling as healthy like the other one does, so I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.  </li>
      <li>For example, the Dark Blonde 6N that I used perfectly matched my relatively dark brunet hair.</li>
      <li>The color turned out OK and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad when using it so that was good.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s zero odor afterward, and my hair acts pretty happy, at least for the first few weeks.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t be fooled by the natural name and package design -- this haircolor certainly has chemicals, but in my case, the chemicals were non-irritating.  </li>
      <li>The color is very dark at first, but after a couple weeks fades to what I would call a light brown color.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;dark blonde\\&quot; is really medium brown and the \\&quot;light chestnut\\</li>
      <li>The health food store in my town sells this, it doesn&#x27;t normally carry the color I use, so every time I get it</li>
      <li>I have continued to use it, trying to apply to my hairline last, and wash off right at 30 min.  </li>
      <li>Overall, the effect is nice, creating a more consistent look which I would describe as a very dark brown with subtle strawberry-blonde undertones and highlights.  </li>
      <li>It does leave your hair incredibly dry, so you&#x27;ll need an excellent conditioner after washing out the dye (the provided conditioner only covers really short hair), but that is no different than other permanent hair colorants.  </li>
      <li>It is totally odorless and feels very gentle to the hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m spoiled by the other organic, naturtint hair coloring, but I hadn&#x27;t tried this one and wanted to see if it was as good because it&#x27;s a little cheaper.  </li>
      <li>The product is easy to use (you only have to mix two provided bottles before applying), and doesn&#x27;t take long (45 minutes to set).  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled - this permanent color changed my gray to a light brown with a little strawberry undertone.  </li>
      <li>Try it out, better yet call the company to speak with the master colorist if you&#x27;re having a hard time deciding what to do.</li>
      <li>Not ALL NATURAL.</li>
      <li>I was alarmed, so called customer service, where they only have one woman available to answer questions, and she told me the reason this happens is because the hair follicle is left open after coloring!</li>
      <li>I used the old ice cream container) and also there is no applicator</li>
      <li>Covers grey very well!</li>
      <li>No harsh chemicals.  </li>
      <li>It is not possible to wash my hair unless I use a heavy conditioner now, just to get it somewhat soft and able to run a comb through it.</li>
      <li>I thought I was a light brown, but the product that looked closest to my natural hair color was Dark Blonde</li>
      <li>It took me three tries before I read the fine print that says if you need grey coverage (because why else would I be doing this?!)</li>
      <li>I brought this to my hairdresser, who applied it only to my roots, and the color blended well with my previous Natural Instincts light brown.  </li>
      <li>No other natural hair color that I have used has ever done this, so I had no idea this one would.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Have used Herbatint for many years. It is gentle on the hair and true to colors. Easy to color your hair at home.</li>
    <li> Long-lasting color.  Easy to apply.  Not ALL NATURAL.</li>
    <li> A great hair color that uses plant based ingredients instead of chemicals you cannot pronounce. I feel better not having to breathe in the fumes of other boxed color, even if they are ammonia free. Herbatint has so many colors to pick from too. I mix in a little Ash blonde to this one to reduce the red effect I always get. A lot of women get that same dreaded red color from blonde hair color, why this still does that to my hair it is not as red as toxic color. Try it out, better yet call the company to speak with the master colorist if you&#x27;re having a hard time deciding what to do.</li>
    <li> Love Herbatint products and this did not disappoint.  A bit darker than I expected but like it.  Received it quickly and as promised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to call it dark blond. I should&#x27;ve trusted the picture. Smells bad too.</li>
    <li> The color was very nice and true to the color on the box.  I had a bad reaction though.  My skin did not like the organics in this product at all!  For others it is probably a good alternative to regular hair color though.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the most damaging dyes on my hair that I&#x27;ve ever used.  The color turned out OK and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad when using it so that was good.  however, my hair is so dry and brittle as a result of using it.  I do have fine hair but I don&#x27;t recommend that anyone use this and I&#x27;m sorry that I ever did.</li>
    <li> It works amazing!!!  Gives me a rich color that lasts much longer !!!  My new hairdresser actually asked &amp;#34;If I was gray!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewer that the names indicate lighter hair color than the actual color. I have dark brown hair with reddish highlights and I mix 5N and 6N, Light Chestnut and Dark Blonde, about 1/3 and 2/3 respectively. The \\&quot;dark blonde\\&quot; is really medium brown and the \\&quot;light chestnut\\&quot; is much too dark for me by itself. I am also 10-15% gray/white and this product covers beautifully and is permanent.</li>
    <li> I was trying to go back to my natural color after going lighter.  I thought I was a light brown, but the product that looked closest to my natural hair color was Dark Blonde 6N.  It was a little dark at first and I was a little worried, but after a couple of washings it has lightened up and actually stayed the perfect color.  It has been the same for weeks now with no more fading!  I like the fact that it has no harsh chemicals, which is great for your hair.  I will definitely use it again!</li>
    <li> Near from the good work</li>
    <li> This is my second try of this brand. It is totally odorless and feels very gentle to the hair. My only comment is that the real color comes out a few shades darker. For example, the Dark Blonde 6N that I used perfectly matched my relatively dark brunet hair. Not really a complaint, simply a warning that one needs to try a few colors before finding the perfect match</li>
    <li> Wonderful and natural hair color</li>
    <li> I started using Herbatint 3 years ago after about 3 years of consistant salon color {Aveda and Wella}.  I was very happy with the color, total grey coverage (I am 35% gray), the shine, and the ease of use.  I began with 4M, then gradually went lighter (half 4 and half 5M), then just 5M, then half 5 and half 7M to make 6M, plus 6N for the gray.  The color is beautiful and I have gotten compliments on my color with all the Herbatint shades I have used.  BUT, several months after beginning use, I noticed my hairline receding and thinning on the top of my scalp.  I consulted my GYN for thyroid issues, etc. and began using Prevana hair loss products, biotin supplements, topical treatments and scalp massage.  Nothing helped.  My GYN finally asked me about my hair color and I started researching possible effects of Herbatint.  Several users have reported allergic reactions.  After further thought, I remembered my hairline looked noticeably receded after each use.  I always carefully follow product instructions but have occasionally left the product on longer than the 30 minutes.  Without the possible hair loss, I would easily give Herbatint 5 stars. I have continued to use it, trying to apply to my hairline last, and wash off right at 30 min.  I haven&#x27;t found a more natural hair color.  To avoid the excess product on the forehead, as reviewed, apply some cream to your head, just under but not touching your hairline.  The color will then not stick to your skin but still will color your hair. If you are willing to risk the concerns listed in the other unfavorable reviews, then definitely try Herbatint.  But order from an online buying club.  I get mine from Frontier for $8.66 when it is on sale.  HTH ladies!  :)</li>
    <li> Finally. It took me three tries before I read the fine print that says if you need grey coverage (because why else would I be doing this?!), use the &#x27;natural&#x27; line, not the &#x27;ash&#x27; or &#x27;golden&#x27; shades. I am a brunette but I use the &#x27;dark blonde&#x27; shade and it&#x27;s perfect... not so dark that I have to worry about new grey growth announcing itself quite so soon. The best part of this is that I don&#x27;t fumigate the bathroom or pass out while using it because it lacks the noxious crap that domestic hair color producers get away with. There&#x27;s zero odor afterward, and my hair acts pretty happy, at least for the first few weeks. The conditioner that comes with it is pretty great and I wish I could buy it by the bottle. I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for over 15 years and this is the first product I&#x27;ve been happy with.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled - this permanent color changed my gray to a light brown with a little strawberry undertone.  My natural color, however, remains a dark brown.  Overall, the effect is nice, creating a more consistent look which I would describe as a very dark brown with subtle strawberry-blonde undertones and highlights.  The product is easy to use (you only have to mix two provided bottles before applying), and doesn&#x27;t take long (45 minutes to set).  It does leave your hair incredibly dry, so you&#x27;ll need an excellent conditioner after washing out the dye (the provided conditioner only covers really short hair), but that is no different than other permanent hair colorants.  I should mention that I am generally allergic to most colorants, but find this an excellent alternative to the more common brands you see in stores.</li>
    <li> This is probably the BEST hair color I&#x27;ve ever used.  100% gray coverage, no smell of ammonia (it actually had no smell at all) and it made my hair actually shiny and silky smooth!!  If I must say one thing (maybe two), it&#x27;s the fact that you need to mix the solutions in your own container (any plastic container would do...I used the old ice cream container) and also there is no applicator so you have to have a brush to apply the solution to your hair (luckily, I had an old tinting brush that came with a hair color I bought a long time ago).&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that you pick a color that&#x27;s a few shades lighter than your desired color.  I picked &amp;#34;dark blond&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; which is my natural hair color because I read in other&#x27;s reviews that the color comes out much darker than the picture.  And it came out great!  But if you want your hair to be lighter, you need to pick lighter ones, 7N ~ 9N.  That&#x27;s what it says in the direction.</li>
    <li> I use this combined with the 4R Copper Chesnut to get the color I want for my hair.  I lost my hair due to chemo and after it grew back I wanted a plant or animal based hair color and not all the chemicals.  It does not smell at all.</li>
    <li> this product goes on wonderfully.....</li>
    <li> Great product. Does not make your head itch like other brands.  Order lighter color than what you would with other brands.</li>
    <li> After using this hair color, I noticed that my hair would feel very course and straw-like and become extremely tangled each time I washed it. I was alarmed, so called customer service, where they only have one woman available to answer questions, and she told me the reason this happens is because the hair follicle is left open after coloring! I was shocked by this and had no idea this would happen. I am very upset because I have long hair and it will take years for it to grow out. It is not possible to wash my hair unless I use a heavy conditioner now, just to get it somewhat soft and able to run a comb through it. Our hair follicles are not supposed to be left open and it causes split ends!&lt;br /&gt;They should put a warning on their box letting people know this will happen. No other natural hair color that I have used has ever done this, so I had no idea this one would.</li>
    <li> I just got dying my hair with this. Picked it up at my local health store. I had roots growing out from summer and extremely light hair. My hair is brown, but I sun in&#x27;d the hell out of it mid summer. This didn&#x27;t really have a smell and if it does it&#x27;s slight. Beats the hell out of that chemical crap. That stinks! I didn&#x27;t like the conditioner, wasn&#x27;t enough for my hair anyways. I have hair past my shoulders, it&#x27;s curly and thick. One box was enough for me. It seems a bit dark for me, think I&#x27;ll go a lighter color next time. I&#x27;m just glad to use something without chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different at home hair coloring kits, some chemical, and some natural.  With the chemical hair colors, the  color would fade very quickly from shampooing and sun exposure.  After a month or two it was no longer the same color. And there are many unhealthy ingredients in those.  And I&#x27;ve tried henna, which was very permanent but always came redder than what I wanted.  This herbatint hair color is the perfect medium. The color is very dark at first, but after a couple weeks fades to what I would call a light brown color. And after that stays perfectly and doesn&#x27;t fade anymore.  Great for covering up grays.  And doesn&#x27;t contain most harmful chemicals that traditional dyes do.  The only thing is it&#x27;s darker than a dark blonde. As an experienced herbatint customer, I know that all of the colors run about a shade darker than what they say they are.  So this is actually light brown.  If you want dark blonde go then next shade up from this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m spoiled by the other organic, naturtint hair coloring, but I hadn&#x27;t tried this one and wanted to see if it was as good because it&#x27;s a little cheaper.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling as healthy like the other one does, so I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.  I have very fine, wavy hair, and everyone&#x27;s hair won&#x27;t necessarily react like mine, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> I love this dye! Going a lighter shade works perfectly as the color tends to be darker than pictured. Covers grey very well!</li>
    <li> Love this hair color.  Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I returned the product because I noticed the box listed the Phenylenediamine (PPD) chemical known as coal tar, which may cause a flare up (or irritation) of asthma or a dermatitis-type skin rash.  This product may work for others, however.</li>
    <li> Does not cover my gray hairs for long, maximum two weeks, but  leaves my hair with a pretty color and does not make it dry like other hair color products</li>
    <li> Ah, finally, a hair color that didn&#x27;t leave my scalp burning and red!  Just keep in mind that what they call &amp;#34;Dark Blonde&amp;#34; is really a nice lightish medium BROWN.  I brought this to my hairdresser, who applied it only to my roots, and the color blended well with my previous Natural Instincts light brown.  Just don&#x27;t be fooled by the natural name and package design -- this haircolor certainly has chemicals, but in my case, the chemicals were non-irritating.  What a relief to know that I won&#x27;t have to let myself go gray due to the inability to tolerate color products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 5 years and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase using it for 2 years already</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair color &amp;  a great deal... The health food store in my town sells this, it doesn&#x27;t normally carry the color I use, so every time I get it I have to go and order it and then pick it up later... This was fantastic came straight to my house.  Haircolor itself is really nice,  does not leave lots of red tones.</li>
    <li> Good product, all natural good for the hair not like the ones they use in hair salons . Fast shipping, all you could want from a hair paint</li>
    <li> Nice product covers well and allows one to save any unused product for future use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very good expercience. I do recommend!</li>
    <li> Very gentle and very safe.  No harsh chemicals.  Lasts about 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever found.  It covers the gray nicely and lasts a long time.  I use the combination of 5N &amp; 6N to get the right shade for me.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now.  Won&#x27;t ever go back to the store bought colors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Herbatint since 2005, when I could no longer afford visits to my favorite salon every 6 weeks. My hairdresser approved the product and told me how to use it most effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I color my roots every 4-5 weeks. When I open a new box, I use 2 tablespoons of each ingredient to do that; it&#x27;s a little less than half the contents of each bottle. I start with the roots that are immediately visible when my hair is styled in the usual way and time the length of application from that point, then proceed as the box directs. Close the ingredient bottles tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second application 4-5 weeks later uses the remainder of the ingredients. Start as described above, then use any solution not used on the roots to distribute through the remainder of your hair. (I have hair almost down to my waist, and I think this process keeps natural-looking highlights throughout my hair.) Once again, time application from application to your roots and follow product directions from that point.</li>
    <li> This product is the best hair color I have tried.  I would highly recommend it.  I have very dry scalp an have to use no peroxide hair color.  I used to purchase at my local supermarket, but now it has been discontinued.  Amazon to the rescue once again!!</li>
    <li> This hair color is sadly lacking.  I&#x27;ve used several other natural brands and have been pleasantly surprised with the coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Not so with this.  I used 6N.  Back ground- I was a professional hair colorist and am extremely experienced in professional color lines.  I can tell you, this color is horrible.  Not only did it NOT cover any grey, it turned red/orange at the scalp.  It was definitely NOT a 6N.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  Yuck.</li>
    <li> This product line is one of very few I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t irritate my scalp.  On the down side, turns brassy 4-5 weeks after.</li>
