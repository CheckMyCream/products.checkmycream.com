      <li>I love xylitol products.</li>
      <li>I love it and it has helped my teeth</li>
      <li>I love the taste of these mints.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>But if you like that jolt, you&#x27;ll love these.  </li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>,  I already need to buy more.</li>
      <li>I love love love this mint.&lt;br</li>
      <li>He did say that the gum may be a better choice if you are using these as a cavity fighting regimen strictly.</li>
      <li>so if you are a fan of fireballs, you will love these mints.</li>
      <li>I am really enjoying these mints.  </li>
      <li>People are saying that gum does a better job</li>
      <li>Prices and sources fluctuate, and sometimes these are the better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Everyone loves cinnamon and it&#x27;s low in carbs and calories but best of all it contains a lot of Xylitol which deactivates acid causing bacteria.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad to find these.</li>
      <li>Gotta go order more now.</li>
      <li>But Altoids are sweetened with sorbitol instead of xylitol, and xylitol is better at preventing cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for than cinnamon flavored Xylitol mints?</li>
      <li>The top detaches from the can really easily - spilling mints all over everywhere.  </li>
      <li>On the contrary, I LOVE a strong cinnamon kick.</li>
      <li>I love the taste of these, pulse they are sugar free.  </li>
      <li>The mints melt very quickly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an easy way to get 1 gram of xylitol exposure with 2 mints.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to cancel if you&#x27;ve never subscribed before at Amazon.</li>
      <li>With the gum you are chewing and getting great contact with the xylitol on your back teeth (which are everyone&#x27;s most cavity-prone areas of the mouth.)</li>
      <li>People often complain that the cinnamon flavor in those gums passes very quickly, though that varies from brand to brand.  </li>
      <li>cinnamon taste is strong, which I like.</li>
      <li>It is strong in flavor as well.</li>
      <li>There are plastic bottles of 180 mints and refill bags of 1000 mints available from epicdental, but I haven&#x27;t seen them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Still worth it for the benefits of Xylitol!  </li>
      <li>In fact, if Epic decides to make an &amp;#34;Extreme Cinnamon&amp;#34; with even more of a kick, I&#x27;ll stock up!</li>
      <li>Update-I finally tried the Peppermint mints and they are just as good as the cinnamon mints.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any feedback as far as how effective using Xylitol is AND these cinnamon mints are fantastic!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Of course fresh breath was the original reason for mints and another perk of using them.</li>
      <li>Great texture, lasts longer than other xylitol mints I&#x27;ve tried...  </li>
      <li>Wish it didn&#x27;t melt as quickly as it does though.</li>
      <li>I just definitely can&#x27;t handle more than one at a time :).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure it actually translates into better and fresher breath.  </li>
      <li>Freshens breath and dissolves quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on a very limited diet and the zing I get from these mints is amazing!</li>
      <li>BUT it is very hot.  </li>
      <li>Think Fireball hot!  </li>
      <li>We have been chewing this gum for a few years now and so far no cavities. :D</li>
      <li>The added bonus that they help keep cavity causing bacteria at bay in between brushings is pretty cool as well.</li>
      <li>but Epic&#x27;s cinnamon is just a wee bit over the top.  </li>
      <li>Was expecting a mild cinnamon minty flavor, but this flavor is way too hot.</li>
      <li>and they are probably right</li>
      <li>i recommend you subscribe right off the bat.</li>
      <li>While these particular breath fresheners aren&#x27;t truly hard like most cinnamon candies, so they dissolve pretty fast, they still do a great job freshening your breath.</li>
      <li>There should be some indication in the name that these are hot cinnamon.  </li>
      <li>I will know more after my next dental check up.</li>
      <li>I rated these 4 star because they are too too hot for me.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t&#x27; find them too hot, and use them all the time now.  </li>
      <li>But nothing like a fireball where the hot sticks around -</li>
      <li>They fit nicely into my small bag.  </li>
      <li>they really heat up your mouth with the hot cinnamon flavor!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a very limited diet and the zing I get from these mints is amazing! Makes me feel like I&#x27;ve gotten a treat and it fits within my diet plan. I keep a tin in my purse all the time!</li>
    <li> Great tasting and good for your teeth!  I like this brand above all others.  It is strong in flavor as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for a breath freshener and fights bacteria because of the Xylitol, but is useless to combat dry mouth, which is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> What more can you ask for than cinnamon flavored Xylitol mints? Everyone loves cinnamon and it&#x27;s low in carbs and calories but best of all it contains a lot of Xylitol which deactivates acid causing bacteria. You can use these mints after consuming food or soda to put decay on hold until you can go brush and floss. People are saying that gum does a better job and they are probably right but sometimes I don&#x27;t feel like chewing gum and the mints seem a little more mindless and convenient. Of course fresh breath was the original reason for mints and another perk of using them. While I can&#x27;t recommend not seeing a Dentist I can say with the price of dental care and the extremely lame dental coverage most people have (if any) it sure pays to take care of your teeth to minimize the physical and financial pain of living at the Dentist. Also it has been discovered that dental problems can effect the rest of the body.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t last long but are pretty strong</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any feedback as far as how effective using Xylitol is AND these cinnamon mints are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;They make cinnamon redhots seem like cinnamon-light compared to these little yummies.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them by the case load!!!!</li>
    <li> These are nice for a change, slightly pricey for my liking, I typically buy Myntz but get tired of the winter mint flavor. I prefer no sugar type mints as they leave an awful after taste, these work very well for that.</li>
    <li> Handy to use, a little spicy, carry in my purse and use after I eat a meal i I do  not have the xylotal chewing gum</li>
    <li> Great hot cinnamon flavor.  Melt fast and I prefer a longer lasting mint.  Xylitol causes diarrhea if used frequently.  I will make my own erythritol cinnamon mints.</li>
    <li> These were great!!!!  They really do help.</li>
    <li> I like my mints to pack a punch but Epic&#x27;s cinnamon is just a wee bit over the top.  If you do not like sharp, hot sensations on your tongue, I would skip this.  If you do, you&#x27;ll be in heaven. I usually like very strong pungent tastes but these mints actually burn.  I&#x27;m not quite sure it actually translates into better and fresher breath.  The mints melt very quickly so I worry if I&#x27;m getting all the benefits of the xylitol.</li>
    <li> These taste very outstanding for a cinnamon mint product. It seems every different brand of cinnamon flavored mint tastes different. This one has that old fashioned \\&quot;cinnamon toothpick\\&quot; flavor - you know, the ones that you used to dip in cinnamon oil to create? Yeah those! I can&#x27;t speak to the dental benefits as I have only been using these a couple of weeks now. I normally go for cinnamon Altoids (which for me, still have the slight edge overall).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a slightly downside, they are very addictive (I guess it is the \\&quot;heat\\&quot; of the spice and the need to cool it down with the next mint and so on) and they make you want to chew them up about half way through the dissolve (you can sense with your teeth when they have become sort of easily chewed... and crunch!). But are those qualities really a downside?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give them 5 stars if the mints were slightly larger and stayed harder longer before making you want to chew them up. Otherwise, they really are excellent cinnamon flavored mints - dental benefits or no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for the flavor alone!</li>
    <li> These are a nice change from the peppermint or spearmint flavors, with a somewhat spicier flavor to them.  It&#x27;s an easy way to get 1 gram of xylitol exposure with 2 mints.</li>
    <li> remember fireballs and red hots when you were a kid? these mints taste like those. i don&#x27;t think they are as hot as the big fireballs, but taste like the little fireballs in the box. unlike those, these mints are supposed to be good for your teeth. i made a mistake and ate too many at once and made myself sick. i had been craving fireballs before i found and subscribed to these cinnamon mints. that&#x27;s why my review is obsessed with fireballs, if indeed that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re called. so if you are a fan of fireballs, you will love these mints. i recommend you subscribe right off the bat. it&#x27;s easy to cancel if you&#x27;ve never subscribed before at Amazon. in closing, let me say FIREBALLS.</li>
    <li> I love the cinnamon flavor and so good for my teeth, still giving it 5 stars.. I love it and it has helped my teeth</li>
    <li> Seems to be a great product i like the way it&#x27;s packaged. I will know more after my next dental check up.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best xylitol gum out there. If you are used to aspartame gum you won&#x27;t appreciate the fact that the flavor doesn&#x27;t last forever but it does last longer than other gums. We have been chewing this gum for a few years now and so far no cavities. :D</li>
    <li> These taste great, but they are very strong and burn my tounge. I&#x27;m experimenting with xylitol, they seem to be helping my teath.</li>
    <li> Great tasting and good you, helps if you are trying to stop  smoking!</li>
    <li> I have bought these before and really liked the strong cinnamon taste plus they contain xylitol which according to my dental hygienist gets rid of the bad bacteria in the mouth. This time I also bought the peppermint ones as well. I have not tried them yet though. Update-I finally tried the Peppermint mints and they are just as good as the cinnamon mints. A very strong peppermint taste.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a big dummy.  I ordered this thinking it was gum.  Apparently the word \\&quot;mints\\&quot; was now large enough and flashing in neon.  So I was kinda bummed I ordered the wrong thing, but I ended up just trying them anyways.  Wow. Best mistake ever!  To say these are good is an understatement. They are down right addicting. Gotta go order more now.</li>
    <li> Best mints ever and they are good for your teeth :) A bit spicy but that&#x27;s how I like them!</li>
    <li> My Dentist recommended this stuff. I like the taste and it seems to work well for my teeth. Good price</li>
    <li> I love cinnamon flavored candy and these are wonderfully flavored. So good!</li>
    <li> Major name brands frequently have an insignificant amount of xylitol per mint.  These, along with a number of other smaller brands, have at least .5 grams.  This is important to pay attention to because xylitol helps with dental health in multiple ways. First, it does not cause cavities like a sugar-based mint would and by stimulating saliva, tends to repair past damage. Second and more importantly, it can can help prevent future damage from other meals by suppressing bacteria that would otherwise generate cavity-causing acids. The latter is only true if you get enough xyiltol per day, spread throughout the day. From what I&#x27;ve read, that means 6-10 grams every day. With a mint that has .5 grams, you&#x27;ll need to be sure to eat 12 to 20 mints every day to get this secondary preventative benefit.  With major brands that only use a little xylitol, you&#x27;ll never get enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes Spry, another smaller brand is cheaper than these, but not always.  Prices and sources fluctuate, and sometimes these are the better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gum is arguably a better delivery system for xylitol, however it also frequently contains titanium dioxide (which may or may not be dangerous) and it is more expensive.  People often complain that the cinnamon flavor in those gums passes very quickly, though that varies from brand to brand.  The flavor in the mints lasts all the way to end.  As I&#x27;m not a big gum fan anyway, these mints are right up my alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinnamon flavoring in these mints is very, very strong.  To the point that when I tried my first mint, it actually burned a little.  It didn&#x27;t take a week to get used to it, and I consider the strength of the flavor to be a big positive.  Most brands have cinnamon gums, while not many have cinnamon mints.  I also have peppermint mints, and the cinnamon is a nice change of pace.</li>
    <li> My dentist recomended xylitol. These mints pack a wonderful taste. And they are good for your teeth, with very few calories.</li>
    <li> Was expecting a mild cinnamon minty flavor, but this flavor is way too hot. There should be some indication in the name that these are hot cinnamon.  They remind me of the red hot candy fire balls as a kid.</li>
    <li> Taste good and is better for your teeth</li>
    <li> I rated these 4 star because they are too too hot for me.  Think Fireball hot!  But if you like that jolt, you&#x27;ll love these.  I agree with another comment that the ad shows a 15-pack and in reality there are only five -- which  are tossed loose in a kind of junky bag.  They&#x27;re individually sealed with plastic, so not a worry, but think the pic should show the FIVE that they send.</li>
    <li> I ordered the cinnamon mints because at my last dental checkup, I had several small cavities along my gum line.  My dentist suggested it was from all the sugarless breath mints I used every day because I deal with the public in my job.  He recommended that I try mints with Xylitol.  I couldn&#x27;t find the product at GNC, so I ordered them from Amazon.  I don&#x27;t&#x27; find them too hot, and use them all the time now.  They don&#x27;t last long in your mouth and they melt and crumble quickly, but I&#x27;d rather have that than the cavities from other sugarless mints.</li>
    <li> I love love love this mint.&lt;br /&gt;The cinnamon taste is strong, which I like. One mint lasts a long time, which is economical.&lt;br /&gt;The container is slim and easy to carry ,as well as keeping it fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore it may be a bit pricey BUT WELLWORTH IT!</li>
    <li> Freshens breath and dissolves quickly. I like how it comes in packs of 60 (you get five packs with each order). I keep one in my bag, another at my desk, etc. Non-GMO and no artificial flavors nor artificial colors. The mints are white.</li>
    <li> I like these, but I can imagine that not everyone would.  they really heat up your mouth with the hot cinnamon flavor!&lt;br /&gt;Also a note on the packaging... the little hinges on the can covers tend to fail after a few open &amp; close repetitions.  Still worth it for the benefits of Xylitol!  a great price for mints also.</li>
    <li> Tastes great. Wish it didn&#x27;t melt as quickly as it does though. It&#x27;s difficult finding Xylitol mints so I&#x27;m glad to find these. I just want them not to melt so fast.</li>
    <li> Of all the xylitol candy I have tried, and I have tried a whole lot, this is the best tasting out there!</li>
    <li> Different packaging than what&#x27;s shown in current stock photo but same product.</li>
    <li> While these particular breath fresheners aren&#x27;t truly hard like most cinnamon candies, so they dissolve pretty fast, they still do a great job freshening your breath. The added bonus that they help keep cavity causing bacteria at bay in between brushings is pretty cool as well.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying these mints.  I am a big cinnamon/spicy flavor fan.  I was looking to buy xylitol products, as I am addicted to candy. My boyfriend is a dentist, with whom I live with. He is so appalled with my eating habits that we actually have to have separate fridges (not a joke.) He just doesn&#x27;t like to open the fridge and be tempted by my 6-pack of Hershey bars, cokes, ice cream, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He purchased the 100ct Spry gum (peppermint flavor) which is great. He&#x27;s been begging me to try these products to try and replace some of the candies I consume daily, so I finally did when I saw these cinnamon mints. They are a great flavor! Very strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a question for him though: Do the mints have as good of an effect on my teeth as the gum does? With the gum you are chewing and getting great contact with the xylitol on your back teeth (which are everyone&#x27;s most cavity-prone areas of the mouth.) With the mints I feel like it mainly contacts the front teeth. He did say that the gum may be a better choice if you are using these as a cavity fighting regimen strictly. But if you are eating these mints to avoid eating worse foods and candy then they will work just fine! I think that was a great answer.  I now have these mints on Subscribe &amp; Save. I go through about a pack a week, eating up to 10 a day.</li>
    <li> I love the taste of these, pulse they are sugar free.  I love xylitol products. Im so addicted,  I already need to buy more. They are a little hot, but that is what I love about them. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Although it contains Xylitol, it also contains something called Magnesium Stearate which if you perform a Google search it tells you this may not be something you want to put into your body.  The flavor is good, however I don&#x27;t feel good about consuming it.</li>
    <li> These cinnamon xylitol mints are really good. They&#x27;re actually quite expensive for what you get, but for the benefits of xylitol, which are many, make it easier for fork over $16 bucks for 5 small tins. Not to mention, they&#x27;re delivered right to my door by Amazon, so there&#x27;s definitely that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree with previous posters who say the cinnamon is too strong. On the contrary, I LOVE a strong cinnamon kick. In fact, if Epic decides to make an &amp;#34;Extreme Cinnamon&amp;#34; with even more of a kick, I&#x27;ll stock up! I would recommend these and will likely buy again.</li>
    <li> They are perfect and not bad for your teeth. I will be buying these for a long time. The tin is loud so I put them in a plastic bag and keep them in my pocket so they will not rattle when I walk.</li>
    <li> I love the taste of these mints.  They fit nicely into my small bag.  The cinnamon has a nice flavor.  I will buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> very strong cinnamon taste which is what I prefer, melts easily and freshens nicely. I will continue to buy this product</li>
    <li> Love the cinnamon flavor!  Would rather buy just one of the pack...instead of the entire package of the 60 count.</li>
    <li> Helpful for people doing Invisalign tooth straightening process.  Helps dry mouth and freshens breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again when these are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love these. Good price.</li>
    <li> The top detaches from the can really easily - spilling mints all over everywhere.  Kind of makes me wish for plastic.</li>
    <li> Great texture, lasts longer than other xylitol mints I&#x27;ve tried...  BUT it is very hot.  Like others said it tastes JUST like a fireball.  I like the flavor I just definitely can&#x27;t handle more than one at a time :).</li>
    <li> These are great sugar-free mints that do pack a nice hot punch.  But nothing like a fireball where the hot sticks around - this hot is short lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photo on Amazon as of 2 Jul 2012 shows 15 packs.  This is not what you are getting.  What you are getting is 5 of the 15 shown.  The text description is correct, but the photo could be misleading into thinking you are getting what is shown.</li>
    <li> I like these but I wish they had a stronger flavor. For comparison, Altoid Sugar-Free Smalls are quite a bit stronger. But Altoids are sweetened with sorbitol instead of xylitol, and xylitol is better at preventing cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daily intake of xylitol required to have an effect is supposedly around 6-10 grams. Since each Epic mint contains 0.5 grams, that means it would take 12 mints to get the minimum 6 grams. At that rate, a single tin of 60 mints would last only 5 days. That also means you&#x27;ll be accumulating lots of little metal tins, which are not always recyclable. There are plastic bottles of 180 mints and refill bags of 1000 mints available from epicdental, but I haven&#x27;t seen them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One study suggests that it&#x27;s more effective if you space out the xylitol. That makes sense, since it&#x27;s having an inhibitory effect on your mouth bacteria and eventually that wears off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that xylitol is highly toxic to dogs (and possibly other animals). There is risk of hypoglycemia around 0.1 grams xylitol per kilogram of body weight, and liver failure around 0.5 g/kg. In other words, a single mint could be enough to kill a 10 pound dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only 3 ingredients in these mints: Xylitol, Natural Flavors, Magnesium Stearate.</li>
