<ol>
    <li> NEED TO BE COMMITTED TO KEEP USING.</li>
    <li> great product!! it works for me. I actually have hair regrowth by using this item.</li>
    <li> I had chemo treatments and lost my hair. After completing treatments I began using this treatment.  I feel like it has really helped my hair to grow back.</li>
    <li> I saw results after one week.</li>
    <li> did not get dropper with this product, was unable to apply product to scalp.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> HOW CAN I RATE THIS THAT I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED, THIS DONT MAKE SENSE, CAN YOU TELL ME THIS WHERE IS THE BOSLEY I ORDER</li>
    <li> Though this might work for others, I had no growth what-so-ever and have been using the product for 9 months.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working, but it really makes the hair itch real bad; together with other products, the itch is lessen.  I can truly see a different since stating the product.</li>
    <li> This product works but I am allergic to the chemicals in it.  See my review under the Bosley Healthy Hair Follicle Nourisher 2.5 oz.</li>
    <li> Definitely seen improvement in my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a quick delivery and better price!</li>
    <li> this item did meet my requirement however i bought this for my daughter and she started useing this item almost a week and i amm already seeing an inprovement in her hair i would recommend this to my friends and family members&lt;br /&gt;i am qiute satisfied</li>
    <li> no obvious hair increase, but possibly less hair loss.</li>
    <li> After 2 months I saw small hairs sprouting in the front of my head. I don&#x27;t use it as recommended. I used it only after I washed my hair. Maybe if I&#x27;d followed directions I would have new hair growth before 2 months. At first I thought my hair was breaking, then I realized it was new hair. And I also,noticed my hair coloring lasted a little longer. The new hair that&#x27;s growing is fine. I&#x27;ll follow-up on the texture later. But this product works.</li>
    <li> annoying to apply twice daily b/c left a greasy film on my hair, gave me dandruff and didn&#x27;t make a difference in my hair thickness. Disappointing. Admittedly I stopped using after about 3 weeks for the above reasons.</li>
    <li> So far, I like this product.  My hair feels and looks much better since I began using it.  Will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best product to regrow hair. I used it after having my baby and getting bald patches on my scalp. Within a month I had new hair growing in and the rest of my hair grew very long as well.</li>
    <li> i recently started using this product and and seeing results. i reccommend it to anyone with hair loss who wants to do something about it</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I was trying to repair my hair following chemo. I was using a similar product which after a long time managed to stop my hair from falling out but I was looking for more, the fullness I&#x27;d had before. So I ordered this product and in a short while my hair started falling out again. Keep in mind my situation may be different than many others but I feel that my purpose is what the product was advertised for.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for 3 days, and today i woke up super dizzy, and i been dizzy the whole day. It says on the box if that happens i should stop using it. So i will stop for 1 day and see. I am also scared to gain weight cuz this might happen too. I am not sure about this product but seems to have A LOT side effects.</li>
    <li> Definitely makes a difference</li>
    <li> No problems with this product</li>
</ol>
