      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Wife is very happy with it</li>
      <li>I am very happy with my Artemis Woman Heel Smoother.  </li>
      <li>It was perfect!</li>
      <li>so when she tried this one and said it was wonderful, I went ahead and ordered it based solely on her recommendation.&lt;br</li>
      <li>as an excellent one to use in conjunction with the Artemis Heel Smoother.</li>
      <li>Oh, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve done for my socks</li>
      <li>Before I found the incredible Heel Smoother, you could compare my feet to sand paper--and that would be a compliment.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>It works great...</li>
      <li>Combined with the cream healing is great.  </li>
      <li>The cream that comes with it is great, too.</li>
      <li>Great tool for you feet.</li>
      <li>Great for controlling callouses</li>
      <li>did not receive the cream when I purchased mine but after reading the reviews that might have been a good thing.</li>
      <li>I just ordered the Artemis Optimum with recharging dock.</li>
      <li>I bought this on the advice of a friend who had tried it and loved it.</li>
      <li>This appliance does a good job of smoothing roughness.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even better than coming home from a pedicure!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>That was really a trip as it smelled great, made my skin softer and even made them sparkle!</li>
      <li>and I believe she will be thrilled with it.  </li>
      <li>Although it does get warm, I&#x27;ve had no problem with it overheating or quitting.</li>
      <li>This is an awesome tool for keeping my tooties and feet baby soft!</li>
      <li>I wish more women (and men) would take better care of their feet...from what I&#x27;ve seen, this heel smoother should be mandatory!</li>
      <li>By far the best callus removal system I have encountered.</li>
      <li>I do a better job pumicing on my own (it just takes more effort).  </li>
      <li>With the heel smoother I was proudly exposing my feet after the first use.</li>
      <li>Consequently, I always say when something isn&#x27;t great, (particularly food or service at a restaurant - since I wrote the book on Business Lunches!)  </li>
      <li>The Medicool is plug-in electric and has much more power than the battery operated Artemis.</li>
      <li>The heel smoother does just an okay job.  </li>
      <li>I suggest spending your money on a better product.</li>
      <li>what more can I say?&lt;br</li>
      <li>And most important, I don&#x27;t scratch my husband in bed anymore!</li>
      <li>I love the Topaz healing/moisturizing \\&quot;butter\\&quot; that comes with it, too.</li>
      <li>In fact, I have a Dreml type tool that was marketed as a dog nail trimmer that works better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it</li>
      <li>All I can say is I love it.</li>
      <li>My last battery operated smoother did an excellent job, but I can no longer order the replacement sanding pads.</li>
      <li>This one costs 5 times the price of the Artemis but is SOOOO much better</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>, my heels look and feel much better since using the Artemis pedicure wand.</li>
      <li>Then, before my shower I do it one more time on any parts that may still need anymore attention.  </li>
      <li>and I wear sandals most of the time.)</li>
      <li>I wish more women (and men) would take better care of their feet...</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the Artimis Heel Smoother.</li>
      <li>It can&#x27;t be safe for your skin.</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re now smooth as can be!</li>
      <li>This handy tool has quickly removed the calluses (in 2-3 uses); and with once weekly maintainance, they will not return.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I am so particular about my feet that I even trim my own nails before I get a pedicure!</li>
      <li>Anyway, my feet are soft and feel great.  </li>
      <li>It was actually easy to access my heels with this instrument...</li>
      <li>If you DON&#x27;T like what we do, tell US.\\&quot; I live by that - believing that as a business owner, we would want to know if something wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
      <li>Thank you for this fine appliance.</li>
      <li>It still works fine that way -</li>
      <li>I feel so much safer smoothing my heels myself with my own appliance.</li>
      <li>My battery compartment cover no longer stays securely on.  </li>
      <li>Amazing, really.</li>
      <li>One more thing -- when I gave up and decided to return it, I took my Duracell batteries out and they were blazingly hot.</li>
      <li>However, I would say I am very satisfied so far.</li>
      <li>The Artemis Heel Smoother Pedicure Appliance is one I&#x27;ve used for over two months and, on the whole, I&#x27;ve been quite satisfied with both the wand and the results.</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>The motor does get extremely hot, and the batteries die very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Finally I decided it isn&#x27;t worth the time and aggravation, even though it produced good results during the intermittent periods when it worked.</li>
      <li>I insist on products that work well and quickly.</li>
      <li>Smoother adequately takes care of them.</li>
      <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it seems to drain batteries rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>so I also feel the need to share my opinion when I find something that is really super and does what it says it will do.</li>

      <li>The motor in it heats up quickly and the thing stops working.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product after reading all their hype about how quick and easy it is.</li>
      <li>While this Artimis did okay, it sure took a long time.</li>

      <li>They include a free jar of Topaz foot butter which really helps when you use it after treatment.</li>
      <li>it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe the Heel Smoother Pro is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>This product is worth a try.</li>
      <li>The heel smoother is nice for ongoing personal pedicure care/maintanence.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t imagine how much pain I inflict on my feet...from shopping to mowing the lawn to taking the kids to the playground...topped off by my undying love of high heels.  </li>
      <li>The file is just right since you have 2 sized to choose from.</li>
      <li>&quot; She was right.</li>
      <li>Everything for this product is quality built at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t dragon feet, but they do have to be softened pretty often.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never seen batteries get scalding hot like this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A friend told me about this product and since I bought it I find that I can love again (only kidding).  </li>
      <li>I have a problem with cracked heels, especially in the summer, so I am always looking for a better product.  </li>
      <li>I bought this after I read the first review below (the one who gave this 5 stars).  </li>
      <li>I have bought many as gift and as personal use.</li>
      <li>So over time the costs of owning the Artemis will add up -- if the overly hot motor does not burn out.</li>
      <li>and I did notice that the device felt hot after 10 minutes.  </li>
      <li>I went through four intervals of effective operation, heat build-up causing it to quit, waiting a long time for it cool off before starting up again.</li>
      <li>This is a first class company selling a first class product that i highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have bunions on both feet which results in large calluses that could not be loosed with &#x27;Callus Off&#x27; and filed away.  </li>
      <li>The various tips are incredible and last for a long time.</li>
      <li>It does stop if you press too hard which is probably a good thing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great for controlling callouses</li>
    <li> I have bought many as gift and as personal use.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I read the first review below (the one who gave this 5 stars).  It just doesn&#x27;t work very well...I do a better job pumicing on my own (it just takes more effort).  The motor does get extremely hot, and the batteries die very quickly.  The box says it can run for 45 minutes on two AA&#x27;s, but after about 5 minutes...you can feel it slow down.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth it.  I&#x27;m calling today to return it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the advice of a friend who had tried it and loved it. I was a little reluctant after reading some of the other reviews, but my friend and neighbor, Cheryl, swore by it. She had bought a similar product a few months ago and was really disappointed with it - so when she tried this one and said it was wonderful, I went ahead and ordered it based solely on her recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so particular about my feet that I even trim my own nails before I get a pedicure! I only have a pedicure to get the dead skin off of my feet, have them smoothed and to enjoy the experience. (I live in the desert and I wear sandals most of the time.) So I would say I&#x27;m a pretty tough cookie to please. I got my heel smoother yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. It was perfect! In fact I just called Cheryl to thank her for turning me on to it. I love it so much I think I&#x27;m going to get them for my mom and my sister for the holidays. I usually pay between $28 - $40 for a pedicure - so after just ONE use, this has paid for itself and I&#x27;m ahead of the game!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took off all the dead skin and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. The unit was powerful enough without being scary (as when I tried a dremel tool a few years ago - a disaster!) It was actually easy to access my heels with this instrument...I like the way it&#x27;s shaped and it&#x27;s lightweight. I was really surprised at how efficient it is. The cream that comes with it is great, too. I put it on before bed and could really feel a difference this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sold cosmetics about 25 years ago and I know a keeper when I see one. This is awesome. I could have sold a ton of these if they were around back then. I believe in the expression \\&quot;If you like what we do, tell a friend....If you DON&#x27;T like what we do, tell US.\\&quot; I live by that - believing that as a business owner, we would want to know if something wasn&#x27;t good. Consequently, I always say when something isn&#x27;t great, (particularly food or service at a restaurant - since I wrote the book on Business Lunches!)  so I also feel the need to share my opinion when I find something that is really super and does what it says it will do. I wholeheartedly recommend this. If you want your heels to look and feel nice, smooth and keep them from cracking, polish them down with this fabulous instrument. Then polish your toenails and slip into your sandals with confidence. I wish more women (and men) would take better care of their feet...from what I&#x27;ve seen, this heel smoother should be mandatory!staurant - since I wrote the book on Business Lunches!)  so I also feel the need to share my opinion when I find something that is really super and does what it says it will do.

    <li> The heel smoother does just an okay job.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wife is very happy with it</li>
    <li> The heel smoother is nice for ongoing personal pedicure care/maintanence.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it is industrial strength, and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those who have serious feet callous problems.</li>
    <li> It would be better suited for someone who was in their thirties - with less \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; issues. I&#x27;m in my fifties, and despite using a pumice stone and wearing socks to bed with lotion each night, I still end up with alligator heels if I don&#x27;t attend to them every couple of days. It&#x27;s really starting to aggrivate me! While this Artimis did okay, it sure took a long time. I think it&#x27;s partly because the heads cover such a small area at a time. My last battery operated smoother did an excellent job, but I can no longer order the replacement sanding pads. That&#x27;ll teach to wait too long to order extras!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product... Here&#x27;s why:   For some reason my feet get extra scratchy during the winter months (probably from dry weather and cotton socks). I don&#x27;t have any other problems except for the scratchy cracked heels and soles, but it was enough to drive my husband nuts at night because I have a habit of rubbing my feet against him when spooning. I have tried the pedi-egg thing and tons of different lotions, scrapers and files but a day or two later my feet would be rough and scratchy again. This is the ONLY product that has worked for me (and I&#x27;ve been using it on my husband&#x27;s feet too, and he has working man feet, and it&#x27;s doing wonders). I never had problems with it heating up or stalling. It does stop if you press too hard which is probably a good thing. If you have really bad feet, you may want to get a professional pedicure first and then use this for maintenance afterwards. Frankly I&#x27;m amazed at some people using the dremel tool on their feet. That&#x27;s a power tool! It can&#x27;t be safe for your skin. I just ordered the Artemis Optimum with recharging dock. It has a more powerful motor and comes with the heavy duty tips to use on hubby. Can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have very callused feet and they&#x27;re now smooth as can be! It&#x27;s even better than coming home from a pedicure! Great product!</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it seems to drain batteries rather quickly.  I use it regularly after a shower.</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d found this fabulous Smoother before the summer and hadn&#x27;t invested in one of those blade scrapers that make your heels look like a case for the ER--and then spent a lot of money on pedicures!  &lt;br /&gt;  A friend recommended the Artemis and promised me \\&quot;dead skin rolls off\\&quot; and \\&quot;you&#x27;ll never use another BandAid when you do your own pedicure.\\&quot; She was right. This Heel Smoother&#x27;s got it all over other techniques and makes the job worry-free (you can actually follow the plot on \\&quot;Mystery\\&quot; with one ear and tune in to the rotary hum of the Smoother with the other ear), and is surprisingly fast and easy. I love the Topaz healing/moisturizing \\&quot;butter\\&quot; that comes with it, too. &lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Time is my enemy. I live in two places-in the country and in the city--and have a crazy job. The result: little time for myself. I insist on products that work well and quickly. The Heel Smoother was perfect. Amazing, really. I can&#x27;t afford to have bloody feet-a danger with some foot products-as I race around the city, largely on foot, and run in the country. In addition, I am petrified of pain. No problem with the Heel Smoother!  For the person who complained about the battery&#x27;s short life, I recommend a set of rechargeable batteries.  I use them for my digital camera. This product is worth a try. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Oh, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve done for my socks EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I saw the reviews.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of other products throughout my lifetime so far.  Why not try another one, I say to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy it.  I try it.  I love it.  And I don&#x27;t just mean I love it.  I really mean I LOVE it.  It made my horribly dry sandle heels (all I wear in the summer are sandals) smooth as anything you can imagine.  And in the winter, my socks do not snag - not even a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other filing, I found this is better on dry skin.  Do it in the bathroom so you don&#x27;t have all that skin dust around anywhere you don&#x27;t want it.  I do it at night, before bed.  Then I sleep with socks over feet slathered with lotion.  Then, before my shower I do it one more time on any parts that may still need anymore attention.  This will usually last me 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are different attachments, coarse to fine.  I suggest you get all of them as they are inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as a note.  My battery compartment cover no longer stays securely on.  I have to keep it in place with rubber bands.  It still works fine that way - but I can&#x27;t think of any other way (besides tape) to keep it in place.  So, if you&#x27;re breaks - rubber bands will hold it in place.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Artimis Heel Smoother. I have been ashamed to wear sandals for years because of my unsightly calloused, dry, cracked feet. With the heel smoother I was proudly exposing my feet after the first use. Now with only a few minutes a week, my feet look normal. I wish I had known about this sooner. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t imagine how much pain I inflict on my feet...from shopping to mowing the lawn to taking the kids to the playground...topped off by my undying love of high heels.  I&#x27;m a busy mom and my feet look it.  Before I found the incredible Heel Smoother, you could compare my feet to sand paper--and that would be a compliment. A friend told me about this product and since I bought it I find that I can love again (only kidding).  I turned the Heel Smoother on HIGH and watched, with amazement, the dry, dead skin disappear in a cloud of dust. First I started on the back of my heel and worked my way to the front. Then I went to town on my toes with the smaller tip.  Afterwards, I put on the foot butter.  That was really a trip as it smelled great, made my skin softer and even made them sparkle! If Amazon awarded 6-stars to products, I&#x27;d want to give my Heel Smoother a 7. Thank you Artemis Woman!  My feet are ALIVE once again!</li>
    <li> The Artemis Heel Smoother Pedicure Appliance is one I&#x27;ve used for over two months and, on the whole, I&#x27;ve been quite satisfied with both the wand and the results. I do have moderate to heavy areas of heel callouses that need smoothing and the Artemis Heel Smoother adequately takes care of them. It smooths the callous area without burning one&#x27;s skin. Yes, it does take some small effort to keep the rotating head on a particular area, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a drawback. Keeping it on one spot for too long would, undoubtedly, cause a friction burn. Although it does get warm, I&#x27;ve had no problem with it overheating or quitting. I use the copper top Duracell batteries and wish they would last a little longer but that probably depends on how often and how long you operate the wand. I&#x27;ve used it almost continuously for approximately half an hour at a time three or four times a week and have had no problem. I did not expect the unit to be a &#x27;sander&#x27; just a smoother and, as such, have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I did not receive the cream when I purchased mine but after reading the reviews that might have been a good thing. From my experience, I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B000FEWBZS MIRACLE FOOT REPAIR CREAM]] as an excellent one to use in conjunction with the Artemis Heel Smoother. Bottom line, my heels look and feel much better since using the Artemis pedicure wand. ~ Mrs. B.</li>
    <li> This product is a God-send.  I have extremely dry heels.  I have only used the product three times this week and already see positiev results.  Combined with the cream healing is great.  I recommend this product highly and give it 5 stars.  [[ASIN:B000N2U75I Artemis Woman Topaz Foot Butter  (2 Pack)]]</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She says that her feet never felt so soft before. The batteries have not been replaced yet. This item is even better than we expected.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my Artemis Woman Heel Smoother.  I used to go to the Podiatrist to have the calluses removed from the under side of my big toe and on the ball of my foot.  I have bunions on both feet which results in large calluses that could not be loosed with &#x27;Callus Off&#x27; and filed away.  Thanks to the Artemis Woman Heel Smoother, I will no longer have to visit the Podiatrist.  This handy tool has quickly removed the calluses (in 2-3 uses); and with once weekly maintainance, they will not return.  I ordered one for my mother for Mothers Day and I believe she will be thrilled with it.  Thank you for this fine appliance.</li>
    <li> As soon as I touch my foot with the smoother, it stops rotating.  It did not work at all on the tough skin on my heels.  It did work on some small calluses on the tops of my toes, but it took about 2 minutes to wear down the callus.  The motor wore down the batteries fast and I did notice that the device felt hot after 10 minutes.  Basically this device was horrible!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe the Heel Smoother Pro is worth the money.  I would not recommend it because of the cost.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product after reading all their hype about how quick and easy it is. Not. The motor in it heats up quickly and the thing stops working. You wait about 20 minutes for it to cool down and it will start up again. But by the time you are  getting results in one area of your foot, the thing heats up and stops working again. I went through four intervals of effective operation, heat build-up causing it to quit, waiting a long time for it cool off before starting up again. Finally I decided it isn&#x27;t worth the time and aggravation, even though it produced good results during the intermittent periods when it worked. One more thing -- when I gave up and decided to return it, I took my Duracell batteries out and they were blazingly hot. I worry that it might be possible for the batteries to explode from the hot-running motor. I&#x27;ve never seen batteries get scalding hot like this.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Found Something Much Better&lt;br /&gt;After returninng the Artemis, I tried the Medicool PediSenso professional pedicure appliance. This one costs 5 times the price of the Artemis but is SOOOO much better it is well worth it. The Medicool is plug-in electric and has much more power than the battery operated Artemis. It has variable speeds, 5 different sapphire filing attachments, and enough power to operate as long as you need. The sapphire files are different shapes and sizes and should last a lifetime, whereas the Artemis requires repeated purchases of its disposable filing heads and batteries. So over time the costs of owning the Artemis will add up -- if the overly hot motor does not burn out. If you have serious callouses and corns, like I do, the Medicool PediSenso will do a very serious, rewarding job. I&#x27;m so glad I found it and I am grateful for the relief it provides.</li>
    <li> I have cracked heals and a bit of a callous problem.  They aren&#x27;t dragon feet, but they do have to be softened pretty often.  I have used the little blade scraper tool for a few years and that works well but when I saw the Artemis Heel Smoother advertised, I decided I had to try it.  It&#x27;s a waste of money.  The appliance is no more than a low-tech dreml.  In fact, I have a Dreml type tool that was marketed as a dog nail trimmer that works better.  The Artemis appliance does NOT scrape any dried skin away..it merely sands your foot a bit..that is when you can get the darn thing to stay on the spot you put it on.  It comes with a small container of foot conditioning balm that is probably just straight cocoa butter except it has a really offensive aroma.  I would just as soon use a piece of sand paper than this thing.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Artemis after seeing an ad in a magazine.  I was looking for a portable heel sander that during the summer, I could use after showering or swimming.  I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with an A/C adapter.  The power of two AA batteries doesn&#x27;t do the job.  The tips are high quality and abrasive enough to smoothe even the tough skin your feet if only the motor was stronger!  I had really high hopes that the Artemis would be a convenient, quick way to keep my heels maintained on a daily basis.  Unfortunately this isn&#x27;t the case and I am back to a corded sander. I did give it a 3 since it is well made and the tips are superior to other similar products on the market.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have tried to find something like this in a store and no one carries anything like it. The file is just right since you have 2 sized to choose from. This also works well on callouses.</li>
    <li> You know, I&#x27;ve read all the reviews and went ahead and bought the Heel Smoother.  I think it&#x27;s great and I am not an \\&quot;appliance person.\\&quot;  I hate having little gadgets cluttering up my space.  But this is small and  convenient to use.  I keep it by my bathtub and after showering I sit on the edge of the tub and whirr it around my feet for a few minutes each day.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with it heating up or stopping or anything like that.  If you press too hard, it does stop.  But it says that in the instruction book.  It&#x27;s a safety thing.  Anyway, my feet are soft and feel great.  And most important, I don&#x27;t scratch my husband in bed anymore!</li>
    <li> Had looked all over to find one to replace my old.  Great tool for you feet.</li>
    <li> I bought and returned this product.  It has little power and did not do the job for my feet--even after soaking them first.  This is not for bad or heavily callused feet.  I suggest spending your money on a better product.</li>
    <li> I feel so much safer smoothing my heels myself with my own appliance.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome tool for keeping my tooties and feet baby soft!</li>
    <li> My foot was in a cast for two months and was dry, cracked and calloused when it came out of the cast. Artemis Heel Smoother cleared my entire foot of all cracked skin and callouses after only two applications. Everything for this product is quality built at a very reasonable price. They include a free jar of Topaz foot butter which really helps when you use it after treatment. This is a first class company selling a first class product that i highly recommend.</li>
    <li> required slow careful work but did work</li>
    <li> I have a problem with cracked heels, especially in the summer, so I am always looking for a better product.  This appliance does a good job of smoothing roughness.  You have to keep at it, though, and use it 2-3 times a week to see any real results, and it does take time.  However, I would say I am very satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of dead skin due to low thyroid and this is the only tool that has been effective.</li>
    <li> It works great... what more can I say?&lt;br /&gt;My daughter uses it, told me about it, I bought  it...and VOILÁ....!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t apply too much pressure or it will stop spinning completely. Doesnt do the job it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power to it which made it nearly ineffective for me.</li>
    <li> I previously had the identical product which broke due to batteries leaking.  It works for me before, so I decided to go with the same product again.</li>
    <li> By far the best callus removal system I have encountered. I am actually ordering my 3rd one in 6 years I love them so much! The various tips are incredible and last for a long time. I would have given it 5 stars but the one I received this time was defective and didn&#x27;t run. I needed the new tips badly so I decided to keep the useless unit (and throw it away) for the sake of the tips and use them on my old unit. I was very disappointed, however, to be sent a broken unit.</li>
    <li> All I can say is I love it. I wish the tips were available to purchase as some extra for this item.</li>
