<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, Kim Kardashian used it when she had her baby. Scars are fading slowly and surely. Love it, well buy again. You have to be devoted</li>
    <li> Great way to add softness and moisture to your skin.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be working. My pregnant wife has been using it for a month now and she is satisfied.</li>
    <li> It is  working well.  The price is great!</li>
    <li> love it!! great for pregnancy skin tone and scars</li>
    <li> The Bio Oil is such a great product! I had deep pit marks in my face from acne from a teenager, but not any more. Now my face is smooth and youthful looking. And has a shiny glow to it. Also it has gotten rid of horrible scars left over from a breast reduction, the bio oil has smoothed the scars out completely and they are dissappearing daily!..and it hasn&#x27;t even been a year!  It&#x27;s truly amazing</li>
    <li> It is not working at all</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s moist and absorbed in fast ,but it takes a long time to fade my scars.works on my friend faster though</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my skin feel so soft &amp; smooth!  In the winter my skin becomes so dry &amp; itchy that Bio-Oil is a must!  It absorbs into my skin &amp; leaves it feeling hydrated.  I use it on my face &amp; it is not too oily but it does stop my skin from flaking.  It&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
    <li> I started applying this oil from first trimester daily with some affordable moisturizer cream. 1 bottle was enough to me. I am so happy without any stretch marks. This oil doesn&#x27;t work on my old stretch mark.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this basically since she got pregnant and she is at the 9 month mark with no signs of any stretch marks. This stuff works! It is on the expensive side and she did go through about a bottle or a little more per month because she lathered it on really well but hey, if it works, it works and you can&#x27;t put a price on your skin.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.  I have used it for a few years. Arrived on the date promised.</li>
    <li> I heard this was great for stretch marks. It takes time, Does not work overnight</li>
    <li> I tried this product during my second trimester of pregnancy and had a really bad reaction to it based on a recommendation from a friend and the online reviews. I broke out into a rash on all of the places where I applied the product. I spoke with my doctor about it and he said I must have been allergic to one of the ingredients. Needless to say, I stopped using the product and will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This oil is fabulous.  It&#x27;s lightweight which makes it good for all seasons.  I used to buy it from Costco before they stopped carrying it.  I use it mostly on my face and hands when I get out of the shower.  I use it in the mornings before putting on sunscreen and makeup and at night.  It absorbs into the skin quickly and makes it soft and supple.  The 6 oz. is even better than Costco&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff, and a great price.</li>
    <li> Let me just say...holy sh#! I have a HUGE surgical scar on my tummy from a  anterior  posterior back fusion. So, basically, they went in through my stomach to fix my back. This scar is totally hideous! 2 bottles of Bio Oil &amp; it&#x27;s 1/2 way gone. This is excellent scar treatment. Finally!</li>
    <li> we both(my wife &amp; me) have been using it since 3 years. we would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy for something you might want to use.</li>
    <li> I really like it and amazon has the best price.  Some of the ads I&#x27;ve seen in magazines say it&#x27;s not oily and that&#x27;s a lie.  It&#x27;s an oil.  It&#x27;s oily.  But it absorbs quickly and I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I&#x27;m only 17.5 weeks but have been using this stuff at least 1x a day, I try to do two but sometimes I&#x27;m too lazy :) Anyways, I don&#x27;t think stretch marks would be starting YET, but I do feel the product keeps my skin moist throughout the day. It&#x27;s easy to put on and the smell isn&#x27;t too bad! I&#x27;m hoping this will help keep the stretch marks to a minimum, will follow up with a review after baby arrives and how stretch marks are at that point, but I recommend it as of right now as it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Feels nice.  Not oily atvall and seems to be be helping my stretch marks</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.  I gained 50+ lbs during my pregnancy and did not get a single stretch mark!  It is very important to use consistently (every morning and night).</li>
    <li> Bio-Oil is a great product to use I you have scars or marks. You can start to see results after about a week. ditch the creams and body lotions and use bio-oil. Great value for your money</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! I use it on my tummy and chest every day, twice a day all throughout pregnancy. I&#x27;m 28 wks and so far, no stretch marks! Will update after pregnancy is over :-)</li>
    <li> This is great oil. No stretch marks in my tummy so far ... :) Perfect for pregnancy also smells good (not too bad, if you don&#x27;t like fragrances)</li>
    <li> I have definitely noticed a reduction in the appearance of my stretch marks. Obviously, they&#x27;re still there :( But this has faded them. Not the greatest scent. I am still nursing, and I make sure to put a layer between baby and me after use. It&#x27;s very oily!</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feel softer, but I don&#x27;t notice it fading my scars very much. Would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil since purchased. Have not noticed any difference. Smells nice and soothing. Will finish bottled, but will not purchase again. To expensive to waste time and $$$ for not seeing any improvement.</li>
    <li> Always excellent, have been using for years and i like the big size and good price.</li>
    <li> I just received my Bio Oil in the mail, and I can say with certainty that this is a knock off.  This is not Bio Oil.  The liquid for Bio Oil is ALWAYS translucent and tinted an orangey color.  The oil I received was so foggy I could not see the letters printed on the back of the bottle, and it was only filled to the half way mark of the &#x27;B&#x27;.  I don&#x27;t understand how this fraud has so many good reviews when this is literally baby oil in a bottle.  Speaking of that, this smells NOTHING like the real Bio Oil.  If someone knows how I can report this guy/girl please let me know.</li>
    <li> Other than the fact that this stuff is extremely toxic I&#x27;m sure its great. Who wouldn&#x27;t want to slather on a bunch of carcinogens and toxic substances twice a day. [...]</li>
    <li> I received it yesterday. I will use it everyday and update you guys on the results in two months.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and buy now- This stuff is pure gold. It&#x27;s a miracle oil. Fades minor scars and overall skin health and appearance. I have a hard time with showing off my legs...blemishes, uneven skintone etc. Put this on after your shower and the next day-Voila! Smooth even stems! I just finished my bottle and purchasing more. I&#x27;m a natural alternatives person--I use oils for all mositurizing--skin&amp;hair usually coconut, olive, avocado etc. for everyday use. So when I use bio oil which isn&#x27;t as regularly ($$$) I can REALLY notice the difference.&lt;br /&gt;--Use sparingly this bottle will last you a long time and give you amazing results.--</li>
    <li> Heavier oil than I thought it would be, definitely use on damp skin.</li>
    <li> this is magic in a bottle. it worked a wonders on my pregnant belly. do date I have zero stretch marks thanks to using this product throughout my 9 months :)</li>
    <li> I used this several times a day during the second and third trimesters of my pregnancy. It kept my stretching skin from getting itchy, and I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark. I think a lot of times stretch marks are hereditary, and I didn&#x27;t gain a ton of weight, so it&#x27;s tough to say if this totally prevented them, but I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a shot! I&#x27;ll definitely use it during my next pregnancy.</li>
    <li> This is my new version of lotion.  I&#x27;m prego and haven&#x27;t developed any stretchmarks yet (still have the &amp;#34;pre-existing condition&amp;#34; ones) but hoping this stuff makes the difference.  I ordered the big bottle and am glad I did - this will be a staple in our medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had stretchmark on my breasts since I was 11 years old.  I had 2 children and they got way worse.  I&#x27;ve recently gotten a breast lift with an augmentation and it just made the stretchmarks more prominent.  I have been using the bio oil for almost a month now and the marks on my right breast have virtually disappeared.  They are so faint I&#x27;m shocked. The ones on my left breast are still there but much smoother and lighter.  I also use it on my face.  My boyfriend kept telling me  I looked like I had a glow and it made me look beautiful. The fine lines on my face are much smoother as well.  I&#x27;m going to be 30 and people think I&#x27;m 23, I love it. The oil is light and has a soft scent.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is when I sweat it makes me feel oily.  But otherwise this is a good product. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with staining my clothing whatsoever and I use it twice a day. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to distribute on ur affected areas so the bottles lasts.</li>
    <li> works great-recommended to me by a massage therapist for rubbing on scars, works well for dry skin too</li>
    <li> Amazing for scars and skin in general!!!</li>
    <li> i have only been using it for a few days so I can&#x27;t say much yet but the good things i will say is its smells really good and makes my skin very soft and shiny :)</li>
    <li> very good and i love it!</li>
    <li> I have gone through several bottles over several months and have seen ZERO change in my stretch marks. Granted, I&#x27;ve had them since a teenager from a growth spurt and am now in my 30s. Maybe this works only if you immediately use it after getting stretch marks?</li>
    <li> This was a very nice size for the price and it also has a nice fragrance to it</li>
    <li> It works. My stretch marks are fading. I have them on my arms and it is so annoying. but I can tell the bio-oil helps. I use it day and night. Every month I use a derma-roller and then apply the bio-oil for better penetration. I still have the bastard stretch marks but I guess they are easier to hide now with a little cover-up</li>
    <li> Love this product, have been using it for 1.5 years now, looks to work. This is the best price I could find on it anywhere.</li>
    <li> Product truly works. Much better than other products that promise the same results</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Used it for my first pregnancy &amp; got no stretch marks at all. Now I&#x27;m pregnant again so it was a no-brainier!!!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. I used it for a year and it did great. Slow results but there were results. I recently started using it with &amp;#34;body merry skin cream with Shea butter&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m so thankful, my results are coming even quicker! I thought I would be stuck with stretch marks forever after having my twins almost 10 years ago. I use them both two times a day as directed. And also with sit ups and crunches to help my stomach go down. I suck at exercising bit I do what I can and I&#x27;m so happy with my results. I&#x27;ve been using both products together do about 4 months and already see a dramatic difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this while pregnant for it helped my prevent stretch marks. Highly recommend! It&#x27;s the best buy its the largest bottle you can buy.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer with a delightful mild fragrance. Does not compete with your signature cologne.</li>
    <li> My bottle was cracked almost half the contents leaked out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bio oil somewhat inconsistently as I have scars (I&#x27;m Afro-Caribbean) from childhood eczema, volleyball floor burn scars, scars from self-harm...my skin&#x27;s a scarry mess.&lt;br /&gt;Over time, it has reduced the appearance of my dark scars.&lt;br /&gt;I recently had surgery, and immediately, my surgical scar started to hyperpigment. I started using Bio oil on it once the incision closed and pretty much the day after (no exaggeration, I&#x27;m not a paid reviewer) the scar started to improve in appearance. The newer the scar, the better and faster the results will be as with anything else for scar removal and skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m no longer using Bio oil on my scar (I got some pure lanolin oil from a colleague and that&#x27;s working a bit better on my incisional scar) I plan to continue using it on my legs and now my face as I find the lanolin oil to be too thick to want to put it on my entire body (I tried it Bio oil on my face once and I didn&#x27;t break out but it&#x27;s pretty greasy, I&#x27;ll only use it at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I think if you use it more consistently it will help. It also worked better on my oldest scars that had already begun to fade because of aging, so it seems like it struggles the most with very dark scars that are somewhere in the middle of the timeline. The eczema scars on my thighs are responding better than the newer and darker scar from eczema on my calf. I&#x27;m trying to get my legs to the point where I no longer have to cover them with Sally Hansen&#x27;s perfect legs or whatever it&#x27;s called, and hoping consistent use of this will get me there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan to try it to see if it&#x27;ll have the same effect on my face and some new dark stretch marks on my hips that appeared with recent weight gain. I will probably update my review but I don&#x27;t think I can bring myself to take photos, I find my scars so disconcerting...but maybe I will...for science! Lol&lt;br /&gt;Not giving 5 stars cause it&#x27;s not as natural as I&#x27;d hoped, but as with anything, the dose makes the poison. It&#x27;s working, I&#x27;m not dying or getting sick so I&#x27;m not going to let a few chemicals scare me away. Everything is technically a chemical.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this product. A girlfriend of mine uses this to help lighten age spots and her skin looks amazing! I do think some of my spots have already lightened, but maybe it&#x27;s wishful thinking as I haven&#x27;t used it very long yet. But seeing her results I&#x27;m a believer. Use it twice a day faithfuly.</li>
    <li> I had this before. I use it almost everyday on my fat marks. But the mark is still there....I will keep use it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product!</li>
    <li> Great stuff good price</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my stretchmarks but made my skin very soft and moisturiezed.</li>
    <li> Not really sure how this works. But wife said ok with her.</li>
    <li> Great at reducing scars</li>
    <li> Only need a little for each use.</li>
    <li> I only had it for a week so not sure how good it works, haven&#x27;t been working out but have been putting it on stretch marks 2 times a day. Shipping was faster than it said it would arrive.</li>
    <li> I like the oil very much.</li>
    <li> Came on time and the price was right</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I use it  daily.</li>
    <li> I used to buy bio-oil in HK, it was not cheap there. So I choose to buy on Amazon. Really cheap though I hate the smell but I can continue use it for  some scars.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for a couple of years. No, it is not a miracle maker and will not make your wrinkles dissapear! I use it nightly in addition to night cream. It is not greasy and makes your skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I love this product, been using it for years, helps with stretch marks and allergy marks.also smoothen the skin, makes the skin looks health and smooth.</li>
    <li> I found that the oil never absorbs into my skin. I felt very oily all day.</li>
    <li> I used this throughout my pregnancy and it helped significantly with the itching. I also have no stretch marks now postpartum.</li>
    <li> I love Bio Oil I will not say that it is a miracle worker or make some crazy claim that I have been healed of some ailment lol. But it does absorb nicely and I do feel that my skin has responded well to using it. I will continue to use it especially when I can get such large bottles at a steal!</li>
    <li> Item just as described</li>
    <li> I love bio oil. I really see a difference when I use it. My skin is smoother and the tone evens out over time. Also, not irritating and it smells nice. Good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Bio Oil multiple times and finally went for the 6.7 ounce bottle. I use it on my stretch marks from gaining weight. The stretch marks were &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and it took my stomach to an angry red line mess to barely noticeable. Bio Oil does have a distinct smell, citrus-like, maybe an orange. It&#x27;s okay, not a bad smell, but definitely noticeable. Bio Oil is a bit messy. It tends to leave oil marks on any surface the bottle comes in contact with. Which is fine, just wipe it up or do it in your bathroom. Quantity wise, I have never found myself going through Bio Oil at an alarming rate. The price is a bit high, but I&#x27;m expecting the 6.7 ounce to last me 2+ months, so worth it in my opinion. At the end of the bottle you can really stretch the use too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, keep in mind. Stretch marks will never 100% go away, they are essentially scars. Bio Oil helped mostly with the coloration. You will still be able to see stretch marks even with Bio Oil. Personally, the stretch marks went from a red-purple to a shiny white (a whiter white then I am and I&#x27;m pale as can be). Bio Oil also thinned the stretch marks a bit. I call this successful. They will never fully disappear and do not believe anyone that tells you different (with the exception of drastic measures).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps: I think the fact I was treating new scars might have helped make Bio Oil so successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product I would recommend for stretch marks, I hope it works for you like it did for me!</li>
    <li> I have really dry &amp; finicky skin when it comes to products. But this is amazing! Recommend it! Especially for the harsh winter months</li>
    <li> Great product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil to use. It helps maintain a youthful look and is wonderful for a pregnant woman&#x27;s belly (that&#x27;s why I bought it). Enjoy.</li>
    <li> By no means a miracle worker. However it does show some difference after use. Nothing to write home about. The 5 star reviews seem to be paid reviews.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from psoriasis, this oil is the best thing for those horrid flaky plaques! It calms the skin and moisturizes without being greasy. I combine this with a really mild lotion like Eucerin and it works perfectly for my dry skin. I can&#x27;t rave enough about it.</li>
    <li> Would recommend to anyone who needs removal of dark areas on their skin. Follow instructions carefully and all will be well. .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 4 months pregnant and have been using it for 1 month now. I apply it twice a day, everyday. As of now I still love this product, we&#x27;ll just have to see how effective it really is at the end of my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Great product and works well for the skin. Good bang for the buck. This larger volume version is cheaper than the one that I found at Costco.</li>
    <li> Has worked so far to keep stretch marks away and keep my skin very moisturized.  Oily at first, but dries pretty quickly - at 25 weeks pregnant, still no sign of any stretch marks.  Will continue using on a daily basis (twice a day) and hopefully will not develop any.</li>
    <li> its cheap and good for skin</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Smells great, makes your skin feel so soft!</li>
    <li> So I started using Bio-oil towards the end of my second trimester. I do not have any stretchmarks but I don&#x27;t know if that has anything to do with this oil.  I&#x27;ve heard if your mom has stretchmarks, you are most likely to get them as well.  My mom don&#x27;t have any so I am assuming that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t get any either. My baby is 10 weeks old now and I am still not back to my normal weight, I still have 6 more lbs to go. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll get any once I lose those lbs.  Anyway, I don&#x27;t know if this oil helped or not but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try if you are wondering. It moisturizes and don&#x27;t smell bad so you could use it and hope for the best!</li>
    <li> This stuff is &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34; but it makes a really nice bath oil. Just a small squirt will leave your skin silky soft, and it has a nice scent.  It is NOT, however, good for reducing age spots, scars, etc.</li>
    <li> Great product and I could feel a huge difference with my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on the face as it caused me to break out. I initially bought this to prevent scars from mosquito bites and it worked! I have sensitive skin and am allergic to all scented lotions. This has a very light scent but I didn&#x27;t have any allergic reactions!</li>
    <li> i exceeds my expectations i like the feel and the smell of the product and how if made my skin feels . i recommend it</li>
    <li> If I could give this product more than 5 stars, I would. Let me tell you my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago I bought a new product made with charcoal (won&#x27;t mention the brand or name) and it was formulated to minimize pores. I didn&#x27;t use it until this past week. The mentioned face wash BURNED my skin. My cheeks, chin and forehead were on fire. My skin was cracked, red, itchy, swollen and EXTREMELY dry. I tried using moisturizer, aloe vera, Vaseline... EVERYTHING was hurting my skin even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend told me about Bio-Oil and I decided to give it a try. Immediately after the first application my skin felt so much better. As I was massaging the oil into my skin I could feel the peeled skin coming off. My face wasn&#x27;t feeling itchy anymore, and the dryness disappeared immediately. It only took 2 applications of this oil to make my skin heal almost completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it on a daily basis, two times a day (morning and night) and my skin has never felt so healthy. This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried, and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried A LOT.</li>
    <li> I had weight loss surgery and i was told that using these oil combined with cocoa butter lotion helps reduce the stretch marks apperance. I have been using it all over my body for about 3 weeks and I see a difference. I am losing weight pretty fast so i need my skin to stay very hydrated so I will not as much excessive skin and so far so good. If youve had WLS, try this oil!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product.  I used it after a big abdominal surgery and my scars are barely visible.  It felt so great I now use it after my shower as an all over moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Love it. So far no new stretch marks with my second pregnancy.  Fingers crossed</li>
    <li> This is the best facial oil I have tried. It evens out your skin tone and makes your face supple and glowing. It also smells like a really expensive spa treatment. It also fades stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Excellent, but you must use it 3-4 times a day If you are pregnant!</li>
    <li> I started using this about 7 months pregnant. I have tried a few stretch mark creams/oils/lotions and found them either smelly, thick, irritating, or even causing me mild itchy rashes (I do not have sensitive/ reactive skin normally). This product is amazing! It does not irritate my skin at all and while it is an oil, my skin absorbs it and it is so easy to spread (and does not stain any of my clothes!)... my husband even comments on how good it smells and continues to compliment me smelling nice everytime I put it on which I do morning and night).  Smell and texture aside- I love it! My skin feels super soft and it gives my skin a nice glow (great on legs too)  &#x3D;)  I think genetics play a huge role in whether or not we will get stretch marks but I am crediting this product for my luck and good fortune... so far (at almost 38 weeks) I have zero stretch marks on my stomach to report!!! (I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; until the last few weeks and with such a rapid belly growth spurt I am so thankful I started using this product in time!!).... On a side note- I do suffer from stretch marks all over my thighs and butt but so far haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones since using this. All in all- I love this product so much I plan to keep using it post pregnancy as a preventative as well as a way to hydrate my skin.</li>
    <li> Love using this product I&#x27;m irish so i  get red and have like a reddish look in my skin but this product balances this out and and makes me look olive and white do not wear in the summer time unless you wanna tan it will make you burn faster.</li>
    <li> Use it daily for my dry skin, especially my legs.</li>
    <li> Well, I got this to reduce the appearance of stretch marks, but found out it was actually just a great all-around moisturizer. Really excellent to put on sunburns, especially once they start peeling, since it soothes the skin and helps reduce peeling. Fairly nice scent, not strong. Oil absorbs over night, and it is not overly heavy. As for the stretchmarks, I have barely seen any improvement... for the price, I would not recommend it for this purpose (deducted a star for that). Works well in small amounts as a facial treatment too.</li>
    <li> Used it four days and I thought I saw improvement on myacne until my husband made a comment to confirm it. :-)  !!!!</li>
    <li> I am seven months pregnant and have been using bio oil since month 3.  It has really helped with preventing stretch marks.  So far, I only have a couple very tiny marks on my thighs that can hardly been seen.  I will continue using bio oil after pregnancy as well.  It makes your skin extremely soft!</li>
    <li> Good product! Price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Awesome moisturizer and it smells good</li>
    <li> my wifes pregnant belly seems very grateful</li>
    <li> If you could only have one moisturizer, this should be it. I use this on arms, hands, neck and face and even on knees or feet when needed. Bio-Oil has a good feel and is easy to use. The bottles last a long time even with generous use. I have turned back a lot of sun damage on my hands and arms with the Bio-Oil alone, and there is a youthful glow when used on the face. I also no longer get cracked skin on my hands too. One good application in the morning can last all day long on most days. I now also use StriVectin SD on my face and neck and have had even more noticeable good results with both (follow the StriVectin with the Bio-Oil; the StriVectin rebuilds the collagen long term, where the Bio-Oil immediately and noticeably moisturizes).</li>
    <li> arrived at the given day. excellent.</li>
    <li> Many people said that this oil didn&#x27;t work.  Well if you follow the directions you will see good results in about a week.  Bio oil needs to be kept in a cool place, so I kept mine in the refridgerator.  Lol!  Also, you have to use it twice a day.  I used it in the morning, after my bath and in the evening, after my bedtime bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, I love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;i am using it on a 15 yr old open heart surgery scar, and it is working! it works on everything.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to find Bio-Oil Purcellin Oil Moisturizer, 6.7 Ounces, in such a large size and at such a great price.  A really good deal and fast shipping too!!</li>
    <li> havent seen ANY change in my stretch marks. the only reason for the 2 stars is that it does make my skin feel nice.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is a wonderful mosturizer, I even use it on my hair.  I feel that my skin is years younger.</li>
    <li> I liked this product initially, but after two application I started to have itchy rash all over my belly and I had to stop using it. I think I am allergic the oil used for this product...</li>
    <li> no stretchmarks, scars are slowly disappearing and smells nice. not oily on skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, Fantastic Price!!!!</li>
    <li> Great price prompt delivery thank you</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t stop using ... Absorbs well and very effective</li>
    <li> My favoritest pregnancy indulgence.  I coat myself in this stuff day and night.</li>
    <li> just starting using this oil and I like the way it leaves your skin not to oily and has a scent when first put on but not lasting which is really nice, especially now for the winter I think this moisturizer is going to do the trick. I want my husband to try it and I think he will be please with.</li>
    <li> I love it! I use my Bio-oil on my hands and face, it has since removed all my scars.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and seemed to help!</li>
    <li> This oil is fake. For those who haven&#x27;t use bio-oil before or just don&#x27;t notice this oil has a different smell, color and feel. It&#x27;s like baby oil and food coloring. Was really disappointed because I didn&#x27;t expect this for Amazon,  Ebay yes. But not Amazon. Need to be way more careful while shopping</li>
    <li> Great product. For use to combat dry skin, to keep subtle soft skin, to help reduce appearance of scars.  Have used it for years. My husband uses it, too. Good for sensitive skin, too. The scent is soft and mild. I often find it sold out at stores and am delighted to find it on Amazon. Will be buying again and again.</li>
    <li> Has made my skin super soft..... I haven&#x27;t used it for long to see any changes in my stretch marks. Smells very good.</li>
    <li> This item arrived in horrible condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a health product, there was no type of seal around this package and it was difficult to know if this was a used product or not.  Highly dissatisfied.  I called and was told there was nothing that could be done..</li>
    <li> I have scars from rash I had last year.  This product has reduced their appearance, but you must be patient.  It does take several weeks to see results</li>
    <li> Still using, smells really good. Great price</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and in good order.  As for the product itself, I&#x27;m not sure if i would order again.  It&#x27;s greasy and you will have to take a few moments for it to absorb into your skin or it will stain your clothes.  In all honesty, Bio-Oil reminds me of a pink overpriced bottle of baby oil.</li>
    <li> I did not like it because I had an allergic reaction to it. I liked the scent.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any results so far but I haven&#x27;t been using for 2 months.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It melts into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue.  I have very dry skin and itch constantly.  This has put a stop to all itching.  I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I have stretch marks on my behind and thighs that I was rather self conscious about. Heard about this and decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES WORK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stretch marks were rather fresh, the red ones rather than the white ones, AND it does take some time, took about half the battle or so but I definitely started seeing my stretch marks lightening and eventually dissapearing completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah it works, but you have to be patient! I used it once a day after I showered.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering a second bottle for stretch marks on my stomach now.</li>
    <li> I use this as a night time moisturizer. I&#x27;m older as well as live in a dry climate so my skin drinks this up.</li>
    <li> For my wife&#x27;s belly since she&#x27;s pregnant she has only one stretch mark this this is so good, used right after the shower i guess because it has worked so good skin all soft and all</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and product was exactly what i ordered. No issues and would def. order again.</li>
    <li> Just scented baby oil. No benefit for already existing stretch marks. I used it daily for a month and still no change. Shipping and packaging was good.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  My skin looks awesome and glows.  Even my doctor made a comment that my skin looks great.  I use it right out of the shower when my skin is still wet, then towel dry.  hey, it IS oil, so this process leaves my skin in perfect shape, not too oily, not too dry.  just perfect.  it smells spicy, cinnamony... sweet.  I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I waited 3.5 months till I put up this review to give it time to really make a noticeable difference. I am amazed with the difference in the skin tone on my body. Amazing. I highly recommend this product you will not be disappointed just give it a few months to really do it&#x27;s magic.</li>
    <li> The best real oil on the market...</li>
    <li> Did not help with stretch marks stained clothing</li>
    <li> It arrived with the box ripped, package was open and the oil is not as clear as the ones I&#x27;ve used before. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I have always loved this stuff and I love the smell.  Ummmmmmmmmmmm</li>
    <li> Seems To Work Well Helps With Itchy Pregnant Belly Not Sure Yet If It Helps With My Stretch Marks Tho.</li>
    <li> Wonderful skin oil. Initially started using only on skin blemishes and scars. Now use it daily on arms, legs and face.This is so smooth and feels hydrating without being oily. Just take time and rub it in. No fragrant smell noted and  it leaves no residue on your clothes or furniture. Skin looks much better too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service</li>
    <li> must use every day and you really dont see results untill maybe the end of the first month also leaves a sweat like stench behind</li>
    <li> Smells great and so far I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> Good price &amp; fast shipping !</li>
    <li> I love this oil - I use it instead of cream.</li>
    <li> It didnt do anything just buy mederma. Cheap stuff never works</li>
    <li> I used this during my first pregnancy and got no stretch marks at all. Just ordered another bottle for baby number 2!</li>
    <li> Since my stretch marks are a bit older it takes a while for it to fade but I notice that bio oil does wonder to my face. I use it as moisturizer at night and it shrunk my pores!</li>
    <li> So far so good, time will tell.</li>
    <li> When I remember to use it, I love it! I usually use it at night while I am watching TV.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! Be patient and you&#x27;ll see results. This is the cheapest place that you can get this amount for. This 6.7 oz bottle is $30 anywhere else, fyi.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about a month, haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference and I am also not a fan of the smell but plan to give it some more time and continue using.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product and I&#x27;m not a fan. The smell is overwhelming and not in a good way, and it is way too oily. Not to mention, after using this product for less than 2 weeks I developed a rash on my arms- there are these little bums around my stretch marks! And after researching, I found out I&#x27;m not the only one that this has happened to. The formula used in Bio-Oil  has mineral oil. Which is also used in Johnson&#x27;s Baby Oil! And I know that I&#x27;m allergic to Johnson&#x27;s baby oil, because when I use it I get rashes  all over. Now I&#x27;m stuck with this and it was a totally waste. So beware everyone :( Especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels with this oil.  It may be just baby oil with added ingredients, but I love that I can use it on face and body.  I have used many products over the years, mostly creams and body butters, but Bio-Oil has become my #1 favorite.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! LOVE IT!!!!! LOVE IT!!!! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement</li>
    <li> This seems to be fancy baby oil or mineral oil. Smells okay. Has a pink color for some reason. Been using for a few months now and really doubt it&#x27;s effectiveness. I would imagine it gives the same results as any baby oil....it moisturizes your skin quite well, stays on easily enough but leaves you greasy and hands greasy as well.</li>
    <li> Living in the midwest during winter your skin dries out so much. This is the only product after trying literally 100&#x27;s that keeps me moisturized all day. I have one elbow that has had exceedingly dry peeling skin as I lean on it all day while at work. Bio Oil is the only thing that stopped the irritation and dry skin. Bio Oil has a nice light fresh scent as well. Will stop looking for that miracle moisturizer as I have found it.</li>
    <li> Not sure why the oil has a separate between white and pinky liquid. Wondering if it has gone bad or fakeone....  The other two bottle that I ordered online from Walmart are fine.</li>
    <li> I have used Bio-Oil for over 10 years. My skin is amazing. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I love it</li>
    <li> Just a bit too oily for my liking.  I know, it&#x27;s oil - but the fact is it ruins my clothes!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!! I will be ordering more!!</li>
    <li> this works well for me as a makeup primer.  just give it a few minutes to absorb into skin.</li>
    <li> Helps to soften skin and fade stretchmarks</li>
    <li> Very Oily and takes time to dry before you put your clothes on</li>
    <li> Love the way this stuff smells. It really moisturizes my skin well. I&#x27;m planning on using this during my entire pregnancy to help prevent stretch marks. Its also great for dry winter hands. My husband works outdoors and during the cold months his hands are so dry. I have him use this and they look great and feel great. No more sandpaper hands. Plus Amazon&#x27;s cost is so much better than buying in the store.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for stretch marks, but started using it on my arms and legs. I&#x27;ve suffered from keratosis pilaris on my arms and thighs my whole life and have tried everything to get rid of it. A few weeks of using the oil and it is totally gone! The small scars from scratching at it are highly diminished as well. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Still working on my stretch marks, but even if it doesn&#x27;t work as well on those, this was money well spent. And it smells great too!</li>
    <li> Have been using this oil for about 4 years, Love it.</li>
    <li> work perfect on my body always use it for my skin. It is not greasy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works unbelievably good ! Just sad I didn&#x27;t get it before the stretch marks</li>
    <li> It works real good even tho it takes longer time .. But I can see the result on my stress marks</li>
    <li> love this product and awesome price!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves by this stuff puts it on every night</li>
    <li> product as described, shipped quickly and great price.  a nice product recommended by a family member, but it&#x27;s not all that she had described</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> This is a an affordable and effective alternative to the costly Mederma for scarring. When used twice daily, it also makes a great all-over moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Great product I used palmers with my first pregnancy and ended up with many stretch marks this time around I started using bio oil and I am bigger I&#x27;m size and not one so far!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I have been using this product since I was 18 weeks pregnant, I am currently 32 weeks and I haven&#x27;t developed any stretch marks. Plus this keeps my skin moinsturized..</li>
    <li> Emollient and very moisturizing. I have not seen any reduction in  my scar, but it does leave my skin soft. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell of this either. Also, don&#x27;t dress immediately after use as it will &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; stain your clothes.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, but I use it up very quickly. Amazon has the best price, but it&#x27;s still costly. Back to Neutrogena light sesame oil.</li>
    <li> I totally love this oil. I quit buying expensive night creams and just use this. I use 5 drops, rub my hands together and massage it into my face. It isn&#x27;t oily after awihle.</li>
    <li> Great for moisturizing and scars</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing!! It totally helps with stretch marks, I use this religiously, I have 4 children and this is my favorite stuff to use.</li>
    <li> I use this daily for both my post-pregnancy stretch marks and scars I had from surgeries.&lt;br /&gt;It has softened up the hard scar tissue and reduced the appearance of my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I had read many great reviews on this product,but I am currently on bottle #2--and have been using it faithfully for at least 6 weeks, but I have not seen any noticeable differences in my stretchmarks, dark spots, dry skin, or incision scars.</li>
    <li> fast, and as discribed</li>
    <li> Great thank you wonderful seller</li>
    <li> I have been using it on my stretch marks for four months, but it&#x27;s not working at all.... It smells good though..</li>
    <li> This was a gift from my mom. I actually use a face lotion and then apply this oil on after. The oil actually absorbs very well into the the skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy for too long. It became a daily routine for my skin now. I am 25 years old, and moisturizing for me is my preventive care for wrinkle skin. It has been a year or longer since I have been using this product. It last quite a long time too. It is something I definitely would continue to use and would recommend to my own family and friends.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t even take away my scars in the slightest. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but I regret buying such a large bottle for a product that does nothing to my skin.</li>
    <li> Using this to avoid pregnancy stretch marks (as much as possible). It has a nice scent and absorbs into the skin quickly, which is nice because I don&#x27;t want to be all oiled up when I go to bed. I even started using it on my face and I really think it is helping my complexion.</li>
    <li> I only used this product for the scratched mark, now I am using it on my face and neck. If you are looking for a product to use over the make-up, I do not recommend this one because it is oil.</li>
    <li> be careful there is fake bio oil going around, i got myself some real bio oil and fake bio oil from amazon. so its a hit or miss depending on who is providing it.</li>
    <li> Bio-Oil has such a great, fresh scent. It works great on scars as well as stretch marks. It reduces itching that sometimes occurs with stretch marks and it seems to help reduced scar visability.</li>
    <li> not great scent, very oily</li>
    <li> I love this product! It may take few months to work but it&#x27;s worth it. Helped lighten my stretch marks and even my old scara.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just entering my second trimester so I won&#x27;t be sure if it works for what I bought it for yet, but it has helped my boyfriends stretch marks on his arm and faded a scar I&#x27;ve had a long time. I am super annoyed that it went on sale two days after I bought it, but that&#x27;s no ones fault.</li>
    <li> This is a life saver! Absolutely zero stretch marks after pregnancy!</li>
    <li> Im happy with my oil, thk!</li>
    <li> Great oil. Using it right now during my pregnancy and helps prevent any stretch marks</li>
    <li> At 31 weeks pregnant my mother gifted me a bottle of Bio Oil to try and help prevent stretch marks. I liked it quite a bit, so I bought a bottle through Amazon. The new bottle had two variations: the color of the oil, which prompted me to check the packaging. There was also a slight variation in the verbiage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My questions sent to the company through their website under the &#x27;contact us&#x27; link were:&lt;br /&gt;Are color variations normal? The color of the new bottle is orange, while the color of my first bottle was pink.&lt;br /&gt;Has Bio Oil changed the verbiage of their packaging? The first bottle read &amp;#34;Specialist moisturizer for&amp;#34; and the new one read &amp;#34;Helps improve the appearance of&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust my mom&#x27;s choice of cosmetics, and if this new package is not authentic I won&#x27;t use it. I ordered before I was out of the sample my mom gave me so I wouldn&#x27;t miss a beat. It&#x27;s been about a week since I tried to contact them, bottle sitting there unopened. Baby growing... 34 weeks, expanding and I&#x27;m just out of the last of the first bottle. Guess I&#x27;ll just return this bottle.</li>
    <li> Light moisturizer and feels great on my skin. My friend used this through her first pregnancy and highly  recommended if you want to avoid stretch marks. I have been using for months because it is so light and keeps my skin really soft. It&#x27;s a little pricing but I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> It is very good,  I like it so much....</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, have been using it for over 2 years. Great for scars but takes time for them to disappear.</li>
    <li> my dermatologist recommended this as a daily serum.  i have combination skin and it soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t make my face too oily.  much cheaper than the really expensive serums, and according to my doctor, it is basically the SAME THING!!!</li>
    <li> PROS: Excellent source of moisture for the skin especially if you live in a region where it is cold this time if year and dries up your skin. My daughter uses it for stretch mark reduction and I have seen that it works.&lt;br /&gt;CON: A little greasy but it works.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. I mix it in with my cetaphil cream. It is greasy at first but soaks in the skin nice after a bit.</li>
    <li> it really work but I don&#x27;t use it everyday so maybe that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t see result right away lol</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any change!</li>
    <li> Love bio oil keeps my skin moistured and helps with the itching... No stretch marks and almost giving birth !!</li>
    <li> I use Bio-Oil everywhere on my body, including my face, and I just watch all of my blemishes disappear. I use it two or three times daily (every time I step out of the shower) and have had amazing results. The key is to be patient. Results will come with time. (My boyfriend uses it as well and has good results.) We&#x27;re both in our early twenties. He&#x27;s mixed (African American and German) and I am African American.... If that helps anyone. :)</li>
    <li> Really good product. Recommended!!!</li>
    <li> i have tried this product twice correctly 2 years ago before i got pregnant i had small red stretch marks on my side and it didnt remove them. i decided to give it a try again now that im pregnant  and it has yet reduced the appearance of any of my new stretchmarks and i continue to get stretch marks as i use this product.  so i say no this product does not work not even after using this for a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;ANDDDDDD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this product isnt  real the first time I purchased this I got this at walmart. The color and smell were completely different. I knew the price was too good to be true. It&#x27;s a shame I started to get stretch marks as soon as i stopped using mamma bees belly bitter because i switched to this product.... i probably wouldn&#x27;t of gotten any stretch marks if I wasn&#x27;t ripped off. Do not buy this product here. Go to a store and get it if you want to try it to make sure your getting the real thing.</li>
    <li> Use this on my neck at night. Pleasant smell. Very hydrating.</li>
    <li> This product is very good! Love it! The smell is ok for me too, not too strong which is good!</li>
    <li> Love using bio oil it leaves my skin so smooth and has definitely helped reduce my stretch marks!</li>
    <li> received the item, good smell and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Not only is this product good for stretch marks but I use it at night doesn&#x27;t make me brake out and my face feels amazing</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Ive been using it to help fade out scaring on my face from acne. I do have oily skin so if i use it too much on my face I&#x27;ll get a few pimples but if I only use it like once a day after washing my face in the morning its much better. Works great on dry skin and to use after a shower. It also did help fade some of my stretch marks. Will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Bought during pregnancy to (try to) prevent stretchmarks, even though I knew nothing prevented stretchmarks. I thought, why not give it a try since I need to moisturize my belly anyway.  I used this religiously and got all greased up after showers.  Still did not prevent stretchmarks.  It did help prevent itchiness as when I didn&#x27;t use it I got pretty itchy.  But then again, during the end of my third trimester, even putting this religiously didn&#x27;t prevent itchiness.  It&#x27;s greasy but, well, it&#x27;s oil.  I didn&#x27;t mind the scent but my husband thought it smelled weird.</li>
    <li> Received quickly.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Love Bio-Oil! It&#x27;s not greasy. Very smooth and helps keep my skin not dry.</li>
    <li> This product perfectly works!&lt;br /&gt;But I have to use more than 3 months to see the result</li>
    <li> The Best Skin Care Product on the Market and the price can&#x27;t be beat for all that it does. Amazing!</li>
    <li> 2nd bottle, no noticeable difference, but i love the way my skin absorbs it and isn&#x27;t oily. love the smell.</li>
    <li> After a few months using on scar from hip replacement, there&#x27;s only a brief reminder of surgery, and that is going away while I use the product on my other hip replacement scar.  I&#x27;m a dedicated fan!!!</li>
    <li> Gets rid of dog bite scars,  at least 80% reduction.</li>
    <li> Only 3 stars right now b/c I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, but I like what I see.  Once I have the baby and continue to use it, I will update later.</li>
    <li> Um, color dyes? I can&#x27;t bear to put this on my skin when artificial colors are involved.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this item. Lightly rosy. I put this over all my body in winter and it seems to keep my skin moist and less crackled.</li>
    <li> bought this for stretch marks...I cannot really tell if it is working or not, haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell.</li>
    <li> made my hair fall out</li>
    <li> Works really well. Two weeks after using it I&#x27;ve started seeing results, I use it for my stretch marks and their appearance have greatly improved!!!</li>
    <li> Does not work. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> I used this while pregnant and still developed stretch marks. Kept using it after I delivered too but it didn&#x27;t help. Not sure what I&#x27;m going to use the rest of it for.</li>
    <li> for people who care about their skin this product is for you</li>
    <li> Good quality product. It was exactly what I was expecting. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this products.  Make my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> Not a single stretchmark and scars are gone. I love this product and the nice scent.</li>
    <li> Except for a good smell, what good is there?  It contains coumarin.  Coumarin is a precursor of coumadin (also known as warfarin), a blood-thinning drug that causes birth defects if a pregnant woman takes it.  Coumarin is absorbed through the skin as well.  There aren&#x27;t any studies on the safety of coumarin during pregnancy.  Also, this so called Bio oil is not Bio enough.  It is mostly mineral oil, which means a petroleum product.  Excuse me, but couldn&#x27;t you guys use a more natural base, such as grape seed oil?  Why put car oil on your skin?  Women out there, I recommend you to seek a more natural alternative.  Just read reviews of many different anti-stretch oils on Amazon and you will realize that almost any plant oil does the job.  People rave about products containing grapeseed oil or jojoba oil.  Based on my research of customer reviews on Amazon, I am going to mix 16 oz grapeseed oil with 4 oz jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> I use this on my body (it doesn&#x27;t work well for my face) and it&#x27;s made my skin noticeably softer, and even helped a little with discoloration on my elbows. I worried it might clog my pores on my legs and cause ingrown hairs after shaving, but it doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t even use it every day (i&#x27;m not so diligent about that stuff), more like 4x a week, but it&#x27;s still made a difference.</li>
    <li> Works great to even skin tone!!</li>
    <li> Do not use on healing wounds! It just makes it worse and dry. But other than that this product works well and is a good alternative to emu oil.</li>
    <li> I thought it would work faster, but am impatient...have been using it only 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Great product! Well-packaged &amp; delivered on time.</li>
