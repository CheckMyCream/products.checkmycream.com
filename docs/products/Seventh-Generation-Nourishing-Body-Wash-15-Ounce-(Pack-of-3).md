      <li>This body wash smells amazing and cleans well, and you know you aren&#x27;t using chemicals or toxins, like triclosan, etc.</li>

      <li>It is worth the purchase for those who want better ingredients with a wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>It kind of has a chemically smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin.</li>

      <li>and I believe people expect more for the nose.  </li>
      <li>Does not have an overwhelming lavender scent</li>
      <li>I love this shower gel.  </li>
      <li>Not horrible</li>
      <li>/&gt;It soothes you after a bath, and for me it makes me feel relaxed, and sometimes sleepy too.. :-)</li>
      <li>Love it and plan to buy it again.</li>
      <li>, they don&#x27;t test on animals! :)</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I love all the products the Seventh Generation has.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant change to my skin -- more smoother texture!</li>
      <li>It lathers well, and does seem to leave skin more moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE 7th Generation and knew I would like this.  </li>
      <li>I feel very clean after using it and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product leaves my skin feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>and I think it smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>It is worth the purchase for those who want better natural ingredients with a wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant lavender scent and it is very concentrated.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice, mild.</li>
      <li>It is so nice to have something that smells great and isn&#x27;t totally loaded with chemicals.</li>
      <li>This product is truly effective at cleansing and moisturizing with no artificial ingredients and has a nice fresh hint of lavender.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m here to tell you that they weren&#x27;t kidding, it really does not smell good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I have finally found a product that is safe and that I can easily find without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>The lavender has such a lovely smell, am happy buying it..</li>
      <li>Hands down the best body wash out there.  </li>
      <li>That said, it cleans fine and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of Seventh Generation from Smiley360</li>
      <li>Overall, great product that I plan on purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>a good idea if you have sensitive</li>
      <li>It smells great and a bottle goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I may BE clean</li>
      <li>The upshot is that I don&#x27;t feel clean after I use it.</li>
      <li>After I shower, my cooter smells like I had sex with Mr. Clean.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I should wash my body with it or clean the shower with it.</li>
      <li>I have tried different organic body wash and this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender - more like industrial grade soap or something.  </li>
      <li>My favorite thing about it is that it really seems to nourish my skin.</li>
      <li>I might try the other varieties, but I&#x27;m happy this purchase</li>
      <li>It ranks low on the EWG skin deep database for toxin levels, which is a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I may just take 2 drops of my own lavender essential oil and spiff it up a bit.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it is all natural.</li>
      <li>We have reorder this item with different aroma and enjoy most of them.</li>
      <li>recommend buying a natural product from a competing brand, even one that costs more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very gentle</li>
      <li>, the price was right, and the body wash certainly does what it&#x27;s supposed to, I won&#x27;t buy this again.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Old, musty garbage pale from a chemistry lab&amp;#34; is more accurate.</li>
      <li>Smell is not as great as other natural body washes I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s very gentle on sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t burn when others do.</li>
      <li>The product comes out pretty fast</li>
      <li>Overall fresh, clean feeling with no drying.  </li>
      <li>My sinuses are very sensitive and the smell does not bother me but its not the fresh scent I had hoped for.</li>
      <li>have not had to use as much lotion because of this either</li>
      <li>I buy this soap regularly and really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>reasonably well&lt;br /&gt;-Fairly priced</li>
      <li>and you have to use a ton of it to get it to really lather - not this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Ever since the initial use we enjoy use this soap for the value and their purpose.</li>
      <li>However, the lavender scent leaves much to be desired.</li>
      <li>, it has been very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other brand smell much better</li>
      <li>The lavender smell is very light and far less than other lavender scented products but it does lather up nicely and is non-irritating.</li>
      <li>Wish this had been a little more hydrating.. .may not be suitable for extra cold days after taking a bath.. .Has nice , clean smell though.</li>
      <li>Initially I got this on a super discount as a trial.</li>
      <li>This is highly fragranced.</li>
      <li>my skin is so soft !!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great lavender scent, and lots of suds !</li>
    <li> Its not Lavender scent. It smells soo bad. Like bathroom cleaning / glass cleaning smell. Urghh so regret I bought 3 when they were on sale.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and so happy with my purchase! Great price too, I love it and use it everyday. I now enjoy my showers and this is also good for soothing the sense&#x27;s at night before bed. It is worth the purchase for those who want better natural ingredients with a wonderful scent. I received a free sample of Seventh Generation from Smiley360</li>
    <li> OMG !!  This Body Wash is the greatest !!  Smells awesome and my skin is so soft !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I have finally found a natural body wash that I can actually afford. This product is rated a 2 on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website on a scale of 0-10 in terms of how dangerous the chemicals are, zero being the safest. I&#x27;m so happy I have finally found a product that is safe and that I can easily find without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For having mostly natural ingredients, I&#x27;m surprised how much this product suds up. I feel very clean after using it and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint is the bottle. The product comes out pretty fast and if you&#x27;re trying to produce as little amount of waste as possible, this can be troublesome because I feel like I wasted quite a bit when I took a shower this morning. Overall, great product that I plan on purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they don&#x27;t test on animals! :)</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin feeling very clean. I love the fact that it is all natural. However, the lavender scent leaves much to be desired. It is VERY strong, and it smells more like a household cleaner than lavender body wash. After I shower, my cooter smells like I had sex with Mr. Clean. I don&#x27;t know if I should wash my body with it or clean the shower with it.</li>
    <li> Watery.&lt;br /&gt;Makes me itch.&lt;br /&gt;Dried my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good idea if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I should have asked for a refund.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, mild. Cleanse well.</li>
    <li> This is highly fragranced. It will sting if you get it in your eyes. I recommend anything from Shea Moisture instead.</li>
    <li> I opened a bottle today and used it to shower. It does not smell anything as I expected. It smells stinky and like some kind of bleach. Anyway it does make my skin feel clean but dry. This may not be for you if you prefer something smells good.</li>
    <li> The main bad review states that it didn&#x27;t smell as expected.  I thought that wasn&#x27;t that bad a review, so I bought it anyway.  I&#x27;m here to tell you that they weren&#x27;t kidding, it really does not smell good.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender - more like industrial grade soap or something.  That said, it cleans fine and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.</li>
    <li> The lavender has such a lovely smell, am happy buying it.. The smell is so natural, and it has a lot of lavender oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;It soothes you after a bath, and for me it makes me feel relaxed, and sometimes sleepy too.. :-)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May have given me a rash. Not sure if I had an allergic reaction to it or something else. But I&#x27;ve never previously had a rash from any body product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to Neutrogena Body Wash</li>
    <li> I decided to try the Seventh Generation Nourishing Body Wash, Lavender (Set of 3), since I&#x27;ve always loved Seventh Generation products. Moreover, I am a nursing mom, so I need to use products that are all natural and chemical-free as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product failed to disappoint! I&#x27;ve noticed a significant change to my skin -- more smoother texture! My skin has been rough since I gave birth last year, and this body wash helps me with the problem so much. I love the lavender smell too! I might try the other varieties, but I&#x27;m happy this purchase overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pocket is uber happy, since this is super affordable! :-)</li>
    <li> This is a good value for the money on Amazon subscribe and save, but you do have to use more of it than a premium brand. The lavender smell is very light and far less than other lavender scented products but it does lather up nicely and is non-irritating.</li>
    <li> I bought the lavender scented and it smelled like bend-gay. Thought I could power through it since I bought a 3 pack, buts it just smells too bad.  RETURNED.</li>
    <li> I love all the products the Seventh Generation has. This body wash smells amazing and cleans well, and you know you aren&#x27;t using chemicals or toxins, like triclosan, etc. I&#x27;m loyal to Seventh Generation - all their products are fantastic and smell great.</li>
    <li> What an excellent body wash that is not drying and cleans great. I also like that it has no residue left behind.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from psoriasis and finding a moisturizing body wash that will not irritate his skin is always a challenge.  This product is truly effective at cleansing and moisturizing with no artificial ingredients and has a nice fresh hint of lavender.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Does not have an overwhelming lavender scent and I believe people expect more for the nose.  A little amount lathers up well on a loofah so a bottle will last for awhile.  Overall fresh, clean feeling with no drying.  But everyone&#x27;s skin type is different.</li>
    <li> Onr of the 3 body washes was less than half full and had been sealed with a piece of masking tape!</li>
    <li> Wish this had been a little more hydrating.. .may not be suitable for extra cold days after taking a bath.. .Has nice , clean smell though.</li>
    <li> Positives:&lt;br /&gt;-Environmentally-friendly product&lt;br /&gt;-Lathers reasonably well&lt;br /&gt;-Fairly priced&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to throw away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;-Very disappointed in the smell, and I&#x27;m not picky. &amp;#34;Lavender&amp;#34; is a stretch. &amp;#34;Old, musty garbage pale from a chemistry lab&amp;#34; is more accurate. My girlfriend threw the other 2 bottles away when I wasn&#x27;t paying attention. Seriously, it&#x27;s bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying a natural product from a competing brand, even one that costs more. You don&#x27;t want to walk around with this stench on you.</li>
    <li> Ok so...., it&#x27;s a body wash. It does that. I have used it several dozen time. It smells nothing like lavender. I don&#x27;t know what the smell is but it is not in the flower family. I would purchase this item again for the good price but would NOT buy the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> While this product has a nice scent, it&#x27;s not that chemical-lavender clying fragrance of a lot of lavender scented products.  It lathers well, and does seem to leave skin more moisturized.  It&#x27;s a great product to use in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance does not last, which can either be a pro or a con.  My husband likes it.</li>
    <li> Scents is so so. Other brand smell much better</li>
    <li> Its fragrance is no way closer to the smell of lavender. It really smells stinky and horrible. I wont recommend it.</li>
    <li> This lathers well, rinses clean but does not even remotely smell like lavender. It smells like boring if boring had a smell. My sinuses are very sensitive and the smell does not bother me but its not the fresh scent I had hoped for. I may just take 2 drops of my own lavender essential oil and spiff it up a bit. All in all, 3 bottles of this kind of body wash for under $11 with the coupon I saw is still a very good deal. Just don&#x27;t expect it to smell like lavender. At all.</li>
    <li> I try to use products that are natural and not tested on animals so I thought I&#x27;d try this at home and at the gym. Love it and plan to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smell is artificial and lather is ok. Not horrible but won&#x27;t buy again.  Got a good deal on this purchase but now I have an abundance of a blah product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash in the shower with exfoliating gloves for 3 months now.  A penny-sized squeeze produces enough lather to soap up neck to toe.  It gets the job done and cleanses without drying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who uses pure lavender essential oil on a regular basis, this does not smell like straight lavender as I expected.  After realizing so, I checked the list of ingredients and the label says: \\&quot;essential oils and botanical extracts (lavandin, lavender, eucalyptus globulus, pine)\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I like Seventh Generation products, the price was right, and the body wash certainly does what it&#x27;s supposed to, I won&#x27;t buy this again.  I&#x27;ll opt for a solid organic bar of another brand.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and so happy with my purchase!  Great price too, I love it and use it everyday.  It is worth the purchase for those who want better ingredients with a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> I bought the Lavender scent and I think it smells pretty good. My favorite thing about it is that it really seems to nourish my skin. (At least a heck of a lot better than any other washes I&#x27;ve tried) I have very dry skin and this stuff helps prevent all the dry itchiness I usually get. Plus I like that it has a whole lot of natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This left my skin dry and itchy. I didn&#x27;t even like it in my kitchen soft soap container. Smells okay. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Smell is not as great as other natural body washes I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s very gentle on sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t burn when others do. It doesn&#x27;t actually smell like lavender - if it did I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. It kind of has a chemically smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin.</li>
    <li> Only complaint I have on this item is the price...&lt;br /&gt;But I am not reviewing the price just the product.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good product I did not believe it until i tried it, it does not leave you itchy&lt;br /&gt;after you use it like other harsh drying body wash&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;I have not had to use as much lotion because of this either, it has been very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it if you can afford it! :)</li>
    <li> I buy this soap regularly and really enjoy it. It ranks low on the EWG skin deep database for toxin levels, which is a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the lavender scent to the others, but I&#x27;ve tried them all and they all smell good.</li>
    <li> Initially I got this on a super discount as a trial. Ever since the initial use we enjoy use this soap for the value and their purpose. We have reorder this item with different aroma and enjoy most of them. In my opinion for the price and the environmental purpose it is definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I love this shower gel.  It is so nice to have something that smells great and isn&#x27;t totally loaded with chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never heard of this brand before I purchased this but my wife had so I decided to try it out.  This exceeded my expectations.  It has a pleasant lavender scent and it is very concentrated.  I made the mistake of thinking this body wash is like the typical body wash and you have to use a ton of it to get it to really lather - not this stuff.  One drop of this goes a long way.  It&#x27;s also very gentle so we use it on our infant son.  I plan on purchasing this brand again.</li>
    <li> This costs seven dollars and nineteen cents on Amazon for each individual bottle of the same product, same size. So by buying this in bulk, it seems like you&#x27;re saving money when you&#x27;re really not!</li>
    <li> Only thing &amp;#34;lavender&#x27; about this product is the writing on the front of the bottle.  No ingredients contain the word &amp;#34;Lavender&amp;#34;, there is no lavender scent.</li>
    <li> my children say it is great smelling and works well</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It smells great, leaves my skin clean and hydrated and is made by a company that we know and trust.</li>
    <li> I was able to get a steal on the price for this, otherwise I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.  I LOVE 7th Generation and knew I would like this.  It smells great!  I usually buy the 365 lavender wash from Whole Foods, but noticed the scent goes away after a while - at least that&#x27;s what happened to my latest bottle.  The 7th generation body wash lathers up well &amp; the scent has lasted so far!</li>
    <li> This product has a medical smell.  The initial scent is not a strong lavender.  The three pack is a great deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a subscribe and save item because I&#x27;ve been trying to use fewer chemicals in my life.  This stuff works like any body wash (lathers well, but it has sulfates in it for that purpose FYI), but it smells completely terrible. A few people have said in their reviews that it smells like drain cleaner. This is not far off. The masking scent is nonexistent and it smells like I&#x27;m lathering myself in plastic or something. It&#x27;s really gross. The upshot is that I don&#x27;t feel clean after I use it. I may BE clean but I feel gross because of having to smell this stuff for my whole shower.  Now I have 3 bottles of this stuff I don&#x27;t want to use.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best body wash out there.  I have tried different organic body wash and this is by far the best.  It smells great and a bottle goes a long way.  Love it.</li>
