### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is the best one I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
      <li>-- this provides the perfect amount.  </li>
      <li>This works great!  </li>
      <li>However, after using it both with and without an eyebrow liner, I now greatly prefer it to the colored gels!  </li>
      <li>The wand is awesome.  </li>
      <li>It works incredibly well, since just like this gel</li>
      <li>Also a great price.</li>
      <li>Great idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product-- will continue to buy and use.</li>
      <li>I think this product would be a great way to surreptitiously bring some of those hairs under control.</li>
      <li>For this purpose, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>Brow Drama is great for wilder brows.</li>
      <li>so it wasn’t very effective.</li>
      <li>They look thicker, more defined, and best of all the stray hairs stay in place!</li>
      <li>Great product at a fair price.</li>
      <li>My eyebrows are really fair.</li>
      <li>Good product for keeping the brows in place and looking maintained.</li>
      <li>I just apply with a separate brush and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
      <li>Good Stuff</li>
      <li>In my younger years, they were almost perfect &amp; even had  a perfect shape.</li>
      <li>This product however is a nice trade off.</li>
      <li>For me, my brow hairs have a mind of their own growing in whatever way</li>
      <li>For years, I have been styling my eyebrows with my own creation - an aloe gel, which I use as eye brow setter and then finish with my fingers and an end of a comb.  </li>
      <li>it smooths my brows but not as nicely as I want it</li>
      <li>and I really liked it.</li>
      <li>Great product to have to maintain brows and achieve a clean sculpted look.</li>
      <li>What a great name for a useful product.  </li>
      <li>I have very light brown eyebrows</li>
      <li>I have tinted eyebrow gel products that I use all of the time and that work much better than this one.  </li>
      <li>I love the commercials for it</li>
      <li>It reminds me a lot of Givenchy Phenomen&#x27;Eyes Mascara, which I also absolutely love.  </li>
      <li>but now i love</li>
      <li>but this is so much better.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this eye gel.</li>
      <li>so it gave my brows a healthy look.</li>
      <li>like most people do.</li>
      <li>She wouldn’t buy it again but may try the colored one to see if it was any better.</li>
      <li>The picture and description is misleading, but that&#x27;s ok because i had no idea what to expect.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you buy transparent rather than any shades.</li>
      <li>I love the  look over a lightest taupe eyebrow pencil I can find.</li>
      <li>I think that for me this product is just ok.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I thought it was ok</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>It looks like there&#x27;s powder on top of your brows or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The end result is a more polished and put together you.</li>
      <li>...because of this it is merely an ok product for me.  </li>
      <li>On occasion I will clean them up with a nice snip here or there, but every day I just brush them in place.</li>
      <li>Nice tool to have on hand for a quick touch up.</li>
      <li>Gel goes on transparent and feels cool and refreshing and makes the brows look more sculpted and defined.</li>
      <li>I tried Maybeline New York Eye Studio Brow Drama and the product is as good or better than the others I have used.</li>
      <li>It is very attractively priced, compared to almost every other product.</li>
      <li>brow mousse is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I inherited many wonderful things from my family, but the Italian eyebrows I really could do without.  </li>
      <li>, it is perfect for me because my brows are dark.</li>
      <li>And while this particular color (transparent) may not be the perfect for everyone (because the gel is clear</li>
      <li>Accordingly, I think this product is best suited for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to change the color of their brows and is happy with their fullness and just wants a product to help subtly shape them.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;d buy this again, as the brush was my favorite by far, so much better than my fingers and a comb!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s listed &amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34; in color, which is accurate.</li>
      <li>The unruly hairs are now in alignment and look smooth</li>
      <li>Personally I think it is a great touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>using Maybelline Gel Mousse, make sure to get a good amount of gel on your brush, for me, sometimes when I dipped the brush in, i didn&#x27;t get enough.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;In summary, if you don&#x27;t need a tinted brow gel, this gel is high quality and the wand shape is amazing for application.</li>
      <li>Brow Drama is great to keep them all in place--all day long.</li>
      <li>When I first took the wand out I wasn&#x27;t even sure there was anything on it</li>
      <li>it works great in either the left or right hand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel with an amazing brush.  </li>
      <li>After a swipe or two, the brows are good to go and actually seem to obey.</li>
      <li>I liked that it wasn&#x27;t sticky and the gel was clear</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately for my needs, this wasn&#x27;t quite the right product as my eyebrows are so light</li>
      <li>I prefer just the gel because I can swipe it on quickly and go.&lt;br</li>
      <li>for such a drama name this gel actually does an excellent job at holding the eyebrow hairs in place.  </li>
      <li>Very buildable and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>they like (aging is so much fun...)</li>
      <li>Wow, this stuff is fantastic!</li>
      <li>ball is handy for errant specific hairs.</li>
      <li>I rarely had to pluck any stray hairs.</li>
      <li>I like that the clear gel won&#x27;t get accidentally rubbed off and smear, and this is just more for keeping your brows in line.</li>
      <li>Aside from that I am pleased in general and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
      <li>The ball on the end is great for attacking stray hairs and small areas.  </li>
      <li>This is a great everyday solution to speedy defining of eyebrows!  </li>
      <li>I have tried a couple of different brands of brow gel and this one is far superior.  </li>
      <li>However, I could see this being amazing for someone who already has dark full brows.  </li>
      <li>I also have brow pencils and Anastasia Beverly Hills Beauty Express for Brows and Eyes, but using these is more involved so for more everyday wear</li>
      <li>When I first heard about it I thought that there was no way I would ever use eye brow mascara.</li>
      <li>I ended up using first my cake powder to define my brows</li>
      <li>I get it that eyebrow grooming isn&#x27;t necessarily something most men consider, but sometimes a man&#x27;s unruly eyebrows can distract from his appearance.  </li>
      <li>I guess mascara does the same thing to lashes, but on lashes it looks normal for them to be kind of matte...</li>
      <li>I think I quite possibly like it better than the wand for my Anastasia Brow Gel.  </li>
      <li>And this is MUCH easier to use!</li>
      <li>The hunt is real!</li>
      <li>Provides a natural finish and is comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>have pretty nice eyebrows naturally but need a bit of staying power to make them last all day</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do, simply brush along your natural brow line, and you are as good as new.</li>
      <li>Tinted Brow Gel in Caramel (a warm golden light brown that makes them slightly darker than my blonde hair).  </li>
      <li>I usually apply a good amount of brow powder to make them pop.</li>
      <li>Next time I will get the tinted one because I&#x27;m older and I will have more than my one gray brow hair to deal with.</li>
      <li>This is great for pasting them back down again, as well as keeping the direction going upward.</li>
      <li>Tii&#x27;ve been using Maybelline New York Great Lash Clear Mascara for Lash and Brow  to tame my unruly eyebrows</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This takes some effort to lay down enough product, in refreshing change to other brow gels. The ball shape helps get to individual problem brows, though. My brows are a bit wiry, and after being trimmed a bit, tend to want to stand out from my face. This is great for pasting them back down again, as well as keeping the direction going upward. It is very attractively priced, compared to almost every other product. I am going to try the tinted version to see if it works to cover my white brows. The Benefit Gimme Brow doesn&#x27;t stay on well.</li>
    <li> The picture and description is misleading, but that&#x27;s ok because i had no idea what to expect. First, i thought it was going to be like mascara and be tinted black or brown or something, it was neither.  In the picture the brush is a dark color, which further made me believe it to be tinted. The brush is actually white and the gel is clear. Once i got over that confusion, i was ready to try it out. A couple swipes of this across my eyebrows and it got them to flow in the direction of the curve of my eyebrow. There were still a couple hairs that didn&#x27;t do it. The hold of the gel isn&#x27;t super strong, but this is probably a good thing so they don&#x27;t look fake and start clumping possibly. It has a medium to soft hold to where you can touch your eyebrow and not really feel it on them, but they look barely, only if you&#x27;re really looking wet. I like that the clear gel won&#x27;t get accidentally rubbed off and smear, and this is just more for keeping your brows in line. If you&#x27;re looking for something incognito to keep your brows under control, this would be it</li>
    <li> mistake in description.  did not receive what I expected.</li>
    <li> Brow Drama is great for wilder brows. I often trim my brows because the individual hairs seem long and crazy if I don&#x27;t keep on top of them. Brow Drama is great to keep them all in place--all day long. It isn&#x27;t flaky or heavy like regular mascara can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ball is handy for errant specific hairs. Next time I will get the tinted one because I&#x27;m older and I will have more than my one gray brow hair to deal with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one type or another clear, eyebrow mascara for years. I love the  look over a lightest taupe eyebrow pencil I can find. It really makes for natural looking brows. The pencil should be a shade or three lighter than your natural brows and the gel over deepens it just a little. I tried Maybeline New York Eye Studio Brow Drama and the product is as good or better than the others I have used. It dries fast and soft. The one thing I haven&#x27;t understood is the brush. I suppose it&#x27;s meant for precision but I find it awkward. I just apply with a separate brush and I&#x27;m good to go. I like this and it&#x27;s actually a little less expensive on Amazon than I find locally. Good Stuff</li>
    <li> I like the applicator, but the gel itself is not impressive. It is not substantial enough and doesn&#x27;t seem to cling to the applicator or the eyebrow hairs. I&#x27;ve used other clear eyebrow gels that worked much better (i.e. Anastasia eyebrow gel). I used the applicator with my Lancome eyebrow gel and I really liked it. I wish this applicator came with that gel or visa versa.</li>
    <li> Brow Drama: What a great name for a useful product.  I&#x27;m sure the intent was to focus on making one&#x27;s eyebrows dramatic.  For me, my brow hairs have a mind of their own growing in whatever way they like (aging is so much fun...) and this product stops that drama.  The unruly hairs are now in alignment and look smooth and, well, normal.  My thinning brows also look a little thicker now that they are lined up better.    It has a slight chemical smell when you first pull the brush out of the bottle, but there is no lingering smell. It&#x27;s transparent, so it tames your brows without adding color. If you choose, you can use a brow pencil to add color.  The gel goes on soft, not sticky or glue-like.  I had no sensitivity or reaction to the product.    I also think men who would benefit from this product.  I get it that eyebrow grooming isn&#x27;t necessarily something most men consider, but sometimes a man&#x27;s unruly eyebrows can distract from his appearance.  I think this product would be a great way to surreptitiously bring some of those hairs under control. No one will know the secret.  Just make sure you buy transparent rather than any shades. I think Maybelline should consider repackaging the product and placing it in the men&#x27;s grooming aisle of the pharmacy.      Great product-- will continue to buy and use.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t do much with my brows with the exception of brushing them lightly to tame them. On occasion I will clean them up with a nice snip here or there, but every day I just brush them in place. This product however is a nice trade off. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do, simply brush along your natural brow line, and you are as good as new. The small brush that it comes with is easy to handle. So you don&#x27;t put a ton on. It doesn&#x27;t appear to stain, smear or clump. It also didn&#x27;t make my brows look hard or stiff. The end result is a more polished and put together you. And while this particular color (transparent) may not be the perfect for everyone (because the gel is clear but I do think it comes in other colors, like brown or black), it is perfect for me because my brows are dark. It merely enhanced what I already have. Over all, it&#x27;s a small investment for a nice little tool that makes any makeup bag complete. 4.5 stars</li>
    <li> The Maybeline New York Eyestudio Brow Gel has really helped to train my eyebrows and lay all of the crazy hairs down. I am hooked. I love it</li>
    <li> This works great!  I am a senior gal whose thick, natural curved eyebrows have thinned out and now get a bit straggly here and there so I have been spending a lot of money from a shopping network for a combination tube with the eyebrow tint on one end and the gel on the other end. It just gets yucky after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using an eyebrow pencil in the taupe shade followed by the Maybelline New York Eyestudio Brow Drama in Transparent and get the same effect and less than a quarter of the cost I originally was paying for the combination tube.  And this is MUCH easier to use! LOVE the little brush - so much easier and effective to use than a regular long shaped brush.  Great idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will keep purchasing this product!</li>
    <li> I had never used a brow mascara before using this transparent brow sculpting mascara.  I really do like it, it keeps your brows together and is clear so no color is added.  I normally have to use my fingers to keep mine in place some times, or I would use lotion.  This brow mascara works well, I am tempted to try one that is tinted.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple of different brands of brow gel and this one is far superior.  It holds your brows in place without being overly goopy or sticky.  I have a few unruly brow hairs and this does hold it in place.  I would like to try the tinted browgel to see what the difference is!</li>
    <li> Tii&#x27;ve been using Maybelline New York Great Lash Clear Mascara for Lash and Brow  to tame my unruly eyebrows but this is so much better. iThe brush was a little strange the first time i used it but now i love it- it works great in either the left or right hand. The gel holds the longer stray hairs in place and doesn&#x27;t flake off. The clear is grat and I plan to try the tinted ones next. Great product at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I really like this gel for the eyebrows. I got the clear, transparent one. The instructions say to apply it in short upward strokes. I applied it as instructed and found, when it was dry, that my eyebrows did not look obvious, but were well-groomed and had a more clean arch. I gave it four stars because I didn&#x27;t feel it made enough of a difference for me to take the extra time each day to apply, but if you need to tame your eyebrows, this would be a good product to use.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is fantastic! When I first heard about it I thought that there was no way I would ever use eye brow mascara. I could not imagine ever wanting to put the same thickening formula I use on my lashes on my eyebrows. And then I read the previous reviews and I knew I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;My eye brows have definitely thinned out over the years and I have a few eyebrow hairs over my left eye that always seem to want to point downward no matter what I do. It drives me crazy! I was so shocked and amazed at how well this stuff works! When I first took the wand out I wasn&#x27;t even sure there was anything on it, that&#x27;s how transparent and thin the product is. I swiped it over both my eyebrows as instructed on the packaging and they were instantly transformed. They look thicker, more defined, and best of all the stray hairs stay in place! I walked out of the bathroom and my daughter immediately said &amp;#34;you look different!&amp;#34;. My husband was also amazed and wondered if it might work on his eyebrows to keep some crazy hairs in place. This is definitely a must have product in my home from now on!</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are really fair. I usually apply a good amount of brow powder to make them pop. I absolutely love this eye gel. I just sweep it across my brows and it dries almost instantly. The hairs stay in place and look vibrant without looking fake or sticky. It lasts all day, even through an intense workout in the gym. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday solution to speedy defining of eyebrows!  I have used clear mascara on my blonde brows before, but this brush is MUCH better and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty nice eyebrows naturally but need a bit of staying power to make them last all day -- this provides the perfect amount.  This comes in several colors, I got the clear and like it very much.  If I am doing smokey eyes I add a bit of light blonde brow pencil and sweep this over to keep everything in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying another one of these when this tube runs out.</li>
    <li> I inherited many wonderful things from my family, but the Italian eyebrows I really could do without.  Despite all manner of plucking and coaxing, I still catch them going awry at times.  With this, they stay put.  It&#x27;s a clear gel with an amazing brush.  After a swipe or two, the brows are good to go and actually seem to obey. The gel isn&#x27;t sticky or goey, and apart from brows that look presentable, you can&#x27;t see the gel.  My skin tends to be on the sensitive side, and I&#x27;ve had no issue with itching or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have dark, thick eyebrows and have used brow gel for years. Ulta makes one but half the time the stores are out. Lately I&#x27;ve been using the clear Great Lash but the brush puts too much on and it gets flaky when dry. . This product is the best one I have ever used. The round brush applies the perfect amount, there&#x27;s no globs or thick spots. And it dries clear with no flaking. I love it.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my wife and she tried it out for me. She gave it a less than favorable review. Stating that the brush is nice for straightening out brown hairs, but she said that there wasn’t enough product that actually got onto the brush so it wasn’t very effective. She wouldn’t buy it again but may try the colored one to see if it was any better. She said you’re better off using a little hairspray on a brow brush for hold.</li>
    <li> I was curious to try this because I love eyebrow gel.  Usually I use Anastasia Beverly Hills Tinted Brow Gel in Caramel (a warm golden light brown that makes them slightly darker than my blonde hair).  I also have brow pencils and Anastasia Beverly Hills Beauty Express for Brows and Eyes, but using these is more involved so for more everyday wear I prefer just the gel because I can swipe it on quickly and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, as other people have pointed out, the product description here is confusing.  I didn&#x27;t notice &#x27;tinted&#x27; being referenced at all on the packaging and the gel is in fact transparent.  Meaning, it isn&#x27;t going to darken or add any additional color to your brows.  Accordingly, I think this product is best suited for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to change the color of their brows and is happy with their fullness and just wants a product to help subtly shape them.  For this purpose, it&#x27;s great.  The wand is awesome.  I think I quite possibly like it better than the wand for my Anastasia Brow Gel.  The ball on the end is great for attacking stray hairs and small areas.  It reminds me a lot of Givenchy Phenomen&#x27;Eyes Mascara, which I also absolutely love.  It&#x27;s not the EXACT same type of wand, but it definitely reminded me of what I love about the shape of the Givenchy Phenomen&#x27;Eyes Mascara wand tip.  Personally I think it is a great touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for my needs, this wasn&#x27;t quite the right product as my eyebrows are so light I need the tint to properly pop.  However, I could see this being amazing for someone who already has dark full brows.  That said, I do like it layered over brow pencils and powders to hold actual hairs in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you don&#x27;t need a tinted brow gel, this gel is high quality and the wand shape is amazing for application.</li>
    <li> Great product to have to maintain brows and achieve a clean sculpted look. Gel goes on transparent and feels cool and refreshing and makes the brows look more sculpted and defined. To use just brush onto the eyebrows in light upward strokes, following along the brow contour. For a more dramatic look you can use brow drama tinted gel mouse. Good product for keeping the brows in place and looking maintained. Provides a natural finish and is comfortable to wear. Nice tool to have on hand for a quick touch up.</li>
    <li> Tinted? It&#x27;s listed &amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34; in color, which is accurate. This is simple brow gel, nothing fancy. It doesn&#x27;t clump or become sticky, I can use it under or over my powder/pencil without smearing. The ball brush is way easier than the other types of wands I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-effective&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-stays put&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t mess up existing eyebrow makeup.</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair (and eyebrows), so at least in pictures, I look as though I have NO eyebrows.  They are annoyingly unruly, too, so I am always looking for methods with which to &#x27;tame&#x27; them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this, I was using a Revlon eye pencil/gel combo, which comes in a blonde color.  However, there were two problems with that product: it always ran out of gel before liner (not a big deal, at least I could still use the liner), and the liner became impossible to sharpen once it got about halfway down, because of the design and how it is attached to the mascara-like gel end.  That was a big waste of product!  So now I prefer to have an eyebrow liner and grooming gel as two separate products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often use JUST a grooming gel and skip the brow pencil, for everyday makeup.  Inititally, I was disappointed that although this product is called &#x27;tinted,&#x27; it comes in &#x27;transparent,&#x27; which is what &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; I got.  However, after using it both with and without an eyebrow liner, I now greatly prefer it to the colored gels!  The reason is that pretty much every tinted colored gel I&#x27;ve tried ends up looking kind of dull...no sheen like your eyebrows would normally have.  They look dirty, basically...I guess mascara does the same thing to lashes, but on lashes it looks normal for them to be kind of matte...on brows matte looks weird.  It looks like there&#x27;s powder on top of your brows or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the transparent because if you sweat or pull a hat down over your brows, there isn&#x27;t any color to smear onto your skin.  And now I can use any eyebrow pencil UNDER it, and not &amp;#34;overdo&amp;#34; the brow color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the shape of the applicator, too -- it&#x27;s short enough that it works on all parts of your brow -- traditional mascara-type applicators end up putting a lot of product onto your skin where your brow gets thin at the end.  Plus, you can use this in any direction and it dispenses product consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a hit.  I like this brow grooming gel  a lot, and I like it transparent!  Also a great price.</li>
    <li> Maybelline New York Eyestudio Brow Drama Transparent Gel Mousse - for such a drama name this gel actually does an excellent job at holding the eyebrow hairs in place.  I have very dark, bushy and unruly eyebrow hairs.  It&#x27;s odd, because my hair is dirty blonde naturally, and thin.  I pluck and trim, then style my eyebrows.  For years, I have been styling my eyebrows with my own creation - an aloe gel, which I use as eye brow setter and then finish with my fingers and an end of a comb.  It works incredibly well, since just like this gel, it&#x27;s transparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using Maybelline Gel Mousse, make sure to get a good amount of gel on your brush, for me, sometimes when I dipped the brush in, i didn&#x27;t get enough.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d buy this again, as the brush was my favorite by far, so much better than my fingers and a comb!</li>
    <li> Perhaps I don&#x27;t understand the concept?  My product says &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; but my product is definitely clear.  I think that for me this product is just ok.  I have tinted eyebrow gel products that I use all of the time and that work much better than this one.  When I apply it...it smooths my brows but not as nicely as I want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...because of this it is merely an ok product for me.  I love the commercials for it and I have wanted to try it but I don&#x27;t like this clear one.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Gives you natural looking, defined eyebrows with just a few swipes of the wand. Very buildable and easy to apply. I don&#x27;t mind the giant bushy ball at the end like most people do.</li>
    <li> I have strawberry blonde eyebrows.  In my younger years, they were almost perfect &amp; even had  a perfect shape. I rarely had to pluck any stray hairs. Now that I&#x27;ve gotten older a few white, unruly hairs are mixed in. I usually scissor cut those unruly hairs &amp; was hoping that this brow mousse would tame them, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brow mousse is easy to use.  It goes on clear/transparent &amp; my eyebrows remain shiny. I like the brush too, but I&#x27;m disappointed, it doesn&#x27;t tame those unruly hairs.</li>
    <li> The product I received was not tinted, it was actually clear. I have very light brown eyebrows and I appreciate the tinted products that help shape and define my brows.  I ended up using first my cake powder to define my brows and then I applied the clear gel across the eye brows.  They left them feeling natural, like I had nothing on them after the product fully dried.  I thought it was ok, I would not purchase this particular transparent gel in the future..</li>
    <li> I am always looking for brow grooming products. The hunt is real! I was pleasantly surprised at this brow gel because it gave my brows a bit of definition. I liked that it wasn&#x27;t sticky and the gel was clear so it gave my brows a healthy look. Most gel tints are colored and give you a fake dramatic look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side for me is that I had to reapply after about 4 hours. I work 10 hour days in an office and I was a bit annoyed about having to reapply. Aside from that I am pleased in general and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
