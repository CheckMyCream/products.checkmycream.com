      <li>Regardless, this is not the fault of the oil and should not be held against a good oil at a good price.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews, very convincing, applied it on my face and neck twice a day...</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product will buy again.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>If you have fine hair, it would be great to use before using heat appliances.</li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s also effective.  </li>
      <li>It is a great all body oil and it has a mild non intrusive ordor.  </li>
      <li>I had another argan nut oil i liked better, because it didnt smell rotten.  </li>
      <li>had leaked most of the contents into the bag it was in inside its box.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>But it deserve a better packaging.</li>
      <li>I received an Argan oil sampler from Sephora (Josie Maran) and was floored by the amazingly moisturizing, light oil.</li>
      <li>But at $90 for 4 oz, I needed a more cost-effective alternative.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy this and use it for many years to come.</li>
      <li>Customer service was really prompt, friendly, and great though and they sent me two 4 ounce bottles and those did not leak.  </li>
      <li>I use in on my face and body and have found that my skin is weathering the Santa Ana winds more smoothly than without the oil.  </li>
      <li>My skin has a healthy glow and what&#x27;s more it is really reducing the wrinkles! !</li>
      <li>and there are cheap solutions out there to keep the pump in place.</li>
      <li>Feel supple and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my dry skin, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>I also put a drop in my leave-in conditioner and it&#x27;s amazing how soft and manageable it will leave my hair.  </li>
      <li>BUT, seller should really consider putting more effort into securing the packaging.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thicker than Josie Maran&#x27;s, so it doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly, and it smells both nutty and like olives.</li>
      <li>I also use it in my hair if I  want just a quick surface shine.</li>
      <li>I will try some different brands, but I won&#x27;t hesitate to go back to this one if it&#x27;s the best option in terms of effectiveness and value.</li>
      <li>I did order this oil after much reading and with certain amount of doubt, but I&#x27;m please to say that I simply love it now.</li>
      <li>This is not a cheap product, and it&#x27;s a great one too.</li>
      <li>I started with the one once size but soon realized that 8oz was a better buy and thus far better for my skin overall.  </li>
      <li>I had an issue with previous shipment contacted the suppliers even though it was no fault of their own they quickly rectified the situation.</li>
      <li>Love this Argan oil, for several years I bought Argan oil from a home shopping network paying a lot more for a smaller supply.</li>
      <li>It really shows its worth in the hair.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
      <li>Does not irritate, isn&#x27;t overly greasy, but does it ever leave the skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>It is great for taking off makeup, just put a little on washcloth, add a little hot water, &amp; eye makeup comes off so easily.</li>
      <li>But if it does leak, well, I can certainly return it and</li>
      <li>I really like this oil...</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really linger.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>perhaps I have used too much.</li>
      <li>The argon oil really penetrates the hair and does not leave it feeling greasy</li>
      <li>&quot; so you really do get 100% of the product you&#x27;re paying for.  </li>
      <li>i did a lot of searching for argan oil and this was very well priced.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, but not heavy enough for my course wiry hair.</li>
      <li>This oil is just as good, if not better!</li>
      <li>Now I just use argan oil pure as a day and night lotion, nothing more and nothing less</li>
      <li>I purchased the 8oz natural smell, which doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to me, but the little scent there is is not bad.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My hair is a bit too fine to use as a styling product, it ends up looking wet or greasy...</li>
      <li>the product sealed in the clear plastic bag, there is oil everywhere in the bag.</li>
      <li>my old lady hair is as it was when I was in my 20s.</li>
      <li>This is the second time I am buying this product and it came with a real surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I use it in my conditioner (naturally curly hair) on my skin directly,under my moisturizer</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I love this product, and all that with just a few drops a day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also added it to my hair care, and general skin care concoctions.</li>
      <li>I live in the northeast and use this in the winter when my skin is very dry.</li>
      <li>It is completely foreseeable to the seller that the pump may get loose during shipping and will start to dispense oil.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this stuff, it is the best. This oil soaks into the skin like silk. You only need a little bit for either your face, hair, cuticles, elbows, anywhere you are dry. I think it also helps with wrinkles! This one lasts forever, and it has no odor or other chemicals, like others do. I would recommend this to everyone, even men who have dry faces, or hair.  They won&#x27;t mind, since it isn&#x27;t greasy. It is great for taking off makeup, just put a little on washcloth, add a little hot water, &amp; eye makeup comes off so easily. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for my hair.  The argon oil really penetrates the hair and does not leave it feeling greasy</li>
    <li> I use this product in conjunction with Organix Moroccan Oil products as a pre-conditioner before washing my hair and a small amount before drying my hair.  It leaves a wonderful sheen to the hair and reasonable softness.</li>
    <li> I did order this oil after much reading and with certain amount of doubt, but I&#x27;m please to say that I simply love it now. It is an excellent nourishment for skin and scalp and has improved my hair quality in just a week! Will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> I have used it mixed into my moisturizer or lotion and alone.  Does not leave oily feeling and seems to reduce the dryness of my skin.  I have had a number of minor cuts, scrapes and skin issues to which I applied the oil only.  Seems to help with healing.  I think this is something everyone should have.  It only takes a couple of drops for each use.</li>
    <li> This Oil is a life saver!!  My friend told me about it and I use it in my conditioner (naturally curly hair) on my skin directly,under my moisturizer it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> I started with the one once size but soon realized that 8oz was a better buy and thus far better for my skin overall.  I use in on my face and body and have found that my skin is weathering the Santa Ana winds more smoothly than without the oil.  Be careful about mixing it with creams, however.  I used it on my eyes and then put on Yes to Blueberries brightening eye roller and had a lousy reaction; the skin all around my eyes was red for most of the day.  Now, I&#x27;m an allergic person so others may not need to heed this warning but just in case; mix with caution.  Regardless, this is not the fault of the oil and should not be held against a good oil at a good price.</li>
    <li> I received an Argan oil sampler from Sephora (Josie Maran) and was floored by the amazingly moisturizing, light oil. But at $90 for 4 oz, I needed a more cost-effective alternative. Enter WattsBeauty Argan oil.  I&#x27;ve been using this on my dry skin, and it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s thicker than Josie Maran&#x27;s, so it doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly, and it smells both nutty and like olives. Not very pleasant, but not offensive and it doesn&#x27;t really linger. So I do prefer the Josie Maran, but at that price, I&#x27;ll sacrifice the texture and smell.  I will try some different brands, but I won&#x27;t hesitate to go back to this one if it&#x27;s the best option in terms of effectiveness and value.</li>
    <li> I used these for a while, and didn&#x27;t like the smell.  I had another argan nut oil i liked better, because it didnt smell rotten.  I thought it was perfumed, but i just read the bottle and discovered that it was 100% organic, nothing else added.  Simply put, I then did a smell comparison and realized the argan oil i got from Watts had been rancid from day one!</li>
    <li> Love this Argan oil, for several years I bought Argan oil from a home shopping network paying a lot more for a smaller supply. This oil is just as good, if not better!</li>
    <li> i did a lot of searching for argan oil and this was very well priced.  I bought eight ounces and when it came the bottle had leaked most of the contents into the bag it was in inside its box.  Customer service was really prompt, friendly, and great though and they sent me two 4 ounce bottles and those did not leak.  i used the argan oil in homemade body balms, lip balms, and face and body creams because my skin suffers in Colorado&#x27;s extremely dry climate and it&#x27;s healed everything so well!  You can use the oil by itself though on your face and hair and skin and it&#x27;s also effective.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and use to use expensive brand day and night creme till I found Watts Argan oil. Now I just use argan oil pure as a day and night lotion, nothing more and nothing less and my skin looks great! It has stopped all the redness and irritations. My skin has a healthy glow and what&#x27;s more it is really reducing the wrinkles! ! Can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I love this product, and all that with just a few drops a day.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil...I use is often now that it is winter.  It is a great all body oil and it has a mild non intrusive ordor.  I also use it in my hair if I  want just a quick surface shine.</li>
    <li> I will be giving this to my girlfriends as gifts . Nice feel to your hair! I could win friend of the year. haha</li>
    <li> This is the second time I am buying this product and it came with a real surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the product sealed in the clear plastic bag, there is oil everywhere in the bag. the manual in the bag is completely soaked and there is a substantial amount wasted. ( I will upload a picture show how bad it is) This is not a cheap product, and it&#x27;s a great one too. But it deserve a better packaging. It is completely foreseeable to the seller that the pump may get loose during shipping and will start to dispense oil. and there are cheap solutions out there to keep the pump in place. But seller choose to leave it like that and let customers take the chance. If it doesn&#x27;t leak, great! But if it does leak, well, I can certainly return it and too bad it&#x27;s my time that got wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it since I can&#x27;t exchange, and I will still purchase this product again because it&#x27;s a really good product. BUT, seller should really consider putting more effort into securing the packaging.</li>
    <li> I use this Argan oil on my skin and hair, even my face. It absorbs well into the skin. My hair is a bit too fine to use as a styling product, it ends up looking wet or greasy...perhaps I have used too much. I do like to use it at night and it has kept the flyaways in check during the day. I purchased the 8oz natural smell, which doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to me, but the little scent there is is not bad.</li>
    <li> A little drop the size of pea is sufficient to soften the skin on your entire face.  Does not irritate, isn&#x27;t overly greasy, but does it ever leave the skin soft and smooth.  I also put a drop in my leave-in conditioner and it&#x27;s amazing how soft and manageable it will leave my hair.  The 8 oz pump is the best value AND it does not contain any \\&quot;fillers\\&quot; so you really do get 100% of the product you&#x27;re paying for.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Use after every bath and shower, over my legs, heels, elbows, neck and shoulders.  Feel supple and smooth.  No more roughness.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I use it every night as a moisturizer and it beats paying $75+ for creams that run out in no time.  I will continue to buy this and use it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the big deal is about this product? I read the reviews, very convincing, applied it on my face and neck twice a day...no change! I was fooled by the advertisement and \\&quot;reviews\\&quot;. I just wasted my hard earned money! I wish I could get my money back!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I live in the northeast and use this in the winter when my skin is very dry. Much more expensive at other web sites.</li>
    <li> I have oily acne prone skin thought adding oil would make it worse but after reading multiple reviews I decided to give this a try use it morning under makeup and at night. Been using it for over a month now. No breakouts not even the monthly PMS blemishes. I had an issue with previous shipment contacted the suppliers even though it was no fault of their own they quickly rectified the situation. I am very pleased with this product will buy again. I&#x27;ve also added it to my hair care, and general skin care concoctions.</li>
    <li> The oil is so very good for the face, neck, chest skin.  It really shows its worth in the hair.  About 10 pumps for my hair over night and once a week and my old lady hair is as it was when I was in my 20s.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this Argan Oil, I use it on my skin, add it to conditioner, shampoo and body lotion. It&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, but not heavy enough for my course wiry hair. If you have fine hair, it would be great to use before using heat appliances.</li>
