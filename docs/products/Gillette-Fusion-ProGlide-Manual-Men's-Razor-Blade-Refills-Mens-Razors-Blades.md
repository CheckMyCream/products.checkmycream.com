<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What you see is what you get.</li>
    <li> Great value. Exactly as advertised. Razors are so expensive these days. I plan to refill my blades from Amazon every time from here on out. Definitely reccommend.</li>
    <li> thank you, everything is fine!</li>
    <li> Works great and gives a great shave but wish they lasted more than just a few shaves especially for the price,  could not believe how expensive they are.</li>
    <li> It was a great purchase! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I own the power handle and although these are not for the power shaver they work just fine which results in savings!!!</li>
    <li> I have recently received a the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor as a gift from Gillette and used it quite a few times already. The blade is really sharp and smooth while shaving. With this sharp blade, I am able to cleanly shave my chin without leaving any hair bits poking out. My chin feels really smooth and I love it. I rarely use shaving cream because above the blade there&#x27;s a little lubricant to cleanly shave my chin without leaving any cut wounds. I just apply a little water on my chin and it works great. I love this blade and the grip of the razor feels comfortable. I would recommend this to any guys out there with hairy chins like me.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin the the Gillette proglide cartridges allow me to shave closer then ever with no irritation. they are a bit pricey but I totally recommend trying. i was luck an got a free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> Why does a bearded man care about his razor? I probably would not have sought this product on my own, but the razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. Now that I have it, I think it has earned a spot in my beard care tool-kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a furry-faced individual, I don&#x27;t have much in the way of a shaving regimen. Keep my neck-beard to a minimum and make sure the rest doesn&#x27;t creep too far up my cheeks. That&#x27;s about it. Before embracing the full beard, I was a wet-shave safety razor guy. Shaving like our grandfathers and their grandfathers before them. Now, I don&#x27;t really want to go through the hassle and effort that it takes for a proper perfect wet shave when all I&#x27;m shaving is my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the ProGlide cartridge. This morning I had about a week&#x27;s worth of growth on my neck. I was running late for work. I really didn&#x27;t want to let it go another day. From deciding to shave to wiping my clean-shaven neck took me about 2 minutes. Was it the closest shave I ever had? Nope. Was it more than adequate for my day-to-day needs? Yes. Will I use it again? Absolutely.</li>
    <li> This razor ours the best shave from a non power or battery operated razor. It is also a very save blade it lasts a long time and does not nick.</li>
    <li> The Gillette proglide fusion has got to he the very best razor I have ever used.  It got so close to my skin.  Made my skin so smooth that my child loved to rub his face against mine with out the stubble left behind by other blades</li>
    <li> Dealing with sensitive skin is horrible. I would know, I have sensitive skin. Thanks to Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades I never have to deal with it again. Gillette provided me with a free cartridge to test and wow am I amazed. Thank you Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program being run by Gillette, and I was pleasantly surprised with the blade. Typically I use a standard electric razor, so I was a little bit skeptical about trying out a manual razor for the first time. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide was actually surprisingly good. It was not a smooth as the electric razor that I typically use, but it did have some nice features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First having multiple blades instead of just one was a great idea that ultimately made the blade comfortable to use. Second the tip of the razor can be used as a precision tool that really adds value to the blade.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with the razor is that the lubricating strip doesn&#x27;t seem to work, or if it did work the effect was unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I will most likely continue to use this razor because it gives a smooth close shave.</li>
    <li> The blades are thin and placed at the perfect angle for a great clean shave. After shaving with it I was very pleased with the shave and I didn&#x27;t have to use after shave to keep from getting razor burn.</li>
    <li> I got the opportunity by Gillettte via a program to try out their new Fusion ProGlide cartridge and it was great. I usually get really bad razor burn after shaving with my usual razor (store brand),and while I still got some, it was minimal. Smooth gliding, I&#x27;d definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> This Gillette fusion is so great I love it when I shave its refreshing on my face and I feel like I can use it every day and tell very one about it. This product is my number one shaver all the other shavers I used is nothing like this one. Thank god I found the Gillette shaver and I will buy many more through out the year thank you so much.</li>
    <li> The blades effortlessly glided on my face everytime I use it like their fresh out of the box. For someone who shaves with a double edge single blade most of the time these are a great alternative for a quick and close shave. The razor blades I got were given through a program by Gillette for free but this will be a great back up blade especially when traveling. I strongly recommend these blades for anyone with sensitive skin because of the lubrastrip which refreshes your face as you shave. The blade on top was great for those tricky spots and made trimming side burns super easy. Will definitely be buying more cartridges in the future.</li>
    <li> Gillette recently provided me with their Gillette Fusion Proglide razor and I was impressed for it being a cartridge. I&#x27;ve used a Double Edge razor for the past year and nearly completely abandoned cartridges. This cartridge gave a fast clean shave and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I could feel it pulling when I shaved rougher spots (my chin in particular) but even then, it wasn&#x27;t to the point of being uncomfortable. Though I won&#x27;t be getting rid of my Double Edge razor, this is a cartridge I&#x27;d like to keep around for times that I need a fast and easy shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: A fast easy shave that leaves you smooth in under 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It pulls at areas with rougher hair like your chin.</li>
    <li> Gillette I must thank thee, hooking a person up with a great product to try out for you and let the world know how it was. I really like these blades, the cut smooth, get all my little hairs, and even those hard to shave spots under the neck. They also seem to hold up pretty good, and also do not pull on my face and keeps the pain away. i must say this is a great set of cartridges.</li>
    <li> I just received my Gillett Fusion Pro-glide Razor. I must say its the best razor I have ever owned! Love the multiple blades, smooth cut, no nicks or cuts!! I even used it on my heard and a smooth cut it was! I will continue to use these! My wife also tried it and now she has nice smooth legs! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> This it&#x27;s a great all around razor that I received from Gillette to try out. The blades work great on my face with little effort or force which means a neuter shave for me. The GF likes how smooth the razor gets my face which is a major plus. No issues using this razor in my face or neck or transitioning from one to the other. The handle is the best part, perfect design, fits in my hands perfectly with a greatly designed grip.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette razor for a program run by Gillette.  I was excited to try the razor since I saw that it was hitting the market, but turned off by the price.  Gillette is one of my favorite brands to use despite the costs.  I felt that the cartilage works perfectly.  I love that they is a great lubastrip that makes it so much easier and smoother to shave with.  The cartiages are easy to change as well.  It leaves my skin now and smooth.  I&#x27;m an old man with wrinkles and often times, I would get nicks and cuts left and right from shaving, with this razor, I haven&#x27;t had that problem at all.  I&#x27;m happy about this razor.  Thank you Gillette.</li>
    <li> I just got my new Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor a few days ago and have used it twice so far.  It is extremely smooth and I barely feel it go across my skin.  I usually start to feel my beard begin to grow back by mid afternoon but, with the Fusion ProGlide, I don&#x27;t notice anything until later in the evening.  With my old razor I often cut myself but I haven&#x27;t gotten the slightest cut or even irritation.  I do notice the razor is a bit heavy but it is well balanced which compensates for that.  I normally use disposable razors which may also account for the weight difference.  I certainly plan on continuing to use this razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette while they were running a promotion, and it arrived in the mail a few days later. The same evening I opened it and used it. The Fusion Proglide is has a very comfortable handle and the blades were sharp and did the job perfect. As I have been shaving my head for the last 15+ years, it is important to me to have a good razor from a trusted brand, and once again Gillette hit the mark!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for men like me who have jaws that are very square and hard to shave around. I usually have to pull my skin slightly away from my jaw so that I don&#x27;t cut myself, with this razor I didn&#x27;t need to do that. I have pretty coarse hair, and this razor sliced right through it and left a smooth shave. My wife loved that. It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side but to not have cuts, chafing, or left over stubble makes it worth it.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this razor free to try as part of their current promotion and it was satisfactory. It glides smooth even though I&#x27;m still getting used to the style of it.  4 stars only because the shave wasn&#x27;t the closest in the world.  The razor is safe and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Yes the costliness of the blades is a drawback, but you do get a package deal of them and they are durable enough to last. The blades come in a 8 pack which is the best one to get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m really impressed with the close shave, and how long the blades last. This is definitely a razor I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
    <li> The trimmer has a nice weight and feel to it with the rubber grips. I like the opening where you can actually rinse BOTH sides of the cartridge and the lubrastrip made things super smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first strokes pulled a little but after that things got smooth and I was on my way to enjoying a nice, close shave. Where normally I would feel some sort of stubble feels super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I&#x27;m surprised! I&#x27;ve always bought the cheap, plastic so many to a bag razors figuring they were all the same and that a blade is a blade but not anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette?! You have my attention!</li>
    <li> I recently received a free razor from a program run by Gillette.  The Fusion Proglide razor is great.  When I first used it, it did not feel like it was working.  It was very smooth and shaved my facial hair wonderfully.  I got a very close shave on almost all parts of my face.  Why almost?  The cartridge itself is large.  I have a small distance between my top lip and my nose.  It is difficult to shave this area with the Fusion Proglide.  I also would prefer the pivot of the blade to be tighter.  I felt like I lost some control of the blade while shaving.</li>
    <li> I just received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for free from Gillette, to try the great razor. After using the Fusion ProGlide I can honestly say that the razor provides a great close shave! The best feature that the Fusion ProGlide offers is the 5 thin blades, the thin blades are able to provide a close and comfortable shave. After using this razor I enjoy the fact that there will be no razor burn or bumps after shaving due to the thin blades.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me a razor to review in late April and I got around to using it in early May. I have to say it was very a very comfortable shave. I used this with their Styler and was very happy with the results. What I was most impressed with was that the Razor pivots smoothly to fit the contours of your face. Because of that particular reason alone is why I would consider this one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered giving this Razor just a \\&quot;4/5\\&quot;, however the price brought me up that extra star. The quality of this razor surpasses the price of it anyday.</li>
    <li> My first impressions of this product when I opened the box was that it is well built and has a nice grip on it. I used it recently and noticed that it didn&#x27;t cut as good as I thought it would, I usually use Gillette products and never had any complaints. I will probably stick to this razor till I run out of refills and go back to my mach 3 razor.</li>
    <li> THe razor itself is a really good one and shaves really close. It didnt cut me or leave any stuble</li>
    <li> Gillette gave me this product to sample and I really enjoyed it.  My shave was really close and my five o&#x27;clock shadow wasn&#x27;t as bad as it usually is.  The five blade system really gave a clean and close shave.  The detailing side of the blade, however, was underwhelming compared to the awesome other side.  When using it to trim my goatee area into shape, it seemed to get easily clogged  not very smooth shaving. All in all, Great set of blades.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor free from a program Gillette was running.  This is hands down one of the best razors I&#x27;ve used.  The blade gave me a smooth, razor burn free shave not only on my face but on my head as well.  This is a defiant must have for those of use that not only like a smooth soft face but a smooth soft head as well.</li>
    <li> The Gillete fusion pro glide was provided to me by Gillete to try out. I have to admit that this blade on this product is o joke. I usually struggle to get a clean shave and have a five o&#x27;clock shadow show. The blades are smooth and sharp enough to get rid of even the stubborn stubble I had. The blades work well with shaving foam or just water. This is a awesome product.</li>
    <li> I received this blade through a program run by gillete.  The Blade performed very well closely shaving my entire face after a 2 day shaving break to test its strength against a rougher surface since i dont tend to shave on a daily basis in order to save a dollar here and there.  It performed nicely with maybe five breaks to clean the buildup.  It went through smoothly on my chin and upper lip area which tend to be my more sensitive spots while shaving and i felt no pull or tugging at any of my facial hair while shaving. I give the blade a great review and word of mouth to others that wish to feel a smooth shave with little if no discomfort for sensitive shavers.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette. The Gillette Fusion certainly gives a close and smooth shave. I have very sensitive skin, to the point that I can&#x27;t shave every day. I have tried various different razors and even electric razors. I have not found anything that works great for me. Gillette&#x27;s Fusion ProGlide certainly comes fairly close though.</li>
    <li> As part of a promotion from Gillette I received a free razor.  I know it&#x27;ll sound like that clouded my review but honestly, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have sensitive skin and no matter what I try (all those new razors with 5-6 blades, the lubricating strips, etc.) I always end up bleeding or at minimum with my neck very red, bumpy and on fire.  Not so with this razor.  I&#x27;m able to get an incredibly close, clean shave with minimal effort and no irritation. Normally I&#x27;ll have to wait a couple days or so between shaves or else my skin is just too sensitive for a shave, with these blades I&#x27;m able to shave every day.</li>
    <li> Did you mother ever say, \\&quot;Your face is as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom,\\&quot;?  Well, when you get older, that soft face is often the most susceptible to something that can really ruin your day, after shave burn.  You know that feeling of your face itching and burning all day?  How often are you asked, \\&quot;What is all over your face?\\&quot; When what is all over is the remnant of your morning shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very sensitive face and very course facial hair.  For my own personal comfort, I shave anywhere from two to five times a week.  When I shave, I normally use two different lotions before and after shave, sensitive face shaving gel, and I am always looking for a razor that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  I found that razor in the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor cartridge.  Before the ProGlide razor, I was dealing with terrible irritation every time I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of the razor is definitely in the shave itself.  Being a long time user of Gillette products, I know that they are always trying to provide you with the best shave possible, and this razor is no exception.  I was able to try this for free from Gillette directly. It is aptly named ProGlide because it does just that, glides over your face as it shaves.  In my opinion, it does not feel like a typical shave when I use it.  By that I mean I don&#x27;t feel like the razor is tearing hair out of my face.  It feels like the hair is willingly leaving my face to glide away with the razor.  The secret is in the blade&#x27;s design and the enhanced lubrastrip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to communicate that the razor takes away all the skin irritation.  I do deal with some irritation after I shave if for instance I wait too long between shaves, but when I maintain shaving on a regular basis I have found that the irritation is almost completely eradicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a sensitive face, and you are sick of burning, itching skin after shaving with your normal manual razor, it&#x27;s time for you to make the switch to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor cartridges.  I promise, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.ch to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor cartridges.  I promise, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide through a program at Gillette, This is one of the best Cartridges i have ever used the thinner blades produce a smooth cut with no pulling of the hair and no razor bumps after shaving.I will use the Gillette Fusion Proglide from now on, it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> These blades work great and provide a close shave as long as you don&#x27;t have some decent stubble already.&lt;br /&gt;Once my facial hair got some length to it, the blades seemed to pull the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Received this as part of a BzzCampaign and can&#x27;t beat the cost of free.</li>
    <li> The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. After trying the razor I wondered how I have been missing such a great shave. My skin is sensative on my neck and when using my normal blade my screen shows red bumps. With the Gillette blade,  I immediately felt how gentle it was on my neck and how many fewer strokes with the blade was needed. The  After my shave my neck was bump free and felt like a baby. The addendum lubricants on the lubrastrip definitely made a different. There&#x27;s no turning back now. My Gillete Fusion Proglide razor is here to stay.</li>
    <li> I wasnt very excited about this product. I have a goatee and it is too big and bulky to trim around it. I got one free so it was no big deal. I probably wouldnt buy it again.</li>
    <li> after the first shave i was in love. smooth and wonderful works wonders in sensitive skin. i usually have problems with razor burn but thats not a isue with this razor.</li>
    <li> I recieved my free razor and handle through a program from Gillette. I feel this is one of the best blades ever made. It glides along my face and every curve with ease. No matter which way you shave with or against the grain it gives a close smooth cut without razor burn, Nicking or pulling. After shaving with it for two weeks every day the blade cuts as smooth and close as day one. I would recommend it to everyone. And guys your wives and girlfriends will love you for using it too.</li>
    <li> The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Cool Blue/Black color scheme&lt;br /&gt;2) Heavy weight makes the handle seem high quality&lt;br /&gt;3) Black anti-slip rubber handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Packaging isn&#x27;t environmentally friendly&lt;br /&gt;2) Chrome accent on handle is tacky</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands of razors in the past but I have always been partial to Gillette products. This razor blade is the best blade out there - sure, the blades are pricey, but they provide a smoother, closer shave than all the others. Well worth the money - a great value.</li>
    <li> I must say I was leary at first....WAS! The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette and I honestly must admit The Gillette Fusion ProGlide with its redesigned cartridge and handle blew me away. I was able to trim-in my goatee as well as slim up my mustache area with ease and get a pretty decent shave all at the same time - just using the handle &amp; cartridge. My wife even commented on my clean, smoother face several hours after I had shaved. These cartridges are now on my monthly shopping list!! KUDOS to Gillette on getting it right - Now if we could just get the price on cartridges down to a $1.00 it would be revolutionary.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver this is the only one that does not make my skin get cut. i have to shave for work ever day my hair gross fast and i have to stay clean i also got this free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette so thanks you ! back to my review i love that it give&#x27;s me a closer shave and  I felt the smoothness of the shave. Shaving is much quicker because there are few do overs and it does not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> At first I thought that this was more hype from Gillette. After all, how much more can they improve a blade, right? Well, somehow they did. I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette. I thought, \\&quot;What the heck. I&#x27;ll try them.\\&quot; I noticed a difference right away, and it wasn&#x27;t just because I was using a new blade. Sometimes on the weekend, I won&#x27;t shave one day, or I&#x27;ll shave later in the day after doing chores and a nice, hot shower. I don&#x27;t have a particularly tough beard, but waiting to shave later in the day or even the next day usually means an uncomfortable shave. Not with these blades. They&#x27;re noticeably smoother and the shave is closer. No tugging or pulling at hairs, even with a delayed shave. I&#x27;ll be buying more when I need more blades for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle on this razor is amazing. A great look with the blue and chrome finish, the handle on the Gillette Fusion ProGlide feels perfect in my hand. Even when wet, I never loose my grip on the handle. Great product.</li>
    <li> I was a regular fusion user, but was provided an evaluation pro glide cartridge to review. I am impressed by the closeness of the shave and it really did reduce irritation on my face.&lt;br /&gt;That said, the cartridges can&#x27;t get a 5-star review from me because they are too expensive and do not last very long. I shave every three days or so and the old fusion cartridges lasted 3 or so weeks while after 2 shaves I can tell this cartridge is approaching end of life.</li>
    <li> After trying a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor that was provided by Gillette, I felt that this was a good razor overall. However, it did not give me a shave as close as other razors have. On the plus side, I could feel the added lubricants to the strip on the razor head and was able to reach those tricky spots a lot easier.</li>
    <li> I have used the free Gillete Fusion Proglide razor cartridge I received from Gillette in the mail for about a week now, This cartridge is still giving me a close shave and it feels like I put lotion on after I used it.  I hope they keep producing things like this from now. I look forward to trying more of their products in the future.</li>
    <li> Yes, like I said there just fine. The GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE CARTRIDGE product that I tried for free by Gillette was a only 4 stars for me because they waste pretty fast. I don&#x27;t know if its my facial hair maybe its to thick?, but I haven&#x27;t found the one that does great work for me. Nevertheless it still get the job done and I was somewhat happy with it. So for it is the one that&#x27;s working the best for me so far.</li>
    <li> Got to check out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual razor cartridge via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive skin so a good blade is a daily &#x27;must&#x27; for me.  These were great, I never experienced drag or pull, my skin  wasn&#x27;t razor burned or nicked.  Sometimes even sensitive cartridges can make my skin get slightly red or itchy, but these did not affect me in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Colorado where the air is super dry and I noticed these seemed to help my skin be a bit softer, but it didn&#x27;t make me oilier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the cartridges and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a good shave.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide that I received free from Gillette works very well.  I was very impressed on how the grip is on the razor.  My fingers never slipped.  The angle and design of the blades conformed well to my face.  The ProGlide didn&#x27;t even cause my face to break out or anything.  The ease of using this razor is very satisfying. A good clean cut of the whiskers, no pulling of the hair and very easy to use.  2 thumbs up</li>
    <li> These cartridges are a great value. They last for several shavings so only need replacing after maybe 4 uses depending on your own preference. Price is about average.</li>
    <li> I really like these razors; they shave through my hair so smoothly and give that clean smooth shave.  They are a bit costly, but they&#x27;re worth it because each cartridge last me quite a long time as long as you know how to take care of them.  The only thing is about these blades, you have to have good shaving cream because the blades are so close to your skin that without good shaving cream, it&#x27;ll most likely to give razor burns. Beside that, I highly recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> The blades on the razor are really good. Always smooth and sharp. I can shave from every angle and not have to worry much. They seek out and get every hair I have on my face. There is no nicking, pulling or tugging on any hairs. I recieved this product threw a promotion run by Gillette but now I just have to keep it away from my wife.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a gillette fan for a long time now and it is the only razor I will use. So, I was pretty excited when I got to try the Gillette proglide razor as part of a program through Gillette. I have the face that needs to be shaved everyday and the Gillette proglide is doing a very good job. I get a clean and smooth shave through it and I&#x27;ve not nicked myself so far. I also like the handle in general, it is very easy for me to use and maneuver over my face. I do have a couple of issues. Over repeated uses, the lubricated strip gives an icky feel that I am not happy with and the razors in general are expensive.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide blade cartridge via a program ran by Gillette. Since receiving them I am astonished at how amazing they are! The blades cut so smooth and glide right across the skin! It doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m shaving! Since using these my razor burn and cuts no longer exists! I will be purchasing these again!</li>
    <li> I am really glad I have the opportunity to use Gillette&#x27;s ProGlide Manual Razor. For quick shaves, I do like to use an electric razor. However, I used this razor and noticed I can go longer between shaves and I am using the electric razor a lot less. I love the smoothness you can only get with a manual razor. I do not notice any tugging or pulling from this razor. It also truly glides over my face. And it seems to adjust to the \\&quot;nooks and crannies\\&quot; of my face. The handle appears bigger and has a grip on it that is easy to hold onto and does not slip with wet hands. This razor is a must have for me!</li>
    <li> I have tried many razors in my years. This one is one of the nicest razors I have used! It shaves so smoothly and cleanly. Nary a nick anywhere! EVEN AFTER 10 USES! I would recommend the GILLETTE® FUSION® PROGLIDE to anyone tired of crappy disposable razors!</li>
    <li> I stopped using cartridge razors and went to electric, and they just never give you that close shave that you are looking for.  I had always used Gillette before, and when I had the chance to get a free Fusion Proglide through a program run by Gillette I decided to give them a try.  I must say they have done a great job with this razor, the blades are sharp, and cut very smooth, no tug and pull with these.  Very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> i revived this razor free  through a program run by Gillette. i had not used more than 3 blades until i got this and now will never go back to anything less than 5. i have used this about 6 times with no shaving cream and it was great no burn. i would recommend this to any of my shaving friends.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it is a razor. It is good quality, not cheap junk. It gets the job done. I have no complaints about it. It provides a nice close shave. I wasn&#x27;t nicked or cut by it, the moisturizing strip works great. I was happy with the results. This was a free razor and was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette ProGlide via a free program from Gillette.  I started using the ProGlide a couple of weeks ago.  My first impression was fairly average.  It does glide over my face very smoothly, even over my usual bumps and trouble spots.  It does not nick or cut in places that other blades do.  And, so far, it has stayed sharp longer than budget blades.  All in all, if it outlasts my usual blades by a fair margin, they&#x27;ll be worth the extra cost.  But the $30.00 for 8 blades may be off-putting for many buyers.</li>
    <li> Durability of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge blade outlast most others I&#x27;ve previously used. The blades remain sharp all while providing a non-irritating and lubricated shave. In the past it takes very little to irritate my skin, however not once did I experience irritation even in the tricky spots under my chin. Overall an excellent recommendation and great use of feedback via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Too many tiny, narrow blades that clog up immediately. I&#x27;ve been using double-edge razors for years now, and despite this free promo I got from Gillette, I&#x27;m sticking with them.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor to try for free from Gillette and found myself quite impressed. A much closer shave with no irritation than I was expecting. A decent razor cartridge for the price.</li>
    <li> These Fusion Proglide blades are the best out there, hands down. It doesn&#x27;t even feel like shaving when I use these. They can be pricey, but they shave they provide is second to none.</li>
    <li> I break out and look like I&#x27;m 14 every time I use a blade...that is until now.  I have tried so many combos of razors and shaving gels and creams and after shave lotions to stop my face from turning red, but when I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide, I had no issues.  My face was smooth and it took no time to shave.  I Generally only had to get each area with one stroke instead of going back over and irritating my skin.  I will be purchasing more of the cartridges in the future for sure.  I&#x27;m glad Gilette sent me a sample and they should be, too, because they made a customer out of me.</li>
    <li> When I was offered to try out this razor from a campaign that Gillette hosted I was skeptical, I have never been able to use a razor on my neck without dealing with a red rash for about a week, this streak ended when I used this product! I absolutely recommend this to anyone with a similar issue.</li>
    <li> I greatly enjoy using this product. It is smooth and easy to use. I would recommend this product. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have to say I have tried so many other products and as it is Shaving is a chore, Ask anyone at work, but I have found that Gillette is my Favorite razor company. And I have to say that the new Fusion Proglide shaves me so close I am smooth on the first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may just seem like I am shrill for the company but after shaving today before a test it dawned on me This razor is THE BEST..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I wanted to add 1 last thing, just because Gillette sent me 1 free razor doesn&#x27;t mean they bought my vote or comments. This is a true and honest opinion</li>
    <li> There is no razor on the market that compares to Gillette. I am a big fan of the proglide blades. They last a long time, are smooth and provide a close shave.</li>
    <li> So this was a free razor provided through a Gillette program, and I am so glad I had the opportunity because I was not currently using Gillette, but guess what... I am now! This was the best shave I&#x27;ve had in a real long time. I suffer from razor burn, cuts, and shaving is just not pleasant, especially the fact that I do it every other day. The blades on the Fusion Proglide are fantastic. No snagging, No pulling, just a smooth shave without the bumpy redness that follows. I was extremely pleased and this is my NEW razor.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate to have received a free Gilette Fusion razor and blade to try, courtesy of a sampling program by Gilette. The cartridges are easy to find in retail stores where men&#x27;s shaving products are found. They attach and detach from the handle as easily as you&#x27;d want them to. They have a built-in lubrication strip on them similar to other blades, which enables them to glide over your face effortlessly, without drag. They&#x27;re more expensive than other blades I&#x27;ve seen, but it gave me a great shave, and a very comfortable one.  In the past, I&#x27;ve shaved with both the regular and battery-operated handles, and I prefer the battery-powered one better.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from Gillette as a sample. I noticed with&lt;br /&gt;the Gillette pro fusion I had to go over the same spots 2, or 3 times to complete shaving that area, and the Bic flex 4 shaved&lt;br /&gt;with 1 pass without having to repeat. These razors are pretty pricey so you would think they would last longer. I will stick with my Bic.</li>
    <li> Great quality blades.  Just like what you get in the stores.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Blades via a program run by Gillette. These blades provide an extremely close shave that lasts much longer than with any other razor or blades. The other benefit that this blade provides is the speed at which it is able to cut through the hair. Even when I have allowed my beard to grow to a fuller length these blades make easy work of the job. Having mentioned that the daily work is a breeze by comparison and makes a once dreaded morning job easy. If there is one drawback to the five close blades is that at times it does get clogged and requires it to be cleaned thoroughly before moving on to finishing the job. Overall, this is a great blade that does an amazing job of shaving and keeping my skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I was given the Gillette Pro Glide manual razor to try and let me tell you, I wont be buying any other brand. It leaves my skin smooth, without irritation and the number of times I get out of just one razor is amazing, this is definitely a well worth purchase</li>
    <li> I received this razor free via a program run by Gillette. My preferred razor has always been Gillette and this blade measured up to my expectations. Sometimes I will use cheap disposable razors to save money, but they just cant compare to the shave with the Gillette Fusion. The blades are sharp for a close shave with less strokes and less irritation.  The blades will stay sharp through a few shaves too. Also noticed that my face felt smoother longer with these blades vs other razors I&#x27;ve tried. Just wish they were more affordable!</li>
    <li> This cartridge i got was a free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette the blades do not tug on the hair like others it glides over the skin smoothly and leavesa nice close clean shave.</li>
    <li> When I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide free from Gillette I wondered if it really could hold up the test! Well, I was pleasantly surprised. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridges last along time for me, the cartridge stays sharp without pulls or nicks. Can not go wrong this product.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide gave me the closest and smoothest shave ever...I received this cartridge free through a program from Gillette. had a good amount of facial hair and the cartridges included cut right down to the skin. I also noticed that I had an easier time cleaning the blade. Other products get hair stuck between the blades and you have to bang the cartridge blade many times on the sink. This is defintately a great buy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Brandano</li>
    <li> Before receiving this product from a program ran by Gillette I had dreaded shaving. I would go back and forth from using an electric shaver and a hand held shaver. The electric shaver was a miserable experience; I would get razor burn and a very poor shave. If I was going out in the evening, I would have to shave again and my face was red and raw. In frustration, I would switch to the hand held razor. If the blade was new and I was not careful, I would nick my face. The morning after a new razor was no fun. My face would be decorated with tissue paper to stem the bleeding. Over the years, I used almost every different type of razor, including the disposable kind. I would sometimes get skin burns, rashes and irritation from the blades in an effort to get a good shave.. My face has very sensitive skin and when using my new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, I have no problem with my baby face skin... From the moment I put the razor on my face and started to shave, I felt the difference. The blades used on this were extra soft and made the glide that much easier. There was absolutely no tugging and my face felt very smooth and I did not question my judgment in using the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power. I also love the fact that I do not need to keep the unit plugged in for recharging purposes. There is one negative and that is with the blade re-fills and there high cost. Coming from a man who has two kids in college, I hate spending money on myself when I have other obligations. To buy a new 6 count cartridge for $28+ is crazy and rather expensive. Nonetheless, the grip on the razor feels great and the razor is very easy to maneuver. I was concerned that since the handle was larger, I would have problems get use to the design, but the larger size of the handle actually improved my shaving experience. The new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power is a very comfortable unit and works great on my highly sensitive skin. I would highly recommend the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power because it is a well-designed razor I have ever used! I will be happy to say that I will not spend my time looking for a new razor.[[ASIN:B003983HRI Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor, 1-count Package]][[ASIN:B003KWO3UI Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual 1 Up Razor]][[ASIN:B003987CL0 Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, 1-count Package]]wer because it is a well-designed razor I have ever used!

    <li> Pretty much the gold standard for mens shaving.  The pricing fluctuates a lot; I try to keep a few extras on hand and order when the price is lower.  No issues from this great product.</li>
    <li> This Gillette Fusion Proglide blade does what it&#x27;s advertised to do:  provide a close, comfortable  shave.  I can endorse its claim to be good on sensitive skin.  I started using these blades a few years ago and have never found a better option.  I&#x27;ve tried others but none seem to provide as good as these.</li>
    <li> This free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.  I love this razor very much. My old razor just wouldn&#x27;t clean out very well, would get clogged by the shaving cream where as this one doesn&#x27;t do that. Cleans out good which gives me a much closer shave.</li>
    <li> I received a Fusion ProGlide razor as part of a Gillette program. I was surprised when I used it for the first time. The five blades are very smooth, leaving me feeling comfortable after a shave. The single blade was also very nice for styling sideburns and facial hair. After a decent amount of use, I could begin to feel a little tug while shaving, but that is to be expected from any cartridge. I enjoyed this razor more than others that I have used and plan on purchasing more cartridges in the near future. Overall, a great razor!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette fusion razor from a program ran by Gillette to test and review for free. I must say that the blades are smaller then my other razors which gives me a cleaner and closer shave. I didn&#x27;t get any cut while shaving which is great. Can&#x27;t be going to work with cut all over my face. I also noticed that it lefted my face feeling smooth, not much stumbled lefted behind.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor as a sample. I have very sensitive skin and many razors will irritate my face breaking me out. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with this razor at all! It left my skin feeling smooth as silk!!  Here are the pros I liked about the handle I loved the grips throughout the handle. I liked where the cartridge release was located, it was very practical it&#x27;s tucked under the top area of the handle to prevent accidental releasing of the cartridge blade The width of the handle was nice which helped me grip on to the handle better.</li>
    <li> I recently tried this razor for the first time and really enjoyed it. Its good quality and sleek design drew me in from the get go. Its a bright cool blue and appears to hold up to water and remains rust free and solid quality. I recommend this to both my roommates. And they both agreed. Were now sticking to the fusion razors!</li>
    <li> I got the head through a free program run by Gillette, and it offers a very smooth shave. although I do not really notice a difference in the smoothness and uniformity of the shave between the Proglide and the Mach 5(Gillette&#x27;s previous model)The one big difference is the precision blade on the back of the head. It is much better than the one on the Mach 5 and is a noticeable improvement. All in all I would definitely get this razor, seeing as it is the newest model and performs just as well if not a little better(due to the better precision blade) than the previous model</li>
    <li> Using the Gillete fusion proglide has been great!  I recieved the cartridge from a program run by Gillette for free!  The closeness of the shave is as close as razor I have used and by far better then most!  I will happily be using Gillette Fusion Proglide in the future!</li>
    <li> Upon receiving the free ProGlide razor provided by Gillette I noticed the whole system looked pretty cool. Prior to my first use I used my usual pre-shave scrub by Every Man Jack to allow for a better shave. After lathering up my face I started on the two day stubble. The razor moved across my face like it was gliding over glass. While going both with and against the grain, the ProGlide didn&#x27;t tug at all. The Gillette ProGlide, with the addition of a quality pre-shave scrub, makes for a fantastic shaving experience. The second shave was equally smooth. The third is where the gliding started to meet with friction. After the third shave I tried it without the pre-shave scrub. The blades were at the point that I experience a few small spots of tugging and, if I wasn&#x27;t careful, a knick around the jawline. The ProGlide does provide an almost unparalleled shave the first few times, but it&#x27;s crispness fades quickly. Do your face a favor and be sure to compliment this fine blade with a quality pre-shave scrub.</li>
    <li> I shave every single day and a lot of times I will cut myself but not with this razor. It glides across so smoothly with no nicks. The strip on the top lubricates with water and makes the skin surface smooth and slick. Even the hard to reach places are easy to shave! I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot repeatedly because it gets it the first time. I love this razor and I will keep using. Thank you Gillette for allowing me to try this through the free program I really appreciate all you do!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this razor but after using it it has changed my views. I normally use the schick hydro 5 and have so for the past 5 or more years. I recieved this free sample and think after just using it once i might just have to change razors. The razors contoured to my skin and the sharpness of the blades cut my hair but not my skin. The easy of use and fleibility of the handle work with my face.</li>
    <li> I recently tried the new gillette fusion proglide razor. It was provided to me free via a program run by gillette. when I first recieved this razor I thought okay its just another razor. When I tried it for the first time I was immpressed, the blades on this razor gave me one of the closest shaves ive had in a long time. Even my girlfriend noticed how smooth my face was after I shaved. The swivel head on this razor hugged ever curve on my face. Ive used this razor three times already and its still working like the first time i used it. I work definetley buy this razor again its worth ever penny..</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard. As a consequence to this, I go through blades very quickly. Sometimes I have to to use two blades per shave. Gillette sent me a free razor as part of a promotion.  This blade lasted the entire shave. The open back helped in ridding the blade of hair, and the hair came out of the blade much easier than any other disposable blade that I have used before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become a huge fan of the Gillette razor blade cartridge since receiving it to try for free from a program sponsored by Gillette. The multiple blades are sharp and provide a close, clean shave that lasts. The blades feel sturdy, not flimsy, but don&#x27;t weigh down the razor and they hug my skin so there&#x27;s no accidental cuts or nicks. This is a great set of blades!</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette razors in the past but it had been awhile until I received this free ProGlide from them. All I can really say is they provide a great shave every time. I am not one to use shaving cream, just warm water, and I definitely notice a better softer shave with the new ProGlide cartridges.</li>
    <li> I have been a Gillette customer since I have been old enough to shave. I have been very happy with the Mach 3 blades. However when I received a free Fusion pro glide as a sample from Gillette in the mail I immediately fell in love with the product. It is quite easily the smoothest shave I have ever experienced, there is no drag with the blades being closer together also having sensitive skin I did not get the razor burn I had got in the past.</li>
    <li> When I first heard the ProGlide was coming out, I was a bit skeptical on how it could be that much better than the regular Fusion. As is turned out, the ProGlide is better and noticeably so. There is definitely much less resistance when sliding this across my face. It also seems like I am getting a closer shave. The best part of the ProGlide is that your can use your old Fusion handles to attach the blades onto. No need to buy special ProGlide handles. My Skin feels smooth and doesnt get dry neither do i get little red bumps from shaving with this razor</li>
    <li> With little effort I had the cleanest and smoothest shave of my life, with no irritation on my sensitive neck. The razor glides so smoothly across your skin it does not even feel like you are shaving, yet all hair and stubble are completely removed. Thanks to Gillette for offering me this free razor through a promotion- I will definitely be purchasing my next one.</li>
    <li> This razor is really nice to my face. It feels better than any other razor I&#x27;ve used. However, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s as close a shave as other razors. I have to make more passes, and still wind up with rougher stubble than with other razors. I got the razor as a sample through Gillette, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay top dollar for this razor. I think it&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;d rather trade a little comfort for a better shave.</li>
    <li> The razor is ok. It did its job but  not overly impressed. Not sure if I would get it again.</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Fusion Proglide for free from a prgram run by gillette and boy am I happy I did. Now I am a user versus a looker.  The blades on this razor are simply amazing. Not only was I just able to shave using water (also in thanks to the lubricants on the lubrastrip), but it is also the smoothest shave I have ever gotten without getting nicked at all. Basically finished feeling liek I got the razor treatment from the barber. Very professional. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> My husband has really course hair and decided to try this product for all that it promised. He received it for free as part of a campaign ran by Gillette. Usually, his shaves aren&#x27;t too close, and shows a 5 oclock shadow within a few hours.  Also, the blades don&#x27;t stay sharp long on other razors.  This one is a different story.  His face stays smooth longer, and he can use one cartridge for a lot longer than other brands.  Because of this, this brand saves us money in the long run.  I will be buying more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette. After a few weeks use I have to say I am very impressed. With how smoothly it shaves I am able to shave quickly with out irritation. Though I have only had to do it once, I have to say replacing the razor was very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Last longer then traditional disposable razors I have used.&lt;br /&gt; - Very easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt; - Shaves with less tug and pull, cuts through the hair smoothly.&lt;br /&gt; - Closer shave than any other disposable, leaves my face feeling smooth and very touch able for my significant other.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - Cost, but you pay for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridges. You may pay a bit more but they last longer, give you a more comfortable shave, and give you a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor to try via a program run by Gillette. I have to say that these blades are fantastic! True to the name, they glide across your face like a pro. They have provided the closest and easiest shaving experience that I&#x27;ve ever had in my almost 30 years of shaving. They look like they are a bit pricey, but I will definitely be ordering refills when this one gets dull.</li>
    <li> I received this razor during a promotional campaign by Gillette and have had the opportunity to test these razor blades under &#x27;extreme&#x27; conditions. Stationed in a far distant sandy environment was the perfect place to test the endurance of this razor. It held up well under continuos use, was very easy to clean, and got right at those problem areas (close to the nose and sides of the mouth). The only drawback, and thus the 4/5 stars, is that the blades do not last too long. About 5 uses and they are history. All in all...a great product though.</li>
    <li> I was really look forward to try this free from a program ran by Gillette. This is a great razor with one down fall...the blades clog up to easily. Wonderful idea with 5 blades but being so close together it&#x27;s hard to get the hairs out from within the blades when rinsing. It does give a good shave, just takes a little extra time.</li>
    <li> When I had received this, my wife was interested in it. She decided to take mine &amp; use it to shave. All I can say is, her venus razors are gone. She now only needs one. She explained to me that it got a closer shave for her on pits &amp; legs. She doesn&#x27;t need to shave as often. All I know now, is I need to buy another one for myself.</li>
    <li> I love this new razor. It was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette. Since using it I have noticed a much cleaner shave that seems to last longer then my other razor. The blades are easy to change, remove, and attach. I have also had fewer nicks and razor bumps from this. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This razor is like no other! Excellent 5 razors that keeps the shave smooth and clean. The blue aloe from the top of the razor still keeps my skin refreshed after every shave. The grip of the handle is another great benefit, especially if you have arthritis. So far I&#x27;ve used this razor 10 times and it&#x27;s still brand new. Thank Gillette Fusion for making another amazing product! :)</li>
    <li> The cartridge works great for the first few times. It is definelty an improvement on older versions. They just don&#x27;t last as long as I think they should. I get a nice close shave. I have sensitive skin and it doesnt irritate it, which is nice. I will definelty be buying them, but just because I havent found anything better out there.</li>
    <li> I got a sample razor from buzzagent.com to try for myself and tried it out. I was very impressed with the quality and design of the razor. The rubber grips on the handle make it very easy to hold without fear of slipping and cutting. The blades gave a nice smooth comfortable close cut shave. I have an issue with bumps after shaving and using this razor with the Gillette foaming gel for sensitive skin worked amazingly well. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to start shaving or change their current brand razor.</li>
    <li> First of all, I received the razor free to try from a Gillette program. This product rates up there as one of the better ones. Very close shave, with no irritation afterwards. If you are looking for a comfortable shave that is very smooth, I recommend you give this a try.</li>
    <li> I shave on a daily basis because I am very hairy.  The new razors on the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE make for a much closer and more comfortable shave.  The only negative thing I can say about the new blades is I broke out slightly from the Lubrastrip, which is unfortunate because it definitely made for a closer cut.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide manual razor for the past two weeks. The five blade design has provided a very smooth shave while eliminating discomfort associated with traditional manual razors. The blade moves smoothly across the skin and is as close of a shave as I can ever remember having. The ridges along the leading edge pull the hairs up just enough without causing any snags. The modular design of the blade assembly makes them easy to swap out as needed. I appreciate the opportunity to try out this excellent razor courtesy of Gillette, free of charge.</li>
    <li> I received the blades for free by a program ran by Gillete, and I must say, I really like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-They didn&#x27;t get full of hair&lt;br /&gt;-They left my face smooth&lt;br /&gt;-And I had very minimal razor burn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like the blades!</li>
    <li> Substantial feel, close smooth action.  A good bit larger cartridge than the Mach 3 I&#x27;d been used to, but became a fan of the 5 blade tool pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I have used. I have very sensitive skin and there were not any of those pesky red bumps after shaving. It was also one of the closest shaves I have ever had. Normally my wife comments on the stubble I still have after shaving, but not this time. The lubricating strip on the cartridge was nice. It left my skin feeling very smooth. These blades rock!</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide manual razor with a cartridge, courtesy of a program ran by Gillette. I am not much of a regular razor kind of person, I have used electric for as long as I can remember. Well the Gillette fusion proglide changed my mind. It provided a nice close shave without out pulling or tugging on my beard. I didn&#x27;t come out of the shave without razor burn which is always nice. If you like a nice clean shave without the pulling and tugging Gillette fusion proglide is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> I noticed the handle I received from Gillette is very sleek, and simple to grip. The way the head attaches to this handle is durable, and won&#x27;t come loose. Its packaging is very attractive, and is easy to hold, and doesn&#x27;t slip. I also received this razor free from Gillette as a promotional offer, and it&#x27;s the best of its kind I have ever used. A great gift, one well worth the money, and to get it free from Gillette is a fantastic bonus! I would recommend people to try this because it has new improvements</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion Proglide through a program run by Gillette and have used the blades now for a couple of weeks.  I had switched to using an electric razor after the frustrations of how often I had to change straight blades due to my course beard.  This promotion provided me a chance to give straight shaving another chance.  The proglide was a very comfortable blade that didn&#x27;t leave razor burn after the first couple of uses.  The blade was very smooth, probably the smoothest I&#x27;ve used of that sort.  Gillette did a good job with this, unfortunately it still didn&#x27;t last any longer than any blades I&#x27;ve used in the past. After the third shave, I was ready to switch blades because it was burning and catching. It also still had the same problems with my course beard that I&#x27;ve had in the past, it had a hard time getting the hairs on my neck. I&#x27;ve decided to stick with electric because I can&#x27;t afford to switch blades more than once a week.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor a few weeks ago, and have been using it daily.  I think I can give a good review of it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this razor. The way I use/abuse razors, I just use hot water to shave.  My beard grows pretty fast, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unusually thick or tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t shave on weekends, and the first time I used this blade, I had just finished up a 3 day weekend.  So, I had a good baseline beard to test this out with.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide cut through like it was butter.  It&#x27;s also incredibly light, at first I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to shave well.  It seemed like it was barely touching my skin.  But, not a single pull or tug while shaving.  This &#x27;lubrastrip&#x27; really does a great job.  My face was completely smooth, the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time and with no burn at all.  The precision trimmer blade worked well also, helping to clean up in hard to hit areas (nose, edge of lips, etc.), I&#x27;ve had other blades that don&#x27;t do this very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is durability.  After the first week I noticed I was not getting as close of a shave any more.  Two weeks in, the &#x27;lubrastrip&#x27; started falling apart, and I started feeling the shave. I do everything you&#x27;re supposed to do to try and extend the life of a blade.  But, I&#x27;ve noticed this with Gillette razors in the past - I get great shaves a few times, then it goes downhill pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I think this ProGlide has given me the best shave experience out of any previous Gillette product.  Even if they don&#x27;t last long (for me), the blades are great when they work.  And maybe I just expect too much out of a razor, but the cost of replacement cartridges makes me want to get as many good shaves as possible out of each one.</li>
    <li> Only tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide because the razor was free via a program run by Gillette.  I had been using the Shick Hydro for about the last 5 years.  I thought it was doing a great job until I tried the Fusion ProGlide.  The ProGlide was a smoother and closer shave with no irritation to my face.  The added razor on the back side of the ProGlide really comes in handy for getting in around your nose and sideburns.</li>
    <li> I received a free set of these cartridges provided via a program run by Gillette. the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge is a great product!! other razors I have tried before did not give me the close shave that Gillette Fusion ProGlide does! it doesn&#x27;t pull and tug at your wiskers either.it gives a good close shave.I like the blade on the top to trim with also.it is worth paying for to get a great shave! my wife even likes this razor too!!</li>
    <li> In my 30 plus years of shaving, this is simply put, The Best Razor I have ever used, hands down. You have to try it.</li>
    <li> I really LOVE any of the Gillette Razors, but this I like the best. The handle is easy to grip and you don&#x27;t have it slipping out of your hand. This was received free from Buzz Agent to try it out. I also LOVE the blades. They are very sharp at first so watch applying too much pressure while shaving. They stay sharp for a long time.I can use a blade for at least 3 months and have it still useable. I find this to be a really wonderful product and would definately buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife signed me up to receive a free sample from Gillette a Proglide Fusion cartridge, I normally shave with an electric razor. As I opened the product I noticed how the handle was very comfortable to hold and as I shaved I felt how smooth of a shave I was receiving. It has very sharp blades and I didn&#x27;t have to go over twice as I usually have to do . This is a very good product I will certainly buy another after I use this one up,  Thank You Gillette, Raymundo Torres.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion as part of a free Gillette program, as I was not ready to spend so much on a shaving system just to try it. It has been the best shave I&#x27;ve had and it was good enough for my son for his first shave. We&#x27;re hooked!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this razor. Once it arrived I lathered up to try it out.I got through a total of two swipes with this razor and had to put it down and grab one of my disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why but this razor pulled the hair out of my face instead of cutting it as other razors do (or at least it felt like it was pulling instead of cutting!). It may be just me but it was not a pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> I received this free through a promotion by Gillette, and happily gave it a few trial runs. I have pretty thick facial hair, and I find that most razors dull quickly. The hair also tends to get stuck between blades, and it can be a literal pain to get it out. This one&#x27;s stayed sharp through three thorough shaves so far, with no clogging. The detail blade on the back is a nice touch, and even that rinses out easily.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;m not thrilled with is that I have to use more strokes to clear an area with this cartridge than others I&#x27;ve tried, so that means more time spent and more shaving cream used. Still, the longevity balances this out for me.</li>
    <li> This razor gave me a close shave without tugging . I am usually weary of multi blade razors but this one is designed right</li>
    <li> Love it, very smooth, it glides perfectly and my shave is very close and smooth. My wife commented on how close the shave was and last for me several days. Abit expensive but as other posters have suggested, taking care of the blade and drying it off will make it last longer. Very impressed and diffently will make it my go to blade.</li>
    <li> I must say as a user of the Mach 3 for the longest time it really was a pleasure to use this blade. The blade effortlessly glides through my thicket of hair and begs for more. The single trimmer blade is pretty nice too. Especially if you are carving out a goatee. I have used a single blade for a few weeks and Im sure that I have a lot more shaving to do before it is dull enough to change it. I got this thing free and Im glad I did. Im a convert now.</li>
    <li> My name is Tom and I got to try this razor free  via a program run by Gillette. I found it to be a good razor. I got a close shave with no cuts, no pulling. Very comfortable razor to use. I will continue to use the product and I do recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I tend to let my facial hair grow for about a month between shaves. I don&#x27;t really like shaving and my wife likes it when I have a beard. Sometimes though, you just need to have a good shave to feel refreshed. I got some blades for free from Gillette so I thought I would give them a try. I&#x27;ve been using an old Mach 3 and was wanting to try the latest shaving technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades themselves feel rather heavy and well made; lots of metal and lots of blades. I&#x27;m not one to care about the blade count thing, I just want something that works well. The lubrastrip feels better than any other blade and makes the shave more pleasant. The trimmer blade is nice for shaping my beard or getting that one hair. But the main attractions are the main blades. They follow my face for a really close shave and rarely caused any cuts (those could have been my fault). They main issues I have are with how thin and fine the blades are. My hair is very thick and hard to cut through. The blades cut better than other brands, but they don&#x27;t last as long. I assume the fine edge and thinness of the blades causes them to wear quickly on my hair. I guess it&#x27;s a trade off between great shave but spend more to replace the blades or good shave and by blades less often. For me, I only shave once a month so I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying these since a pack will last a year or so but if you have thick hair you may decide they cost too much.</li>
    <li> Honestly this is the best blade I have ever had! Being in the military requires me to shave, on a daily bases and the worst thing is a bad blade. I got a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge and I can&#x27;t stop using them. Here are the pros:  closest blade ever, allow band doesn&#x27;t dry out skin &amp; prevents razor burn, rubber edges prevent cuts, provide smooth and comfortable shave. The 5 blade requires minimal swipes for a close shave. I would recommend this blade to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received this to try via a program run by Gillette. I usually use Gillette so I new I liked the brand, when I first tried them I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with the thinner blades. Later on in the day I noticed my face felt a lot smoother then when I use other razors. They are a little pricey but you are able to use the blade far longer then the cheaper ones! All in all I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Skeptical as to why Gillette would provide me with a free razor through one of their programs I decided to try to Fusion ProGlide. Much to my pleasant surprise the ProGlide literally glides smoothly over my sensitive skin and provides the nice close, clean-cut shave I am looking for. I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future. Great work, Gillette - you have successfully convinced me that your product is superior!</li>
    <li> I like the new cartridges because the precision trimmer works perfect. I always had trouble getting the spot under my nose and this makes it so easy and fast. I think the 5 blades work well, providing a close shave, however the close spacing makes it a lot harder to rinse the blades. The \\&quot;Enlarged Lubrastrip\\&quot; only makes a difference on the first shave by cutting down the total shave time. I was given the opportunity to try this product through a program run by Gillette and am proud to say I will be buying more of these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try the Fusion ProGlide and have never been happier with a razor before. It is so smooooooothe! I actually look forward to shaving now. I used to get lazy about shaving, but it&#x27;s so much easier to get a smooth and clean shave now, I shave several times a week. Love it.</li>
    <li> The blades deliver a close shave, more than I thought possible. I received these in the mail from a program run by Gillette. They wanted my honest opinion so here it is. The blades shave close but seem to not stay sharp as long as I want them to. But when new they get the difficult hair around my lips without any being left.</li>
    <li> I was able to try these blades for free due to a program that Gillette was doing.  At first thought I figured it was just like any other razor and would do the job just as well as the next one.  But I was wrong I used to have trouble shaving my neck and I would often get small cuts due to my rough sink and my neck would burn a bit.  But with this new Fusion ProGlide by Gillette there is little to no skin irritation and I more likely to shave on a regular basis whereas before I hated shaving and would only shave once a week or so.  Now I don&#x27;t have a problem shaving 3 to 4 times a week.  Thanks Gillette for creating a great product.</li>
    <li> When the Gillette fusion proglide first came out, I was skeptical about how well it would work.  After receiving a free one from Gillette Fusion ProGlide, I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only did it deliver on the easily and smoothly gliding across all the stubble I have but, my face is very smooth and soft. I also like the fact that the cartridges fit the Gillette fusion handle I already have. A definite bonus! All in all, this razor for me is a definite must have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not your typical manual razor user.  I&#x27;m a 3 head electric user, but I received the razor as part of a promotion run by Gillette.  I&#x27;m an electric razor guy, even to the point that I go out of my way not to use a manual razor.  If my batteries are dead, I don&#x27;t shave that day.  It&#x27;s just something that I&#x27;ve gotten used to and haven&#x27;t ever gone back to shaving with manual blades.  However, for this promotion, I was willing to give it a try.  My routine had to be modified, and I gave myself plenty of time to try out these blades effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to wait until I had more than just stubble.  I typically shave once every 2-3 days, as my facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow extremely fast, but after a few days, I&#x27;ll have noticeable hair on my face and neck.  I decided to shave right before bed.  I prepared my face with a wet, warm washcloth.  I have some good shave gel that I brought out from hiding.  I first noticed the nice feel and weight of the handle, but this review is specifically on the blades and the shave.  I shaved as normal.  I have a very sensitive chin and even with my electric razor, I don&#x27;t like shaving my chin because of the sensitivity.  With the Proglide, the chin was much easier than expected.  Having several blades, it was able to remove the hair without me having to go over the area several times.  My cheeks and neck were also very easy to shave.  At no time did it feel like I had to make any extra effort to remove hair.  It removed hair around my adam&#x27;s apple and the curves of my neck very well...dare I say, better than my electric razor.  This was expected, but I was very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, there was no burn or cuts.  I was very proud of myself...and my new razor.  I will continue to use this razor for a while, now that the manual razor hiatus has been lifted.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free through a program that Gillette was offering.  I was skeptical at first as to all the hype surrounding another \\&quot;new\\&quot; razor.  How much different could it be from my existing razor or any other razor for that matter.  WOW! Was I wrong.  From the very first pass I noticed a huge difference.  There was no pulling...just smooth gliding.  Compared to my previous razor I could tell a huge difference just on the first pass.  Instead of having to make multiple passes that usually end up leading to razor burn, the first pass left me smoother and more clean shaven.  Would I recommend this razor...ABSOLUTELY!</li>
    <li> The thing I hate most about shaving is the tug that you experience as the razor glides across the stubble. So much so, that I put off shaving for as long as I possible can. When Gillette included me in a program they had running and sent me a free sample of the razor, I instantly fell in love. There&#x27;s no tugging, no pulling, and the razor leaves my skin soft and smooth- use after use. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now, and it feels the same as it did on day one! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this razor.</li>
    <li> I really like the Fusion Proglide Blade. You can tell the difference from a cheaper store brand and the real product. The blades glide smoothly and give a close shave. Works well with shaving gel as well.&lt;br /&gt;Only con is the price.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a free razor to try via a program through Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette.  This is the first time that I have used this product, and I must say that I am pleased with the results.  I have folliculitis on my face, and this razor is gentle on that area, while still giving me a close, smooth shave.  The price of the cartridges is a little much; HOWEVER, you get what you pay for, and if you are paying for a great shave, then it is totally worth every penny.  I strongly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor and cartridges to any man who needs a great, close shave!!</li>
    <li> I like my Gillette Fusion ProGlide. I was provided with a free razor through  Gillette. I think it&#x27;s a great product. I have very sensitive skin and found that the blades gave me a close shave and I didn&#x27;t break out. I got a very smooth clean outcome ever time I used it. There was only one thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars, I wished the Lubrastrip lasted longer than 3 shaves. The product description states it can last 5 weeks, however; I disagree because of the Lubrastrip. With the five blade system I found I didn&#x27;t have to go over areas more then once.</li>
    <li> I used to be hesitant of multi-blade razors. I remember SNL&#x27;s parody sketch about a ridiculous razor with three blades... here we are, years later, and we&#x27;re at five blades in real life... Gillette sent me a razor through a promotional program and I tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five blades on this razor are surprisingly smooth and durable. I have a light beard and the razor cartridge will last a month before starting to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; on my hair. Having tried the smoothness of the five-blade razor, I would be hesitant to go back to less blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, the best part of this razor is the single blade on the reverse side which allows for precision trimming and helps with beard-shaping. This product gives me the best of both worlds and Gillette has earned a new customer.</li>
    <li> After testing this razor which was sent to me as part of a promotional program by Gillette, I must say the ergonomic design, easy handle grip and 5 blade system was a refreshing surprise to see how Gillette has developed into America&#x27;s No. 1 manufacturer for shaving solutions. I have hair that grows above and below tender areas of my mouth and sporting a goatee, I have to say I was thoroughly impressed with how it hug the contours of my face for a smooth shave. If i had any doubts about how this would work, I don&#x27;t now, plus the blades LAST LONGER and less sessions between shaves as one blade follows another for the cleanest shave a man or woman can get. Thanks Gillette and keep up the good work in improving products for men and women. I&#x27;ll tell my friends this razor is definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> I recieved a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge via a program run by gillette. Although the blade did provide a close shave, even with all the new tweaks made to the blades and the lubricant pad it still left with with really bad razor bumps that seemed to last longer than usual, I like the closeness of the shave but did not like the aftermath it left on my neck.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a free sample from Bzz Agent. I was hoping it would be better than other razors I have tried. I have very think facial hair and after I shave even with gel or shaving cream I still have an itchy face and razor bumps. This razor blade system is great. After using it I have had no itchy face or razor bumps. I will be buying these blades and using this system it is great.</li>
    <li> I got an opportunity to try this razor via a free program ran by Gillette and I must say im impressed i didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as it did. i have sensitive skin and i frequently get razor bumps not with this product. Also i go thru cartridges like there&#x27;s no tomorrow and these cartridges last longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried. i would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette fusion proglide manual cartridge as free as part program run by Gillette. Overall it was an excellent product, the blades last for several shaves and are very efficient. The other thing I liked about the blades were that they did not irritate my skin. Overall i was definitely satisfied with the them and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from a program run by Gillette.  I thought that it gave a good close shave due to the lubricant built into the cartridge.  The trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge was useful for getting the hard to get rid of stubble close to my nose.  I had to be extra careful not to cut myself when getting the hairs on the curve of my chin.  I almost nicked myself due to all the blades in that one spot.</li>
    <li> I really thought when I received the Gillette razor free by a program that Gillette was running I would really have a great shave. The razor in the package looked great then I opened it up the handle had a great feel then I got ready to get rid of 2 days of whiskers. Boy was I really surprised I hadn&#x27;t even got 3/4 of he way done an the blades were already dull,surprise disapointing. I had to finish up with my double edge safety razor,bummer.</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette razors ever since I first began shaving, and when offered the chance to review the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Blade Cartridge through a program run by said company.... I jumped on the opportunity. These razor blades have always been more than adequate for my needs, whether they are being used for all over shaving or just to trim up my face using the precision trimmer. The result is always a smooth shave with little to no tugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all good things, it must have a drawback. And for this it is the fact that they dull fairly quickly. I admit I dont always replace them when they do so because of the price of replacements, but eventually I do. The blades are everything I have come to expect from Gillette. Overall, if they lasted a little longer they would have gotten five stars. Regardless I will continue to be a user of the Gillette brand as they havent let me down yet.</li>
    <li> I had the chance to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor through a Gillette Product Program. I have to say I have tried just about ALL Gillette manual razors and have yet not found the perfect one until I tried the Proglide. The name says it all, PROGLIDE! Literally I feel the blades glide through my face, neck, and head leaving them feeling amazingly smooth, soft and bump free. Also making my shaving experience and timing much less then usual, something my wife LOVES! She tells me my face looks more youthful and healthier ever since using the Gillette Fusion Proglide. My Daughter stays feeling on my face with a big smile not feeling stubs and bumps telling me, \\&quot;WoW Daddy Super Silky, Super Soft\\&quot;! Puts a smile on my face. So all left to say is if your looking for the most ultimate smooth, bump free experience the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I have tried every kind of manual razor that is out there and let me tell you that this is so far the best one that I have used to this day. It feels comfortable in your hand and cuts smoothly. After using this razor I will never switch to any other brand. Oh and I forgot to mention I got it for free from a program that Gillette is running!!</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this in the mail and it was the best my face has felt in a long time, I almost forgot how good Gillette makes razors. This past Christmas I got one of those jumbo packs of razor cartridges that you would find on the shelf of some wholesale club. I put my Gillette in the cabinet and started using this other brand because I figured what the heck, might as well not let them go to waste. The blades dulled fast so you need the jumbo pack just to last. I felt like I was constantly changing the cartridges and it just didn&#x27;t make my face feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I saw Gillette offering a free sample so I wanted to compare the two and instantly my face felt the difference. My wife and kids weren&#x27;t afraid to kiss me on the cheek anymore after they felt how smooth my face felt again. I&#x27;m not looking back now, Gillette is the only brand I will allow in my house. And for my lousy gift giving relative, his birthday is right around the corner and I will be picking up a Gillette gift pack for him.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program run by Gillette, and was very pleased with the results. I was not expecting much, and had used a Shick Quattro razor previously, which does not compare to this. This new Gillette razor worked flawlessly and left no razor burn and flowed very smoothly. Overall pleased with this razor cartridge.</li>
    <li> My fiance recieved a free razor via a program run by Gillette; however, he left it sitting on the sink....unopened....for days....so I USED IT!!!  Ladies, it provides a nice shave in the shower.  Contoured handle is non-stick and the thin blades left my legs silky smooth!  If your man is a slacker and leaves his laying around...swipe it!  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I received a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette&lt;br /&gt;These blades can cut through thick hair... including the hair on my head ( for the laughs and giggles).&lt;br /&gt;The precision blade on the back allowed me to edge my beard and side burns... although it is a bit awkward (probably because I am very right hand dependent).&lt;br /&gt;All in all- it is a good blade.</li>
    <li> I am picky about what I can use to shave since my skin is so sensitive and this product takes the cake. I usually have to shave in the shower and with this I can shave immediately!</li>
    <li> this razor is amazing. glides on your face smoothly, no cuts or razor burns. i highly recommend! thank you bzzagent for your sample i will be purchasing some soon!</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp and smooth. You can shave with the grain or against the grain and no irritated skin.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide. It gives a smooth shave with no nicks, last a lot longer then other brands and I can take it into the shower with me. The handle grips well in my hand. I haven&#x27;t dropped it once. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and am very impressed with the design of the handle. You can really grab it securely, it doesn&#x27;t twist and turn when it has soap on it. The blades still seem very sharp too. I skip a day inbetween shaves because I can, because of this razor. Good job Gillette #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> I use an electric razor as my main razor, but sometimes you just need to shave a little closer. Enter the Fusion ProGlide that I got for free through a promotion by Gillette! I was a bit skeptical at first. The last few times I tried using a manual razor, I wound up cutting myself. But not with these blades. There&#x27;s so many blades and the grip on the handle is so good that it&#x27;s practically impossible to cut yourself. And you&#x27;re left with a nice smooth shave that takes a lot longer to grow back than an electric razor. If you&#x27;re looking for a close shave with no cuts, try out these blades.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I receive my free sample of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor (via a program run by Gillette). I thought this razor will probably work the same as every other razor out there, pulling and tugging on my hair. I was wrong! After the first use with the razor I was impressed. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor effortlessly cuts through my tough hair and left me with a smooth, non-irritated shave. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor is the first razor to not give me razor burn. I have continued to use the Proglide Razor for a month and I still get a smooth shave. Gillette has clearly made one of the best hand held razors in the market today.</li>
    <li> I regularly shave with a Fusion razor, so I was interested to try ProGlide. The first shave was good, but not noticeably better than with a regular Fusion blade. I use my blades as long as I can, but the ProGlide blades seemed to go dull (or misalign) faster. Overall, not impressed, and certainly not worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> My quest for a close and comfortable shave has ended.  Thru a program by Gillette I was given a free Fusion ProGlide manual razor, after just a couple uses I am true believer in the product.  Since the razor cartridges/razor has five thinner blades I experienced no tugging or pulling like with other products.  In my usage, it seems that each cartridge lasts a bit longer than the products I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I see, which really isn&#x27;t one if you look at the grand picture, is the cartridges are a bit pricey.  That is a trade off I can live with because they seem to last longer.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual razor is my new go to razor.</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor that I received for free via a program run by Gillette, I found that when I have little facial stubble it tends to get a nice close shave with very little resistance, However when I let my beard grow in a few days when I use the ProGlide I feel that it pulls more then other razors I have used, that being said when I shave every day I felt that this razor did an excellent job of keeping up a smooth shaven look. I just will not use it after a few days without a shave.</li>
    <li> I got this cartridge for free from a program run by Gillette. I Ive never splurged on fancy blades Ive always got cheap ones, but it turns out theres a major difference. Ive been won over. So so smooth.</li>
    <li> I got a free Fusion Proglide razor from Gillette as part of a consumer test panel. This is a great product - I don&#x27;t really like shaving close to the skin, but with the Gillette Fusion Proglide, I can get a smooth shave, and I don&#x27;t get razor burn. My wife is happy, too! Plus, the blades clean up well, so I can save money on the replacement cartridges.</li>
    <li> Very nice blades. My face gets like a sheet of 80 grit sandpaper and these blades cut right through without a snag. I received mine free through a program from Gillette. My schick hydro went straight in the trash</li>
    <li> I used the Gillette razor for the first time (provided for free by a Gillette program) and enjoyed how comfortable it was to shave with and how easy the head was to replace. It shaved very close and was very smooth. I really enjoyed how easy the head was replaceable and the price was very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;I have always used the Gillette brand and the new fusion just confirmed my status as a Gillette man.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for free thru a program run by Gillette This blade is  very smooth! I really like the way it feels to my face when shaving.Since I have started using it, I have not had to shave as often. You can definitely tell that it has the lubricated strip. Happy to have had this opportunity and will definitely continue using this for a long time. Did not have any bad results with this product.It works so great.</li>
    <li> Every time I shave with my Gilette Fusion ProGlide it feels like it&#x27;s pulling the hairs off my face. I tried it multiple times, and each time it&#x27;s been painful. It also seems to be missing spots that I have to go over multiple times to get a clean shave. Before trying the ProGlide I was using the Schick Xtreme 3 disposable razors and I never encountered any issues, in fact, it&#x27;s been difficult to find another razor I like more. I tried the ProGlide because it was provided free via a program run by Gillette, but I&#x27;ll likely be going back to the Schick razors. Overall, I was very disappointed with the razor.</li>
    <li> my thoughts on this cartridge was neutral. the main thing i liked was that it was pretty easy to assemble and disassemble in my opinion. I recieved this free via a promotion that gillette was running so i figured might as well give it a shot. i like the close shave that is given and how smooth i feel after i shave. great cartridge! cant wait to get more refills.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor was provided through a program run by Gillette.  My initial impression of the razor cartridge is overall satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am normally an electric razor kind of guy and finish off with a manual.  However, I must say I am happy to use this particular razor for the full shave.  The blades make a clean cut the first time, rather than having to go over the same area repeatedly.  After several shaves the razor is still cutting fairly well with only slight symptoms of dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer blade is pretty standard, meaning it&#x27;s mildly useful and you should just go to your trusty trimmer.  I used it to clean up the side burns and my chin only to repeat the process again before using my trimmer.  It&#x27;s not a bad precision trimmer, just normal razor trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find the lubrication strip to be quite a nice feature.  It seemed to soothe my skin after the shave and also add a bit of smoothness to the shave as well as my face.  I would rather shave without the shaving cream and just use the razor along with water.  So this strip was an added bonus worth having to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this razor to manual users as you will be happy with the purchase.  I know I was happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like these blades.  It gets a really close shave and I definitely feel the effects of the moisture bar.  However, I think the close shave is just attributed to the amount of blades.  I really like the moisture bar though.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good moisture bar and a close shave.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different blade razors over the years and the Gillette Fusion and now the Proglide are the Cadillac of the disposable cartridge razors.  I received a free Proglide cartridge from Gillette to try, and I must say I&#x27;m as impressed with it as I have been with the regular Fusion cartridge. It actually shaves quicker and smoother than the Fusion and so far it looks like it will last equally as long...maybe longer. Prior to this Proglide, I&#x27;ve been using the Fusion for quite some time.  I find the more blades, the better the shave and the cartridges seem to last for around a month with daily shaving. Try one for yourself and you be the judge.</li>
    <li> I received these blades from a promotion from Gillette.  I normally wouldn&#x27;t buy the blades because they are expensive but they are great.  I would use these again!!</li>
    <li> I received a free razor for a program run by Gillette.  I have been using the Fusion for several years, and was very impressed by the smoother shave I received with the fusion pro-glide.  I have very sensitive skin, so after using a pre-shave oil and the fusion pro-glide I had minimal resistance.  The only downside (and reason I give it four stars) is the life-span of the blade is very short.  After about three shaves I had to switch to a new razor.</li>
    <li> I was given this product to review by a program sponsored by Gillette. I will not mince words: This is a finely crafted razor which allowed me to get the closest shave I have had in forever. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a need to shave. For anyone who might say that the replacement cartridges are a bit high in cost, I was able to get multiple shaves from my cartridge, so it all evens out.</li>
    <li> Having tried more brands and types than I can count on both hands, probably twice over, I am glad to have tried these cartridges.  The best thing about this blade cartridge is that it really works to get a close shave without having to double back and shave against the grain.  With pretty much every other throwaway I have used I would always have to go back and shave over my cheeks because it would just be full of rough stubble.  Not the case with the Proglides.  My skin was smooth on the first pass.  I think the flat design of this head helps to get plenty close to the skin, similar to the approach of a safety razor, whereas other razors sit more at a slant in the cartridge leaving room for that slightly longer stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem it wasn&#x27;t able to solve, however, is the occurrence of razor bumps on my neck.  I have really curly, thick facial hair and it is very prone to growing around and around under the skin with a close shave though it has happened less with these cartridges.  Not a solved problem but definitely an improvement over the Schick I was using previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other glaring con about these cartridges is the price.  Luckily, Gillette was running a program and I was able to try the product for free to see if it was worth purchasing and not have to worry about buyer&#x27;s remorse.  Despite being one of the costliest disposables on the market I would say that it is a product I would buy.  Having a peculiar growth pattern of unrelentingly curly, redwood thick facial hair and finding a blade that can tame it better than the rest I would say I am sold.</li>
    <li> This razor is really great. It works smoothly with not a single snag or grab. The cartridges pop out easily and are doubly easy to put a new one in. The overall look and appeal on the razor is great. The truest test was putting it to use and bam! no razor burn! Awesome. I got this as a promotional freebie from Gillette and they have made a new customer. I won&#x27;t be going back to the razor I was previously using.</li>
    <li> I have recently been able to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual and I have to say that it has been an improvement from my old Mach3 blade. I shave usually before showers (which is not ideal I&#x27;ve been told) and this blade handles even heavy stubble/peachfuzz without having to use a trimmer beforehand. I think the blade should last a little longer between replacements, hence the 4/5.</li>
    <li> I really like how smooth my face felt after using this razor. I sometimes get bumps on my face with other razors and that didn&#x27;t happen with this razor. I was able to shave quickly and effortlessly with this. I plan to use this razor every day to keep my face looking nice and smooth. The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> i received this product to try free from a program offered by gillette. this razor cartridge lasts a long time. its not as good as the power razor, but it still gives a nice clean shave. its costly razors but it worth every penny .will definitely buy in the future</li>
    <li> Ok, so I typically use an electric razor. I decided to give the Gillette Fusion ProGlide a try since I received one for free as part of a program run by Gillette. I figured, that I might get a better shave and that my face should be much smoother. Results? Yes and No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive:&lt;br /&gt;Extremely Sharp Blades-probably one of the closest shaves I have ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;No Drag- I was pretty surprised at how the blades had no drag on my face. No hairs were pulled out, strictly cut. The blade feels as if it forms to your face, so even though the blades are sharp, there were no cuts on my face, and I didn&#x27;t have to pass over the same spot twice.&lt;br /&gt;Quick and Efficient-Didn&#x27;t take me long to shave and I didn&#x27;t even need any shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer Strip - Although it felt nice against my skin, I found the strip starting to peel off after my first shave.&lt;br /&gt;My Skin - This razor reminded me why I switched to electric in the first place. My skin is so sensitive that my face is now covered in razor bumps. Not necessarily blaming the blade. It could just be my fault, but I probably won&#x27;t be using a straight razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as I said in the title, great razor, just not for me.</li>
    <li> After using the Gillette razor that I received free through a Gillette program,  I have to say I am impressed.  The blades gave me such a smooth shave and my wife loves it now when I shave.  The con is that now I have to fight the wife to get MY razor back.  I will be buying more of these cartridge blades for sure.</li>
    <li> Hands down this is the best blade I&#x27;ve ever used. Super smooth shave without any of the hassles I&#x27;m accustomed to. I generally shave once a week just because I loathe the process so much and find that shaving more often than that irritates my skin. But with the Fusion ProGlide blade I feel like I could easily shave more regularly without any problems at all. A little pricey, sure, but ultimately worth it. After all, it&#x27;s your face.</li>
    <li> I have been using an electric razor for about the past 5 years, and having gone back to a manual razor I can see the difference. I recieved this razor from a program run by Gillette, and the cartridge is great for my skin and is such a close shave, way better than my electric razor. This is definitely wife approved and works great. I don&#x27;t think I will be going back any time soon.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver. Works well, close, and clean shave. The handle is hard and comfortable and easy to clean. Well worth the money and highly satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I must say that I really love the blades of the Gillette  Fusion ProGlide! I wondered how it would be different from the regular fusion when I first tried it. The blades glide across my skin so smoothly. I&#x27;m left with an ultra smooth close shave with no razor burn or nicks. I thinks this more gentle with my skin that the regular Fusion is.  This is definitely an upgrade worth buying! I would highly recommend this product for a great shave. This  free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received my glide blades and I Love the pro glide blades. Smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin like other brands that leave my skin bumpy and rough. I and when I smooth, I mean it a smooth shave and leaves the skin smooth just the way I like it. Highly Recommend!!!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Power Razor has the nearly an identical handle and weight although the Fusion ProGlide has slightly larger rubber grips. The Fusion ProGlide&#x27;s power button is a little larger and is illuminated when the razor is on. I liked the fact that the power button on the updated razor is flush with the handle, making it a bit harder to turn on accidentally. While the handle is slightly refined, the real changes are in the shaving cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;The new Fusion ProGlide shaving head is slightly smaller. The bottom section of the head has been redesigned to reduce the number of little rubber fins. This part of the razor is designed to help channel excess shaving cream out of the way, stretch the skin a bit, and lift the hairs for a smoother shave. I think the redesign also helps the razor glide more smoothly over the face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion ProGlide is also using slightly thinner blades. If you compare the standard Fusion head to the Fusion ProGlide cartridge you can notice the blades have a bit more space between them on the new razor. On the backside of the cartridge, you&#x27;ll also notice the blades now rest in a stabilizer to help maintain blade spacing. These changes are designed to allow the razor to glide more smoothly over the face with less drag. My shave was noticeably smoother with the Fusion ProGlide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the Fusion, the Fusion ProGlide comes in both manual and powered version (opt for the power -- it does make a difference) and the powered version includes a low-battery indicator light and automatic shut-off.&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;br /&gt;In my review of the Gillette Fusion, my biggest concern was that the razor produced more drag and irritation than my trusty Gillette Mach 3 Turbo. With the refinements to the new Fusion ProGlide blade, these concerns have been addressed and I&#x27;ve found the Fusion ProGlide gave me the best shave I&#x27;ve had at home with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much Gillette for letting me try this for FREE!!! AMAZING PRODUCT BY AN AMAZING COMPANY! AMAZING PRODUCT BY AN AMAZING COMPANY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a lifelong Mach3 Turbo user and had yet to find a true replacement.  Once I received a free razor, however, of the Fusion Proglide from Gillette, I had to reconsider my next razor purchase.  The Fusion Proglide definitely provides a closer shave, and the trimmer feature is a added benefit!</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program that Gillette has in place. I&#x27;m glad that was the case because after the third shave the razor lost its edge. It works well until the blades wore out. I&#x27;m still looking for a good shave.</li>
    <li> I love this product not to costly not cheap with i love the smoothness of the blades very close shave I will recommend to my friends!!!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Fusion Proglide through the promotional program run by Gillette. I loved it from the very first time I started using it. It was way different from its predecessor, Gillette Fusion. I&#x27;ve never experienced a better and smoother shaving quality and have been using this razor since then. However, a battery powered version is much better, since it requires a lesser effort and has a better constructed blades. Overall, I am very happy with it and highly recommend both manual and battery powered versions.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide and it was exactly as I have come to expect with Gillette... the best shave possible.  I typically use a disposable razor, so using the new Fusion ProGlide blades provided a very close shave in half the time.  Made my disposable razors feel like using a butter knife!</li>
    <li> I was given this razor to try out free by Gillette and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I normally use a quality electric razor but this cuts down my shave time while giving me the really close shave I&#x27;m used to.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone. :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think that the ProGlide was going to be worth the money, but it barely feels like shaving. It just glides across my face.</li>
    <li> This razor is the bomb dot com. It really makes my face feel smooth like a criminal. I would recommend you use this razor to shave wherever you may need to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many 3 and 4 blade razors and I have found this one to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved up and down, round and across and never felt like I was setting myself up for a cut at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job, Gillette!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually pretty impressed with the level of comfort the Fusion Proglide has provided me. For a pretty burly guy I have a sensitive face. This blade makes my shaving experience a bit less annoying and my face seems to be happy about it. It&#x27;s an overall improvement from Gillette&#x27;s last series. I think its worth a shot for anyone to try. Thanks to Gillette for the free Razor Promotion!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for years. Everything always works!!  Prices need to come down alot!!!!!! Perhaps more coupons to make the prices more affordable</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed these new razors from Gillette! In the past I&#x27;ve had problems with irritation from other razors, but with these that has not been an issue. I&#x27;m satisfied 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide cartridge for free via a program run by Gillette and I was thoroughly impressed.  Such a close shave and left absolutely no razor bumps.  love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best razor i have ever used and i recommend it to any one. My wife also has one that she uses.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a programs from Gillette I receive a free fusion proglide and I have to say that it is and extraordinary blade. I&#x27;m no used to shave on a daily basis but y always had use blades that usually don&#x27;t last much, usually like 2 or 3 time of use. With five sharp blades shave me is extremely comfortable. At shaving me with my regular blade the pulls on the hair was uncomfortable and painful leaving tiny cuts and irritating my skin but whit the fusion progilde the pulls has been reduce to a minimum that is doesn&#x27;t leave any cuts or irritation on the skin. Since my facial hair is very thick this blade doesn&#x27;t lost the sharp fast like my old blades, I have use it a lot since I receive it and still like new.</li>
    <li> Gillette provided me with this product to try out and test for free. I thought the blades were excellent really. Very close shave. I got no nicks at all. However the blade head itself is a little too thick for me. I have some close spots where I need a smaller head and it is just a little too big. But the blades are great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a while now, but was given a free cartridge to try as part of a campaign by Gillette.  I really enjoy the shave it provides, as it gives a close shave with very little irritation.  However, they claim the razors should last a while without needing a replacement.  I usually shave about 3 times per week, and I find that within 3 weeks I need to replace the cartridge.  So that&#x27;s about 9-10 shaves.  I usually wait longer than that to replace them because the cartridges are so expensive - I&#x27;d be buying new packs all the time.  Overall, a pretty solid product if you&#x27;re willing to drop the cash for replacement cartridges.</li>
    <li> I love these Gillette Fusion Proglide Cartridges. they are super easy to clip onto the handle and they are sharp and smooth. they leave my face feeling smooth and happy.</li>
    <li> First off I have incredibly sensitive skin so when I received the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor from a Gillette program I was excited to say the least.  The blades give an extremely close shave, but there is still a little tugging when I shave.  I noticed that there is supposed to be \\&quot;anti-clogging\\&quot; rinse slots, but the blades did clog occasionally which forced me to stop and clean the them.  I did notice some razor burn the next day, but nothing too bad.</li>
    <li> After getting the Fusion Proglide razor free via a Gillette program, I was able to give a try. I was surprised it performed so well. The blades just cut right through the facial hair and leaves the face sooooooo smooth. My new favorite razor to use these days :) very happy guy</li>
    <li> After shaving for years, and having 4 blade razors yank all my hair out when they got the slightest bit dull, I was ready for something better. Then I tried the proglide cartridges and I will not be going back to the other guys! No tug, no pull, no little pieces of toilet paper! These blades stay much sharper, longer than any other blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I received a sample from a program sponsored by Gillete to try this razor. The blades worked great. They were very thin and the cooling gell made this one of the closest shaves without razor burn I&#x27;ve ever had. Only problem is the price on these is a little steep but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of the Gillette brand and really loved this particular razor and think it is the very best yet.  I got a very smooth shave and it stood up to all of my expectations and more.</li>
    <li> I love these razors because they don&#x27;t leave me with razor burn like others do. I have sensitive skin so its nice to finally have a razor that leaves my skin smooth and burn free. They also shave close to the point were I don&#x27;t have to shave as much which is a HUGE bonus</li>
    <li> I recently obtained a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide blade cartridge that was provided by Gillette and and am mixed on it. The best feature of this product in my experience is that less hair becomes stuck in the crevices between the blades. It was nice to not have to worry about cleaning out clogged hair. Unfortunately, the cutting power of the blades did not leave my face unscathed. There was resistance as I moved the blades across my face. It was not too bad when shaving daily, but after not shaving for a few days the blade had a hard time with my hair. I have soft skin and thick hair so the blade may work better for the thick-skinned or thin of hair. Unfortunately, I suffered razor burn and many cuts on my upper neck/beneath my chin. I found that the medicated strip did not help much. Overall I was not impressed by this product outside of the non-clogging blades. It wasn&#x27;t a horrible product, but it did not suit my needs very well.</li>
    <li> these blades give the closest shave i have ever had....my wife loved feeling my face so soft and smooth. i will use this product for a long time. i havent found any other razor i like as much as this one. the no slip grip is great no slipping while i shave.</li>
    <li> By far one of the best blades I have used. Although the razors are fairly expensive to refill they last much longer and come far more sharp than bargain brands. The only comment I need to make is about the trimming (+1) blade the razor has. While it is great at what it is intended for, I caught my lip on an \\&quot;up stroke\\&quot; and cut it pretty badly. Definitely user error though.</li>
    <li> What a great razor. It provided a much closer shave with no razor burn at all! Even against the grain it worked great. I was thoroughly impressed. The precision trimmer was such a great feature for hard to reach places like under my nose. I was very impressed with this product and I will definitely be purchasing replacement blades once this one that I got from a free program run by Gillette gets dull.</li>
    <li> I shave about every three days and when I do always rely on the Gillette Fusion Blades. I&#x27;ve noticed with these blades that i get a smoother shave a across from my face and it seems the it cuts deeper which is a plus. Ive never gotten razor burn and this is the main reason why i rely on these blades. They do the job without any burning or rarely a nick on my face! The only problem I have with these razors are the prices to replace them. Otherwise, I always use Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual razor to try through a program Gillette was hosting &amp; used it a few times in one week &amp; in my opinion it gives the closest smoothest shave of any razor I&#x27;ve ever used. It should be noted that I generally shave almost every day for my job &amp; with the disposable razors I use, it sometimes takes up to 10 minutes (+ or -) to shave closely &amp; completely. However, the first few times I used the Proglide razor it took me less than 5 minutes. I had also run out of shaving cream prior to using it but it didn&#x27;t knick, cut or pull at all. I was personally impressed with how fast &amp; close the shave was. I was able to get about 5 consecutive days of use out of the blades that came with the razor. I was also off work for 3 days &amp; didn&#x27;t shave but when I did shave after that 3 days I still had no major issues so I actually got about 6 days of use out of the blades, though the blades were getting a little dull by that point. I think I will invest in the blade refills as much as I can instead of relying on disposable razors as the quality of the blades are worth the extra money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> As I shaved my face this morning using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge, it was noticably smooth on my face.  And my wife deffinatly how smooth it made my face feel, and it stayed smooth longer than my usual blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this free from Gillette as a sample.</li>
    <li> These blades might be pricey but from my experience Gillette products do a better job at shaving and last a reasonable amount of time compared to cheaper brands. I received one of these blades free as part of a program from Gillette but I can honestly say I would buy more because they work so well. The lubrastrip is also one of my favorite additions to the razor since it helps lubricate as you shave.</li>
    <li> I am so happy Gillette chose me for this program and sent me these razors.  They do an awesome job and are really smooth and sensitive on my scan.  I most say I was pleasantly surprised.  I am ready to keep going with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades!!!</li>
    <li> This product works great. My hubby loves to shave with only this razor. It&#x27;s the smoothest shave he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette razors for as long as I have been shaving but recently I changed over to Schick because they were a little cheaper. Gillette sent me this new razor to try it out for free and I have to say that I love them! Smooth action, close shave. Can&#x27;t beat em&#x27;. After I run out of the other kind I will be switching back to Gillette!</li>
    <li> The new Gillette fusion proglide is awesome!  I have really sensitive skin and seems that most razors I use leaves me with a nasty razor burn or I get nicked a lot, but the Gillette Fusion Proglide is not that way! I would definately have to recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.  It is by far the best manual razor system that I have used to date.</li>
    <li> I tried this razor after receiving a free trial through Gillette and I have to say that after using it a few times it is my new razor of choice. It gave me a shave that was close but did not give me the same tug and pull that I got from razors in the past. This is by far the best razor I have ever used. Do your face a service and try it out!</li>
    <li> Years ago, I learned a very important lesson - razors made for men are WAY BETTER than razors made for women.  To the ladies out there, trust me.  Once you use a man&#x27;s razor, you&#x27;ll never go back.  At least, I never did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the ladies (guys, sorry for the \\&quot;lady\\&quot; talk)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors are wonderful.  They leave my legs feeling really smooth and they provide a closer shave than any other razor I have tried.  These blades extend the amount of time that I can go in between shaves.  They are also great when it comes to the delicate skin of my underarms and bikini line (again, sorry to the guys out there!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still get occasional razor burn when I shave frequently, or fail to replace the blade soon enough.  But, for the most part, these blades give me the best (and longest lasting) shave of any other blade I have tried (and, I have tried a lot of them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to replace the blades pretty quickly for the best performance.  But, again, I use them for my legs (a larger area than a man&#x27;s mustache or beard area).  My husband also uses these blades and he can go quite a while using the same blade before noticing a degradation on performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story, short: These blades are great for men and women!</li>
    <li> This product gave me a great shave. Have used just about every Gillette blade ever made over the years. Also used a few Schick but Gillette is the way to go! Gave me a great shave, very smooth during and after. Vibration will take a little adjustment but it will be worth it.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide for free and thought I would try it. I have senitive skin and the first thing I found was my skin was not stinging. Then as I used it there was no pulling or tuging as I shaved. After I saw no red splotches and my skin was soft and smooth not rough. the first couple of times I used it was great, but after the 3rd time it started to pull and tug. But overall I really like the blades.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor cartridge via a program from Gillette and it is absolutely wonderful. These blades offer a super smooth shave and I was even able to dry shave without a problem or those nasty red razor burn bumps.I would highly recommend this razor to anyone who wants a quick shave without the razor burn.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Cartridge was given to me for free through a program with Gillette. It is far better than the electric razor I used for a long time. With my thick, dark beard it is very important to me to have a smooth, close shave. The Fusion Proglide delivers this. It allows me to skip a day without look very unshaven. The smoother shave and the fact that I can shave less often has been better for my skin.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide cartridges as a part of a promotional program through Gillette. I found these to be average blades, nothing too special as far as refill cartridges are concerned. I have tried many different types of razor blade cartridges, and I don&#x27;t see any difference in these than any of the others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really digging this new razor blade system. It didn&#x27;t tug or pull any of my facial hair and really made the whole shaving experience painless.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely switching to Gillette. Especially since 12 hours after shaving my face still feels pretty smooth. I might only have to shave every 3 days instead of 2 with my old razor which I really love! I&#x27;m glad I participated in this free razor blade program from Gillette.</li>
    <li> The blades are some what costly. but work well. I&#x27;ve used the Fusion for some time now so I when BzzAgent.com sent me the ProGlide to try for free I was happy to try it out. My facial hair is thick so most razors don&#x27;t work well for me. I tried several brands before settling on my Fusion. The Proglide provides me with a slightly smoother shave than my old Fusion. I like the fact that my old Fusion handle is also interchangeable with my Proglide cartridges. It&#x27;s overall a great system, although a bit costly. I&#x27;ll be sticking with it from now on.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for free thru a program run by Gillette and man am I glad I was chosen. This blade is so smooth! I literally had to check that it was even shaving the hairs because it felt so smooth. I really like the way it conforms to my face when I am on the jaw line and chin areas. Another really great thing I noticed about this blade is that since I have started using it, I have not had to shave as often. You can definitely tell that it has the lubricated strip, but it doesn&#x27;t feel slimy like I have experienced with some of the others. My wife has even been sneaking my razor lately! Really happy to have had this opportunity and will definitely continue using this for a long time.</li>
    <li> After receiving a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide via a program run by Gillette, I waited a while to post a review so I could get a proper aspect of how the blades would hold up and I&#x27;ve been more than happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest pro: It cuts very well and leaves my face smooth. Hardly any cuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest con: Sometimes the hairs would get stuck in the blades even after trying to wash them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely buy the same razor again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Every time Gillette releases a new razor, it appears to be better than the last and this razor is no exception.  This razor is extremely close and comfortable and left no irritation.  Don&#x27;t have any hesitation getting this product as it really is the best shave you can get.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this razor. I have tried more than my fair share of different products and this is by far the best I have tried. I have been using it for about a month now every day to two days and the blades have not dulled or rusted. It has held up to the previous reviews I read before trying this product. I recommend this product to anyone who has had problems finding a good quality razor at a great price!!</li>
    <li> i Got the chance to try the new Proglide cartridges through a promotion from Gillette and i must say that the new razor is a big improvement over the previous fusion cartridges. I don&#x27;t really know if the blades are thinner or not but i do know that i get a better shave. i have very sensitive skin and when i use the old fusion razor i have a red face for several hours that hurts the whole time.this new razor seems to \\&quot;glide\\&quot; over my chin and neck better and leave less irritation. another big plus is cleaning the razor. it has a big gap that allows you to run water through it easier and get all the hair out. The razor does have a thicker lotion pad and i am sure that helps with less irritation. the head bends the same as the old razor but with the improvements to the blades and such my face is a much happier camper when all is said and done. if you likes the old fusion cartridges you will love these proglide cartridges.</li>
    <li> I was given a Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge as part of a program run by Gillette. I have used Gillette razor products for years, but had not used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide until now. I have sensitive skin and have tried other competing products to no avail. I have always been satisfied with Gillette&#x27;s line of razors/blades, and the Fusion ProGlide was no exception. In this review, I will be specifically concentrating on the cartridge. The cartridge has 5 super sharp blades and a lubricating strip. On the opposite, top side of a razor, there is a single razor blade for those little details (side burns, mustache/beard lines, etc...). Althought these features are not new, they have definitely been improved in this product. The name of the product does not fall short... this razor glides through your face smoothly and causes little, or no irritation on my skin. It allows for a quick shave without the fear of bleeding. The only bad thing about this razor is that as they say, all good things must come to an end, and after two or three weeks of use, it is time to change the cartridge. I have not used a better product.</li>
    <li> i received a free Gillette fusion proglide razor through a program run by Gillette. i have been using this razor for close to a month now and i use it everyday. i tend to run late most mornings and have found it saves time showering and shaving together. i can hardly believe it myself but i am still using the original cartridge that it came with! that is really something special. the razor blades are thin and the moisture strips on both sides of the 5 blades keeps chafing to a minimum and leaves my skin smooth and soft. i will have to replace the cartridge soon but being able to use it for such a long time saves me time and money. it can be very expensive to buy replacement blades and this is the first razor i have owned that i got a month of use out of just one cartridge. the cartridge replacements are a bit costly but when you consider that you won&#x27;t be having to change it so often it ends up being more than reasonably priced. at this rate ill only have to buy 2 refill packs of 6 for the upcoming year and that means a lot during these hard economic times. i give this cartridge a 4 out of 5 stars solely because of the expense of those cartridge replacements. i do not have a really heavy or course beard so the fact that i can get through a month with just one, others with heavier beards will probably have to change their blades more often. other than that i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a close shave that can be used in the shower safely and a clean and soft face! thanks for making a great razor Gillette!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with Gillette Fusion Proglide. It is comfortable shave. The 5 blade are thinner but they get the job done. I got this product for free for a tester. The blades are sharp and provide a nice smooth shave with minimal skin cuts.  Skin remains smooth with close hair removal to skin. I am very happy with this product, would definitely recommended to everybody.</li>
    <li> These are the real thing and not cheap copies .... best blades I have ever used</li>
    <li> I received this free razor provided via a program run by Gillette to try out and give my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how the razor shaves and the felling i get after. It&#x27;s a good cartridge but i would use it every other time for the reason i don&#x27;t want to wear out the cartridge out, and having too pay $23 to $30.</li>
    <li> I work for an international oncology education company, so I always need to look my best when working on site with doctors from all around the world. I brought this razor on a recent 8 day trip and used it everyday. Most blades I would replace every other day or every three days, but this one lasted the whole 8 days! Top quality and an overall great shave</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette that provided the free razor via a program run by Gillette. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Blade is the best on sensitive skin. The blades have less to no tug and pull compare to other blades I have had in the past. The blade does glade across the skin with the new reformulated lubrication strip. Great shave ever time and no the blades don&#x27;t last forever I wish it did to save on cost. The blades are easy to change. I was very happy with this blade and you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this blade.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Pro Fusion cartridges are one of the best shaving products I have used. They stay sharp through many shaves and are easy to clean! Both requirements of a razor I purchase.</li>
    <li> I received a free Fusion ProGlide razor via a program run by Gillette, I normally use this brand for my shaving needs. Gillette  seems to have improved the blades by making them thinner, which to me makes it smoother than what I am used to. Normally after a few shaves, it starts to tug, but not with the new blades.</li>
    <li> Got a free trial of the blades. Am very happy with the razors. Does not clog. The closest shave. I usually use Gillette sensor blades; but these are better. Will purchase from now on.</li>
    <li> I was lucky to have received this razor to try free through a program sponsored by Gillette.  As soon as I used it, I was impressed with the precision with which the blades cut.  I shave every evening, so, while I don&#x27;t ever deal with thick heavy growth on my face, I do need a cartridge I can use daily without having to replace it weekly, as the replacement cartridges are pretty costly.  I found with this razor, the blades showed no significant dullness in the first 3 weeks.  After that, I noticed a little bit more resistance, but the cartridge powered through another week before I knew it had to be replaced.  I have used the Gillette Fusion before, and while it worked similarly, I still give this ProGlide the nod.  These are super thin blades that shave even the finest whiskers.  There is no need to ever go back over any patch of skin, after the initial glide.  I would definitely recommend these to anybody who enjoys an easy quick shave!</li>
    <li> I received these cartridges for free via a program run by gillette. I tested this product and really liked it. It provides a nice smooth shave closer to the skin but without any cuts or irritation. I really liked the lubrastrip it made shaving much easier and I didn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream. The Gillette Fusion Proglide is a must have for every man.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend...I feel less drag when cutting the hairs using Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridges and with irritation on my sensitive skin. The blades last a long time and cut incredibly close! I usually shave every two or three days and can&#x27;t remember the last time I changed the cartridge with the exact same performance as a new. Although the razors were provided on a program by Gillette I would have no hesitation purchasing myself.</li>
    <li> I was given one of these to try for free through a Gillette program. I had used the Fusion before, but not the proglide. I didn&#x27;t really expect much difference, but was pretty surprised. I found my stubble came in later in the day than it used to, as I have to be at work early and have thick, black Italian hair. Usually around 2pm I would start feeling like I should shave again, but not with these. I also really like the moisture strip, it leaves my face soft and smooth, which makes the wife happy. I don&#x27;t have nearly as many nicks and cuts or irritation wither. I haven&#x27;t tried the hair dryer trick that another reviewer mentioned, but I do towel dry it after I am done.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided free via a program run by Gillette.The blades give a close shave with no irritation or friction. The overall shave is close and comfortable. Works better and smoother than moc 3, which i held on to for years.</li>
    <li> Versus the Previous Fusion blade.  I HAve a think Coarse Irish beard, the Newer thinner blades make short work of the under the neck and allow closer in sculpting.  The new Fusion Proglide also cuts back on irritation, so I don&#x27;t break out like I did with the Previous Fusion Blades.  I recieved mine as part of a set From Gillette 3 weeks ago, and let me tell you- It still works good as new!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from the Gillette program! Firstly I&#x27;d like to say that I have been using Gillette razors for some time, just not this kind. I like the 5 blades it has and it gives a nice smooth shave, even pivots which is nice. The lubricating strip isn&#x27;t enough I feel, for my face, so I add shaving gel. The blades are close, so it gives a close shave. I rate this razor a 4, because I still like electric razors a little more!</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge , beat all the others that they have made , nice smooth shave with out skin irratation , or any other problems , i would recommend this to all men who shave  with a razor . I tried this cartridge via a program run by Gillette, TYVM !</li>
    <li> My facial hair grows tremendously fast, so much so that I will shave twice a day if I plan on going out for the night. If I go more than 24 hours without shaving, the tugging from the razor is usually painful and uncomfortable at best. I decided to put this to a true test and used it for the first time to shave after 3 days without doing so. 3 days for me is the average man&#x27;s week. I lathered up wand to my surprise, it was as smooth as if I had just finished shaving mintues before. It took of a solid 3 minutes of shaving time and left me with nothing along the lines of a razor burn, just a baby face. After repeated uses, the experience is not quite as perfect, but still much better than previous razors. Although I got a sample razor provided free via a program run by Gillettefor how long each cartridge will last, it&#x27;s more than worth it it&#x27;s price for a product I&#x27;ll use every day.</li>
    <li> I received a razor via a free program run by Gillette and I must say that it is a pretty damn good razor.  I have previously used the Fusion and the ProGlide feels alot smoother and, when dry-shaving, doesn&#x27;t catch or snag on the hairs like most other razors did.  It has a little trouble with the thicker-hair(as all razors do) but works flawlessly if you trim regularly. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that needs a high-quality shaver!</li>
    <li> it is absolutely easy to use . no worry about getting shave cuts from the blades because the way it was design made it very safe  to use</li>
    <li> I got to try a free sample from Gillette and having previously used the original fusion have found that this is a much better razor. The original did provide a nice shave but it also had some resistance which would make shaving uncomfortable. This newer model gives a nice smooth shave, the thinner blades definitely make a difference.</li>
    <li> Great cartridge, lasts for almost a month. More expensive up front, but you have to replace it less often, and it makes for a much better shave in the end. Definitely five stars.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor from Gillette, I must say I was excited to try it out. My shaving habits consist of shaving my head and my face. The razor cartridge has five blades on the main shaver and a single blade on the side of the cartridge to use for trimming, which was useful for me as I have a goatee. Also, above the main razor is a lubrastrip which provides additional lubrication while you shave. This is very helpful, especially for people with sensitive skin such as myself as it helps reduce friction and irritation. Using the Fusion ProGlide has given me the closest, smoothest shave I have ever experienced. Also I had no irritation at all, unlike with other razors I would have shaving bumps and skin blotches. The five blades also help in reducing irritation. I would highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for all of your shaving needs, especially if you shave your head like I do!</li>
    <li> I received this razor thru a bzzcampaign as a bzzagent. I tried this razor and it gave a close shave and it left my face smooth. The second day i used this razor the blades went dull fast.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide that was provided via a program run by Gillette and really liked it.  The blades are costly but coupons and sales could bring down the price.  It provided a good close shave and the blades didn&#x27;t rust as quick as some of the other blades I have tried.</li>
    <li> The blades are only good/average, which is great since I received them through a program run by Gillette. They would probably rate higher if my beard did not grow in many directions. I tend to go through these a little faster than your \\&quot;Average Joe\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Having tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide against my regular razor blades, I noticed that the Proglide gave me a closer, and more comfortable, shave.  I thought perhaps the thinner blades would be less efficient, but it was just the opposite, and I believe the thinner blades caused less irritation that my regular shaving blades.  I have no red bumps or ingrown hairs using this razor.  I also had no nicks or cuts using the Proglide, compared to having at least one nick or cut every other day with my normal blades.  These are going to be my new razor blades of choice!</li>
    <li> I switched to a safety razor a few months ago, and recently had the opportunity to try this razor out for free. I was not impressed. The cartridges are easy to swap out and the razor feels nice and high quality, but the shave itself was a bit painful. Not just once either. I thought it was just a fluke the first time, but it kept happening. The shave quality wasn&#x27;t great either. Do yourself a favor and get a safety razor. You&#x27;ll save money not having to buy these overpriced cartridges and get a better shave too.</li>
    <li> Was not impressed, shaved like a run of the mill razor these days.  Definitely not worth all the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend this specifically over another competitors.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a promotion through Gillette. I thought the initial shave using the fusion proglide blade was awesome, extremely close and left my skin feeling very smooth, I found myself looking forward to shaving each morning. However, I was disappointed in the blades longevity, it seems that by the end of the week the blades seem to be tugging at my facial hair and my face doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as it did initially. Overall if you have fine facial hair then you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem, but for those of us with corse facial hair, myself included, the blades seem to wear out too quickly.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product via program ran by gillette. This is a great razor. It gives me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. No irrattion or burning feeling after use. Only time I could shave is right out of the shower but with this razor I only have to moisten my face and shave.</li>
    <li> I was able to try a free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette and my opinion on it is that this is the best razor out there. The blades are so smooth and the cartridge has 4 main blades on one side and then 1 blade on the other side to help get certain spots. After every shave my face feels nice and smooth. I love this product and will never by another kind of razor again.</li>
    <li> I have tried the new Gillette Fusion and love the handle because it is has great balance.  It really gives a close shave. I used to use an electric razor and now I am converted.</li>
    <li> it was great smooth shave with n o nicks, I even just used it with only water and had no problems..nice close shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Gillette products but I truly think the Fusion Proglide razor is the best. The shave was very close, was easy to handle, glided right through and left my skin nick-free and smooth. I have to shave everyday for work and this manual razor has been able to give the best shave compared to other manual razors. I recommend that men at least try it once because you will agree it&#x27;s the best too.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free and it was provided via a program run by Gillette! The smoothest shave I ever had. The blades did not irritate my skin at all. They also lasted along time. i would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have seen these razors advertised with men using them, but they are excellent for females too!!! I do not need to shave everyday as I did with other razors...their great!!!</li>
    <li> The product works wonders for my skin, i love the fact it contours around my sking when i shave.I only wish the blade lasted a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion is the smoothest shave Ive ever had and it is easier to clean the  hairs out from in between the blades. Great Razor!</li>
    <li> I got this free razor provided via a program run by Gillette. This razor has 5 blades for a close clean shave. I like how the blades dont pull or tug but it gently glides over my face. I use to get razor bumps with the old razors ive used. This one doesnt give me razor bumps.</li>
    <li> I received a free trial blade in the mail from Gillette to test out this product. The blade themselves always gave me a close shave, however, it irritated my face half of the time. The lotion strip comes off at a faster rate than Gillette&#x27;s main competitor. It is a great blade if you don&#x27;t have a tender face.</li>
    <li> After using the Proglide Razor for about four weeks, I have found that the blades continue to give me the same smooth shave that I got the first time I used this razor. A close, clean shave every time, with a minimum of shaving cream. The handle is easy to grip and makes it easy to control shaving around my chin and nose. I have had no cuts or scrapes from using this razor.</li>
    <li> I used to think any razor could the the trick when it came to shaving.  I even used the disposable kinds until I was left bleeding in multiple parts of my face.  That is until recently when I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual cartridge for free from a program Gillette was running.  The razors are so thin you barely know you are shaving.  That is until you see your smooth face.  The multiple razor blades allow for an efficient shave with just one swipe.  No irritation or cuts once so ever.  The best part is that they last about a month so you don&#x27;t have to she&#x27;ll put a load of cash for razors.  I highly recommend you try for yourself.  You will be impressed.</li>
    <li> I got this baby for free through a campaign run by Gillette. At first I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve read reviews that said that Gillette blades aren&#x27;t that great and stuff but when I tried these razor they went through my skin so smoothly and I was surprised that all my hair was shaved in one stroke. Don&#x27;t believe what others say, this razor is very good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of reusable razors before. Normally whatever is on sale when i need a new one. After trying this when I received it as a freebie to test and review, I am hooked. I have course hair and sensitive skin. This razor gave me a close shave and 1 and 2 days after using it I had significantly less bumps than I would have with other razors I&#x27;ve tried. The blades glide over my face without catching on my skin and hair. I enjoyed the experience.</li>
    <li> I have tried every razor on the market! Eveytime a new one co.es out I am the first to try it so of course I was excited to try the Gillete Fusion Proglide! I have very coarse hair and usually have to shave twice just to get that nice clean shave feeling. Well this is the first razor that actually goy through my hair the dirst time every time! I would highky rexommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received one of these blades and a handle through a promotional campaign run by Gillette and I was impressed with the blade from the initial shave.&lt;br /&gt;This blade is very smooth for the first few shaves, but I feel like the thinner blades that Gillette is so proud of tend to dull faster than the traditionally thicker ones on their other razors such as the Mach 3. In my experience, the blade dulled before the lubricating strip faded and I would honestly say I do not have a particularly thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this, I do like the blade but when I do wish to purchase I would most likely go to Costco where they can be found slightly more reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great blade compared to the many others out there.</li>
    <li> these had to be the easiest cartridges to change out on any razor I have ever owned. Close shave and clean.</li>
    <li> The razor was provided to me free of charge, by a program run by Gillette. The shave is very smooth. The handle fits nicely into the hand and is comfortable to use. The swiveling head is very easy to shave with except for on the chin, where it needs getting used to. I really enjoyed using the razor. I have not gotten a single cut in the few weeks I have been using this razor, which is a huge plus in my case.</li>
    <li> I am in the military so I have to shave everyday. My skin was constantly feeling irritated. I got a free sample and tried it out. The blades are thinner than the other razors I had been using and I found that it gave me a closer shave without as much irritation. It didn&#x27;t take the irritation away completely but it helped and because it was such a close shave sometimes I was able to get away with not shaving everyday. A great item for care packages.</li>
    <li> i received this product to try free from a program offered by gillette. this razor cartridge lasts a long time. its not as good as the power razor, but it still gives a nice clean shave. will definitely buy in the future.</li>
    <li> I received this razor &amp; cartridge free from a program run by Gillette. It gives a nice smooth shave and it has a nice lubricating strip which surprisingly works really well even after many uses. I get no razor burn whatsoever. The cartridge has lasted twice as long as other brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I will continue to use this even after the program has ended. My wife says she loves my nice baby-smooth skin!</li>
    <li> One of the better shaves I&#x27;ve gotten out of a disposable razor blade. I recommend this to anyone looking to make a switch from their current razor. Zero razor burn, and shaves down to the root. I even use it to shave my head, and it&#x27;s smooth. I only shave every other day due to sensitive skin, and this blade does such a good job no one can tell.</li>
    <li> It all depends on what type of shaver you are (electric razor versus the more traditional types), but for people who like these types of razors, this blade arrangement is quite decent. It would have gotten a 5 from me if different things about it were more customizable (the angle, the spacing, etc). I got it for free from a program that Gillette was doing, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I received a package of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridges for free through a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I normally have a full beard, I decided to use the new blades along with the onset of warmer weather to go clean shaven for awhile. The blades cut through my beard amazingly well, and the lubrication strip prevented the irritation that I normally experience while shaving. Even so, due in part to the cost of the blades, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m swayed enough in my need of a good shave to alter my normal routine and buy these in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Gillette products in the past, as well as Schick, and actually have an array of blade handles to choose from. I was most recently using the Schick Titanium and the Gillette Fusion. )The Proglide gives a nice, close shave. The blades glide very easily, even in those awkward spots, like over the jawline and chin.The blade rinses easily--this is a big plus, at least in my book. I can&#x27;t stand blades that clog and it&#x27;s a chore to rinse them free of build-up. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge difference between the results I get with the Proglide and the Fusion--so far, the Proglide blades seem to just be more expensive.In comparison to the Titanium, definitely a closer, more smooth shave with little to no irritation.And the blades rinse free much,much more easily than the Titanium, as well. In the end, Proglide is a great,close,smooth ,irritation-free shave--at least for me-- just a bit too expensive, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Im more of an electric razor type of guy. This Razor works great for those who have sensitive skin. I used it with just regular body/face soap and the razor and it works great with no razor burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last just as long as any other razor.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Cartridge was provided by a program run by Gillette.  The program allowed me to sample the product to form an opinion on it.  I think that these cartridges are excellent and provide a nice shave!  They&#x27;re very easy to place into the handle and provide a clean shave for many uses.  I think that that this product is great and I would recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> These are cheaper than buying at the store and the quality of the blades are always good.</li>
    <li> save your money and buy a double edge razor and blades you get the same shave but at 1/8th the cost</li>
    <li> So for about the past 20 years I&#x27;ve been using an electric razor, different brands but lately its been a braun.  When I first started shaving with a regular razor all those years ago I used to get terrible razor burn and my bloody neck looked like I had recently come from a violent crime, so I switched to electric.  The shave wasn&#x27;t as close of course, but it was comfortable with no burn.  Fast forward to this past year when braun changed the materials they use in their replacement blades, its like they switched from steel to recycled aluminum and the result is razor burn AND a shave that isn&#x27;t as close.  People on the amazon review of the replacement blades have been referring to it as Razorgeddon.  Millions of users left alone in the night, with hairy faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So because of this I started checking out &#x27;modern&#x27; regular razors and the gillette fusion seemed to do an ok job.  the innovation of a vibrating blade I think helps a lot.  Of course it sounds a little scary, but it adds something, helping to saw through facial hair.  I started using these and the shave was good, but there was still a fair amount of burn.  Now comes these new thinner ProGuide blades and combined with the fusion vibration they are AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I had a shave with a regular razor with no burn and no cuts, not a single one.  Check them out on your next blade rotation.  the refill blades DO work on the original fusion handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for something that would give a better shave, and when I saw this product advertised, I had to try it; I wasn&#x27;t too confident on it working as advertised, but I was more than surprised and pleased with it that I went and got one for My Brother.&lt;br /&gt;But the quality of the first blades to hit the stores was way better than the latest ones(it&#x27;s usually that way, the put out a great product and then They cut back on quality to make a few cents!) it&#x27;s not as smooth a shave as the first ones I bought, but overall they do provide a better shave than most of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve signed up for recurring shipments of it, and until something better(doubtful!) comes out I&#x27;ll keep on using it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> When I first heard the ProGlide was coming out, I was a bit skeptical on how it could be that much better than the regular Fusion.  As is turned out, the ProGlide is better and noticeably so.  There is definitely much less resistance when sliding this across my face.  It also seems like I&#x27;m been getting a closer shave.  The best part of the ProGlide is that your can use your old Fusion handles to attach the blades onto.  No need to buy special ProGlide handles.  The only bad part that I have noticed so far is that the ProGlide seems to wear down much faster than the old Fusion.  I have to replace the ProGlide blades about a week earlier than I used to with the old Fusion.</li>
    <li> These razors are the best I have ever used...until you have used them 4 times, then they cut your face to pieces. It is well known that Gillette&#x27;s razors are designed to provide an excellent shave that doesn&#x27;t last so that you have to buy more razors, these are no exception. I go through 8 razors per month, so it is nice that they are so cheap here. They are really good razors at first, and for me, the cost of replacing them frequently is worth it.</li>
    <li> great shave to begin with. . .but they dull quickly. Plus, I am convinced the ones from Amazon aren&#x27;t as good. the conditioning strip comes completely off sometimes. maybe they sit in a hot warehouse too long?</li>
    <li> I saved a few dollars and that is worth it.  It is surprising some of the things I can buy on Amazon and how much I can save when buying them.  Thanks and highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Great price for my favorite blades.</li>
    <li> I am basing my review on my husband&#x27;s review.  He asked me to buy one for him and after checking out prices, I bought from Amazon cause it was the best price.  My husband loves it.  Thinks it is much better than razors he&#x27;s used, very happy with it.</li>
    <li> They last a lot longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I could do without the blade on the back side.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this razor.  The refills tend to be pricey, but they last and make the skin feel smooth after shaving.</li>
    <li> great blades esp with the new ball razor. i don&#x27;t think i would get a better deal elsewhere  esp after coupon.  thanks amazon</li>
    <li> Great price. Works as expected. I use these until they are rusted. Seems like by the fourth shave they dull up and stay about the same for the next 20 or so shaves. Fine for a guy like me that feels no pain from duller blades and just needs a &amp;#34;rugged outdoors&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> Good product, and much cheaper than retail local stores.</li>
    <li> Great razor! Very smooth and offers a clean and close shave. No problems with it at all.</li>
    <li> Works, but expensive....</li>
    <li> ive tried everything to help decrease irritation as least as possible i switched to these and im satisfied on how good they work.you feel less drag when cutting the hairs and i hardly get bumps since i switched. they last pretty long i usually shave every two or three days and its been almost a month and i havent changed it yet and they still work pretty good they are pretty expensive so i try to make them last but in the store theyre almost 30 somewhat dollars for eight. (i know they&#x27;re good but damn) I found them on here for 10 bucks cheaper and theyre delivered pretty fast will definitely purchase them on here for now on ...</li>
    <li> service was fast, item was as ordered, good product, could be less expensive.  It provides the most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> My husband says these are the very best razors for shaving his head...no blood...and that&#x27;s a good thing! He looked pretty awful when he had band-aids all over his head when he used his old style of blades. Much improvement!</li>
    <li> A bit pricey but you pay for what you get</li>
    <li> Great blade nice smooth close shave.</li>
    <li> Best blades you can buy.</li>
    <li> very nice clean shave</li>
    <li> My go to blade. Can&#x27;t top it IMHO.</li>
    <li> the buyer should be prepared to pay for the quality.  Other than the price, I love this razor because of the close shave and little face irritation.</li>
    <li> Great price! best blades and razor ever</li>
    <li> I could have bought this at CVS, did not get the actual razor holder</li>
    <li> They were NOT real Fusion blades.  Amazon is letting way too many products through that are inferior knock-offs.  Real fusion blades work great, this did not.  Would like my money back.</li>
    <li> The blades don&#x27;t last as long as they used to few years ago.</li>
    <li> These blades provide a shave that is both close and pretty comfortable... for the first few uses.  After that, though, they seem to degrade pretty quickly.  The cynic in me would suggest that this is by design, but perhaps I just have mean whiskers.</li>
    <li> When I first tried ProGlide, I thought it provided an excellent shave. I was very impressed with it. However, two or three shaves later, the blades were no longer cutting well. It seems my facial hair was too much for ProGlide to handle. For all of the research and development that Gillette must have put into this product to justify its price (or maybe it was just hype and advertising that inflated the price), it looks like they got it wrong. I&#x27;m having better luck with Schick Hydro 5, although Hydro 5&#x27;s shave is very different from ProGlide&#x27;s. Hydro 5 blades tend to last longer for me even if they don&#x27;t deliver the smoothness of the first shave with a fresh ProGlide blade.</li>
    <li> I just started purchasing things that i would normally buy at the supermarket on here because it&#x27;s helpful to not have to go to the store during a busy week. With Amazon Prime I get everything so much easier.</li>
    <li> The blades ordered online seem just as excellent as those I purchased at Costco previously.</li>
    <li> I have compared Schick shaving system with the Gillette Fusion system and the Fusion is far better in ease and closeness of the shave. People have complained in reviews that Fusion blade cost too much. Yes, they are relatively expensive but I get 8-10 shaves off each cartridge. Schick system is pretty good but Fusion far outperforms them. Buy the Gillette Fusion System and blades--you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> better than the generic copies.</li>
    <li> Incredibly smooth shave!  Blow dry your razor after shaving, and the life span will be extended.</li>
    <li> Nice blades. Bare in mind that this might not be nice for everyone because our shaving needs might differ. Overall this is a high quality product.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed with female razors, I tried this one. I&#x27;m glad I did. Finally I have a razor that doesn&#x27;t cut me and does the job. I wish manufacturers made good products like this razor for women. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> YMMV, but I believe that I got a counterfeit package -- the black (vs. blue) color was wrong and I have never gotten so many nicks or cuts despite years of using nothing but Fusion blades. My co-worker had a similar experience so caveat emptor.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on time as promised. The blades work as expected.  The experience with the purchase is outstanding.</li>
    <li> We decided to go with the the Proglide Regular this time, instead of the Power Glide which he has always purchased in the past and these work perfectly/</li>
    <li> these are really great razors and even though they are a bit expensive to replace often, you cannot get a better nick free shave with any other razors currently being sold!</li>
    <li> I bought these razor refills having used the normal Gillette Fusion. I think that the Proglides are a few steps better! You can tell a noticible difference, experience less nicks and a better shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price from amazon with their Subscribe and Save really did save me a bunch compared to Walmart or Target. I would reccomend these razors to anyone looking for a smooth shave</li>
    <li> Work so well. I used to be one of those people that thought once you pass two blades, it&#x27;s just overkill to add any more. I was wrong. These blades (and the rotating head) work great! The best razor I have ever used. I did try one of those mail order blade companies that sell a similar multi-blade model but it just didn&#x27;t come close to the effectiveness of these Gillette blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the blades are RIDICULOUSLY expensive. I use them until they just don&#x27;t work well. I guess the last two shaves aren&#x27;t the best but even then, it&#x27;s better than the two blade models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for sales. They do come up.</li>
    <li> Good razor but too overpriced, i joined dollar shave club for 6 bucks a month and razors are just as good if not better.  And no i have nothing to do with that company just sick of paying ridiculous amounts of money for razors!</li>
    <li> Yes, I can understand how paying up to $3 per blade is unreasonable for a lot of people.  I can sympathize.  When you go as far as to skip shaving because it&#x27;s too expensive, you know there&#x27;s a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve found that the Fusion blades are, like the Mach 3 before them, worth the extra cost.  I have very thick, fast-growing facial hair, which earned me more than my share of scrutiny when I was in the military.  Therefore, I need razors that can cut through it without excessive strokes that each take a bit of skin with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mach 3 was a huge improvement over dual-blade razors for me, and for quite a while I stuck with those rather than paying a premium for the Fusion 5-blades.  Also affecting my decision was the old Onion article: \\&quot;**** Everything, We&#x27;re Doing Five Blades,\\&quot; which reinforced my perception that a five-bladed razor was nothing but a marketing gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And perhaps it is - but it shaves noticeably better than the Mach 3, either because of the additional blades or some other less-obvious improvements.  Not only do I get a better shave with fewer strokes, but I can even skip a couple days and then cut through the beginnings of a hoary beard with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even better, the new razors seem to last longer than the Mach 3s, giving half a dozen shaves or more before they need replacement.  The Mach 3s gave up the ghost after just 3 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly recommend these razors if the cost is not a huge obstacle, especially if you&#x27;ve got facial hair from hell like I do.</li>
    <li> I do not like walking around campus looking like a grizzly bear and Gillette always makes me feel smooth after every shave.</li>
    <li> Thanks a lot for the product, they work great.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best razors I have EVER used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more when I need them.</li>
    <li> Razors for women, while looking all pretty and feminine, are not very effective for getting the REAL job done, which is getting a close shave that is well...CLOSE to as bare as you can get, which is the whole idea of shaving in the first place.  This razor (the manual one is sooo much better than than Power Fusion) is the best razor I have ever used!  The Fusion Proglide gets the job done right the first time, without all the frills, and pretty colors, which is exactly what we as women should REALLY expect out of hair removal right?  The only major con is that the refills are really pricey.  I do buy a bunch of them at a time from either Costco or E-Bay maybe once a year when I can.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much facial hair ever, but I&#x27;ll admit I tend to have a sensative face. After letting hair grow a day or two, it hurt to shave usually. But with these razors, I was highly surprised I could tell a difference. The thinner blade technology is very noticeable to be. I never get that \\&quot;tug and pull\\&quot; feeling. My only complaint is the lotioning strip thing. It tends to wear out before the blades do making it slightly uncomfortable to shave with. However these are still the best razors I&#x27;ve used to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and having the \\&quot;power\\&quot; one that vibrates also gives me a better shave. I thought it was dumb to have a vibrating razor...until I tried it. Baby face with these :)</li>
    <li> Still pefer the simpler ones when it comes to razors. Good set!</li>
    <li> At first, I thought 5-blade systems/cartridges was a comical idea. However, after using Fusion ProGlide I understand the improvement in the shaving experience. These blade systems are fantastic whether I shave everyday, or wait a few days and have a higher degree of stubble. They make for a very smooth shave for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was really hopeful when I bought these razor blades. I&#x27;ve used the fusion power for about three years and I&#x27;ve been very happy, the blades stay sharp for a long time, they shave very close and don&#x27;t leave terrible bumps anywhere you shave. I thought maybe the ProGlide blades would be even better, but they weren&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve never had a worse shave, the blades were dull as soon as they touched any hair. I would take a two blade disposable blade over the Fusion ProGlide. Don&#x27;e ever get these blades as replacements, you&#x27;re better off with the Fusion Power blades.</li>
    <li> I remember when fusion first came out and a friend sung its praise. Back then I was using Hydro and was satisfied and not willing to change. Then proglide comes out and that same friend described how proglide crushed the fusion in terms of the best shaving experience he ever had. By then I had already made my mind up to give proglide a try based on a thinner blade. As you will see here the overwhelming majority of people including me find this the best shave ever. What I find is I feel like its not shaving it is so easy to use and the results are a smooth shave no bumps or irration. Yes, very expensive and when I tried to go back to hydro I longed for proglide so here I am very satisfied albeit the price is high but my hopes are the price will drop a bit. I wish hydro would come up with a thinner blade because it really does matter. Everyones shaving experience is different but I am able to use the blade a minimum of 5 times before the blade degrades. I did find it challenging to shave moustache area but with time it has gotten better. I do shave my head as well with great ease too. Proglide really changed the shaving game. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I thoroughly liked this razor. The razor did not cause any normal &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; on my face. The way the handle connects to the actual razor is smooth, and makes shaving enjoyable. The blades lasted longer than i would typically expect from a razor.</li>
    <li> these are the best blades out there, a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Cheap and high quality!  Why pay Adrian Broady when you can pay yourself.  Check it out, help boost the economy by supporting small business.&lt;br /&gt;dollarshaveclub[dot]com</li>
    <li> Feels smoother and seems to last longer than regular fusion</li>
    <li> Bit expensive blades, Probably better blades than fusion. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t know it needs fusion proglide razor too.  So hasn&#x27;t tried yet.</li>
    <li> they  are not made by  Gillette and you can get a better shave from a butter knife</li>
    <li> Pricey but effective.  About 3 to 4 weeks per blade.  Nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to order and not hassle with the drug store and getting razor bladed.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice shave, but beard grew back in the next day.</li>
    <li> Always love these, even better with the subscription that makes them affordable!</li>
    <li> Great deal! Best razors for the price hands down.</li>
    <li> Soooo much better then disposable razors. One blade lasts for about 10 shaves.</li>
    <li> These razor blades work just as described.  They do have SLIGHTLY less tugging at hair than the non ProGlide Fusion cartridges and significantly less than the Mach 3&#x27;s.  1 razor blade lasts a little less than what i&#x27;m used to but still w/i an acceptable time.</li>
    <li> It bothers me not to give a better rating but the blades just don&#x27;t seem to shave as close. My wife and I both noticed what seems to be a difference in the closeness.&lt;br /&gt;I did not try to contact the seller so I&#x27;m not sure if they would have done anything or not.  I&#x27;ll probably just a few dollars more and buy them at the store next time.&lt;br /&gt;I love the razor/trimmer combo.  Awesome, and it works great too.</li>
    <li> The Fusion Proglide is a wonderful product! It leaves a soft, smooth shave with minimal irritation. I would suggest this product to anyone with skin that is sensitive to most shaving razors.</li>
    <li> My husband seems to like them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey but better than cutting his face!</li>
    <li> Yes, I am a woman, and yes, I use men&#x27;s razors. They work better, last longer, etc etc. However these blades are nothing like the Gillette blades I love. The lubricant strip that usually leaves my legs feeling silky smooth is nonexistent on these blades, and instead of a smooth close shave I have a rough \\&quot;morning after\\&quot; feel. Sadly I wasted about $25 because I trusted Amazon (this was sold through Amazon itself not a third party).&lt;br /&gt;The look of the packaging is very similar to regular Gillette packaging, and the look of the blades themselves are close, but the lubricant strip (while colored and appearing normal) does not work as it does on Gillette blades, and the blades themselves do not give a good close shave as Gillette blades do.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a bad batch, but according to some of the other reviews it seems as if this is an ongoing issue, so maybe they are right and this is a counterfeit item. Either way, that&#x27;s the last time I buy razor heads through Amazon.</li>
    <li> The thin blades means hair doesn&#x27;t get clogged up like the others; the only time I have to replace them is when they&#x27;re dull, not because too much beard gets lodged in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8 pack costs around $5 more than a 4 pack from my local Target.</li>
    <li> The blades dull too quickly for the price. Great shave when brand new but three or four in and it starts to irritate and cut.</li>
    <li> gillette fusion supper razor. i ame 83 years old and bought a lot of razors in my life. in cloding electric.went back to try gillette fusion .best shave ever.save big dollar. do not have to shave every day. like dispenser. thanks to amazom.</li>
    <li> I have very dense and hard facial hair, which wreaks havoc upon razors.  Not only that, but it&#x27;s curly, and a double blade razor simply doesn&#x27;t shave me well.  I had tried the MachIII razor before and felt that it was gimmicky, as it didn&#x27;t seem to shave any better than a double blade razor, but cost a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, I got a free sample Gillette Fusion razor in the mail and I gave it a try.  Wow!  This thing actually shaved me well, didn&#x27;t but me up and even had a nice trimming blade on back.  I thought that a four blade razor would be too wide/long to shave well, but I was wrong.  The best part about the Fusion is that the blades last a LONG time.  I mean it&#x27;s nothing for me to get two or three months out of a single blade.  Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that they are expensive, but considering how well they shave and how long they last, I still come out ahead.  This 8 count pack was the best price/quantity deal for me when I bought them, but as we know, prices on here change all of the time, so do your homework.</li>
    <li> I really like recommended&lt;br /&gt; Good price with good quality</li>
    <li> Careful in those nether regions they get a close shave.....</li>
    <li> I love these razors, I don&#x27;t feel women&#x27;s razors work well, therefore I buy mens. These do not cut me and they work.</li>
    <li> The shave your face clean and smooth just waaaayyy too expensive just like all other razors out there.</li>
    <li> I really believe that the 5 blades help make shaving more comfortable. I don&#x27;t really use a razor often but when I do I always use these! They&#x27;re incredibly comfortable and have a great precision tip for facial hair and sideburns. I&#x27;ve never gotten a cut while using these blades. I would highly recommend them to teenagers or anyone else who may be scared of getting cut.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Very good price. Love it. The best shaver.</li>
    <li> Please do yourselves all a favor. Do away with these multi blade razors and learn how to correctly shave with a de or straight razor. Shaving becomes a truly more gratifying experience and at the same time MUCH less costly.</li>
    <li> Great shaves everytime.</li>
    <li> Just like you buy in the store but for less $!</li>
    <li> Thought this \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; was yet more marketing hype from Gillette to get us to spend even more money for their blades. I was wrong. These are without a doubt the best blades I have EVER tried. Fantastic, close and very comfortable shave. No nicks. I have a very tough beard and the results are astounding. Definitely worth a try. I use the manual version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I use these with Art of Shaving brand Unscented Shaving Cream applied with a Badger-hair brush, their Pre-Shave Oil and their Post-Shave Balm. I was always skeptical of high-priced shaving lotions and potions. But, I&#x27;ve got to tell you these AOS products really work! After following their instructions, I&#x27;ve never got such a close or comfortable shave. Get a sample and try it for yourself. I bet you your Edge gel or whatever shave cream you use now goes right in the garbage can. Don&#x27;t get freaked out when you see the price. Actually, the AOS stuff really isn&#x27;t that much more expensive (on a per shave basis) that the products you are using now. You use very little of it for each shave. Your face will thank you.</li>
    <li> I have tried several razors and a few different electric shavers looking for a reasonably close shave without too many cuts or raw skin. Fusion ProGlide is not the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about the ProGlide is that it never cuts the skin. I&#x27;ve used them almost every day for almost 2 months without a cut. I don&#x27;t think I can say that about any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that I can never get a close shave with these blades. No matter how many times I try or how many different directions I shave the same area, it still feels a little stubbly. By the end of the day, I feel like I need a shave again. Should we have to shave twice a day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll go back to Sensor Excel and deal with some cuts in order to get a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Great idea! Great product, also love auto delivery!</li>
    <li> The best razor and blades out there!</li>
    <li> I had purchased a Gillette razor kit at my local store that included a razor, 1 extra cartridge, shaving cream, aftershave, and body wash.  After I wore down the extra cartridge it was time to order some new ones.  One researching online I decided to try the newer Proglide product.  I ordered an 8-count package and LOVE THEM.  They offer a very easy, close, and smooth shave.  I no longer use shaving cream, I just shave in the shower or let the wife do it.  I am currently on my 4th cartridge I believe, and I bought these last year.  They fit onto my existing razor base with no issues and last a long time.  I do like to put the razor at rest in a way that allows leftover moisture to drip out to help prolong the time before rust and dulling starts.</li>
    <li> Woeth for this prize and product is very good.</li>
    <li> This product is not the same as the original, you can tell when you shave and by the color which is not as the original brand.... no wonder the price is very cheap, however, it does the job but not as smooth as the original blade. I will buy the original from now own. I believe this is the cheap imitation made in China.</li>
    <li> This work&#x60;s awesome thanks !</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m doing a hybrid shave. I love to get out a shaving brush and use a good lathering cream like [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]], lather up and shave with my Proglide. I used to use a single blade, old-fashioned type razor. I read that it may prevent ingrown hairs and was easy on the skin. I found after 6 months of use that wasn&#x27;t the case for me. I picked up a proglide and wow, what a difference on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My set-up: I use a tongue depressor (Popsicle-stick if you like) and extract a small, almond-size scoop of cream from the bowl and place it in a water-warmed mug. I then take my warmed and wet badger bristle brush and begin to agitate the cream into a lather. Sometimes I have to add a bit of water to help achieve a good wet, thick lather. After Applying this warm lather to my moistened face I start hacking away (kidding). I used a single blade razor for about 6 months, but after trying a wet shave with the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor, I found the multiblade razor actually felt better for me. I know that is the opposite for some, but for me it is what works best. I actually enjoy shaving and find it a zen-time for me to relax and listen to some good music or a podcast as I shave.</li>
    <li> love it love it,,,smooth shave,,long lasting if treated properly</li>
    <li> Great...just expensive.</li>
    <li> My husband stated \\&quot;this blade is like shaving with butter\\&quot;.  Now I wasnt sure exactly if that was a good thing or bad so I asked.  He loves the proglide and doesnt ever want to go back to his regular fusion blades.  Just so everyone is aware all fusion marked blades are compatible with all fusion razors.  He thought he had to buy an all new set up to get a different blade.  But that was not the case as per the gillette website.</li>
    <li> These blades provide a shave that is both close and pretty comfortable... for the first few uses. After that, though, they seem to degrade pretty quickly. The cynic in me would suggest that this is by design, but perhaps I just have mean whiskers.</li>
    <li> I love my Gillette Fusion Pro Glide razor, because it is so versatile, but I hate that although I only shave every other day (I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair), the blades last less than a month. I have to be changing the blades more frequently than those people who shave daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades should be made to deteriorate with use, not with time.</li>
    <li> Costly blades, but you can beat this cost.  After each save, rinse the blade, towel dry it.  Then take a hair dryer (blower) and dry it again.  I picked this tip on the internet and it works.  Rust is the killer of blades and drying it this way prevents rust. One blade performed as new after many, many shaves...and still going.</li>
    <li> This is more blunt than the one we get with the razor when we buy.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first gillette razor blade with which i got irritation on my skin</li>
    <li> These cartridges are as good as the ones that come with the razor package. Its cheaper to buy on Amazon than at the store and I love them!</li>
    <li> It is what it is...slighly better blades than my Harry&#x27;s but Harry&#x27;s is more elegant</li>
    <li> I bought a set of these to go with my older Fusion razor, as it did not make any sense to me to replace it.  While I did not have issue with the regular Fusion razor blades, I was willing to to pay the increase to see if the Proguide treatment and design revisions improved things.  Alas, they do.  I was hoping they did not, so I could stock up on older original Fusion blades as they went on clearance. But I like the new Proguide blades and do think they perform better, so I guess no clearance deals for me.  At least I can save some money buying them from Amazon- so I have that working for me.  Best working razors yet, but kind of pricey.</li>
    <li> A terrific price. Much better then even Walmart&#x27;s price</li>
    <li> Although its for men we all use it in my family. Its a wonderful product. It&#x27;s very smooth and leave no hair or bumps.Totally amazing. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I travel quite a bit and keep the old Gilette Sensor Excel in my travel case, as well as the Fusion system at home. My beard is thick, black hair; a true test for any of these razor systems. Fusion has worked the best for me so far after having tried quite a few different blades. I was happy with it but when I went to go pick up blades last time, I thought I would give this one a try. While this is a good blade and a very smooth system, I don&#x27;t really notice much (if any) of an improvement over the Fusion system. The blades are even more expensive than Fusion so I&#x27;m going to have to to pass. Because shaving is such a personal thing, I\\&quot;m sure everyone will have their own opinion on these blades but for me, this was more cost with no additional value over the Fusion.</li>
    <li> Great high qulaity razor blades. I have been using them for a couple of years now and they provide me with a clean shave every day.</li>
    <li> These blades must be counterfeit or the quality has really gone down.  The blades don&#x27;t seem as sharp and don&#x27;t give a good shave, and don&#x27;t last nearly as long--the dullness irritates my skin on my neck.  I think that I will be switching brands from Gillette Fusion after many years as a customer.</li>
    <li> I love Gillette products.</li>
    <li> This was an amazing price for this product as it costs much more than this for 8 blades even at the fabulous Wally World. My Fiance&#x27; was very happy to get these because he has very sensitive skin even though he is not fair.  He says that everything else literally eats him alive, and I&#x27;ve seen the results of using other razors so I tend to agree!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m a sceptic. I was mailed one of these razors to try. So I gave it a shot. After a couple of weeks I was hooked! No nicks, and a smooth comfortable shave. Five blades! Rediculous! I wish the replacement cartridges weren&#x27;t so expensive, but what the hey, you only live once.</li>
    <li> I use this for every other day shave and a single blade has gone for month now. That is definitely longer than the earlier products (2-3 blade variants) and I am happy with it. The back blade, a kind of trimmer is also a plus, I always had difficulty reaching the stache with the Gillette 3-blade variant (the name eludes me!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is pricey, I would think about 30$ spread over 8 months isn&#x27;t such a bad deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for reference I am using it with Aveeno/ Nivea gels and it works best with both.</li>
    <li> Great blades at a comparably reasonable price. Comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Switched to the hipster safety razors for awhile but I was back to these in about 2 months.  You can&#x27;t beat them. They are a little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> :) I have used Gillette for many years and would not use anything else. Occasionally on a quick night out or trip, I had grabbed a cheap disposable, only to wish that I had packed my Proglide later!</li>
    <li> Fit my flexball razor perfect.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the feeling of my face after using the Gillette Fusion. I ordered it as a subscription and so far it has lived up to its expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over fifty-five years, and I&#x27;ve tried almost every new blade that has come out in that time. I&#x27;ve followed Gillette since their days of the double-edged straight blade through their rolled, coiled blade into their multiple-blade era. If one blade is good, two are better; if two are good, three are better. Now we&#x27;ve got the Gillette ProGlide with five blades, meant to fasten to their swivel-headed razor. The result is the best, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and the shave less likely to leave nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;however&amp;#34; is the cost. These things are the most-expensive blades Gillette (or probably anyone else) has ever made. Even Amazon&#x27;s price is about $3.75 a blade. Now, I&#x27;ve heard from people who say they can use one of these blades for up to two or three months or more, but I&#x27;ve never been able to get more than a week&#x27;s worth of use from any one of them. Maybe the people who get them to last longer have really fine beards; me, I have whiskers like a steel brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dream of being a multimillionaire is being to shave with a fresh blade every morning. But I&#x27;m not a multimillionaire, so I make do. And making do with Gillette&#x27;s ProGlide razors and blades is still plenty good. (I especially like the little straight blade they fasten to the back of the regular five-blade arrangement. You can use this single blade to get into the tight spots that the five-blade arrangement can&#x27;t get to or can&#x27;t manage well. It&#x27;s very convenient.)</li>
    <li> my son like this razor, but the replacement blades are very pricey</li>
    <li> Too hard to clean!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great shave..great on tender and thin-skinned people! The razors cut especially well for men who may need the cut without the bleeding that some razors will do! A great shave for men who use blood thinning medication!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I purchased razors off the internet. I thought it would be the same as the store but these are slighlty different and to me do not feel as sharp or shave as close</li>
    <li> In a lifetime of beard control, I&#x27;m now enjoying the smoothest shaves ever.&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Cartridge blades are state of the art and I no longer&lt;br /&gt;suffer scrapes, cuts or blood loss which once were the curse of close shaves. What&#x27;s more,&lt;br /&gt;thanks to Amazon&#x27;s automatic resupply, I always have new blades readily at hand.</li>
    <li> I use the Gillete Fusion Proglide Power razor. The razors for the power version differ from the manual one in minor ways. They both fit into each other.&lt;br /&gt;The power one is a bit costlier so I got this one to save some pennies. Amazon sells it cheaper than any of the stores ! I would say if you wanna grab one of these, this is the place to do so.</li>
    <li> Love it and it works great..</li>
    <li> Great close shave. Only issue is that the blade only lasts about 10 shaves before it gets dull. For the price of these blade I would hope it could at least get me through half a month. May be time to bring the old DE razor out again.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades, good shave.</li>
    <li> Gillette makes the very best shaving products which are not inexpensive.  Amazon provides the best prices; making it possible for the common man to get a top-of-the-line shave.</li>
    <li> One of the best razor blades on the market.  I never get any cuts when I use these blades.</li>
    <li> Better alternative than the competition</li>
    <li> Great price and value.</li>
    <li> I shave a bald head and no less than the amount of blades would do and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since they came out.  I can&#x27;t use anything else now.  These are just so comfortable to my face.  Anything else feels like I just took sand paper to my face.</li>
    <li> These are great quality razors. Close shave and they last a good length. Saved a few bucks from ordering online rather than retail store. Will probably order more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love the fusion proglides.  The razors do a great job shaving, and they seem to last longer than the older models.  My only negative is the price, which is why I wait for amazon to have coupons (make sure you look for &amp;#34;clip this coupon&amp;#34;) before I make a purchase.</li>
    <li> I hate spending so much on blades and have tried all kinds to see if there is a better option.  These work the best though.  Period.  No question.  So, if you have to spend a bit more so be it.  Better than having ingrown hairs from cheap blades.  I have found that shaving for me, and I have a medium heavy beard, the best way to shave is to wash my face with a good cleanser, use some shave secret pre shave oil, a little good cream, a face brush, and then these blades.  Best shave.  They need to figure out how to get them to last longer though.  I get 5 to 7 shaves before time to switch to a new blade.</li>
    <li> These razors are the only one I used because of the irritation I get from the others.</li>
    <li> Great razors, helps with sensitive skin</li>
    <li> bought at the promotion price and happy</li>
    <li> My order arrive in Time , that was promise ,great product , great price</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product.  Some of the best blades that I have ever used.  The only reason why I rated four stars and not five is the price.  I purchased with a $20 gift cert which brought the price down to $8.  Cartridges in general are way overpriced these days.</li>
    <li> In theory these blades are great, but each one only lasts around a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaper and better to invest in an electric shaver. I made the switch and I&#x27;m never going back.</li>
    <li> works as expected less than buying them from a local store.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Quick delivery, reasonable price.</li>
    <li> bought them for around $15. great product for a close shave</li>
    <li> These really are the best.  I usually shave 5 to 6 days a week and I can make one last me a month if I dry it well after each use but I don&#x27;t have the stingiest of beards.  It is certainly way better than any other disposable razor I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> better than buying in store</li>
    <li> they work like they should! I would recommend this to anyone! check them out now I am just looking for words.</li>
    <li> The seller was great and the razors that were sold were accuratee so no problems there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is with Gillette, in with the product itself. While yes the product does cause less tug and pull, the razor does not give you the same close long lasting shave as the previous generation Mach 5 turbo. This causes you to shave more often and go through blades faster, therefore spending more money.  I have a decent supply now, but I will return to the Turbo&#x27;s when theses are used up.</li>
    <li> ... and I still do.  But I hate it way less with these bad boys.  I switched from 4 blades to the Fusion and its made a huge difference.  Rarely have cuts anymore, less iritation and razorburn and way more comfortable.</li>
    <li> Pricey, but it gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Best blades according to my hubby, all the others are sub par compared to these.</li>
    <li> this is working just right for me</li>
    <li> Got dull within 4 shaves.  Then it began to nick me. Y experience with the older blades is the stayed sharper longer and thus didn&#x27;t cost &amp;#62;$1 per shave. Ouch!</li>
    <li> how could Gillette razors be bad? They can&#x27;t! This is a cheap way of getting your razors if u live in major city where the prices get out of control for this type of thing</li>
    <li> ProGlide razors are great because of their blade on the back for close shaves like under the shin and have 8 of them is great value.</li>
    <li> After 2 usage the blue strip is gone and after 3 time of usage  the blades are not sharp , it is a second time that I got across product like that and other I purchased before last at last 7 time of usage before the strip washed off</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53yrs new. These razor blades cartridges stay sharp for up to, some even longer,a month each. I shave in half the time it takes with most razors I&#x27;ve tried over the years. Pricey but worth it .</li>
    <li> I know these are for a guy&#x27;s razor but I got one in the mail as a sample for some reason and when I tried it out I decided right then I&#x27;d never use another kind. My legs have never be so smooth!!!  So I had to order refills and this was hands down the best deal.</li>
    <li> Have fallen in love with these blades</li>
    <li> These, to me, are about the best razor blades you can get. I think five blades is about the perfect number, creating a smooth shave and also making it less likely you will cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an even smoother shave, I recommend getting some shaving oil, instead of the traditional foam or gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Gillette product gives me a really smooth shave, no razor burns or cuts, and lasts quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s a product for my face, so I try not to skimp in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy.</li>
    <li> This is the worth the money! And I don&#x27;t have to travel out my house to go get it. On time delivery!</li>
    <li> Husband loves these blades. Easy to order and good prices at Amazon !</li>
    <li> Works nicely! Bit more flexible. Like all Gillette blades though....or maybe it is my skin.....seems to be only good for 4 shaves at most before it starts to get rough.</li>
    <li> Good product, much better than shave club, good delivery service</li>
    <li> These seem to last WAY longer than the Fusion Power blades I was using. As in 6 or 7 shaves instead of 2 or 3.</li>
    <li> Best shave with a blade!</li>
    <li> exactly what my husband ordered</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected, great condition, packaging was more than adequate and served its purpose. Will definitely continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> These are not the real Gillette Fusion Proglide. They are a knock off version. They will cut you and be worthless after 3 shaves.</li>
    <li> Excellent experience. thx</li>
    <li> The first time I tried the Proglide blade was with one of the promo packages of Fusion razors that included one Proglide in there with 4 Fusion blades.  I was surprised to find the ProGlide blade lasted almost 3x as long as the original Fusion blades in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since upgraded my handle to the Fusion Proglide with the rotating ball.  I don&#x27;t think the ball handle makes much of a difference.  It&#x27;s more that the Proglide blades just seem to be more durable and since Gillette products are so expensive getting 2x-3x the time out of one of the blades really makes it more than worth the extra few bucks for a pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can slap these blades right on the original Fusion handles and enjoy the upgraded durability without having to get the new handle.  I definitely recommend to all Fusion users to upgrade to the Proglide blades and save money from the increased durability.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only razor my husband will use and these were on sale for an amazing price.</li>
    <li> Seriously, all these blades just shred my skin, and now the swivel crap? Are they trying to kill me? One blade is all we need. This stuff is pure crap.</li>
    <li> Some have lasted 15-20 shaves, while others barely get to 5 or 6.  Seems to be lots of variability in the quality of the blades.</li>
    <li> I like this Gillette  Fusion Proglide Manual Razor because it has the add trimmer which, help when you shave under your nose.  Most of all I like how many shave you can get out of one razor;</li>
    <li> This brand create always the best shaving blade ever.&lt;br /&gt;i find a good price here . thank you soo much!!! Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> This product is supplemental to the Gilette Proglide razor.  Each of the razor blade refills has 5 separate blades which vibrate ever so slightly in the battery assisted razor and leave a very close shave.  Unlike with traditional straight edge razors, there are no razor bumps and neck/face nicks with this product.  I love it and recommend it highly particularly for men who suffer from razor bumps and ingrown facial hair.</li>
    <li> excellent and good price.</li>
    <li> i tried fusion when they first came out, and they are really the best blades that give the best shave. i did try the older style shaving blade system, but found it not effective for me.  i shave every morning, and i use 1 blade for 6 months, and my longest use was for 9 months and still in extremely good condition. Even with my secret to extend blade life, there is no disposable that can match these blades.  But the fusion blades are tremendous.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than buying individually.</li>
    <li> Great product, received on time</li>
    <li> These are by far the best razor blades on the market. They give you such a fantastic shave every time. I know they are a bit steep in price, but believe me they are worth it.</li>
    <li> I want to give it a good 1-2 months of use before I wrote a review about them. In short, are these new Fusion Proglide blades better than the previous Fusion Power/Manual blades? YES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advertised thinner blades do make a difference: these is less drag and effort applied when I shave with my Fusion Power blade handle (you don&#x27;t need to buy the new Fusion Proglide Power shaver to use these new blades). I find the shave to be much more comfortable and enjoyable with these new Proglide blades than with the Fusion Power ones I&#x27;ve been using for the past 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there a significant difference between the Proglide Manual and Power cartridges? Not that I can tell and not enough for me to fork over the extra money for them. The battery-powered handle makes the difference in the shave in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned that blade maintenance makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE in the longevity of your blades, and that is true. Always clean your blades with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing... Read more</li>
    <li> Been using these for awhile and they are just great. Nice close shave and get plenty of shaves with each blade.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT IT FOR MY SON AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT, HE LIKES THE BRAND AND HAS USED THIS FOR A FEW YEARS.</li>
    <li> Win - Win Situation using my Monthly subscribe and save feature at Amazon.  Cheaper than I can buy them at my local store,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than Walmart with my monthly subscribe and save usage.</li>
    <li> Amazingly smooth shave.  Just wish the they lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Perhaps the best razor blade in the market. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as its predecessor. The moisturizing green strip goes away before I&#x27;m prepared to throw away the blade.</li>
    <li> An excellent razor but simply not worth it.  Try Dollar Shave Club Razors (the 4X or Executive) which are at least comparable but in my honest opinion actually better ! Plus, you get them mailed to your door and shipping is free !</li>
    <li> I am committed to Fusion and appreciate this addition to my inventory. I purchased Fusion products, before the Vine provision and will purchase them again, including the after shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a closer, smoother shave than Fusion provides, please let me know.</li>
    <li> Good product. Prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been a repeat customer and faithful to this Gillette through Amazon as it saves me the hassle of going to Walmart and wait for the lady that has the key for the &amp;#34;locked up high dollar shaving blades&amp;#34;, only to find out they have one available and she needed to run to the back to get more!!! Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Con: the only problem I have is nicking myself no matter how careful I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: it shaves closer than with an electric razor</li>
    <li> Good razors, each blade lasts me around a month shaving every day (medium thickness beard).  I do dry the blade on a towel after each use because I have heard it makes it last longer.  While these blades are more expensive than cheap bargain brands, they tend to last longer and give a better shave (at least in my experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the fusion proglide gives me a better shave than some other razors, and is less irritating on my skin.</li>
    <li> I use Gillette Fusion razors for men because none of their women&#x27;s razors have satisfied me the way men&#x27;s razor has. Clean shave, just the right weight, no nicks. Awful color but works great. Refills can be pricey, but I just consider it part of my grooming and looking and feeling decent. Thankfully this time they were offering a coupon on the Amazon coupon page, so it was a great buy.</li>
    <li> These are the only razors I use.  They last a long time without getting dull.  I think they actually save me money because I hardly ever have to change the blade.  They&#x27;ve never given me razor burn and they never tug on hair, it&#x27;s always a clean cut.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide manual razor blades are good for a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> My son has a heavy beard and these are the only blades that he will use.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the ones from a brick and mortar store and a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> Good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> These blades have given me the closest shave of most that I have tried.  Works well with my powered handle and allows for a smooth shave against the grain without irritation.</li>
    <li> I always compare new blades to the old standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off - the Proglide blades WILL fit on the old Fusion handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as one other reviewer pointed out, the new Fusion Proglide handle is better balanced. I feel more comfortable with it when I&#x27;m shaving in the shower. It was worth the extra cost to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the original Fusion came out I compared to the Mach3, but couldn&#x27;t tell much difference. With a 2-day growth, I used a fresh Mach3 blade and a fresh Fusion blade, and they both pulled a little. The only big improvement I could see was the top blade for under-nose trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the Proglide is a different story. I skipped a day shaving and did the same test. The Mach3 pulled like pliers on my chin hair, but the Pro glided right through. I think the thinner blades schtick is more than a marketing line. At least for me it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but it hasn&#x27;t done anything magical like make me irresistible to the opposite sex :)</li>
    <li> Pro Tip: Do not use these to get fallen eyelashes out of your eyes. EVER. Trust me on this one.</li>
    <li> excellent product as it appears on the page and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;more attentive to Cart</li>
    <li> I bought this product and another box of blades to keep in my guest room for when I have company.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a bug fan of disposable razors and these are a much higher quality then I could ever get from a disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, all my guests, men and women, have told me they really like having a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; shaver and they appreciate the thought behind it.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my friends are happy... I am happy.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Best razor/blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> These cartridges cost quite a bit more than the standard Fusion blades, and are really lousy at shaving. Maybe it&#x27;s just my thick-haired mane, but these blades struggle to cut the keratin. I end up having to pull the blade harder, the blade gets dull faster, and my skin feels like a pawn caught between the two sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: get the regular Fusion cartridges if you need to actually shave.</li>
    <li> smooth, even and comfortable shave.  not inexpensive, but I seem to get about 2 weeks worth of daily shaving before I need to replace.</li>
    <li> I have a TOUGH and THICK beard that I started shaving 36 years ago. I have used every type and brand of razor available to me over that time but have never gotten as comfortable a shave as I regularly do with this blade.The rear of it has a blade to trim sideburns and the glide strip is absolutely the best around.It is a fast and comfortable shave. Two things I never thought I would ever say about shaving. In fact, in the past with my thick beard, shaving was always a painful and often bloody mess. &amp;#34;Zip zlock my face is ripped to shreads.....B. Cosby&amp;#34; My neck and upper lip area were always the worst. But now, truly, that is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is not a joy but it is now no longer a painful chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW DON&#x27;T stop reading there because I have issues with it too. First, the head is so large that I cannot shave between my nose and mustache (I have a goatee). It also loses the glide strip faster than my other razors. It is also not as close a shave as my Mach 3. So how I use it is that I shave the BULK of my face with this blade then switch over to the Mach 3 to finish everything. As much as I can with the Proglide because of the speed and comfort then get the spots I cannot get to with the large head with the smaller mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still very fast that way and very comfortable as a shave. I can say in fact, I have never had more comfortable shaves before this blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hoped that as I got older my beard would get thinner or softer; but only the hair on my HEAD is getting thinner and softer and more is now growing from my ears and beard than my head. Coarse and thick on my face. Thinning and softer on my head. Guess it is genetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars would require a price drop and a way to fit that comfort and speed in a slightly smaller shave head.</li>
    <li> These are the best,  gives me a nice clean shave and after the blades get a bit dull.. i use them.. elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Considering how much these are at the store, this is an awesome deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read lots of the tips people left in their reviews about how to make them last longer...and while I am unwilling to pull out the hair dryer every morning to dry this sucker off or keep in some sort of oil, I started keeping the razor flipped on its side in the cradle instead of face down, and that alone has already doubled (or more, we&#x27;ll see) the time it takes for the blades to rust...which was my main reason for tossing the cartridge before (who likes Tetanus?).</li>
    <li> For this price, you can&#x27;t beat it. Great razors for a nice low price. I am continually coming back whenever I see these things on sale, they are the only blade I use anymore!</li>
    <li> These are the best razor cartridges I have found.  They work pretty well... I like the 5 blade, providing a nice shave, and the extra blade for trimming.  Suggestion: I like Shick&#x27;s sensitive skin shave gel with these blades.... Probably just a personal preference, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the Gillette Fusion shave gel.</li>
    <li> Like all the bad reviews say, the strip on the razor heads is blue, not orange, indicating you&#x27;re getting something different than what your local drugstore has.  For me, these blades last less than half as long as the regular blades do.  I should&#x27;ve just paid full price in my local drugstore.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> I could never get the nice clean shave this blade does with a electric one. Will keep using this same one till something better is found.</li>
    <li> This a great deal especially with $8.00 off coupon I got 8 blades for 13.00. I would recommend this deal and most of amazon deals.</li>
    <li> Gives, you a nice shave.</li>
    <li> Got these for a really good deal using the clip-out coupon. I actually have several blades , but with how expensive these are I&#x27;ll surely stock up! I like these because of the multiple razors, makes a clean shave and that blue strip helps with irritation. Im sure everyone has their own brand / razor type they like to use, and this is my personal choice.</li>
    <li> If you already have the fusion proglide you&#x27;ll be looking for these. The included case is nice and convenient, though I&#x27;ve honestly never used it. The only problem is, it looks like they designed it so you can only remove the razors with with fusion proglide... otherwise they&#x27;re pretty well stuck in the case and you have to pry them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent safety feature I guess, but it might not be convenient for everyone. They have the same lifespan as other 3 bladed razors, which is a shame as they wear out pretty quickly compared to the much more durable straight razors.</li>
    <li> I had bought this type blade from Amazon before and it did not seem to be as good as I remembered. Well they aren&#x27;t. Make sure you look for the Proglide. It&#x27;s better than the regular Fusion blade.</li>
    <li> Typical razor, nothing particularly special about it - it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I love these razors. I thought the &amp;#34;Proglide&amp;#34; was a gimmick but they&#x27;re better than the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive though. I think I personally bought Roger Federer 3 new tennis balls with my order.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time...great price, too.  You have to plan a bit more to buy these mail order but it works for me.  The Fusion is a bit expensive but these blades are incredibly sharp and comfortable...and I can stretch them to about 2 weeks each.</li>
    <li> For anyone that shaves anywhere other than their face and *****EVEN your face, do NOT use this razor. I have used quality shaving cream and the pro-glide and there is no difference with the shaving cream. I am cut up so badly after I use this, that I look like a scene from a horror movie. Blood runs off of me so bad, that I was actually nervous about how much blood I was actually losing. I get severe razor burn all over my body(it has gotten better over several cut sessions) and I have cut my face several times. When saving my chin, it DOES NOT EVEN REMOVE ALL OF THE HAIR FROM MY FACE. I have torn skin under my lip, and a cut in the indent of my upper lip. PLUS, you can still see a \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; under my nose and my side burns. I bought 4 cartridges and I have bought 2 packs. After these are gone, I am 100% switching. America&#x27;s Best Razor? That&#x27;s a freaking joke.</li>
    <li> Fusion Proglide is great for the first three or four shaved then it starts to irritate...don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I looked all over for this razor after I received one free in the mail. But no one had them in the local stores. So after shaving with thing for over a year, it was getting too dull to use any more, that&#x27;s more than you could ask of any razor. So I thought has everything when I look there. Bingo I found it right away just what I wanted. The price is high but the quality is better. I love this razor</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades since their inception. They are blades that give close shaves and few if any nicks. I have all the double sided blade solutions possible including feather blades made in japan and their shave is no closer and more dangerous and take longer. I will use a brush and real lather like Jack Black or Pacific shaving cream. My blades last easily 2-3 weeks in an oil based solution and I rotate two separate razors. Never back to back with the same razor and it makes a world of difference. I&#x27;m still searching but have not found anything better as of yet. I&#x27;ll let you know when I do. Amazon will save you five bucks over retail on the 8 count. I wonder how they can list the 8 count at 28 bucks and the 16 count at 99 bucks ( yes I know its a different vendor). Still it&#x27;s a slap in the face. I am also concerned about complaints about knockoffs that keep creeping up. Never get these in anything but the original packaging period. I&#x27;ve had good luck so far with Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband bought the Gillette Fusion Proglide manual razor first, and after sneaking a use in the shower, I had to have one too. It gives the best, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve experienced of all the manual razors I&#x27;ve ever tried. For this reason I&#x27;ll continue to use it. However, I&#x27;m annoyed with the razor manufacturers&#x27; current practice of price gouging for the replacement blades. Seems like it is done with most brands (mens and womens razors). I get a bit of relief by using Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save,&amp;#34; through which I get a delivery of the blades every few months. I also look for manufacturer coupons in the Sunday paper, and use them when my bottom line price is lower.</li>
    <li> Still overpriced but they work great. You know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> No other razor has made my man&#x27;s face as soft as a baby&#x27;s rear end like this one does.  And buying them on Amazon is the cheapest and most efficient way to go!  Lord knows I can&#x27;t get him to buy them himself.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, they work, the price was what I needed, and I didn&#x27;t have to drive to the store to pick some up.</li>
    <li> Great razors at a good Price. I love these razors but have trouble getting the replacements. This is the perfect answer. Shipped promptly and received exactly as expected-</li>
    <li> These shaving blades are very costly and not worth the money. You are much better off buying a double edge razor and double edge razor blades. With a double edge razor and blades,  a shaving brush an a tin of shaving soap you can shave all year long for $50.00. These are fair blades if you are a Wall Street Banker and thief and can afford them. Try a double edge razor and you will Never go back to these rip offs. Also, they are manufactured in Mexico and the quality and disinfection of these blades are poor.</li>
    <li> Work great while they last but don&#x27;t last long. But if you use these razors this is nothing that you don&#x27;t already know. I only shave every few days but I am lucky to get 3 good shaves out of each blade. After that you can feel the change in the smoothness of the shave.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know it could be me it seems product don&#x27;t cut like it use to ,still the best on market just not as good</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re razor blades. I shave with them. They cost a lot but they last a pretty long time.</li>
    <li> Great to have.  Beats grocery and drug store prices.  Must have!</li>
    <li> Though one of the priciest razors on the market, I have learned I can make each blade last upwards of 3 weeks, shaving 6 days a week.  That&#x27;s 18 shaves in 21 days.  That allows me to purchase an 8-pack and make it last a good 6 months.  It starts to tug near the end, but still produces a good shave.  I was a member of one the internet Shaving Clubs and could not make a blade last more than one week.  It sounded cheaper, but in the long run, I actually spend less staying with Gillette.</li>
    <li> A little disappointing.  Each razors worn out after 4-5 shaves.  I was expecting more from Gillette razors.</li>
    <li> One of the best blades out there! Over the years I have tried many different companies and products and I find that these are the best shave that I get. Would highly recommend! Will definitely be buying them again and sticking with this razor type for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great blade, high cost. I&#x27;ve been using these blades and the prior incarnations from Gillette all my shaving life (45 years?!). Fortunately, they haven&#x27;t found a way to squeeze  more blades in these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get them on &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I used an electric shaver for many years thinking it gave me a closer shave than a blade.  Compared to the blades of the time that was probably true.  However, new technology now gives us the ProGlide, which I think is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
    <li> Been using for years, works great.&lt;br /&gt;Been using compressed air to clean mess out from between blades after shave. Helps a lot .</li>
    <li> This is the only that gets a close shave on my husband&#x27;s face.  He grows a thick beard very fast.</li>
    <li> The razor feels great.  Better than the original fusion.  But it doesn&#x27;t travel well.  It came loose in my luggage and half of the lubricating strip rubbed off.  The strip is delicate when wet.  Then there&#x27;s the price, it&#x27;s expensive.  Still, it feels great if you can stomach the price tag.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for a great price! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Hate the cost, but nothing else close. Read article on shaving, shave after you shower, shave down, then up. Everything I don&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> Been using them for a while now. great shave pricey but the blades last quite a while. I feel they are worth it.</li>
    <li> Been using these blades for years. Very comfortable shave. Extra blade on the back is great for getting under the nose.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite razor blades.  He wont use anything else at all.  They cut great and he uses them for not just his face but also his head!</li>
    <li> Good blades, but you need a knife to open the package to get them out, which made them harder to use.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! I have sensitive skin and the Fusion Proglide is the only razor in the world that doesn&#x27;t make my face feel like I spent the day at the beach without sunscreen! Silky smooth results!!!</li>
    <li> Is what it is... What can you say. Got a better price than the box stores, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> My son has the heaviest beard ever. His barber uses hot towels, and two kinds of blades. It takes him twice as long as his other clients. If it&#x27;s grown in a few days, the barber comments my son has been hibernating again. He uses these at home and they are the ONLY blades that get a decent, close shave.</li>
    <li> Saves me time and don&#x27;t run out. I &amp;#34;HATE&amp;#34; buying blades. This way I don&#x27;t have to look at the price, the prices kills me ,the cost smokes my a$s, this way I don&#x27;t think of it that much, they just show up. Ya weird but true.</li>
    <li> These ARE in fact better than the older Fusion Power ones. While not cheap, the Amazon pricing was good and I am happy to get them &amp;#34;sunsribed&amp;#34; now. These seem to last a little longer than the Fusion Power as well. Good close shave with little to no cuts.</li>
    <li> Well this has not cut my face and I have been using them for years now. I don&#x27;t get bumps either&amp;#62; because of this I keep buying them. The price is good, better than a known store in my area.</li>
    <li> Even though the packing can be different but it shaves the same as if you buy and pay more at the store. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion proglide razors are the only kind of razors my husband will use.  Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried buying him cheaper alternatives but none of them compare in his opinion. . .my only complaint is the cost of the cartridges!  Lucky for me I found S&amp;S on amazon and am able to buy him refills at a much better price than our local stores!</li>
    <li> First, the one I received required the Jaws of Life to open the package.  Are razor blades so valuable that they have to make it impossible to access the product once purchased?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, in the last package I bought here on Amazon, 4 of 8 were bad blades from the get-go.  They were dull, caused rash and even a bit dangerous if you ask me.  These are far too expensive for that.  When they&#x27;re good, they&#x27;re fine.  But when you end up hurting yourself and can only use 4 of 8, well, now the price has doubled.  Are these people selling seconds on Amazon????</li>
    <li> Good razors and got a great deal.</li>
    <li> Love these blades, never get cut up</li>
    <li> There is nothing really to say! They shave my face with little or no irritation.</li>
    <li> What can you really say about razors. I have been using these razors for about six years and would never change. Got give em&#x27; five stars. Really good product</li>
    <li> Great deal and quick service. These blades were exactly what I was looking for. My husband won&#x27;t use any other blades.</li>
    <li> Genuine razors at a great price. Much cheaper than buying at a brick n mortar store. Hopefully they have more coupons soon</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I&#x27;ve found and by having them shipped on a regular basis I got the best price I&#x27;ve found anywhere</li>
    <li> Spot on description, speedy delivery</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job with a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Saves a lot of time looooking for a good deal. And comes right to the door.  So happy I found it.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery. Love these and razors and they are priced well on amazon!</li>
    <li> Bad quality maybe is fake i dont know. After 3 times shaving drop at garbage</li>
    <li> The blades were OK but I think they are a knock off.  They did not provide a nice clean cut like others I&#x27;ve bought in teh store so iw onder if they were a knock off.</li>
    <li> Good blades That last forever it you remember to keep them dry when not shaving!</li>
    <li> Good seller. I received the product on time and without problems. I recommend for all.</li>
    <li> After purchasing hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars from Amazon I finally feel compelled to write my first review in an effort to help my fellow Amazonians avoid making the same mistake I did by purchasing this product. A one star rating is too generous. These look and feel like used blades that have been through 20 shaves. Not only are they lacking any color on the strip the strip is also somewhat chewed up. Maybe they are used? Sandpaper would be smoother. The only thing stupider than this product is me for not returning it after my first shave. It wasn&#x27;t worth the effort. Maybe mine is the exception to the rule. If not DO NOT PURCHASE!</li>
    <li> Great shave with these blades.  Can get about 8 shaves per cartridge.  Very happy with this purchase. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great Razor blades, they are very well made and leave your face baby smooth! Highly recommend this product! ! !</li>
    <li> Great price and convenient way of purchasing a commonly used item.</li>
    <li> Great product but they are way too expensive! It&#x27;s a known fact about the razor industry but maybe enough of us can cause a ruckus to lower the price.</li>
    <li> The feeling of sweet pleasure Aloe and metal against your face quickly dissipates after a mere 3-4 uses. In which case their is a sweet feeling of pain accompanied by a rash.</li>
    <li> Check out the video  So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So this is my opinion comparing years of using the Gillette razors vs Dollar Shave Club mid range 4x razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...] Click Here Check this out video review</li>
    <li> Seems line the lob strip wears out really quickly and turns white.  This must be Gillette&#x27;s B team blades.  Expensive.</li>
    <li> I get a good  and clean shave and like this product.&lt;br /&gt;My only question is how long can I use each blade before it will no longer works?&lt;br /&gt;So far I have used it three times and it still shaves clean.</li>
    <li> Nice price! Sure beats the local retailers! Shipping was quick also! Yes, these are geniune Gillette&#x27;s.If I am wrong, then they are close enough that it doesn&#x27;t matter. Will order again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> best razor blades out there to the extent I know, smooth shave. Con is the price as I have the same view with most all of the multi-blade setups. Best thing going if you can stomach the price...but then consider the alternatives.</li>
    <li> This product is the only one my son will use, and I&#x27;m so glad he does! His face is always so smooth and soft. His wife is very happy too! These never cause him any irritation at all and the shave is super close! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My husband hates to run out of these blades and by purchasing this package I am definitely ahead of the game.  Good price also</li>
    <li> These are the only blades I use.  They are expensive but they do last a good while and give me a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Work great.  But still overpriced, as they all are...</li>
    <li> The Gillette fusion proglide blades are really nice! You get a really nice close shave with less tug and pull.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, they are refills, what would you expect if you&#x27;ve used them before in the past? : )</li>
    <li> Great value, much cheaper than what I can get it for, at local stores even using coupons etc. Have used the product from Amazon and it works great like the ones I bought before at local stores. Some reviewers were concerned that it might be duplicate etc.. I don&#x27;t think that is the case, but could be product intended for sale in other countries ( at lower prices) as it does have both English and Spanish info. on the pack. Would definitely buy from Amazon again.  One thing I learnt from the other reviewers is that it is best to keep the razor dry when stored.  I used to leave it face down near the sink, but now I am going to leave it with blade side up and away from sink to see if it increases the life.  Wish I had checked for razors on amazon before and saved myself some money.</li>
    <li> For my &amp;#34;field test,&amp;#34; I used this product on a ProoGlide razor body. I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel. I then waited several minutes for my beard to soften. I began shaving in the easier portions of my face, where the whiskers are lighter, then proceeded to the heavier sections around my chin. Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The blades nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging. The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting. I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result. The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave. (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.) To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the &amp;#34;Enhanced Lubrastrip.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green. This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ SUMMARY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors. My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags. One possible caveat--the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products. However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♫ A Review by Chris Lawson</li>
    <li> Love these blades! They give a nice close shave and leave you feeling smooth! I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver for months now because my last manual wasn&#x27;t cutting it. Decided to give these a try and now I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll have to ditch the electric shaver for these. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these particular razors were actually premium or rejects from Gillette. The plastic shells were clear unlike the blue ones that I always got from the local store and they didn&#x27;t seem quite as sharp as what I was used to. I&#x27;ve used Gillette for years and it &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; like they intentionally make the blades worse each time they come out with a new product to try and get us to switch to the new more expensive stuff. This same phenomenon happened with the Mach 3&#x27;s back when those were top of the line. Then the Fusions when the ProGlide&#x27;s came out. They worked awesome as a new product until something newer was introduced and suddenly they seemed to go down a notch in quality. They&#x27;re also way too expensive. After many many years of feeling ripped off by Gillette, I finally decided to switch to the old school DE razor and blades and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! It&#x27;s so much cheaper and the same quality of shave. It just took me a little practice to re-learn my shaving technique. If you&#x27;re tired of feeling ripped off by the cartridge razor world, do yourself a favor and try the DE razor with good blades (they&#x27;re typically about $3 for 5 after you have your razor handle). I tried, and am still using, the Edwin Jagger Kelvin DE razor (it was some kind of Amazon deal) and am happy with it much more than the Gillette situation. Don&#x27;t forget to switch your shave cream also. You can search the interwebs about all of this stuff and get plenty of information to make a good choice.</li>
    <li> There are a few things in life worth finding a deal on.  I never feel like I found a deal on shaving blades since we have become spoiled with the quality of the fusion product line.  I love these blades but only spend the money they ask because I don&#x27;t have a choice.  You can go cheap on a lot of things but the blade that shaves your face has to be the best.</li>
    <li> This is the only blades that were good on my face.  I just wish they were little cheaper, but I would buy them again</li>
    <li> Bought them for the price</li>
    <li> i have used several razors and due to my thick facial hair i shave once a day.  Fusion never gives me any knicks or cuts where as other brands or less blade razors constantly have... I highly recommend you use it with the razor buddy to make the blade last longer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase as the product as well as the price made this a great deal for me</li>
    <li> Every now and then you get a clinker. Not so bad that I won&#x27;t use them, but noticeable. Regardless, these are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ll continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> After switching from Gillette Mach3, this blades are huge upgrade. Super sharp and stay sharp very long (shaving twice a week I can use 1 blade for 4-6 months) and regular shaving takes much shorter than with the Mach3. The only disadvantage is long beard - as the distances between knives are shorter, the blade gets jammed with hair faster than Mach3.</li>
    <li> Been using them from past 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality and durable</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and received I recieved a sample from Gillette to try it out, #GotADiscount. It&#x27;s a best seller on Amazon for a reason.  These blades are awesome!  I can get a clean close shave in one pass with these.  No need to go over the same spot 3 or 4 times with these because the 5 blades get every last hair!  I save time and have a better, closer, more comfortable shave every time with these.  Keep them dry and clean and they will last a good long time.</li>
    <li> Bought a second handle so I could use these blades without stealing my husband&#x27;s.  Much better than any women&#x27;s razor I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I recently received a Gillette Fusion Proglide handle and blade and, within 5 minutes of using it, knew it would be replacing my Gillette Mach 3.  I get a much better and smoother shave from this blade than I ever got with the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;My primary reason for buying the blades on Amazon? Easy, they&#x27;re less expensive and I get free shipping. These blade aren&#x27;t cheap so saving a few dollars by shopping here on Amazon helps.</li>
    <li> All razors seem to be terrible, but this one seems less terrible than others. I&#x27;ve stuck with it for a while now.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my boyfriend as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. With how expensive an adult stocking can be its nice to save money where you can. So I was very excited to find his favorite blades for the cheapest price anywhere even beat wally world which I loathe going into during the Christmas season. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> About the only reason I couldn&#x27;t give a 5 star review is the blades do not seem to last very long.  It could be that I am using them to shave my head rather than face, but I only get about 3 shaves before having to replace the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as comfort goes they are A+ top notch.  The best I have found so far</li>
    <li> The proglide system is a very nice shave.  I never nick my face\ and it leaves a smooth shave. Hooray!</li>
    <li> I have been continuous user of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual razor, and have found it to be the best blade I have ever used.</li>
    <li> There is only one choice I go to for shaving and its the Fusion blades, they are pricey but last well and leave your skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Everthing as promised.</li>
    <li> I used blades for almost 40 years.  I still prefer the overall closeness of blades.  HOwever, it seems to me that the refills were always of somewhat lower quality than the blades that come with the razor.  I don&#x27;t know if this is coincidence or only my personal experience.  It did seem to happen quite frequently.  And I would bleed a lot.  So I tired of bleeding and switched.  Well, electrics have improved very much since I was a kid and first shaving.  I decided I could live with a not quite so close shave because I preferred not to bleed.  Just me....</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how long the blades last, much longer than any other blade that I have ever used. The value is definitely there, given the relatively high price. But, alas, it is revolutionary.</li>
    <li> meh... went back to my old twin blade.  These blades are just too big to get into the tight places on my face, so I end up having to keep my old twin-blade around.  Ended up giving this to my Wife for her Legs..</li>
    <li> Gillette provided me a free sample of their Fusion Proglide razor with a blade.  The refills are a bit pricey but I would recommend them to anyone. They give a great close shave &amp; the  don&#x27;t get dull as quickly as most razors I&#x27;ve tried.  I have used them both on a face and head surface and they continue to impress.</li>
    <li> I would like to get a new base every couple of orders.  Use them in the shower and the base just isn&#x27;t durable. nothing like having a fresh razor when you need it.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCTS. FAST SHIPPING. WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> These are not good blades not the same sold in retail stores, where you get 60 days shaving (I do have heavy beard) by keeping them dry. These are a cheap inmidation and won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Withholding the last star for the high price. I know these are some good razors, but they&#x27;re still ultimately steel and plastic.</li>
    <li> I have never had such a smooth shave with any other product. It was so easy and I have not cut my self after many shaves.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the Amazon prices</li>
    <li> I bought this from Amazon and have loved it from the day that it arrived.  It takes up very little space in my bathroom.  I have been shaving every day for some months now, and this razor with the fusion blades, gives me a smooth shave every day for about two weeks, before it loses some of it sharpness.  I got the manual one instead of the electonic razor because I like total control over what I&#x27;m doing as I shave (and also because I say the face of a friend who cut himself when he first used his electronic version).  It&#x27;s case stores on tope of the case for the blades,so that when replacement is needed, it&#x27;s really easy.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that lasts a long time for a person like me who shaves once a week. No other razor I have used works as well as these.</li>
    <li> Very good razor. So much better than the generic replacements I found on groupon. Plus I like the auto subscription option.</li>
    <li> Great razors, cheaper than Walmart.</li>
    <li> These were about the same price as in the store, save for a couple of bucks. I hate buying razors. They&#x27;re so freaking expensive.</li>
    <li> Probably like most who have looked at these razors you are concerned if there real blades and not knock offs.  Well the ones I got are the real deal and shave great.  I go to a barber from time to time and get a shave.  He uses a new straight razor and shaves me twice.  These blades rival that shave.  Smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
    <li> nice but not sharp enough, feels like not satisfied after shave</li>
    <li> Replacement blades are very expensive.  On Average razor blades are said to have a 5,000% markup.</li>
    <li> This product came in factory packaging, which is rare for the pricing and was as represented.  I love these blades and are the only ones I shave with.  I am cursed with a wire beard and a baby soft skin.  These blades help abrasion immensely.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both have a Gillette fusion razor and do does my son. I bought these st Christmas for my son and opted for the shipment of 8 razors every 2 months. It&#x27;s been so convenient and all 3 of us have been in good supply! What a great son I have to share with his parents. Thanks! Sincerely, Mama</li>
    <li> Great product and packaging is easier to open than other wrapping for the same product in other stores.</li>
    <li> Knock-offs, but they work, so I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
    <li> I have all ready reviewed this item but Amazon rejected it.I will try again.I buy the proglide manual razor from Amazon because they have the best price if you check all their venders and get free shipping.I have a thick and tough beard and since I switched from the Gillette sensor,the Gillette fusion proglide has given the best shave and they last much longer ,at least for me,than any other blade.Shaving is a pain in the you no what, when you do it almost everyday as long as I have.These blades make the morning shave quicker and easier.A great deal through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have always used Gillette razors and I like the fusion best. Amazon is the best place I have found to buy them because of the price. They beat Wal-Mart by a lot, and that is about the cheapest place I have to buy anything. These fit in either the manual or power handles. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Goods are returned without cause, I didn&#x27;t see the goods</li>
    <li> I am generally too cheap to buy anything but the most inexpensive disposable razors, but these have made a believer out of me.</li>
    <li> I am a female and I only use these razors. They never rust and give you the closes shave possible an unlike it&#x27;s more feminine counterpart the venus this razoz does not get dull after multiple uses.</li>
    <li> I have really bad sensitive skin, so it took me a while to find a good blade that didn&#x27;t wreak havoc on my face. I use this blade regularly and it is by far my go to blade. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Gillette products on a whole, but this one definitely gets my business.</li>
    <li> Have always used these blades. Nice to get with subscribe and save. The best blades for a smooth shave. And a great price.</li>
    <li> I just place these on subscription. No more paying a premium at local drug store due to my lack of planning!</li>
    <li> My son and husband both have sensitive skin. These are the only razors that don&#x27;t pull and aggravate their skin.</li>
    <li> Great blades at a cheaper cost than CVS.</li>
    <li> Still, I have the mindset that the things that cost more are usually worth it, so I spring for them.  Besides, I don&#x27;t shave that often to worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion series itself is really nice though.  I have noticed that, combined with some good shaving products (read nothing in a can) I no longer have irritated skin or little nicks.</li>
    <li> Always good to have a refill of razor blades. Smooth shave and last a long time before replacing. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these for ANY guy who wants a clean, comfortable, close shave! And who doesn&#x27;t? Any other razors are primitive by comparison.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband because he has sensitive skin.  He is not one to express his opinion so I was surprised when he told me how much he liked this razor.  And between you and me, I borrow it when he&#x27;s not looking.</li>
    <li> The best razors made, according to my husband. Very good shaving job! My local store was out, so I ordered on-line. Came fast. Will re-order when needed.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my son for Christmas as he says this product gives a very smooth close shave...and it does!</li>
    <li> The best razor blade I have seen in my life. One cartridge lasts three weeks for me, although I shave every day , and no cuts or irritation of the skin. If Gillette does not discontinue it for being so good, I will use it for the rest of my life, Benny</li>
    <li> Aw man, it doesn&#x27;t get any better than these. I know, I know, a dopey 5-blade razor, who needs the 5 blades, right? Frills and whistles, right? Nope, there&#x27;s no better shave on the planet than these things. They mow down my bristle-brush beard ear-to-ear in about 5 minutes, never a nick. The trimmer on the top is handy for the ears and close to your snoot. My gal likes it for her legs, but the Venus shaver I suspect, is the same 5 blades. I think she also likes the Fusion Pro because it vibrates. Although the vibration feature doesn&#x27;t seem to make the shave better, she likes it anyway!</li>
    <li> I find that the product is very efficient. My shaves are much smoother with less nicks and less passes over one spot. Excellent. product</li>
    <li> I am totally satisfied with all aspects of this purchase. I received the item as promised and it does everything that it is supposed to do. The price was great and I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> i bought these at the same time as the new fusion.  they are still in the box, since the blade that came on the fusion is still holding its edge.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette Fusion for quite a while now.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a bit sceptical about trying the Fusion Proglide I thought&lt;br /&gt;it may be just an advertising gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;However I recently purchased the Gillette Fusion Proglide on Amazon and&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets; it gives a much cleaner closer and comfortable&lt;br /&gt;shave with a smooth sensation, while shaving the  blades glides easily&lt;br /&gt;across the face.&lt;br /&gt;It works  with the original Fusion blade holder too.&lt;br /&gt;It is indeed an enhancement from the previous version.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I like these blades and they arrived promptly at a good price.</li>
    <li> Quite skeptical at first.  But these blades are excellent.  I noticed they are thinner than the Mach 3, which I still use - and this might be the reason why they seem to cut better than any other blades I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that I have not cut myself once during the past month I have been using them.  Excellent product.  But my goodness, these blades are expensive!  So far, so good.  I&#x27;ve used the Trac II and the Mach 3 and at this rate - it looks like I finally found one I like.</li>
    <li> The products were good, but the shipping was very poor. It was delived in the mailbox. The out side temperature was 110 and the cologne, body spray and others were sitting in the hot sun for hours. Hopefully you will LEARN  not to do this to anyone else.</li>
    <li> Have used mens razors for years.  Because mens seem to be cheaper and last longer.</li>
    <li> Hate the price, but have not found an equivalent blade anywhere else.  Each blade lasts me about a week.</li>
    <li> My husband have been using these blade for years.  I just found out that you extend the life of the blades by using  &#x27;Blue Jean Sharpening Method&#x27; it will extend your blade life and receive a sharp and smooth shave for weeks.  Great way to save a lot money.</li>
    <li> We tried cheaper blades; however, they were extremely rough on skin. Plus, the discount via Prime subscription makes these a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> Just remember to adjust the wing nut before you use this grinder; it starts as a very fine mist you can hardly see. I like it a bit more coarse.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t seem as sharp as the ones bought at the store.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery.  Good price.</li>
    <li> I fully understand the need to continue to develop new razor blade designs to keep the prices sky high but these are too large by half and so it is difficult to shave the upper lip area without nicking the skin and drawing blood. I get fewer shaves per blade than with my prior double blade razors including disposable ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably be going back to using disposable razors to get away from these marketing driven ones.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the Fusion and the blades. He prefers to use these to shave his head than those which are designed to.</li>
    <li> THESE BLADES WILL LAST ABOUT 6-7 USES ON MEDIUM COARSE HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY GIVE YOU AN AMAZING SHAVE EVERY TIME !</li>
    <li> Very very little pull shaving...&lt;br /&gt;One blade lasts me a few to several weeks shaving daily...&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more of these...</li>
    <li> Great blades, some of the few that don&#x27;t cut up or irritate my face.  Would rate them much higher if they weren&#x27;t so expensive.  Several different versions that seem to work fine with fusion power razer, so just look and see which one is on sale.</li>
    <li> I tried the Schick razor and boy did I change in a hurry, now I don&#x27;t have to go to the store to buy. they come right to me on a subscription basis.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why the razor is not as sharp as I remember, but it works</li>
    <li> The item is exactly as expected. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This, by far, is the best razor out there. I shave my head 5 times a week, and I won&#x27;t use any other razor.</li>
    <li> Guys, do yourselves a favor and drop these for a DE razor. I just bought 100 blades for ~11 dollars on Amazon and I&#x27;m getting a closer shave than ever before. Cartridge razors just can&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.  They provide a close shave and glide smoothly over my skin.  I recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Most high end razors are manufactured to fit the Fusion Proglide blades.  They do provide an excellent, close shave.  After 4-5 uses the lubricating strip begins to fade to where it no longer provides protection and I have nicked my face on a few occasions when I&#x27;ve tried to extend the life of the blade. I also use a good brush and good shaving soap. If you&#x27;re looking for a blade which will give you 4 or 5 good shaves, this is the best out there.</li>
    <li> Just won&#x27;t switch to another brand.</li>
    <li> I am a Gillette user, and I really enjoy all their products, but the ProGlide definitely lived up to its hype. It is a much smoother shave and much easier to handle. The thing that I like about it is that I don&#x27;t have to continuously go around my facial hair several times to ensure that I &amp;#34;got it all&amp;#34;. It seems to do a much better job getting around the sharp contours of my face, which makes up for a much leaner shave. Also, I shave once a week or so, but I used ProGlide more often to see if there was a difference between the Fusion and the ProGlide, and I happened to see better results without razor burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I did not like about it is that the blade wore out so fast. I used it about four times in a week, and by the fourth time I was struggling to get nice clean shave again. I had to do the same thing I do with the Fusion and go over some parts of my face more often than others.</li>
    <li> Greatest razor available!! Have used for years.</li>
    <li> These are the only razors my husband will use and he goes through them rather quickly. He has sensitive skin and these do not irritate him. I have also noticed they give him a good clean close shave. Some of the other razors he has used in the past don&#x27;t do this. We usually just grab them at Target or Walmart but they are pricey so I have started to shop around for them.  I found them on Amazon with a $6.00 Amazon coupon attached so this was a steal deal!</li>
    <li> My husband bought the Gillette Fusion Proglide manual razor first, and after sneaking a use in the shower, I had to have one too. It gives the best, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve experienced of all the manual razors I&#x27;ve ever tried. For this reason I&#x27;ll continue to use it. However, I&#x27;m annoyed with the razor manufacturers&#x27; current practice of price gouging for the replacement blades. Seems like it is done with most brands (mens and womens razors). I get a bit of relief by using Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;Subscribe and Save,\\&quot; through which I get a delivery of the blades every few months. I also look for manufacturer coupons in the Sunday paper, and use them when my bottom line price is lower.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing to me how much razors cost these days, its unbelievable.  That said, I do like the Gillette Proglide razors and will continue to buy, although the price is higher than I would like to pay</li>
    <li> I use these for my travel razor and they work pretty well.</li>
    <li> THE PROVEN CHAMP OF RAZORS!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to throw away my old razor system after I tried. Recommended by the wire cutter and they were correct.</li>
    <li> I was just like every other woman out there always using ladies razors with all the fancy colors, lotions, gels, handles what have you. Then one day I read an article somewhere saying how men&#x27;s razors can work better for you b/c they are designed to shave coarser hairs (like those on a man&#x27;s face).  I decided to give it a try and asked my boyfriend at the time what razor he used and he gave me an extra one to use.  I have never turned back since!  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide especially works wonders on my legs, underarms, bikini area.  I get such a close and smooth shave with barely any razor burn or bumps ever.  It just kills me how expensive the actual razor blades can be so naturally I looked here on Amazon and this was a decent price for 8 blades.  I&#x27;m telling you ladies give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed and will be throwing that Venus razor out!</li>
    <li> After a few weeks with old, dull razor blades, I finally purchased some replacement blades through Amazon instead of going to my usual store because the price seemed better. When they arrived, I was so excited to finally get a nice smooth shave. To my disappointment, these blades did not feel sharp like other Fusion products I have purchased, leaving my legs still feeling scratchy. When my boyfriend tried to shave, the blade irritated his face so much he got red blotches around his lips.  I may as well have bought cheap disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Not the same blades you get in the store.. Sounds like a good deal.... but TRUST ME they are not the same as the original name brand blades.....unless the production or manufacturing has gone DOWN HILL...  They work yes, but its not the same feel and shave as the original.</li>
    <li> Good but I feel like they dull quickly.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use these and they work well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and cheaper than going to Walmart</li>
    <li> ive tried everything to help decrease irritation as least as possible i switched to these and im satisfied on how good they work.you feel less drag when cutting the hairs and i hardly get bumps since i switched. they last pretty long i usually shave every two or three days and its been almost a month and i havent changed it yet and they still work pretty good they are pretty expensive so i try to make them last but in the store theyre almost 30 somewhat dollars for eight. (i know they&#x27;re good but damn) I found them on here for 10 bucks cheaper and theyre delivered pretty fast will definitely purchase them on here for now on </li>
    <li> Great razor, much better price than you&#x27;ll find at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Definitely the real thing. LovE the 5 blades. I have sensitive skin and these blades make it easy to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD. IF YOU USE THE REGULAR PROGLIDE MACHINE THIS IS THE PERFECT MATCH.&lt;br /&gt; I WAS USING THE POWER VERSION, WRONG.</li>
    <li> They give me a really close shave and last a long time.  I change my blade once a month when I pay the mortgage.</li>
    <li> For my son ...cheaper than drug stores and supermarkets....and I will not buy 20 at a clip in CostCo for 59.95....</li>
    <li> This ia a good quality razor blade for a fair price.</li>
    <li> Great product to use!</li>
    <li> Love a cartridge razor blade? Yes, I switched back after about two years alternating between a straight razor and a safety razor.  The simple reason is that neither gives as comfortable and as quick a shave as I found Gillette Fusion, and there really is no loss of closeness when used with a quality pre-shave (mine is Edwin Jagger lotion) and shaving cream (I use Truefitt &amp; Hill).  My original reason for leaving cartridges was the cost, but I found that I could get only one close shave from a double-edged blade irrespective of the brand (and with some not even a close shave the first time) no matter how much I pampered it after shaving.  I get several shaves from the Gillette Fusion.  On a cost-per-shave basis, it is at least breakeven.  The balance, though, clearly favors Gillette Fusion when comfort is taken into consideration.  Sharp double-edged blades are thin (see my review of Feather), and that causes skin irritation, much, much more than Gillette Fusion.  Finally, there is time unless you&#x27;re into shaving as a hobby.  Shaving with a cartridge is simply the quickest.</li>
    <li> Better then women blades</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described.  I&#x27;m very happy with the performance.</li>
    <li> I have seen these razors advertised with men using them, but they are excellent for females too!!! I do not need to shave everyday as I did with other razors...their great!!!</li>
    <li> The BEST razor blades you can buy. I received an electric razor as a gift and it can&#x27;t even hold a torch to the shave I get from these blades. I just shave every other day and the blades last quite awhile as long as you dry them off after each use.</li>
    <li> These blades have been very rough on my skin. I need to order the orange colored ones that I had been using. These don&#x27;t seem like Gillette quality to me.</li>
    <li> I shave before I shower with a Norelco PT730 razor and the in the shower I finish shaving with the Gillette Fusion razor, using Pantene Hair Conditioner as a lubricant (and for the hair still on my head).  Using this method, one Fusion cartridge lasts me 6 -8 months.</li>
    <li> Listen. I&#x27;m a shave-a-holic. You will have to mortgage your house to keep a steady supply of these razors, but I&#x27;m promise that you&#x27;ll be as hairless as an embryo. Use with Fusion Gel and go easy when razor is fresh, or you&#x27;ll shave off your leg and bleed like amputee. Free advice there.</li>
    <li> I always get this with the automatic shipment and end up saving a little bit more than the usual.  Better price than the stores</li>
    <li> at first i was skeptical - how many times are they going to change the color of the plastic around the blade or add different gel strips with bubbles blah blah blah. but i got a free sample and MAN these blades ROCK. I am usually unable to shave more than once every other day due to razor burn - i keep my razors sharp but even right out of the package the regular fusion blades tear me up. Shaving has always been an ordeal - I&#x27;ve tried dozens if not hundreds of different shaving products from blades to pre-shave oils to aftershave to shaving creams to shaving brushes to etc etc. These blades are the only thing I changed and now I can shave my neck every day, and with sharpening before every use I&#x27;ve been able to use one razor for 5 times already with no issues. I&#x27;ve used these blades for about a month now and I&#x27;m never going back.</li>
    <li> this is the best deal you can ever find because instores just a 4 pack would cost you $18, the packaging was great and shipping was fast, i had no problems with these blades and they are still going. They last very long. The trimmer blade on the back is so useful for trimming side burns or your mustache.</li>
    <li> The fusion blades are very durable, I use one every 3 months or so and it still works well. Normal use after a month is better, but these are very expensive.</li>
    <li> We got this at a cheaper rate than was priced at an very known Store that is suppose to be a cheaper rate. He is very much pleased with this and he will have me to order again.Thanks. Thelma</li>
    <li> These are razor blades up with the razor, they go into the razor they shave my beard no other comments</li>
    <li> My husband loves these blades, says they&#x27;re the best!  And being able to get them on a subscription is terrific.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is the a great razor.  I have been using the Proglide for a few years now and love the product.  I shave my head and face daily and the razors last 3+ weeks / per without a problem.  I have tried other razors but this one fits me best. No razor burn and an outstanding shave.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain with a shave this smooth very glad I can get almost all my needs through the mail. Got a few things saved this way. And it&#x27;s a great razor I mean feel your face after amazingly smooth.</li>
    <li> I shave every day, have a heavy beard, and insist on an extremely close shave. I&#x27;m extremely particular about my razors; used to use Schick Extreme 3, which to my way of thinking were better than anything from Gillette, including the regular ProGlide. But these blades work better than anything I have ever used. Smooth, comfortable and close. The single blade on the back side makes trimming sideburns and around the nose very easy. And they last much longer than other blades, so although they are ridiculously expensive, to me it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> hands down the best razor available it is incredably sharp and has almost no snagging or pulling while shaving i would highly recommend this razor to anyone</li>
    <li> First time I used my I cut my face but a little bit.  But I think that was because I was used to having to make so many strokes to get everything.  These blades work great.  Will defiantly buy again.</li>
    <li> The Gillette&#x27;s Fusion lubricating strip absorbs water and become slippery when wet. The slippery surface increases the razor&#x27;s performance, however the lubrication expires quickly, resulting in a dry surface that makes shaving uncomfortable. I think it is foolish for expiring lubricating strips to be the reason behind frequent blade changes. I order my razors from preciseshave.com. The blades are much cheaper and I think they are just as good.</li>
    <li> While they are the perfect fit for the Gillette Fusion, I would not buy these again. They dont quite get the close shave promised and next time I would look for an alternative razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent my husband loves it , In fact ,he plans to purchase the groomer.</li>
    <li> These are great blades! They give a close shave and last a lot longer than other blades. I buy these for myself not my husband, though he likes them too. Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> NOT REAL GILLETES, CRAPPY SHAVE, BOGUS BLADES</li>
    <li> Love my overpriced disposable blades!  Switching to a more permanent Safety Razor soon for sure.</li>
    <li> Greatest blades ever.</li>
    <li> Excellent results compared to a single, double or triple blade shavers.</li>
    <li> I used this razor recently, and liked the smooth consistently of the finish on my face. I now am using this razor for a &#x27;finishing pass&#x27; after initial passes with my regular razor. This seems to be giving extended life to both blades and a super close finished shave! I can use the Fusion Proglide for about 10 days this way, and with what I&#x27;d describe as my best shaves to date.</li>
    <li> Not much better than Mack 3.....really not a good buy for the money and will stick with the previously mentioned brand</li>
    <li> Gillete Fusion Proglide is a great razor. I gave it a 4 stars rating because I felt like it took care of all my needs as a razor, but it didn&#x27;t blow my mind enough to get 5 stars. I used it as a bzz agent and therefor received it for free to try. I would probably buy it to use if it wasn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Razor for  more than a year.  I have tried&lt;br /&gt;several brand  names and I am  most  pleased with the Proglide.  I have a fast growing beardf&lt;br /&gt;and I get a clean shave always.  I have to be careful not to cut mysef (always slight) but it takes&lt;br /&gt;very little effort to contrtol the shave.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be given the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE MANUAL RAZOR to try and I feel so lucky. I have long been a fan of Gilette&#x27;s, but this new razor has given me the closest shave yet. The flexball technology really works well. After shaving my skin feels smooth and there is no irritation whatsoever. I will be using this razor exclusively from here on in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually never cut myself using these. I can just literally swoosh my face up and down. For that, I continue using Gillette. It&#x27;s just a shame they&#x27;re so expensive, it&#x27;s actually kind of ridiculous.</li>
    <li> It is what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Best razor blade. The only thing that beats this is a highly skilled barber</li>
    <li> works well but is PRICEY</li>
    <li> This is my favorite blade. You would have to work at it to cut yourself with this blade.</li>
    <li> fast service and good product, I will wait and see how I like receiving them every three months.</li>
    <li> Great blades the best I have used I did try another brand but have to say these were much much better and give a closer shave by far. Will continue to use these blades.</li>
    <li> Gillette is the bomb when it comes to this.  I&#x27;ve tried the dollar save club and didnt like their blades.</li>
    <li> In my opinion Gillette Fusion Proglide is the best razor and blades made</li>
    <li> Great blades &amp; close shave.</li>
    <li> ive tried everything to help decrease irritation as least as possible i switched to these and im satisfied on how good they work.you feel less drag when cutting the hairs and i hardly get bumps since i switched. they last pretty long i usually shave every two or three days and its been almost a month and i havent changed it yet</li>
    <li> The previous generation of these blades lasted longer - I can imagine that Gillette put a research team onto the task to redesign them for faster oblivion - the model of an inexpensive razor and overpriced blades also stinks.  Would the blades last longer it might be justified but for now I am looking for other options...</li>
    <li> Cost per blade is awful for something you use a few times and throw away.  But don&#x27;t think of that.  I use each blade for at least a week of shaving.  They work very well.  The thing I really don&#x27;t like is the packaging.  I used a table saw to cut the thing open. (Well, I thought about it!)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother-in-law.  I have similar blades and they are better than the previous models.  I enjoy them a lot, which is why I am giving them as a gift.</li>
    <li> Great price on a great product!  And I didn&#x27;t even have to go to Walmart!  What more is there to say?</li>
    <li> Great! A very nice product! Love it! You can buy it that will not regret! Very good product for sure!</li>
    <li> Gotta have em&#x27; always, makes your skin smoove!</li>
    <li> Closest shave on the market</li>
    <li> I am always impressed with the inventive design and quality of Gillette razors and blades and this is their best so far. It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use. The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change. I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up. I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Came as described...but I found cheaper at sam&#x27;s club since I ordered them .</li>
    <li> Good blades; also, received when promised.</li>
    <li> These are very good blades but there cost i s too much .</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipment!</li>
    <li> Great.  Came as advertised</li>
    <li> I have been using an electric shaver for a few years due to manual razors giving me annoying neck irritation.  After my electric shaver I got the Gillette fusion power razor.  I cannot remember the last time I had that close of a shave. The razor was smooth and amazingly no neck irritation even after I waited a few days between shaving when I was on a camping trip.  The replaceable cartridges lasted about a month between changes and the single blade makes shaving the mustache area a breeze.  As long as I can get replacement cartridges for this razor I will not be switching from the Gillette fusion power.</li>
    <li> These razors heads are the best. They last me atleast 3 months at a time so this 8 set will last for two years! Can&#x27;t beat the price I paid. These things last forever!</li>
    <li> Favorite razors out there.  Can be a bit pricey, but do an excellent job and aren&#x27;t harsh on the skin.</li>
    <li> This is my hubby&#x27;s favorite razor-head to use!!  He has very sensitive skin, and his beard-hair is thick and runs in several directions.  This blade does the least amount of damage to his face...close, clean shave with minimal blood and virtually no razor-burn.</li>
    <li> Excellent in time delivery</li>
    <li> As advertised, quick shipment, great product. Recommended seller.</li>
    <li> costly! but last long.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, the Proglide razor is much better than the regular Fusion shaver.  I get a much closer shave with the Proglide.  I think it has to do with the material used in making the blades compared to the regular Fusion.  The Proglide is sharper and lasts a lot longer. I am unsure if the Proglide blades are interchangeable with the regular Fusion shaver or not, if so, try the Proglide blades.</li>
    <li> Excellent just the cost</li>
    <li> Schick and Gillette... Hydro vs. Fusion.  I love them both and alternate between them on a monthly basis for the same \\&quot;feel\\&quot; is very different between the 2 brands.  Prices are comparable.  I&#x27;m a big fan of both and the price here on Amazon was by far the best i saw in a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette Proglide for awhile. Great product. Annoying that razors are expensive in general. Worth the buy though these things are great.</li>
    <li> As an African-American man with sensitive skin, i am very cautious about the razor I use. I love this one. No issues.</li>
    <li> Probably this fake or low quality version, not as good as one I got with razor.&lt;br /&gt;buying from walmart may be a better option</li>
    <li> Beats out paying retail!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this razor ever since we got one free in the mail over 10 years ago.  We&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. It does a great job, lasts longer than any other razors we&#x27;ve used.  Will most definitely continue to keep buying.</li>
    <li> I am on number 5 of 8 and so far, 4 out of the 5 that I have used have dulled quickly and the comfort strip has started coming off after just a couple of shaves.  I had bought the same blades from somewhere else and they lasted quite some time (about 8-10 weeks per blade) and the blades dulled out before the comfort strip wore out.  These are barely lasting 4 weeks, and the last two weeks are near agony with the dullness and the lack of a comfort strip.  I&#x27;m hoping it was just a bad batch.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> I use these blades a lot with my double edge razor, the blades seem to work well as clean pass thru.</li>
    <li> Great blades that do the job with minimal irritation and are relatively durable (4-6 times use). I would highly recommend this product...</li>
    <li> At 18, I started shaving with disposable two-blade razors (and probably even the safety razor once) and moved up to Sensor Excels, Mach 3 and all the way up to Fusion Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept getting nicks and cuts with Fusion Power (never figured why) and also felt the shave wasn&#x27;t as close (maybe because the 5 blade head was too big to navigate) and for a while went back to Mach 3. After Fusion Proglide came out I thought I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with the Fusion Proglide Power. Definitely smoother, closer and way more confortable shave than both Fusion Power and Mach 3.</li>
    <li> I love these blades.  I have been using them now for over a year, and not a single time have they cut me nor given me razor burn.  They are long-lasting and a quality product for a reasonable price (not cheap for sure) but since they do last a while you get value.  I have never had a better shave than I have had with these blades.  I can highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Great Blade, gives smooth shave. I have used these Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades off and on for a few years.  I would use all the time, except they are a bit pricey.  I would highly recommend these blades.  Much better than all other blades I have used.</li>
    <li> Have used these blades for some time. They give a very clean shave and last a resonable time. Great price also.</li>
    <li> The best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and with 8 cartridges per pack, I&#x27;m good for at least 10 months. Nice!</li>
    <li> I may be one of only a few people to give a negative review of the Fusion Proglide, but I put a lot of effort into researching, selecting and trying shaving products of all types. Guys, in the grand scheme of things this razor is not that good. It&#x27;s not even Gillette&#x27;s best razor. Perhaps that&#x27;s why the company in the past few months has shifted its advertising away from the Proglide line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few considerations:&lt;br /&gt;- What I call \\&quot;paddle-type\\&quot; razors (such as the Fusion series and Schick Hydro) are remarkably inefficient due to the geometry of the razor handle. Look at older razors like Gillette&#x27;s Sensor series, Atra and even the DE safety razors. The razor neck is at a pronounced angle, which ensures uniform contact and pressure with the face. Paddle-style razors are flat the length of the handle, thus causing the average user to drag the blades over the face. This speeds deterioration of the leading blade (so you&#x27;ll buy more refills) and also impacts closeness of the shave (so you&#x27;ll buy more blades per cartridge).&lt;br /&gt;- If your face is prone to ingrown hairs, this is simply not the razor for you. I don&#x27;t care what kind of marketing Gillette puts out; moving that many metal blades across your face every day is torture for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;- While I&#x27;ve already stated above my issues with the Proglide handle, I do compliment Gillette on making it grippy with a good length and weight.&lt;br /&gt;- The individual unit price in a box of Proglide refills is nearly $4.00 per cartridge. Just let that sink in for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The takeaway from my review is that I encourage thinking outside the mainstream on which razor you use. Just because a company says it&#x27;s their best product doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that&#x27;s actually the case. For me, I pair Gillette&#x27;s Sensor3 with a high-quality shave gel and get very close shaves each morning with no irritation. Try something different like that -- your face might just thank you.</li>
    <li> Anyone using a Gillette Fusion Proglide knows the spiraling cost of replacement blades.  Although I purchased more than I normally would at one time it is very well worth the savings.</li>
    <li> Simply put, this is the best razor that has ever touched my boyishly handsome face. I will continue to buy and use these until I find something superior.</li>
    <li> When it comes to shaving, I tend to be slow to embrace changes, since it&#x27;s taken many years to find the right combination of blades and shaving cream that I can use without drawing blood in the pre-dawn hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed to \\&quot;standard\\&quot; [[ASIN:B004B891MA Fusion blades]] a few years ago only when I could no longer reliably find my old standby [[ASIN:B007VT2SQM Excel]] blades in brick and mortar stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion Proglide \\&quot;evolution\\&quot; seems to be one of upward trending price only. Other than a difference in color, I haven&#x27;t noticed an appreciable difference in either the closeness of the shave or the lifetime of the cartridge over its standard Fusion predecessor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is fine, but I don&#x27;t notice enough improvement in the experience to justify the extra cost vs. the Fusion.</li>
    <li> These seem to be the same razors that you get at any Kroger or Walmart store and they seem to last the same amount of time at a better price.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. Now trying Dollar Shave Club to see how it compares then may order this again or not.</li>
    <li> Works like they are supposed to.  Nice close shave, the best in my opinion</li>
    <li> I have been using these Gillette Fusion Proglide razors for a while now and I am pleased. I make sure they are sold and shipped by Amazon and I have never gotten fakes. If I dry the cartridge after shaving, it will last me around two months before I replace them so I believe they are worth the price to me since I can shave quickly and without cutting myself.</li>
    <li> This cuts your hair well.</li>
    <li> Expensive, YES, but lasts all day long!</li>
    <li> How can you improve a tried and true shave? Here&#x27;re it is, I&#x27;ve never been one to fall for gimmicks or &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;, but this blade is better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I really love the close shave that I get with these blades, and the price that I paid is much better than what I can get in local stores.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Mach 3 Turbo for the last 8 years.  If I go more than 5 days of shaving, my neck always ends up breaking out in razor bumps.  I switched over to the Fusion ProGlide a couple of weeks ago and couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!  I&#x27;ll even shave on the weekends!  It&#x27;s so smooth.  Irritation is almost zero or very minor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Glad it wasn&#x27;t a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Great product at a fantastic price with lightening fast shipping!!  Great seller!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very good blades. I put them on the power handle with no problem.</li>
    <li> Closest shave I have ever gotten.  No nicks.  The only issue I had was under the nose and sideburns.  A little difficult to get those tight spots.</li>
    <li> Actually last a while.  I have super thick facial hair and I find these blades last longer than most (most go dull the after the first shave). Recommend the initial investment in the Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide razor.  I have also tried home delivery razors.  I found their best razors dull more quickly-for me anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a scam but all of the manufacturers are in on it. Price fixing at its finest</li>
    <li> Works great, as expected</li>
    <li> Cleanest shave ive ever had and they last two weeks!</li>
    <li> it gives best shave&lt;br /&gt;arrived in time&lt;br /&gt;and subscription offer is great saves a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;packaging was good</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Cartridge eight count....comparable price from where i normaly buy but much easier to just order and have it shipped to home not more running out of razors.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this is exactly what I have been needing.  I no longer get those razor burns.</li>
    <li> I bought these refills for my husband, but Gillette is my favorite brand anyway. Even I use their (men&#x27;s) razors! It really hacks through the hair on my legs :)</li>
    <li> I guess proglide are the best razor head blades. I bought other razors but proglide really feels good and does a great job! Just wish these were little less pricy though.</li>
    <li> WOW! I just got this Proglide from a program run by Gillette, and let me tell you for a guy that suffers from nicks and cuts for the last 8 years due to a thick beard; this blade was awesome! I was skeptical at first having seen all the commercials I thought it was all hype but no this is the real deal. I only had to run it down my face one time,usually with other razors I had to run it down my face 3-4 times but not with this one. I have never felt such a smooth shave like I did with this one, it was like cutting through warm butter and after using it a few time I feel awesome and believe I found a new razor. No cuts, no razor bumps, and best of all a great shave without razor burn! This beats any manual or electric razor out there hands down! Guys I highly recommend you get this and become a ProGlide believer like I have.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor is almost the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, second only to the Fusion ProGlide POWER razor. I received a free ProGlide through a promotion and it&#x27;s a really good shave. I have sensitive skin and other razors give me redness on my neck, but not this one. I use this razor to shave my head as well and get a very close shave without cutting myself. The extra blade is very nice for keeping the edges of my beard cleaned up as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the razor for a few days now I received it as a promotion being run by Gillette and it has been working great . It&#x27;s got 5 blades and one for edging on the top.iv used it multiple times and its stayed pretty sharp the entire time. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it when it&#x27;s time to by new cartridges I like it that much !</li>
    <li> Gillette has been my blade of choice since my early teens. My father gave me a Gillette Atra and I have been a user since.  This newest blade Fusion Proglide is a saviour for me to continue being a Gillette customer.  This blade lasts 30 days!  I was having a tough time paying so much money on the former fusion blade.  Alas not only is the Proglide is a better blade...Gillette has given us a shelf life. Which is a month!  This is great news.  While Gillette is no doubt a great company.  I was becoming increasingly irritated by the increasing prices.  I know that they put a lot of research in to improving their products.  But seeing all the pricey celebrity endorsements and knowing it has to be paid for by somebody. ..well it was just too much.  But this is a step forward.  I will pay for a great blade with A month expiration.</li>
    <li> After receiving the razor through Gillette I opened right away and experienced a clean smooth shave. Better than any disposable razor or electric razor. Smoothest shave I have ever had</li>
    <li> The blades are super sharp and you get the smoothest shave you ever had!Definetly worth the price.I love it!You will too.</li>
    <li> I tried this only because it was supplied to me free through a program by Gillette, but I am sure glad I did! These blades cut closer and more comfortable than any other that I have used. They also rinse clean easier. The trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge was very handy for tight spots and precision shaving. This was my best shave yet.</li>
    <li> This may be the best razor I&#x27;ve used.  I was able to get a very close shave very quickly, with no skin irritation.  I got the razor directly from Gillette.  I&#x27;ve used their razors before, and I feel like this one stands above their others.  Would definitely recommend the ProGlide.</li>
    <li> This razor is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t pull or tug. I received it from a special offer from Gillette, and Iam super happy!</li>
    <li> I have tried many types of razors. This one has got to be the best. Very close shave. The 5 blades really do the trick.I highly recommend This shaver.</li>
    <li> I received the ProFusion blade to try from a Gillette run program.  I&#x27;m really impressed with the performance of the blade.  The blade gives a smooth comfortable, close shave.  So smooth that it takes less time to shave.  No irritation or razor bumps.  The blade gave a closer shave than I have ever felt.  The blade is small enough to get the had to shave above lip area.&lt;br /&gt;the only downside is the cost.  This blade cost a lot more than my usual blades.  I would definitly purchase if I find them on sale or with coupons.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Mach3 for years and I love it, I got this for free from a program run by Gillette and I figured I would try it but to be honest the head of the razor is big and clunky. I felt like it was a pain to get into the corners. It did have a smooth shave but I felt that it wasn&#x27;t as maneuverable.</li>
    <li> The Fusion Pro Glide makes that dreaded task of shaving not so bad. The blades are sharp and really do \\&quot;glide\\&quot; over your face. I do not get that tug and pull on my sensitive skin with the blades of the Fusion Pro Glide.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I received the Fusion Proglide free from Gillette for evaluation purposes.  I usually use a three-blade cartridge, which does an OK job... unless I forget to shave for a few days or have to shave without showering first.  Those times, there is definite pull and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty skeptical of the \\&quot;more blades are better\\&quot; push, but I have to say that this cartridge handled the two areas mentioned above a lot smoother than my usual razor.  I also noticed fewer cuts with this cartridge, probably because I had to put less effort into shaving.  I didn&#x27;t use the precision trimmer much, but I can see how it could be useful in keeping sideburns sharp.  I don&#x27;t know the price point for these cartridges, but depending on the cost they may be well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Gillette actually mailed me a free trial of their blade and I was definitely pleased with the results. I normally use an electric razor but after using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide, I absolutely plan on purchasing more. I recommend trying it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I just received a Fusion Proglide razor from a program run by Gillette. Every time I saw a commercial for newer thiner blades I was always skeptical of how much it made a difference but when I got these it all made sense. The new cartridges are great, the lubricant strip doesn&#x27;t go white so fast and the bottom part is made out of like a softer rubber or something so it doesn&#x27;t pull on my skin so much. it sounds girly but I have sensitive skin and the new design is alot easier on my skin. Theres still just five blades but there noticeably thinner so it gets closer and if you havent shaved in a while it doesnt tug on the hair as much. as a side note the new cartridges fit on the old handle also. All in all the new cartridges are legit</li>
    <li> Okay! Okay! I KNOW that&#x27;s a corny title, but it is TRUE. I received a freebie Gillette Pro Glide razor from Gillette for testing. I have been using throw-away razors for years because I thought they were all just alike. My shaves have been just okay at best. I have a HEAVY and dark beard and it grows ffffast. I normally have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 3. Shaving is a REAL chore and I hate it, but NOT any longer. With this Gillette Pro Glide razor it is EASY and SMOOTH. I get a close shave with NO nicks or pulls. My shadow stays hidden until at least 9 o&#x27;clock now which is a GREAT improvement. This thing HAD to be designed by space engineers because they thought of EVERYTHING from the lubristrip for that extra lubrication, channels for ease of cleaning, to the weighted handle for superior balance. I guess the BEST recommendation for a product is if the person who tried it will continue to USE it. I recently went out and purchased a pack of Pro Glide cartridges and intend on using it from now on. One of the best products I have used in a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a promotion being provided by Gillette, i got to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual cartridge for free,which gave me a very close and comfortable shave. Despite that i have sensitive skin, it did not cause any redness, nor did it cut my face. My skin felt smooth and looked healthier. I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I love gillete proglide. it works great on my skin and is very smooth at  getting every last hair. it is my favorite!</li>
    <li> I received my razor from a promotion from Gillette and let me tell you the happiness I felt. I know it&#x27;s just a razor but anyone with a beard and sensitive skin knows how difficult it is to find a quality razor. The blades felt so smooth, no knicks or cuts. I didn&#x27;t even get one razor bump which I normally get with other razors. The handle had an awesome grip and was easy to maneuver when lining up my beard. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. I know I won&#x27;t be buying any other razor than the Gillette Fusion ProGlide..thank you gillette</li>
    <li> Gillette keeps getting better and better the Fusion Proglide is great. Four thin sharp razors just glides over my face grooming to the curves. I shave just about every day and wow this razor is great.</li>
    <li> I love this razor...it provided a great, close shave that was superior to the other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> This is cheaper and more convenient than going to a brick and mortar store to buy blades. It also comes out a bit cheaper as well.</li>
    <li> The shave is a 5 star, I just continue to feel that Gillette overcharges for all blades--forcing the consumer to try to buy at the best available price and this package does just that.</li>
    <li> These refills by far give you the closest shave ever. Went from the Mach 3 to the Proglide and I am very satified with them. The only downside is they are a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Daile shavers save money here. I shave daily,, man this is so robust that i am still using the 1st one since last 6 months. Planning to throw it now.. good stuff.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and comfortable.  The previous set which I complained about was defective.  It pulled my whiskers and left my face very raw.  The latest set of blades does what its supposed to do.  Comfort and great shave</li>
    <li> A good quality razor, but a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> Love these blades, that is really all that needs to be said...maybe it should also be mentioned that this price was cheaper than the walmart in my area.</li>
    <li> It was as I suspected A1 plus nothing but the best as always keep on keeping on and do not let any thing get in the way of you handling and keeping good products, see yaaaaaa..........</li>
    <li> Bought a pack of 8 blades before Christmas as a gift, and just found out from the recipient that the blades do not have the same sharpness or glide that the ones bought at retail have. Wouldn&#x27;t have thought there would be this issue when it&#x27;s a straight Amazon purchase. These blades are not inexpensive, but they certainly are cheap.  Would not buy here again.  Not a happy customer!</li>
    <li> great deal, works awesome</li>
    <li> You know what youre getting, and the price is the lowest i have seen (unless youre actively searching)&lt;br /&gt;these are authentic and work just like the ones we buy at the store for $5 a pop</li>
    <li> Always use these. Have for a long time. Love the glide strips and the amount of blades. Smooth.</li>
    <li> I have these blades on auto shipment which is nice. I wish they lasted longer though. These can get dull pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> My husband needed replacement cartridges for his razor. These are a good price for the package, we love shopping for toiletries like this item on Amazon as the prices here are so much better than retail stores. We use subscribe and save which makes it cheaper and you do not have to remember to buy or run out.</li>
    <li> Overall, the cost of the replacement blades kills the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor was provided free to me as part of a review promotion by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a better shave but the replacement blades make it hard to justify the cost. While this razor provided the BEST shave I ever had it&#x27;s too expensive for the average consumer. The reason why the shave is so good is that the blades are placed closer together than other razor blade systems like the Mach 3. I think if they came out with a 3 blade razor where the blades were close together as they are on the Gillette Fusion ProGlide (to reduce the cost) they would have a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a 5-Star if not for the cost.</li>
    <li> A Gillette Fusion Proglide razor was provided to me for free through a Gillette-ran program. Before using the razor, I had only heard good comments about it, but now I have formed my own opinion.  I immediately noticed the difference. The new razor glided through my facial hair with plenty of ease and barely any tugs or pulls. I also recognized that it&#x27;s flexibility provided a closer shave in those tricky, hard to reach spots. Lastly, my skin feels much smoother and looks even healthier than it did after using normal razors. I was left with no bumps and a fresh shave. I highly recommend using the Gillette Fusion Proglide. There will be no disappointment with this razor!</li>
    <li> best thing for sensitive skin! its thinner blades has no tug or pull of thick coarse facial hair! used it twice in a week because of its sleek design! very impressed!!! best part is i can&#x27;t believe it was FREE! provided by Gillette... i am now a new user and firm believer this is the blade for ME!!!</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide through a program run by gillette and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The extra blade on the cartridge really reduces any irritation it all when shaving. I went almost a month without changing cartridges...Definitely worth the money and I would not be willing to try anything else at the moment</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found the Gillette Fusion ProGlide. The blades shae every single hair without missing a beat. It is the closest and smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. It keep the skin feeling soft and makes you forget you had stubble to begin with.</li>
    <li> I received the proglide as part of a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In truth this razor has 6 blades if you count the close trim blade at the tip of the razor.  This is my favorite feature as it allows you to do some nice touch up work.  I especially appreciate this as I have a beard and being able to keep it nice and clean looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think the 5 blades is a little excessive.  But that could just be me and what I am accustomed to.  I prefer the Mach 3, but I have been using it for a long time.  I do have to admit the lubrication strip makes the shave really smooth so far.  Overall, an excellent product!</li>
    <li> This free razor sent by Gillette was a delightful suprise.  The blade was so smooth, that I could hardly tell I was using it.  There were no nicks and cuts.  This was a good experience and I will look for this product in the future.  I am hoping this blade lasts a good long while.  I also like how the handle fit into my hand.  It was comfortable.</li>
    <li> Loved it. The first time I used the cartridge my beard was about a half inch. I figure it would just plug the razer, but it didn&#x27;t. The blades are spaced perfectly so they don&#x27;t plug up. I have already used three times which I have never done with any other razer in the past.</li>
    <li> The Gillette ProGlide is second only to a straight shave at my local barber. These cartridges also attach to the original style handle, so no need to purchase the entire system. these new Fusion blades leave a truly smooth shave, even in the \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; that other razors leave feeling stubbly.</li>
    <li> As someone with sensitive skin I decided to try out the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor, which was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely noticed the improvements that Gillette made to the new cartridge. The lubrastrip did a great job in softening my skin and there was no bumps on my skin after shaving. However I did not see much difference in maintaining tricky spots with the re-designed precision trimmer and I noticed that the lubrastrip was providing too much lubricant on my neck. This made shaving my neck harder than usual, but still manageable. Overall the cartridge seems better than previous Fusion cartridge, but the lubrastrip might work a little too well.</li>
    <li> I recently participated in a program run by Gillette to try their Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge. I can say that I am disappointed. The blades did not give me a close shave and the moisture strip left a slimy feeling on my face. I expected a better product from Gillette than this. I don;t know if I would recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> I normally shave using an electric shaver, but for times when I need a close shave I prefer to use cartridge razors. When I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide handle that was provided to me by a program being ran by Gillette in the mail the other day, I decided to give it a try before a big meeting at work the next morning. Overall, the handle was great. It was very comfortable and handled very well, especially around the more angled parts of my face such as my jaw line. The blades didn&#x27;t seem to clog up like other brands typically do. A simple rinse in the water was enough to clear it out. The blades were able to get very close to my skin and left it very smooth. The best part is that I didn&#x27;t seem to have any razor burn afterwards. I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this product. Overall, when compared to other cartridge razors I have used in the past, this one stands out and I will likely use it again.</li>
    <li> i got this razor the other day and at first I didn&#x27;t think that it would be as good as it was. but with the first few shaves I fell for it my skin was smooth and I loved how that felt people noticed right away. so to me this is a great razor to use!</li>
    <li> I got this razor free in a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;It is more of a mans razor but I used it on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;I got a super close shave. The blades did not tug or pull on the skin but glided&lt;br /&gt;over the skin so smoothly that I also did not need shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;The lubricating strip does a great job and seemed to make the shave that much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are close and since the razor did not slip in my hand no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to hide this one from my husband and I will buy him one of his own but this one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Smooth, comfortable shave with no irritation.  Comfort strip lasts longer than current blades. Very ergonomic handle and broad cartridge attachment really help reach trouble spots like jawbone.</li>
    <li> So I have used the Gillette Fusion before, and it was of course their best razor out at the time, but it still had the same problem I&#x27;ve always had with razors, which is the tugging of my facial hair when shaving. So I decided to give this razor a shot since it was provided to me from a special Gillette Program, and here&#x27;s what I can say about it. I have very prickly/straight facial hair as well, so there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of \\&quot;going with the grain\\&quot; which adds to the hair tugging, and this is always my problem with manual razors. I just tried out this new ProGlide version, and I kind of expected it to be the same, but the tugging was almost completely non-existent, to my surprise! The blade itself felt and looked just like the other Fusion&#x27;s, except this new version gave me a much smoother and \\&quot;ouchless\\&quot; shave. I usually use an electric shaver, but it doesn&#x27;t get as close and sometimes I need that close-shave super clean look, and now I can get it without the hair-tugging hassle. The best part about this? I received this razor for free simply for giving it a try and an honest review! Great job Gillette and thank you!</li>
    <li> I got this razor and cartridge as a free sample through a program run by Gillette and I really love it.  First of all, the cartridge is easy to get on and off of the handle.  Secondly, it performs very well.  I shave while in the shower and these blades glide smoothly and cuts hair (even my coarse beard) like butter, without pulling hairs.  Best of all, my skin, after shaving is clearer...no ingrown hairs or razor burn.  I am going to stick with this razor cartridge for a long time!</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with shaving especially with my sensitive skin! I decided to purchase this even though it was a little more expensive than competitors, but it is worth the shave! I absolutely love this razor, easy to navigate across my face and no cuts! Every time I shave I cut myself, except this one, even after a week of no shaving, this razor does the job perfectly! A must have for all men! UPDATE- It has been a few weeks since I posted this review, but I can&#x27;t put this razor down! This past weekend my daughter graduated and I wanted to look nice for her, so I went almost a week without shaving, and put it to the test, I did not regret it! I did not develop a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow until the next night, I was so smooth! I love this razor so much!</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try these blades as part of a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;  A little hesitant because of the horrible experience I&#x27;ve had in the past with manual blades. but decided to give these a try anyway based on the description,and the fact that they were free. Still not having to much hope that I would actually like then since I&#x27;ve been using an electric razor for so long. I prepared myself for the worse and gave them a try anyway. wow! not one cut or scratch and my sensitive skin didnt burn as much as it had with other razor cartridges. And the close shave I got from these cartridges means I wont have to shave as often as I did with my electric razor I was using before I discovered these cartridges. Love when I discover a product that actually does what its advertised to do.</li>
    <li> My wife signed me up to receive a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor to try through a program run by Gillette, and I must say it was the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. The cartridge blades seemed perfectly aligned and I didn&#x27;t get a single cut while shaving. The lubrastrip was very moisturizing and skin softening, and was so smooth that there was no pull and tug that I usually experience with other razors. The cartridge also lasts for a very long time without dulling or rusting, making this product extremely high quality. Will definitely continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I tried this product as part of a promotional program through Gillette. The 5-blade cartridge with precision trimmer has a nice soothing aloe strip and offers a super close shave. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week now and it still stays super sharp. Definitely the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide through a special program offered by Gillette.  In preparation for this I allowed my beard to grow for a longer period than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get through the process quickly and with only one cartridge.  The cartridge was easy to clean and remained sharp and ready during the entire process.  The lubrication strip helped protect my skin and I didn&#x27;t develop and redness or irritation after shaving.  Another nice feature was the small trimming blade on the top of the cartridge.  This was great for shaping and getting areas that were missed by the main blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great razor and the lubrication works perfectly to protect sensitive skin that otherwise becomes irritated after shaving.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide free as part of a promotion from Gillette. I must admit that the handle is&lt;br /&gt;one of the better balanced handles I&#x27;ve encountered for a shaver. The rubber grip keeps it from falling out of your hands or slipping while shaving.  It felt comfortable to use. Definitely a cut above the rest</li>
    <li> I have used clippers to shave even though they don&#x27;t give the smoothest shave since they do not give me bumps. Then I got a free Fusion ProGlide to try. Sure enough it was smoother than my clippers but the part i liked the most is the absence of razor burn and bumps after using it. The curving of the cartridge also helps it to get to all parts especially under the jaws and on the neck.I recommend this anyone who has a sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide via program run by Gillette.  First time using the Proglide razor.  Very close and smooth shave. No nicks or cuts.  No slip grip makes it easy to control.  Blades are sharp but will not cut your face if used correctly.  A+ review for this razor.  Will purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> The overall razor is great, but the blades are one of the best i have ever used! If you take care of them, as in drying and cleaning them they will last a good long time. They are easy to replace and clean, the blue strip has moisturizing oil in it and makes your face feel amazing after the shave. I have never had a set of blades cut this well and so close before. Great job Gillette, you just got yourselves a future customer.</li>
    <li> This shave was very good for someone with a thick beard. The lubricating strip could last longer, but otherwise this was a good razor.</li>
    <li> I got a free razor from a program run by Gillette, and the new thinner blades of this razor makes shaving painless.</li>
    <li> Usually I&#x27;m skeptical about every new razor&#x27;s boasting about new features like new blade technology, vibration features, new lubricating technology, etc.  But the Fusion ProGlide is the real deal.  I&#x27;ve finally found a razor for my sensitive skin that won&#x27;t leave me raw and bloodied after I&#x27;m done shaving.  I&#x27;ll soon be cancelling my Dollar Shave Club subscription for sure!</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from a program run by Gillette.  I am normally an electric razor guy, but I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.  After using it a few times, I can say it works well, but it is no better than many of the other razors on the market.  It does a good job, but I do get a little irritation from it.  It seems to do a good job cutting the hair, but I still have a few problem spots that I have to go over a few times.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t change back to using a manual razor from the electric, and if I did, I would only use these cartridges if they were cheaper than the other competition, I wouldn&#x27;t pay more for them.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette razors since I have started shaving. I started with the simple three blade heads and I decided I would treat myself to a more \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot; shaving experience. The 5 blades of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide are conducive to a close shave and smooth skin after. I really like the versatility of the cartridge too, for it moves and adapts well to the contours of my face, chin, and jawline. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is if you have much more than a stubble, the razor seems to catch much more than does the 3 blade cartridge. Other than that, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge is definitely the way to go!</li>
    <li> i received this razor via gillette to give it a test run. its amazing!! no razor burn, not cuts, smooth skin, the works!!! love it!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Cartridge was supplied to me by a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are easy to use and do not pull on my facial or body hair.  They are easy to change and dispose of through a simple click.  The blades are also extremely comfortable because they have multiple blades and gel built in.  This combination of technology creates a very comfortable and easy shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who shaves.</li>
    <li> These Blades provide a smooth shave when used with the Fusion ProGlide Styler. They will replace my current blades that I will not be using any more. I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Cartridges for free via a program run by Gillette. I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
    <li> I recently received a FREE Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor via a program run by Gillette and have to say... I&#x27;ve tried several different brands, styles and types of razors and can honestly say, the Gillete Fusion ProGlide razor and blade cartridge were EXTREMELY easy to use, clean and most importantly guarantee a smooth shave. I had no problems, cuts, nicks or maintenance issues with this razor. The blades seem to be very reliable and easy to clean, allowing for a smooth shave with consistent use! I highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> the Razor Was Amazing. didn&#x27;t miss a single hair. the smooth handling allowed for easy gliding threw my chin. and was very flexible and when i finally shaved i had no irritation what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;Their is nothing negative i have to say about this razor.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that a free Razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillete.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how many people received it but I received one razor and only one blade which worked out great for me. I&#x27;m not sure if people got more then that but that&#x27;s what was sent for me to try. With what I had I love this product and would have anyone try this out.</li>
    <li> I got this free from a program ran by Gillette. Good, sharp blades that cut perfectly... most of the time. Perhaps it is because of the number of blades, but it clogs up with my lathering shave lotion. Still, they go for forever, and do their job quite well, especially compared to Schick blades. So for this, Gillette wins.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide through a program run by Gillette and am not disappointed. The 5 blades provide my face with the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had at home while the single blade does a great job at trimming tough, intricate areas like the sideburns and the upper lip. The only problem I&#x27;ve run into is that the single blade can get clogged relatively easily.</li>
    <li> I often use Gillette shave products, and this product was provided to me free via a promotion by the company. These blades are very smooth and easy to use, even for someone like myself with shaky hands and sensitive skin. Unfortunately, the blades did not last as long as I would have expected. I found the blades difficult to use after about a week (shaving every other day). I think the blades remained sharp, but the protective gel was worn out fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually an electric razor kind of guy, but when I was offered a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual razor through a program run by Gillette, I figured I would give it a try.  Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it gives you a very smooth, close shave--most places. The problem for me was that my facial hair is very coarse (which I&#x27;m assuming most guy&#x27;s facial hair is as well) so the blades clogged very easily. It got to the point that I would have to bang the blade on the side of the sink after every stroke to free the hair stuck in between. I&#x27;m sure this damaged the blades and shortened the life of the razor. I would end up having to shave my face twice, basically, to go back and get the spots that the razor didn&#x27;t get due to it being clogged. I also had a hard time getting those hard-to-reach areas. Supposedly the precision trimmer has been redesigned but I couldn&#x27;t find it at all on my cartridge. Overall 2 stars for the close shave, but its a flop on the rest.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  The fusion proglide is a great razor for bald people.  Clean cut no stray hairs.  Very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> well I got this from a program that was being ran by Gillette, and to tell the truth I would not buy this ever, the blades suck and that is it I did not have a good shave with them at all.</li>
    <li> with the fusion proglide razor my rash that follows shaving is no more. excellent job gillette with the fusion proglide razor, very comfortable shave</li>
    <li> Just when you thought it couldn&#x27;t get any better. I get a free razor from Gillette via a program run by Gillette. I have never had as smooth a shave as you get from this razor. The refills are a little pricey but you don&#x27;t mind spending a little extra for the results that you get and the blade even last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette</li>
    <li> The hing design was a great feature, it gave a very close shave. The blades are space far enough appart to allow the hair(s) to rinse off the blades.</li>
    <li> Right or wrong, I typically shave in the evening after my facial hair has been softened by a hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;Gillette sent me a new razor to try, switching to a new razor always feels great but this ProGlide razor has worked better than my last Fusion razor in a few ways.&lt;br /&gt;My old razor would get plugged up after just a few passes and would require cleaning with a small brush. With this new ProGlide razor I&#x27;ve shaved half my face and it washed clean with just hot water.&lt;br /&gt;During the winter I typically grow a beard just because I dislike shaving that much. In the past I&#x27;ve shaved every other night but my beard was pretty thick that second night. I&#x27;ve been able to stretch it to every third day with this new razor. I&#x27;m not clean shaven by that third day but it&#x27;s certainly acceptable for me.&lt;br /&gt;Going against the grain was also easier with this razor.  Gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;There razor on the back is handy for trimming my sideburns but gets plugged up.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide is an excellent razor as it glides through the skin in a very smooth manner. Recently I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge along with the handle via a program run by Gillette and was very excited to try it out. Compared to my normal blade this product definitely makes a difference. I tend to cut myself a lot when I shave, but when I tried out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I saw no blood. My face was clean of cuts and it was due to the change in razors. I also appreciate that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide shaves as close to the skin as possible. When I shave I try to get it the shortest I can to make it last. The thing that bothers me the most is leaving some facial hairs a bit longer because the razor doesn&#x27;t cut them. However, with this product that is no longer a problem. And it even leaves my skin feeling smooth and healthy. With the re-designed precision trimmer I was able to shave and get my sideburns trimmed all at once without having to pull out an extra trimmer. I am pretty much set for life. Once my blades are no longer sharp I can easily replace them and keep the same handle.</li>
    <li> I have used alot of different razors over the years, this one really does a great job. It is a very smooth and close shave. This is a razor that i use a few times through out the week. Highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a program Gillette was having I was able to try out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Cartridges for free! I must say I have tried numerous razor blades before but these ones are spectacular!  They offer a close and clean shave that just cleans my face with one pass. Also, the razors do not ever tug on the facial har it just glides over your face. I would defiantly recommend these razor blades to anyone who wants a nice clean shave!</li>
    <li> I have used the regular fusion (not the pro-glide) for several years and have been reasonably happy with it. I received this offer for a free pro-glide razor from Gillette and jumped at the chance for it. My expectations going in was there is no way I will be able to tell a difference in razors. I let myself go for 5 days to really put it to the test. I was surprised on how smooth the shave was. I could definitely tell a difference between the fusion and the pro-glide. The Pro-glide has a very smooth shave with little to no pulling at all. I will definitely choose the pro-glide when razor shopping in the future.</li>
    <li> I shave every other day. These blades are great. I love the detailing blade on the back side also. I enjoyed the blades so much I gave some to my brother to try. He said he couldn&#x27;t believe how close the shave was and that it didn&#x27;t irritate his skin. Great blade Gillette</li>
    <li> Works great.  Gives a nice clean shave.  I wish I could get a few more shaves out of it before needing to replace it, but it gives about 6-7 good shaves before it needs replaced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver for a long time now, but I received this razor as a gift of sorts and I cannot believe how well it does the job. Smooth, comfortable and and with a lasting blade. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I really love these razor cartridges. I&#x27;ve been using the Mach 3 for years, tried (thanks to a gillette promo program I got one for free) a proglide cartridge and I loved how it actually glid along my face while shaving. These actually gave me a closer shave than my mach 3 blades. Love &#x27;em</li>
    <li> i love how close of a shave you get with this razor leaves you with a smooth feeling skin i am definitely changing razors. I really like how close the shave is and how comfortable it is to use the blades also.&lt;br /&gt;lasts for almost a month. More expensive up front, but you have to replace it less often, and it makes for a much better shave in the end. i will buy again- m. capra&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;son loves this razor as well he has one of his own, and likes it much better than the other one he was using.</li>
    <li> This product I received free from a program run by Gillette and I&#x27;m hooked on this product. It works great and gives me a close shave when I need it. My job requires that I have a clean shave and this product does it job!</li>
    <li> I liked this razor. It gave me a smooth, close shave that lasted a couple of days. I think it worked better than my regular Gillette Fusion razor. I received this razor free from a program ran by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Having tried, and not liked, the Gillette Fusion Power I was quite skeptical about the ProGlide. So much so had I not been sent a free test  Fusion ProGlide by Gillette I may have skipped this one altogether. Boy I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t as this has become my new favorite razor hands down. Where the Gillette Fusion Power failed, this razor makes up for ten fold. When I tried the Fusion power it wasn&#x27;t a smooth shave. In fact it almost felt as if the blades were not cutting, but actually pulling out my hairs. As you can imagine I threw it out after only one use returning to my Mach 3. I realize the Mach 3 is a dinosaur, but until finding the Gillette Fusion ProGlide it was my razor of choice. Not anymore. Where the Fusion Power failed, the ProGlide makes up for. It shaves smooth and clean getting even the hardest to reach areas without any pain. Never once did it feel like it was ripping my follicles by the root. Afterwards I noticed it even shaved closer than any of my previous razors could. I was smoother than I have been since before I started shaving. Not believing it, I tried again and again. Each time I would get similar results. A close shave without any of the pain. I cannot recommend this razor more.</li>
    <li> I tend to get in grown hairs on my face from time to time. And I&#x27;ve tried everything to help decrease irritation. I&#x27;m satisfied on how good these blades work. I feel less drag when shaving and I hardly get bumps since I switched. I get a close clean shave. They are pretty expensive though so I try to make them last. I will continue to use this product. I received these blades as part of a Gillette program.</li>
    <li> I love Gillette!  Such a great product &amp; razor. Got one from the Bzz Campaign and I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor from a program run by Gillette. It is by far the best manual razor I have ever used. It offers a smooth shave and is incredibly sharp. It also lasts longer than other razors I have used. I would recommend this razor to anyone who shaves at least twice a week. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I like many others thought this provided an excellent first second and maybe third shave however a while after it cut much less and lesser well. I will buy them again if the price is good enough.</li>
    <li> I had a chance to try out this razor lately, and for free it was quite worth while.&lt;br /&gt;I got a very smooth shave and several uses out of one cartridge. The small back blade was especially useful&lt;br /&gt;for detailing near my nose.  It didn&#x27;t seem to clog up like another brand of 5 blade razor cartridge I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, for the price difference I&#x27;d have to say I get just as good of a shave with a Mach 3 or even a Mach 3 disposable. To me it&#x27;s not really worth the money to move up to the Fusion from the Mach 3...and those are too damn expensive as it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the same brand of shaver for over ten years (Gillette Mach 3) since I purchased a whole bunch of cartridges along with it to last me a while. Come year 2013 and I did an about-face after receiving a free Gillette Fusion Proglide razor provided via a program run by Gillette. I&#x27;m very impressed by this new cartridge. It gives me a close, comfortable shave each and every time. It&#x27;s great dry or wet, for face or private parts (just be very careful :-)).</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide razors are a bit pricey but I would recommend them to anyone. They give a great close shave &amp; the blades don&#x27;t get dull as quickly as most razors I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;this</li>
    <li> I love shaving with this new razor. It was provided by a program run by Gillette. I previously shaved with the Gillette Fusion razor, but the pro-glide razor shaves my face like cutting butter. Its amazing, and it is the only razor I use to shave my face! I love the trimmer blade on top, since I have a Go-tee.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are easy to change and remove- just push the button on below your razor attachment and it pops off. The only thing I found out that I had to do is make sure to dry it after use or it seems to wear out faster/rust (common sense).&lt;br /&gt;PS: You get the best shave if you replace your razor after about 5 uses- which gets expensive if you shave very frequently. Only CON I can think of, but for the quality of the shave, Id rather pay a few extra dollars! Everything else is positive about this amazing razor!</li>
    <li> Completely agree with the hair dryer tip. Unless you dry your blade thoroughly after each use, it will rust fairly quickly and will  be more costly to maintain. That aside, which is common to every blade, the FUSION PROGLIDE has pretty awesome quality. Clean shave, no tug-pull sensation, and didn&#x27;t leave my face itchy after the morning routine. Note: I got a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette, so really I&#x27;m only reviewing the blades here.</li>
    <li> I received  my razors for free from Gillette through a program and I could not be happier!  This makes shaving nearly effortless and it is very clean. A must buy!</li>
    <li> First off i recieved this product for free but I have been shaving for a long time and i must say ive never had a better shave. I have sensitive skin and have switched razor brands constantly because i always get massive razor burn when shaving. After trying this razor i got a nice close shave and zero razor burn. I will definately be sticking with this razor.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to share that I thought that this was a great product. I have already purchased it 3 different times. I have also recommended it to all of my friends and family members. My brother in law said that he has already bought these several times as well.</li>
    <li> My wife shaves my head and face about two times a week. We have been looking for a blade that would stand up to the task without having to be replaced multiple times in one night. This system not only lasted with only one cartridge it didn&#x27;t leave me riddled with razor bumps and the normal skin rash that I usually get, we didn&#x27;t realize it was the razors we were using, always thought is was the cream, so we have been switching between them trying to find one that worked. We received the free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette so we thought we&#x27;d give it a try. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I was given Gillette Fusion proglide cartridge refills through a program run by Gillette and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Gillette has always been one of my go to brands for shaving products. This product is so great because I personally have an issue with blades not being sturdy and sharp enough, but these blades are nothing like that at all. They are super sharp, strong, glide perfectly, and last a really long time!! I plan on continuing to purchase these blades and these blades only!!!</li>
    <li> Received this product via a program run by Gillette and I must say it delivers a great clean shave with no nicks or cuts.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Proglide Fusion cartridges from a program run by Gillette.  This razor gave me a very close shave and let my skin smooth and without any razor bumps or rash.  I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I really hate to shave.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide was the perfect choice for me.  The razor glides to the form&lt;br /&gt;of my face and the thinner blades give a very close and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable handle and very easy to rinse and store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor as a good value</li>
    <li> Loved the Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades. Was a really good close shave.  I received a free razor that was provided from a program run by Gillette. I will definitely purchase more cartridges in the future.</li>
    <li> I love the Gillette Fusion Proglide Cartridges. I got one for free, tried it, and love it. They are really easy to clip onto the handle and they are sharp and smooth. They leave my face feeling smooth even if it is several days worth of growth. I don&#x27;t even have to use after shave. I love these.</li>
    <li> I was given this to try it and write a review from a program through Gillette. I usually use an electric razor, so this was a change of pace for me. Nothing beats this blade for a close shave. It does it extremely well. I wanted to really put the blade to the test and see if it works as advertised. One of the best things since sliced bread is the addition of a trimmer blade on the back side, that works wonderfully. The only down sides to the blade are that they are costly and are only good for 4 or 5 shaves before they start getting dull.</li>
    <li> I was able to try these cool Gillette Fusion Proglide blades for free through a program put on by Gillette. My girl like my face to be clean shaven but I can have stubble hours after I shave. So I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products trying to get a close clean shave without the irritation. In the past I&#x27;ve used the Mach 3 and I didn&#x27;t think it was anything special. Gillette really has improved the way they design their razors. I love that this one has 5 blades because I can usually get a close shave without have to go over and over the same area of my face. The moisture strip lasts a lot longer than my hydro 5 and doesn&#x27;t get all gross like that one. My only criticisms are that these blades dull pretty quickly and they are pretty pricey to replace. I do really enjoy the smoothness I feel after using them....so I guess I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for them to go on sale.</li>
    <li> Blades are awesome. Close shave. Convient to purchase.  Whether you use Proglide or Gillettes other product Fusion you can&#x27;t go wrong with either of these. I feel provide gives me more control of my razor, no vibrating needed.  Other brands don&#x27;t have anything on Gilette, 110% the best razor on the market.  My son and wife both use as well and love it.  We are def.ly a Gillette house.  Thanks to Gillette And their offer to allow us to try their product. You have us as consumers for life.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Cartridge was provided by a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try these blades since I had use many in the past that left me disappointed. Either the blade dulled too quickly, the shave left me with painful razor burn or I experienced just a painful shave thanks to the razor.&lt;br /&gt;The Gilette Fusion Proglide cartridge was a nice surprise. The shave was close, smooth and seemed as if the shave time was reduced. I experienced no razor burn, no pain and have been using the same blade for 3 weeks. I am happy to report that the blade is still sharp and I am still using it. Another key point is that the razor has not rusted like others have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very happy with the results and this is definitely my favorite blade to use.&lt;br /&gt;In addition there is a trimmer blade on the back of the razor head. This is a great idea by Gilette and works wonderfully. Great for a quick, dry cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this razor 4 stars is due to the cost. These blades do cost a lot more than others so even though they work really well, it is hard to shell out that kind of money for blades.</li>
    <li> I use the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor every other day, and I get a smooth, close shave every time, with no burn! My face feels baby soft with no stubble left afterwards.</li>
    <li> I used this razor that I got to try out and base my opinion on it....What an amazing razor it stayed sharp the entire time I shaved never going dull...cut my facial hair perfect leaving nothing behind my face was so smooth and silky...I love how it made my face feel after shaving..I completely recommend this razor to anyone...</li>
    <li> They have been my razor of choice since coming to market. I have been using gillette razors for years. I always get a close shave, and i love the trim blade on the back! My only issue is that I wish they lasted longer for the price</li>
    <li> I received a free razor, compliments of a program being run by Gillette. I gotta say, every time a new razor comes out, I think, \\&quot;Yeah, you promise it&#x27;s SO much better than your last razor, but is it, really?\\&quot; Gillette comes back with a resounding, \\&quot;Yes.\\&quot; This razor makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting a cleaner and smoother shave. My girlfriend says it definitely feels better, and shaving is really something for her, more so than for me. So if she likes it, I definitely like it.</li>
    <li> I am normally someone who shaves with an electric razor since I don&#x27;t have an abundance of facial hair however when Gillette allowed me to try this razor at no cost i thought i would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my personal experience I don&#x27;t often wet shave since to me it is more tedious and sometimes more painful than a quick run over with an electric razor. The occasional wet shave for me is good enough when i want to look my best but Gillete might have me shaving with them more often. Even with minor facial hair there is obviously still tug and pull from wet shaving or an electric razor, but not from these blades. Absolutely no tug or pull it just slid right across my face. Even after using the proglide for a month the blades seem to be as sharp as the day they arrived. Had absolutely no problems with razor burn or bumps, and i thought this was the closest shave I have ever gotten. Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor Free via a Gillette program and I was surprised how well the razor performed. The razor gives a nice shave and it does not leave any irritation on my skin. I have never tried anything that Gillette has made but this product convinced me that Gillette does make high quality products. I will buy some more Cartridges for this razor.</li>
    <li> I recently had the chance to try Gillette Fusion ProGlide through a free razor which was provided via a program run by Gillette.  I have a very sensitive neck area that makes shaving difficult at the best of times.  I usually shave every other day to save my skin, so every other day I look clean shaven.  I was very pleasantly surprised at how smoothly these blades went across my face.  With or against the grain this razor gave me a very smooth shave that lasted a couple days solving my other problem with sensitivity. The cartridge has lasted much longer then my old razor and I think this is is well worth the price.  The only negative opinion I have about Gillette Fusion ProGlide is trying to shave under the nose.  It cant really get next to the nose.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide razor through a program by Gillette. The multiple blades gave me the closest smoothest shave I have ever had. Prior to trying this, I had mostly used my electric shaver on my face every day. Occasionally I would use a razor, but no particular brand, usually whatever my fianc&amp;eacute; found on sale and kept around the house for me. My fianc&amp;eacute; was also impressed at how smoothe my face was. She does not like one bit of stubble on my face,  it scratches her if I get close to her. She now says this is the only razor she will ever buy again for me!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have to say that I did get this free through a promotion through Gillete. I really like this product. I&#x27;ve always been a strong Gilette fan, however I am not crazy about the price of this product. If you have the money then yes, go for it, but when I have to spend 25-30+ for refills....Almost makes me want to switch back to the good old fashioned BIC Disposables</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Would recommend to anybody looking for a nice close shave. I enjoy the ability to subscribe and have Amazon deliver it on a schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product lasts about 2 weeks for me before I have to switch to a new one.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t last as long as the ones they sell at the store. I don&#x27;t know why. Order these twice and YUP......they&#x27;re slightly cheaper</li>
    <li> my head and face have never been smoother!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor!  It left my face feeling baby soft!  The extra cartridges that I ordered with it will come in handy, saving me a trip to the store for more for quite some time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This order was shipped promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought these blades from both Amazon and local wholesale club. Never satisfied with quality of the blades from Amazon. Start getting cuts and bruises from first shave let alone that the shave is no where close as it should be with these supposedly best blades available in the market. The blade barely lasts for 2 or 3 shaves. [[ASIN:B003983HZK Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Cartridge, 8-count Package]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered from Amazon several times, recall only once the product was good. Finally this time I returned unopened packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonder what kind of merchandise is flowing through Amazon&#x27;s website!</li>
    <li> The pack of blades are not consistent, some blades are sharp, while others seem to pull. Over all there OK, but, very $$$.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide razors are a bit pricey but I would recommend them to anyone. They give a great close shave &amp; the blades don&#x27;t get dull as quickly as most razors I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a good shave, wash skin before shaving, then hold a HOT towel to the hair/skin area you&#x27;re about to shave. That will soften the hair and open the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend Kiehl&#x27;s brand \\&quot;Blue Eagle\\&quot; or \\&quot;White Eagle\\&quot; shaving cream. It&#x27;s about $20 a jar but it&#x27;s by far the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s so thick you can even reshave each area many times without getting razor burn or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using cold water on the area after shaving will close the pores more quickly and help avoid razor bumps and dirty pores, etc...</li>
    <li> These blades work great.  I had the Gillette Mach 3 previously, and thought the extra blades for the Fusion were just a marketing gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an odd patch of facial hair that grows in all directions, and so often resulted in razor burn.  The Fusion proglide does a fantastic job on that area and now I only get razor burn when I am careless or in a rush. The extra blades really do provide a cleaner shave.</li>
    <li> But these last just a bit shorter time frame but I&#x27;ve yet to nick myself which more than makes up for it in my opinion!</li>
    <li> these cost a small fortune in the store,  but thay last forever and when you get such a decent price on them,  it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor specifically since I saw the commercial saying that it was also a beard trimmer.  So....just being honest here....it is great for shaving your legs and maintaining your....well....lady parts.  You flip the razor over and it keeps things trim and neat without getting super close or needing to get out the electric....or get waxed.  I only wish they lasted longer.  I have a subscription for these razors and love them.  :)</li>
    <li> My husband, my son, and I all use these blades.  They are great on sensitive skin and give a smooth close shave.</li>
    <li> These blades provide the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I can simply rinse them off when done and tap them on a towel to get the moisture out and they&#x27;ll last for two weeks when I shave every other day. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Extra fine thin blades, getting close cuts leaving a smooth face to touch every time I shave. Great blades, but its expensive!</li>
    <li> These blades are expensive but they are the bomb. Closest shave I have ever gotten.</li>
    <li> Of course these are for the husband and the price for these are great a pack of 8 can be pretty costly but it is more reasonable to buy with the subscription.</li>
    <li> These are refills to a very good razor. 5 blades, irritation free shaving, and no rust.</li>
    <li> What can I say, they are razor blades.  They fit my Fusion razor, and it was a good price from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Gives me a clean smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Meh, the price of these and every other vendor is outrageous. Glad they last a long time.</li>
    <li> Is it me or are these blades not as sharp as I remembered them.  Every time a new design comes out the older models seem to drop in performance. These racers have trouble cutting gray hairs.</li>
    <li> Good price. Great shave. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used a different blade for a very long time, and probably won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Wow... A new pack of these makes my mornings pleasant​.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband. The blades were a good price and my husband is very happy with them.</li>
    <li> perfect for the application it was purchased for.</li>
    <li> This product is the best and only what I use.  The price is the best and better yet, it was fast with the order and deliver to me at home.</li>
    <li> I was given a Fusion by my son a Christmas gift stocking stuffer.  I feel in love with the shave.  This blade set was very reasonable and I m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> my skin is very sensitive and the Gillette Fusion Pro glide cartridge make the deference.  Really I will love It  for long time.</li>
    <li> These shavers are so good that I can use them with Dudu Osun Black Soap (or any other ordinary bar of soap - I just like rich soaps full of natural ingredients), instead of shaving cream. I use this soap instead of shampoo as well, so I save a ton of time and effort. One product takes care of everything. Keeps the bathroom cleaner too, and no rusting can has to be kept lying around to make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ordinary shaver couldn&#x27;t do that. I also use the shavers occasionally with shaving cream for a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, do not expect this to be the perfect super-shave. I still find that new cartridges work better than old ones. I keep my cartridges too long, because while the new ones work better, they also are much sharper and tend to leave an occasional nick. The old ones (perhaps a month or about 15 shaves) don&#x27;t shave as close and are more likely to rough up the skin. The cartidges are also pretty pricey at about $3-$4 apiece.</li>
    <li> This razor is a great product.  Very low irritation and a clean shave.  What I find unusual is that the 6-pack of these blades is priced at $3.50 per blade.  If you buy the 8-pack, the cost is $3.62 per blade.  Not a big difference, but don&#x27;t you usually get a price break when you buy more?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good refill pack. Close shave. Really expensive. As a college student, if I continue buying this, I&#x27;ll break myself.</li>
    <li> Too bad they work exactly as they should...ladies like a little stubble.</li>
    <li> This works great...&lt;br /&gt;Pros.&lt;br /&gt;I shave once a week, maybe,  this handled my scruff with little trouble.&lt;br /&gt;I had to make SIGNIFICANTLY less funny faces to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I found the vibration feature a nice touch that I felt helped in closeness of shave and less swipes of same area.&lt;br /&gt;Cons.&lt;br /&gt;With how little I shave and how thin the space between the razor is, I had a little trouble getting the hair out. That&#x27;s on me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all I would greatly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Fusion user for a number of years now and I&#x27;ve always been impressed with the quality of the shave (and also the lack of cuts that cheaper blades inflict on my sensitive skin).  A few months ago, I decided to save some money by switching to another brand (the Shick Hydro 5).  I made it through exactly one blade before realizing I made a mistake - even day-old stubble couldn&#x27;t be removed without immense effort, and it cut up my skin in a way not much different than if I had dragged a knife all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to be cheap, but it cost me my sanity.  I immediately switched back to the Fusion Proglide, and just shaved a nearly full beard in just a few minutes, with most of the hair coming off in a single pass.  So yes, they&#x27;re really expensive, but they&#x27;re expensive for a reason - they actually work.</li>
    <li> very good i thought it would not shave as clean as i thought i love it</li>
    <li> Best razor blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my boyfriend and I use this razor because the blades are so sharp and you don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot many times.</li>
    <li> As a 30 something male I have come to accept that I am a creature of habit when it comes to things such as my choice of razor, but these really do the trick. I have thick facial hair but still get 3 - 4 good shaves per bladed. This is actually superior to what I have been able to get from competing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a recent price increase (approx. 1 mo. prior to the date of this review), but this remains a decent value overall.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sensitive skin especially used with Gillette edge Extra Moisturizing shaving cream.</li>
    <li> The only razors my son will use.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t tug or snag on the face. It&#x27;s a smooth &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; along the face with a fairly close shave. It&#x27;s super hard to shape a goatee or a mustache with the 5 blades, so i can totally appreciate the single blade at the top for shaping.  The only problem is that it loses it&#x27;s sharpness faster than the 5 blades.  So you have to retrace it carefully with the 5 blades for a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couple this product with Anthony Logistics shave cream for a solid shave.  It&#x27;s probably the best pairing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Really smooth cut, can&#x27;t ask for anything better.  Just as the product has describe, very good product, a good buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried literally dozens of razors. Not a single one is nearly as close or comfortable as the top-model Gillette at the time. I&#x27;ve tried all 3 razors from Dollar Shave Club, and none of them can leave me without horrible razor burn, not to mention, I have thick, scratchy stubble within the same day. The same with Schick, various electric razors, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette leaves me clean-shaven, and not in pain. It is exceedingly rare that I have a problem with razor burn with these blades, and when I do, it&#x27;s usually my own fault, using an old blade, etc. I can literally go 2-3 days without shaving with these blades, with no noticeable stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything else, but these are, by far, the best for me.</li>
    <li> The best razors blades in the market. Sharp cut and no irritantion on the face. Great product and fare price</li>
    <li> Fast ship &amp; awesome product</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this blade is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. They are expensive but they really last. And if your skin is picky like mine, you&#x27;ll be happy with this product!</li>
    <li> quick shipping, great item!!!</li>
    <li> Sharpest, most effective blades ever</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the blades for a couple months and they make me really itchy. I don&#x27;t think this is the real product. When I had Gillette fusion blades they never irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> Blades are great. The process of signing up for this deal is confusing though. Otherwise I would have given a 5.</li>
    <li> Can Gillette get any more blades on their heads?  First there was one, which work just fine, but then someone in management probably said \\&quot;Hey, what can we do to one up the competition?  I know, add more blades!\\&quot;  They all dull at the same rate so one would probably work just as well... but the awesome MANLEY feeling I get from placing 5 razors against my face without cutting myself gives me that boost of confidence I need in the morning!</li>
    <li> these are simply the best razors money can buy and that the Amazon price you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> Blades are sharp and last a long time! Also works perfectly with my existing Gillette handle. Only a few nicks (and because of my own shaky hand)!</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending oodles of money on razor blades for my wife at the big box stores so, I found these on Amazon and decided to buy them instead.  My wife hasn&#x27;t complained once about their service.</li>
    <li> Pay more impulsively at the store or get hooked on the subscription buy, you&#x27;re choice.  I prefer this version since I need to shave every day and have facial hair that destroys electric shavers.  Just don&#x27;t clog the razor with hair and these multi-blades will last.</li>
    <li> Good but very expensive.</li>
    <li> Literally amazing for anything you could use a razor for. My body is smooth and I can surf without bumps and everything!</li>
    <li> I recently received a new proglide razor from a program run by Gillette. The new handle is awesome. It feels almost natural in your hand. The handle is not too big or small. When wet it doesnt slip out of your hand. It helps make shaving easier.</li>
    <li> When I first heard the ProGlide was coming out, I was a bit skeptical on how it could be that much better than the regular Fusion. As is turned out, the ProGlide is better and noticeably so. There is definitely much less resistance when sliding this across my face. It also seems like I&#x27;m been getting a closer shave. The best part of the ProGlide is that your can use your old Fusion handles to attach the blades onto. No need to buy special ProGlide handles. The only bad part that I have noticed so far is that the ProGlide seems to wear down much faster than the old Fusion. I have to replace the ProGlide blades about a week earlier than I used to with the old Fusion. razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> This new blade is the bomb! I was skeptical at first because I have always used a different brand and I thought for sure this blade wouldn&#x27;t work but to my surprise it did! My face was left unirritated and the blade lasts forever! I will buy in the future and as far as budget goes this is a good price for a good product.</li>
    <li> I have used many razors in my time and this is the one is by far the best. It gives the closest, most comfortable shave. I am very prone to developing razor burn, however this one never gives me any trouble/ It&#x27;s a nice and sleek design, has many great features such as single edging blade - perfect for sideburns!</li>
    <li> Pretty good razor. The handle was a little slippery to me. I got a good close shave with no razor burn or bumps. You would probably need a good shaving cream/gel, too. I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve always heard the battery operated ones were better but these come pretty darn close. Received the razor through a Gillette promotion.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide provided via a program run by Gillette. I found it to provide a very smooth and close shave. It was very easy to use and went beyond my expectations. The blades were very thin and sharp and spaced in a way that provided the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This cartridge was awesome!!!! It was awesome shaving with this cartridge.  It felt really nice when I was shaving! It didn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated after shaving like some other disposable cartridges.  I really enjoyed this experience! This was received through a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I would like to start by first saying I have verry sensitive skin. Up until recently my job required me to shave every morning which became very painfull. This caused me to switch to an electric razor which was never very smooth. But with this new Gillette fusion proglide that I got for free from a Gillette run program I get no pulling or razor burn and my skin is softer and smoother than it has been in years. The cartridges are easy to change and I&#x27;ve been using the same one for weeks with no need to change. They stay lubricated and sharp for a while. I am greatly relieved to be rid of my old electric razor and I have a feeling that this new proglide will be my go to razor for quite some time</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shave that often as the skin on my face is quite sensitive and susceptible to razor burn. After shaving, there were times when my face was bumpy and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I received information about the Gillette Fusion ProGlide, I figured it was worth a go. I am familiar with Gillette products, as some of their older products were the best ones for removing my beard. I was intrigued by the offer of a free razor from Gillette and sent away for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridge contains six blades, but this is a bit misleading. One of the blades sits at the top of the cartridge, allegedly to provide some precision with moustache trimming and edging. Usually when I&#x27;m shaving, I just lop everything on my face off-moustache and all. I did try using the precision trimmer, but I didn&#x27;t think it worked all that well on setting the lines of my moustache or my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Gillete, there are extra lubricants located at the top in a lubrastrip. I can say that there is a difference in how the razor works as the lubrastrip disappears. The cartridge becomes a bit harsher on the face as there is less lubricant available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in the end this product did not completely eliminate my razor burn issues, using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide did minimize the amount of bumps I was dealing with when compared to other products. If anyone has issues with razor burn and you have not tried it yet, I would recommend that you give it a shot.</li>
    <li> As part of a program Gillette is running, I got one of their new razors for free.  I have been shaving with the new razor now for the last few days and have been liking the blade.  The package said that the blades are thinner and have a better lubrication strip and it definitely feels that way.  I always have sensitivity issues when shaving and this didn&#x27;t bother my neck at all.  I will definitely buying more in the near future.</li>
    <li> I received these cartridges through a Gillette test program. I had been away from Gillette for a while so I was eager to test the blades again. They provide a close shave without much effort. My hair is very dark so my face requires multiple passes. First with the grain, then to the side of the grain. Finally against it. The Gillette seemed to always be the smoothest even when comparing the Hyrdo 5 blades.</li>
    <li> What a differance a blade can make. I thought the razor I used for years gave me a close, clean, and comfortable shave. But all that changed after I used the new Gillete Fusion Proglide I have to admit, that the new Proglide is the best razor, I have ever bought since I started shaving over 15 years ago. That is why I will say it again What a differance a blade can make. I received this razor for through a promotion through Gillette - I cannot wait to proudly go into the store and purchase my next one soon!</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge through a Gillette promotional program, and prior to this had used a electric razor. Even with my minimal experience, these blades provided an excellent shave, and for a cleaner look, I have switched to using manual blades.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my electric razor, the shave was much closer to the skin, while not being significantly more time consuming. While eliminating hair, the blades are not abrasive, and I didn&#x27;t cut myself significantly, even on the first attempt. Finally, these blades separate from the razor handle quite easily, and clean easily with water. I have changed my shaving habits and would recommend these blades to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Cartridge&#x27;s for a long time. Gillette sent me one tp test out as part of a program they was running. Best shave I have ever ever gotten so was very happy to get be apart of this program. It is so smooth, quick, and Skin Irritation free. The blades are so sharp they cut the hairs with fewer passes and they stay shape for a very very long time. I never had a blade that has lasted as long as this one does. Even after a few months of using it 2-3 times a month still preforms better then blades I used in the past. I always recommend this blade to anyone I know that shaves or complains about shaving.</li>
    <li> Hello, I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Cartridge razor free by a program ran by Gillette and I was totally blown away.  I have very sensitive skin so I am always looking for a razor that won&#x27;t irritate my skin.  When I received the razor, I was amazed at how will it felt against my face.  I am already letting my friends and family know about this wonderful razor.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor I received from Gillette is amazing! The blades are sharp and comfortable and give me the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years. I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> The thing I really like about the Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades is how it does not irritate my neck when I shave. A lot of other blades I have used caused a lot of razor burn after only a few shaves. Gillette&#x27;s new razor with its thinner blades and lubricating strip keeps my neck smooth and comfortable. I use the precision blade at the top for trimming around my side burns and other places where you just need that straight cut; it&#x27;s like having two razors in one.</li>
    <li> Gillette&#x27;s razors just keep getting better and better. Funny thing is, they&#x27;ve always been good. They somehow manage to make the blades thinner and thinner and the shave gets smoother and more comfortable. I received the Fusion ProGlide for free via a program run by Gillette. While the handle itself is perfectly contoured, the real star of the show are the blades. The package claims that there&#x27;s less tug and pull with the ProGlide and it&#x27;s true. Plus the lubrication strip is great for increasing the comfort. Rinsing the blades is easy as well. Never had any hair buildup problems. The combination of a good shaving gel and the ProGlide made for one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;ve used razors in the past that really irritated my neck. I didn&#x27;t have anything like that with this razor. I also like to use an aftershave lotion to keep things smooth and clear. The precision trimmer worked great on my sideburns. Gave that nice finishing touch. I honestly can&#x27;t find any negatives about the ProGlide. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it does it very well. I will definitely be sticking with this razor. Keep up the good work Gillette!!!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Manual Razor is such a great product. This was my first time using it and it cut so close to my skin that my face was baby butt smooth.</li>
    <li> This past week I have had an exceptional experience with the Gillette ProGlide cartridge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comfort level far exceeds blades that I have used in the past; I don&#x27;t feel the uncomfortable tug that other brands blades give me, just a nice smooth glide across my skin. My skin is very sensitive; I&#x27;m a red head and usually get red bumps and breakout after a shave, especially on the neck area. Not with this blade! Maybe it&#x27;s the perfect blade spacing or it might be due to the enhanced lubrastrip since my other shaving blades don&#x27;t have this added lubricant. Finally a comfortable shave without the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the cartridge makes it perfect for getting all the awkward spots and turns without a problem and the precision trimmer was perfect for tight square sideburns and cleaning up under the nose area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is always room for improvement but overall I&#x27;m very happy with the Gillette ProGlide cartridge that I received through a program run by Gillette. I will definitely purchase replacements when needed. If you&#x27;re curious about this product I do recommend you try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice smooth clean look!</li>
    <li> This razor has the smoothest, cleanest shave I have ever had. I have always had irritation issues with razors, but this thing gives me no irritation and cuts so clean and smooth every time. I will be buying more of these Gillette Fusion Proglide razors. This has been the best razor the market has ever had, no one compares in smooth closeness with little to no irritation. Thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide by a program run by Gillette. I must say I simply love these blades. I&#x27;m use to really cheap disposable razors but after giving these a try I&#x27;m never going back! It&#x27;s so much easier to shave. It leaves my face feeling smooth, especially shaving against the grain. I don&#x27;t even have to use shaving cream with these thin blades. The The moisturizing strip also helps these razors glide on your face for a second pass if you need it and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated. I recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> After receiving a sample of the blade through a program run by Gillette, I have to admit that the razor provided a close, comfortable shave. As someone who doesn&#x27;t shave very often, getting as close as possible on a couple passes is very important. The drag of the razor against my face was also minimal, and helped to deliver what has probably been the best shave I&#x27;ve had in a couple of years.</li>
    <li> I recently participated in a program run by Gillette, in which they sent me a Fusion Proglide Razor, and I was able to test it out. My prior experience with Gillette was very limited, I had never actually had a razor by this brand, but I had always seen advertising and marketing for them. After receiving this item, I used it for about 8 days, when I thought to myself that this was the one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have very sensitive skin so regular razors always irritate my skin. After using this razor one my third day, I felt like I had the strongest skin in the world. Not only could I comfortably shave, but I could also shave against the grain, something I could never do before.  The added moisture and lubricating strip at the top of the razor worked wonders. These lubricants allowed the razor to live up to its name and truly glide on the skin. The five sharp blades work together in order to create the closest safest shave I have ever experienced. The precision edger on the back side of the razor worked like a charm. It allowed for access to those hard to reach areas and allowed for the control of the exact location you wanted to edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this razor, I have seen many pluses, but only one negative, which would not deter me from the purchase of this item in the future. This is the lubristrip. The lubristrip worked great, but after a week of use it was clearly wearing out faster than expected. This razor is meant to last about a month, so  I would have expected it to be less drastic. Although this is not a big deal, because shaving gel easily makes up for it, it is just something to note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this razor is a great razor that I would recommend to 15 out of 10 friends. Personally, I feel that whatever skin type you have, you cannot go wrong with this razor.</li>
    <li> Can get a pretty close shave with this and doesnt cut you like other razor blades do.. So i would say give it a try and see what you think about it.. hope other will like also</li>
    <li> My razor was provided via a program run by Gillette and as soon as I opened it and the first thing I noticed was the blades blades were  very sharp. I shave my head but since the blades were so sharp I didn&#x27;t dare shave my head with it but it did give me a very close nice shave.</li>
    <li> I got this Proglide via a promotion through Gillette, I must say that this blade has given me the closest and smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone thinking of changing from their current blades.</li>
    <li> This cartridge is awesome!!! I love being able to shave daily without razor burn. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love the razor it is much easier than with the old razor much nicer and get&#x27;s it much closer</li>
    <li> Razor left my face smooth and soft! I will be buying this razor again. I have used the same one for months but now i will be using this one. My wife even commented on how soft my face felt.</li>
    <li> The cartridge really is huge with 5 blades in it, but it works great.  It glides so well it didn&#x27;t even feel like I was shaving at first.  It gave me the best feeling shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I received my proglide from Gillette as part of a promotion to give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> I recently had the privilege of trying the Gillette Fusion ProGlide that was provided to me via a program run by Gillette. This razor is great. I am in the military, so keeping a well shaved face is a daily chore for myself. I&#x27;ve always used a three blade cartridge, which I thought was good enough. There was always a little bit of razor burn that would start around a Wednesday, and by Friday I couldn&#x27;t wait for the weekend to let the face and mostly neck heal up a bit. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge offers up FIVE blades that work in unison to provide a smooth shave that is close and leaves your skin feeling great. The best part is the razor burn is virtually gone!!! The cartridge also offers a single precision blade that is great for those hard to shave areas. You know where I&#x27;m talking about...right underneath you nose. Getting your sideburns straight has never been easier. Those were always a guessing game for me, which most of the time lead to a line a lot higher than I wanted. With this single precision blade I shave were I want and no where else. After a good shave a lot of other cartridges get clogged up and are hard to rinse. These cartridges have the five blades spaced out perfectly so that rinsing them is a cinch. Even the precision blade rinses relatively easily. All in all The Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge is a great product!!!</li>
    <li> I enrolled in a Gillette program for a free razor. The Fusion ProGlide provided one of the closet shaves I&#x27;ve ever had with a safety razor.  The razor felt a little heavy, but I could get used to it if I&#x27;m going to get a great shave every time!</li>
    <li> I have received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide through a program run by Gillette.  I really have enjoyed using the razor.  I used a Gillette brand manual razor before but this one seems to work very well.  I have sensitive skin and my first time shaving with it I did not cut myself nor did it leave any irritation.  Usually when I shave with an automatic razor or a manual razor, after I almost always have razor burn.  I grew out a heavy stubble to use this razor.  I shaved with some shaving cream also.  The blades cut very well, very smooth.  I also used the single blade to work around my sideburns and it proved itself.  I really like the way the blades cut.  I will definitely be using this as my manual razor from now on.  It has a clean shave and did not burn my face at all.  I hope to buy more blades in the future for this razor.</li>
    <li> I love how it just glides along the face and neck. It is so smooth you can hardly feel it touching the skin. The thinner blades are a real plus. The lubricating gel keeps the shaver from nicking and cutting the skin. It is lightweight and easy to maneuver around the face and neck. It has a unique easy to handle design</li>
    <li> I just used this product and all i could say is wow. It is a really great shaver. It was really smooth when i streak it down my cheek. Great shaver!</li>
    <li> It is a really great shaver. It was realky smooth when i streak it down my cheek ,I&#x27;ll definitely buy more .Great shaver . fast shipping</li>
    <li> Having previous shaving mishaps I was reluctant to try something new. Looking at the blades prior to using Gillette&#x27;s ProGlide I was worried at how this razor would work. I&#x27;m happy to say there was no pulling at my hair with blade, no cuts and no razor burn. My fianc&amp;eacute; said my skin felt like a babies skin. I&#x27;m loving this product from beginning to end . I have sensitive skin and moles in several spots. Gillette ProGlide razor is amazing.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Progilde manual cartridge was definitely an improvement over my regular Mach 3. There was significantly less tug, albeit still quite a bit of pulling. The biggest difference for me was the closeness of the shave; never before have I experienced a smoother shave. While I didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference during the shaving experience itself, the results of the shave will really be the impetus for future purchases of this cartridge. The blades seem to clog as much as normal blades despite the claims of the packaging. While I do not believe these blades to be perfect, I do attribute them to providing me with the closest shave I have ever experienced.</li>
    <li> I received my free razor via a program by Gillette, and it was the best razor they&#x27;ve made to date! I can&#x27;t complain one bit... The shave was so close and smooth.... drove my girlfriend nuts! I&#x27;ll be using these razors for a long time.</li>
    <li> The blades are little costly but you pay for quality.Gives a clean close shave without nicking.Blades last for quite a few good shaves and well worth the cost</li>
    <li> Expensive as these items are, this new product provides a great shave! Moved away from electric shaver as nothign tried before gives sucha  close shave. HighLy recommend.</li>
    <li> I was offered to try this for free by a program run by Gillette. You can never go wrong with Gillette! It&#x27;s been around for a long time...but Gillette Fusion ProGlide is something different it has changed my shaving experience 360 degrees (to the better) it just does as it says in the title! Glides on your skin smoothly no irritation to the skin or resistance Love this product.</li>
    <li> I have received this product for a program ran by Gillette and I have to say that out of all of the razors that I have tried these work the best.  The Gillete Fusion ProGlide razor is a very dependable razor.  The blades are very good blades that did not cause nicking, did not pull my hair, and made my face smooth.  These razors have lasted me longer than what most razors last me.  I thought for sure that when I got this razor it was going to be just like the rest but I was wrong.  This razor has made me change my current brand to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide.</li>
    <li> I HATE shaving ...  my skin is like a peach ...  and my beard is like angry hay ....  these blades glide over my soft skin and cut through the brutal facial hair ..  less cut&#x27;s .. less nicks ...  all seams right in the world!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette proglide as a promotion from Gillette to use and rate their product.  didn&#x27;t know if this razor would be any different or better than the Razor I use now but after using the same blade for over a week now and still getting a pretty smooth shave I&#x27;m impressed. There is not a lot of drag that you would expect with a multiple blade razor and over all its been a pretty good experience.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. The blades do a good, close shave. I tried this product for free through a program that was run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I receive a free razor from a program run by Gillete and I should say that GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE CARTRIDGE is the best I have used up till now . It provides a very nice and clean shave and overALL shaving experience is now very comfortable. Thankyou Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received one these blades for free from Gillette and I have been using these blades for about 2 weeks now and they are very smooth gliding, they have almost no drag, and they leave my skin super smooth, I felt they were a bit bulky though, and it made it hard to get around my nose well, if you have a mustache this would probably be no problem.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a close shave then this is a perfect blade for you. I was lucky to receive a free razor from Gillette through a program they were running and tried it out. It, like any manual razor, is not for long hairs because obviously it will get stuck in the blades. However, as long as you keep rinsing it and keep it clean, it will give you a great shave for awhile. The blade is smooth across your face and, at least for me, has given me minimal irritation or nicks. I&#x27;ve tried other blades that claim to be as good that shred my face and neck, but this razor definitely doesn&#x27;t. Paired up with a nice shaving gel or cream and after shave, you will not regret buying one of these razors at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a college student and didn&#x27;t shave for a few weeks before finals. When I got home I was excited to shave with these new cartridges, but quickly learned that unless the hair is short, it will cut very small amounts of beard. While it is great for once a day shaving and even once a week shaving, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anything much thicker. It cut great when the hair was shorter though, and I really enjoyed how close the blades got!</li>
    <li> After using my current razor for years, I was skeptical about the Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor when Gillette provided me one to try. After using it for a week, I must say that I am quite satisfied. The new blade definitely gave me a close shave. The lubricating strip gives me the moisturizing effect that I need to feel comfortable as well. I did get nicked a few times during the week, but it wasn&#x27;t anything unusual considering my previous shave experiences. I am definitely considering switching to the Gillette razor in the future now!</li>
    <li> So I used this product and I fell in love with how great this razor works!!! I&#x27;ve never used such a great razor and I have VERY sensitive skin and no shave bumps!!! Suggest this product for someone who has sensitive skin like myself! AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I like this razor a lot. It can get a really close to the skin and make your skin really smooth. The con of this though is that lotion strip does not last long but the blades are sharp and it doesn&#x27;t leave razor bumps on my face. I have really sensitive skin and this really works for me. I got this free razor and it was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Like other Gillete razors I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one did not disappoint. I had a set sent to me as part of a Gillete promotion and I was certainly glad to give these a shot. The blades are sharp and cut smooth. I did not experience any irritation, and even a dry shave cut well without leaving too much itching. The blade&#x27;s precision trimmer is exactly what it is advertised as: a detailing tool for those finishing touches. The only downside I have found is that the blade assembly sometimes pops off if knocked around a bit. I once knocked the blade a few times against the side of my sink to shake off some shaving cream and the blade assembly popped right off. It&#x27;s easy to put back together, but you run the risk of nicking your hand as you push it back into place. Aside from this minor hassle, I have to say this razor cuts up the competition.</li>
    <li> I typically cycle through razor products periodically to see what&#x27;s out there in the market and how well they work for me, but recently received a sample of the Proglide through a Gillette sponsored program so gave it a try again after a bit. The smoothness of the shave was apparent right away. It glides easily along the skin without any pulls or tugs going either with or against the grain. Normally this would worry me into thinking I&#x27;m not getting a close shave and would have to go over areas again and again, but that&#x27;s not the case with the Proglide. A close shave without irritation is really the key to a great razor blade, and that is what the Proglide delivers. The trimmer is also very accurate and easy to position so you don&#x27;t have to fiddle around with getting an even groom for a long time and delivers in an easy go if you take your time and line it up right. Use after use I come away from shaves without nicks or irritations and though they are a bit pricey, you can get a long use out of a single blade so it pays off in that respect. Nothing negative to say about these great cartridges!</li>
    <li> I have used many products from Gillette before and have always had great results, but this one is incredible. The lubricating gel leaves the skin smooth and calm during and after shaving and allows for a very smooth, close shave. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other razor ever again!</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual cartridge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several razors and a few different electric shavers looking for a reasonably close shave without too many cuts or raw skin. Fusion ProGlide is not the answer for me. The best part about the ProGlide is that it never cuts the skin. I&#x27;ve used them almost every day for a couple of weeks without a cut. I don&#x27;t think I can say that about any other razor I&#x27;ve tried. The downside is that I can never get a close shave with these blades.I manly shave my head with manual razors. Being a Black man I feel our hair is a little courser than most. With that being said it took multiple times going over my head to get a good close shave. No matter how many times I try or how many different directions I shave the same area, it still felt a little stubbly. By the end of the day, I feel like I need a shave again. Should we have to shave twice a day? I think I&#x27;ll go back to one of my cheaper razors that gave me a better shave. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor is a good product its just not designed for people with my type of hair.</li>
    <li> I received a free Proglide cartridge and handle from Gillette. I have most recently been using the Schick Hydro. From my experience these models are competing directly against each other. I feel that the extra thin blades of the proglide felt kind of cheap like they might break. I did like the spacing of the blades which allowed the whiskers to be easily flushed out. Compared to the Schick Hydro, it does not leave my skin feeling as smooth and moisturized. My neck would feel the razor rash more with the proglide. I have really sensitive skin though and feel that the proglide wasn&#x27;t as nice to my skin as the Schick. The Schick also has a cool feature where the top folds back a little bit so the blades were all the way at the top, making shaving under my nose a lot easier. I didn&#x27;t notice how nice this feature was until I switched to the proglide and I realized it did not have the same feature. All in all, it&#x27;s a razor, it shaves your skin, it&#x27;s smooth. But if I had to choose between a proglide and a Hydro I&#x27;m definitely going with the Hydro.</li>
    <li> More blades&#x3D;better shave, right? Well I was skeptical that more blades&#x3D;more opportunities to cut myself. I did receive this from a free program from Gillette, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t shave every day, as there&#x27;s been no complaint from the wife, and really sometimes don&#x27;t have time. So when I do get around to it, I&#x27;ve often needed to really make it count, without cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a smooooth operator. Whether it was 1 day or a longer thicket, there were no problems getting close, even in the dimples. (cute, I know!) All around top performer I&#x27;ve had, and way better than an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smooth shave without the ouch really gives it value. I&#x27;m impressed. A little pricey, but as I don&#x27;t shave every day, I&#x27;m going to follow another review&#x27;s advice and dry it out with a blowdryer after use and see if it keeps the razor/glidestrip longer.</li>
    <li> Using the razor is excellent and since it was from a program run by Gillette the razor was free. The blades are the longest lasting replaceable blades I&#x27;ve ever used.  The only negative is the cost of replacement blades but given how long the blades last they off-set each other.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a Gillette program I was able to give this razor a try. I&#x27;m not usually the type to write a review, but after I shaved with this razor a couple of times I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m quite impressed! This is easily the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used! It left my sensitive skin nice and smooth, didnt get any razor burn, the glide was smooth and the rinsing slots did not stay clogged up. Definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive a Fusion Proglide razor from Gillette and really liked it. The five blade system may seem somewhat superfluous, but the result was a close shave with no cuts. I&#x27;ve always had problems getting a close shave around my chin - the blade suspension really helped maneuver the razor around this problem area. The blades were also easy to clean with no hairs clogging up the system, something I have had trouble with from razors past. I have sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t notice the effect of the moisture strip; I feel investing in high quality shaving gel is of greater importance (I trust Gillette products in this area, too).</li>
    <li> After going from blade to blade, I decided to drop the blade completely, and go electric. It wasn&#x27;t the smoothest shave, but it was quick and painless. I was then offered a free package of Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades to try out through a program run by Gillette. I let my beard grow out a little bit and then tried these blades. WOW!! They are great! The multiple blades glide on my face (mind you, as a middle easterner, my hair is extremely coarse), and left my face baby-butt smooth. The clean up was quick, and the single, precision blade on the back works well to get that nice straight line on your sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I won&#x27;t use this to shave my head because it is too slow, using it on my bead was very effective and I can see myself purchasing another pack of these blades in the not too distant future</li>
    <li> Wen i first receive the fusion proglide i try it and it was a big difference even my wife notice the difference right away there was absolutely no hair in my face at all and my skin felt so good this is asome</li>
    <li> Love this razor and the great shave that comes with it. the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette but i would definitely put in the money for this razor. I really liked this over my old electrical razor because i felt that it got a really low cut which left my skin feeling really good. Would highly recommend everyone to try it because it worked miracles for me.</li>
    <li> Got the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual cartridge in the mail thanks to a trial program run by Gillette. The blades gave me the closest and most effortless shave I have had since I first traded up to the Mach 3 when I was 17 from the disposable 2 blade razors by Bic. Areas that are usually too sensitive to get really close were effortless. I didn&#x27;t even have to go back against the grain like I usually have to do. I was very impressed with it. I did not get much use out of the precision blade on the back of the razor, but it was easy to get straight lines with the face of the cartridge. Great shave. This is my new go to blade.</li>
    <li> I like it always use it. Easy to shave and keep my face smoothly. That was my favorite brand to use.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide to try from a trial program that Gillette was offering. I was happy to receive this razor as I have sensitive skin when it comes to shaving. This is by far one of the best razors I have ever used. It gave a very close shave with minimal skin irritation. Other razors from other companies would often burn or cut up my face. Not so though with these Cartridges for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide though. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> The razor is quite nice right out of the box. I normally wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on a razor, so I was excited when I found out I could try it for free. It leaves a nice smooth finish, and the single trimming razor on the back side is perfect for some hard-to-reach places. My only complaint was that it seemed to dull rather quickly, and additional razor heads are expensive. Wish they could find a way to lower the cost, but I guess that&#x27;s how they get you...</li>
    <li> I got to try this razor free care of Gillette so I could review and give my opinion. I like the look and design of this razor. First a handle that has rubber grips in all the main areas where your hand grips the handle. A plus when your a shaver like me who likes a lot of shave gel or foam and water which makes for a slick shave. But with this handle i had no problems keeping a good grip and no annoying slipping causing frustration as i shaved. The blades have good pivoting around the areas that can be hard to get a close shave like the nose, chin and jaw line. It moves effortlessly across the skin with no tugging or pulling even after a few uses it still glides nice. Blade lays nice against the skin moving just right across my bone structure. My wife hates stubble and rough skin which can occur after what you thought was a good shave but with tis shaver she felt the difference and commented righ away. My skin was smooth, soft, stubble free and no irritation to my skin or sensitivity. All in all a great shave with a great shaver. Thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide razors are a bit pricey but I would recommend them to anyone. They give a great close shave &amp; the blades don&#x27;t get dull as quickly as most razors I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a good shave, wash skin before shaving, then hold a HOT towel to the hair/skin area you&#x27;re about to shave. That will soften the hair and open the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend Kiehl&#x27;s brand \\&quot;Blue Eagle\\&quot; or \\&quot;White Eagle\\&quot; shaving cream. It&#x27;s about $20 a jar but it&#x27;s by far the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s so thick you can even reshave each area many times without getting razor burn or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using cold water on the area after shaving will close the pores more quickly and help avoid razor bumps and dirty pores, etc...</li>
    <li> I received the razor to try from a Gillette program. I use it to shave my head. It works really well. Smooth shave no bumps or burns. Glides across head leaving to smooth. Easy to clean and lasted about 7 times of shaving my head until it got dull. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I remember using my dads Vintage Gillette Razor 1920 and yes old school is better...but...when it comes to razor burns, its time to seek a upgrade so I start using Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge along with a proglide of course and yes I did felt the difference much quicker, smooth, and clean...with its lubrication strip that made my shave much less difficult, the idea of five blades what good too...cause you&#x27;ll be doing five shaves in one, I enjoy using new Gillette Fusion Proglide cartridge.  But the best part was that Gillette was kindly enough to send it to me for FREE!!!! and yes its going to be one of my top products.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this Gillette Fusion Proglide cartridge free from Gillette to try and have found it to give the best shave I have ever gotten from a disposable type of blade/cartridge.  I have tried many different styles and types of disposable razors AND electric razors and to me personally, this gives the closes and best shave that I have gotten in my 40 plus years of shaving.  I HIGHLY recommend this system of shaving.</li>
    <li> I received this free razor through a program provided by  Gillette. Before this product I was happy using the Mach 3 cartridges.  After using these fusion proglide cartridges I can honestly say this is the most comfortable and precise shave I ever had.  The proglide blades perform better with less irritation.  I didn&#x27;t feel it pull any of the hair.  I absolutely love that extra precision blade.  Works very well with no skin tear or irritation.  I used it to shape my sideburns and goatee.  Again, no irritation at all even with that single blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was the hair removal from the precision blade.  It was kind of a struggle to take the hair out even when the blade was under rushing water.  I even cut a bit of skin; not enough to bleed just a tiny piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion I love these blades because of the 5-blade smoothness and the precision blade included at the head.</li>
    <li> Overall the blade was o.k. but with my sensitive skin and course beard it doesn&#x27;t work the best. After receiving this cartridge from a promotion Gillette out on I gave it a try. The cartridge is bulky and with its overall size I could not shave in all the angles my beard grows. This caused tugging and overall razor burn. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this razor for the course beard/sensitive skin types.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free of charge from a promotion run by Gillette.  I was not sure what to expect when I received them, but the packaging was nice.  I tried the razor and was impressed by the closeness and comfort of the shave, but it was not much better or worse than other razors with the same number of blades in the same price range.  I would buy it again, but not exclusively.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed by this product from Gillette. After several weeks of regular usage, it has yet to cut me and has continued to produce a smooth, fresh finish. If this is within your price range for a razorhead, I&#x27;d highly recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I received this razor and cartridge free from Gillette, and I had never used this product before that. I had always been a Schick Hydro 5 guy. I have to say that the shave I am able to achieve with this is amazing. Definitely the best razor blade I&#x27;ve ever used, and I think I&#x27;ve officially been converted to a Fusion ProGlide guy.</li>
    <li> So I received my Fusion ProGlide from Gillette. I tried the razor and the first thing that I noticed was the handle. The handle fir my hand like it was designed just for me. The pivoting head and the way the blades are positioned gave me a shave unlike I have ever had before. The one thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the moisturizing strip. Although, it did assist in a smooth shave, it made my face feel a little slimey. Overall, my experience with the Gilette Fusion ProGlide was a positive on and one that I will be continuing for a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is great but is a little pricey.  I was given this product for free from a campaign ran by Gillette.  I&#x27;ve been using this product ever since I&#x27;ve gotten it and I thought it is GREAT.  Close shave, doesn&#x27;t cut me, and I can&#x27;t complain one bit.  Just a great product.</li>
    <li> This razor was given to me for free by a company sponsored by Gillette. The razor did great for me and I really like it. The cartridge seems to do great with just one sweep even if you don&#x27;t shave every day. The refills are a bit pricey but if you take of them they seem to last a long time. I didn&#x27;t have as many nicks/cuts as I normally do.</li>
    <li> When Gillette sent me a free razor to try out and with my history with Gillette I had a feeling it would be something good.  I was not wrong.  My face is sensitive, my hair grows every which way but right, and when done shaving with other razors, I look like Freddy Krueger got to my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, remembering about the time I turned 16, Gillette sent me their brand new product called Mach 3 in 1998.  This reminded me of that time, but with the new Fusion Proglide, you have that extra blade for the trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first use with the Fusion Proglide, there was no blood, my face felt like a supermodels skin, and as my wife put it (extremely smooth).  I usually give my face a trim as I usually wait a few days sometimes before shaving, growing a small beard.  But I used this blade and after 3 weeks so far, it hasn&#x27;t dulled, rusted, and the smoothing strip is still there and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give this product 10 stars I would.  Once again Gillette, for 13 years of a smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom face, thank you!</li>
    <li> I got this free razor which was provided via a program run by Gillette. The blades are amazing. Does as the product say...glides like a pro.. Will be my new razor from now on. It has a very noticeable difference..experience no nicks and a better shaving experience for me.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free via a program ran by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked it. I have sensitive skin, as well as acne which flares after I shave. After using the Proglide, no bumps, sensitive wise or acne wise. I&#x27;m thinking of ordering more blades for it. My only complaint is that the local stores don&#x27;t carry the refills as of yet. Hopefully that will change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a cheap razor, but the money is worth it.</li>
    <li> I received this cartridge from Gillette to try!!I loved it so much I went and bought refills already! The trimming blade takes a little getting used to, Had a couple mishaps of over trimming. lol But I now have the hang of it and will never use any other! Thanks for converting me away from disposables Gillette</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to get to try these blades out for free via a Gillette program and WOW.  i have always been a scruff/beard kinda guy but a recent new job has made me have to keep it mostly clean shaven for work.  i tried a few different blades and this was by far the most comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades glide along the skin very smoothly without the ripping sensation i tend to get from other brands.  Also, there is little to no irritation of my skin no matter what direction i shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am very happy with these blades and will likely continue to use them from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette!!!</li>
    <li> Great Razor! I received this razor in a promotion from Gillette to try out. It gives an incredibly close and smooth shave every time. Blades hold up well after repeated usage. Will definitely stick with this razor for a long time. Had been using the razor with the built in electric trimmer built in, but bought a dedicated trimmer and have been much happier.</li>
    <li> I shave quite frequently and it can be a very arduous task to say the least. So believe me when I say that this is the most effective and efficient blade cartridge on the market. It is easy to install and use. With all of those precision blades I can accurately trim and all out shave with ease. The close shave leaves my skin feeling baby smooth and I don&#x27;t have to shave even half as often. I first thought it was just another razor with some gimmick and high profile commercials, but it exceeded my expectations and easily lived up to all of the hype. I highly recommend this razor cartridge to any many who wants the closest shave possible and a durable blade to outlast even the toughest of beards and mustaches. Just give it a try and you won&#x27;t regret it even for a single instance.</li>
    <li> I received these razors for free via a program run by Gillette. They are very nice, sharp, nimble and good on sensitive skin. The only better razor I have used is the Gillette Power Blades, but I still would recommend these fully.</li>
    <li> I have been more of an electric shaver guy, I&#x27;d always get bumps or cuts from whatever razor was out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However Gillette gave me trial to try this product and I was very skeptical, as there is always some newer better razor it seems every few year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this razor did its job well, most importantly I didn&#x27;t get any cuts from this blade. I usually end up with 3-4 in certain spots from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following days I didn&#x27;t experience the bumps or breakout rash that I usually get from shaving with a razor, that is a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the shave the blades cleaned up real well, most if not all the hair was able to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all I have to give this product all its do, as it has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I got to try a free razor with these blades provided from a program by Gillette. But i will say this will no way bias my review. I like how easy the blades are able to tackle my thick stubs. Other razors cause a lot more tugging or pulling while shaving which made it hurt if i let it grow too long. While there is still tugs and pulls here and there they are significantly less with these blades. The strip on the top which lubricates as you shave works very well with the razor but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all; after 2 shaves the strip is gone which sucks. But that doesn&#x27;t matter as i buy their shaving cream and that works almost just the same. The blades themselves last a bit shorter but i rather have that then a painful shaving which doesn&#x27;t happen with these blades. Overall I love these blades and I bought the electric one that vibrates and will continue using this razor until something else comes out that is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* Less pull and tug when shaving longer hair&lt;br /&gt;* Awesome lubricate (see below for the bad side of that)&lt;br /&gt;* Less Razor burn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* Lubricate doesn&#x27;t last long&lt;br /&gt;* Razors last a bit shorter (compared to what I was using before)</li>
    <li> I have seen some of the reviews comparing it to the Fusion, I haven&#x27;t used either product until I got a sample from a program from Gillette.  I have used the Fusion ProGlide now for two weeks (same razor) and it still is smooth without leaving gaps.  That is longer than usual on my Italian heritage face.  Disposables usually last 2 days and I was using the Mach3, since I get less stubble stuck in the blade which usually has me going about a week before I start thinking about a new blade and needing one by week 2.  I hadn&#x27;t realized how long it had been until I was reminded to put in my review, I was waiting to trash it, due to the hype (why use 3 blade, we have 4 no now 5) but it really works.  I really haven&#x27;t found a razor (other than some super cheep or disposables) that don&#x27;t start out giving a good shave, that is the point of all of them.  But to keep the quality for over two weeks, without a blade change is new to me.  I checked out the price, and the refills are pricey, but looks like I be saving money overall compared to the Mach3.</li>
    <li> I received the new Fusion razor from a promotional program from Gillette. I was initially put off by the price of the blades until I tried the Fusion manual razor.  I was pleasantly surprised at the closeness of the shave and how smooth my skin felt.  Over the last two weeks I do not have any  razor marks, bumps or irritation.  The blades last much longer than I expected.  I would recommend these improved Fusion cartridges.</li>
    <li> this is the best razor ever I have sensitive skin and this is the only razor I have found to me a smooth shave with out irritation I love this razor</li>
    <li> Im a big Gillette fan anyways but the new Gillette Fusion is great.. It seems smoother than the old blades... I would definitely recommend them...</li>
    <li> I have never liked shaving very much. I always got razor bumps and it itched when it grew back in. This razor was so smooth. Easy to use, and really minimized the itching. Also no tug or pull when shaving. Its great.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Cartridge is an excellent blade.  The blade provides a very close shave that allows me to shave less often and not worrying about a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  The only down side is that they are on the pricey side but I am able to use them for about a week or 2 before having to replace the cartridge so that helps off set the cost.  I was given handle with a cartridge free of charge.</li>
    <li> This is my first time reviewing a product here but I had to review these blades.It hardly felt like shaving with these,the razor seemed to just glide across my face.Fewer strokes and as close a shave as I can get.I was using a schick quatro but now I have found a new razor.The blades also seem to give me 4 or 5 more shaves per cartridge.</li>
    <li> The razor it self looks very impressive. Once i tried the razor, i stuck with it. It will leave your cheeks and neck pretty smooth.</li>
    <li> last week i got a free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette&lt;br /&gt;i felt a reasonable good stuff highly recommeded&lt;br /&gt;i never its superb but recommedabile product</li>
    <li> This cartridge lasts a long time and gives a great shave with every use. I like that it has 5 Blades, leaves skin smooth and doesn&#x27;t give razor burn. I tried this product thanks to a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide it will give you the closest shave with no irritation. If your looking to make the razors last longer you want to keep them dry, when they stay wet rust will form and then the blade is no good. The reason I did not give 5 stars is they are a little pricey.</li>
    <li> This is THE razor system to have! Perfect weight distribution makes smooth swoops while effectively cutting all hairs in its path. I purchased the cartridges &amp;r the razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. They have a loyal fan from this point!</li>
    <li> These are some pretty sweet blades. I&#x27;ve used some razors before, but they were just \\&quot;straight razors.\\&quot; These blades offer a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super happy Gillette gave me these in a recent promotion. Best shave you can get for free. I&#x27;m going to pick some more cartridges up while I can! The Proglide is WAAAAYYYY better than the Fusion!</li>
    <li> Overall, if you have another cartidge-based shaver, they&#x27;re effectively the same.  Using a shave cream (Rather than aerosol gel) seems to get clumped up between the blades (Again, like any other multi-blade shaver) but rinses out easily enough under a heavy flow of water.  The comfort strip does seem to degrade faster than others, however.</li>
    <li> I was given a free razor by gillette, but honestly they didn&#x27;t need to give me a free one they have some of the best products around. The proglide blades are some of the best blades I have used. I&#x27;m on the road constantly and have used all sorts of blades and shavers and nothing comes close to proglide. They give me the closest and smoothest shave without breaking me out. The price is high, but for the quality of shave i think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample (1 cartridge) of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Blades through a Gillette Promotion. I have previously bought these blades, and there is much to like about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The blades are absolutely fabulous at shaving my neckline and my head (bald), without any tug and pull, and little irritation, leaving my head and neck absolutely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I find the cartridge to be a little bulky when trying to precisely line out my beard area as thinly as I would like, and prefer the smaller Mach3 cartridges for the precision I require. In addition, the 5 blades are so closely spaced that if I shave when my hair (facial or head) is a little thicker, the blades can become clogged after one stroke. Not a huge deal, just takes a little longer to shave when having to rinse it off after each and every stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I rate the Fusion Proglide Cartridges with four stars and would purchase them again. They achieve the closeness I desire, without irritation.</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t use razors due to sensitive skin. I decided to try this razor because it was offered to me through a free program offered by Gillette. The claims of a smoother closer shave are all true. Not sure if it changes my mind 100% on shaving but if and when I do this will be the razor of choice.</li>
    <li> I typically use an electric razor, but this is the best shave I&#x27;ve experienced using a disposable blade. It cuts through a 3-day stubble with ease and leaves the face feeling very smooth. I&#x27;ve used many different blades and there are a lot that do a great job, but the one thing that jumped out at me about this product was how easy it is to rinse. No tapping it on the side of the sink to (hopefully) clear hair/shaving cream out. Just running it under the faucet does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the price. I find it to be a bit costly, which is why only four stars. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide razor free as a promotion.  Tried it and love it.  Smooth, close shave with great blade life.  When blade wore out found the best price for new blades on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Go with a safety razor 10 cents a blade and you get a better shave.  At 3.25 a cartridge its a ripoff just dont do it !!</li>
    <li> The ProGlide razors are fine.  They do the job.  They give a nice close shave and has never given me razor burn.  They will shave my face even when I let it go for a week or two (although, my facial hair is not that thick).  The one blade side or trim blade is nice.  Helps to get under the nose and some other areas.  The price is about where it is everywhere else.  I bought when they were on sale.  You can probably find a better price elsewhere.  I just wish they were cheaper overall.  Thankfully, like I mentioned, I don&#x27;t have to shave much.</li>
    <li> The price on Amazon was much better then my normal pricing.  Good value.  These last for about 2 weeks each, which is much cheaper then the ones that are only good for one shaving.</li>
    <li> theres is no other way to describe this. this blade is supernatural a gift from heaven. this blades are a master piece.&lt;br /&gt;theres is not a reason why you shouldn&#x27;t love this blade.</li>
    <li> These blades last about a month each.With all the blades, I have smoother shaves with less cuts on my already acne covered cheeks. I can feel confident about my skin thanks to the close shave these blades offer. Definitely worth the extra buck or 2.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this razor from a program through Gillette. I liked the razor overall, but it still pulled some of my hair. The extra lotion on it was great though, and was very refreshing and left my face smooth as a baby butt lol. The handle is designed very well sooo comfortable to shave with, plus I could get to those hard to reach places. So overall I give it a 4.</li>
    <li> When I received my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor from Gillette I was a little concerned that I would experience issues with clogging as I had with other 5 blade cartridges that I tried in the past. This was not the case. I found that the Fusion provided a very comfortable and close shave without the clogging issues. I have been using a four blade razor for the past four years, but now plan to switch to the Fusion ProGlide!</li>
    <li> I gotta say I&#x27;ve noticed a nice improvement in my early morning rush with less cuts and less razor burn. I refuse to wake up earlier to accommodate shaving this is a nice excuse to sleep in.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide has sharp blades that cut well without having to apply much pressure. Other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past have been too dull and I&#x27;d either end up cutting my face all up or having to spend three times as long trying as normal trying to shave. I received this razor to try via a program ran by Gillette. I would definitely recommend this razor and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette series of razors and shaving gel for three years now and I wasn&#x27;t sure if the Gillette fusion proglide could be any better then the original. But I tried it and love it! I have to shave every day being in the military and it makes my face nice and smooth! I will definitely be purchasing this product again! I recovered a free razor through a give away by Gillette and I am so thankful to have gotten to try it! I love Gillette!</li>
    <li> I received the gillette fusion proglide razor cartridge for free from a program ran by gillette. I have a very thick beard and sensitive skin. Not the greatest combination when shaving. I used the proglide razor and It was amazing. I had a nice clean shave, didn&#x27;t break out with a rash and only had a few normal nicks.  I recommend this razor to everyone!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor gives a close comfortable shave.  If you use gel or only water, this razor gives a smooth shave that doesn&#x27;t leave a burn.  The five blade system provided a closer shave than the lesser blade cartridges that I have used in the past and is more durable which causes it to last longer.  I am glad that I was able to participate in using this product as I did get it for free through a program run by Gillette.  Thanks Gillette for the BEST SHAVE EVER!</li>
    <li> The best blade right now and does the job right. Costly but worth it if you want to have a smooth face. I have use them and i have liked them very much and would highly recommend them to anything who wants the best shave.</li>
    <li> I can simply say that there is no other need to have any other razor. I enjoy the feel of how smooth it is, it doesn&#x27;t tug on Hair at all, and gets really close. My blades last me a lot longer than past blades I have used. For example the Mach 3. They have gotten even more afforadable with their disposable razors as well. Gillette thank you so much for all you have done to keep the blades safer, easier and faster to shave with, and how they last much longer. Happy to buy these blades every other Month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I loved my fusion razor so I thought I would give the pro glide a try I liked it I had a great smooth clean shave but the blades wear out quickly and the replacements are to expensive so I am going back to my regular brand</li>
    <li> This is the best razor blade I have ever used I am 56  and have used a lot of different cartridges  and there are the best .</li>
    <li> I love how close the blades cut, I don&#x27;t have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and my wife loves that I don&#x27;t have any stubbles. I&#x27;ve recommended this to many coworkers at the station. Appearance is everything and Gillette is helping me keep it up.</li>
    <li> I received the blades from a program run by Gillette. It is a very nice clean shave, except if you have thick facial hair, then it gets clogged and cleaning is a hassle, especially with the spacers in between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One cartridge has lasted me about 5 days so far, and I can tell its time for a new one. Which is costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a smooth shave with less razor burn this is a fantastic product, but if you have a thick beard be warned, it will take quite sometime shaving especially if you have to clean the blades constantly.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide as part of a program run by Gillette. I have heard a lot of hype about this razors ability for less tug and pull. I figured i would put it to the test. My current razor required me to shave more often because if i did not and my hair grew more than 2 days it pulled a lot on my chin and mustache so much that i dreaded shaving altogether it felt as if my hair was just getting ripped from my face due to my thick hair. The first day i received the Proglide I went and shaved it was day 3 and i was already dreading the shave. The very first stroke i could tell the superior quality of the blades. The effortless stoke after stroke just glided on my face. I thought it might just be because of a new blade and figured the worst was about to com on my chin and mustache. To my surprise the tug and pull never happened! The thinner 5 blades made my shave something i didn&#x27;t have to worry about anymore. I decided to let my face go for a week to see if the tug would happen. To my complete surprise i felt as effortless and the first day i had the Proglide. The only thing i didn&#x27;t use on the razor was the single blade on the top. The lubricating strip defiantly help for the effortless stokes on my face. In my opinion this is the finest manual razor on the market.I wont use another razor anymore! I&#x27;m a Gillette Fusion Proglide User for Life or until Gillette Replaces it with a The Next Generation Razor!!</li>
    <li> Received this razor free from Gillette since they were that confident that I would come back to purchase it later.  When I saw the promotional picture had a man with no hair on his chest, I assumed he used the razor to shave not only his face, but his full body as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I followed suit and my God do I feel great!  My face feels like it did before hair grew on it, smooth as can be.  And I shaved my face only after taking care of my chest which now feels like a buttery canyon of delights.  The girl I took home the night after I shaved kept complimenting my skin - something that doesn&#x27;t happen often, so I knew this razor will be worth the purchase once the current blade dulls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star deducted because the product itself looks too much from the future.  I rather the colors be more subdued since it was distracting while shaving.</li>
    <li> This is my review of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor I received for free by a Gillette run program.  I have been shaving with it for a little while now and have come to the conclusion that I could right an honest review of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is SHARP!! I mean very sharp.. It cut my shaving time by at least 20%.  There was no need to go over some spots again and again to get the stubble that my other razor which is three bladed usually left behind.  I have a lot of facial hair that is very thick and this razor went through it like a hot knife through butter.. I used the single blade on the other side only for one spot just right under the nose..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the not so good things about it.. It being so sharp I nicked myself once on the side of my lip. I never nick myself with my other razor which has three blades.. I guess it takes time to get used to five blades or something.. And another thing I really did not notice the lubricating strip.. Maybe because I use shaving gel but I did not notice my face getting lubed up while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have finally come to the end of my review and my final thoughts about the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor.. If you are up in the air about buying it I say go for it. It is a very sharp razor that will cut you shaving time down.. By how much totally depends on the shaver because we all shave differently but it WILL cut your shaving time down.  Just be prepared to use pieces of toilet paper on your face from time to time LOL.. Well I hope you enjoyed reading my review of the razor.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide is one of the Best feeling razors I have used in a long time. Probably EVER I might add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable to use and the blades literally GLIDE over my face. On the 1-5 scale I gave it a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was very happy to get this product from a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received some of these Razors for free from Gillette. They produced a nice shave and I would go out and buy them for this price anytime because I know that the blades will last and that I get an amazingly smooth shave for the money spent. I am extremely satisfied with the product and I think it makes me less self conscious in the end.</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a promotion run by Gillette and when I got it in the mail and tried it, it instantly became my new favorite razor. The blades are so sharp and smooth I got a wonderful close shave that felt and looked great.</li>
    <li> This razor is the smoothest shave I have ever had. There is no irritation afterwards which is a problem I often encounter.</li>
    <li> Obtained a complimentary blade cartridge from gillette and compared with their original blade the proglide provides a much smoother less irritating shave.  I would typically get some razor burn on my neck but with the proglide I noticed that it was less red and bumpy.  I could immediately tell that the proglide blades had a better design and were easier to glide around the chin and other difficult areas.  I have been a gillette fusion user for many years and now will only buy the proglide blades for replacement.</li>
    <li> Gillettes&#x27;s new Fusion ProGlide Blades are ideal for that one pass shave. The Fusion ProGlide Blades give that clean, close, and smooth shave.  I found with other razors I was constantly having to \\&quot;law mow\\&quot; my face which caused irritation and razor burn.  The Fusion ProGlide was free for me to try thanks to a program run by Gillette, and I am happy I was asked to try it out.  I will be using the ProGlide razor for sure.  I have the traditional jaw line beard and the Single Precision Blade is perfect for shaping it.  The competitor has a flip style cartridge for the single precision blade, it didn&#x27;t work so well.  The blades did as Gillette says I had no clogging issues as with other razor brands.  I would definitely recommend picking up one.</li>
    <li> I love Gillette fusion it is a little costly but they gave the best shave I have ever had and they last longer than other blades</li>
    <li> Quite honestly, the GIllette Fusion Proglide felt like just any plain no brand razor that can be purchased at any drug store. The packaging claims that the blades \\&quot;glide effortlessly\\&quot; through hair but it was a slight struggle to do so, even when using with shaving cream. This honestly isn&#x27;t too revolutionary although I will say that it does what it&#x27;s meant to do; eventually get rid of your facial hair.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide via a free trial offered from Gillette. I normally use the Schick Hydro 5 and like it but gave the ProGlide a try. The ProGlide got me just as close of a shave as my Hydro however I felt a bit of a tug while shaving. It didn&#x27;t glide along my face as well as the Hydro. Good razor though. Smooth and no cuts but has just a little pull to it.</li>
    <li> I used Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Cartridge Razor Blade. It was given to me free via a program ran by Gillette. My shave was great, better than what I usually use. I have sensitive skin but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference between what I usually use. It was easy to use I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spot. I noticed that I had a smoother shave. I liked the amount of blades I have thick facial hair and usually have to shave the same spot twice to get a close shave, not using this blade</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Schick guy but after trying the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I am switching for sure. It was very smooth and didn&#x27;t get any razor rash which I get alot around the neck area. I got it from a program for research so it helps that they care how there customers like the product. Easy to switch the cartridge snd I have already bought replacements at a nice price.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Pro Fusion Cartridge free from a program through Gillette and I tested it out for them. I thought it was a very close shave. Also, I have very sensitive skin and this did not cause me any irritation. The thing I did not like about the razor is it was bulky and very heavy to me. This made it hard to get small areas like the mustache area. Overall, the razor was average I think I will stick with my Mach 3 I have been using.</li>
    <li> ﻿I am really amazed by the Gillette Fusion ProGlide blade!! This blade just seemed to glide right&lt;br /&gt;over my skin and not get hung up. Shaving with the Fusion ProGlide blades made my shaving&lt;br /&gt;experience better, I received a closer shave with no cuts or irritation to my skin, and got a&lt;br /&gt;smoother face from these blades. I have sensitive skin and usually get razor bumps and cuts when&lt;br /&gt;shaving but I didn&#x27;t experience any of that with this razor. I like the larger lubrastrip as well&lt;br /&gt;because I can actually feel it working during my shave. I received this razor from Gillette free&lt;br /&gt;from a trial offer and it will be replacing my old shaver!</li>
    <li> When I first heard the ProGlide was coming out, I was a bit skeptical on how it could be that much better than the regular Fusion since all blades seem to be new and improved.I received the some of the Gillette Fusion cartridges through a promotion from Gillette. The Gillette Fusion cartridge helps make shaving smoother and easier.There is definitely much less resistance when sliding this across my face. The only bad part that I have noticed so far is that the ProGlide seems to wear down much faster than the old Fusion blades, but maybe my hair is just stronger. It does seem to be a little on the pricey end for some pieces of steel though, but it is a fine shave no the less.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor for 2 weeks now. I like this blade better then the blade I had last. The thinner blades cut better and it doesn&#x27;t leave my neck irritated. I did receive this from a program run by Gillette but the blade was good enough to make the switch to Fusion ProGlide</li>
    <li> I received a free sample to try the ProGlide last week. I was skeptical about it because I already use the Fusion and just seemed like Gillette was trying to make a new product and market it like crazy. I will say I did notice a difference in the ProGlide from the Fusion. The blades easily slid down my face with almost no resistance. I will be purchasing the additional ProGlide blades when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this one. Smooth shave. Left my face soft and smooth like a babys bottom. Great!!</li>
    <li> I have to say Gillette Fusion did it again!! I love this razor and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to shave every day is a plus, My skin is so soft and I used this blade which I got the system free through Gillette program, yes the blades are a little high and seem to go dull faster but that might be because of the fact your  not shaving  everyday but more hair when you do. I have to say finding the blades on here cheaper in the stores is great so I won&#x27;t have to worry about the price!!</li>
    <li> I got the product for FREE to try out and The blades are thin and placed at the perfect angle for a great close shave. After shaving with it I was very pleased with the shave and I didn&#x27;t have to use after shave to keep from getting razor burn.</li>
    <li> I am one of those lucky few who have sensitive skin, so shaving usually burns my skin. I tried the razor that Gillette provided and expected the usual. I was pleasantly surprised to have a nice shave the first time, but expected the second time would be the deal breaker. It stayed sharp on the second and even all the way through the fifth shave. The only downside was the so called lubricating strip did not help my shave anymore then the shave cream did.</li>
    <li> *Razor was provided free via a program run by Gillette*&lt;br /&gt;The razor is one of the best I have used. I will probably use the ProGlide razor from now on. The shave was smooth, and left very few bumps on my skin, which is somewhat sensitive.</li>
    <li> I am using my wife&#x27;s account to post this review....The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor blade is way better than the Mack 3. It gives me a clean close shave with no stubble. The 5 blade system gives me a close shave. My face is smooth and I use less strokes to shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I actually felt good about leaving my shaver in the drawer to be replaced by a razor but I can honestly say that after been given the opportunity to try this razor free thanks to Gillette by promotion I will never use my shaver again. The shave is comfortable and closer than I can ever get from my shaver and the huge count packages they sell them in is great!</li>
    <li> this is a nice razor very fine shave with the 5 blades,also like the way it pivots.refills are a little pricey compared to two blade razors.</li>
    <li> I just switched from the fusion to the pro glide thee weeks ago and think it&#x27;s an excellent product. Although the improvements aren&#x27;t as noticeable as that from the fusion vs mach 3, I still think it&#x27;s a superior blade. After every shave my face is incredibly smooth and has left me with no razor burn or nicks. It is pricey but if kept clean the blades stay sharp and seem to last longer than others I&#x27;ve tried. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I used to use cheap razors with only one or two blades and they done alright but I&#x27;d have to go over them more than once which always results in razor burn.This razor cartridge is great has five small blades which means gets more hair and causes a smooth shave. I&#x27;ve not once broke out since using this and I honestly don&#x27;t think i&#x27;d ever go back.I was lucky enough to try this for free thanks to a program from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I am considering buying more of these using the subscription after given a free razor that was provided through a program run by Gillette. The razor has thinner and finer blades which left such a super smooth, clean shave. Felt like I didn&#x27;t have my stache! In addition, the handles were easy for me to use on both right and left hands. Good grip control so fewer cut accidents!</li>
    <li> I tried this as part of a free razor offer from Gillette.  I have been using a safety razor prior to trying it.  I don&#x27;t know if I will switch from my safety razor because of the price point, however it does produce a comparable shave.  I would recommend it for anyone who wants to try it.</li>
    <li> I got this razor to try thru a Gillette program for free and I really really like it a lot. I love how thin the blades are I can honestly say it is a far better quality than other ones on the market. It gives superior results am telling ya. It has little to no irritation on most pals that I have who have tried it. It give a clean close shave.</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide free from Gillette to test out and I was really surprised and happy with the results. I got a clean and easy shave. No irritation afterwards when I always get from shaving. Close and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion Proglide razor as part of a Gillette test promotion. I have been using this razor for a couple weeks now and I am very impressed.  I&#x27;m able to get an extremely close shave, but the blade doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  This razor is for anyone with a fear of the dreaded \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot;. You won&#x27;t regret using the Fusion Proglide.</li>
    <li> These Blades are probably the only blades I&#x27;ll ever buy again. With all the others I need to use shaving gel ever time I use them. With Gillet Pro Glide I don&#x27;t need any gel no matter how old the blade is. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m weird for not having to use shave gel or not but it saves me money in the long run and I still get a clean close shave.</li>
    <li> Awesome shave, Awesome product. Skin felt smooth and fresh. No razor burns of rough feeling cheeks. Recommend this products to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE NEW ACTION BLADES AND THE THINNESS, THE GAVE A REAL CLOSE AND CLEAN SHAVE. THE FACT THAT IT WAS A FREE BLADE PROVIDED BY GILLETTE GOT MY ATTENTION AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I USED THE RAZOR THREE TIME BEFORE I FORMED A DECISION ON HOW I LIKED IT. I LIKE IT VERY MUCH, THE HANDLE IS VERY STYLISH AND EASY TO USE, I WILL BE USING THIS RAZOR A LOT MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
    <li> I am 57 years old and have tried just about every manual razor out there, from the cheapies to the high priced ones and I have finally found a manual razor that actually works. Its the Gillette Fusion Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;I have a tough beard that grows in fast and thick, but this razor, takes it right down. It leaves my face smooth with no razor burns or nicks. And the blade cartridge seems like it last forever (actually mine lasted a week). And the best thing is unlike some razors you dont have to sell your first born to buy new cartriges. If I had to rate this razor I would give the Gillette Fusion Proglide, I would give it 5 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love the razors. They provide a very smooth, comfortable shave with no razor burn. They seem to last just as long as other comparable razors..... These were provided via a Gillette promotion. If purchasing myself I would find them a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Tried the proglide shaver and was impressed with the level of comfort and closeness of the shave. Compared to other razors I have used I rank thid one near the very top. Best of all the razor was free provided by a program by Gillette</li>
    <li> I got a shoot to try this product and I am glad that I got a chance to do so. Very sharp blades and always offering the good quality that Gillette offers. I got a demo due a special program offered by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;Before I post this review, I have tested this blades for like almost 2 weeks and this ones are  very impressive, the after shave irritation skin sensation that you always get with other blades is not longer there. I am pretty sure that everybody would like that feeling and not dry skin anymore.&lt;br /&gt;What I like best is that you don&#x27;t have to go over the same are multiple times with twice all the facial hair is gone!!! period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Well I am a big time neat freak with my facial hair, I was one of the lucky ones to be able to try out the pro style glidder from a company via gillette totally complimentary.I am here to report this product is awesome it really does the job with only one product.you can give yourself an edge up and close it off with shaving clean.I would highly recommend you give this a try.</li>
    <li> Blades cartridges are different color scheme from the ones on the pharmacy shelves and considerably duller.  Maybe genuine, maybe gray market?</li>
    <li> Great quality as always, but the price was much better on here so that&#x27;s why I purchased it. Very close shave.</li>
    <li> No surprise here. You are getting a Gillette product. No problems. I really don&#x27;t understand why the blades are so expensive.</li>
    <li> This is not like a smooth slice from a sharp blade.  It really feels like each blade is tearing like ripping a piece of paper.  There is excess tugging which is a problem for me since my skin is a little sensitive.</li>
    <li> Very convenient so that I don&#x27;t have to keep going to the store. And it saves me money in the long run...</li>
    <li> Added comment 12/21: My wife said my skin looks better shaving with the Fusion. Evidently I had some minor irritation using my three blade razor. The fusion is still going strong indicating quality steel blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the comments below from Gillette. They offer excellent advice on cleaning your razor for maximum blade life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought some of you folks might like to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Post: My beard is average. My skin is thin and sensitive, typical for an old guy. Being retired, I must watch my pennies. I am careful with my preparation for shaving and with my razor care when done. Both I find are important and in this introduction, because it deals with how I evaluate things. Here it deals with razors their efficiency and how long they last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t shave with an even slightly dull razor. Comfort is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Fusion was a gift. I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my pros and cons for the Fusion&lt;br /&gt;Pros: (1) It gives a nice shave and the handle has a solid comfortable feel. The metal handle has a much nicer feel as opposed to plastic 3-blade \\&quot;throwaways.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) It gives a nice comfortable shave but I can&#x27;t tell a discernible difference between that and my Wilkinson Sword,  3-blade &#x27;Tech 3&#x27; plastic throwaway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: (1) Cleaning all residue from the blades in very warm water is a critical part in getting the longest life from your blades. The minute separation between the Fusion blades makes it very difficult to thoroughly clean all residue. It takes a sharp eye to even see when it is completely clean. Not clean? Fagetaboutit!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) The high cost, about $4 per blade keeps it from being competitive with good quality throwaways like the Wilkinson Sword at about $1 per blade (The &#x60;BigWally&#x27; Box Store price)  I am on my first Fusion blade after getting more than a month from my latest &#x60;Sword&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I get that much out of the Sword without sacrificing comfort, for three reasons;&lt;br /&gt;first the quality of the SS metal;&lt;br /&gt;second for beard preparation by washing or showering in warm water first, to thoroughly soften my beard;&lt;br /&gt;third the care in cleaning, also in warm water. I don&#x27;t care how good the razor blade metal is, if it remains dirty, the blades will corrode and dull quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) This is a personal preference; the 5 blades present a wide cutting surface. That is OK except when shaving under my nose. It is harder there than with my 3-bladeSword.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:It is a nice razor and if pride of ownership is important, it is like buying a BMW 700, when a fully loaded Ford Crown Vic can serve with almost the same style and comfort but without the ego juice of course. If this is your criteria, ignore my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If comparing cost vs. performance is paramount, pass up the Fusion. I still find the Wilkinson Sword 3-blade throwaway a champion performer for an inexpensive, quality, face-friendly, long lasting razor&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to rate because it depends on the buyer&#x27;s needs and pocketbook. Personally I have to give it a 1.d preparation by washing or showering in warm water first, to thoroughly soften my beard;  third the care in cleaning, also in warm water.

    <li> My fiance and I both use the Gillette Fusion Proglide.  Women&#x27;s razors aren&#x27;t nearly as good as men&#x27;s, so I use this product too.  My fiance likes this razor because he gets a smooth shave without irritation and without having to go over the same area several times to get everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get this product on subscribe and save and it&#x27;s definitely a better price than in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This blade gives the cleanest &amp; smoothest shave I have tried.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Should have bought these in the first place!!!  Bought a &#x27;generic&#x27; version here on Amazon which were horrendous.  But these gillettes give a great shave.</li>
    <li> perfect.  fits on my regular fusion handle.</li>
    <li> Was simply trying to save a trip.  They fit my razor, and work well.  I am now 10 times more handsome too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive skin, and shaving leaves razor bumps. But I&#x27;ve finally found some blades that don&#x27;t destroy my skin! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with these!</li>
    <li> Great deal for the refill package.</li>
    <li> Although still expensive it is cheaper than in store prices. Same great blades at a better price.</li>
    <li> Excelent product ! Thank you</li>
    <li> It tia really good deal also is the original products love it I will recommend this product. Durable too</li>
    <li> Great quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> I recently tried HARRYS.COM, a luxury shaving service, and there is no comparison. Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Proglide really is the best. For me, the difference is not merely noticeable, it is substantial. Just so you can make a good comparison between my situation and your own: I have a light beard, but sensitive skin. I use the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; (vibrating) version of the Proglide razor. I find that this makes a difference, too.</li>
    <li> Great shaving instrument available, arriving promptly and conveniently to your home. This is the best of the scenarios, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
    <li> My husband loves these razors.</li>
    <li> Got these blade about two months ago, perfect quality, great condition and  will be ordering again once I run out.</li>
    <li> Best Razors out there.</li>
    <li> I use these razors daily, and each replacement head lasts about 2 weeks.  I have sensitive skin; this razor is smooth and leaves no irritation behind.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to discover that I&#x27;d have smoother legs if I used razors meant for men instead of buying razors meant for women. For some reason, they just work a hundred times better! As a girl, I&#x27;m very grateful. They are pretty expensive, but all good razor replacements are. I have used these for over 2 years now and I keep reordering! Love this product.</li>
    <li> Great blade, but no blade is worth $4 a pop. That&#x27;s $32 for 1 1/2 - 2 months supply, simply not worth it.</li>
    <li> Great blades that do not last as long as promised particularly for the cost. The shave is easy and the trim element is excellent unlike the cheaper on-line competitive products.</li>
    <li> Best cartridge shave you can get, but for the price I wish the cartridges would last more than a handful of shaves.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but last a good long time if rinsed and dried immediately after every use.</li>
    <li> Good product! the razors are brand new and they work like no other!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking at this you know what to expect. These blades are brand new and provide the Gillette Fusion quality you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I was worried that these would be some sotr of knock off brand or something because of the price. But they are not. They are the real deal and came much faster than expected!!</li>
    <li> good price but they dont seem to last as long as the ones from the store.</li>
    <li> To date, these are my favorite blades ... shaves the cleanest that I&#x27;ve found so far. The subscription has also been convenient. Although, I&#x27;m not certain that it&#x27;s always the best prices that I could get (compared to local store sales), and the price vacillates a bit each time. In the end, the convenience has been worth it. If I was more certain on the pricing, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> best blades out there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are very good blades, have been using them for years now and they work very well.</li>
    <li> Seems crazy that they dull so quickly.  I have taken to alcohol to try and stretch their effectiveness and still continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> This is not the powered one. I use the manual one and have been with Gillette products for decades, moving from single blades up to the multiples. Don&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; blade at all. Blades last typical lifetime.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades you can get. They do make some blades for the vibration model, but I&#x27;ve never seen a difference between these and the vibration models. I&#x27;ll stick with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five blades is probably ridiculous, but it does work. most important to me is the single blade on the back for the tight spaces.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to rip on these massive 5 blade behemoths, have been a guy that swapped over to &amp;#34;Dollar shave club&amp;#34; for their Humble Twin a while back. But in all honestly, this with the ball tech they have gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I still use the Twin occassionally here and there but the Proglide is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 for me.</li>
    <li> These are better than any other blades I have used. These last me about 2 or 3 weeks - give or take..</li>
    <li> This is my favorite razor. It gives a nice close shave without actually nicking or cutting the skin. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> great razor, quick delivery</li>
    <li> like it when i first use it. but it is pricy considering you need to change quite often</li>
    <li> My hubby loves these. They&#x27;re pricey, but he says they&#x27;re worth it b/c they offer such a smooth shave, leaving fewer razor bumps and burn.</li>
    <li> I really liked these razor blades. I received them for free by participating in a program run by Gillette. They get a close shave and leave little irritation. Even my wife likes to use it....</li>
    <li> I used the gillette fusion proglide cartridge for my manual razor.  The blades were free from a program ran by Gillette.  I thought the blades did an okay job but i still did not get a close enough shave and i was left with a little bit of razor burn.</li>
    <li> Having sensitive skin, I usually get horrible razor rash from most shavers I have used, but Gillett&#x27;s Fusion ProGlide shavers are amazing! I tried it out for free threw a program run by Gilllette and I was so amazed how great they were. The entire engineering of the blades gave me a consistent clean and rash free cut all the time. I didn&#x27;t feel that horrible \\&quot;hair pull\\&quot; you feel from dull blades. The added lubricant strip at the tip of the razor cartridge was a big bonus; it gave me a very smooth shave.  Another great feature was the re-designed precision trimmer, its flexibility really helps to get those \\&quot;hard to get\\&quot; spots! Over all, I think this is hands down the greatest product I have tested out there. They are supper durable and gave me the quality shave I was looking for. So thank you Gillette! I can now exterminate those cheap shavers I have so long been a slave to.</li>
    <li> I love this razor it&#x27;s the best traveling razor every... I have Gillette style also...the only thing that gets me with Gillette is the price on cartridge</li>
    <li> recently received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge from a program that was being run by Gillette.  My first use of the razor didn&#x27;t fair to well, but it wasn&#x27;t the proglide&#x27;s fault at all.  I was so use to pushing so hard with my other razor that I accidentally cut myself with the ProGlide.  Each use after it gave me the perfect shave.  I was able to shave alot faster with this razor because I wasn&#x27;t having to go over parts of my face multiple times to get all the hair.  This razor is the best manual razor I have ever used.  I would suggest it to anyone wanting a quick, comfortable, and clean shave.</li>
    <li> One cartridge came with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler and one with the regular Fusion Poglide Manual razor, both of which I received through a program by Gillette. I used this on my chest to finish the job I&#x27;d started with the Styler. I used the manual on my face. It does take some getting used to, and more frequent cleaning - I find that lightly tapping it against the sink after a run through with hot water on the backside helps to clear more gunk out of it)than my old 3 blade (Hey, they were cheap!), but I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results. Thanks to an ex-girlfriend, I find that shaving with hair conditioner works a lot better for me than shaving cream, which probably wouldn&#x27;t work well with this razor. As far as performance, I didn&#x27;t notice any tugging of my skin or irritation post shave. Now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to preview it, I think I will permanently replace my old 3-blade.</li>
    <li> I got these blades from a free program that was run by Gillette. I lathered up and gave it a try. The first thing I noticed was that it gave a very smooth shave. I had about a weeks worth of beard and these blades flew right through it. I even liked the single blade for sculpting when you turn the head around. Great product. It&#x27;s about as good as disposable razors get!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Gillette as I&#x27;ve tried many of their razors before. The only thing that keeps me from purchasing the refills is the fact I prefer to purchase them from a bigger retail store instead of a drugstore, as they are cheaper there, but I always forget to pick them up. So, lately I&#x27;ve been sticking to regular Gillette disposables because I can pick those up anywhere cheap. I received a free sample of the razor via Gillette to try out. This is seriously one of my favorite razors I have tried. The blades make it easy for me to shave and trim my face without causing any irritation. I have super sensitive skin and everything and anything causes my skin to lash out and break out. I have never had this problem with anything from Gillette, other brands I can&#x27;t speak kindly of. This razor didn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my skin, the lubrication on the blades helped with that. Overall my shaving experience with this razor was as smooth as my face. I will try to remember to pick up the refills next time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about you but shaving is a chore to do. What makes it a lot harder for me is that I have sensitive skin, which means that after shaving, I&#x27;m walking around with red irritated skin. Not to mention...ingrown hairs, nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the deal. That is until now...the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge is the answer for all men with sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve gone two weeks with no nicks or cuts. I like the lubrastrip, which helps it to glide across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These new thin blades cut so well that I don&#x27;t have to go over and over the same area of my face to get a close shave. I also can go against the grain of my face without ingrown hairs or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, these blades last. I would usaly have to change a blade sooner because other blades are so dull. So far, though, these blades are as sharp later on as when I shaved with them for the first time. So If your looking for a close shave - even with sensitive skin - these Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridges are the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> When I recieved the Gillette Fusion ProGlide to try out for free from Gillette, I noticed that the razor head looks the same as it has for a few years now, but is advertised as having thinner blades. I was skeptical at first because I figured thinner blades wouldn&#x27;t last as long or cut as well, and I assumed the older thicker blades would have more longevity and usability. Having used Gillette for most of my adult life, I know how long blades usually last, so a comparison to these new blades was easy.&lt;br /&gt;I shave about twice a week at most, so when I do I have quite a bit of growth and it takes a good razor to get it all off easily and without tearing my face up in the process. I gave up on disposables years ago, and have used Gillette almost exclusively since then to great success.&lt;br /&gt;This newest iteration of Gillettes multibladed razor head fits the older Fusion handles, and operates in a similar way. It has the same number of blades and still has the ever handy trimmer blade, and sports the lubrication strip as usual, but it&#x27;s supposed to be a new and improved version.&lt;br /&gt;After using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for a few weeks, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s leaps and bounds better than the older cartridges, but it&#x27;s definitely a smoother shave. I do prefer the newer lubrication strip due to it lasting a little longer as well.&lt;br /&gt;It removes hair easily without irritation or cuts, and the trimmer blade works as it always has, for precision trimming under my nose and on my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t change your life, but it&#x27;s an advancement, and that&#x27;s always welcome when it comes to putting sharp objects near my face!</li>
    <li> First I would like to say I was able to try out the cartridge for free due to Gillette running a certain program. That being said this is a great blade to use. The numerous blades makes it a lot easier to get a close shave. It runs very smoothly across my face and have been getting some of the best shaves I have ever had. My first shave with these cartridges was so good I bragged about it to my boss. I had told her that this was the best shave I have ever had, and she felt my face and approved. So it&#x27;s great for work. The only problem I had myself was the chin area.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided to me via a trial program run by Gillette. And maybe it&#x27;s just my coarse facial hair but these blades made me think I was pulling apart some Velcro as I shaved. However, the blade did its job well, no nicks or cuts despite the 2 weeks of growth. I also like the single blade on the back for areas that require precision. The only downfall to these blades is that the replacement cartridges are a little on the expensive side. Since I only use a blade one time before disposing of it due to an abscess from reusing a disposable when I was younger, this would become expensive quickly.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this product to review, and I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m usually skeptical about the \\&quot;next big thing\\&quot; in disposable razors. I mean, seriously, how many blades is too many? I thought 1 was fine, then I was excited about 2, 3 seemed a little over-the-top, and 4 was pushing it.  My reservations evaporated after the first time I dragged this razor across my face. I have pretty course facial hair, and this thing cut through the hair and gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve had with a razor. There was hardly any resistance, and the blad glided across my face, getting every last hair on the first pass. My face has not been this hairless since before puberty. I know the cost is a bit high, but it&#x27;s worth every cent and you can extend the life of your razors by drying them well after every use. I went from shaving twice to three times a week, to once a week and my skin is still thanking me for it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gilette Fusion razors to shave for years, so when I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor via a program run by Gillette, I was really excited to try the next generation of Gilette Fusion. And it did not disappoint. It is so EASY to shave with because the blade glides so smoothly across my face (I guess that&#x27;s why they named it ProGlide!)I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and the blade has not become dull. These are my blades of choice from now on.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience trying the  Gillette Fusion ProGlide/ cartridge and let me tell you it was a very pleasant one! It has thinner blades making the shave a lot more comfortable on the skin. Each cartridge has 5 blades making the glide through the hair easily and less pulling and tugging. I&#x27;ve used many types of razors/ cartridges from cheap to expensive but this has by far been my favorite! I would definitely buy and recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide to my friends and family. I&#x27;m glad that I was able to try this out for free by a program that was run by Gilette. Thanks GILLETTE!</li>
    <li> Out of all of the razor cartridges I have used - this is by far the best! The cartridges are sharp and give me the closest shaves. I got it free from Gillette to try out and I am glad they did! The cartridges also last a long time so you don&#x27;t have to go out and buy more, which is always great! I will definitely continue to use the Proglide line. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34; Costly, even on Amazon prime. However, if you are going to scrap something across your skin on a regular basis, it is the smoothest and cleanest.</li>
    <li> Who still uses these things? I received a Fusion razor with blades as a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; for my 18th birthday. How Gillette got this information I don&#x27;t know. Does it work? Certainly. But like all cartridge razors it just pulled and yanked hair off. I use razors with one blade now- single edge, injector, and double edge razors now. Blades are $7-22 for 100 pack of blades and the blade cuts not yanks. Much more comfortable shave. Furthermore think about it- you apply the gel/foam lather on your face and only the first blade out of five encounters any protection. The other four blades just encounter your dry lather-less face. Gillette&#x27;s super speed razors were already perfect but the patent for blades run out and they have to come up with a more outrageous &amp;#34;technologically advanced nano quantum space age&amp;#34; gimmick all the time to get more money out of you- hence from the double edge, to the trac ii, to the mach 3, Fusion, Proglide, and now the basketball swivel head. Gillette is easily proctor and gambles most profit margin laden brand. You know razor blades have a 4750% markup? Highway robbery.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide when i received it from the Free Gillette program, but I am actually very pleased with the results. I normally use an electric razor or clippers due to my thick, coarse beard hair &amp; the ease of which I get razor burn after shaving. But this razor did provide a nice, close, comfortable shave with minimal razor burn. This was actually one of the nicer shaving experiences I have had with a non-electric razor. I really liked the way the thinner blades gave such a close, comfortable shave. I would recommend this razor system if you are looking for a razor to provide a close shave with minimal razor burn.</li>
    <li> Perfect delivery and price. These razors are great . Cut better than any razor, and not a single cut on my face since using these.  n top of which less irritation on my face.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give a review for personal use as my wife stole this before I could use it lol.  I got the manual blade free from a program Gillette was doing.  I knew I should&#x27;ve got to the mail box first.  I can say, her legs were amazingly smooth.  She didn&#x27;t have any nicks or bumps after using this blade which she usually does when using her other disposable blades.  I can&#x27;t wait to try one out myself.</li>
    <li> Great product by Gillette. I got this free Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Cartridge via a program run by Gillette. Blades on this razor have very good life on them. Not so expensive product as compared to the fusion proglide power razor cartridge. Just amazing...........</li>
    <li> I have been using Proglide for quite some time now, but recently received a free razor through a program run by Gilette. I love how smooth it shaves and how easy it is to use. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about the product is the price. They can be a bit expensive, but after using them for some time, I have determined they are well worth their money. It makes shaving a lot easier, and more of a task than a chore.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide for awhile now and I must say that I can&#x27;t think of a better razor to use.  My wife loves it for it&#x27;s close shave and my face being smooth. I have an electric razor but it still doesn&#x27;t compare. I would recommend this razor to anyone if they asked.</li>
    <li> for starters i received this item for free via a program through Gillette, and gotta say by far one of the best free items ive ever got, i love thie way these razors work, they give a nice clean shave, leaves skin feeling nice and soft, i have pretty sensitive skin an usually get razr burns or bumps but not with this one, i really like the fact that it has 5 blades plus the precision trimmer on the back. The only complaint i do have is the cartriges themselves are a bit pricey but here on amazon their pretty good.</li>
    <li> Used multiple disposables before and this is above and beyond any of those! Love the small razor on the end and it is very very smooth during the whole shave!</li>
    <li> (review from hubby) I usually like to stick with what I know BUT I decided to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge was made for me. I have really sensitive and this product helps a lot with that. The blades give me a close and long lasting shave. Afterwards I don&#x27;t break out like I do with other brands That Gillette for this great addition to your line.</li>
    <li> I have had issues in the past with different razors, the razors would leave my sensitive skin irritated and breaking out.  I almost gave up on finding the perfect match that would leave my skin smooth and irritation free.  So I tried this razor (was given one free from Gillette) and I was surprised that it left my skin in great condition after shaving.  I would highly recommend this razor for anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> When I recieved this razor free via a gillette program I was skeptical. I have tried many razors to help relieve my sensitive skin issues, andfinally one that works. It doesn&#x27;t have that pull on your hairs, and the moisture strip is really nice. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I got this Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor to try via a program run by Gillette. There are five blades on the cartridge head and a single blade trimmer on the top opposite side. The blades went down smoothly. Not as much pulling and tugging as the cheaper disposable razors. The added lubricant in the strip helped it glide easily, especially over the curves of my jaw and neck. The single blade trimmer is a good little feature to have. The blade cartridge pivots back and forth to give an overall Smooth as a Baby&#x27;s Bottom shave.</li>
    <li> I have tough, course hair that is hard to cut and get a close shave. The first time I used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide, blades, which I received free from BzzAgent, I figured it was not going to do any better than other razors I have used. However, I was surprised. I got a clean, close shave the first time out and even after several shavings, I still got a close shave without all the pulling and tugging most blades cause. I didn&#x27;t even have the razor burn I usually get. The blade cartridge has thinner blades to keep the hair from pulling and tugging as you shave so you get a smooth glide across the face. It has a lubrastrip that is 25 percent larger and with more lubricants than other blades, with a touch of mineral oil. The cartridge will last about a month allowing you to change less often. These blades are expensive but worth it in the long run because of the results you get in a shave. I would recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide blade cartridge to anyone seeking a close shave without the tugging most blades cause.</li>
    <li> got this razor as part of a Gillette promotion.i can honestly say it is the best razor I have ever used.try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I must admit I enjoyed the previous version of the blades better. These seem to pull a bit and the don&#x27;t shave smooth unless you use 3 or 4 strokes. I&#x27;m glad I received mine Free from a program ran by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor free provided via a program run by Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love the blade on this razor! No nicks, cuts or burning during and after shave! Nice, close and clean shave that even my wife commented on how much she loved the feel of my baby smooth face afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Gillette! You now have a new everyday customer for life! Just keep making those blades as great as they are!</li>
    <li> I got this for free from a program run by Gillette. Full disclosure: I&#x27;m a big electric razor fan (I&#x27;ve owned a couple). I like them for the fact you don&#x27;t have to constantly buy and invest in new razor cartridges so it can be cheaper over the long haul. That&#x27;s one downside with this that I had to discuss. I also find electric razors don&#x27;t require shaving cream and other things to use. Almost any time I use a manual blade I always feel like I&#x27;m doing all the work -- and I have to make extra effort not to get knicked or cuts while shaving. I have to say I tried this Gillette Fusion and while I still am not convinced to go manual for the reasons I say above, I definitely could see this as being a great travel razor or situations without power. Gillette even makes a power razor version of this which using a battery will actually cause it the manual razor to vibrate creating almost a fusion between manual and electric.  This is definitely not that hard to use and even comes with a lubrication strip built in. So, while you haven&#x27;t gotten me away from my loyalty my eyes have been opened. I now know what new manual technology has come out and it has shown me its not a bad alternative.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide works the best out of all the razors. I recently received one free from a program by Gillette. Yes I&#x27;ve heard people complain about the price compared to other blades but these blades provide a better shave than others. The new technology in the blades give a closer shave without the worry of being nicked. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s being pulled due to the multiple blades and my shave seems to last longer. The blades themselves also last longer than the cheaper varieties available. I would recommend Gillette Fusion ProGlide to anyone out there for a closer and smoother shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette since I started shaving, through the Gillette Program I was able to try out the Fusion Proglide for the first time.  I&#x27;m one of those guys that grows a not so thick beard so I don&#x27;t really have a problem shaving unless the blades are really dull.  The only problem I do tend to run into is the irritation after shaving since I have really sensitive skin.  I haven&#x27;t encountered any irritation while using the Proglide, so that is a major plus, I don&#x27;t like the red bumps and redness I tend to have.  As for the shaving; it does it&#x27;s job, I get a nice smooth close shave, similar to the other Fusion razors, yet I did find the Proglide gave me a quicker and smoother shave.  The blade was easy to clean up, no clogging between the slots, a quick rinse and you&#x27;re finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a smooth and close shave, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Proglide.  The cartriges are pricey, but you get what you paid for and they are worth it, the razor is durable since I&#x27;ve been using the same blade for a month now and it still shaves like the first day with no irritation on my skin, so you&#x27;d be saving money on buying cartridges (major plus if you can&#x27;t be buying cartridges every week and tend to use the same blade over and over again which can really cause bad irritation).</li>
    <li> I recived this razor free from a program that Gillette did . the blades are great it gives me a great close shave with no iratation.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different cartridges on the market, and am always looking for the best shave, but once Gillette sent these out to me, as a free promotion, I&#x27;ll be sticking with these. They have a nice gel strip, that actually lasts longer than it used to and allows a smooth and comfortable shave. The blades are thinner and seem to even be a little sharper now. The only problem I had with them was that they seemed to dull more quickly than others do. The price is about average to above average for the amount of shaves you get as well. All in all, these are very good blades and give you an excellent close and smooth shave!</li>
    <li> This is a great deal and performance was identical to the in-store product.  Amazon&#x27;s price is 1/2 of in-store price.</li>
    <li> They last a while and are extremely smooth so I&#x27;m going to stick with these blades for a while and the price is great as well.</li>
    <li> I shave my face and head.  Gillette products are the top shelf of shaving products. I tried others like shick but falls short of what I prefer</li>
    <li> These work the best though. Period. No question. So, if you have to spend a bit more so be it. Better than having ingrown hairs from cheap blades. I have found that shaving for me, and I have a medium heavy beard, the best way to shave is to wash my face with a good cleanser, use some shave secret pre shave oil, a little good cream, a face brush</li>
    <li> The replacement blades are very poor compared to the original blades that actually comes with the initial set. The smoothness and sharpness looses after first shave.</li>
    <li> New razors.  Very little in this world has an effect like that.  Having a fresh, smooth, no-nick shave is pretty close to priceless.  I was able to stop using my older, warn down blades and for at least a couple of months I should not need to have toilet paper stuck to my face to stop the bleeding.</li>
    <li> Great for Women! I love this razor and blades, I use to use the Mach turbo and upgraded to this. I love the blades, and how the head rotates from side to side.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the ones purchased in store just cheaper on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Gillette makes the best razor...</li>
    <li> This is like computer printers, cheap unit expensive refills. I like the product but getting a god deal for the blades is difficult. Since we have Prime, this is the best deal I can come up with on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> These are some of the best razors out there. Other razors leave my face feeling like I just shaved with a butter knife. I shave daily and although they are expensive, they&#x27;re well worth the extra money.!</li>
    <li> Thanks  everything expected. Quickly sent and everything was well done. Your an excellent vendor and all should feel good with you!</li>
    <li> Such a deal and love that they come to  my door step and do not have to  go to the store</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like shaving, but then I also don&#x27;t particularly like having a beard and my office requires that I shave, so I shave and that&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors are fine at removing hair from my face, so I am rating them 3 stars.  They&#x27;re fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t seem to be any better at removing hair from my face than the Mach 3 I used to use, or really that much better than the one time use razors I used to buy when I was too poor to buy anything else (I got a 52-pack at Sam&#x27;s for about the same as I paid for this 8-pack of razor cartridges).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is that these aren&#x27;t any better than the cheaper ones.  They still get dull and start ripping hair out of your face rather than cutting it gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wake me up when they invent Nair for men.</li>
    <li> If you want your face as smooth as silk, get  the GILLETE FUSION PROGLIDE</li>
    <li> These are very good.  Get the very close shave very smooth. The razor is so sharp it can be used multiple occasions before needing replacement and I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> these gillette fusion proglide cartridges are authentic...they do an excellent job shaving my head and face! They glide with the greatest of ease!</li>
    <li> Best Razor Blades Ever.</li>
    <li> Best shave every time. No razor burns or cuts!&lt;br /&gt;No need to apply lots of foam&lt;br /&gt;.just a dab of ivory soap or shaving foam and voal&amp;agrave;!  Done and clean face!</li>
    <li> I like the blades, they work well.  Amazon is the best place to buy them; they are priced lower than even Walmart, especially with the coupon you could apply when ordering.</li>
    <li> excellent product and meet what we buy. thanks</li>
    <li> Good bang for your buck</li>
    <li> Arrived fast, package was sealed and new&lt;br /&gt;Blades are awesome, never get cuts&lt;br /&gt;Used these for years, very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> This review is for Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor Blades. Best shave ever. Took me a couple of weeks to get used to the razor and these blades feel great. Had just about decided to grow my beard back again till I found these. Wife is glad I found these. Could be cheaper but guess I could say that about everything.</li>
    <li> Razors, good deal, pay double in chicago for same amount</li>
    <li> Ridiculous priced blades with needless bells and whistles with a lot of other comparable and less expensive alternatives. I thought for a long time that Gillette was the only option out there. Started looking around and the best I have seen are the Dorco. Best value for money hands down.  http://www.amazon.com/Dorco-Shaving-System-Cartridges-Handle/dp/B008O84ZQA/ref&#x3D;pd_bia_nav_t_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0V6TGE7R8AD3KX2JTECS</li>
    <li> Works with the 5-star shaver, very clean cut</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong its a great razor in all but this is a ridiculous price to pay for refills. I would reccomend &amp;#34;harrys razors&amp;#34; becuase they aren&#x27;t trying to gip you. The razor head are only 1.88 per refill and are the same 5 blade quality. If you order the trumen set for 15.00 you get a razor, shaving gel, travel case, and 3 blades.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used these for years and still enjoy the product, just wish they were less expensive&lt;br /&gt;they do seem to last a long time, though</li>
    <li> Best Price for the same name brand product shipped to my door.  Beats Walmart and Those monthly shave clubs!&lt;br /&gt;I will be back</li>
    <li> Reengineered low cutting force razor blades with thinner, finer edges (first four blades vs. Fusion) and our advanced low resistance coating cut effortlessly through hair with less tug and pull than Fusion&lt;br /&gt;Blade stabilizer maintains optimal razor blade spacing for comfort, while allowing the blades to adjust to the contours of a man&#x27;s face&lt;br /&gt;Streamlined Comfort Guard channels excess shave prep to help maintain optimal razor blade contact,stretching the skin for a close, comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;Enhanced Lubrastrip is infused with mineral oil and lubricating polymers, enabling the razor blades to move smoothly over skin, even on repeat strokes&lt;br /&gt;Improved Precision Trimmer includes an enhanced blade, a comb guard to better align long hairs, and rinse-through slots&lt;br /&gt;Just one 12-count blade refill can give you a full year of shaves (based on average days of use per refill)&lt;br /&gt;Redesigned Handle with bigger, more ergonomic grips for better control, and improved transition between front and back shaving surfaces</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad and he liked it. He still said that power version of this was better.</li>
    <li> Great shave. Long lasting. Confirmed user. I have gone throjgh the Gilette razor war for nearly 70 years. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This has and always will be my favorite razor. I have tried several others but nothing can compare. You can&#x27;t go along with this one.</li>
    <li> About a week ago, I started using these blades because I ran out of the 8 pack I bought at Walmart. I thought it was just me when I found my mustache area and neck bleeding after each shave. I made sure to use quality pre-shave oil and shave cream from Pacific Shaving Company - been using them for years. Dab a little Bump Patrol aftershave on my face and neck, clean the razor with a Q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol, store it in my DriBlade case in an effort to make the blade last longer, and go about my day. The next day when I shaved, it felt like the blades were shredding my skin. By the time I finished, my face was on fire. Same bleeding from razor nicks. Didn&#x27;t shave for a day. Next time I shaved the same thing happened despite my meticulous preventative care for my skin and razor to avoid these razor nicks. It makes no sense that this is the same product made by P&amp;G, branded under the Gillette name, and sold at Walmart, Target, and other retailers, yet I have never had such terrible shaves in a one week period. My skin has not changed. My diet has not changed. My shaving oil and cream have not changed. Only thing that changed was where I bought the cartridge blades from...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried another blade today - same razor nicks and irritation all over my neck and upper lip. I&#x27;m tired of trying to convince myself it&#x27;s just me and it&#x27;ll get better....because that&#x27;s not happening. I&#x27;m really frustrated about spending $33 on razor cartridges that tear up my face. I&#x27;m going back to major retailers to get my replacement cartridges and spend $40. Something is fishy with the blades from this seller. I read over 500 reviews of this product from this seller and I&#x27;m not alone here. Seems like a clever counterfeiting scheme to me - seems like this seller may have bought a few hundred legitimate razor cartridges directly from P&amp;G (to seem like a legit reseller), counterfeit thousands in some Korean or Chinese manufacturing warehouse, and then sell the counterfeits on Amazon. P&amp;G would back up the seller on Amazon since he or she regularly buys legit cartridges, but little do we know that they are counterfeits. The packaging and blades looked identical to those I bought at major retailers, but the quality is nowhere near what I have come to expect for the past 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe I just have a crazy imagination and my razor nicks and irritation are caused by other factors...n.

    <li> To tell you the truth ,i have not yet used it but am happy with the cost. I know its a good product.</li>
    <li> I got the Fusion Proglide handle and blade free. I really liked the clean shave it gives. The blade lasts for a quite a few shaves which is a good thing considering the 8 count costs $29. Yikes, that&#x27;s a lot of money for 8 blades. Anyway, I like it better than the last Gillette version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fusion Proglide cartridges for years now. All of sudden, within the last 6-8 months, the razors seem to really become dull very quickly, even with the first shave the razors pull and no matter how hard I try, I no longer get the close shave I use to get. Also, I cut myself all the time. Nothing has changed with my technique. I do not tend to shave very often, but I will trim my facial hair with the Proglide trimmer (which is a very good device, but you need very good batteries so the power will last and will work excellently) and then shave. I use face washes and what not to prepare my face for it, but nothing helps. My father also uses the same cartridges as I do (usually we so the Fusion Proglide Power, but we&#x27;ve tried the original proglide with even worse luck) and he too has noticed that the blade pulls and pulls and cuts like as if someone were trying to murder you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking about trying an electric razor for the first time and its all because of Proglide. Proglide has me not wanting to shave simply because of the pain it is to shave and how many times I have to go over each area of my face to actually get a close shave. The end result is some patchy areas where the shave is closer than other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply disappointed in the fact that somethings changed, i&#x27;m just not sure what.</li>
    <li> I have been buying razors for a long time. As far as saving money, especially for men,dollar shave club! I just wrote a post on my blog last night about it here. [...] and here is a video too! [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves these.  They are kind of expensive in the store so it&#x27;s good to get them cheaper here.</li>
    <li> This product was provided to me via a program run by Gillette. Overall I am not to impressed by the Pro glide not for the price they are charging for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros of this razor are the following:&lt;br /&gt;The strip of lubricant is slightly helpful&lt;br /&gt;The single blade on the end I find helpful to get a close shave under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons of of the razor:&lt;br /&gt;I shave daily and I find it gets clogged with hair a bit to easy.&lt;br /&gt;The price for refills are terribly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;It irritates my face no matter which way I shave.&lt;br /&gt;The shave for me is not as close as I would like.</li>
    <li> This razor works great, especially for sensitive skin.  I would recommend using it with the Gillette Series shaving gel pure and sensitive.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I loved it. It took all the stubble away that other razors couldn&#x27;t. I would recommend this to anyone who has thick and hard hair that is hard to cut. I always used to trim as low as hard as I can in order to shave. Once I do that then I could shave, now I try it and the hair cuts easier. The head tilts, multiple blades, it&#x27;s just a great razor.</li>
    <li> I was offered this razor through a program run by Gillette and I have to say, it offers the best shave of any razor I have used. The five blades glide along my face with virtually no tug or pull and the lubrastrip is noticeable. The only downside I have with this razor cartridge is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a very long life. The lubrastrip is used up in about a week and the blades will wear out a lot faster for someone with thicker stubble. Overall a great razor that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Having very sensitive skin around neck i always hated shaving. Then i received this blade from a program run by Gillette.I figured i had nothing to lose. Gillette Fusion ProGlide is amazing, my skin does&#x27;nt feel like its on fire anymore and i can now get a smooth close shave without the rash and bumps.Thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try the Gilette Fusion Proglide free of charge from Gilette through a promo program. Excellent product... very close, smooth shave,fits comfortably in my hand. I will definitely consider purchasing replacement cartdriges in order to continue using it.</li>
    <li> The Fusion Proglide was provided to me free from Gillette, in order to combat my heartiest of beards and retain order on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll focus solely upon the blades of the Fusion Proglide, and boy, are they thin.  When I first started out with my shave, I quickly realized that my man-sized beard was too much for these blades to handle.  I&#x27;d already shaven off most of the length, but the stubble left behind was much too think and/or long for the thinness of the blades.  Clogging quickly became a problem with each stroke, as the 5 blades weren&#x27;t designed for the sheer quantity of hair they were up against.  I took an electric to my face and razed it all to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A day or so later when fresh hair began to grow in, I gave this product another try.  Wow, was I amazed!  When up against a clean kept face, the Fusion Proglide shows its true colors.  The pivotable head graced along each and every curve, destroying all hair which stood in it&#x27;s path.  The lubricant strip was a very nice touch, as it made the process a delight.  The five blades cut through my stubble with ease and did not present such severe clogging issues as my lengthier scruff did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even notice it at first, but there is a solitary precision blade on top of the head.  My mind was blown!  I started zapping lone hairs left and right before graduating to lines and trim.  Quite a nice feature to add; it did not go unappreciated by this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are excellent for the regular shaver.  If you&#x27;re more of a lumberjack though, you may want to pick-up blades which aren&#x27;t so thinly spaced, and/or a hand axe for better manual shaving.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide via a program run by Gillette. Best thing for sensitive skin! Its thinner blades has no tug or pull on facial hair!It didn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated after shaving like some other disposable cartridges. I really enjoyed this experience!</li>
    <li> I was glad to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor by Gillette program. I found this Razor had far better blades then some of the other ones out on the market today. I like how it was able to get a closer shave due to the closer blades. I did see a little change between Gillette Fusion Manual Razor to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor. The ProGlide on was not as hard on the skin as was the Fusion. Over all it is a very good Razor.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works great and never lets me down.  I have been using these razors since they came out and don&#x27;t plan to quit anytime soon.</li>
    <li> To start off, let me say this, I&#x27;m one of those guys who seems to have a problem growing facial hair. It takes me awhile to get any hair going. So when I do have to actually shave, it&#x27;s very convinent to have a razor with a cartridge that can get specific areas. Now, thanks to the blades on the Gillette Fusion Proglide manual razor, it&#x27;s no longer an issue to keep trying different ones.&lt;br /&gt;  I was informed of a program by Gillette in which they were giving away razors, so at first I was apprehensive. Once it arrived in the mail however, I quickly changed my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;  Within the first few swipes, I realized it was like shaving with soft cloth. The blades slid across my skin with no problem, neither cutting me nor rubbing too harshly. It seemed easier than usual to get the smaller areas of hair without any hassle. Best of all, my face felt smoother than it ever had with any regular blade.&lt;br /&gt;  With the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual cartridge, shaving was as cool &amp; refreshing as a calm breeze.</li>
    <li> Very great shave!! Closest I&#x27;ve ever had and no razor burn which I&#x27;ve always gotten when I shaved. Only concern is the trimming blade on the back. It&#x27;s super sharp so make sure to keep away from children.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor cartridge blew me away. I received the razor from a program run by Gillette for free. My skin is so smooth. The cartridge provided me with one of the closest shaves I have ever had. The only other thing I could compare this shave to would be getting a shave from a professional barber. The lubrication strip made it so I would not get cut during my shave and it kept my face hydrated. Without a doubt I will be buying these cartridges in the near future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Fusion line before and couldn&#x27;t pass on an opportunity for a blade which was provided via a program run by Gillette. These latest ProGlide cartridges are excellent, but they do have a major downside: they don&#x27;t last as long as previous Fusion blades. However, they are sharper, causing less discomfort. Also just like the old Fusion blades, you have to be really absent minded to get a nick. I&#x27;d say on average I get about 4-10 shaves out of them before I become frustrated and throw them away. That compares to about 6-15 with the old blades. I think they&#x27;re worth it though, because they are simply the nicest, easiest, most comfortable way to shave. Far prefer them to fancy electric razors.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this razor for the last week now and all I have to say is, wow!  It truly is the smoothest razor ive owned.</li>
    <li> the blades are ok but they don&#x27;t really work for my thick facial hair and sensitive skin, but they do cut the hair but they get clogged easily.</li>
    <li> The product did what was advertised.This product was provided via a program run by Gillette It gave a close shave and did not give razorburn.With the blades being closer together it gives a closer shave. The lubrication strip helped to prevent Razorburn. I did notice if the hair was longer it was harder to shave with. It is best to shave when your facial hair is not that long.Shaving against the grain seemed to work a lot better and gave a closer shave. This razor only works well if you shave everyday. Overall I feel that these blades are great.</li>
    <li> I recently received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide, which was provided to me via a program run by Gillette. At first glance the blades look like any other, but where you REALLY notice the difference is when those blades touch your face, and seem to glide across your face. The moisturizing strip helps to keep your skin smooth so the blade can do its job. The feeling I experienced after the shave was great! It was almost a sense of confidence. I would definitely recommend getting one if you haven&#x27;t already. You won&#x27;t regret it. Before the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I used the usual cheap plastic razors. Well never again! The cheapies as I call them, are made as if they put no care into how your face would feel, but Gillette&#x27;s has you covered. I honestly can&#x27;t think of one bad thing to say about this razor. I will definitely be making future purchases from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I finally got my Free Fusion Proglide Razor through a program from Gillette. I opened the box and took out the razor and was amazed at the new stylish design. I have been an avid Gillette user for as long as I can remember and I have never seen a razor like this. The cartridge looks space aged yet stylish.  The five blades feel extremely sharp. I wet my face down, spread on the shave cream and took my first swipe. The cartridge just slid over my face with no tugging or pulling on the hairs. By the time I was done, my face felt as smooth as a babies bottom and no nicks. The conditioning strip left my face feeling smooth and moistureized. I will definitely be keeping this razor as it is the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I received the handle and blade as a promotion item from Gillette.  I find the blades give an excellent smooth close shave without the nixes and cuts of other blade refills.  I have tried other brands of 3+ blade refills and find the Fusion to be much better.</li>
    <li> These blades I received free from gillette are the best shaving blade I have been able to find always give me a comfortable shave with no razor burn definitely recommend these blades just wish they where a little cheaper</li>
    <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for about 8 days.  I received the razor free from Gillette.  I  shave every day.  At least once a week I typically end up nicking myself and have blood somewhere on my neck or face.  With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I have not had one nick.  I have even tried to press harder to make it nick me and it doesn&#x27;t.  It leaves you with an incredibly smooth, close shave and your skin feels moisturized.  I even asked my wife to feel my face when I was finished because it was so smooth.  I love it!  I will recommend it to family and friends and anyone who used a blade to shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for one shave (just got it from a program run via Gillette) 2 days ago) but I got a smooth close shave with no nicks or cuts.  Much better than your typical throw-away razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use a Gillette Mach 3 razor and I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the shave quality.  The razor I choose will depend on the cost of blades.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor in this price range that I&#x27;ve ever used.  The lubrication strips left my skin soft and moisturized instead of tight and dry. Unless you&#x27;re going to spend a ton more cash, this is the best one that I&#x27;ve used in this price range.</li>
    <li> When first receiving the Gillette Fusion Proglide, Thru a special promo offer thru Gillette, I was a little nervous at first. Being a man that always used the cheap-o-depo disposable razors the look and feel of this one was like no other. The 5 blades where smooth to the skin and cut like a dream. And with the single blade touch-up razor, it was nice and easy to get into those hard spots. It was like no other shave before. Now after using the Gillette Fusion Proglide I would not be able to go back to those Cheap-o-Depo razors again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette For A Heck of a shave, The wife loved it........</li>
    <li> As the saying goes you get what you pay for! The blades provide a smooth glide across your gave giving you that just right feeling of a close clean shave. The irritation after the shave is not present. This product is worth one try!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I haven never had a closer shave than this. 5 blades really makes a difference. I&#x27;m upgrading from the disposable shaves and man what a difference. The precision trimmer lets me get into the tough spots like around my goatee. Not only does head cartridge last long, you will also save money in the long run. Even though it was a free razor provided by Gillette is still a product I recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I tried out the Gillette ProGlide razor which was provided via a program run by Gillette. Here is my product review for the performance of the cartridges. The  blades did leave my face feeling smooth... There was no feeling of pulling or cutting. Easy gliding, but I did notice with shorter strokes I had problems cutting the hair around the areas where I was trying to keep my facial hair. I think it was probably because of the lube produced by the razor for smooth cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I got it done and I do like the razor. It was a nice change of pace for my face! I haven&#x27;t looked at prices at retail stores, but I can imagine it is probably not cheap, which would be the only downfall for those on a strict budget.</li>
    <li> Used these once so far and they provide a very smooth shaving experience. Got this from gillette for a free trial.  Have tried Gillette before and seem to have to go over areas more than once but these shave it all the first swipe.</li>
    <li> I recently had the opportunity to get a Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor directly from Gillette, just to give it a whirl. Being one of those guys who shaves their head, I was all over an offer like that. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the blades worked. The pivot head made it much easier to keep the blades on the scalp as I shaved. Gave a nice smooth shave with no nicks or cuts. I also noted that the blades are separated just enough to provide good cleaning. Something that not all razors do. The 4 blade head is doing great after a week, even shaving the old melon daily. My wife wants to steal it to shave her legs, I told her hands off! Have to give this razor cartridge a definite Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I got this razor through a trial program run by Gillete. This razor is absolutely the best razor i have used so far. My facial hair grows extremely fast and my profession requires that i shave every single day and this razor has not skipped a beat. The razor glides smoothly across my face without pulling the hair even after a week of using the same blade. I am definitely switching from the regular brand i use to this razor from now on.</li>
    <li> I got a free razor via a program ran by Gillette so I decided to check it out. Let me tell you the razor is great. Smooth shave that lasts the whole day. Gillette nailed it with this razor. I will definitely continue to use it. Also great for manscaping.</li>
    <li> I try the new  GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE MANUAL and love it you need to buy it you get a best shave with out  razor-burned on your neck</li>
    <li> this razor was given to me for free via a program ran by gillette. this is the best razor that i have ever used. the blades are sharp and do their job with ease. it took very little effort to shave and there was no tug and pull or razor burn. this razor surpasses all other razors that i have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I received a free trial via a program Gillette was running, however that will not color my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the good... This razor left me with an incredibly smooth shave. Shaved much closer than my normal go to Schick Quattro. Unfortunately that is all the good I have to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad... From the very first use the razor was incredibly painful to use, seemed to pull hairs and tug at the skin rather than \\&quot;glide\\&quot; as expected. I&#x27;m highly disappointed in it&#x27;s performance and will remain a faithful user of the Schick Quattro. I cannot tolerate the pain and the slightly closer shave is simply not enough to justify paying nearly twice the price of what I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free from a program run by Gillette to try out and write a review on it. I was actually afraid to use it at first since I only use Gillette razors that vibrate but let me tell you the manual version is just as great. I got a close shave with no cuts or irritation at all. It has a nice lubrastrip on it that helps you out with that part. I would definitely buy this razor again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different types of shaving products to help my skin. I have no problem on the face, but my neck inevitably turns tomato-red every time I shave. So, naturally, I was skeptical when I received this free in a program from Gillette. I assumed that it was going to be more of the same story, a blade that makes big claims, but is no different. To my wonderful surprise, though, the normal pain involved with my shaving (and probably the cause of my red neck)was not present. After several uses, I have to say that this is the best blade I have ever used. It gets a good close shave, but my neck is not tender after and it is my normal skin color. I no longer have to shave early in the day for an event in the evening, worried that my neck will be completely red. This is a great blade for anybody who suffers from razor-burn like I did.</li>
    <li> In order to give a proper review of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual blades I decided to compare them to the blades on my original Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with putting a brand new blade on my Original Gillette Fusion. Then I proceeded to shave half my face with it. I noticed that it did leave noticeable hairs, as it did not catch everything in a few swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades. Starting with a brand new blade I worked on the other side of my face. It took less strokes to get all the hairs leaving none behind and coming out with a very clean smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual cartridge free from a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide via a program run by Gillette and I was very excited to try it. I have sensitive skin and I could definitely tell a difference in the blades of this razor opposed to the other razor that I had been using. I always trust the Gillette brand; as does my wife. She&#x27;s already trying to snatch this one from me! I love the shape and light-weight aspects of this razor - definitely leaves a close, smooth shave! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The razor for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide is the best at-home razor you can get. Other than getting a professional straight razor shave at the barber, this gives me the best shave of my life. You get that smooth feeling, without irritation.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because really - five blades? Sounded like a gimmick to me. But when I got it I was surprised by the legit results! Although I have been a consistent user of the Mach Three Powered razor for years, i received a Fusion ProGlide for free as part of a program run by Gillette. I am a Serbian with real facial hair. When I tried out the ProGlide, I had about 6 days&#x27; growth. There was no grabbing or pulling, just smooth cutting the hair with a single stroke. Even on my upper lip where every razor pulls a little bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, I put lotion on my face and cover it with a hot towel before I shave; softening your beard is key, no matter what you use. But this thing was for real.  I was surprised most that I didn&#x27;t have to come back for a second stroke anywhere.  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> I had been a long time Gillette razor user but in recent months I have been experimenting with different razors. I was given a chance to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor via a promotional program offered by Gillette. After using the cartridge, I was instantly captured by the smooth shave it gave. The thinner blades offer a much closer shave with less irritation. I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin and coarse hair so I&#x27;ve had to compromise a close shave with avoiding irritation. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge offers the best of both worlds - a very smooth shave with little to no irritation. The new lubrastrip allows the razor to glide more easily across the skin and keep the skin moist and lubricated than the standard Gillette Fusion.</li>
    <li> I am an occasional shaver, so my beard is thick, wiry and scraggly. When I first received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide as a part of a trial program, I was skeptical. I needn&#x27;t have been. This cut through the brush and jungle as easily as a hot knife through butter. Plus, the additional lubricated \\&quot;lubrastrip\\&quot; left my skin feeling as soft as silk. All in all, I think I have found my new razor.</li>
    <li> I received a free complimentary razor from Gillette and I gave it a try and I am so glad I did!  It looks like my electric razor is about to head into retirement.  I got the closest shave I have ever gotten with this razor.  I am so satisfied I plan on purchasing a 12 pack of these cartridges.  I did not get any irritation when I shaved and my skin felt so smooth afterwards.  I usually need to shave with my electric razor every other day.  The Proglide gave me so close a shave I did not need to shave for three days!  I can see no downsides to using this razor.</li>
    <li> best razor on the market, and glad that I was able to find the blade refills with an 8 count</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve ordered from these guys a few times now and have been super satisfied every time!</li>
    <li> Stays sharp for quite a while, and shaves smooth. I end up saving money using these blades in comparison to buys loads of cheap disposables.</li>
    <li> My sons favorite. Smooth nice shave.</li>
    <li> I definitely would recommend these blades. They were just as good quality as getting in the store, but for so much less!</li>
    <li> I received my Proglide Fusion free from Gillette few days back for free. I got super smooth shave using proglide. No stings or pains while shaving. With almost all razors, I used to feel pain when shaving under my chin which has hard hair on sensitive area.&lt;br /&gt;It was quick..I didn&#x27;t have go over my skin twice or thrice with this blade.&lt;br /&gt;one smooth stoke and hair is clean.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it.</li>
    <li> These work quite well as a replacement. I love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide and I find the replacements to be quite useful. They are not completely cheaper than they are at Target, but if you find Schick to be a better quality razor brand then stick with what you like. After all, that&#x27;s why I stick with Gillette, it works well for me and I have no problem with purchasing replacement blades since buying disposable razors throughout the year is just as expensive as the replacements.</li>
    <li> I like the idea with the 5 blades</li>
    <li> These razors NEVER LET ME DOWN!</li>
    <li> product meets expectations!</li>
    <li> Gillette makes good razor blades, but soooooo expensive.  Definitely looking into other options.</li>
    <li> I would agree that these are not real blades. They are made differently than the real ones, and the green/blue strip at the top just crumbled off the first time I used the blade.</li>
    <li> Fairly good, but increasingly a ripoff. I use a safety razor now. Saving a lot of money &amp; get a less irritating shave.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy anything else. These are my go-to razors. I&#x27;ve tried Dollar Shave Club and Harry&#x27;s - not a fan. Great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Its ok .. within 8 cartridges.. some are bad some are good</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Razor Cartridges&lt;br /&gt; June 24, 2014 by blc61070&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed trying the Gillette Fusion Razor that I received for free to try from Gillette. The blades gave me a very smooth shave and I did not knick myself once during the time I used the them. My only complaint is that the cartridges are pretty pricey to the point I would find it a better deal to just purchase a new starter set instead of refill cartridges.</li>
    <li> About a month or so ago, my Fusion power blades were running out.  While at Costco, I picked up a bunch of the newer Fusion Proglide blades.  Every since, shaving has become a painful experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is not very thick, so I often shave every other day.  This has proven to be near impossible with this newer blade.  Every morning is a painful one.  If I shave daily, the blade is OK, but it dulls quickly.  The older Fusion lasted a long time, much longer than I ever expected.  I haven&#x27;t gone through this many blades so quickly in decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved with Gillette blades for decades, and very much dislike the Schick system.  But if I can&#x27;t get the older blades anymore, I might just go back to a Mach III, which was still a very good product.  Either that, or an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> These blades are pretty good.  I mainly got them because I shave my head  and with cheaper razors,  I am more likely to have at least one or two nicks. The only thing I noticed about these is that I have to go over the same area more than once, as the blades dont always seem to completely clear out a spot the first time. I am guessing that the same design implementation that spares me from cutting myself may be behind this. This is a minor issue though, since I would rather go over the same area 2 or 3 times than have a cut there instead.  But that is why I gave the 4 star rating instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Overpriced blades that clog after the first use.</li>
    <li> These blades work well and they last longer</li>
    <li> Great price... better than buying them at grocery stores. Very durable as well. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love these razors set ! Work very well</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard, and have had a life-long project looking for blades that giive me the smoothest shave possible -- and last longer than a few days.  The Fusion blade does the trick.  It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but the cost is mosre than offset by each blade lasting a full month before it needs to be replaced.  As said, I&#x27;ve got a heavy beard, and no other blade I&amp;#34;ve used came close to lasting this long -- or shaved virtually nick-free.</li>
    <li> Not sure what others were receiving, but mine was the real thing (easily identifiable by the laser-etched ID on the underside of each cart). Getting 8 cartridges for $14 (including the $6 coupon from Amazon) is the lowest price I have ever encountered.</li>
    <li> Great price!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very close shave with Fusion. It is quite a shaving system. Those 5 blades really shave close and the cartridges last a long time. Make sure you also get the Fusion intensive cooling lotion to put on your skin after your shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor blades just so expensive.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that has been used by this consumer for several years... thus bought replacement blades when making another order with Amazon... UNFORTUNATELY, I did not check prices... could have bought locally cheaper... live and learn...</li>
    <li> this is the only one I use</li>
    <li> Excellent more importantly genuine, not a knock off.</li>
    <li> My second order, and I am sure it won&#x27;t be my last. Blades last for quite a while and are comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> These are the real Gillette Fusion blades.  You have to be very careful where you get these blades, there are a lot of Chineese made counterfeit blades packaged identical to these and priced much less.  These are the blades that don&#x27;t need battery power, they are the basic old Fusion blades.  I typically get about two weeks out of a blade.  The green lubricant strip on the blade shows you when you should change the blade.</li>
    <li> Will give a very good shave, but is also over priced.</li>
    <li> It came very fast and the package was just like the one you buy at the store.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product with a price that is lower than my local stores.</li>
    <li> The price not so good</li>
    <li> Expensive, but very good.</li>
    <li> Great price!  Our son got us in to ordering on line</li>
    <li> New blades are much smoother than previous versions.</li>
    <li> Great deal on subscription, hopefully they stay that well priced.</li>
    <li> Hey every man who has ever tried these loves them, but the price just seems such a gouge for what you get.</li>
    <li> Ordering info too difficult to bother with.  Too cumbersome to select producrt. Rather pricy.</li>
    <li> Results in fewer scrapes and less &amp;#34;hamburger&amp;#34; effect than any other option. I just wish they were not so costly.</li>

    <li> Fit great in the fusion razor.  Works good for a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Can make good and close shaving when it is new. After 3 weeks of daily use, I can feel the blades are a little blunt and uncomfortable. I will have to replace with a new one within a month.</li>
    <li> This blade is the best blade I have used so far. I shave alternate days. This blade keeps irritation to lowest and gives good shave. This is definitely better than older version of Fusion. Price is also comparable to warehouse stores.</li>
    <li> I was led to believe from the product description that I was buying a blade that would also fit my Gillette Mach3 handle. That is not so - probably my mistake? However, I decided to buy the Fusion profiled handle so I could use the new blades. I am very happy with them; much smoother than the Mach3 blades.</li>
    <li> Gillette keeps changing the design of the blades so you have to buy new razors. Now I would be fine with this if the blades would just last. Unfortunately the cost a ton and you never get more than a week out of a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work very well, but expensive and don&#x27;t last long!</li>
    <li> Very good. I always order these blades and are always satisfied</li>
    <li> These are great blades. I wish I found these years ago. No razor burn now and the blades last about a month.</li>
    <li> Well, I used these and I didn&#x27;t have hair on my face anymore. I&#x27;d say these worked. Can&#x27;t beat the price, too.</li>
    <li> These blades seem better than the blades I have been using and give a great shave.  An upgrade?  Perhaps, but a fine product.</li>
    <li> Best razor out there.</li>
    <li> The brand says it all.  Great blades.</li>
    <li> Having tried this product when it first came out i feel qualified to review it. I used this product for many years then someone introduced me to a smaller company and I decided to try their products. Since I had them I tried them. I was offered to receive a free razor through a program run by gillette. I decided this would be the perfect opportunity to try the blades again.  After the first shave I dont know why I ever switched. I get the closest shave with them and it feels smooth all day. The blades wash clean very easily with just a quick rinse. They do seem to last a good while but the strip wears out sooner then I  would like which causes some irritation but if you are consistent with changing your blades then you will have no problems and will be very happy with them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way too expensive but its the best shave I have ever received. Also I have noticed the razor depreciates when not in use rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette should have easier mechanism for clearing out shaved facial hair, right now I simply place it under the tap. Wish it was easier cause I am paying way too much for shaving.</li>
    <li> I, like many of you, now shave with the extremely comfortable 5 blade Gillette Fusion razor cartridge system . Once you shave with this technology, you never go back, all of you that shave with a blade know exactly what I mean. The problem is, as all of you also know, the price: at Walmart, I pay $37 for 12 cartridges, cowabunga, that&#x27;s $3.08 each (and worth every penny).&lt;br /&gt;No more!&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a new German company, Harry&#x27;s, that ships you (free shipping), a razor and cartridges exactly like Fusion (in fact, I think they&#x27;re even more comfortable, if that&#x27;s possible). Their cost is $25 for 16 cartridges, $1.56, about 1/2 of what I pay for Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with the shave I get with this razor! The starter kit with handle, shaving cream (adequate) and 3 cartridges is $15. [...]</li>
    <li> good, not exceptional shave...... as are all blades iI believe this is over priced .... should give the razor away for free just to get the profil from the blades...</li>
    <li> These blades are great! In my opinion, they are better than the simple fusion blades because they have the single blade on the back to cut hairs close to your nose and ears.</li>
    <li> I have had really bad razor burn/irritated skin post shaving ever since my first shave.  After a few decades, laser hair removal was being considered.  These razors have at least put that plan on hold for a while.  Great razors!</li>
    <li> I Love the shave I get with these blades. Leaves me looking smooth with no bumps or cuts, and they last a long time!!!</li>
    <li> One of the most awesome razors I have ever used :)</li>
    <li> For years I used Gillette Mach 3 blades and was very satisfied. A few months ago I realized my razor was long in the tooth and decided to buy a more modern and \\&quot;improved\\&quot; Gillette product, so I bought the Fusion Proglide at my local Walgreens. It came with 2 blades. The first blade was satisfactory and gave me nice shaves. It lasted several weeks, as did the older Mach 3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should explain that I am retired and have a rather light, fine beard. I normally shave every other day now, since I don&#x27;t need to appear in an office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first blade was done, I began using the second. Surprise! After just a few shaves, it wouldn&#x27;t shave well at all. I had to go over and over my face to get a close shave, and even then it left very short, visible stubble, which with fine hair is really unusual. I think the blade lasted 2 weeks, about 6 shaves, which for me is ridiculously short. I figured I had a bad blade, so ordered this refill package from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, after having these refills for less than a month, I inserted my third blade, since the first two dulled noticeably after 4 or 5 shaves. Obviously, something is wrong here. I noticed that they have the blue band, as some people have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it the blades? Is it the razor? I don&#x27;t know and it&#x27;s just outside of the time when I could return these to Amazon, so I will suffer through and make another choice when they are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A straight razor sounds dangerous and I hate electric shavers, so from now on it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;a mystery as to what I will do, since I have used Gillette products since a teenager, with the old double-edged blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette, what have you done?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: September 6, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered that the problem with my blades was the shaving gel I was using, which was quite thick and gummed up the blades, so that I had to clean them with Qtips after each use. That solved part of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real solution came when I began using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Organic Shaving Gel, which is thin and gives a nice base for shaving on my skin. This solved my problem and I now find that my blades are as great as the used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore I&#x27;m now giving these blades a 5 star rating, as my shaves are super.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette was kind enough to send me coupons for new blades.

    <li> works like i just bought it out of the store. clean shave</li>
    <li> Produces the smoothest shave ever! I have used it ever since it became available and wouldn&#x27;t switch for anything! It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> They provide a close, smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Very Nice to use and I coud use those for Power version as well ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not find better one yet so far ... thus stay with.</li>
    <li> What can I say - i have this razor so i bought these.  All eight of them were of the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it.  nothing really more to say.</li>
    <li> Was down to my last blade knew i had to shave before i could buy more these arrived as advertised in excellent condition and way ahead of the estimated delivery date right when i needed them outstanding couldn&#x27;t have shown up at a better time if you tried best shave ever right when i needed easy to order will be doing future business</li>
    <li> As you know these blades are expensive and buying in bulk helps. Ideal way to keep the blades stocked in the cabinet....</li>
    <li> These are good refills, but with any razor refill, the price is a bit high.  Gives a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product , feels that&#x27;s girlfriend like me more , and for my baby face to stay a babyface</li>
    <li> So I tried the Gilette Fusion manual cartridge for the first time with gilette fusion shaving cream and it was extremely smooth. There were no bumps or scratches and very little irritation compared to other cartridges I used. Usually I use a power razor handle which I like more as it gives a little bit of a massage but this cartridge would be amazing on that. I recommend using these cartridges regardless of what handle you use.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have tried many blades but none ever did the job, I almost gave up on blades. I tried this one and it worker wonders. Zero razor burn or cuts. The wide blade makes quick work, which I love.</li>
    <li> It allows you to shave easily without any troubles, easy to use. Shaves smoothly, Price is set at a good place as well and recommend it to you.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that the pro glide would be better than the fusion but I was wrong.  The grip in better, the blades are better, pretty much everything about it is better.  It even works great going against the grain.</li>
    <li> i got a very close shave with this razor. almost zero drag! i would recommend this to anyone looking for a great shave</li>
    <li> I got these recently through a promotion from Gillette, though I&#x27;ve used them before. I&#x27;m in the military, so shaving my face is a must, and having a comfortable close shave is important. Gillette really outdid themselves when they came out with these. These are the best blades to ever have touched my face. I love that they last as long as they do as well. Use after use, I get zero irritation and a nice, close shave. Granted, I&#x27;m no Grizzly Adams, but my point still stands. This is the highlander of razor blades. Like my review title says, Last blade ever.</li>
    <li> How long a razor cartridge lasts varies from person to person, as it is dependent on many variables such as beard toughness and thickness, beard preparation, shaving habits, and skin sensitivity. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power&#x27;s reformulated Indicator lubricating strip will provide you with a visual cue - it fades to white - when optimal shave conditions have been reduced. When this happens, you may want to change your cartridge for a more comfortable shave. This razor was free provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> I would like to start off by saying that I love the redesigned precision trimmer, I was able to shape the look and hit some of the trickiest spots that I just couldn&#x27;t in the past. As for the blades I find that by going with thinner blades reduced cuts and breakouts I used to get because of how sensitive my skin is.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus about the blades is that they are very easy to rinse when you are done. All in all the razor is a lot better this time around and will provide you with the close smooth shave you have been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to thank Gillette for providing me with this free razor.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin so finding a razor that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin is hard. I have used this razor 4 times now and it hasn&#x27;t left my face or neck irritated our puffy once. Pretty happy i decided to try this out.</li>
    <li> The Gillete Fusion Proglide was the first razor of mine that was not a cheap disposable razor and I must say I can see the difference. Shaving has never been such a breeze, the blades remain sharp with constant use. Unlike the cheap disposable razors I have not gotten any razor burn. The part I like about the razor is that the replacement blades are readily available at any major store. Definitely a great product!</li>
    <li> I love the design on the blades they are thin and there are four, I think this did help for my sensitive skin.  After I was done with my shave I did not have the red bumps or irritation on my face so needless to say I am a happy camper.  The razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. ~ Yunior</li>
    <li> I get bad razor burn on my neck though my face usually holds up well, but I felt pretty comfortable using this even against the grain on neck. The razor was made available to me in a program by Gillette, and I may actually be sold that the price of Gillette blades are worth it. In general blades are expensive, but having to shave daily for work - it seems I finally found a blade worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor through a program from the company itself. Great shave.  Got really close with little effort, it really does glide over the skin.  Did cause slight razor bumps in my neck area, but overall a great product.  Definite improvement over my older Gillette products!</li>
    <li> This razor gives me a close shave SAFELY! My skin is very sensitive when it comes to shaving.Im very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide was provided to me via a program run by Gillette. The cartridge may look like other razor cartridges but you can never judge anything on looks alone. You can feel the difference once the blades touch your face for the first time. It leaves your face feeling smooth and soft to the touch. I couldnt ask for a better cartridge for my face.</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a program run by gillette to test it. I absolutely LOVED it. It is the smoothest shave that I have ever felt. There is no tugging, and it just litterally glides over your face, to give you baby smooth skin. Amazing razor!!!</li>
    <li> I received these blades through a program run by Gillette. They seem to provide a very smooth shave even on hair I had not shaved in several days. They didn&#x27;t pull even on the thicker stuff. The lubricating strips are nice for when you have to go over a spot a second time. The trimmer blade on the back works well for trimming sideburns. They seem to be nicer than my disposable razors, but not sure they are worth the price difference. Overall a nice product, but not sure I would spend the additional money to purchase them.</li>
    <li> This razor was simply amazing. I tried this razor due to a program that Gillette was running where I received a free sample. The shave was so close my girl loved it! I will continue to stock up on these blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using el cheapo razor for as long as I can remember. I was provided these razor blades by Gillette so I could compare them to my old disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt; All I can say is wow. I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing. The multiple blades made shaving quick, no razor burn from having to go over the same place multiple times. The extra blade on the back dispelled my concern that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get a precise shave in the spots where my beard turns.&lt;br /&gt; These blade are awesome. Though I was a bit concerned that the large heads would make shaving feel weird, once I got used to it, it was actually easier and quicker. It is definitely worth the switch.</li>
    <li> These blades are the best, bar none. I shave my head and  these blades keeps me smooth as a bowling ball for days.</li>
    <li> I have used a various amount of razors, but this razor has to be my favorite one. I received a trial razor ,and now I am a permanent customer. Thanks to Gillette&#x27;s special promotion, I was able to get a free gillette fusion proglide and try this great product!</li>
    <li> this cartridge are the best, super durable and the closest shave you&#x27;ll find. I know it can be pricey but let me tell you its worth it!!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used! The cartridge has 5 blades and the blue lubricating strip which left my face feeling smoother than ever! I received this from a trial that Gillette was doing and love it! Less irritation, closer shave!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor from a program run through Gillette. Let me start off by saying this is hands-down the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used for everyday shaving. You can tell with the new and improved lubrastrip that it really makes a difference! It leaves your face feeling smooth and fresh, this is definitely better than any other razor on the shelf and I will continue to buy more cartridges for this snazzy new razor!</li>
    <li> I got away from using manual razors for a few years now because they just did not give me a close shave and they always cut my neck. I received this one from a program Gillette is doing to let you try it free. I have used the rezor twice now with no neck cuts and a clean, close shave. I may be switching back from electric to the Gillette ProGlide.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Tried other brands of 3- 5 blade razors occasionally and nothing compares. I get about a month out of each refill although I usually don&#x27;t shave on weekends. My wife says they are the bomb and work better than the lady fusion razors.</li>
    <li> Even with 5 Blades, I can still get my &amp;#34;Kirk Douglas&amp;#34; dimple clean cut!  No razor burn like other brands either.  Great Product!!!!</li>
    <li> Blades, they work, they cost a ton...</li>
    <li> I grew up de shaving and got back into using double edge blades about 3 years ago. But I still use these blades when I&#x27;m pressed for time. I feel I get a nice clean smooth shave with no irritation. The blades came quickly (prime) and were packed well. I purchased the new flex head razor and actually enjoy using this combo. I would definitely recommend and buy again. Sorry if I offended any DE purists.</li>
    <li> I received this product from Gillette.  I am already a Gillette user as I use the regular Fusion.  I didn&#x27;t think there would be much difference between the two but after using it I can definitely see a difference.  I waited to use the razor a few times before making my review and each time I could tell a difference of how much closer of a shave the Proglide provided.  The use of the razor is a bit smoother than the regular as well.  I will be switching to the Proglide.</li>
    <li> My husband usually switches blades every couple of weeks, he says he&#x27;s been using the same one for the past month and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
    <li> They give a good shave, but are ridiculously expensive.</li>
    <li> This shaver is waaay overrated and quite goofy.  I have TWO MAIN complaints.  1.  I hate how far the bottom blade is from the end of the razor ie that big blue thing on the bottom that serves no purpose - why is this an issue? For shaving under my nose - upwards - and even downwards there is a lot of space.  I wish the blade was closer to the end so I can shave effectively under my nose -and NO - I don&#x27;t wanna use that dumb trimming blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. When you wanna get REAL close and stretch your skin and go over - I can&#x27;t catch the whiskers with these blades for some reason, on a certain part of my face - I was trying yesterday like between my cheek and chin and I kept going over and using my tongue to get the skin to go out and went over it like crazy and these blades wouldn&#x27;t catch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my last Fusion blade - and I&#x27;m glad - I&#x27;m gonna switch to a Schick product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette is waaay overrated - I used Gillette Sensor 3 disposables once and cut my face all up.  They do these goofy flexballs and stuff and don&#x27;t even have a good safe simple razor that cuts close and easily after all these years - a couple weeks ago I gashed my chin with the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better razors than this.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the proglide blade from Gillette, it&#x27;s a good close shave. It has spendy blade refills but you can find them less expensive than here. The no slip grip on the handle worked decent too, but honestly I don&#x27;t pay much attention to that. This is a good clean shave if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a program ran by Gillette, I had the opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor.  The cartridges are perfect!  The blades are SUPER sharp and fine and the new precision trimmer is the perfect addition to the cartridge.  It allows me to maneuver into tight spots (around the ears, mustache, even the back of my neck).  The large lubrastrip is moisturizing enough that I didn&#x27;t even have to use aftershave...bonus!  Being that I shave everyday or every other day, a good razor is absolutely essential and I think this cartridge fits the bill.  I&#x27;ll definitely be using this cartridge on a regular basis and would highly recommend it to any other regular shavers.  The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars rather than five is cost...I wish they were priced a little bit more reasonably.  Other than that, this is perfect!</li>
    <li> I must say thanks to Gillette for sending this razor to me for free through a program they had run.  I have sensitive skin that is easily cut buy other blades.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide is extremely comfortable.  I have used it a few times and have experienced a close comfortable shave each time.  The blade glides effortlessly over my skin, and leaves my skin smooth and with no cuts!  I love this razor and will be switching to this from now on.</li>
    <li> Although costly, the blades from the Gillette Fusion ProGlide are very fine and very durable. They give a nice shave and are very last longing. No tugs or pulls when shaving, giving a nice clean shave and no burns when putting on the aftershave which was really amazing. Nothing compared to other razors I have previously used.</li>
    <li> This razor is great! I got this razor through a program hosted by gillette. I definitely think the 5 blades helps the shave be better.  Very close shave and have not had to shave as often with this razor.</li>
    <li> i got this from a promotion run by gillette and the blades glide alot smoother than others and what i like most about this is that it has a extra blade on top of the cartridge which makes it easier to shave below your nose</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using the Mach 3 razor but decided to give the Fusion ProGlide a shot.  Five blades really are better than three!  It&#x27;s amazing how close and clean this shave feels.  Also, I have very sensitive skin, but after shaving with the ProGlide, I did not have any irritation or soreness.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to go with this razor and can&#x27;t wait show off my clean face!</li>
    <li> I received the blades from Gillette to try them out.. I thought the blades were amazing. They gave me an extremely close shave and left me very smooth to the touch.. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good smooth shave!</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide to try as part of a promotion from Gillette and at first glace I didn&#x27;t think it looked any different than the previous Fusion cartridges I have used. If you look really close though, you will see that these cartridges have 5 thin blades in them. The blades are a slightly thinner than the ones in previous Fusion cartridges but that in and of itself is not enough to make these better. These cartridges are smooth. Seriously, they glide so smoothly over my face that I wondered if it was ever working. The result was a close, smooth shave that did not leave my face irritated the way cheap razors often do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it? Yes. If not for the higher cost of the cartridges, this would be my new razor for sure.</li>
    <li> Tried the  Gillette Fusion  Proglide  Blades, they  give  an  excellent smooth  close  shave . Well  worth  the  money  spent to  me compared  to  other  brands  i  have  tried .</li>
    <li> I received this shaver and was excited to try it out. I like the fact that it had 4 blade and flexible handle. I used it and it glided around my face very smoothly. When I was done I noticed I had 2 small cuts on my face other than that my face was super smooth. I would recommend this product to all my friends. This shaver was just great.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me a free blade to try out. This was the manual version that did not have the battery powered vibrations in it. At first the blade shaved VERY smoothly and cut through hair very nicely. It has a very nice grip and seems to \\&quot;float\\&quot; in your hand. It does not take much work to grip the handle. It is also nice to be able to change out blades for fresh blades. The color scheme is pretty cool as well. It also comes with a very nice holder. The single blade at the top of the unit is also very nice for getting the nooks and crannies that I am not able to get with the larger 5 blade main unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was disappointed with the length that the blade stays sharp. It seemed to have lost it&#x27;s nice very sharp edge after about 4-6 shaves. In addition the blades are VERY expensive to replace, even when I used eBay to obtain replacement blades. The cost of the blades is very high. In the future I have decided to move to a safety blade as it is much more cost effective. The moisturizing strip at the head of the blade also seems to deteriorate very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a nice shave with a very nice grip, this razor will be great for you. However, you are going to have a VERY high cost for replacement blades as you are likely paying a high premium for much of the marketing.</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide free from Gillette.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised.  It gave me a much closer shave than any razor I tired before.  Plus my wife loved how smooth my face was.  My facial hair does not grow in often so I only have to shave every few days usually.  The proglide allows me to sneak in an extra day of laziness with its closeness.  Gillette, you win.  I am switching to Proglide!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge for free through a program run by Gillette. I was skeptical because I have pretty sensitive skin and I usually have to choose between a bad shave or broken out skin. The cartridges on this razor worked fantastic for my skin! My face felt smooth after due to the sharpness of the razor blades and I had no skin irritation due to the lubrastrip. I was also able to get to the hard to reach places like the spot right under the nose and straight sideburns. I will not use another razor again!</li>
    <li> The Gillette ProGlide seems to be the answer to my age old question - \\&quot;Will I ever stop getting irritated skin when I shave?\\&quot; My skin is extremely sensitive, sometimes more sensitive than I can bare. My usual shave is rough, and sometimes I just use a trimmer to avoid the irritation. I no longer have to worry about that: with the ProGlide, I felt no irritation what so ever, and the shave was smoother then any other razor I&#x27;ve tried to date. The lubricants actually serve a great purpose, and I was able to get a perfect shave on very little shaving cream. The precision trimmer offers to me, something I never knew I needed; a clean shave in between the eye brows, and on the ear-side of the side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking for a fantastic performing razor, I would urge you to give this a shot, you won&#x27;t regret it! I received mine as part of a campaign by Gillette, and fell in love with it instantly!</li>
    <li> I recently received a free gillette razor to try.  It leaves your skin feeling smooth and refreshed.  Usually, my skin gets irrated, but with this razor, it make my skin feel young again.  It is by far the best razor I have found to shave with.  I will buy this brand to use instead of my usual brand.  Gillette keeps getting better and knows what a man needs to make the women in his life happy</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results of the fusion Proglide. I received the razor through a promotion put on by Gillette. I was shocked at the difference from my old razor, the Mach 3 (which was a great razor and I didn&#x27;t think I had any reason to be unhappy) the mach 3 caused a lot more irritation than the fusion proglide. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> Every once in a while I find myself in the shaving aisle at the local store wondering if all of those different razors are any better than their competition. Thanks to Gillette, who provided me with a free Pro glide through a product trial, I was able to find out. The first thing I noticed is how well constructed the blades are. The housing that holds them is very solid and compact, which also means it&#x27;s easier to get around some of those harder to shave spots. After following my usual pre shave routine, I picked up the razor and put it to the test. I was surprised. These blades are very smooth. There was almost no drag at all, which means less razor burn and irritation. After the first pass, almost all of my stubble was gone. Not only are these blades great for sensitive skin, they save time since I didn&#x27;t have to make to or three passes. The only thing I would change would be the lubrication strip. In my opinion it needs a bit more slickness to it, but otherwise this is a great product. I would not hesitate to start using the Pro Glide as my everyday Razor.</li>
    <li> I got to try these blades through a program from Gillette. When I tried it I noticed that the blades gave a smooth shave. The blades didn&#x27;t seem to tug as much as other razors I have used. I like the anti clog system on top, but I think it is smaller than another brand and may clog if you had thicker hair. I think the blades are pricey, and I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference with these blades than the other fusions. I actually prefer the blade that goes with the power razor I think it felt much better and gave a better shave. For now I will stick to what I was using before.</li>
    <li> I am a avid travler and shaver.  I have received this product free as a marketing purposes.  I am Italian and have a scruffy beard and facial hair.  I sometimes have issues with bumps, cuts, and partial areas unshaved.  But since i have used this product I have a worry free shave.  No bumps, cuts, or leaving areas partially unshaved.  The light green blue lubricant strip helps with the bumps or cuts.  The 5 blade action allows me to not go over my face 2 or 3 times, its gets everything in one close shave and I like that.  It leaves my skin with a baby smooth feel.  When traveling I tend to use the razors that the hotel provides.  Not no more, I will taking this with me everywhere I go so I can feel fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I was able to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide, free of charge, through a program ran by Gillette and I have to say that I am very impressed with the quality of this razor blade. It gives you a very close shave and literally \\&quot;glides\\&quot; across stubble without any razor burn. I absolutely loved trying out this great razor from Gillette and definitely will be looking to buy more products from them in the future!</li>
    <li> I received my new razor today from the try out program from gillette and had to use it right away. I was joyfully surprised on how smooth of a shave I really got, the thinner design of the blades lead to little to no irritation like my old razor, and love the trimmer blade. being able to make crisp lines without having to grab another trimmer speeds up the process of shaving and saved me  lots of time. I believe I will stick with this razor for a while..lol</li>
    <li> I like this razor. It works great. It cuts smooth and leaves my skin feeling great! The slim handle is easy to maneuver.</li>
    <li> Wow what a difference a blade can make. This sharp, but not overpowering blade glides through your whiskars with ease. It is smooth and cleanly lifts your hair from your skin. I was able to try this razor through a program by Gillette and it was well worth it. My face felt baby smooth and not roughy like typical disposable blades would do to your skin. It also has added lubrication to cool and relieve your skin from redness and soreness. When you need a great feel good shave with a razor trust a brand known for quality Gillette and get rid of those pesky whistkars :).</li>
    <li> I shave only when I have to, due to the discomfort of the blades on my sensitive skin. I usually break out, but with the pro glide I did not have this trouble. I loved it and so did the wife. she hates when I do not shave. With this blade system she will not have to worry about me not shaving anymore</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a Gillette promotion. I have used Fusion razors before, but not in the past year or so. Boy, do I miss them! Best razors by far. A bit expensive, perhaps, but they last much longer than other competitors and provide a much more consistent shave.</li>
    <li> Keep the blades clean then dry before you store them and it will last for awhile. I like having the moisture strip  but wish it lasted longer but it is the same as the rest.</li>
    <li> I was sent the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor as a promotional item from Gillette. The razor works well. I&#x27;m getting smooth shaves and not leaving any cuts or nicks. It&#x27;s got nice contours and fits in the well about like any of Gillette&#x27;s other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On on the downside, I&#x27;m not sure what real benefit the razor offers in comparison to past mach 3&#x27;s or similar quality competitor razors that I&#x27;ve been using for years. I don&#x27;t find my shave substantially improved by having more than 2 or 3 blades in parallel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a solid razor, but I&#x27;m not sure how much of an upgrade it&#x27;d be from a similar multi-blade razor.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided free via a program run by Gillette. Thanks to the lubricated strip I shaved half of my face without shaving cream!  I am very impressed with this razor.  It provided a close, smooth shave that is important to me when going out on the town!  One other bonus I found with this razor was that when I rinsed the hair off, it did not get stuck between the blades.  The precision trimmer blade was very useful in making a clean cut!</li>
    <li> The new Gillette Fusion Proglide razor does live up to a long line of upgrades and still remains a superior razor to its competition.  When used vs. the Mach 3,  a very similar close shave is attained. The fusion battery operated devise does feel a little awkward on the skin at first, and perhaps if you have heavier growth it might make a difference, but for thinner growth, doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of a difference vs the Mach 3.  The 5 blades are very smooth, but also seem to wear out much faster and are extremely expensive to replace.  It seems the better value would not buy the blades, but continue to find coupons and just buy the razor and use the blades that are included in the package.  However when compared with other brands,  the Gillette family of razors still dominate for comfort, quality and smoothness of the shave.  It&#x27;s really hard to find a competitor that&#x27;s even close. It&#x27;s clear P&amp;G understand what they are doing, its too bad the price is so expensive, but that&#x27;s what happens when there&#x27;s virtually no competition. Overall, the Fusion Proglide is consistent, smooth, and everything that you&#x27;d expect from a Gillette razor.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Manual Cartridge free through a promotion from Gillette. I have coarse facial hair and sensitive skin, which is a rough combination. The Proglide Fusion cartridge gave a smooth shave, which is hard to achieve with my combination of coarse facial hair and sensitive skin. I have to be really particular about the razor blade; I use.  The Fusion ProGlide Blade was great for my sensitive skin; the 4 ultra-thin blades did not cause razor burn. Razor burn is a serious problem for me. I also felt the lubrastrip helped keep my face moisturized, which helped reduce the chance of getting razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly loved the re-designed precision trimmer; because I have a goatee and with the precision trimmer I was able to trim my upper lip easily.</li>
    <li> I had an opportunity to try out for free the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge through a program from Gillette and I must say that I am very surprised by the ease and sharpness of the blades. My skin is very sensitive to the ravages of traditional shavings. I am always trying to find products that are mindful of people with sensitive skin. Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge is one such products.&lt;br /&gt;The lubricants did not irritated my skin like other blades did. I usually use an electric shaver to shave my facial hair and usually had little to moderate irritation. Not with these blades! My skin was smooth and i had very little discomfort. Thank you Gillette for letting me try this great new product. I won&#x27;t be using any other brands from now on.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor, Nice close shave with no burn or bumps left behind....recommend it for people with slightly sensitive skin that want a close shave</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a manual razor because I have a very thick beard and I always get razor burn, but I had to give the ProGlide a shot. Gillette was kind enough to give me a free razor to put it to the test through one of their programs. Usually my razor will get snagged in my beard, but the ProGlide just cut right through with ease. I even shaved against the grain on my neck without any problem. After my quick and painless shave I noticed I had no razor burn or bumps. I highly recommend this shaver to anyone who has sensitive skin or just wants a hassle free shave.</li>
    <li> Loved this razor. I&#x27;m usually a shick user, but I thought I would try out the Gillette Fusion. I loved the detail blade on the back side. So convenient. The main blade was sharp as a tack and I honestly didn&#x27;t have a nick on my face. You have GOT to try the Fusion out.</li>
    <li> ***free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the blades on the razor. the shave is consistent, nick free, and I get the closest shave possible. The lubricating strips are great as they keeps my face protected from irritation. The blade also lasts a while so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was sent the razor through a program run by Gillette to try it out. Overall, this is the best razor that I&#x27;ve ever shaved with. The best part about it was that it didn&#x27;t clog even after going two to three days between shaving. It has a trimming blade which is nice but wouldn&#x27;t be a deal breaker for me. The blades(5 of them) are thin and provide a very smooth and close shave. I would definitely use this again!</li>
    <li> This Gillette Fusion Proglide Cartridges were provided via a program run by Gillette. Everytime I needed to shave I always tried to avoid doing it. The razors I have used that were not from Gillette always caused me pain. It felt as if the blades are plucking my hairs out and irritated the area. But after using these blades I probably will not use anything else other than Gillette blades.</li>
    <li> I receive these blades for free by a program ran by Gilette, I absolutely loved them. There was no tearing and more cutting. Although these did not knick and cut up my skin. Will by using these again for sure</li>
    <li> Compared to any other razor, including the original Gillette Fusion, this blade is far better. For me, this could be called the \\&quot;One stroke wonderful\\&quot; razor. I did not have to go over my trouble spots a second time like I would with other blades. Extremely smooth! The precision blade was EXCELLENT in getting the stubble removed that is right under my nose.</li>
    <li> I received a free blade from a program run by Gillette Fusion ProGlide and I&#x27;m happy that I did! Most blades have a hard time cutting the hair on my cheeks and leave stubble on my neck as well as cuts. The ProGlide left no hair on my cheeks or neck. My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry or irritated after a shave either. A great simple razor, what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> The refills cartridge are a little pricey, but they&#x27;re worth it!!! They last longer than any other manual shavers. It really does provide a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well. It left a close shave. I will be buying more in the future. The blades are pricey but worth it. I got to try this product for free through a promotion through Gillette.</li>
    <li> Fantastic razors -- expensive but worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion and found it to be a great experience overall. It did not cut my face and it was a very smooth shave. The lubrication strip allowed it to glide easily and never gave me any issues. I&#x27;d recommend these for everyone!</li>
    <li> Gillette usually has a pretty good product to begin with, however, I really enjoyed shaving with this razor. I was given the opportunity to try this razor via a program that is run by Gillette. The glide was much smoother than other razors. I shave my face and my head, so a smooth, close shave is what I like and need. I shaved on a Monday and didn&#x27;t have to shave again until Wednesday or Thursday, I would have to shave every other day with any other razor.</li>
    <li> Well to start off I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual cartridge for free as part of a program provided by Gillette. But It&#x27;s the razor that I already have in my medicine cabinet, That&#x27;s okay I&#x27;ll gladly take another! Gillette is my go to brand and I cant see myself using another brand I have to have a clean completely shaven face for work every day and this razor gets close without cutting and removes all the little stubble! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Been using this cartridge for a week now and it really does GLIDE. I did receive this razor via a program run by Gillette but it is definitely a lot better than those cheap one or two blade disposable razors. You really get what you pay for with this. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my facial hair isn&#x27;t very thick but usually one to two rounds over the same spot and it&#x27;s smooth. No pulling or snagging and definitely no razor burn!!! I usually use shaving gel to make sure all my shaves are smooth, so I can&#x27;t really say if the enhanced lubrastrip was effective or not, but I didn&#x27;t have any problems or mis-cuts with it.</li>
    <li> I received a free Fusion Proglide razor and blades through a program from Gillette.  I normally use a rechargeable electric but my beard is so coarse that I&#x27;d have to go back with a razor to get it all.  I tried the ProGlide blades and really like the clean shave I get with them.  Due to my schedule I have even had to shave with just the blade and water and the blades still did not irritate my face.  I do rinse the whiskers out of the blades while and after shaving and dry it with a towel and even after a few weeks the blades are still shaving well even with shaving twice a day.</li>
    <li> I really like the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual razor.  I received a free trial razor through a program run by Gillette.  The blades cut my facial hair effectively and the lubricating strip worked well enough that even after my shaving cream had been wiped off, my face didn&#x27;t get irritated.  One weakness is that the razor wasn&#x27;t nimble enough to get the hair at the very corners of my mouth.  Another weakness is that if I hadn&#x27;t shaved for a while, the blades would get clogged with hair, forcing me to spend time wiping the hair out before I could continue shaving.  I still haven&#x27;t found a razor that doesn&#x27;t get clogged though, so that&#x27;s not unique to the Gillette Fusion. Finally, the blades were safe as I didn&#x27;t cut myself shaving at all.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample Gillette Fusion ProGlide and was a little skeptical when I first saw the five blades on the cartridge. I mean really, how many blades does one razor need? Then I tried it and I&#x27;ll never go back to my dinky three-blade razor again. The Fusion ProGlide blade provides a smoother shave and doesn&#x27;t tug against my beard, especially when shaving against the grain. The one blade on the back is less useful to me, but does help get rid of the excess hair between my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for over 15 years now after joining the military in 1998 and have been using this razor and that razor from a multitude of manufacturers.  I was provided this razor free through a promotion Gillette was running so I figured why not give this one a shot?  I&#x27;m glad I did because I&#x27;m quite impressed with the performance of this blade, EVERYTHING about it I feel is superior to every one I have tried at this point and the ONLY negative I see is the cost of replacement cartridges, that&#x27;s it.  Other than that, I would recommend this to anyone looking for that smooth, comfortable, and easy shave!  Hooah.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program sponsored by Gillette.  I have to say that this is one of the closest shaves I have ever gotten. I love Gillette and these blades did not disappoint, exactly what I&#x27;ve come to expect from them. I would recommend this to any one. I realize they are a little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I received the sample of the ProGlide from Gillette. When I first heard the ProGlide was coming out, I was a bit skeptical on how it could be that much better than the regular Fusion. As the result,I feel less drag when cutting the hairs and I hardly get bumps since I tried. The cartridge last pretty long. I usually shave every two or three days and its been almost a month and I haven&#x27;t changed it yet and they still work very well.</li>
    <li> i love these blades they work so well and they leave my skin so smooth after every use and it takes forever for the blades to ever go dull like other razors i used that went doll after the first use</li>
    <li> Thanks to a program that Gillette ran I was given a free Gillette Fusion Proglide to try and see what I think about it. All that I can say is that I love this razor. The new designed cartridges work like a charm, giving my a close and very smooth shave. I am one who uses only hot water when I shave and thanks to the lubricating strip I won the tug and pull battle that I was losing with my old blade. Thanks to the new design I was able to cut my shave time in half and keep that smooth face longer then I have ever had. Thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette fusion proglide  razor to try for free through a program run by Gillette.  The five blade cartridge gave me a very close shave and it made my skin feel soft. I really liked how it seemed to rinse the hair out of the cartridge unlike other cartridges I have tried in the past. This is a cartridge I will buy in the future.</li>
    <li> I am a Mach 3 guy.  It&#x27;s a simple, no frills razor that I&#x27;ve used for years.  My facial hair seems to grow in different directions so getting a completely smooth shave is just a pipe dream.  Overall, this razor is okay.  I didn&#x27;t experience a lot of resistance while shaving but overall, it irritated my face a little more than my Mach 3.  I do like the trimmer on the back of the razor, it&#x27;s a nice touch. I received the razor through a program ran by Gillette so while I appreciate it, I wouldn&#x27;t replace my old razor with it.</li>
    <li> I have always been skeptical of the \\&quot;more blades are better\\&quot; marketing angle that Gillette and the other big shaving brands have been pursuing over the past couple decades. You really have to wonder... where will it end? 5? 6? 7?... 15? Regardless, I was more than willing to give the Fusion ProGlide a fair shot when I received one for free through a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using dual blade disposables for several years and dealing with razor burn and acne issues on a daily basis, I started doing some research and eventually came upon the BiC Metal single blade razors, which I have been using for a couple years now (which are sadly the only razors on the market of their kind and are very hard to find in stores... Gillette should take note). Contrary to the marketing hype, the single blades cut just as easily as multi blade cartridges (and got closer), but without the clogging, pulling, and razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the ProGlide razor has only solidified my opinion. The first shave went well-- the razor handle has a solid, high quality feel and the blades cut well. One nice thing about the high razor count is that it&#x27;s harder to cut yourself. And for the morning, everything seemed fine. The next morning, however, I felt a sensation that had been so long I had almost forgotten... Yes, my razor burn was back, with vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that was it, back to the single blades for me. The redness and burning on my neck and the resulting breakouts have since subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice? Don&#x27;t fall for the multi-blade hype. Gillette should go back to the drawing board and create a high quality single-blade option. Sometimes less is more.</li>
    <li> So, I have some sensitive skin issues, and while shaving wise the Gillette Fusion ProGlide worked very well to shave, but I just think it was still a bit harsh on my skin, it felt a bit irritated after shaving and overall felt a bit big for my face. While it did the job well, I can&#x27;t say I loved the whole experience for my facial hair. As a gift to me from Gillette, I was very appreciative to test the Fusion ProGlide out, and maintain my loyalty to Gillette shaving products.</li>
    <li> I have to shave every day for my job, and my previous razor always irritated my neck when I would shave, especially after a long weekend when the hair would grow out. I received this razor from a free program run by Gillette and I now have no more irritation on my neck and my face is also much smoother. I would highly recommend this to anyone who shaves - either regularly or only occasionally. The blade on the back is also great for touch ups, which I use to keep my sideburns even, but I could see it also being useful if I was styling a beard.</li>
    <li> Gillette provided a free blade for my use. Having used Gillette blades before I really was not expecting any difference from my current blades. However, I was extremely surprised at the difference. It was noticeably smoother than any blade I have used previously. Having used the blade for several weeks now I can honestly say I am glad I was exposed to this blade and will be making the switch. I have no experience any downsides of the blade, it is an all around improvement over previous blades.</li>
    <li> Before I continue, just need to let you all know that I got to try these through a free promotion through Gillette, now then...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem with a lot of higher end razors, namely the fact that they are too big and my face is pretty small, so maneuvering them around gives me a hard time and i am often left with patches of hair on my face and have to pluck them or let my old \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; razors collect dust and use disposables which kills me because you really feel a difference with nicer razors, however, upon trying the proglide out, I have a much easier time. The razor head / blades are a lot smaller and really lets me glide the razor around and gets most, if not all my stray hairs. I also have been making great use of the detailer blade on the back of the razor for mustache hairs right under my nose and for taking care of my side burns. The detailer also really does a great job in getting rid of any single hairs that I may have missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly really enjoy this blade, I guess the only problem I have now is getting rid of the 10 remaining quattro cartridges I have lying around!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a special promotion from gillette. I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette fusion proglide for awhile now. I really like how close the shave is, I can go a lot longer without shaving. My wife says my face is smoother which is always important. The blades last a long time, I haven&#x27;t had to change mine yet! I also think for the price it&#x27;s worth it for a better product that last longer! I overall like the razor a lot and will definitely continue to use it. I also would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted me to write this review as we share this amazon account. These are his words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely like this razor, it is one of the best razors I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge free from a program that Gillette was having.  i thought it worked great, smooth shave, easy glide and left me feeling smooth and silky. I would recommend this razor to my friends.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003983HZK Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Cartridge 8 Count]]I was sent a free sample of the Gillette Fusion Proglide handle &amp; Cartidge to try and give my opinion about. I will tell you I was skeptical only because I tend to be a little that way by nature, and the times the way they are,anyway I agreed.I wil tell you when it arrived this thing is built,engineered to the highest quality,I was impressed! Not an easy task.Then I shaved with it. Oh I thought this is a dream ,perfect shave no cuts, no scrapes, no nicks.I thought well they are all good the first time,I thought we&#x27;ll see how it is in a week or two.Still three weeks now the moisture strip is faded and every thing and it is still out performing any razor I have ever tried before.So would I buy this? Yes! I don&#x27;t miss the chafing from the uneven shaves I was getting from the old Shick Hydro 5 I was using. Also I love the fact that the back of the cartridge has that blade for squaring up your sideburns and beard with one stroke it is gone.As a result I am Calling the Gillette Fusion Proglide the best on the market for this type of razor you can buy! Try it for yourself I think it will shock you too.</li>
    <li> I work where appearance is everything and being a manager means looking good and clean. I noticed sometimes by the end of my work day i wouldn&#x27;t be so clean shaven. Someone even made a comment that 5 oclock shadow is coming in i laughed but it actually was. A full 5 oclock shadow so gillette let me try there gillette fusion progride. Wow it works great i can be at work for more than 10 plus hours and still have a nice clean shave. Thats what is really important to me. Also no bumps after shaving on my skin which always happened because sometimes i shaved twice a day easily. I am very happy with this product and the blades that get in close to the skin and keeps me clean shaven all day.</li>
    <li> I have mostly positive things to say about the Gillette Fusion Proglide  Razor which I got for free from a program run by Gillette.It has a unique cartridge which has anticlogging rinse slots. The rinse slots allow you to clean the blades  better than before. Overall I love this razor. It gives you a close shave with no tugging or pulling. The only negative I can think of is the lubricating strip. Not sure that it helps too much.</li>
    <li> I only use Gillette products. I received the Gillette fusion proglide manual razor free through a promotion Gillette was doing. I really like the razor, it gives a nice close smooth shave without the razor burn of other razors. I have thick facial hair and to through razor refills often and with the fusion proglide manual razor I don&#x27;t think I will need refills as often. The razor is a good quality and so far is lasting longer than other razors.</li>
    <li> Top Notch again from Gillette!  An actual comfortable handle that won&#x27;t slip even when wet.  Firm grasp handle creates a smooth, steady shave!</li>
    <li> I was able to try this free thanks to a program Gillette had.  This cartridge felt like it was just gliding across my face. I didn&#x27;t have any of the pulling or tugging you normally have and not a bit of irritation. I had the closest shave I have ever had. The lubricating strip worked exceptionally well and felt great.  This is the only razor I want to use from now on.</li>
    <li> Having used the Schick quarto in the past I&#x27;ve been searching for smoothness. Boy did I find it in this razor.The Fusion Proglide truly glides very smoothly with the fifth VERY sharp blade. I will certainly buy this again!</li>
    <li> Happy Friday All,  I recently tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide and I must admit, I like it.  More importantly, the wife likes it!  She noticed my smooth face right away.  In addition to making the wife happy, Proglide&#x27;s thinner blades made it easier to rinse out the whiskers.  I hate it when I have to bang the razor on the side of the faucet several times to knock out the whiskers that are stuck between the blades.  You guys know what I am talking about!!  With Proglide those pesky whiskers just rinse right out.  To top it off, I love the handle&#x27;s grippy design!</li>
    <li> This worked good. Gave a good close shave. And good for my sensitive skin.it left no bumps or razor burn when I used them</li>
    <li> I received the razor provided via a program run by Gillette.  I have used the razor before and have been very happy with them.  I do not buy them very often because of the high cost but the razor itself gives a good shave that at least for my skin has the least amount of irritation of any razor I have tried.  If you can deal with the cost I think they are a great razor, they are just to expensive.</li>
    <li> The best manual razor available. I&#x27;ve always used the fusion blades and never had a problem with them except for a little razor burn. I was supplied with the proglide by a program run by Gillette. After two weeks of use I am very pleased with my shave. Goodbye razor burn.The lubrastrip is still intact. Unlike other razors after 5-6 shaves it is gone. The strip leaves my skin feeling so good and smooth. The Precision trimmer works great as well, perfect for those sensitive spots around the bottom of my nose and laying a clean line on my sideburns. I have found my new favorite razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can find is I have a hard time rinsing the hair out of the blades. That can be from my thick facial hair though, still gets a 5 out of 5 from me.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette. The razor did not perform as I thought it would, it was very hard to keep clean, I had to shave twice to get a close shave and the cartridge was hard to change out. I gave this product three out of five stars.</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor via a program through Gillette and when I used this it I was very pleased with the quality of the shave. It provided a very close shave and even though I have fairly sensitive skin it did not irritate my face at all. The only issue was that the refills were a little expensive but for the most part it is worth the price</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor was provided to me for free by a program run by Gillette.  The catridge gave me a very close shave and I was very impressed with how well it worked.  However, I have also had as good a shave from some other razors that are less expensive than this razor.  I definitely think that if you are not totally satisifed with your current razor you should give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Not bad I guess but I&#x27;ll stick with using razors with larger  moisturizing strips on the plus side the little trim edge was nice.</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;d like to state that I got my Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor through a program Gillette was running for free. Before getting this razor, I&#x27;d only shaved like once and it was the most painful, bloody experience I&#x27;d ever had. The razor kept nicking me and I had a ton of razor bumps by the end of the experience. But with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge my skin was never once nicked and I had 0 razor bumps by the end of the experience. I like the fact that the razor is light weight and has a neat grip which makes it easier to glide the blades across your face. It provides a very close even shave and the cartridges last for a long time. My only quip is that the cartridges are pretty pricey but it well worth it as they last for a long time as I stated before.</li>
    <li> These razors really are great. They give me a great wet shave but I also use them dry to touch up my sideburns and neckline. These are probably the best I&#x27;ve used to date. Gillette provided the razor through a program they offer so I could try it out and give an honest opinion. I truly believe this is a great product and I will continue to purchase them for personal use.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor for FREE via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;As I have been shaving for 25 years since retiring from the Grizzly Addams look.&lt;br /&gt;This has to be in the top two of all the impliments I have tried over the years.&lt;br /&gt;The top mounted blade for trimming, I rarely use, as the primary blades do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;The best design idea has been with the ease of water rinsing through the cutting head.&lt;br /&gt;(Better than the Quattro)&lt;br /&gt;I seem to get about 18-20 days on a cartridge.</li>
    <li> Gillette has proven to me once again that they are one of the top brands in mens products. I received the Progilde as part of Gillette program and was excited to try it out. I am not naturally a very hairy person, and because of this I have had many blades in the past leave me with burn marks or tender areas. Thankfully this was not the case with this blade. I was surprised how close to my skin it would cut the hair without leaving any marks on me. The fact that it swivels helped shave more difficult areas. So far I&#x27;ve used this product without shaving cream and it has not disappointed me. If i were to have one compliant it would be that it does not handle lots of hair at one time very well. Overall i recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a clean shave and doesn&#x27;t like using electric razors or mainly shaves in the shower.</li>
    <li> After recieving new Gillette Fusion Proglide through a campaign from Gillette, I noticed something different. After four days I was still using the same blade cartridge and I wasnt getting the usual razor burn. I was doing the same thing I usually do, rinse the blades, towel dry them and I&#x27;m ready for the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I went and picked up another cartridge, the price seemed alittle high but not when you divide out how many days one cartridge last. So after three weeks this is one item I am not giving up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it once and I am betting you will agree with me that the new Gillette Fusion Proglide blades are more than worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use this blade for the weekly trimming around my beard and goatee when needed. Since I do not shave regularly I get skin redness when I do. i have noticed that this blade does not bother my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I have used previous proglide razors in the past, but these new blades are truly different. I have used the razors, experimenting, dry and wet shaving, use after use and they have held up beautifully. I have a very diverse background for ethnicity so my hair is thick and hard to shave. I have grown trusting to one particular brand (Throw aways) but these new blades have opened my eyes.</li>
    <li> I recently recieved a free Fusion Proglide Manual Razor from Gillette (handle and cartridge) as part of a free program by Gillette to review, and evaluate the razor. I have to say that this razor and handle is by far the most comfortable razors I have used. From handle to cartridge the razor feels like it was designed to just fit naturally in my hand. The handle has a nice weight and being that this weight is in the handle, it keeps the center of gravity low making the razor pretty much a much closer shave. The padded handle is a definite a plus as well, especially when your hands are wet as it allows you to keep the razor in your hand, and as I mentioned earlier, its just darn comfortable. I definitely would recommend this razor to anyone who wants to use one of the most comfortable razor&#x27;s on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con to this razor is it&#x27;s price. It&#x27;s a great product, just a little pricey for my taste. Other then that, I have absolutely enjoyed using it!</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide . I must say that it has one of the best razor cartridges I have ever used. It is so easy to clean, and gives a VERY close shave! I would highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razors to anyone!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free through a program run by Gillette.  This is by far the best blade I&#x27;ve used in my life.  The mere fact that I can put the blade to my face wrecklessly and not even have to worry about nicking myself is enough to convince me.  There is nothing worse than cutting your face while shaving, even when I paid super close attention with both the Mach3 and Sensor Excel, I would still find a way to cut myself once every 4 or 5 shaves.  With this blade, I literally slam it to my face with no regard or worry for cutting myself, and it smoothly traverses my face.  The shave itself is as good as any I have ever had with a hand held blade.  I only shave about twice a week, but the blade stays fresh between shaves.  The cartridge is super easy to load and unload, via a button towards the top of the handle, it snaps right in and comes out without any effort or worry.  I would recommend this blade to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> I do need to shave on a regular basis due to my Job. My skin is sensitive if it comes to Razors so I only trust what I know.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I have been awarded with a Free Razor from a Program run by Gillette and had the chance to try the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cartridge has a Lubricant Stripe that should make your skin softer. Should, because I do not feel any difference at all. Using Shaving Cream must be a Killer for the Stripe. It only lasted a couple shaves and according to Gillette if it turns white it means you need to change the Blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cartridge itself has 5 thin Blades and a Precision Trimmer. Even shaving against the grain is no problem for the Blades. My Skin is not irritated at all after the shave. The Quality overall is really good, I believe that this will be my Travel Razor for the upcoming time.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades are sharp and are plentiful. After experiencing the effectiveness of the five main blades for about ten shaves, my chin still feels smooth and without irritation. Shaving takes a little less time than it did with a three-bladed manual razor so I must say that the blades that get the job done quicker is always the winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the back of the razor is the precision trimmer blade, which I use for stubborn hairs in hard-to-reach spots and I also use them to trim my sideburns. It works well on my sideburns as long as you work on a small area at a time, and it leaves my face smooth and looks like it was professionally trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my blade for free as part of a program Gillette is running, so I can&#x27;t speak to the cost effectiveness of the blades, but if this one blade lasts for another several good shaves, it should be worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This free razor cartridge was provided free of charge by a program run by Gillette.  I think the cartridge of this blade is above average, though, it has some flaws.  The blade has a very nice this design to it that makes it feel like you&#x27;re gliding along your face.  I thought that the shave was very smooth; I would give it a 5 star for the shave quality.  My understanding is the Gillette team improved the blade for longer hair, but my recommendation is that you use this blade for shorter hairs so that it won&#x27;t become stuck because it&#x27;s a very minor improvement from the original Fusion.  Personally, I don&#x27;t have too much of a problem with it.  There were some spots on my face where the hair pulled, but that was minor.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend, and I would spend extra money to buy the new Proglide cartridges over the regular Fusion ones.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave easy to use. I really liked the shape and feel to this razor. No razor burn or bumps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying these are great blades.  I received a promotional kit from Gillette to try these out, and I&#x27;m happy with the results they achieve.  I have a thick beard, and they do a great job of giving me a clean shave without a lot of irritation.  Most disposable razors don&#x27;t come close to the quality of shave one can achieve with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the price is a little overwhelming.  The blades don&#x27;t seem to last that much longer than the cheaper disposables (I might get an extra week worth of shaving from them if I&#x27;m lucky).  For the price, I would hope to get a little more life out of them.  I care for them by rinsing frequently during shaving, and cleaning the blades with alcohol afterwards. For me, this razor is best suited for on the road/travel purposes.  At home, I don&#x27;t think you can beat the effectiveness/cost of using a safety razor and decent blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford the added cost of the blades, you can&#x27;t go wrong the ProGlide.  It&#x27;s by far the best cartridge razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this new blade. I got it from Gillette for free from a program they run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try not to shave my beard, but I thought why not for the summer. This blade does what it says and glides across the face. It was a quick and effortless shave that left me in practically no pain(razor bumps). I would definitely recommend this blade to anyone.</li>
    <li> It shaves good for the first five times. The blades became dull after a week. The handle has a nice feel though</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor free to try out through a program with the company, and I have to say I would really like to purchase it again. I have to shave my face every single morning for work, and the ProGlide razor did the best job of any razor I&#x27;ve found so far at not irritating my skin. That being said, the razors and the refill cartridges seem a bit pricey. I would absolutely buy the product again, but if I found a similar razor for a more competitive price I would definitely choose the other razor. I go through razors too quickly to be able to afford four dollars a cartridge.</li>
    <li> I have used the various 5-blade versions of the Fusion razor cartridge for years and they are all pretty good.  Recently Gillette asked me to evaluate this newest Fusion razor and I found it to be just as good as all the others- easy to  use, well-built and simple to clean.  I find that I can get 3-5 uses from each cartridge before the blades are too dull for a sharp cut.  I still have some concerns that 5 blades actually cut the the hair so short that the tip of the whisker lies beneath the surface of the follicle and can result in ingrown hairs... but this can be avoided with a good shaving lather which prevents the blades from pulling the hair out before the cut.  I like Fusion and generally recommend it to anyone who cannot get a straight-razor shave every day :-)</li>
    <li> This razor is grat shaves smooth last longer than any other just wish it was a little cheaper overall it is an amazing razor.</li>
    <li> I love these razors! They work great, next to no pull or drag and I would notice, I&#x27;ve used them to shave my head. Other razors left my head with razor bumps and burn, not these. Gillette is also a great company, I received these for free through a promotion they were running. The only downside to these blades is the precision trimmer, I wish it was sharper and more aggressive. Really great blades overall.</li>
    <li> I recently got to try these blades out via a free-program run by Gilette, and I musty say, these aren&#x27;t my favorite blades I&#x27;ve experienced. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think they are good blades, and far better than blades you can get from other brands (I think it may be more than a coincidence that bic rhymes with ick), but these blades leave me with slight razor burn, and I catch myself having to \\&quot;go over\\&quot; some spots where the blade got overwhelmed. This isn&#x27;t a huge problem, and I&#x27;m used to it, due to my coarse hair, but I personally think that the ProGlide Power Blades are better. (I would spend the extra money to move away from the manual razor, just for the blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also particularly fond of the fusion blades because of the indicator strip, to tell you when blades are getting worn. I think that a lot of bad shaves come from some worn out razors, and with the ProGlide razors not coming with an indicator strip, I think that&#x27;s a big problem. Frankly, if your sticking to a manual razor, I wouldn&#x27;t move away from the fusion.</li>
    <li> I recently got the chance to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge through a program run by Gillette. I was impressed with the closeness of the shave and pleased that the shave left no bumps or nicks on my skin afterwards. I am giving it five stars because it is the best blade I have ever used. I am very happy with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge!</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a program run by Gillette. The blades are awesome. I get a really close clean shave. Best blades ever!</li>
    <li> I recently started using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razors (which were provided through a program run by Gillette) for about a month now, and I think they give a wonderful shave! I was still using the Gillette Mach3 and these razors are a definite upgrade. The blade runs very smoothly over your face and I usually only have to go over an area once for a close shave. Best of all, I didn&#x27;t get any nicks using this product. I will definitely use this again!</li>
    <li> when i bought this product i was expecting the regular cuts and what nots. once i used the blades, then i found out that my sensitive skin was not bleeding nor hurting .</li>
    <li> Having been using these cartridges for the last few weeks after receiving them free via a Gillette-run program, my thoughts on them are quite simple. Yes, they&#x27;re a bit on the pricier side, but they&#x27;ve also been providing me an incredibly smooth shave so long as my facial hair isn&#x27;t allowed to grow out too thick. The single blade on the reverse is a nice idea in theory, but in practice I&#x27;ve never used it. For minor trimming of that nature, you&#x27;re better off using a dedicated clipper.</li>
    <li> Excellent razors for a smooth shave. Excellent for sensitive skin. Very comfortable to handle en difficult areas. They arrive early !</li>
    <li> Glad I got to try this razor. It give a close shave and even my wife loves to use it. My from now own razor</li>
    <li> I was given the razor as a promotion from Gillette.  I only gave it 4 stars because I do not personally like razor heads that pivot. I feel that with pivoting heads I can not get into some of the hard to reach areas by my nose. I have thick facial hair and was impressed that the hairs did not get trapped in the blades like it does with just about every other kind of razor. It gave me a very smooth shave and was overall pleased with the results. I would say I shave about every other day and the blade has been going strong for about 4 weeks. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a smooth shave that lasts for days. The blades are amazing and gentle but really work well.  The handle fits perfectly in your hand too. Overall I highly recommend this razor. I have really sensitive skin and this razor works the best that I have found.</li>
    <li> Razor cuts really cleanly and stays sharp for a good duration. I found it works better after a shower versus using just using shaving cream. Cuts really cleanly and effortlessly. Don&#x27;t need to apply much pressure at all. More is actually better when it comes to these cartridges. The single, lone \\&quot;precision trimmer\\&quot; blade I find really useful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer these over my DollarShaveClub razors as they don&#x27;t dull as fast and cut closer.</li>
    <li> I am a Gillette fan and regular user of the Mach 3 disposable razor.  I recently used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor from a promotion by Gillette and I&#x27;m a fan of that razor too.  I had a thick beard the first time that I used the razor and it took care of it with no problems.  No pulling on the face and the hair didn&#x27;t bunch up in the blade as much as it does with the Mach 3.  I&#x27;m still using the same blade a month later and it is holding up great.  I still get a smooth shave every time, even though the lotion strip is almost gone.  I&#x27;m also a fan of the edging blade for my sideburns, under the nose, and neck line.  It is an easier tool than trying to move my face so that the razor will get all the spots I need to shave or to even have to try and take the flex out of the blade as it shaves.  Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this razor and would recommend it others that are looking for a good shave.</li>
    <li> I love this product! As far as non-electric razors go, it by far produces the best shave. I&#x27;ve used all sorts of blades, from 1 to 5, and this is the smoothest one yet. I got the razor through a free program by gillette, adnd I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> The 5 blades offer a smoother shaving experience than the 3 blade cartridges I was using previously on a manual razor. I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference in the actual closeness of the shave though. It has a single blade on the back designed for precision trimming of sideburns, which I tried, but don&#x27;t personally see much use for it. If I could buy cartridges at a lower price that didn&#x27;t have that, I would.</li>
    <li> I was given one free Gillette Fusion Proglide by a program run by Gillette. I usually use disposable razors, and this is a vast improvement. The blades give a close and smooth shave. I noticed that the five blades on this razor give me no razor bumps compared to the three on my other razor. The cartridges are a little pricey, but the blades are noticeably higher quality than disposable razors. The blades on this razor also don&#x27;t get dull with about a month of use, and I could give it another few weeks. The trimmer blade in the back is also great.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from a program sponsored by Gillette. I have a sensitive neck and it seems like the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cuts me less than other razors. I did have to go back over it a few times to get all the hair in some spots. The single razor on the back is good for smaller spots since the front of it is rather large.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the gillette proglide for over a week now and I must say I&#x27;m impressed how the blades continue to stay as sharp as they were when i first used it. Blades that I&#x27;ve used in the past would lose their sharpness after a couple uses. The shave is very comfortable. I&#x27;m thankful gillette provided this to me for free as it has opened up my eyes that real durable blades exist.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette for free. This razor is amazing, the handle is comfortable in your hands are the blades are amazing. They provide for a close shave without the irritation or pull that other razors seem to have accompanied with them. They feel great, and you can bet they last for a few shaves. However, the downfall with these is the PRICE. Other companies seem to offer better priced items, for near the quality. I can&#x27;t justify spending over double the amount than dollar shave club on a blade that is only a little better. Sad to say; I do love the blades, just wish the price wasnt as steep.</li>
    <li> I usually dont shave. Being a young, black man, my face was prone to razor bumps after using many different disposable razors. I&#x27;ve even tried using an older model Gillette razor in the past, and my face still became a canvas of bumps. I eventually settled on electric trimmers to \\&quot;shave.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette was kind enough to offer me a sample Fusion ProGlide razor, and I&#x27;ve been satisfied after using it for the last week. I was very hesitant to try another razor in fear of damaging my skin again. I figured I&#x27;d test their 5 blade system and see how close of a shave I can get. Surprisingly, I found myself having to only go over each area of my face once. Previously, those little disposable razors were only barely making contact with my beard.&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of shaving and using sensitive skin shaving balm, I&#x27;ve had a clean look without the bumps!&lt;br /&gt;The ProGlide cartridge is a flexible piece that moves along the curves of your face, which is especially helpful when going for the mustache. Gillette designers really put some time and thought into the mechanics of the cartridges. Silent, smooth, and easy to replace. Just press the button above the handle, and it pops off easily. Be careful: the cartridge pops out quickly, so make sure to hold it when your ejecting it.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I had a pleasant experience with this razor. I hope that it lasts me a long time, because I&#x27;m going back to shaving. Thank you Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-Flexible cartridge&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to remove and replace&lt;br /&gt;-Great design&lt;br /&gt;-5 blades results in very close shave&lt;br /&gt;-No bumps or irritation after shaving&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-Cartridge goes flying of you&#x27;re not holding when ejecting it</li>
    <li> Closest shave I ever had without getting the burn. Love it! My wife steals it from me all the time too.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor as part of a program run by Gillette. I was impressed with the quality of the blade and it&#x27;s smooth operation. There was no noticeable tug during the shave and no razor burn after the shave. The only thing I would recommend would be a protective cover for the blade when not in use. I&#x27;m a little nervous reaching into the drawer knowing there is an open blade in it somewhere.</li>
    <li> I got this for free as a promotion from gillette. THe razors are great. This leaves my skin feeling soft and clean shaved. I dont get any razor burns and you can really feel the razor working. I would recomend this</li>
    <li> I love how this razor shaves close to the skin and leaves my skin feeling smooth .The best part is it left no razor burn so my skin felt great !</li>
    <li> I received this razor and cartridges through a program run by Gillette. These blades are great! They provide a smooth, close, comfortable shave!</li>
    <li> I had been growing my facial hair for about a week and, when it came time to shave, I chose to use the Gillete Fusion Proglide.  It was a very smooth shave and was definitely a step up from the razors I was using previously.</li>
    <li> I got this razor through a campaign ran by Gillette. Before this I used a Schick Quattro. The Schick worked good. But I made sure I didnt shave for over a week before my Pro-Glide came in. I have never had a smoother shave before. It amazed me how easily it took out that long week old stubble on my face. The razor also was very easy to clean. The hair didnt get stuck in it all the time like with my old razor. All in all, it is my new razor and the Schick is now in the trash. My nephew was impressed with it too and went out and bought himself one as well.</li>
    <li> What does it take for me to have a great shave? The Fusion ProGlide gives a close shave without the pulling and irritation of other shavers I&#x27;ve tried. Gillette supplied the free razor I&#x27;ve been using and I&#x27;m so glad they did. Razors have always been a necessary evil to me and seldom came close to their claims. I used to wonder if my beard was somehow unusually tough as I cringed during shaving with razor after razor. This cartridge is different. The multiple blades are the thinnest I&#x27;ve used and cause the least pull ever. When combined with the cartridge&#x27;s lubrication strip, I can have a shave that is both truly close and truly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned with the width of the five-blade cartridge at first. It doesn&#x27;t appear maneuverable. Once I started using it, I quickly adapted to the feel. The pivoting head followed my facial contours faithfully. The ProGlide cartridge is a tight fit under the nose. However, the trimmer on the back of the cartridge will not only clean up your side burns, it will clean up the upper lip as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;d like improved is how long the lubrication strip lasts. The lubrication provided is superior but, although the blades are still good after 5 shaves, the strip is used up.</li>
    <li> I have to say I have used many razors over the years from the single blade all the way up to this 5 blade razors and I have finally found the blades that actually perform how they promise to. These blades are great I no longer have to worry about having a slight shadow or get nicks or cuts when shaving. These are the only blades that I have found that give me the closest shave while keeping my face smooth with soft feel, and when I rub my hands over my face after shaving with these blades my face is silky smooth and not irritation like I get from other blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive the free razor from a program run by Gillette and I am thankful that I got to try it and now after using it a few times I wonder why I did not use it sooner. I know I thought the price of the blades would be too high when I could just get a disposable but now I realize their is no real comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to look and feel your best you have to try these blades, I know I will never go back to the old blades again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review will help anyone who is debating on getting the blades, like I was. Because, if you want to look and feel your best you will not be disappointed with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor and Blades.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Razor from Gillette  to try for free.  I do not shave with a razor blade, I prefer to use an electric shaver. However after using this product I am quite surprised how much I enjoyed it. The blades were very smooth on my skin and trimmed my beard with ease. I stopped shaving with these kind of razors because I would always get little nicks. This didn&#x27;t happen with the razor at all. I am definitely going to continue using this!!</li>
    <li> I had a chance to use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Cartridge after I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette. I currently have a beard that grows heavily on the neck which I use trimmers or scissors on and I use a razor on the neck and face to keep my beard in line and to also shave the mustache and chin stubble. The razor worked great on my cheeks and mustache, leaving a smooth face with no bumps or redness, the added lubricant strip worked well with my normal shaving cream to provide a smooth shave. The only con is that I have coarse beard hair and on the neck line it tugged and pulled a few hairs here and there but not  anymore than any other razor I have used. Overall, Gillette Fusion ProGlide will be my next choice at the store.</li>
    <li> Got the razor free from Gillette to try it out. Best Blades ever this is the best blades I have ever used they are a little expensive but are worth it.</li>
    <li> The Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide(tm) Power Razor is Gillette&#x27;s most advanced blade ever. Thinner, finer blades* with a low-resistance coating glide effortlessly through hair for less tug and pull**, providing incredible comfort, even if you shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MicroComb*, found exclusively on the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor, guides stubble while thinner, finer blades** cut close comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the last version for almost ten years and with this new one I was quite skeptical at this 5-blade monstrosity when I first saw it. I was happy when I shaved my head, and usually use a DE razor for my face, but I think I just bought this out of curiosity. Well, several months later I&#x27;m still using it regularly, despite the extra cost of the cartridges. It really does give a smooth and comfortable shave, even when in a rush (which is just about every morning) I switched back to using my M3 for a couple of days and couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
    <li> Seem to work well, not as good as genuine cartridges with the green aloe strip.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have to be very picky with my shaving products. As much as I&#x27;d like to save money and go with cheap disposable razors, I&#x27;d look like I&#x27;d been laying out in the sun for a week straight. The Fusion Proglide cartridges, which I received through a Gillette program, give a nice, close shave with a minimum of discomfort. They do seem to wear down a little quickly (I shave every other day), which is why I give them 4 stars instead of 5, but compared to what&#x27;s out there, they&#x27;re the best that I&#x27;ve used for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> amazing razor! water doesnt make it slippery! and the single blade on the top of the blades is in the perfect spot, i was a little worried it would get in the way and i would cut myself forgetting it was there, but thats not a problem at all!</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve been sailing the seas for a decent razor blade for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking I would be stuck in the 2 week life cycle of buy a crappy razor, change the blade in two weeks, rinse &amp; repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I saw the light on the shore and found the proglide series of razors. Man are these things smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where as before with my cheap razors, I would hardly even attempt to shave cross-grain (yes I have senstive skin) and going against the grain was out of the picture. Now with the proglide I can go cross-grain and against the grain without having to worry about any irrittion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are durable too, I&#x27;ve been using the same blade now for almost a month and this thing hasn&#x27;t lost any of it&#x27;s sharpness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down if you have sensitive skin and need something you feel comfortable with, try the proglide series. It&#x27;ll be well worth diving into.</li>
    <li> I reeived this razor as part of a program run by Gillette. I am used to having to rinse the blades after every swipe or two due to clogging. These blades did not clog!! I am very surprised to experience this. In all my years of shaving, I have never had a razor blades that didn&#x27;t clog. I thought it was due to my coarse facial hair, but Gillette Proglide got the job done. I got a close smooth shave with no nicks! It took less time than usual as well.</li>
    <li> when I received the Gillette pro glide is was skeptical. then I tried it. wow what a difference of the closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;from early morning the shave was with out cuts and red rash and it was an excellent razor. keep up the good work- I really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide as a promotional item in the mail. I had seen the razor in the store but never actually bought it. I give it a try and loved it. I am the type of person that has to shave everyday, and with this razor it really gave me that close shave that I was looking for. Overall it&#x27;s a great product and I have really enjoyed it and will be getting the replacement cartridges in the future.</li>
    <li> I got the chance to try the  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual cartridges free as part of a program run by Gillette. I Was highly impressed with the job the razor did. I had no breakouts or razor burn after using these razor blades, and it was quick to the point and no having to having to shave the same place multiple times. I give the Gillete Fusion Blades 2 thumbs up and would deffinitly recommend them to others!!!</li>
    <li> Gillette fusion proglide provides a smooth clean shave without the razor burn. I have used the same brand razor for years so was a bit skeptikal at first. I was really surprised with how much I like this razor.</li>
    <li> Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Proflide cartridge is one of the best I have tried. They are a little on the pricey side, but they are worth the price. The blades get close without cutting up my skin. I love that there is a single trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge. Also, the blades are very easy to clean. Nothing worse than a razor that you cannot get the hair off the cartridge. I highly recommend this product to all men.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about the new razor, but when a free program (run by Gillette) came across my desk ... I couldn&#x27;t say no (and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t)! I was quite amazed by this razor and not to mention shaving took less time. I would have only been halfway done with my shave with my old razor, but with the Fusion ProGlide, it took less time for an even better (smoother) shave!</li>
    <li> I was not a fan of more blades is better but I tried one of these and was impressed with the shave.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a special promotion from Gillette and this is what I found after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this refillable razor to be excellent in a number of ways, from the handle right down to the lubricative strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is sturdy, has a nice weight to help keep the blades in contact with your face and helps to effortlessly glide the multiple blades through the thickest stubble. The single trimmer blade makes trimming places like side burns and under the nose a snap. The multiple blades shave you close without tugging of pulling and are gentle on even sensitive skin. The lubricative strip is long lasting and makes shaving a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;for my money this is the only refillable manual razor I would use. Engineered by men, for men.</li>
    <li> Things I love about this razor besides the great shave:&lt;br /&gt;5. Ease of blade replacement&lt;br /&gt;4. Love the grip, there is no way this razor is ever going to slip out of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;3. I don&#x27;t have to repeatedly go over the same spot&lt;br /&gt;2. Handles three to four day stubble like a champ&lt;br /&gt;1. I love the fact that this blade doesn&#x27;t clog with hair: let me explain this point just a little.  There is many a weekend, in which I do not have to go to work and so am not required to shave.  So come Monday morning when I am trying to shave off two or three days of stubble my razor gets clogged on the first pass and no amount of running water or swishing in a sink bowl will clean it out.  Once the razor is clogged, it is like shaving with sand paper.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide does not have that problem, if you look you will see that it is still clean after a complete shave.  I love this razor!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  It was provided to me by Gillette to review.  I am very happy with it.  It has a nice close shave and I have not had any problems with scrapes or cuts.  I had been using an electric razor and this it better for me then that.  I will continue to use this instead of the electric one.  I know there are many on the market but this ranks up there with the best. I for one need a good shave every day and it is great to get a good shave so easily.  Also the blades are not getting dull quickly so this is going to last for a while which is great.  I feel this is a good product. This was provided for free to me for being a BzzAgent.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> When I first used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor, it cut right through the hair with the first swipe (my facial hair is pretty thick). I occasionally use a straight razor and the razors on the Fusion ProGlide were equally as sharp.The razor was provided via a program run by Gillette and I am very humbled to get to try it. To be completely honest, I rarely use the single &#x27;sculpting&#x27; blade, as when I shave, I don&#x27;t got for any styling. But the single blade was useful to get those hard to get stray hairs. Overall the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor is a great hassle free everyday razor that I would recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle on the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor is great. It feels good in the hand, provides great grip so you don&#x27;t feel like the razor is going to slip out of your hand when shaving (which could end badly if it did). The handle also feels very sturdy and solid, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it will fall apart. One of my favorite characteristics to the razor handle is that it has a good weight to it, to me it conveys a sense of quality in the product and makes me feel more confident while using it.</li>
    <li> I received this nifty product free via a Gillette program. If you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;ve tried disposable generic brand razors, you probably got an irritated chin and looked like it journeyed through Mordor. This razor is sturdy and leaves a clean, close shave that feels great. I highly recommend this product. As Gandalf would say, \\&quot;There is only one Razor, only one who can bend it to his will. And he does not share power.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Last Christmas I recieved a Schick razor with 5 blades,I was excited because i had alway used store brand disposable razors and they left my face feeling rough and rashy. Unfortunatly the Schick did NOT do much better, in fact it was so big and bulky i had to use a cheap razor to shave under my giant nose. About a month ago i recieved the Gillette Fusion Proglide, i had my reservations about using another five blade razor but, it was free so i figured it would not kill me to try it. When i took it out of the box i was surprised at how futuristic it looks and thought it was a bit overkill but when i actually used  it i realized that the design of the handle actually made shaving easier. The blades on the Gillette are also much thinner than the other brand i used which made it way easier to get that annoying spot under my schnoz. With this razor I am able to shave against the grain and still have a smooth non irritated face, deffinitely deserves five stars.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge free through a program run by Gillette. These blades give a very close shave, but for some reason it pulled my facial hair. If I could have that close of a shave without the pulling of the facial hair, it would be a great razor and worth the somewhat expensive price. I also liked how the precision trimmer helped me to make my sideburns even and shave the hair right above my lip.</li>
    <li> So, I got this product for free through a promotion that Gillette was doing and I have to say I would have paid for it had I known how great of a shave it gives! I&#x27;ll start off by saying, I don&#x27;t shave every day. Maybe once every week and a half (mainly because I am lazy), but it was a relief to my face once I got this razor. I was your usual user of disposable razors that hurt even if they were brand new, but once switching to the Gillette Fusion Proglide, I am not sure I would ever go back. I have been using mine for almost two months now and I have seen no reduction in performance. I am hoping I can get 6-8 months of use out of this before I need to change, which would actually be comparable to the costs of the disposable razors. Again, I can not say how well this works for someone who shaves every day, but for the man who shaves weekly, this is a solid product!</li>
    <li> Completely love this shave. I had horribly problems with reaching the hard places and getting rid of my razor burn. I was surprised to find that this razor fixes both. Sure it&#x27;s a little more expensive than some razors but a few dollars for a great shave is a small price to pay. Recommend!</li>
    <li> After receiving these blades to try through a program ran by Gillette, I will not buy them again.  I had so many nicks and cuts that I actually had to go back to my cheap disposable razor, after going over my face 3 more times. --TylerM2013</li>
    <li> Although the refills are a bit pricey, I love this razor.  Its the closest shave that ive gotten from a manual razor.</li>
    <li> Definitely, a lot has gone into the design of this cartridge- research, testing, improvements and reiteration. A time-tested technology that probably came up with the original Mach razor has missed the target according to me. The problem with this cartridge is that its five blades are just too many to do justice to the face. People, who have used a single blade professional razor would agree that nothing can give a closer shave. The five blades in this system are just too many and leave my skin a little itchy. The other problem with this system is that it is supposed to last much longer than a normal razor. Although the Gillette website doesn&#x27;t provide any information on how many shaves this cartridge must last, I suppose it should last at least 10-15 shaves. However, as soon as the lubricant strip wears out, the shave is not comfortable any more. Having said that, the cartridge is not without its merits. The idea of having a blade on the top for trimming the sideburns is definitely awesome. Yet, I will stick to the previous version of Gillette- the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;PS: Gillette had graciously provided me with a free test sample of the Fusion</li>
    <li> This free razor cartridge provided by Gillette performed to all of my expectations.  It left me with a clean, smooth shave and left me WITHOUT a single nick or razor burn.  The cartridge glided freely over my face by using nothing but hot water as a lubricant.  My face felt babier smooth than it has after many trials with less comparable disposable razors.  I was very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone searching for an alternative to their current razor.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor out for that close shave! If you want no facial hair or just a mustache this product is for you for sure. I got this item for free to try via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> Hey folks, I don&#x27;t know about you, but I am an avid shaver. (have been since about age 17) Throughout my shaving \\&quot;career\\&quot; (20+ yrs.) I have had my &#x27;not-so-close&#x27; encounters more often than I care to admit. I lucked on to a test drive (if you will) of some Gillette Fusion Proglide cartridges via a program run by Gillette. SCORE!!! These blades are Awesome! They glide over my face effortlessly &amp; provide me with one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever encountered! These blades remain sharp after multiple uses. (I just returned from a 14 day Vacation &amp; I only packed one cartridge!!!)</li>
    <li> I have used many razors in search for the one that will finally eliminate my razor burn under my jaw line. No matter what I use it always happens. Finally, thanks to a program that Gillette hosted I received the Fusion ProGlide for free! For the first time since I can remember I shaved without razor burn under my chin! No more bumps! Couple that with the convenience of the extra single blade on the top of the cartridge and you have a product that beats the rest. No more embarrassing bumps and missed spots under my nose. I would recommend this product for anyone. One thing is for sure, I am a customer!</li>
    <li> I received this shaver as a gift from gillette in a promotion. I need to shave almost every day, and this shaver makes it so much easier. It gives you a great shave, close,  and, because it has a back blade, also, it does a great job helping to give you a neat line when trimming. Its very portable and easy to clean, love the gripped handle. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have never had a razor that could give me a smooth shave without irritating my skin (at least not after using it for a few days) this razor keeps giving me a smooth 2 weeks in. No irritation and my wife loves how close the razor gets. I was skeptical that it would be any better than my fusion but it has it beat by a mile.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be chosen by Gillette to try their Fusion ProGlide and I was very impressed with the cartridge. I currently have a full beard, but I do have to use a razor to trim my cheeks, under my chin and my neck about 4 times per week. I was impressed by the lubrastrip, as I usually notice pulling on my neck and there was none with this razor, even after several shaves. The shave was very close and felt smooth for a day or more. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and the cartridge is still going strong, although the lubrastrip has been used up. I will absolutely purchase the replacement Fusion ProGlide cartridges.</li>
    <li> Ive used about every style and brand of razor out there but im in love with Gillette. They just keep getting better and better. The proglide was provided by me courtesy of BzzAgent and Gillette.  The proglide is perfection, it glides over even the roughest of spots with ease and doesnt leave me with any kind of razor burn like poorly made razors do. THANKS GILLETTE FOR MAKING AN AWESOME PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This razor system is awesome. Ergonomic and practical. I have used the fusion for many years and have just switched to the proglide. It leaves a clean shave and is easy to use. The only issue is the price.</li>
    <li> I was in Army Basic when I first started to use the ProGlide.  Every day my face was smooth and I never looked like I need a shave.  One day my drill sergeant asked me how often i shaved, I told him every day.  He thought I did not grow hair.  My drill Sergeant made everyone in the platoon purchase this brand razor.  They are not the cheapest Razor but not having razor burn is so worth it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the best shavers that I have used.  It provides a very smooth shave, the handle is sturdy and provides a good grip, and there are no razor burns when shaving with the Fusion Proglide.  I felt the difference immediately during my first use.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a complementary program by Gillette and have enjoyed it so far. This is one of the smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve had. Practically no irritation, practically no razor burn even when shaving my neck. Would I buy it myself? Maybe. The razor is fantastic, the price is a bit more than I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide provided by Gillette,  and  I was pleasantly surprised at how close this razor shaved without any discomfort or pulling.  It&#x27;s a superb razor with makes you feel a comfortable, luxurious shave but I will say the replacement cartridges are pretty expensive.  But aside from that, this is a pretty nice razor with many advantages that other cheaper models do not deliver.  Again though the price of the replacement blades might not be ideal for some.  I also want to add that the handle has a comfortable feel, nice grip, right weight.</li>
    <li> recieved the  razor and blades from gillette  loved the  shave  def worth the price  got a new brand of razor now  for me</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide razors are a bit pricey but I would recommend them to anyone. They give a great close shave &amp; the blades don&#x27;t get dull as quickly as most razors I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> As with any manual razor I worry about rash and burning but with the proglide I get VERY little of either. I&#x27;ve had issues with rash, redness and burning since I started shaving even with electric razors. The proglide cartridges nearly eliminates this. To be honest I only tried it because I got a free sample from Gillette and I will be using it from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was one issue I had with it, and that is why it got four instead of five stars, and that is rinsing hair from the blades. I don&#x27;t know if it is the thickness of my facial hair or what. Other than that I couldn&#x27;t find a single problem with the Proglide.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well, made for an extremely smooth shave. I hate razor burns and after shaving there was not a single one! Definitely a product worth trying and using forever.</li>
    <li> These razors glide across the face with ease and no pulling.  The only downside I can say about them is that my wife won&#x27;t let me just have my own razor.  She loves the way it provides a smooth and as she says \\&quot;ouch-less\\&quot; experience for her legs.  CAUTION: don&#x27;t let your wife get ahold of your razor unless you don&#x27;t mind sharing :)  I did receive this razor as a promo from Gillette to test out, love it</li>
    <li> I have a beard but need a decent razor for shaping, etc.  This is a reasonably priced razor that does the job perfectly.  It also shaves through thick hair extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor will also be used to shave my beard now that the warm weather has hit!</li>
    <li> Gillette provide these blades to me through a compaign and I was a little hesitate to use it. I have the 3 in 1 and it works very well. But I will admit I was blown away at how the blades went smoothly across my face. It provided a close shave, smooth lines and stubble left behind. I didn&#x27;t need to reshave the next day at all to be honset! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product if travel a lot and need a razor blade. Hands down its a great buy to keep a quality blade on hand for use.</li>
    <li> With my wife being a couponer, I have tried a lot of different kinds of razors.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide is the one that I seem to always compare all of the other razors to.  From the smooth shave from the 5 blades to the way it feels in your hand to the ease of the shave on your face.  It is the one razor that I look forward to using.  Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> The product is very durable. The duration of the blades is pretty good but does not last forever. The feel of the handle with the curve is good for a confident shave.</li>
    <li> I got a chance to try out the new Fusion ProGlide razor free via a program from Gillette (lucky me). This is great because I love giving new razors a shot because I can never find the perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always skeptical when trying out the newest razors on the market. It seems too often like it is a race to put the most blades onto one shaver. ProGlide, while filled with ample number of blades, feels like each blade is part of a team getting the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades cause very minimal nicks and always felt comfortable with the need for fewer repeat passes. The detail blade on the rear comes in handy when putting a clean edge to a beard (I do it myself instead of paying for it at a barber shop). Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a razor that lasted more then one shave, decided to give them a shot! First thing I though was wow! A nice smooth shave for even the toughest shaves! Blades last too! They&#x27;re worth your money and time!</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette fusion as a part of a program run by Gillette. The razor was ok but even with using a very expensive shaving cream i had a lot of razor bumps would</li>
    <li> I was given the chance to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide, free of charge, through a program run by Gillette.  I have to say is that I was very impressed with the quality of this razor blade. It gives you a very close shave and literally it glides across stubble without any razor burn whatsoever.  Over the last two weeks of trying the Gillette Fusion ProGlide, I didn&#x27;t have any razor marks, bumps or irritation and the blades lasted much longer than I expected.  I absolutely loved trying out this great razor from Gillette and definitely will be looking to buy more products from them in the future!!!</li>
    <li> When trying these razors, I was wondering how it would compare to the one I already have and use. Well this is SO much better than the one I used! The glide on the razors is perfect! The glide is really smooth and leaves my skin feeling great. A very nice comfortable close shave! love them!</li>
    <li> I have a very thick beard and coarse hair. I buy these because they are worth it if you have hair that&#x27;s tough to cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this because if anyone had doubts about the razor I hope to steer them towards the purchase. I received a free sample from Gillette and was trilled with the success! The blades i wish lasted a little longer but shaving daily and being a hairy dude could be that cause haha. WhenIi went to get new blades it took me a little while to make the purchase again but found a nice deal at walgreens with coupons as well! Def. worth the money if want a perfectly clean and smooth shave!</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Manual cartridge for free via a program from Gillette. After using for a few weeks I was satisfied with the shave, it gives a nice shave and no razor burn. This ranks better than other razors I&#x27;ve used but it is on the pricey side. Also the trimmer blade on the back did not last as long as I had hoped but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I received a razor in a recent promotion ran by Gillette for the Fusion ProGlide.  First let me say I am not a manual razor type of person due to constant razor burns and sensitive skin.  Beard grows fast and if going out in the evenings I have to shave again, using my electric razor.  With all the hype and advertisements about the new razors on the market, I decided to sign up.&lt;br /&gt;I must say I was surprised.  For the first 10 days of use, there was no irritation and the closeness was suburb, no 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  After 10 days I noticed that the lubrication strip was disappearing fast and day 17 I noticed more drag and pulling.  The packaged stated 30 days between blade changes and after 20 days I had to stop using the sample.  Replacement blades are pricey, but if you use a manual razor, I have to admit this is one razor I would use.</li>
    <li> I use this razor everytime my whiskers get a little unkempt and I would like to say it is a great razor. So smooth I can shave against the grain and powerful enough that I don&#x27;t have to shave for another day. Thumbs up in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Good for over a months worth of shave on each blade. Pricey but you get what you pay for with a clean smooth shave every time.</li>
    <li> I did really like the blades on the new Gilette Fusion ProGlide. They were very easy to clean, and lasted much longer than cheap disposable razors. I got a nice, smooth, close shave, and did not experience any razor burn or skin irritation. All in all, a great disposable razor. However, I do think that the refills are a little on the pricey side, therefore, I gave a 4 star rating. I received this razor from free from a program run by Gilette.</li>
    <li> The razor is fantastic as I get a very close shave. I had previously used a Shick razor which was not half as good. The Fusion razor does not cut my skin and just glides over my face. I would strongly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Gillette has been around for a long time and believe me there is a reason why--they change with time. I got in this Gillette sponsored program which I was happy to receive a complimentary Fusion Proglide for free. Hey, I already used this, so I will take some of my time to thank them because this flat designed razor with 5 blades! not two, performed so smooth on the face of my cerebral palsy brother whom I helped every other two days. I no longer cringe whenever he jerks his head as he always does when I shave him. Less irritation and no cuts thanks to the designed. Bravo Gillette, for thinking of those who need help.</li>
    <li> I use to just use an electric shaver but when I switched over to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide my face was smoother than I&#x27;ve ever been. The blades are so sharp they get even the tiniest of scruff. Also like how the whole blade itself pivots for easier shaving under the jaw and neck areas. I recommend this product to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been a Gillette fan for years. With that said.. The Fusion ProGlide really isn&#x27;t all that special. With shaving creme it works perfectly. However for quick touch ups with just water it leaves a lot to be desired. The reuse is pretty limited as well. I have gotten more uses out of cheaper disposable blades. Make no mistake, The Fusion ProGlide is a very good razor, but there are better out there as well.</li>
    <li> I received these razors free from Gillette through a program they were running. I have sensitive skin so I was skeptical about using a razor with 5 blades and not breaking out but I was surprised. The razor gave a close shave without irritating my skin, so their was no need to have areas twice. I would recommend these razors to anyone who wants a close shave and don&#x27;t have time to go over areas multiple times.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Cartridge is a cool product. It gave a very clean shave, and unlike most razors I have tried to use, I did not get as many razor bumps as I usually do. I mostly use an electric razor for fear that I will break out a few days after shaving. I&#x27;m still testing it out to see how long or if the razor bumps will come back. I received this through a promotion from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample to try of the ProGlide. I was skeptical at first on how the ProGlide could be that much better than the regular Fusion. I was definitely surprised.  I get a closer shave and there is less resistance when sliding across my face.  The only downside that I have noticed is that the blades wear out faster.  Overall a great razor.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Profusion Proglide for free via a program run by Gillette. The first time I used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I was very surprised with how well it performed. The blade cartridge has thinner blades so you get a smooth shave, less irritation, and quicker shave.  The blades are a bit expensive but well worth it because of the results. I was also surprised at how easy it was to control as I shaved, very impressed with the grip. I would recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide.</li>
    <li> I received these cartridges thru a program ran by gillette. These blades on the cartridge are awesome. I now have to worry about my girlfriend using my razor but really I shouldn&#x27;t, why?? because these razors last for awhile. The shave is super smooth you almost don&#x27;t even need shaving cream. I haven&#x27;t really had a run in with razor burn but I also have been told by my girl that it cuts down ingrown hairs. I love these razors and love the fact that they can be reused on a different handle. Great product all the way around.</li>
    <li> I am used to using a Gillette Mach 3. I recently received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide razor as part of a Gillette promotion. I think it is a nice upgrade to the Mach3 that I am used to using. The 5 different blades gave a nice smooth shave, and I especially liked the ease at which the cartridge moved with the contour of my face. Since I am a fan of Gillette, I will now upgrade to the Fusion Proglide.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> When I first heard of the ProGlide I was a bit skeptical on how it could be that much better than the regular Fusion. The ProGlide is better and has a noticeably better shave than the original fusion. There is definitely much less resistance when sliding this across my face. It also seems like I&#x27;m been getting a closer shave.  Usually I have to shave every other day. Now using the new fusion cartridges I can shave every 3-4 days.  The only bad part that I have noticed so far is that the ProGlide seems to wear down much faster than the old Fusion. I have to replace the ProGlide blades about a week earlier than I used to with the old Fusion.</li>
    <li> Much better price then at the brick and mortar stores, but they are razor blades what can I say&lt;br /&gt;Fusion are what I use and these like all ProGlide Blades give a perfect shave as long as you don&#x27;t use them&lt;br /&gt;more then say 3 or 4 shaves max which makes them a bit expensive ....</li>
    <li> These are the only blades my skin likes.  I use them well past what is recommended since they are usually very overpriced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the ProGlide blades for a few months and think they are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used. I started off using them as a result of a free trial by Gillette. A longtime Gillette fan, these really provide a noticeable closer shave without any irritation. Combined with the FlexBall handle the blades allow a consistently close shave across all countours of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get these as part of a subscription so that you always have blades handy. A nifty idea. I tend to use them longer than I should and like the ease of always having a backup stash versus having to remember to go to the store or order them (plus, ordering online and with a subscription is cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you give these a try! I think you will love them.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades and last for a week or so if you shave every other day, but there are places to get similar blades cheaper online. Since these are so expensive, I&#x27;ve switched off of them for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave every other day to every 2-3 days depending on who I&#x27;m visiting at work for clients. If you shave daily, these will go quickly.</li>
    <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen any difference than the ones I purchase at the store. They give a good shave and last pretty long.</li>
    <li> Good shave for the money</li>
    <li> My husband loves the razor.  He gets so many more shaves with this than any other shaver he has used.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this razor the last couple of mornings and was pleasantly surprised on how smooth the shave was. I have sensitive skin and it was no problem. Being in the military I am required to shave daily when at work and this razor has given me the smoothest shave I can remember in a while. I would highly recommend this to anyone who shaves on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor is great. The blades are smooth and provide a nice clean and close shave. This helps with the pulling of the facial hair and stops a lot of irritation. I would recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for a nice shave without a lot of hassle.</li>
    <li> I loved this razor! My old razors left razor burns on my neck and didn&#x27;t shave my face that well but after using this two times I don&#x27;t have any razor burns and my face is smooth! If you are looking to try a razor that leaves your face feeling smooth and not having razor burns then this is the razor to get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note I received this from Gillette try test it and review it BUT it did not influence my review at all.*</li>
    <li> I got the chance to test out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide via a program from Gillette, and so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 blades really do a great job of giving you a close, smooth shave.  I really liked the edging blade on the back, came in really handy for trimming up after shaving or getting a quick spot that you may have missed.</li>
    <li> I was provided from gillette to see how the sharp blade cartridge is. The sharpness of the blades gave a smooth shave not just with the grain but also going against the grain. With normal blades I dread going against the grain, but with this blade there were no tug and pulls just a smooth cut and a close shave. Further more the lube stripe also smooth the skin real well that I did not have to us any type of aftershave. I have sensetive skin and this blade is the best for that. No irretation to my face at all. This was the first time in along time I did not have razor burn. So I recomend this blade to guys with sensetive skin.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide via a program run by Gillette. I love it! I got a very close shave which I have not gotten in a while. I did not see how it could be much different than the regular Fusion but it is better! It seems as if I am getting a much closer shave. It leaves my face smooth without many shaving bumps. I love this razor and would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I received a Fusion ProGlide as part of a promo from Gillette to review it. I have to say as a life long Mach 3 user I was very impressed with the upgrade. It provided a much smoother shave and little irritation. I also really like the single blade on the opposite side for trimming facial hair. I think I am going to finally upgrade from the Mach 3.</li>
    <li> First let me start by saying this is an impressive looking razor that I received free through a program from Gillette.  It is solid and sturdy, with a handle that is easy to hold when wet with rivets on the handle. With multiple blades, it provides a nice, close shave with no nicks or cuts that lasted all day with no razor burn.  It leaves my face smooth with no shaving bumps!  My girlfriend loved it too!  When she comments on a shave, that means a lot as well.  I have used the razor three times now, and it still is brand new.  Works well on the sideburns too!  I look forward to using it more, as I have now found my new replacement to my B** throwaways!  This razor is really high class!</li>
    <li> Best razor ever! No more razor bumps! I got this razor from a program run by gillette themselves. I give the proglide s razors 5 stars because of how smooth they are while shaving, especially with my super sensitive skin. Definitely sticking with them from now on. I&#x27;m trying to convince my coworkers and family members to definitely give it a try. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Gillette Fusion proglide power blade from Gillette&#x27;s special program. The blades are amazing and smooth. It leaves my skin smooth and rash free. I would buy more blades for myself.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these Gillette blades in a while. I recently received new ones in the mail through a Gillette program and I gotta say I really like them. My skin feels awesome; smooth and glowing. Very nice shave, I will contin&amp;uacute;e to use them and drop my old brand.</li>
    <li> Got to try some of this razor blades in a program done by Gillette and have to say they are great for shaving.  Had a clean close shave, defiantly the best shave I have ever gotten from a razor.  I went to try to pick up more and found that unless you have coupons they are a bit pricey but I have considered buying them because I didn&#x27;t have razor burn on my face and the shave was really close and made my skin feel smooth.  Best razor blades ever Gillette.</li>
    <li> I got this razor via a program run by Gillette and I was extremely satisfied with the smooth shave that I got from using it. It didn&#x27;t pull hair or cut my face. A+</li>
    <li> I received my free razor the other day from a Gillette run program.  When I first looked I noticed the multiple blades that looked sharp as ever.  The next day I tried it and was very surprised at how close a shave I got and how it got to most of the hard to reach places.  My skin is little tough to get to all places on first try, but the ProGlide did a really good job of getting to most (except right under the nose).</li>
    <li> This was a great razor.  Not perfect but I think it did the job.  I use this to shave my head and I was glad that it worked with the first pass. I hate having to use a razor numerous times on one spot on my head.  The only thing was the precision razor on the other end seemed pointless.  But for a close shave this actually worked pretty good.</li>
    <li> recently received this razor free from a program run by Gillette. I have tried the razor several times and think that it is a really good razor. I have somewhat sensitive skin and this razor didn&#x27;t leave me with razor burn or knicks. The blades don&#x27;t seem to be getting dull yet and I hoping that it will Last.</li>
    <li> I recently received these blades via a free program run by Gillette.  I was skeptical at first as I always use cheap disposable razors.  I sure am glad I tried these.  It cut through my facial hair like it was butter.  It left my face smooth and velvety with absolutely no irritation.  I recommend these blades to everyone.  I will be using these from now on as they are fantastic</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for awhile and have to say it is much better than many of the other razors I use. It gives me a very smooth shave and best of all I get no cuts or razor burn. I don&#x27;t even use shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free razor provided by a program run by Gillette to test it out. Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> I got to try this razor free through a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with the closeness of the shave.  But the best feature was that the hair didnt clog up in the shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;Great design!</li>
    <li> I got this free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I used sensitive skin shave gel with this razor and I wouldve&lt;br /&gt;been better off shaving with a rock. The blades were dull theres&lt;br /&gt;was not enough lubrication on the strip and the razor gave me bumps&lt;br /&gt;and cut my face up and the hair grew back the next morning&lt;br /&gt;i would not recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and don&#x27;t mind the name on the review, I&#x27;m using my girlfriends&lt;br /&gt;amazon account - ROBERT</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette&#x27;s Fusion system for some time now and have always loved the comfort of the handle.  This new razor handle is more comfortable than previous versions and makes it very easy to shave.  I recommend upgrading if you are already using the Fusion system and also recommend considering switching to this system and the new handle if you are not already a fusion user.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Fusion ProGlide razor that provided via a program by Gillette. I enjoyed shaving with the razor because it glided easily and my skin felt so soft and smooth after shaving.</li>
    <li> The Proglide is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. When I first tried this product I was thinking it just like every other, but much to my surprise it worked so well. I have always had the bad habit of shaving in both directions and with the proglide it smooth in both directions. No pulls at all even with repeated use the blades normally last about a month that makes spending the money on the blades even easier. My over all review is a thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> Very Impressed. Left my sensitive skin smooth. I have a hard time finding razors that don&#x27;t irritate my face but this one really did the trick.</li>
    <li> Was sent the new proglide FREE to try out via a Gillette program and am really enjoying it.  Very smooth, solid handle, and feels great, especially for a manual razor.  Normally I prefer electric when I can, but this has me rethinking my stance.  Solid stuff!</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best I have tried in years, I always have cuts from my old razor but not here. I was so happy to not have TP all over my face and neck. And baby smooth face after the shave. The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Recently I have been a little skeptical on the new razors.  What difference do the more and more blades really make?  Over the last several years I was sticking with my old standby as I had not been impressed with the new razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently received a sample of the New Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge and handle.  I tried it with a bit of hesitation and WOW I am now a believer and will be buying more in future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a glide with the razor that I had not experience before.  I had never been able to get such a close shave with that little effort.  I think the biggest thing that I was impressed with was the smoothness of my skin after shaving.  My skin is sensitive and the enhanced lubricating strip really made a difference.  I will pay the extra money for the cartridges in the future.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide is truly an excellent razor. I am a big fan of going old school with a straight razor, but when I received this for free through a special program by Gillette, I tried it. It was smooth as butter, and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. A must for manly-men.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin... and normal razors tear my face up... but Gillette is a god send with their new product that was blade that literally just glide over the skin, take the hair from your face, and leave you feeling smooth and non irritated... Thank you Gillette!!!</li>
    <li> So glad that I took advantage of Gillette&#x27;s free razor promotion.  The cartridges are amazing.  The blades cut super close and leave my skin feeling really smooth. Alot smoother than other blades that I have used in the past.  For how close it shaves it does not irretate the skin.  tp be honest didn&#x27;t have any arzor burn either. No sting when I sprayed on my cologne. Great product would recommend to all guys.</li>
    <li> I recently received this razor free from a program run by Gillette. I have tried the razor several times and think that it is a really good razor. I have somewhat sensitive skin and this razor didn&#x27;t leave me with razor burn or knicks. The blades don&#x27;t seem to be getting dull yet and I hoping that this cartridge will last for a few more shaves. I would recommend this razor to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I received a gillette Fusion Proglide free from a program gillette was running. I gave it a try and let me tell you, it was amazing. It glided over my skin so easily and smoothly, leaving my skin feeling so soft and silky. The Proglide has many thinner sharp blades with a great lubrastrip that made it simple and easy to shave, where as the throwaways dont have the extra blades and no lubrastrip making it difficult and hard to shave. The shave was the closest I have ever had, I was shaving daily with throwaways now with Proglide I can skip days and still feel great and not have to worry. The trimmer was great and made it easy to shave around things with no clogging. The only down side is that this razor is a little pricey but would you rather have a good clean shave or a horrible sandpaper shave.</li>
    <li> I recieved a free razor from a program run by Gillette.  They sent me a Fushion Proglide to try out and I must say I was Iimpressed.  There are 5 blades which go smoothly across your skin.  I didnt even get any cuts or razor burn from this product!  The shave left me feeling smooth and cleaning the blades was super easy.  No stuck hairs for me.  My only complaint is the price.  While they work great, I don&#x27;t have the money to be spening on these blades.  If the price isn&#x27;t a concern for you, try them out.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> For about 10 years I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors with 3 blades and I just recently tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide and I&#x27;m so happy I did. The get less bumps and cuts on my face since switching. I recommend this product all the way...</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor is one of the best.  The blades are terrific for a close shave.  Easy to load and unload.  What a wonderful design they have.  If you want a close shave with no hassles, this is it.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this razor, I was stoked, I really wanted to try a 4 blade razor.  Unfortunately, it was less than good.  The first shave I could feel a ton of little knicks.  The skin wasn&#x27;t cut, but there was lots of little pinches.  It didn&#x27;t get as close to a shave as I thought it would, and my Mach 3 Turbo seems to do just as good a job, if not better, especially without the knicking.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide from Gillette. Anytime I shave with a razor, I get nicks and cuts and bleed like a stuck pig. But I am a gamer and I tried the Fusion ProGlide. The results were the best shave I ever had. Smooth shave, no nicks or cuts. No bumping from in grown hairs. I am impressed and will use it again.</li>
    <li> This razor cartridge was amazing. I loved that the shave was so close. The blades moved along the contours of my face nicely. It was a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I have gotten to test a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette and i must say it is a great razor no irritation or razor bumps. It Is defiantly a razor i will let family and friends about. Still works great after one use. It is pricy but well worth the price</li>
    <li> I received  Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge via a program run by Gillette for free. The first time I used the razor I was not too impressed but I was in a hurry. The second time I used it I actually had time to go over a few times and it worked pretty well. The blades trim very smoothly with out any nicks or cuts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a long while since I used a manual razor instead of an electric trimmer (going with the constant scruff look for the most part), and I was a bit hesitant to use a clean shaving razor again. No worries with this thing, though. It did it&#x27;s job without roughing up my skin or nicking my face. A smooth shave to be sure, I&#x27;ll be keeping some cartridges on hand in case I every want to get a closer cut. Razor acquired via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette. I assumed the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual cartridge was going to perform like all the others but was wrong. I have extremely sensitive skin and every blade I run across my face causes burning and nicks not to mention a less than close shave. These blades are perfect for my skin. The blades caused no razor burn and they actually glide across my skin leaving no nicks. The precision trimmer is excellent for shaping my sideburns or if I want that say old growth left but shaped up nicely. I also believe the added lubricants in the enhanced lubrastrip helps the ease of the blade as well as leaving my skin soft. Will not change from this blade. It&#x27;s perfect for this baby faced guy.</li>
    <li> This product was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette. First of all, I love Gillette products. Haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet. Love this razor. I would have to say one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used by Gillette or any other brands. Gave me a nice smooth close shave. There was no nicks or cuts and the razor moved smoothly whichever way I wanted to shave. I would recommend this to everyone even women who wants a nice clean smooth shave. My wife is even going to go buy herself one.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor thru a Gillette program and was surprised at how great it was. The blades get a super close shave without irritating my skin and leaving razor burn. Same quality in the multiple uses as it was the first time. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from a program run by Gillette. I usually only use an electric razor, but sometimes when the mood strikes I will use a manual razor. I use this razor a few times over the past two weeks. It works fairly well, but it is not much better than other manual razors. It seems to get a pretty close shave and the lubricating gel worked well, but seemed to run empty pretty quickly on my face. I do have very coarse hair, which could be a cause of it. On my neck, it did a pretty decent job and only left one or two razor burns. I will most likely stick to my electric razor due to less cost over time, but if I&#x27;m ever in a pinch, I will definitely consider it. The cartridges are a little out of my price range, which is why I can&#x27;t give this five stars. The price is a huge factor. Maybe if there is a sale a coupon out there, I would certainly give it another go!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for free via a program run by Gillette.  I have a new baby and have to shave frequently so I don&#x27;t scratch his skin.  With these razors, my skin has never been smoother.  They give me the closest shave possible without causing any nicks or cuts.  I am really impressed with how many uses I have been able to get out of one razor.  With other manual razors I have had to change the blades every few days- with teh Fusion ProGlide, I have used the same blade for almost 2 weeks!  Another great feature of these blades is that they are close together yet they dont clog.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This razor is very smooth. I have sensitive skin and when I do not get a razor burn after I use a razor it is a good one. It doesn&#x27;t dull out quick and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I shave every day, and insist on an extremely close shave. I&#x27;m extremely particular about my razors; used to use Schick Extreme 3, which to my way of thinking were better than anything from Gillette, including the regular ProGlide. But these blades work better than anything I have ever used. Smooth, comfortable and close. The single blade on the back side makes trimming sideburns and around the nose very easy. And they last much longer than other blades, so although they are ridiculously expensive, to me it&#x27;s definitely worth it. free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> Got this razor free &amp; I have to say the razor is very good but I am not happy with the price of the cartridges. For me they are a little expensive when you are watching every penny. Wish the price was cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have used many different shavers because I have very sensitive skin.  Regardless of the claims, I always seem to breakout on the face.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this free razor I received from a program run by Gillette was going to be any different.  I must say that this Fusion Razor is indeed for sensitive skin.  I used the Fusion Gel Shaving Cream and this razor and have not bumped up at all.  There was no pull and tug on my skin and it left me with a super smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that provides a complete close shave *without* nicking the skin. The razor leaves your face feeling smooth and provides as close as a shave as possible. Highly recommend purchasing this razor if you want an easy razor that provides a very close shave without extra effort. This razor was provided to me free, via a program run by Gillette. Also, my wife loved how soft it made my skin!</li>
    <li> these blades give the closest shave i have ever had I have to say Gillette Fusion did it again!! I love this razor, My skin is so soft, yes the blades are a little high and seem to go dull faster but that might be because of the fact your not shaving everyday but more hair when you do. I have to say finding the blades on here cheaper in the stores is great so I won&#x27;t have to worry about the price!!</li>
    <li> The Fusion ProGlide gives you that close, comfortable, close shave that you look for.It isn&#x27;t harsh on your skin and the moisturizing strip helps prevent razor burn. The price of the blades is decent for the quality of the shave. This is absolutely a product I would recommend. Give it a shot.</li>
    <li> Gillette has truly out done themselves! Not only did I get to try this razor free through a program run by Gillette but this razor was unbelievably easy to clean. My facial hair was a little longer than when I would have normally shaved and was a little bit worried about irritation, possible hair pulling etc. However, I was seriously impressed at the fact that not one of the hairs ever felt like it was being pulled, and the irritation I anticipated to receive was non-existent. This razor did a phenomenal job. The only drawback I experienced was after just one shave the gel strip was already down to the white backer.</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual cartridge, courtesy of a free sample program run by Gillette.  Overall I found it to be an excellent performer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had good experience with the company&#x27;s products in the past, and have used their MACH 3 brand for many years.  This cartridge performed better than the MACH 3 for me.  The cutting was smoother, less effort needed.  It felt like there may have been more lubricant on it than the MACH 3 has.  My skin is somewhat sensitive, and I did not feel irritation after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any bad experiences with the shave itself.  I know that the newer cartridges can be very expensive in retail stores, and that would have me hesitating whether it was affordable to use this brand all the time.  But as good as the shaving experience was, I will strongly consider switching to buy this new model.</li>
    <li> I love these blades! I received these via a program run by Gillette. At first I was intimidated by the sheer number of blades on the cartridge. I have used the blades before and was glad to receive another set from this campaign. The blades are very thin and I have never cut myself shaving with them. The single blade on the back (thus \\&quot;fusion\\&quot;) is also incredibly useful for detailing and sideburns etc. I can shave so quickly with these blades and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going to another razor any time soon.</li>
    <li> I have been trying the Fusion proglide blades under a gillette free try program and find the blade to be very smooth. The size of the cartridge is a problem for me and I am unable to get in to the nooks of my face like under my nose. I recomend the blade for those wanting a close shave however the nooks and crannies go begging.</li>
    <li> I recieved free Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge and I think they are great blades!!  They are durable and provide a clean close shave.  I will continue to use these blades!!</li>
    <li> I was given a free razor to try from a program that Gillette was running.  I have to admit that I have always been a Schick man but after about a week of using the Proglide I may be switching.  It leaves me with a much closer, smoother shave.  It doesn&#x27;t pull at my skin if I have missed a day of shaving.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the blades shaving capability. I was able to perfect my side burns and reach certain areas on my face (my upper lip and the crease of my neck) with ease. All it took was a single pass over the areas I wanted to completely shave to achieve the results I wanted. Unlike many other blades I have tried, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and left my face feeling smooth and looking cleanly shaved. I&#x27;m happy to say I have officially found a new razor that has all of the capabilities I am looking for. Thank you Gillette for opening me up to a new experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently rocking a beard so I haven&#x27;t given this a full test, but it has done a tremendous job of keeping my neck looking clean. I received the product for free from a program run by Gillette. I&#x27;ve been using a Gillette beard trimmer to shape the beard and this ProGlide cartridge to clean up the stubble on my neck. The combo of the two have made having a playoff beard quite bearable. Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> I got this razor as part of a promotional kit via a program run by Gillette and when I used the razor I found that it works great as long as I don&#x27;t use it on any of my thicker hair. If I use it on thicker hair it takes forever to cut and I feel like I&#x27;m hacking my face.</li>
    <li> I received these blades as a promo through Gillette and I have to say they are the best blades I have ever used. I have shaved with it a week now and the same blade is still holding just as sharp as day 1. It gives me the the closest shave I have ever had with no nicks, cuts or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The moisturizing strip only lasts a couple of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;The price of them in the store is very high, so I doubt if I will continue to use these unless I find a very deep discount or good coupons.</li>
    <li> I received one of these razors through a program run by Gillette and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my new razor. It is by far, one of the best razors I have ever used. My skin has been feeling very smooth and it almost feels like the blades don&#x27;t even touch my face. They literally glide without creating and nicks, cuts, bumps, you name it. I did not use the trimmer on the back of the razor very much since my sideburns are rather thick. However, I did use it for lining up my mustache and it works fantastic! I recommend this razor to any man looking to improve that thing they have in their medicine cabinets that calls itself a razor. Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> For a while now, a good shave was hard to come by. Consistently my face was roughed up by crappy razor blades that refused to give me that close shave that works wonders on the ladies. Then, like a gift from the heavens, I received this fine shaving instrument from the fine folks at Gillette thanks to a promotion and I am loving it so far. The blades really do give you a closer shave with less irritation then my Gillette fusion at about the same price, if not cheaper. For this reason I plan on continuing my upgrade, because I know my face will thank me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product at least three times and i am so in love with it, it keeps my husband face so smooth, he usually has to shave everyday but with this razor he is shaving maybe every other day it is great so IN THE LONG RUN WE ARE SAVING MONEY, CAUSE HE IS NOT NEEDING TO SHAVE AS MUCH, A GREAT RAZOR, MUST USE it, you will not be dissapointed</li>
    <li> As part of a product campaign, I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor to try. My first review was fantastic but I was looking for longevity. After about two weeks I&#x27;ve had a chance to use the same blade now for three shaves. Correct, I don&#x27;t shave a lot. After the third try it is keeping its smoothness. The price point, just over a dollar a blade, is high for me coming from the 2 blade disposable razors. Every time I get a good clean shave out of it, that brings my cost down. We&#x27;ll see how the next two weeks go but I am hopeful.</li>
    <li> I used this product and was pleasantly surprised with the smoothness of the shave.  I would have given it 5 stars, but like other razors it doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me.  I shave every other day and sometimes multiple days in a row, and wish I could find a razor that is going to last long, especially for the cost of the product.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the Gillette Fusion blade but (after receiving a new one to try out from Gillette after not having used one for awhile) I was really disappointed.  The blade did glide smoothly along the skin and you could tell that it had a lubricating strip.  It offered a non tugging shave but I dont know if they changed the way the blades were made or if I received a defective one but it left a spotty shave and I had to go over it numerous times to get all of the hair and stubble.  Really disappointed in this blade this time but will try another blade and give them another chance then we will see</li>
    <li> The Gilette fusion proglide was just what i expected but no more. I recieved it in a free promotion and was eager to try it. Previously i used the mach 3 turbo. i didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference between the blades. Both ofered a good shave but the proglide was not substantially smoother or better in any noticably way. Still its a good shave but i wouldn&#x27;t pay extra for it.</li>
    <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin quite as much as Gillette razors in the past. I have extremely sensitive skin on my neck. I would recommend that cartridges are replaced as soon as needed. Once the blades start to dull, it&#x27;s quite hard on the skin, but that&#x27;s the same with any razor. Thank you Gillette for allowing me that chance to try this for free!</li>
    <li> I used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor and it works wonderfully. I was a little skeptical at first. I don&#x27;t use a razor often. But I used it the fist time and have used it many times since. I was very pleased, no nicks, no pulls or snugs either. what great blades. Thank you so much Gillette.</li>
    <li> First off I have to say I was amazed at the smooth shave from the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor.I was able to try this razor via a program run by Gillete. I like that  the razor is 5 blades compared to three or four blades.It gave me a smooth shave start to finish.I like that it has a precision blade so i can get to those hard to get places and know where I am cutting.I tend to have sensitive skin and feel irritated after i shave but not with the Gillete Proglide Razor.If you are looking for a great razor that gives a smooth shave time and time again this is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different razors over the years, and I need one that&#x27;s not only good for my face, but I shave my head every day as well and I need one that fits the bill.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor is the only one I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t leave me with razor burn and literally &#x27;glides&#x27;, in an incredibly smooth manner.  The only razor I&#x27;ll ever own.</li>
    <li> Great blade &amp; Razor. Highly recommend, better than Barber shave.</li>
    <li> Love these razors... will and have ordered again and again</li>
    <li> My husband is cheap, but agreed to try this out if I got a great price.  Well, I had this delivered and he tried it and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Like the subrscription shipping. Never run out of razors and stuck for weeks with a dull one.</li>
    <li> 5 Blades do the job. Good value for a good shave.</li>
    <li> These blades cut my face all the time.  The quality is not worth the money paid.  I would rather buy from Dorco.  You can get a year&#x27;s supply of blades (and razor) for the price of one pack.</li>
    <li> prompt delivery and a good price</li>
    <li> Must have in my shaving kit along with my regular Norelco Electric Shaver... Especially when the hair grows more than what electric shaver can handle and when in hurry or to have precision saving...</li>
    <li> Great product n price</li>
    <li> Good blades for shaving. Still think the proprietary blade market is a racket. That&#x27;s how they get ya. :)</li>
    <li> I thought it would have been some cheapo fake stuff but it&#x27;s real and works very well. Just like what you buy from the pharmacy</li>
    <li> Gillette products for me is one of the best</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think that I would like these &amp;#34;proglide&amp;#34; blades more than the regular fusion blades... I thought it would turn out to be a bunch of hype and marketing crap.  It is not!  I find that they are better!  They do shave closer.  It is amazing!</li>
    <li> My husband likes these.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE ITEMS. THEY ARE ALL DULL!!! I BELIEVE THEY ARE EXPIRED OR SOMETHING</li>
    <li> Today, January 28, I changed the blade on my Proglide manual razor for the first time since I bought it on October 1st, 4 months ago.  I did not NEED to change the blade, as it was still cutting the whiskers.  I just began to feel a little pull, so I went for comfort.  The secret, I believe, to this success and blade longevity is to avoid propelled shaving cream products such as Edge or Foamy.  These create tenacious deposits which dull the blade edges with only a few uses.  Trader Joe&#x27;s carries a pair of shaving lotions: Mango/Vanilla and scentless, which rinse cleanly from the 5 blades and preserve keen edges despite providing excellent lift and lube.  My beard is thick, and I shave every morning without fail.  This performance is all I need to justify paying the fairly rich price for these cartridges.  The flex ball technology in the handle also keeps  the blades in better contact with the skin.  This minimizes the number of passes required to provide a close, complete shave.</li>
    <li> I used to have the regular fusion, it gave me a nice shave, wanted something quick and easy and went for a high-end Braun that I paid $130 for back on a Black Friday deal. It gave me razor bumps like crazy and uneven shave. Then heard that I could save money by switching to a nice old school double edged razor blade and concentrated shaving soap, I can tell you it gave me a better shave than the Braun but would get some cuts often and skin would get irritated. Decided to go back to desposible razors as seeing that I never had an issue with it. So, picked up Gillette Fusion Proglide and wasn&#x27;t disappointed! Ultra smooth and close shave and done in no time! I say stick to the manual, the power just seems like a marketing gimmick.</li>
    <li> I use them but I can&#x27;t believe the cost of blades is so high. It&#x27;s the brand I&#x27;ve been using for several years now and am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t seem as sharp as the Fusions I used to buy at the Walgreens&#x27;</li>
    <li> The blades are fine but I feel the cost is excessive and the effort put forth too extend the life of your blades because of their cost is even more so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will you get a close shave?  Absolutely, for the first few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use I find the spaces between the blades get clogged and requires more effort than necessary to unclog.  This is partly due to using a shaving oil underneath a shaving cream.  Why use both?  Try it, you&#x27;ll get a much smoother, closer shave.  P.S.  You&#x27;re also using a shaving brush to apply your cream?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get ingrown hairs, your blade is past its life.  Mileage will vary but I find the close shave disappears after four shaves or so with these.  Which I don&#x27;t think is saying much because I used to get the same mileage out of the Gillette Sensor Excels.  In the reviews some people are experiencing good luck extending the life of these blades with their daily rituals, cotton balls and alcohol, towel drying your blade, but I want to spend time on my face, not my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally opted for a safety razor.  Merkur makes some nice handles and I&#x27;m swapping blades every two uses.  So for 17$, I&#x27;m getting three plus months of shaving since I don&#x27;t shave every single day but when I do shave, the face feels great and no more so, so experiences with a blade that should have been tossed out a shave or two ago.  Start your morning off right, try a quality safety razor and with the money saved on blades, upgrade your skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, my 15 or 20 minute ritual can sometimes be the only &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; time I have so use good products and treat yourself well.</li>
    <li> Perfect and exactly as I expected.  Delivery was fast too!</li>
    <li> I buy these from Amazon when they have their deals.  I have three men in the house and they all use Gillette Fusions, so I have to keep a constant supply coming!  I asked, and they seem to get an average of 10-12 shaves per cartridge.  I guess this is normal.  The cartridges always work great, snap on, and are easy to snap off and throw away.  Plenty sharp and do the job!</li>
    <li> work great and even better with a handle</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re buying refills you know what you&#x27;re getting.  Great razors, have been using them for a while and love them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how guys find out about these fantastic improvements in shaving, but my husband will buy this forever. The blades are so expensive, but he says they&#x27;re SO worth it!</li>
    <li> Blades provide a very close shave without constantly taking passes over previously shaved areas. Cost with well timed automatic delivery from Amazon save money and having to routinely purchase this item at what likely are higher prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Price with auto delivery that is determined by you.&lt;br /&gt;Very good blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;None for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Buy with automatic renewal. Set shipment date in line with your use. Auto renewal can be cancelled at any time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with the Power version of these blades. The fusion proglide blade will last through several shaves and the lubricating strip on these blades is much longer lasting than anything else in the Gillette line.</li>
    <li> Nice replacement razors.  Good price should last me about 7 months.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide provided me with one of the smoothest, closest shaves that I&#x27;ve had in quite a while. I an an avid user of Gillete products and until now have been a faithful use of the Mach 3 razor. While I am still very satisfied with my old Mach 3, I feel that Gillete has made some serious improvements with the Fusion Proglide. I feel the action was much more effortless and left my skin feeling great thanks to the thinner, finer blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend the Fusion Proglide to anyone looking for a new razor cartridge to get an effortless, smooth shave!</li>
    <li> Not only did I recieve this blade free through a program run through Gilette I like it alot but the price of the blades are costly. I have tried what 1 person said about drying them but it dont last forever. I would still buy these because the shave was really good.</li>
    <li> For a long time, I just used regular disposable razors. When I saw that a razor was provided via a program run by Gillette and I could get one free to try, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I had no idea what to expect from this razor. The first time I used it, I had three days worth of stubble on my face. This blade gave me a very smooth and close shave. Unlike the disposable razors, there was no pulling of the skin on my face to cut off the stubble. The handle fit in my hand nicely and it&#x27;s very easy to replace razors. I haven&#x27;t finished with my first blade yet so I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll take to wear out, but with my thick beard, it should last longer than the disposables I normally use. I would recommend this razor to anyone that asks.</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a program run by Gilette and I am so glad I did. This razor surpasses any razor I have ever used in the past. It was a very smooth shave. There were no pulls or snags like you get with many other razors. The moisturizing strip also made my skin feel smoother and not irritated after I was done. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a great, comfortable, easy to use and affordable razor, beats the pants off disposible razors. I will never use anything else but this.</li>
    <li> I shave everyday and I feel that the Gillettes Fusion ProGlide cartridges work very well for me. A friend of mine says that he doesn&#x27;t shave everyday so he&#x27;s not impressed. He feels it only works best for short hair. I wouldn&#x27;t know that because I shave everyday, I always have. The Gillette ProGlide Razor was provided by Gillette for a program testing that I particated in.</li>
    <li> I have had a chance to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide, which was provided via a program run by Gillette. The cartridge is okay. I have sensitive skin, and I still had some razor burn after using these blades. The blades seem nice enough though. They are very sleek and thin.</li>
    <li> Normally I use whatever the cheapest store brand throw away razor I can find. I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide razor through a program through Gillette and there is no way I&#x27;m going back. Just like the commercials, this razor provides a smooth, close shave with zero pulling and after 3 uses, no nicking from dull blades. This is definitely a razor I recommend.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor is an excellent razor. I got this product for free and I was very excited when I received it. I tried it for the first time the next morning and it left my face extra smooth.  The cartridges are easy to install, affordable, and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I shave daily for my profession (Firefighter). I often breakout, especially on my chest. With this new blade I am breaking out a lot less (From 60% breakout coverage to 5% breakout coverage). I am also feeling like I have a closer shave. Usually by afternoon I am stubbly, but with the close shave I am still feeling mostly smooth. I will definitely continue to use. Plus the razor seems to be lasting a lot longer (I am getting more shaves!)</li>
    <li> I received this free razor via a program run by Gillette.  That being said, I love it.  The fusion does a great job at trimming facial hair. It provides a well groomed appearance and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide from a program run by Gillette and gave it a try. This way, by far, one of the best razors I have ever used. It effortlessly glides across skin with no irritation. The addition of the precision trimmer on the back is nice, and makes it very easy to shave trouble spots, like the area under the nose, and even out sideburns. I found it performed very well at dealing with one or two days of stubble, but beyond that, it tended to get a little clogged with hair and required multiple passes. Aside from that minor complaint, the closeness and comfort of this shave make it a must-try!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide by a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a good heft and good rubber grips so holding it is a pleasure. It is also good quality, with a solid attachment mechanism with good action.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are comfortable and light to shave with, and I would recommend them for particularly sensitive skin. They are great for manscaping (particularly underarms). My facial hair is very multi-directional, and I found the thinner blades to be less effective than the regular Gillette Fusion. The back blade is a wonderful addition that is very useful for edging. I like the razor.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any benefit from the reformulated lubrication strip.</li>
    <li> This is the most comfortable razor that I have ever used.  It is smooth and the 5 thin blades just simply glide over your face and cut the hair so accurate and precise!! My skin feels so soft and smooth. The handle fits perfectly in my hand...as if it was designed just for me!!  I will never use anything but The Gillette Fusion Proglide</li>
    <li> I got to try this Fusion Proglide blade through a program sponsored by Gillette,and im glad I did! I wasnt sure at first it work as well as I had heard,but i was impressed. It handled a weeks worthbof stubble on my head and face like it was nothing! After the shave, my skin was super smooth and no irritation. I&#x27;m definitely a fan now!</li>
    <li> I received these to test out for free from the Gillette company.While these blades are costly they are effeminately worth it.  I have never gotten this close of a shave in the past and i have found that if i dry the blades completely after use they tend to last much longer so less blades to buy.</li>
    <li> I am the type of person who is always looking for the best quality in products that I spend my hard earned money on. I received one of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridges via a program led by Gillette. These blades are amazing! They are thinner than my typical brand razor and cut much closer. The lubricating strip really works so no more red irritated skin after I shave. Gillette, you should be proud of yourself and keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> I received this razor by a program run by Gillette. The Gillete Fusion ProGlide Razor blades give me a nice, clean close shave. I love that I don&#x27;t have to shave as much when I use these blades. My only gripe is they are kind of pricey.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor was a free razor provided by a program run by Gillette.The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor is the best razor I have found that worked best for me. I have bought other brand name razors but it was the ProGlide that gave me the closest,smoothest and the most comfortable shave ever. I was able to shave in any direction and left no stubble,bumps or any irritation to my face. The handle has rubber grips that will not slip out of your hands even when your fingers are wet. I love my new ProGlide.</li>
    <li> Thanks to the people at Gillette I was able to try their Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Cartridge razor blades for free.  I love that Gillette is the #1 brand razor for sensitive skin.  It really made a difference when I shaved compared to other razors.  My skin was less irritated after shaving than it normally is.  I love that the razor has 5 thinner blades.  They help make sure you get all the hair in one go rather than having to go over an area multiple times.  One thing I really loved is the lubrication strip that contains lubricants and mineral oil.  That helps keep my skin from being irritated.  Another great addition these razor blades have is a precision trimmer blade with anti-clogging rinse slots.  The trimmer makes it seem like two products in one.  This is by far the best razor blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I liked the shave I got from this razor cartridge I received for free from a program ran by Gillette. I gave the review 3 stars because of the price, I felt that 5 dollars every week is a bit high for a shave. Yes I could still use the cartridge longer then a week but all of its greatness diminishes rapidly once the aloe in the strip depletes and the blades begin to dull. I started noticing more nicks around the 6 day mark and around 10 days it wasn&#x27;t as pleasant of a shave. If you have the money to spend this is a great product but for average Joe buying generic bread it just doesn&#x27;t fit my budget.</li>
    <li> My wife singed me up for this Buzz Campain thing that they send you products and you use them and review them she is always looking for ways to save the family money. These razors last for ever and have a nice smooth close shave. They last about 5 times longer then the cheap throw away ones you buy at the store 8 cartridges would last me about three to four months!</li>
    <li> I love the blades on the razor. the shave is consistent, nick free, and I get the closest shave possible. The lubricating strips are great as they keeps my face protected from irritation. The blade also lasts a while so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from a promotional program run by Gillette and so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it out. I&#x27;ve used Gillette&#x27;s disposable razors in the past along with numerous other brands, but this was the first handle/cartridge combo I&#x27;ve really given a shot. There was a world of difference between the two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was much closer than any of the previous razors I had used, and the blades were nice and sharp so it didn&#x27;t feel like the hair was being plucked rather than cut like sometimes happened with cheaper blades. It also dealt with the thickness of my facial hair really well, and cleared the worst patch up with only one or two additional passes at what is near full length for my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being quite sharp, I didn&#x27;t experience any skin irritation at all and didn&#x27;t once cut myself. Whether that&#x27;s a testament to the moisturizer pad and alignment of the blades on the cartridge or just a steadier hand than normal and my shaving cream I can&#x27;t tell, but it definitely added to the positive experience!</li>
    <li> These blades have given me the cleanest, closest shave I have experienced. I&#x27;ve always been the type of person that thought that cheap disposable razors were good enough. When I received these as a part of program ran by Gillette for free, I thought these were going to be just some overpriced razor blades and that they wouldn&#x27;t make that big of a difference, boy was I wrong! I realize that these have a high cost, but that&#x27;s because its so worth it! The shave is incredible, no nicks, has the built in lube strip, makes everything just gliiiide!</li>
    <li> After receiving a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide from a program run by Gillette, I was excited to see what the razor brought to the table. I was not disappointed, as the ProGlide provided a great shave - smooth and comfortable. The blades did not aggravate my sensitive skin, and the precision trimmer allowed me to maintain the hard to reach spots. The enhanced lubrastrip seemed to fade rather quickly, but that can be said about most razor cartridges. Overall, I would highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for those looking for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the price of the Fusion ProGlide, as a lot of comments say, as I received a razor as part of a free trial program through Gillette, but regardless of price, I think this new razor is well worth it. I have used plenty of Gillette products in the past, its been a love/hate relationship depending on the product. However, the Fusion ProGlide seems to take the cake. I love the 5 blades because it allows for a much faster shave without the worry of nicking and cutting my face. It literally has cut my shave time in half. It also leaves my face feeling rather smooth which is a plus for my wife. The last Gillette product I purchased did not have a top blade which comes in handy for trimming my sideburns, but the Fusion ProGlide does and it is great. I would recommend the ProGlide even if you have tried Gillette in the past and you were not satisfied. Forget the price and get a happy and smooth face. It is well worth it.</li>
    <li> have been using the Gillette Fusion cartridge for a few weeks now.  I am getting a closer shave and no nicks or cuts.  This blade glides over my skin for a cut so nice and clean my other half has a hard time keeping her hands off my face now.  I was not sure about it at first since I got the free razor in a program by Gillette but now I know I will be using these blades from now on.  Way to go Gillette what a great product.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide gives you a nice shave.  It glides smoothly and is simple to operate.  There are no bells and whistles, but I also get no nicks and bumps from using it.  However, I am not completely fond of the trimmer side.  It just seems a little awkward.  Compared to other razors of similar make, I feel that the moisturizing strip could be a little bit better too.  Overall, however, for a quick shave, I would definitely give it another try. Thanks to Gillette for letting me try it through their test program.</li>
    <li> Gillette gave me a free Fusion Proglide for me to test. I have sensitive skin and with the Gillette fusion Proglide I had a smooth nick-free and razor burn free shave. I love the single blade on the back of the razor for precision and trim my sideburns. Love it.</li>
    <li> I usaully cut myself shaving and have hard time getting close shave so I was very surprised with thses blades they really got it right and the handle is nice to get a steady shave too</li>
    <li> I love this razor it was amazing it left me feeling smooth and no stubs and the shave last way longer then what my normal razor last thank you the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette thank you Gillette as soon as my blade gets bad on this one i will be going right to the store to buy new  Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge</li>
    <li> These blades are awesome. I got them for free from a Gillette program and they are super sharp and smooth. I tend to dry shave a bunch with just water and no shaving cream if I&#x27;m in a hurry, and these blades don&#x27;t hurt or leave a rash. Obviously they are new, so I&#x27;ll have to see how they hold up over time.</li>
    <li> I have been a supporter of the mach 3 since i started shaving at 15 and I had tried the Fusion when it first came out years ago. I honestly didnt care for the added blades back then and went back to the mach 3. Recently through Gillette, I received a free trial razor to see if the changes would sway me back to the Fusion line. I noticed right off the bat the longer hairs were easier to get rid of and when it got down to the end I had a lot more hairs left than i normally do. BUT the magic begins when you flip this razor over and use the precision trimmer. On top of being able to get all the hairs on the first cut with it it seemed to get them just as close as the other side! No \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; area was off limits to the trimmer. I think i will be sticking with the fusion for a while, if nothing else for the ease and handiness of the trimmer. Say bye-bye to those silly 3 blade razors and hello to the NEW Fusion ProGlide!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide offered an excellent shave but had diminishing quality after the second and third shave.  A free razor was provided for me to try through Gillette with detailed reviews of both the cartridge and handle.  The cartridge seemed to be ok but one of the blades rusted after the first shave.  I couldn&#x27;t believe this happened, as I thought a better metal would have been used, as rust doesn&#x27;t go well on the face.  Overall, the quality of the shaves were great but the blades did seem to suffer from lefover material after each shave that couldn&#x27;t be cleaned out.</li>
    <li> This razor is worth every penny!I received a sample in a promotional campaign and after the first use, I went out and bought 4 packs at the store because I wanted to make sure I don&#x27;t run out of them any time soon. Great shave, no burn, and smooth skin all day &amp; night long</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a fairly large growth area for facial hair. There is no noticeable transition from my chest hair to my neckline. Growth continues upward to the top of my cheekbones, just below my eyes. My dark hair is coarse, fast-growing, and provides a stark contrast to slightly olive toned skin. This requires that I shave far more often than I would prefer. I try to maintain some style of goatee... but this still leaves &gt;75% area to shave. Luckily, I work at a place where I can get away with 1-2 days of stubble, so I tend to shave on Mon/Wed/Fri... still more than I would prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider myself an armchair expert on shaving devices and creams. For the past 2+ years, I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion 5-blade disposable razor. In conjunction with my favorite cream (Pacific Shaving Co.), I&#x27;d achieved the best shave possible with the available products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I write about these products so often, I recently received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor to try. I don&#x27;t consider myself to have really sensitive skin... but then again, I do avoid shaving every day. When I do shave more than 1 day in a row, I really feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidentally, I was able to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide on a Tues where I had a work presentation to deliver. I really wanted to avoid nicks. I have got to tell you that the Fusion ProGlide razor was at least 2x smoother than the regular Fusion cartridge. I usually have some considerable \\&quot;drag\\&quot; to my shaving, but this cut like a hot knife through butter. I can see getting a few extra days from these blades than the previous version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating is A++ for the Fusion ProGlide razor cartridge.</li>
    <li> My favorite razor for  The Fusion ProGlide came to me as part of a program sponsored by Gillette, and I wasn&#x27;t about to turn down a free razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say the the Fusion ProGlide gave a better, closer shave than my favorite daily  razor(also a Gillette), but it did make shaving easier and faster than I have experienced with similar razors, which is always nice.  A great addition was the aloe strip.  It definitely gives an effortless, superior shave</li>
    <li> I got a free cartridge through a program run by gillete.  I thought at first that it was going to be like other razors i have had, having to go back over my shave one more time, but it wasn&#x27;t I went over once and even the trouble spots were good to go my only concern is how pricey these blades are.</li>
    <li> I used these blades for the first time this morning and let me tell you, they are great. I hadn&#x27;t shaved in about a week and was a little Leary about how comfortable they were going to be. They cut my facial hair like a hot knife through butter. I will definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from gillette. I apperciate getting this product to review. Its nice and sharp and cuts my hair nice and easy. I had a smooth shave. My skin on my chin is very easy to cut and it didnt get any cuts or bruises on my skin. These are the best blades on a razor. I gave this razor five stars because it is simply the best. I will be a customer for life. keep up the good work</li>
    <li> What business does a guy with a beard have with a razor?  Plenty.  I need a good razor that can \\&quot;edge\\&quot; as well as \\&quot;mow.\\&quot;  Rather than shaving once a day, I tend to shave closer to once a week, trimming up the edges of my beard along my neck and cheeks.  I prefer a razor for this over a trimmer because I feel it cuts closer and gives me more control.  When Gillette offered an opportunity to try out the Fusion ProGlide razor for free, I signed up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking it over, the cartridge was a bit more compact that my current razor, and the distance between the blades was less.  I expected this to impair its ability to cut through dense \\&quot;neck beard,\\&quot; but it cut right through it without tugging or pulling.  On the back of the cartridge was a single blade for details.  Having used it for a couple of shaves, I find that the compact size of the cartridge makes it much easier to navigate than my current razor.  As for its ability to trim, the single blade on the back is excellent.  I actually used it to clean up my unibrow situation this morning.  It&#x27;s really easy to flip from shave to trim and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely give it a look the next time I shop for razor blades!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve traditionally used the Mach 3 razor as my go-to razor but decided to try out the Fusion Proglide... Amazing!!! There is an extra razor on the blade so you get an even closer shave plus the moisturizer strip at the top definitely beats any other razor I&#x27;ve tried. I also noticed the gaps between the razors are a bit larger so my stubble doen&#x27;t clog it up, makes it a lot easier to rinse and reuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great razor for edging up or a full shave.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide for free from Gillette to review. I use a Gillette Fusion for my regular shaves, and I was interested in seeing how much better the ProGlide is. After a few shaves, I noticed that it was a bit easier to shave using the ProGlide cartridge. I can get the same results with fewer passes from the ProGlide over the regular Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another minor improvement is in the precision trimmer. The Fusion trimmer had problems with some thicker/longer hair while the ProGlide trimmer does a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On its own, the ProGlide cartridge is a solid razor, giving a close shave without much hassle. When comparing it to the standard Fusion cartridge, I&#x27;m not sure that I would pay much extra for the upgrade.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide blade cartridge through a free program being run by Gillette. Let me start by saying that I am NOT a fan of most manual razors! The ProGlide cartridges have changed my attitude. These are the BEST blades I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried them all)! Like the name says, the blade truly does glide across your skin. I don&#x27;t nick myself and I don&#x27;t get any razor burn. And whether you shave every day or every four days, you still get a close clean shave every time. These blades also last forever! With other blades I literally had to use a new blade every third or fourth shave. With the ProGlide, I&#x27;ve been using the same blade for three weeks and it still feels as sharp as day one. The only problem with the razor? My wife loves it too! Looks like I&#x27;ll be buying another ProGlide!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long been a used of the Gillette Fusion series, but this was the first time I have used the ProGlide blades. I was quite surprised how much better it was than the current Fusion I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allow me to say I&#x27;m not a daily shaver. Sometimes it&#x27;s a day or two, other times it&#x27;s a week. So I really test blades with different types of \\&quot;terrain\\&quot; for the shave. These blades passed with flying colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was smooth and went through a few different lengths of whiskers. I actually found I got through the shave a bit faster than the previous Fusion I used. These blades also made me think I may need to consider moving up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really liked was when going over the jawbone (and chin), it was smooth and didn&#x27;t get caught up. I shave somewhat fast, so I&#x27;m always worried about nicking myself. These blades worked out well for not doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it&#x27;s one of the best razors I&#x27;ve used. I can&#x27;t give it a perfect score as I haven&#x27;t used it enough to know how long or how many shaves the blades last. But it&#x27;s a razor that gets very high marks from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge via a program ran by Gillette. The cartridge did a fine job shaving my face and it left little to no irritation - something that most razors do cause me. I&#x27;ve used the cartridge a few times since I&#x27;ve received it and it&#x27;s already getting dull, which worries me due to the cost. The precision trimmer did an okay job. I used it to trim my sideburns, which took a few strokes, and the hair below my noise. It isn&#x27;t something that I was overly excited about and not sure if it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I have been a Gillette customer for about 13 years. I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide 5 blade razor provided by a program run by Gillette. I was impressed with the 5 blade design. The blades glided smoothly over the contours of my face. I have sensitive skin and the ProGlide irritated me a lot less then prior razors.</li>
    <li> I was provided this free razor by a program run by Gillette and it worked great! It provided a smooth shave and no razor bumps! I think the trimmer blade can use some work, it does not trim as smoothly as I would like it to but overall, a really great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other blades and I must say that this blow them out of the water. I was able to get these free provided via a program run by Gillette and I have to thank them. I&#x27;m a person that gets a lot of razor bumps after shaving and I found out after using these it has to have been the blades I&#x27;ve been using, because my face has never been smoother. These are def an A+ in my book for sure.</li>
    <li> I was allowed the opportunity to participate in sampling the product Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge before purchasing via a program run by Gillette. Overall I was pleasantly surprised on how close and smooth the shave was.  I have sensitive skin and coarse hair, getting a clean close shave was easy.  However, the blade dulls quickly.</li>
    <li> Blade gives a close, smooth shave. The lubricating strips reduce drag. I would definetely purchase this product again. I recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> After I got a free razor and cartridge from Gillette as part of a promotion, I wanted to compare their blades to my usual razor, the Mach 3. I immediately noticed the larger lube strip on the ProGlide blade, and enjoyed how smoothly the blades felt against my face. The shave was closer with less irritation than using the Mach 3, probably because of the thinner blades, as well as the additional blades (5 vs 3 from the Mach) and the larger lube strip</li>
    <li> I got a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette, now this is the only razor I will use. I use this razor every day and have zero irritation. I get a clean shave with no missed hairs. The blades last me almost two weeks before I have to change them so the price is not really an issue since a 4 pack will last about a month.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a two weeks now. I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide as a free trial through the company. I have been using this for a couple weeks now and the main thing I love about this razor is how great it is to use in the shower! The grip design on this razor makes it very easy to hold in the shower. After work before I go out for the night I take a quick shower and like to do a quick touch up, the grip of this razor doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands and helps you have a greater control</li>
    <li> I received these blades through a program run by Gillette and I gladly accepted the opportunity to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Gillette blades in the past and they have never failed to leave me with an excellent shave, but recently I started to shave my head and even my best razor was leaving the back of my neck very irritated. I was told that overtime I would get used to it and that the red bumps would subside, but after trying these blades I have never had a shave that left my neck irritated. For this reason alone I highly recommend these blades for people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin I would still recommend these blades because it leaves you with a remarkably close shave every time. Also the Lubrastrip on these blades also seem to last for much longer than any other blades I&#x27;ve used in the past. My prior blades would lose the strip after only a couple weeks of shaving, whether it would just wear down or fall right off. This one though is still going strong after 4 weeks of shaving every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to sum it all up, Buy these blades, I know I&#x27;ll be purchasing more when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide was a very good razor that did not leave any burn. The only issue was that the attachments were kind of weak. I forced one on and the razor and snapped the plastic piece. Other then that a good quality tool. I got this this razor free through a Gillette program</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette fusion proglide razor through a program ran bu the gillette Company it was the best thing i have ever done. i love how close of a shave you get with this razor leaves you with a smooth feeling skin i am definetely changing razors.</li>
    <li> My husband received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual cartridge for free from a program run by Gillette. He says: \\&quot;I really like how close the shave is and how comfortable it is to use the blades. It is now my favorite razor.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was provided a free razor via a program run by Gillette. I like the Gillette Fusion Proglide manual cartridge because it gives me a close, comfortable shave. I also really like the one blade precision aspect because it helps me align my beard easily. The smoothness of my face lasts longer than other razors I&#x27;ve tried previously. The only downside about the Proglide cartridge is that it seems to become dull by the third shave, though that could be because my beard grows very thick and fast. I would definitely recommend this razor because overall, it gives you a great shave.</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette Fusion free from a Gillette promotion and was extremely satisfied. I now purchase them regularly and get a soft smooth shave every time! I have sensitive skin and these blades were awesome in my skin.</li>
    <li> This razor was given to me for free by a company sponsored by Gillette. I absolutely love this razor. I will not use any other razor because with all the other brands I found myself spending more time shaving the same spot repeatedly to get the result I wanted (Close shave). With Gillette Fusion Proglide only one stroke gives me that close smooth shave without giving me razor burns or the bumps. I&#x27;m surprised how affordable it is. I highly recommend this razor for all your grooming needs. I even let my wife use my razor to shave her legs just to cut back the time she would have been wasting in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try out the new Fusion Proglide blades since I didnt think they would be much different from the standard Fusion blades.  I received it to try out for free in a program by Gillette and have to say that I was pretty pleased.  I have sensitive skin and the Proglide blades seemed to provide a markedly improved shave over the standard Fusion blades.  They also seemed to get the hairs normally missed.  At first I thought, due to the smooth run of the blade, that it wasn&#x27;t cutting, but it was just actually that smooth.  I do think the blades may not last as long since they seem finer but they have yet to dull, so maybe they will last just as long as the standard Fusion blades.  Overall a great shave and worth the price, especially if you have sensitive skin or fine hairs.</li>
    <li> The Pro glide Cartridge is an okay razor. Due to skin sensitivity issue I shave using only water, using no shaving cream. That said I am very picky when it comes to my razor choices. I tried the Pro Glide and found two things. 1. The lubrication strip does not offer much to someone not using shaving cream. 2 the blades though sharp and gave me a pretty good shave, only lasted a couple shaves before it became irritating and felt like the blade were pulling hair instead of cutting. Though I can&#x27;t say how the use of shaving cream would affect this, I can say I was decently satisfied with the shave i got from it outside of the two issues.</li>
    <li> i recived this free from gillette to try they worked very well if price was not a factor i would highly recommend them but i would not say the out preform there competitors who are priced a little more reasonably but they did work well</li>
    <li> A free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette, I figured why not? These blades may be costly but they give a very smooth shave. If you don&#x27;t leave them sitting in a pool of water, they will last a long time. I will definitely buy these as the quality is outstanding!</li>
    <li> I received this as a free preview from Gillette. I was very impressed by this razor. The blades held up through my shave and the blades lasted me a few days longer than my razor I was using at the time. I would highly recommend this razor and plan on trashing my other razor and just use this one. The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor is a must have. And it&#x27;s great for on the go. I pack it in my overnight bag and it&#x27;s travel friendly.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive the Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridges through free program offered by Gillette. I am a fan of Gillette, and I continue to support their products after giving these cartridges a try.  I continue to get that smooth shave, without having to suffer through the sometimes inevitable cuts and bumps.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Upon using the Gillete Pro Fusion razor that I received for free from a program run by Gillette, I was a little skeptical. I must admit that I was rather foolish in making this assumption. I am an avid user of the Shick Quattro razor and never thought I would use a different razor. Let me tell you, I received just as close of a shave as my currently used razor. The razors glide smoothly over you skin getting as close as possible to the cleanest shave you can get. I haven&#x27;t looked in to pricing yet but that will be the sole decider on which razor I will use in the future!</li>
    <li> Not a bad razor on the first few uses but dulled quickly after.  The hydrating strip also went quickly. I have experienced longer sharpness from an average disposable. I would not purchase this razor in the future.</li>
    <li> Well I must say I was very skeptical about this Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor as I always used disposable razors. I got this razor thru a program run by Gillette and let me tell you no more disposables. I&#x27;ve used this razor  almost every day for 2 weeks and still works like the first day. I shave in the shower and use the Gillette shave gel. I have sensitive skin and this razor blade has not been a problem. This razor blade is great and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular fusion blades for a few years now and love them. I recently received a free ProGlide blade through a Gillette program. Its a great razor that provides a close, smooth shave that&#x27;s much better then the schick hydro 5 blade. I especially like the single blade on the back for fine details under my nose. While this is a great razor, I really don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between the ProGlide and the normal fusion. Because of this I&#x27;m going to stick to buying the normal fusion and not spending the extra money on the ProGlide.</li>
    <li> i recently received this free razor via a special program ran by Gillette and i can say this razor is definitely worth it. this gave me the closest shave without giving me bumps or rashes. i recommend this product</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Cartridge via Gillette&#x27;s program. I tried it out and I must say the blazes are my face new best friend. The great thing about these cartridges is the fact it can be used with all fusion handles. The thinner, finer blades glide so smoothly on my face giving me that perfect, precision shave. Gillette really out did themselves with their advancement of the blades technology. Most importantly, the blades last longer than other leading razor cartridge out there on the market. So yeah, I would definitely recommend this to my those professional and average men out there whose looking for the perfect shave.</li>
    <li> Still one of the best and closet shaves I can get! Have used Gillette products in the past and have always been a fan. They used to be out of my price range and I would be stuck buying 3rd party or knock of brands that would always not get close enough or leave nicks on my face making shaving uncomfortable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a few years since I used the Fusion ProGlide but recently received a sample razor via a program by Gillette and instantly remembered why I used them and kicked myself for stopping! The best part about buying them on Amazon is they come right to my doorstep and they&#x27;re a good 5-10 dollars cheaper than at the local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now an important part of about getting a good shave has to do with the shaving cream you use, but I&#x27;m certain that with the Fusion ProGlide blade you will get a good shave regardless!</li>
    <li> For a few years mostly for money reasons I&#x27;ve used another brand but when I recently got the opportunity to try a proglide razor it really made me think twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thin blades are great. I&#x27;ve noticed having to make less strokes of the razor and haven&#x27;t noticed it pulling my hair or skin once. Less strokes also means less irritation and for me that&#x27;s a very big thing. I have thick hair so the easier it is to shave the better. The razor also has a Comfortably designed handle.</li>
    <li> The free Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge was provided via a program run by Gillette. I think that as far as manual razors go, it worked well providing a close shave. The cartridges are easy to install and remove, easy to rinse. However, given the price of replacing the cartridges between the manual and the power glider, I would choose the Power Glider.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor like crazy since I got it (for free, from Gillette, by the way. :) ). I am a head and (sometimes) face shaver, so in addition to looking for a smooth and comfortable shave, I also look for durability and longevity in my razors. Compared with other brands, this razor easily takes the cake in all four of those categories. I got the razor well over a month ago, and am still using the same cartridge that came with the handle.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion pro glide is the best razor yet. Let me start off by saying 5 super thin blades gets super close to the skin. The shave is comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t feel like your pulling the hair out of your skin. The handle is also very comfortable and is designed to have allot of control. The only drawback with this razor is it doesn&#x27;t last long. After a few shaves i find myself having to change the super expensive blades. I guess all good things have you have some sort of drawback. :)I lastly like to point out i received this razor Free from a program run by Gillette. I do intend to continue using this razor as i really like it. Even with the super expensive blades.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these blades. I am able to get a great close shave and use them multiple times. Every time I get a nice shave. I could not be happier with them.</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Proglide for free through a advertisement program by gillette. I am very pleased with the results. The blades last a long time, there great for sensitive skin. I will be purchasing more in the future while they are not cheap I believe that the quality and experience that they provide me with are worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I recently received a a Gillette Fusion Manual Razor, through a promotion with Gillette and I love it. After my first shave it left my skin feeling so smooth. I had no irritation whatsoever, and that&#x27;s a big deal for me. I have very sensitive skin, with most razors I end up with razor burn or bumps. I&#x27;m pleased with how sharp the blades are, even after shaving for a week. With other razor I have had, in my experience the blades wear after only a few shaves, with the sharpness of these blades I no longer have to worry about that. I have to say that regardless of all the other fancy razors, this is by far my favorite. The sleek design and rubber grip are perfect, I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> i loove the fact that i can shave my head with out any knicks  or leaving patches behind every one loves a smooth head</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide to try for free from a Gillette program.  The blades are advanced.  They are thinner and finer than the Fusion.  This helps to provide a sleek glide over the skin without pulling.  The outcome is soft, smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Best razor blades i ever buy.... cheap and the best shave ever andlas longer than other brands... there is no way to change it for other brand...</li>
    <li> It gets the job done if you want a real close shave. But if you have really thick facial hair, I would trim it first, then use these blades, otherwise, you would risk the blades becoming dull.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide to try for free via a program by Gillette. I am not one to shave every day, so I was skeptical as to how well the blades would work on three or four day growth. I was honestly surprised to see they made fairly quick work of the stubble. The blades did not clog up like a lot of razors do. A quick run through the water and they were clean again. I used this blade several times without them becoming dull. My face is sensitive and the blades did not irritate them at all. This cartridge has a single blade design on the end to allow for shaping of sideburns or anything else. It really helped to make sure they were square without any layering from the multiple blade layout. The only thing I do not like about it is when you use the single blade, it wobbles just a little until it makes contact with your skin. Overall, I would most definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> First I want to say I was provided a free razor and blade to try by a program run by Gillette. Now on to my review, I think the blade did  a very good job compared to other razors I have used. When I was done my shave seemed closer than most razors. I definetly think I will be switching to this blade.</li>
    <li> I got to try this produce for free from bzzagent.com. When I got it I was super excited to try it my wife and I read over the stuff the product had and got even more excited about trying it. The thing I thought was pretty cool about this razor was that it has the little touch up razor on the flip. I wouldn&#x27;t have even noticed it though if I hadn&#x27;t read the packaging. I love this razor it has replace the one I was using before!</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me the Proglide cartridges in a promotion they&#x27;re running. I&#x27;ve been shaving with the Gillette fusion for a while now. I&#x27;ve always gotten a clean shave with little resistance especially if I showered before my shave.  I cannot believe the difference! I have never had a smoother face. Granted I don&#x27;t have the thickest stubble I still have always felt a roughness after shaving and the Proglide cartridges eliminate any hair whatsoever. They do wear out slightly quicker than the fusion blades (i probably get a week out of mine)but it honestly doesn&#x27;t bother me that much for the difference in feel.</li>
    <li> I received the razor free from a program run by Gillette.  I use this product usually everyday and this razor is great. While many others would cut me and/or leave razor burn this one didn&#x27;t do either.  I really like this razor and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this free razor through a program from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using  Gillette Fusion ProGlide POWER for the last year, but I&#x27;m going to switch to this regular razor because I like the feel - a little heavier feels better in the hand and gives more control.</li>
    <li> very nice blades, gives u a smooth and close shave. i highly recommend this product to the everyday shaaver. gillette always makes a good product.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free through a program run through Gillette. I was skeptical at first, because I am attached to the razor I currently use. Upon receiving the Gillette Fusion ProGlide, I was amazed at how close of a shave I got! My other razor got close, but always seemed to leave a little bit of stubble still there. The trimmer was a nice touch as well.</li>
    <li> I received the Gilete Fusion Proglide cartridge for free via a program run by Gilette. One of the better shaves I&#x27;ve gotten out of a disposable razor blade. I recommend this to anyone looking to make a switch from their current razor. Zero razor burn, and shaves down to the root. I even use it to shave my head, and it&#x27;s smooth. I only shave every other day due to sensitive skin, and this blade does such a good job no one can tell.</li>
    <li> I was recently given a free Gillette Fusion Proglide via a program run by Gillette. I already have a Gillette fusion razor that I regularly use, but I was happy to try out there new product. I&#x27;ve had bought Gillette razors since I first began shaving and I must say that I am extremely happy with this product. I found that it was very easy to handle and control, thanks to the new ergonomic side grips. The shave itself was great. Very smooth, and literally glided along my face as it said it would. I also didn&#x27;t have any razor bumps the next day which was nice and abnormal, so I have to attribute it to the razor&#x27;s thinner blades and larger lubricated strip. All and all I am very happy with this product and a big thanks goes out to Gillette for allowing me to try it. Based on my experience, I will continue to use this razor from here on out and would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.</li>
    <li> The purpose of a razor is to provide an easy clean shave, and this has done so. Not an expensive product that you can carry anywhere you go. The only flaw is that my skin is sensitive and I have to be very careful that it will not cut me. In the end this product is sleek and fits nicely in hand that provides what is advertise.</li>
    <li> First off, I should tell you that I received this razor via a free program run by Gillette. Now on to my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very course beard hair and tend to shred the moisture strips on most razors in the first use. Though the strip did lose some moisture, it has stood the test of time over a number of uses, which I appreciate. The shave is a good close shave that I can&#x27;t complain about, comparable to the shave I&#x27;ve had from other razors. I also like the trimming blade on the back for the tricky spots, though it isn&#x27;t always the easiest to use.</li>
    <li> I had been using disposable razors for along time. I always thought that a razor was just a razor, and was worried more about the expense of good razors than the comfort and quality of the shave itself. Oh how I was wrong. The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor showed me how awesome a good quality razor can be. I probably would not have ever tried this razor if I had not received one from a program Gillette had been running. Let me tell you, the shave that this razor gives is very comfortable. There is absolutely no tugging,pulling or razor burn. The back of the razor is even open so I could rinse out the hair that gets stuck in between the blades from time to time.(very nice feature) It even has a single blade on the top for some quick edging. I thought this would tear up my face but it too was smooth and effortless. I have been using the same Fusion Proglide cartridge for almost a month now and it is still shaving like I just took it out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I will no longer be buying the disposable razors, and I highly recommend trying out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Cartridge.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s very very favorite and he uses it on his head, face, arms...; prefers over any other razor so we have a subscription.</li>
    <li> The blades are fine. My only problem is with pricing of razor blades in general. They just seem to be to expensive for what you get.</li>
