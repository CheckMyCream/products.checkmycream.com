      <li>Honestly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice color.</li>
      <li>:) I had to restyle/cut the bangs quite a bit, to avoid showing the hairline of the wigcap, but after a bit of refashioning, I was very pleased.</li>

      <li>It also styles very easily.</li>

      <li>Love love love!</li>
      <li>i was beautiful, and it was even more pretty than in the picture.</li>
      <li>It is good in length, but SUPER shiny, not like pictured.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a grey/ silver.</li>
      <li>Seriously, my favorite wig.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>#34;this is a wig&amp;#34; way many of them are made.</li>
      <li>otherwise I love it</li>
      <li>The bangs are awesome, but in the back you can see the netting where hair is sewn on no matter how you style it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love the wig and how it looks on me.</li>
      <li>This picture looks way better than how the wig arrived to me in the mail.</li>
      <li>It was the best one I could find, but was reluctant to order it because of the long estimated shipping time.  </li>
      <li>I opened it up, it was in pretty good condition.</li>
      <li>I love the wig it is the color on the picture and easy to comb.  </li>
      <li>I was able to easily pull it into a side ponytail without it tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I am extremely happy that it arrived early!</li>
      <li>I purchased this wig for Halloween and it looks cheap and also a bit more gray in person.</li>
      <li>I would recommend buying this if you are a true cosplayer!</li>
      <li>The bangs were longer than I wanted but scissors can easily fix that.  </li>
      <li>I also appreciated the nice free gift as well.</li>
      <li>Shockingly cheap for what you get.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>It has the clips in the inside to size it to fit and make it snug.</li>
      <li>and I feel it was more than worth it for the price.</li>
      <li>Wow for the price I can&#x27;t believe how good the quality is.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>Good wig not thin and can be hot curled on medium setting heat.</li>
      <li>The hair is very soft and the wig is nice and full, can&#x27;t see the tracks easily.</li>
      <li>I just smile and tell them I&#x27;m taking a day off from being queen!</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>And the curls are loose waves and just is great all-in-all</li>
      <li>super silky soft and straightens very well, it also comes with a wig cap which is super handy!</li>
      <li>Came fairly quickly, the estimated arrival date was the 25th, got it today.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Very gray and can see the cap easily through it.</li>
      <li>so I needed a nice white wig.</li>
      <li>I wound up having to buy a different wig because this one looked more grandma than storm from Xmen which was the look I was originally going for.</li>
      <li>It may be my new favorite wig I own actually because to me, the two things I stated as negatives are really not important to me and overall, I would say for the price you are paying this is an excellent wig.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good, arrived way after the other items I ordered but within the time they said.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine for my purposes, but it would have been nice if it were just a little thicker.</li>
      <li>A lot grayer in person than it appears in the picture, but other than that, a pretty good quality wig.</li>
      <li>The wig does run a bit thin at the top, but if you take good care of it-</li>
      <li>This wig can handle light heat well and is very soft...</li>
      <li>However I tried to use my chi straightener on it and it burned the hair off however on a low setting the wig would be fine !</li>
      <li>not the best wig but not the worst, feels really nice and easy to style.</li>
      <li>The wig was a bit little but it still looked good.</li>
      <li>I had to trim the bangs a little because they were too long but otherwise perfect.</li>
      <li>,I brushed through this and did not shed AT ALL my ebay wig would shed a TON (still love them though</li>
      <li>Not only that, its much more gray than the photo.  </li>
      <li>It looks more silver than white.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it if you are trying to look sexy for your significant other.</li>
      <li>Long and surprisingly full for a cheapie fun wig!</li>
      <li>It was more of a grey color and was curly!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This wigs is beautiful..But it sheds ALOT!!&lt;br /&gt;It super silky soft and straightens very well, it also comes with a wig cap which is super handy!</li>
    <li> Long and surprisingly full for a cheapie fun wig! If you need a wig for a costume party or something, this is perfect. It covered my entire head just fine with no &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34; spots. Took a little finessing, but I managed to get the bangs adjusted and out of my face. Very long and thick, considering how cheap it was!</li>
    <li> This wig looks just as pictured.  I ordered the silver one for my storm costume.  It was the best one I could find, but was reluctant to order it because of the long estimated shipping time.  I ordered it on 10-20-13.  The estimated delivery date was Nov 14-Dec 3.  The reviews said it arrived sooner than expected so I gave it  shot.  It arrived on 10-28-13 in time for Halloween!  I am SUPER happy!  My only gripe, &amp; it&#x27;s minor, is that the netting is yellowish instead of white. There&#x27;s enough hair to fill that in though.</li>
    <li> Great wig. I ordered it for Halloween. The hair is very soft and flowy. I had to trim the bangs a little because they were too long but otherwise perfect. Also it arrived within a few days!</li>
    <li> I have little faith in it being heat resistant, but it is a nice- decent wig. I&#x27;m using it for a Fem Sasaki Haise so... the fact that you can see the cap under the thin layers at the top isn&#x27;t such a bad thing for me since it will be painted black.</li>
    <li> Doesnt look quite like it does in photos but all in all good product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig for Halloween and it looks cheap and also a bit more gray in person. I wound up having to buy a different wig because this one looked more grandma than storm from Xmen which was the look I was originally going for. This picture looks way better than how the wig arrived to me in the mail. Disappointed in this purchase for sure.</li>
    <li> Seriously, my favorite wig. I wear it way too much.</li>
    <li> Very gray and can see the cap easily through it. Very thin.</li>
    <li> I love this wig! I wear it out sometimes when I&#x27;m having a bad hair day... always makes me smile when some little girl thinks I&#x27;m Elsa. I just smile and tell them I&#x27;m taking a day off from being queen! Good quality... doesn&#x27;t look fake when you are wearing it. Get a lot of compliments. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> My fiance looked hott in this on New Years Eve! We went to an all white party so she got this wig. Looked really good! I highly recommend it if you are trying to look sexy for your significant other. He will like it for sure!</li>
    <li> This wig is very soft and beautiful, but it was extremely thin. I had to buy some loose wefts from another supplier to fill in the gaps</li>
    <li> The product did not take as long as it says.  It took 6 business days to arrive.  I love the wig it is the color on the picture and easy to comb.  The bangs were longer than I wanted but scissors can easily fix that.  I can&#x27;t wait to wear this wig for Halloween.</li>
    <li> I have purchased synthetic wigs from amazon, but not from this company before. I was very impressed with how quickly it arrived, as it came almost a month before predicted! I also appreciated the nice free gift as well. However, the wig looks nothing like the picture. I purchased the silvery white wig. It is good in length, but SUPER shiny, not like pictured. It is also stark bright white, with no silver hues. It does shed a lot, and is a bit thin. I suppose for the price you can not expect too much, but the wigs I have ordered in the past for the same cost were way more like the wigs pictured on the site.</li>
    <li> i loved it!! i was beautiful, and it was even more pretty than in the picture. The wig was a bit little but it still looked good. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Just a tad thin at the skull, fixable with some combing. I love to wear hats so it is a very minor issue for me. The hair itself is high quality. Feels very realistic and soft, not like straw or plastic. Being long and flowing I was concerned with how it would move, these worries proved unfounded. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly nice for the cost. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I used it for my Ursula cosplay and it was great!</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a dark elf cosplay I am planning on wearing for Ren Faire later this month. I didn&#x27;t expect much because it was coming from China and the price was on the cheaper side for a wig. After I ordered it, I was crushed to discovered that the delivery date was after the date I was planning on using it for. However, it was a wonderful surprise that it showed up yesterday (a week ahead of the estimated delivery date!) So I am extremely happy that it arrived early! It was also a wonderful surprise that it arrived with a wig cap, which I was not expecting. Those were major bonuses in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened it up, it was in pretty good condition. The wig itself was a little darker than what I expected it to be, but thats alright. I expected the wig to be a snow white color, but it was more of silvery white. It still looks wonderful on though and will be perfect for the cosplay I am planning on using it for. It also styles very easily. I was able to easily pull it into a side ponytail without it tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only two real negatives about this wig is that it does shed easily (before I even styled it, it started to shed) and it is a little thinner than what I expected. the only reason I expected it to be fuller was because I ordered a similar wig in red and it was very full. This one has noticeably less volume to it, but it&#x27;s really not a big deal because you cant see the cap underneath the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am really happy with this purchase. I love the wig and how it looks on me. It may be my new favorite wig I own actually because to me, the two things I stated as negatives are really not important to me and overall, I would say for the price you are paying this is an excellent wig. I am really excited to wear this for my dark elf cosplay and other future cosplays because it seriously looks wonderful on.</li>
    <li> Very nice color. Simple enough, though not as thick as others I have, but it is still covering. Good price too.</li>
    <li> It can be quite tricky to find silver or white wigs that aren&#x27;t TOO bright - too much shine is a dead giveaway. This is the perfect color though. The waves are big and loose enough to brush through easily, without losing a lot of hair. And the weight is nice - heavy enough to feel secure, but not too heavy as to feel burdening. Most of all, I just can&#x27;t get over the color! :) I had to restyle/cut the bangs quite a bit, to avoid showing the hairline of the wigcap, but after a bit of refashioning, I was very pleased. Great buy. :)</li>
    <li> This wig is gray don&#x27;t buy it, its not at all what I had expected. The quality isn&#x27;t that good either.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome wig. Really soft and looks real. Great for cosplay. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love love love! Wow for the price I can&#x27;t believe how good the quality is. And the curls are loose waves and just is great all-in-all</li>
    <li> A lot grayer in person than it appears in the picture, but other than that, a pretty good quality wig.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy it. not the best wig but not the worst, feels really nice and easy to style. does its job quite well</li>
    <li> a lot of strangers gave me compliments when I wore it, looks very natural. but I wore it with a hat.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased and after a few YouTube tutorials, I was able to get this on without looking like an insane person, and not only do I not look like an insane person, I look pretty good. I don&#x27;t have enough experience to compare the quality to that of other wigs, but I believe I paid $6-something for this and I feel it was more than worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> Good wig not thin and can be hot curled on medium setting heat. It looked like the picture! Good quality for price.</li>
    <li> My blonde wig came WAY early,an entire MONTH early infact very pleased!first wig I&#x27;ve gotten off amazon,I brushed through this and did not shed AT ALL my ebay wig would shed a TON (still love them though and they were way too thick). The only thing that bummed me out,but it wasn&#x27;t a bad thing,my shipping info didn&#x27;t tell me it was even close to being here,but hey!no biggie! over all the shipping and quality is amazing.</li>
    <li> Came fairly quickly, the estimated arrival date was the 25th, got it today. It&#x27;s super thin, and I think if i wear it out, it&#x27;ll need a hat. you can see the wig mesh underneath and you can feel where the wefts were sewn on in the back. it&#x27;s fine for my purposes, but it would have been nice if it were just a little thicker. it&#x27;s a lovely blueish silver, which is a color I&#x27;ve been unable to get my hair to thanks to having reddish brown hair. overall, I might try one of the other wigs that reviewers say are thicker.</li>
    <li> Buy it. You won&#x27;t be sorry. I actually purchased two wigs bc I thought I wouldn&#x27;t get this in time for my party but this hair is really soft it moves and is not heavy feeling. Diffinantly the best quality his far in prop wear...or whatever!  Lol</li>
    <li> This wig can handle light heat well and is very soft...the only downside to it is that it&#x27;s a little thin...otherwise I love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more of a grey/ silver. Good wig but not the color I thought I was getting</li>
    <li> Very happy with the quality. Am buying another as a gift.</li>
    <li> Love this wig! I bought it for Halloween, and now I&#x27;m thinking of wearing in a night out.</li>
    <li> It makes my head look enormous I guess.</li>
    <li> It is full and pretty, but much darker than expected.  It looks more silver than white.  I like it though and it will work with my costume well.  It has the clips in the inside to size it to fit and make it snug.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a halloween costume.  I ordered it on sept. 30th, and I didn&#x27;t even get it in time.  It took forever.  Not only that, its much more gray than the photo.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> The hair is very soft and the wig is nice and full, can&#x27;t see the tracks easily. My only complaint is that it constantly flops into my eyes and is hard to see out of, I feel like Shaggy-do with it on. Other than that this is a much nicer wig than I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> This was so much better quality than expected. Shockingly cheap for what you get. Beautiful hair, heat resistant and a very true silver color. People kept asking how I got my hair that color. Honestly. The bang are also cut like a real haircut and not that weird &amp;#34;this is a wig&amp;#34; way many of them are made. Comes curled perfectly. Note - although high quality for the price, brush it very gently or pieces will come out.</li>
    <li> My wig came in several days early. I was very pleased with the packaging, it came in an envelope inside a box...it was not tangled when I put it on, it also came with a hair net. I&#x27;m cosplaying as genderbent Kaneki Ken for Dragoncon  so I needed a nice white wig.I did have to cut the bangs a bit, but other than that- I love it. The wig does run a bit thin at the top, but if you take good care of it- that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem!</li>
    <li> long silky soft . you can see the wig cap through the hair though so you cant play with the style to much. I wear it with most to all of the hair fw because the wig slips backward/off real easy if I don&#x27;t have it bobby pinned.</li>
    <li> I got this for an Ashe from League of Legends cosplay and it worked great! Though it did shed more than the average wig...</li>
    <li> Awesome wig. Exactly what ted and expected. Great job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful wig it comes nicely packaged and actually came a few weeks early ! However I tried to use my chi straightener on it and it burned the hair off however on a low setting the wig would be fine !</li>
    <li> Not as silvery bold as I anticipated but not returning because it&#x27;s a great price and it came in a timely matter.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Actually bought for my daughter, her comments were: &amp;#34;A little bit thin, but it works for what I need it for. It&#x27;s good, arrived way after the other items I ordered but within the time they said.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Completely disappointing product. I anticipated the long wait for delivery, but wig I received was COMPLETELY different than the image. It was more of a grey color and was curly! Fool me once, shame on you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice color. The hair is soft and workable. The length is not as pictured, it&#x27;s just below shoulders and it&#x27;s very thin. The bangs are awesome, but in the back you can see the netting where hair is sewn on no matter how you style it. Not sure how you&#x27;d use this, unless you wore a hat.</li>
    <li> I have no regrets! The wig is nice and matches the picture perfectly. It also comes with a Hair net which is very helpful. I would recommend buying this if you are a true cosplayer!</li>
