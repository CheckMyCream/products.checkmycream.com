<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tested the item and it is very good, not too small and not too big just about right in size and the product is good looking.</li>
    <li> It is nice and well made.  It is expensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the finest nail clippers ever!</li>
    <li> Thoroughly impressed with the Clyppi toenail clipper. How well the product worked was amazing. You made an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I love the quality and fast shipment.</li>
    <li> I have aerhritis in hands I highly recommend these clippers .</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the clippers.  They are very sharp and do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the size and weight of the tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malcolm,  NC</li>
    <li> It feels like high-end clipper until you try clipping nails. it is not any better that a clipper from a dollar store. Something is wrong with sharpening or alignment. I expected more for the price. However, is does look like a real thing and it is heavy. It you need it just for decoration, that&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
    <li> Say good bye to rigid, jagged nails thanks to the best nail clippers out there!  After years of using cheap quality nail clippers and toe clippers, I decided to make a change and picked up these Clyppi nail clippers after seeing the reviews.  They are precision sharp nail clippers.  You can feel the quality right out of the box.  I have very hard toe nails that usually look horrible after trimming.  These nail clippers cut my nails in one cut, straight across.  Because of that I my toes looked beach ready for a recent vacation.  My husband who has chronic ingrown toe nails has found that he hasn&#x27;t had any since using these toe nail clippers.  I let go of the baby nail clippers for my two children and just used these because they were more precise and quicker to use.  Because the nails are cut with a quality nail clipper, I have found both my toe and fingernails have been growing in very healthy and manicured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received these nail clippers for the purpose of this review, however this is my personal opinion and it was not influenced in anyway.</li>
    <li> They are good, but not worth the extra money paid for them.  Next time I will just pay the $3 and get a pair from a beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;The clip ok, but are not as fabulous as they claim to be.</li>
    <li> Finally a clipper that cuts the toughest nails!! Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheaper versions- you end up buying several that costs the same as this fine product</li>
    <li> Not very sharp. Liked a previous pair from another company better. Better than the drug store variety, but not by much. I might be too picky.</li>
    <li> good quality  good price  arrived on time</li>
    <li> I like the new clipper! It&#x27;s a well designed product for those who have difficulties with grooming. Finally, a great pair of nail clippers!</li>
    <li> This is the best Toenail clipper.</li>
    <li> nice design, great construction.   love &#x27;em</li>
    <li> Great seller and prompt contact! I bought these clippers for my aging dad to help with his mobility problems. These clippers are big and sturdy and look like they&#x27;ll do the job for many years to come!</li>
    <li> This toenail clippers are simple to use, reasonably priced and work well.</li>
    <li> I have one very thick toenail on each foot. These clippers cut with relative ease. Cuts fingernails just fine also. The only negative is the lack of a blade for cleaning under the nails, for which I have always used my tiny Swiss Army knife; so it is completely adequate for me.</li>
    <li> This clipper was so easy to use, I have arthritis in both of my thumbs and can&#x27;t push very hard on regular clippers. This one was so easy to cut my nail and it cuts so nice and clean. Good nail clipper for anyone!</li>
    <li> Best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> Cuts well but not a comfortable handle to use.</li>
    <li> Not adequate for long tough nails.</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product.</li>
    <li> This toenail clipper does just what it needs to. It&#x27;s sharp and cuts well. It&#x27;s also a fairly sturdy in it&#x27;s construction. I would probably buy it again if I needed another one.</li>
    <li> ell engineered, high quality construction. Clever and convenient imbedded file on the underside of the lever. Dual purpose with finger and toenail in one tool.</li>
    <li> I got these today and I am impressed with how sturdy and well made they are.  Works great and I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I received clippers quickly and packaging was great.These clippers are lightweight and feel comfortable in my hand. The lever transformed smoothly from storage to cut position. I felt that I had to put a little extra pressure on the lever to actually cut my nail and that is the reason for the four star rating.</li>
    <li> I love these toe nail clippers!!  They probably are the strongest clippers I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely thick nails on both my fingers and toes.  So, I can through clippers really fast if they aren&#x27;t well made.  I&#x27;ve even had clippers break while using them.  These clippers truly are really well made, the way they are designed makes it easier to grip and to clip.  The clipper part is really sharp and cuts through even my disgustingly thick toenails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are a polished silver instead of shiny, and to me it makes them more pleasant to the eye.m I just really love the look and feel of the Clyppi toe nail clippers, I&#x27;ve also tried the fingernails clippers and those are just as awesome as the toe nail clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**. I received these at a promo price for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I received these Clyppi Toenail clippers and am totally impressed! These clippers are not your cheesy toenail clippers that you buy at Walmart, these are stainless steel and very sturdy and well made. They are very easy to hold and use. They do not cramp my hands trying to use these. I was chosen to test and review this item, and I&#x27;m glad to give my personal opinions of these toenail clippers. I love the matte finish of these clippers, and the built in nail file, that you cannot see when the clippers are in a closed position. When you open the clippers and twist the top lever, you will see the built in nail file. I do miss the ability to clean out the toenails with the file, but that&#x27;s ok. I will trade that for the strength and precise and smooth cut these clippers have. I prefer the curved cutting versus the straight cuts also. These cute my toenail fast and left my nails smooth. I&#x27;m sure my husband is going to love these on his thick toenails.&lt;br /&gt;The clippers came packaged in little box. I love the lifetime guarantee!</li>
    <li> These are not your typical nail clippers. As soon as I opened these, the grip is what I noticed. The do not slip in your hands like some I have do. These are solid and well designed that really, you can be at almost any angle. They cut very well. In fact, these clippers are sharper than what you may be used to with cheaper brands. In some cases the cut is so easy, you hardly get the clip sound. I highly recommend these. I feel these will last a lifetime!</li>
    <li> These really nice. Stainless steal and very sturdy for think toe nails. Great product!</li>
    <li> I got these Toe Nail Clippers for a great price to review. I was very excited when I got them in my mailbox and I had to put them to a good use right away. I have pretty toenails but like all beautiful things in life these came with a price. It runs in my family that we have thick toe nails and it used to take me use all my energy to cut my toenails with a regular clipper. I have cried many tears and then my husband used to come to come to my rescue to cut the for me.But now I found a right solution for my problems.These clippers are tough and can handle my tough nails very easily. These nail clippers have a pretty good grip and do not slip out of hands easily like the regular old clippers. I got the quickest and cleanest cut ever with out a lot of effort. My toenails used to be really jagged but not any more. I would recommend these clippers to any one that has a situation like mine(I mean thick toe nails). My Mom is not alive any more but she had severe Arthritis , making it impossible to cut her nails and  she would have probably loved this clipper.</li>
    <li> This is a nice size. I have seen bigger toenail clippers before but this is still a decent size. The nail clippers look nice and strong. They cut cleanly. I like using this on both my fingernails and toenails. This nail clipper comes with a little file on the clippers, as well. These feel sturdy and durable and I expect them to last a long time. I received a discount on this product through a promotion. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper.  My husband has horrible toe nails and these are the only pair that has not broke after using the on him.  Definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought both the fingernail and toenail clippers and I love them.  They are well made, have a good feel in my hand and they are strong and sharp.  Now they just have to pass the test of time!</li>
    <li> This clipper is sturdy and made with good craftsmanship.  Looks very professional and does the job quite well. I like it.</li>
    <li> LOVE the CLYPPI Nail Clippers.  They&#x27;re nice and sharp, so they cut cleanly through the nail without leaving a jagged edge or shooting toenails across the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item.  However, this did not influence my review.  All opinions are true and my own.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Clyppi large nail clippers are SO sturdy! So much more so then any of my other clippers I owe. In fact, all my other clippers feel &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; compared to these clyppi clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They feel really great handling them. They have a nice heft but aren&#x27;t too heavy. They are made of high quality Stainless Steel with a matte, brushed steel finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a built in nail file which is super handy. Especially if you are using them for travel.. now you don&#x27;t need to pack two things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are very sharp. Your nails will not split when you are cutting them nor will you need to rip off pieces that won&#x27;t come away with other clippers. You can cut your nails very precisely.  The thumbpad seems to be a little wider then normal clippers so you have more control when pressing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking of hiding these clippers for my own use.. I don&#x27;t want my family losing them!</li>
    <li> This is our third Clyppi.and it is an amazing nail clipper. It works so much better than all other clippers and trimmers, for both finger and toe nails. It will be very helpful to pedicurists who so often  use ineffective clippers. Also appreciated an email contact by seller asking for feedback. Will be buying more Clyppis for family members.</li>
    <li> Nice little nail clipper. Very well packaging with good quality of the nail clipper. Very easy to handle when cutting the nail.</li>
    <li> by far the best clippers ive owned to date. My boyfriend actually took them from me! So I&#x27;ll have to get another pair! They work on strong hard nails like his and dont leave sharp or jagged edges. Very tough product and good price. I&#x27;d recommend!</li>
    <li> I love them they trim the thickest nails without leaving sharp edges.. would buy more anytime.</li>
    <li> I love how precise and sharp this nail cutter is. Especially for my husband&#x27;s stubborn big toes. With usual nail clippers, even if is new, it takes a couple clips to cut off his nails, but this was like magic, snap, done!</li>
    <li> It was a great product.  It was actually for my Dad who wanted something more that could grip, large enough that could cut easily, and a lot more easy to cut overall.  As he shopped other places or used already existing ones laying around the house,  he was finally satisfied with this one.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants a good nail-clipper.</li>
    <li> One of the best pair of clippers I have every owned</li>
    <li> Came in on time my hubby loves it! good quality</li>
    <li> I am disabled and have loss of coordination, this nail clipper is easy to grip and allows me to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s great. The build quality is fantastic, and I also like that it&#x27;s big.</li>
    <li> High quality, easy to use.  Handles well and does a nice job.</li>
    <li> High quality.  If you have lost strength in your hands and fingers, you can still cut your own nails with these!</li>
    <li> Very Good Product , Little bit big but it does the work</li>
    <li> For anyone with arthritic fingers or finger weakness, these clippers may be the answer to the problem.  They make a clean cut with very little pressure.</li>
    <li> The nail clippers were well received.  The grip where you place your thumb is nice and wide making it the PERFECT clipper.with no slippage.  The cut was nice and precise!  I&#x27;ve been looking for clippers like this for a while now.  My search is over and I&#x27;m happy to have found this product.</li>
    <li> These clippers are extremely well made and work perfectly. The large ones will clip toe nails easily as well. The main body is completely ground for a brushed finish with no spot welds or imperfections visible. The handle has a built in diamond or ceramic nail file. These clippers will last forever (or until someone steals them from you). If you like this type of clipper you should be very happy with them.  I actually got the set of 2, large and small, that comes with a case for both and room for other stuff like nail polish.</li>
    <li> Great Clippers, would purchase my next ones from Clyppi !!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these Large Nail Clipper!!! They are sharp enough to clip your toe nails with no problem. They are very well made and fits comfortable in your hand so no need in worrying about them slipping around in your hands while trying to use them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great toenail clipper. Good leverage. Sharp blades. Good control. I think it&#x27;s the nicest toenail clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a little trouble with my big toes and the small size of my old clippers.  The Clyppi worked better for me, because after all, they are an ultra cool precision tool...</li>
    <li> I received this at a great discount to review. I love these nail clippers they are sturdy and heavy duty. Very well made and sharp. I love the tiny nail file it has built right into the inside of it.</li>
    <li> These toenail clippers are very sturdy and feel high quality. There is a nail file integrated into the lever which is a neat addition. These clippers are comfortable to hold and work great. They are very precise and are something that everyone needs. For the price for these toenail clippers that are some of the best I used, I love them!</li>
    <li> I was expecting an opening of a larger scale.</li>
    <li> My new Clyppi arrived right on time, and I have already put it to the test. It is a well-machined tool and a pleasure to use. Congratulations on developing a fine product.</li>
    <li> I can’t say that I’ve ever giver a whole lot of thought to what nail clipper I purchase. Typically, I just pick up another cheap pair whenever my current product breaks down or breaks me; both of which have been happening more often. My nails are not especially tough or unruly; it seems that the quality on beauty tools has declined in recent years, so I decided to look for a higher quality product that would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could tell immediately upon opening the package that these clippers were better made than any I had previously purchased. They are not overly heavy, but they have some weight to them which makes them feel very secure in your hand. Though I wouldn’t exactly term the design “stylish” as in description, I will say the Clyppi clippers are as attractive as a utilitarian tool could possibly be.  Trims cleanly, with no rough edges. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, although not part of the product itself, I will say that the customer support for this company is top notch. I received two emails from the company; one thanking me for the purchase and another to make sure that my order was received. Both of the communications felt warm and sincere, which I think is very important for any company that promises quality and customer satisfaction. What good is a lifetime guarantee if dealing with the customer service feels like pulling teeth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> These clippers are easy to use - even with my arthritic thumb. I thought I was going to have to have someone else cut my nails until I found these. They are the easiest to use nail clippers I have found.</li>
    <li> does not clip thick nails</li>
    <li> Very nicely made and they appear durable. Fit nicely into the hand and easy to hold on to.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of these clippers. They are a good size and strong. They have a nice weight to them so they feel good to hold.</li>
    <li> Addendum:  Was not happy to have only received one clipper and not two as had been originally pictured, BUT I received an email from the co-founder who took my comments to heart, and as such, they revised the product description, edited the pictures to show only the large clipper, and provided exceptional customer service by sending me a fingernail clipper on them.  OUTSTANDING!  Old school customer service saves the day and it deserves recognition.  Thanks.  The clipper itself is easy to use, but you&#x27;re gonna have to track the clippings, they end up who knows where, almost as if it is too powerful, which may actually be a big plus for some folks.    Original review:  Description states:  \\&quot;BEST LARGE Fingernail &amp; Toenail Clippers\\&quot; and includes a picture of both large and small clippers, leading me to believe this was a set of two clippers, one toe and one finger; it is only one large clipper.  Dirty pool.  Product however is easy to grip, easy to use, but a bit too big for fingernail clipping.</li>
    <li> This is a very good Nail clippers for toes</li>
    <li> I got these clippers for a steal, and why not because you could never have too many clippers! They cut good and clean. My thing is that my nails would get stuck in the clippers after I cut them and that doesn&#x27;t happen with these. They are also pretty good size, so they can cut my fiance&#x27;s nails no problem. I also like that they have a lifetime warranty! Nothing bad to say.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter to keep in her dance bag because when she dances on Point she always forgets to clip her toenails. These are very well made and I really like the way they feel in my hand.  They provide a nice even clean cut. Now I have realized clipping toenails does not have to be a long drawn out process. It&#x27;s like clip clip and you are done. I have bought many inexpensive pair of clippers over the years and now they have all been thrown away and I will be buying more of these to put in gifts for family and my daughters dance sisters.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for nail clippers that actually cut your nails and not just ripped them. This is the product. A smooth cut and very easy to use. I would recommend this product. I will get rid of all the other clippers I have tried.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:c81420c6aea610b2f25f07e128a0a8b9]]When you&#x27;re traveling - especially if you are going to go someplace where you will be barefoot or wearing toeless shoes - it is a good idea to take along a good pair of #ToeNailClippers.The Clyppi nail clippers are sharp enough that they cut your nails  on the first try even if your nails are thick - and often that is the case with toenails. Theses nail clippers save so much time especially when it comes to trimming overgrown, tough toenails - plus there is no fear of tearing, snagging or ripping your toenails - and believe me this painful situation can happen when you use nail clipper sets that are dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clyppi toenail clippers are thick, but lightweight. They have a nice indentation for your thumb to rest on and there is also a ridge on the bottom of the clipper so picking them up and keeping a grip on them is easy. I like that these clippers are 100% brushed stainless steel. I love how quickly and easily they cut my toenails. The top and bottom of these cutters match up perfectly when they close around your nails. This is why this brand gives such a perfect cut every time. The nail file integrated into the lever of the nail cutter is really nice too although I seldom use it on my toenails. However if your toenails need filed instead of cut, this is a handy tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband decided to try them out on his toenails - which needed cut but he was sick of our old, dull clippers that simply would not cut them. The Clyppi toenail clippers cut his toenails quicker than I have ever seen happen. I am so glad we have more than one set of these now. I recommend them both for yourself and as a great gift item.</li>
    <li> I feel rather silly writing a review for nail clippers, but at least I&#x27;m in good company.  These are expensive, and my family has pretty much always used the Revlon kind, but it seems like they&#x27;re not made as well as they used to be.  I was looking for nail clippers that would cut cleanly and not require excessive force to use (since I have some RSI issues, and also, it really shouldn&#x27;t be such a pain to cut your nails).  I use these for both my fingernails and toenails, and they work perfectly.  The built-in nail file is also handy, though I do wish it was a flip-out file (with the curved point on the end) because I typically would use it to clean my nails.  In any case, I just ordered two more - one to carry with me and one to give to my mother who always has issues with her nails splitting after she trims them.  This is a good purchase because I can&#x27;t imagine this sturdy thing breaking, and even if you have a problem, I have full confidence that the company will take care of you.  I got two very nice emails from them shortly after my order.</li>
    <li> The large nail Clipper by Clyppi is excellent for large toenails.  I finally got one that is sturdy enough for my toenails.</li>
    <li> We needed a few sets of Nail clippers. I think there are socks you just lose them overtime. I do a lot of traveling so i wanted a few different sizes and varieties. These are great for my finger nails because they are frail and tiny. I got these on a promotional pricing and am so happy with my purchase! They are not to small so I won&#x27;t be a liable to loose these!</li>
    <li> My hubby and I tried this clipper and we loved it. It cuts easily and leaves your nails clean cut and not sharp edged or cracked. The size looks bigger than most regular clippers but it&#x27;s lightweight and it didn&#x27;t give us any discomforts. The design makes it easier to use, it won&#x27;t flip on you when you are using it. It also cut easy and clean on my hubby&#x27;s thick toe nails. I like that there is a built-in nail pile and it&#x27;s a stainless steel clipper so  I won&#x27;t worry about rust when time comes. It&#x27;s a stylish and effective nail clipper, good quality and will last a lifetime. It could be a great gift to your elderly loved ones especially for my mom in law who suffered from carpal tunnel. I am sure she will love this clipper. We highly recommend it</li>
    <li> construction ok, design not so good.  The opening is too small for toe nails.  None of them actually fit in the opening and as such it is fit for my purpose.  It&#x27;s not good for finger nails as they are not sharp enough.  And the file is too small to be useful.  2 stars is generous.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother and works great.</li>
    <li> Not very sharp and does not open very far for toe nails .very overpriced</li>
    <li> Good price and good product. It&#x27;s very easy to cut and trim nails because it&#x27;s very sharp.</li>
    <li> I had already clipped my nails, so I gave these to my husband to try, and he was VERY impressed.  He has large hands, and those tiny, little nail clippers I usually get him in the drug store are always slipping through his fingers when he&#x27;s cutting his nails.  The old kind we bought don&#x27;t go all the way through his tough nails either.  These were PERFECT for him.  I clipped my youngest child&#x27;s toenails, and she is a wiggler!  I didn&#x27;t drop the clippers ONCE!  The part where you put your thumb is nice and wide, allowing a nice firm grip when you are cutting nails.  They cut clean through without tearing, and they are very sturdy.  I am going to need to stock up on these because I know these will be disappearing quickly around here!  Thanks for making something that makes clipping nails a whole lot easier!</li>
    <li> These are easy grip! That is my favorite thing about the clippers. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to clip your toenails and you cant keep a hold of the clippers. These are very easy to use, great quality. and craftsmanship.  I am glad I purchased these.</li>
    <li> it makes a difference.  who knew.  I have thrown all my other generic clippers in the trash.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail clippers. It is very sharp and did a good job on my nails. It is somewhat large to use on fingernails, so if you need one exclusively for fingernails, you may want to note that, especially if you have smaller nails. I was able to clip both, but it is clearly designed for toenails with its larger clipping head.&lt;br /&gt;It does contain a very small nail file as well. I am not a fan of metal nail files, so I doubt I will ever use it.&lt;br /&gt;Please also note that this comes with a lifetime guarantee, so if you do purchase it, make sure to register your purchase on their website (look on the back of the packaging for instructions or go to: www.clyppi.net/vip  (the website given on the back of the box).</li>
    <li> best nail clipper and bought it at such a great discounted price!!</li>
    <li> So easy to use. Big for better grip and handling.</li>
    <li> The clippers came yesterday and my husband (who the clippers are for) was extremely impressed with the quality and the way that they work. He said &amp;#34;don&#x27;t change anything&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> These clippers are solid in your hand &amp; clip even my thick-*#$ toe nails w/ease. They don&#x27;t twist around or slip out of your hand like some other smooth clippers. They are great for finger nails too. I was looking for an all around clipper &amp; I found it. Now that I will probably never have to buy another nail clipper, I&#x27;m just spreading the word for everyone else. Great clippers</li>
    <li> Nice sharp toenail clippers that should last for many years.</li>
    <li> It was not strong enough for the use of my toenails.  I really did not find it helppful</li>
    <li> Good heavy duty clippers I would reccomend them to anyone</li>
    <li> My husband has broken several nail clippers while clipping his toenails because if how cheap they are, but these have held up very well! They work great for my kids nails as well, they clip well and make nail cutting fast.</li>
    <li> Great product I bought these clippers to cut my gel nails. The mouth of the clippers were wide enough to fit and clip the gel thickness. Plus the clippers are strong not a flimsy clippers that breaks when you push down on the handles .</li>
    <li> The product works very well for those of us who have thickened toe nails due to aging.  Recommend use of this clipper.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are amazing. Easy to use, comfortable to hold and wide. The only reason why they are not getting five stars from me is they don&#x27;t come with the little hook. Maybe it&#x27;s a personal matter but I love to use that little hook to really clean out under my nails. These nail clippers seem very durable. I strongly recommend you guys buy these. I don&#x27;t know about you but I go thru nail clippers very fast and excited to see how long these last me. Right out of the box they look fancier than any nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I wish I had these years ago.  I have a very weak grip in my left hand and have always struggled to cut even my thin fingernails on my right hand.  These clippers are the best I have ever found!  They do a great job on thicker toenails, too.</li>
    <li> Very well made and sharp to do the job with ease.  Folds up to put away.</li>
    <li> Terrible misrepresentation. It was advertised as a LARGE toe nail and fingernail clipper but is in fact a childrens fingernail clipper. I am returning it to Amzon</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd clyppi I&#x27;ve bought because I think its an absolutely amazing piece of workmanship. I was beginning to believe that there was no such thing as a well made nail clipper until I found this one. Well done. I will probably keep buying them when I can&#x27;t think of a great gift for family members. The clyppi is sure to please.</li>
    <li> I love this item!  Very sturdy and cuts well!  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Very high quality! These are the most durable clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> These clippers are easy to use and good for me as I have somewhat weak hands.  I use for both fingernails and toenails.  I like the size, and they are of good quality.</li>
    <li> I ordered four clippers, for myself and family.  They are sharp, wide, very easy to trim with.  Will be ordering more to give as gifts.  Good stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> It works great came fast</li>
    <li> The best product ever. It is something everyone should buy without question. All other nail clippers are junk when you compare so save your money and order</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good clipper, but I didn&#x27;t find it as revolutionary as the other reviews I read.</li>
    <li> This item lives up to its name....it is large! My husband loves them and they have stood up to his usage. I&#x27;ve purchased many clippers since he is a bit rough and his nails are thick.</li>
    <li> I got the Clyppi nail clipper for my Mom. She has arthritis in her hands and we both hoped the Clyppi would be easier for her to use than standard clippers. She says they are the best, and much easier to use than her old clippers. We couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with our purchase.</li>
    <li> First pair of nail trimmers I have ever gotten that are actually better than others. This pair is heavy in the hand and obviously well made. A fold out file would be more convenient than the one built in but... who actually uses the file?</li>
    <li> I did receive my Cyppi and it is terrific.  I bought it because I was having a hard time using the clipper I already had due to the start of some arthritis in my hands.  It is nice and sharp and doesn&#x27;t hurt to clip my nails anymore!</li>
    <li> Great quality and sharp. Big for a mans hands to easily use</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> Good clipper worth the money</li>
    <li> Easy to use, sharp and clean clips, very happy with them. Little expensive for a nail clipper but overall I am happy with my purchase and they made good gifts as well.</li>
    <li> I was excited after reading all the hoopla about these &amp;#34;superior&amp;#34; nail clippers and decided to spend the extra $. Item looks nice but because of the whacky offset design, it does not do a good job cutting nails!  I wanted to believe these were good but I gave up and sent them back. Purchased another brand for a third of what these cost and have found a new pair of clippers that work as expected.</li>
    <li> Really does the job good for those hard toe nails that just dont wanna budge</li>
    <li> This product broke without being unreasonably stressed. Don&#x27;t buy. Overpriced, poorly made, finished the Kobe with minimart nail clippers.</li>
    <li> the best nail clipper I have ever used, especially good on hang nails. I like the nail file.</li>
    <li> Good product. Exactly as represented.</li>
    <li> Not sharp enough... Avoid</li>
    <li> The Clyppi toenail trimmer exceeds my expectations with both function and style. Made of stainless steel, the trimmers are manufactured with quality metal. They are durable and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the finish peeling, flaking, rusting or otherwise breaking down. The edge of the Clyppi was so sharp I didn&#x27;t need to file my toenails after trimming, which I almost always have to with others I&#x27;ve used and they didn&#x27;t peel or split after trimming which helps to prevent ingrown toenails. The placement of the built in file is perfect and provides extra grip at the tip of my thumb. Between the brushed stainless steel, file and wide design I felt so confident using the Clyppi toenail clippers! The toenail trimmers worked well and held up to thick men&#x27;s toenails without bending the clipper shank and cutting effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.</li>
    <li> These are really nice clippers, they are well made and have a nice handle for clipping. They also are a nice size unlike many of the clippers I have used in the past. Very happy with them</li>
    <li> Very nice quality well worth the money</li>
    <li> Excellent  product, works equally well on toe nails or finger nails.  My toe nails were the problem in the past but these clippers cut them easily.</li>
    <li> I used the clippers yesterday and they worked great.  I liked the weight and the sturdiness of the clippers as well as the sharpness of the blades.  These clippers allow for close nail clipping without cutting into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job designing the clippers, I congratulate and thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used the Clyppi for both my toe nails and finger nails and it worked very well. The design is not new or innovative, but the implementation is nearly perfect. The cutting head is sharp and the blades meet perfectly to provide a clean cut. The roughened area on the handle is a nice touch, and provides a good thumb grip even with wet hands. Overall the Clyppi is a precise cutting instrument, and the best nail clipper I have ever used. It seems well worth the cost and I look forward to years of use.</li>
    <li> Nice size and weight.  Never a cleaner cut.  More straight than rounded like the small ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been so impressed by a nail clipper. They are nice and big. A lot of times I am stuck using clippers that can only get one side of my nail which leaves me with uneven nails which can be annoying. Not with these perfectly clipped nails that are even every time! Even clipping my toe nails is easy. The clippers themselves are thick and sturdy there is no breaking them but I am not worried because Clyppi stands by their product with a lifetime guarantee and I stand by them too.</li>
    <li> Very substantial which is good.  Very good leverage especially for the bigger toes.  The wider cutting edge surface takes some getting used to but the very sharp edge is great.  All in all very substantial but a bit clumsy in the hand.</li>
    <li> I love the sleek look of these large mail clippers and with the precision with which they cut.  Perfecto.  I give it a rating of 5 out of 5.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the personal email. The clippers work great. Very sturdy and will built. The large size will probably suit both fingers and toes, as I&#x27;m not picky. Certainly seem like the last pair of clippers I&#x27;ll ever buy, granted I don&#x27;t lose them, which is very possible where I&#x27;m concerned!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a timely manner, undamaged in a package properly designed for size, protection, and ease of opening.  Product is as advertised and does what is advertised.</li>
    <li> cuts so good! love it</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband he loves them they help him when he&#x27;s cutting his toenails it makes his life a lot easier</li>
    <li> Like it...easier to grip and sharper than OTC clippers.  Very happy with it.  Good design.</li>
    <li> I have received my  Clyppi and it works well.  I am using it for finger nails.  It is sharp, well designed and works as expected.  A good value.  I can think of nothing else needed for improvement.</li>
    <li> I received it and it works great. I had a brain injury in 12/2012 and it left my left-side weak, which made it difficult for me to trim the nails of my right hand. The Clyppi is longer than my previously used standard nail-clippers, which provides more leverage for my weaker left hand. Great product for my needs.</li>
    <li> I got this for reviewing and am pleased with the quality and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;My hubby stole it for his toe nails!</li>
    <li> its nice design. I got it as complimentary for review. I love it.</li>
    <li> Taking care of your feet is important and finding the right products that do a good job can be really hard. These clippers are really sturdy, durable, and easy for me to maneuver while clipping. I like the raised thumb pad, it makes it easier to have a good grip on these clippers. After using these, my nails were left with a smooth edge, no sharp or jagged edges at all. So glad to have these with sandal season around the corner!</li>
    <li> High quality, well made product.  Certainly up to the job of clipping difficult toe nails.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The beauty of the Clyppi products that I&#x27;ve tried (this toenail clipper as well as their fingernail clipper) is that you can concentrate on the job at hand instead of concentrating on trying to hold on to the clippers. They are that well designed and executed and that means by using their products, you do a better job of clipping than you&#x27;ve ever done before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to let you know that my boyfriend used the clippers last night and really liked them. They were easy to grip, and cut the toe nails easily. The one we used before was hard to get through the toe nails. Great product.</li>
    <li> These clippers are easier to because of the wider platform.  If arthritis is in your life these will help.</li>
    <li> R&lt;br /&gt;ally great for seniors.</li>
    <li> The Clyppi is the best nail clipper I have ever used. It is well made and easy to use because of leverage and grip, plus, most important, it is very sharp. Congratulations on a great product.</li>
    <li> My set came with both a toe and finger clipper, and a nice nylon case, so 2 stars because these are well designed with a comfortable grip and good file, but the cutting surface is not good at all. The blade edges are slightly rough so they do not cut cleanly; you end up with almost a micro-perforation in your nails where you have to sort of tear the nail away and it leaves a very rough edge. This is on both pairs, so I don&#x27;t think it is a manufacturing fluke. I have a 10 year old $2 grocery store pair that cut much cleaner than these do, so I cannot recommend these for this price.</li>
    <li> Terrible!  Not big enough to even cut the toenails</li>
    <li> When I received the Clyppi toenail clipper, my first thought was &amp;#34;Wow, this thing is BIG.&amp;#34; It does seem to be good quality and has a sharp edge, but honestly, I can&#x27;t quite justify the price.</li>
    <li> The is a saying that says &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;! .  I got tired of those clippers that leave jagged nails that look so horrible.  This clipper does a beautiful job.  I cuts even a man&#x27;s toe nails with ease.. The cut is crisp and clean with no jagged edges.  My family members all agree that this nail clipper is worth the price I paid for it.  It is a cut above the rest in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These clippers are sharp and well balanced.  They are a good size and easy to handle.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This monsters are brutal.  Throw some spikes and black metal decals on them and anyone of the Metalocalypse crew could be seen using these beasts to trim their gnarly toenails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These suckers did short work of my fingernails, and then toenails.  They put my old albertson&#x27;s store bought $3 clippers to shame.  These things are solid, like, that weird metallic solid feeling solid.  They are Sharp and they will Cut You if you ain&#x27;t careful.  So careful where you aim these giant suckers.  They&#x27;re meant for your toes, but will work on your fingers if you have the skill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the file yet, but it seems nice enough.  And the clippers are large enough that using the file is easy enough (I just hate the feeling of files!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a feeling, after WWIII, the cockroaches will be using these clippers and speaking of the ancient ones in reverence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, buy these suckers!</li>
    <li> I got this free item for testing and review purposes. Perfect for stubborn, hard to cut nails. My dad&#x27;s diabetic and clipping his toe nails have always been a struggle for me and my mom. With this new toenail clippers, that is a thing of the past. I am able to help my dad clip his toenails without difficulty. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> We stumbled upon the Clyppi by chance.  I ordered both the fingernail clipper, and the toenail clipper.  The clippers are very sharp, so you don&#x27;t have to squeeze so hard.  They are easy to grip.  They seem very well made.  I have to cut someone else&#x27;s nails and it makes the job much easier.  I only wish I had these years ago when I had to cut my Mom&#x27;s thick toenails.  I have tried many brands and types of nail clippers over the years, and this brand is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that could make the Clyppi better is if it had a fold out file built right on it (as many other nail clippers do) to assist if dealing with an ingrown toenail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase a few as gifts.  It will be a rather UNUSUAL gift, but I believe the recipient will be pleased.  :)</li>
    <li> I have used these on myself as well as my small children.  They work great and don&#x27;t hurt when used.</li>
    <li> Usually I pick up a pair of clippers in the end caps at the store, use them or try to use them throw them away and get another pair with the hopes of finding some that can cut my feet claws :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these Clyppi Toenail clippers online just as a wounder how fast I will throw theses away attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise the clippers are comfortable to hold in those not so comfortable positions when trying to cut your toenails without grabbing skin. They are sharp no tearing the nail the size of the handle part gives me good leverage when cutting the claws :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend these to anyone who is tried all the rest. Two Thumbs Up Clyppi!!!!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. Pure function.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers.  My husband is always cutting his toenails and now he has his own little pair and I don&#x27;t have to go hunt down the clippers.  These are great to grip and clip nice.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Made of good material.  Does not leave rough edges.</li>
    <li> I liked so much I ordered 3 more sets</li>
    <li> A toenail clipper is just a toenail clipper, right? Wrong. My dad always said the right tool for the job always makes it better, and this is it. I had an old Revlon clipper that I lost, and replaced with the $2 version from Target. I was going to replace it with another one, but this guy is much better than the Revlon one I had, and far and away better than the $2 toenail smasher.</li>
    <li> No good made in China</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice toenail clipper. So much nicer than the ones you can buy for five bucks at a Walgreens. Costs three times as much but will probably last three times as long. Worth it if you like your mundane things to be nice.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very sturdy and well-made. I just wish it had the metal file that can also be used to clean underneath the nails</li>
    <li> Finally found a good set of clippers!!!!!! So hard to find quality built products these days. These clippers are fantastic and the quality of construction is evident just from holding them. Love them!!!!</li>
    <li> This nail clipper worked great both on my feet and hands.  Went through thick toenails very easily.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought that the price was a bit steep for clippers, but these are not your run of the mill Dollar Store clippers that break super easy! These are sturdy and even have a small file on them. Worth the money, for sure!</li>
    <li> Clyppi Products are really excellant!  I have purchased numerous Finger Nail Clippers, as well as numerous Toe Nail Clippers shown here!  I have purchased for my own use, as well as to give as gifts.  Clyppi trimmers cut so clean, with zero jagged edges.  Top quality clippers!!!  AND ONE MORE THING, ABSOLUTELY FIRST RATE CUSTOMER SERVICE!</li>
    <li> I am looking for a LARGE toenail clipper, one that is both horizontally wide,  and opens more (vertically) than a sliver.  This clipper is not it.  The width is about 12-13 mm and the cutting jaws are no more than 2-3mm from top to bottom.  It is exactly the same size, or smaller, than every other &amp;#34;man&#x27;s&amp;#34; toenail clipper.  It does cut well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be of good quality, is easily to  grasp etc.  But Amazon offers lots of clippers in this class for way less money. This is overpriced at $17.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I had a Mehaz Professional Angled clipper (about $9.00)  which was considerably larger,  and worked well.  But one drop on a tiled floor and it flew apart in three pieces.  The Search continues....</li>
    <li> Okay but not great. Thought it would be much longer for more leverage and convenience in reaching. Works about the same as the one I have.</li>
    <li> great clipper... only problem was the manufacturer was real pushy about leaving a review... i would have left 5 stars at some point, but, because of the pushy emails, dropping to 4.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised! Very nice.</li>
    <li> Very sharp. Great quality</li>
    <li> quality toenail clippers, not much else to say, they work well</li>
    <li> I need a larger version of these but these are good.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality but I wish that there would have been a leather case that holds both small and large clippers.</li>
    <li> MADE IN CHINA.  NO THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> On time delivery, works great, real sharp.</li>
    <li> Cuts PERFECTLY! Nice and sharp. Does not leave a jagged edge. Would buy again. I bought these after buying the finger nail clippers which worked perfectly. In fact I am going to buy both of them again to keep as spares. That is how much I like them.</li>
    <li> Some clippers I have purchase just haven&#x27;t worked for me.  I have a handicapped daughter and I find it difficult to trim her toe and finger nails with some clippers.  The Clyppi Toenail work perfectly.  They are lightweight and very sharp and easy to handle.  It is easy to see the nail and to reach more difficult areas at the edge of the toe.  It also works well with finger nails.  The edge cuts smooth and curved without much need for filing.</li>
    <li> A finely crafted cutting tool made of handsome stainless steel.  Probably the finest toenail trimmer you can find anywhere.  It is pricy compared the the cutters you will find in the drug store, but if you want the best this is it.</li>
    <li> Excellent professional look and finish. Cuts perfectly smooth nails with litte efforts. I have one handicapped hand which cannot exert  the pressure required to cut the other by a run-of-the-mill clipper. No such problem here. Excellent built-in nail file.</li>
    <li> Best Large Clipper I have ever owned</li>
    <li> It works fine. Dont know what is the hype about.</li>
    <li> Meets my expectations and much thanks to this seller for great customer service that I received!</li>
    <li> I was looking for sturdy clippers for my toenails, and this fits the bill!  They are very solid and take a minimum amount of pressure to clip the nails.  I also tried them on my fingernails, and they work fine for me &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t like long nails.</li>
    <li> When I first began looking on Amazon for what is&lt;br /&gt;normally such a utilitarian item as nail clippers I was amused that there&lt;br /&gt;would even be reviews for such items.  Then as I read the reviews I was&lt;br /&gt;overcome with laughter as I was quite sure there had to be someone--a very&lt;br /&gt;creative someone to be sure--writing and planting such over-the-top and&lt;br /&gt;exaggerated reviews.  I mean, really, how many people could become so&lt;br /&gt;emotionally invested in a pair of nail clippers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While they were  expensive I was tired of the generics bought at the local drug store that&lt;br /&gt;barely worked when they worked and, quite frankly, decided to splurge if&lt;br /&gt;only because I was amused with a company that seemed to egocentric about&lt;br /&gt;their product.  Then the clippers arrived.  First I noticed the attractive&lt;br /&gt;packaging.  These were not some clippers stuck in a clamshell but in a&lt;br /&gt;nicely designed and professional package.  Immediately upon opening you&lt;br /&gt;could see that these clippers were made with an attention to detail, and&lt;br /&gt;on holding them in your hand you could tell that they were well made.  It&lt;br /&gt;was not until I used them. however, that I realized the exuberant reviews&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon were all legitimate as, if anything, they understated the actual&lt;br /&gt;enjoyment in using these clippers.  So not only did they look and feel as&lt;br /&gt;if they were actually designed for quality first and sales second,  but&lt;br /&gt;this was confirmed with their use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, I receive an email from the company not trying tro sell me anything or offering me a discount, but an email simply asking me how well I liked the product.  It just does not get any better than this</li>
    <li> Simply the best clippers i have ever used. Makes a very clean clip job and cuts with little effort.</li>
    <li> These toenail clippers are just as fine as the Clyppi fingernail clippers. Do yourself a favor and get a pair.</li>
    <li> The clyppi is working well. It&#x27;s well designed and easy to use. Precise clean cut and the nail file was a great addition. I initially bought the fingernail clipper and was impressed, so I followed up with the toe nail clipper. Quality product and priced well.</li>
    <li> Like the Clyppi fingernail clipper, the toenail clipper is easy to use and does the job cleanly and easily. I heartily recommend it for anyone fed up with cheap clippers that are hard to squeeze and cut unevenly.  Great design that requires little strength to get the job done!</li>
    <li> OK, so, I almost feel odd getting excited about a pair of nail clippers, but here it is..........These Clippers Are Great!! I am a guy that loves good tools and equipment so I truly appreciate a well made and great functioning tool. I guess I have never owned a great nail clipper before and never realized they could be better. These folks have done a really nice job on the design of these. The feel, balance and function just seems right. I really like seeing some quality coming back to things instead of the cheap, low grade crap we tolerate and seems to be the norm today. Nice Job Clyppi!</li>
    <li> I ordered both the fingernail and toenail clippers and am very pleased with both. I agree with previous comments that they do a great job of actually cutting the nail as opposed to pulling or breaking it which is what I&#x27;ve found with other brands. I have used them on both of my kids (ages 8 &amp; 10) and there were no complaints.  With other brands they would say I was hurting them since the clippers did not do a good job of actually cutting the nail, especially since kids nails seem to be much stronger and thicker than adults. The shape of clippers made it easy to hold onto. No awkwardness at all. I would highly recommend both pairs.</li>
    <li> A precision and quality device.  No regrets, works great.</li>
    <li> Wow! These are great. Very high quality construction and they work better than normal cheap clippers! So glad I got these!</li>
    <li> I needed something to work on thick toenails and they worked great. Am very&lt;br /&gt;pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These are the best toenail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. Very sharp.</li>
    <li> As an almost &amp;#34;old geezer&amp;#34;, my toenails are getting harder to clip (not to mention my body doesn&#x27;t contort into toenail cutting angles as it used to!)&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Clyppi:  I purchased both toenail and fingernail Clyppies and they&#x27;re now on my list of amazing holiday gifts for the family.&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully designed, nice action and very sharp,  you get a nice clean snip every time.  Even delicate hangnails don&#x27;t have a second chance with a Clyppi in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to surround yourself with quality - even for the most innocuous household items.  It&#x27;s the little things that make one&#x27;s life better.  Buy a bunch todady - you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I have the fingernail Clyppi and the the Clyppi toenail clippers. They are both great instruments.  th  They are well built and function flawlessly. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> good product  delivered as promised</li>
    <li> The mouth opening is too narrow for men&#x27;s toenails, the file is very short and practically useless and there is no swing out blade for cleaning. Quite disappointing.</li>
    <li> This item was expensive, but pursuant to the on line ad, I purchased to replace a large personal toe nail clipper I had lost.  I found  two serious problems.  #1, the &amp;#34;lever&amp;#34; or moving piece was not sufficiently rigid to close the cutting surfaces cleanly and tended to wobble, leaving a ragged cut.  Should be a good grade of stainless steel.  #2 the cutting surfaces themselves were too bulky and were difficult properly position to do a clean cut. It may be alright for use on animals, but not for personal use.</li>
    <li> These are the best!  No struggle to  trim his hard toenails!  They worked like a charm. I would recommend  these to anyone. Going to purchase for my nail tech. She will love them.</li>
    <li> One of the best products on the market. Very easy to use clipper. My husband was really surprised at how great the product is.</li>
    <li> Pretty happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t find it 3 times better than ones sold in drug stores for 3-5 bucks though.&lt;br /&gt;Its well made and does its job perfectly, but could be a little cheape</li>
    <li> Very nice clippers. I used them a few times and they work great. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a quality product.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made product that exceeds expectations. Every thing about it says quality.  You&#x27;ll be pleased with the feel and function.</li>
    <li> great clippers, sharp and strong believe they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Works great, love it.</li>
    <li> I have received it and so far, I love it.  First of all, the look of it is even better in person.  It appears (and is) very sturdy, it has a nice weight to it and works wonderfully well.  I am very happy with the Clyppi so far !</li>
    <li> This is a product that I received for review. Normally I use fingernail clippers to do my toes, they&#x27;re small and easier to maneuver in my hands, so when I opened these I was a little intimidated. I sucked it up and used them, and I was in love with the ease of them. They cut very smoothly, and I didn&#x27;t have to go back and touch up my nails like I normally have to. My big toes felt great after I was done (usually they&#x27;re a little sore). The only thing I&#x27;d change would be to add one of those slide out file things (if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re called). Overall, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I used this item right away. Does exactly what is supposed to do. Cut tow nails,clean, efficiently and with no loss of grip. If you have some real funky tow nails like fungus thick, real thick and the like............this is not for you! You require a sniper not a clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied. :)</li>
    <li> The Clyppi is the best nail clipper I have ever used--it is sharp, easy to hold, and well made.  Now my husband wants one!  We are both 80 years old, and we have tried many products in our lifetime.  Clyppi is the best!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best toenail clippers.</li>
    <li> The unit is good and sharp and the grip is easier for my arthritic hands.  Actually, I just purchased the finger nail clipper as well!</li>
    <li> I found this nail clipper easier to clip my nails and son&#x27;s because I have weak hands the grip was made specifically for individual with arthritis or hand weaknesses like me.The nail clipper itself works well and is a good quality stainless steel.</li>
    <li> This work like a charm!! My husband has  literally broken toe nail clippers before trying to cut his toe nails. But not with these. The clippers are very durable nor do they slip out of your hand when trying to cut your nails. They have a comfortable grip and offer a precise cut with your nails whether it be for finger nails or toe nails. I have 7 children and everyone in our household likes them. I trust them to cut my toddlers nails and feel they were made for any type of nail. There is a small file on top of the clipper that my husband pointed out - used- and likes. I am so glad to have found something that will last and can withstand cutting my husbands toe nails. Thank you!</li>
    <li> No effort needed when using these clippers.  Easy to use and very light.  Has a small file on it also.</li>
    <li> Nice clippers and the owners of the company even emailed me to make sure they arrived and worked as expected.</li>
    <li> I have the hardest time finding good nail clippers, so when I saw these I was skeptical but went ahead and ordered them. Boy am I glad I did, these clippers are great. The style fits nicely in your hands, and the clippers are sharp enough to clip the nail all the way though the first time. No second cuts or having to tear the remaining part of the nail off. These clippers cut very well. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased these.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers!  These clippers are very sturdy and easy to use.  They are easy to grasp and hold on to while using.  I would imagine that someone with arthritic hands would be able to use these without difficulty.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the box hubby was hovering over me. He was very interested in the CLYPPI, as was I. We both have hard to cut nails and have a large collection of nail clippers of all shapes and sizes that do not work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both tried the CLYPPI and absolutely love it! The nail clipper is made out of heavy duty stainless steel and screams quality. It is large enough to have a good grip while trimming but not too big to hold in my small hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, Hubby stole the CLYPPI from me so I will have to get another. I don&#x27;t mind buying a second one. The price is great and won&#x27;t hurt my wallet to buy another. The CLYPPI comes with a lifetime warranty, another plus for this product.</li>
    <li> So far these have been some of the best toenail clippers we have used. Sharp enough for my husband but still able to use on my daughter without a problem.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail clipper. It has a solid build with a great high end look. I purchased this item for my father who is older and has difficulty clipping his nails.  This Clyppi unit makes a precision cut and has enabled my father to minimize the time he needs to perform this task. Nice item to pick up as a replacement once your current  unit stops cutting properly.</li>
    <li> I am super happy with the finger nail clippers, I expected these to be the same but more robust. THey tend to flex or snap creating a clicking action after clipping. I do not like this. something may need to be reinforced.</li>
    <li> This is my first time spending a premium on nail clippers, as I&#x27;ve always only bought cheapo $1.99 clippers at retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first, but I must admit that these are worth every penny.  They&#x27;re much more crisp and consistent than any require less effort to clip.  No more jagged edges!  I would say it&#x27;s made it at least 50% easier to do the same job as compared to any retail countertop generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going forward, I know I will be sticking with the Clyppi brand.  I also like the fact that a different design was thought out for the toe nail clippers.  I consider these to be a fantastic value and their customer service has been impeccable.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with this purchase after reading the reviews I got two sets the clyppi toe nail and the clyppi finger nail clipper after the first use on my toes I was a bit disappointed in the way it cut my nails I will return this product</li>
    <li> These clippers are top of the line awesome. They are top quality and really work great. I love that they come with a guarantee also.</li>
    <li> great product, keep them in my purse</li>
    <li> These are hands down the best clippers I have used. They easily and evenly cut the nails. They are a great product.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty stainless steel construction. Cut through thicker nails easily ! I am not afraid of this breaking on me and it seems to be reliable !</li>
    <li> This clipper is nice and sharp and makes a clean cut.  All other brands of clippers that I have bought and tried have &amp;#34;shredded&amp;#34; the toenail.  I have trouble bending over due to arthritis and this one clips nicely on the first try.  It costs a little more than average but is worth it.</li>
    <li> I now have ordered three fingernail and one toenail and they are by far the best clippers I have ever owned. I lost the first pair, and promptly ordered two more to ensure I always had a backup. Really a great product</li>
    <li> Superb product. Very solidly made. Feels superb in the hand.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I have ever owned. Very precise clips and easy to hold. 5 stars all the way.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Opens wider than others I&#x27;ve tried. Requires a bit more force to make the cut than I expected.</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect size!</li>
    <li> This product is well made and works well.</li>
    <li> Wow these work great, best pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> It worked great but lasted less then a month. The steel snapped at the spring while clipping toenails.</li>
    <li> It is much better than a pair of scissors or a regular nail clipper.  If you have a large thick toe nail it still is not perfect, but I have not found a better tool.</li>
    <li> Best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not cheap but - unlike the creap crap you buy for a couple of bucks - they are well made AND GUARANTEED for life. Now all I have to do is not lose them - LOLOL!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you are careful with these they should last for many, many years - they cut great and seem to be very well designed. I would rate these a very high 9.0 to 9.5 out of 10 - VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> Wonderful nail clipper.  Sturdy, strong, and clips well.</li>
    <li> Really nice.  The cut is at a more perpendicular angle than ordinary clippers so the feel of the cut nails is great.  Now I realize that comment needs clarification.  My experience with, say Revlon clippers, is that the edges of the nail have an edge that needs rounding with a file to feel smooth.  With Clyppi the edge is not there and the nail feels more comfortable in the nail bed.  I use these mainly for fingernails.  I recommend this product.  I also agree with the other reviewers who point out that the packaging is refined and the seller does a good job of follow-up on delivery and satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Truly the &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll see how long they last.</li>
    <li> I received it, and it works well with my tender knuckles.</li>
    <li> Broke the first time used.  Need I say more?</li>
    <li> Very good company and nice product</li>
    <li> These are ok clippers.  I use these for both finger and toe nails.  They seem to get dull after a few uses and don&#x27;t clip as easily.</li>
    <li> I felt ridiculous and frivolous for spending that kind of money on a pair of nail clippers, but after using them for about 6 months, I feel it was a pretty solid purchase that I&#x27;ll never have to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are made of heavy gauge stainless steel with very sharp blades. It&#x27;s very easy to provide plenty of pressure to the blades for a clean cut. The nail file element is basically a set of three small rectangular slots in the back of the unit that have pretty sharp edges, so that running your nails against them will smooth them without the need for any element that could dull over time.</li>
    <li> The Clyppi Toenail Clippers are sharp and sturdy like other premium clippers.&lt;br /&gt;They are a little wider at the cutting edge than most other clippers.&lt;br /&gt;However, I disagree with the Clyppi advertising (\\&quot;Clyppi: BEST Toenail Clippers\\&quot;), as the [[ASIN:B000F37UNM Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper]] is a little sharper, with a smoother, more balanced action.</li>
    <li> Space between blades is a little tight</li>
    <li> Great clipper. The wider pressure lever makes it so much easier to use. They are also extremely sharp and cut beautifully with no bending of the nails!</li>
    <li> Really work great.  I decided to buy after buying the fingernail clippers which are terrific too.</li>
    <li> Most expensive nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. And the best, too. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sturdily made but with a curved cutting edge makes it difficult to trim big toe toenails.  These nails are usually wider than the curved nose of the clippers.  I think a straight cutting edge would be more useful.Nee</li>
    <li> This is what i wanted.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, works great, built to last.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail clipper.  I wish I had found this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> The best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  I love it!  It feels so sturdy and comfortable in my hand.</li>
    <li> After exhaustive research I purchased these for my wife as a gift. At first she was less than enthusiastic. Then she used them. Huge bonus points for me!  These will be the last pair of clippers she ever needs!</li>
    <li> I have thicker toenails and have always struggled to find a nice set of clippers that don&#x27;t slip out of my fingers as I try to use them on my thicker nails.  Enter...Clyppi Precision Large Nail Clippers.  They are the perfect size to help me tackle my tough nails.  The easy-to-hold grip on each side of the top portion prevents my fingers from slipping as I try to clip my toenails.  These larger ones are the best because they have a larger clipper head that is made for toenails. This is of ultimate importance to me, because nail clippers are too small and I sometimes cut my skin with them, yet these would not work for fingernails that have a smaller bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since they are made of stainless steal, this helps as I usually clips my nails after the shower since they are softer and easier to cut.  These won&#x27;t rust or tarnish with water exposure and will make them last much longer than ordinary toenail clippers.  My favorite part, thought, is that there is no pointy nail file in between the adjustable layer and base of the clipper, that always gets in my way with other clippers. These clippers are worth the price, as they will last longer and provide better performance over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I have received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and my nails look like they were done by a professional. I will never use those cheap ones from the drug store again.</li>
    <li> These feel very sturdy and cut your nails with a nice snap. The only complaints I have is they sometimes leave your nail looking like it has a slight very thin folded edge or rim around it. The other thing is it leaves your nails VERY sharp. I am a man and have never really thought about filing my nails. After clipping my nails with these I absolutely have to file my nails to a dull edge otherwise one careless scratch could leave me bleeding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use these and file my nails but once they break or go missing I am not getting this brand again.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and this size is perfect for both toes and fingers on a man.&lt;br /&gt;$15 kind of hurts for clippers, but they would be a steal at $10, so I&#x27;m happy I bought them.</li>
    <li> I did receive the Clyppi nail clipper from Amazon and since I have a Amazon Prime subscription it arrived in (2) days. First off I have been using a Revlon nail clipper for over (10) years and it worked well. Unfortunately those were misplaced and I made sure to buy a new Revlon clipper because of my previous experience. Sadly the new Revlon nail clipper I bought is extremely hard to push closed and I believe they are defective. After that, I decided I needed a really good pair of clippers and did a bit of research. I found a article that described the top ten nail clippers of 2014 and after looking at all the others I liked the look of the Clyppi clippers plus the excellent reviews of your product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;  When I received the Clyppi nail clippers I was immediately impressed with the packaging and the quality of the clippers. It was obvious these clippers were well thought out- right down to the thumb indention where you place your thumb to squeeze the clippers while cutting a nail. I was also impressed with the website where you register the new Clyppi clippers- which was a breeze to do. I haven&#x27;t used the clyppi clippers yet but I am pretty certain they will be the best clippers I have ever used - just by looking at them. The price was very reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> Sharp and precise. Good quality product</li>
    <li> These have a nice pricey feel to them. They feel like they are made of quality metals. Very sharp and cut toe nails very neat and quickly.</li>
    <li> Got this on a $1 promo deal and i must say they are the best clippers I have ever used. They are very sharp and very sturdy. One of my favorite features is the slight bend the clipper has. It really makes a big difference in the how much grip and control you have while clipping. Well done Clyppi!</li>
    <li> not big enough to cut mt toe nails.  I thought it might havde been a finger nail cutter.</li>
    <li> Was not for thick nails.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a Christmas present. They lived and said it worked great.</li>
    <li> Both of my knees have been replaced and can hardly bend to reach my toes with my fingers being so very arthritic. After all these years I finally found these clippers and they are so easy to use. I did not have to press hard on these clippers at all to trim my nails. Having to always get a pedicure was extremely hard for me. Many times I was in way too much pain and had to leave before the pedicurist finished trimming my nails.&lt;br /&gt;These clippers did a quick clean and smooth cut on each nail and I did not have to file my nails after I was done.. I am so very happy.</li>
    <li> very sharp ,excellent material</li>
    <li> Great clippers. They are clearly made with the highest quality standards and they cut perfectly.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised, sturdy clippers with clean cuts. No jagged edges left behind.</li>
    <li> I expected a good quality product judging from the price and the statements in the product description . These toenail clippers performed only as well as a pair I might have gotten from the drugstore - for less money. These clippers did not remotely live up to the claims made about them.</li>
    <li> I have always hated clipping my toenails with the small clippers that usually come in manicure sets. Invariably the clippers are difficult to grip and usually slip out of my hands. That&#x27;s why I finally decided to order these clippers, and I am extremely happy that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This clipper is large (but easy to hold) and doesn&#x27;t slip when I use it. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t require much pressure, for it is extremely sharp and cuts with little effort. I also use it to clip my fingernails and it works equally well on them. I&#x27;m never going to go back to the old manicure set clippers. If you have problems with your small clippers, I can highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband and he loves it. He&#x27;s been using it for couple of months now and they work really well.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. This solves a huge ongoing dilemma for me. I struggle to find clippers that are strong enough for my nails, but I can actually use them. The clyppi are perfectly designed and sharp. Thank you Clyppi. My hunt is over. Great customer service, and prompt shipping is just another way Clyppi has won my heart. Thank you Clyppi.</li>
    <li> These are very good clippers and I love that they have a made in file on them! grip in the hand very nice.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t open wide enough if you have thick toe nails.  able to cut with artheritic hands.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these , stainless steel construction with a built in file surface, a very nice product</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t open as widecas I thought it would</li>
    <li> I really like the Clyppi nail clippers.  They are very sharp and work much better than the several pairs that I have bought at department stores.</li>
    <li> Very high quality and well built toenail clippers. I&#x27;m used to the cheap ones that I get a Walmart, so this was a really nice change. Does what it is supposed to do . I&#x27;m gonna make sure I never lose these like I do my others. Promotional price received.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers.  Very sharp and easy to use even with very thick problem nails.  Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> After buying the clippers in December for a stocking stuffer, they seemed like a quality product.  With only a couple of weeks of normal use, the top handle sheared off and the clippers were useless.  Upon discovering this, the company contacted me right away and replaced the product.  I am very pleased with their efforts to resolve this situation.</li>
    <li> When I was asked to try out these nail clippers, I could not have been more happier. I have, honestly, been looking for some good nail clippers for over a year. The only nail clippers in my home were used by my girls when they were infants. Obviously, using the infant nail clippers was not an option for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day these nail clippers arrived, I was very excited because my nails were a bit on the long side and needed to be cut down. Well, as soon as I began using these clippers, I only had to clip my nail one time to get the full nail cut down to the shape I needed them to be. Now, I am not sure about other nail clippers, but these are ergonomically made and feel so good in my hand as I begin clipping off my finger and toenails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to look for any other make or model of nail clippers, especially when all you need is one, or two, of these nail Clyppi clippers. You know, these would be great for gifts or those spa days, like a mani/pedi spa day at home by yourself, with girlfriends or family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclaimer: I was given this product to try our for an honest and fair review.**</li>
    <li> Perfect design with precise cutting</li>
    <li> It is a very useful item, good size, very helpful.</li>
    <li> Solid clipper. Works well. Precise, clean cut unlike others I&#x27;ve tried. Feels nice in the hand. I don&#x27;t care how it looks so long as it works well, but it does also happen to look like a nice piece of machined metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue : Mine did actually start to rust after not having for very long. Not good and a bit unexpected as I assumed it was made from high quality stainless. Which apparently doesn&#x27;t mean it cant rust if exposed to moisture.  Which in a bathroom is inevitable. On the plus side customer service was fantastic. Very responsive. And quick to remedy with a replacement. They did, however, advise NOT to store the clippers in the bathroom. A bit odd as its the only place my clippers have ever been stored. No big deal though. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Solid style but weren&#x27;t sharp at all.</li>
    <li> Received your toenail clipper and it doesn&#x27;t open as far as my old clipper which is disappointing. I have a very thick toenail and the opening of the clipper needs to open more to be able to get all of the nail in its jaws. It is high quality and sharp, just not big enough. Disappointing for $15 especially when you advertise it as large and for large nails. That is specifically why I bought it.</li>
    <li> The Clyppi Toenail Clipper is ok. It needs improvement. The clipper end needs to be flatten, it&#x27;s a bit balky. Each piece is sold separately,needs to be sold as a pair with a case.</li>
    <li> Excellent strength for my older, brittle, and thick toenails.  ;-)</li>
    <li> These clippers are the best I have ever purchased, I now have both the toenail clippers and the fingernail clippers from Clyppi.</li>
    <li> Love these!  Very sturdy clippers.  They are durable, yet very lightweight and easy to use.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great! Very sharp and no slip grip!</li>
    <li> Another Christmas gift for my husband to deal with his tough toe nails.  He says they are much easier to use than the previous clippers he used.</li>
    <li> Received these Nail Clippers yesterday and I was ecstatic to use them. When I started using them It was easy as pie. I have really big toenails and usually I struggle clipping them because I always have rough edges.&lt;br /&gt;Not with these! These were easy and did not leave a rough edge on any of my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
    <li> Best clippers that I have ever used! Very sturdy, yet light weight and precise. Top notch quality. I love the design as well. These should last me a lifetime :)</li>
    <li> These clippers are AMAZING!!! They are very sturdy and sharp which, to me, is very important in getting a good, clean even cut. Solidly made and I feel like these are going to last me forever!</li>
    <li> This clipper for size reminds me of what I have purchased in the past for toenails.  It is bigger so it is easier to grip.  It has a file on top of the handle built in that seems of good quality.  Unfortunately, it only is a small area and not covering more of the handle.  I thought it worked well to cut my finger nails, but my spouse tried it after and thought the blade seemed blunt.  He had difficulty with the Clyppi and getting through his nails, especially his thumb nail.</li>
    <li> They are very nice! They are a perfect size - not too big and not too small; the stainless steel is finished very cleanly, like the old days of &amp;#34;Made in USA&amp;#34;; they have a positive action, and they inspire confidence with their lifetime warranty.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I ever had.  User friendly for all nails.</li>
    <li> Its hard to find a great pair of clippers for me as I&#x27;m very picky. I received these to review and I&#x27;m very please with them. They are well made and have not fallen apart on me like other clippers I&#x27;ve had. They are easy to hold and not awkward. They are sharp and actually cut my nails and not just bend them. I will be purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> These are large, easy for my hands to hold. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The image is decent,, but the head of the clipper is to small for thick toe nails.</li>
    <li> takes some effort to cut, and not much control.</li>
    <li> blades should be straight across and open wider.  No better than most others and not nearly as good as some.</li>
    <li> Used just one time before I lost it, but cuts as advertised (sharp and precise) and has a great file.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! It’s the best clipper I’ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Was time for a pedi last night. So finally got to use the Clyppi! Have to say I like thee a lot, not thin and cheap like most clippers where you have to use both hands to actually get through the nail  These clippers are pretty sharp! I could squeeze with a bit of pressure and a perfect cut. Clean cut no rough edges where you have to go back and nip off the spots.I read some reviews that state they had a gap but mine did not. The blades met against each other perfectly. Great product on my opinion!!</li>
    <li> Beautifully manufactured. Sharp. I have large hands and am getting old, so my nails are getting tough. I appreciate the larger handle and cutting even toe nails is a cinch. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it: toenails are a nasty business! I don&#x27;t know about you but I&#x27;m not a fan of feet! I want my feet to always look nice and groomed but the actual act of doing it is not my favorite thing to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toenails are in a class all of their own. They are so much bigger than fingernails that they really do require their own tool. Have you ever tried to cut them with a fingernail clipper? I always end up with jagged toe nails because I can&#x27;t cut my big nail in one shot. Enter Clyppi Toenail clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A special tool just for the toenails! I go through clippers pretty quickly because they always seem to break on me. With these I can just feel the quality by the weight in my hands. They are thick and sturdy and not likely to break (and if they did, there&#x27;s a lifetime guarantee!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toenail clippers aren&#x27;t something I&#x27;d expect to look fancy but these have a really nice look with their stainless steel brushed finish. I think my favorite feature is the built in file right on the handle so you don&#x27;t have to slide it out as a separate section. Those always seem to break first on me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband saw these and instantly snatched these from me stating that they looked like great quality. We both tried them and they felt comfortable in our hands and cut cleanly without leaving jagged edges or cracking our nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the little things in life that simplify it and these Clyppi Toenail Clippers have done just that!</li>
    <li> These clippers are amazing!  They are sturdy and durable.  I can&#x27;t imagine them EVER breaking and they can handle the toughest toenails!</li>
    <li> These are the rolls Royce of nail clippers... these are amazing... they are super sharp and the fact that they clip flrst try is amazing... I have to buy myself one now because my husband took over these...</li>
    <li> Work great! Love the product.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers! They cut both fingernails and toenails with ease!</li>
    <li> I used it right away and loved it. Finally I have control of the cutter and nails aren&#x27;t split or torn as with my old cutters. I particularly liked the grip on the push handle. No slips no fuss! A Lifetime Warranty??  Thanks, John</li>
    <li> The clippers are sharp. Good engineering, but did have trouble shortening the wider toe nail on the big toe. Why 5 stars...I have used them just once and feel that I have to get used to the proper placement. They did not split or shatter any nails. Clean cuts.</li>
    <li> good quality but if it&#x27;s not sharp enough for toenail.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers. They feel sturdy and do a great job. I usually hate clippers but these cut very nicely leaving little rough edges</li>
    <li> My problem is osteoarthritis in wrists and hands.  The more acute angle of the lever on the Clyppi allows me to use them with less pain and effort.  The flat, broad lever does not gouge the center of my palm like the standard clipper levers do.  A nice instrument.</li>
    <li> This Clyppi is great! No more butchering my toenails! I wish I had bought it years ago. Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s attractive, easy to use. In particular, my partner, who suffered a massive stroke 6 years ago, finds it easier to use than the other clippers he has tried, including one that was supposedly designed for stroke survivors. The raised areas on the back of the fold out lever part of the clipper help him keep his thumb firmly on the lever when he presses down to clip a nail. We also really liked that the clipper&#x27;s &amp;#34;mouth&amp;#34; was large enough to handle big and thicker nails. A quality product.</li>
    <li> In a effort to improve my nail quality, one of the things I did was purchase a Clyppi.  It worked well so I purchased a second one to carry in my purse, (and a third when that one was lost in recent travels).  It has been helpful in my efforts to stop my nails from splitting.  For me it works much better than standard drug store clippers.  Thanks Clyppi!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Clyppi for my husband and he loves it! Other clippers were not strong enough... and he actually broke a few! So he is very happy and impressed.</li>
    <li> Well packaged. Work great, delivered as advertised.</li>
    <li> Finally a toenail clipper that doesn&#x27;t pop apart.  Definitely a much better quality that the old cheap clippers and much sharper.  It has a nice weight to it and looks good too.</li>
    <li> These work great and are a little wider than most clippers making them perfect for toenails.</li>
    <li> Stainless steel (no rust when they sit in the bathroom). Clip off nails easily without any fuss.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for toenail clipper.</li>
    <li> Has a nice and firm spring for clipping.  The small file on the handle is convenient to smooth any rough edges. Good for finger and toe nails.</li>
    <li> The material and design of these are fantastic. I know, nail clippers, but still.. they are very solid feeling and extremely durable.</li>
    <li> The Clyppi is just as advertised---sharp and easy to use.  Much sturdier and more comfortable to handle than any I&#x27;ve found in the drugstore. But my husband&#x27;s big-toe nails are wider than the instrument, so I can&#x27;t shorten them in one cut. Also, his big-toe nails are thick, and it is hard to get them into the space between the cutting edges.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been clipping my nails wrong this whole time. It really does make a difference if you are clipping with a regular nail clipper or one specifically designed to clip toe nails. This is the one. It&#x27;s large in your hand but manageable, so it&#x27;s not slipping out of your hand. It has a great grip and a strong clinch. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the clippers or nature, but I don&#x27;t feel like my toe nails grow back as quickly now that I&#x27;m using an actual toe nail clipper.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Especially for guys because it has bigger panel.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s worth the few extra dollars over a cheap set of clippers.  But let&#x27;s see what i think after a year or two of use.</li>
    <li> Sharp as advertised. Took a couple of times to get used to such a big clipper. Once over that huddle, I found it does clean cuts with precision without hesitation. My whole family members agree that it is great buy. Now I am getting one more for my parents.</li>
    <li> I recived my CLYPPI&#x27;S a few days ago. I used them on myself and my children only thing i can say is they are well worth it, they worked on my thick toenails too. They cut through nails like butter and the file is a really nice extra to make your nails extra smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this! Easy to use and very sharp!</li>
    <li> In the beginning, I didn&#x27;t expect any differences on using this clipper. Well, it does look neat and nice, and it&#x27;s lightweight. So what? I guess every nail clipper should look like that. However, I knew I was totally wrong right after the first snap. This one is incredibly good! It clearly cuts my nails with ease. No jagged toe nails and finger nails. I&#x27;ve tried other nail clippers before, but no one can do what this one does. I then went back to see other Amazon reviews and totally agree with them: This clipper is awesome!! I plan to buy more for my family members. Wonderful product. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I can only give this clipper one good thing, its easy to hold in your hand while clipping tour toe nails. Other than that it is an expensive cheap looking clipper from China. I should have bought one made in Germany. Live &amp; learn.</li>
    <li> This has a very sharp smooth cutting edge.</li>
    <li> It is a nice product.</li>
    <li> I really like how sharp these are. They don&#x27;t bend or leave jagged edges. Very clean, smooth cut on my nails. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The item is well made and works great! Great value!</li>
    <li> A really large nail clipper. Work properly as it should be.</li>
    <li> If you have any hand problems do not buy this clipper. It is very difficult for arthritic hands to use.</li>
    <li> Just a normal size clipper.</li>
    <li> Love it! its strong and cuts perfectly!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been so thrilled with my fingernail Clyppi that I just bought the toenail size, as well.  Just as the first one did for my fingernails, the toenail Clyppi does for my toenails: effortless, clean cuts.  I can&#x27;t believe it when I think of how many years I struggled with my old pair of clippers!!!  This pair makes me feel as though my arthritis is suddenly better!  I&#x27;m so grateful.</li>
    <li> I like the way these feel in my hand, it&#x27;s heavy but the metal isn&#x27;t too slippery so gripping is a breeze. They work really well on my toenails which tend to be thicker them most and require pressure to cut. They did a good job of clipping without tearing. My husband said it left one nail ragged but has not experienced that since the first time he used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip on these is so good that I have used them to clip my 18 month olds nails when I can&#x27;t find the baby clippers.</li>
    <li> Just works. Well designed. Easy to operate. Cuts even the toughest toenails - quickly and drama-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair price for a great tool.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, but the opening is not extra wide and still leaves me with problems for a thick nail.</li>
    <li> The Clyppi met all of my expectations.....it is great.  I have a hard time gripping things, this is a wonderful clipper that even I can use !!</li>
    <li> I really like these, will just have to see if they stay sharp.</li>
    <li> Does what it suppose to do,, but really good</li>
    <li> As advertised, very nice.</li>
    <li> This is the best clipper I have found. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping and service was also top of the line.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, Precision trimmer. Worth the extra few bucks. This should last for many years.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job, just what I was looking for. Especially for my large toenails. Other clippers didn&#x27;t seem to open wide enough. I used to used a grinder on these especially thick nails.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I bought this to replace an old, cheap, small clipper that I had been using for much too long despite the difficulties involved in using such an inadequate clipper.  This toenail clipper is sharp and has a large opening that makes cutting toenails a breeze.  It&#x27;s just large in general, and its size makes it so easy to cut nails without the clipper rolling over, which can cause injuries.  What a sturdy product!</li>
    <li> I had to return because of the heavy and bad design.</li>
    <li> We received our Clyppi a few days ago, and they are AMAZING. My boyfriend keeps breaking clippers because I guess he has adamantium nails or something, I don&#x27;t know. But these clippers treat his nails like butter. Even my thumbnails had to submit to the mighty power of the Clyppi. I like that it had a small patch of file on the clippers, but let&#x27;s be real here; it&#x27;s almost completely inaccessible for short nails. Great thought, though, and it seems like a really decent file. If we didn&#x27;t keep our nails short, it could probably be used, but we work with our hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using these clippers for ever!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good toenail clipper. I have thick toenail and I always want a sharp clipper. This product definitely meets my needs. It&#x27;s very convenient to use.</li>
    <li> Does not open wide enough for me.</li>
    <li> Very strong nail clippers.  I have a few pairs and these are my favorite. Good size for any type/size of nail</li>
    <li> These are definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I liked these...they Ser to be sharper than other clippers, they cut my toe nails quite easily.</li>
    <li> OK , not worth the price</li>
    <li> Ultimately, the product needs to be good to get an excellent rating. Where this product falls short is precision and functionality. The first set we received I noticed the blades didn&#x27;t meet flush. When holding the clippers up to the light and lightly pressing on the lever one edge of the blade made contact while there was a gap on the other side. The company was very good about sending a second pair. Unfortunately, the second pair is exactly the same. The finger nail clippers don&#x27;t suffer from this defect - the blades close evenly against each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second &amp;#34;functional issue&amp;#34; is the nail file. For us it&#x27;s useless as it&#x27;s so far from the edge of the handle that you can&#x27;t use it to file your nail unless your nails are long. We cut ours short. Not a big deal we have a separate nail file, but if you are basing your decision on having one device for both jobs you might want to know this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I give the company 6 stars for customer service and I think once they have these two issues ironed out they will have a stellar product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with these!  My elderly mother is unable to bend far enough to care for her own toenails, and I absolutely hate dealing with the assortment of implements she&#x27;s assembled over the years to trim her thick diabetic nails.  It was a lengthy, frustrating process in which I fumbled with slipping metal as she winced in pain.  I bought these clippers specifically because other reviewers had recommended them for diabetics, and they were absolutely correct.  At first glance, they looked similar to other clippers I&#x27;ve tried at far lower price-points, but they most definitely work differently.  They don&#x27;t slip in my grip, and they make a clean and quick cut with one satisfying snap.  I was able to finish off my mother&#x27;s nails in a tenth of the time it normally takes, with no pain and drama.  Well worth the price.  I&#x27;ve tossed the other toenail clippers, and I&#x27;m back to order the fingernail Clyppi.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and great for weak hands.  Will tell all my family how pleased I am.  The company also thanked me for the purchase.  Great customer service I&#x27;d say.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they were for thicker toenails.  They did arrive on time, are well made, albeit a bit pricey I think, but are no different in size or thickness than the ones you can pick up for much less at local stores which last for years!  Definitely not worth the extra money if you are looking for something to trim thicker toenails!</li>
    <li> Does a great job! Super sharp, gets the job done in one pass rather than several.</li>
    <li> I received my Clyppi and have had an opportunity to use it once. First of all, I like the design, especially the wide lever which made it easier to use. It did a very good job and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase. However, I was disappointed by one thing; I was hoping that the clearance between the blades would have been wider. A wider opening would facilitate an easier placement on the toenail and would be helpful in cutting nails which have grown thicker with age, (my wife and I are both in our 80&#x27;s).</li>
    <li> ThiS clipper works great!! Sounds silly to say a nail clipper is different than the rest but it just is.......highly recommend especially for those obsessive clippers</li>
    <li> A little large for my arthritic Moms fingers. But they are really nice clippers for the price!</li>
    <li> These large nail clippers from Clyppi are wonderful. I personally hate having any sort of nails, so I cut them all the time. Most nail clippers that I have used in the past slip out between my fingers or simply fall apart. These nail clippers are much sturdier than that and their durability can be felt when squeezing them shut. They are sharp and get the job done. I&#x27;ve only used them a few times since I&#x27;ve received them, and plan on using them a lot more.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and love these clippers</li>
    <li> Very nice and sturdy nail clippers work well for all nails</li>
    <li> The clipper did arrive on time as promised. I&#x27;ve already used it,  like the shape and feel in my hand a lot. It is very sharp, thanks for a&lt;br /&gt;really nice product.</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers! Very sharp and more comfortable in the hand. The longer base gives you more leverage to clip with and the clipper stays put in your hand. Nice Job.</li>
    <li> Sharp, cuts the nail really well rather than smashing through it like most. I feel like they will last a few years at least.</li>
