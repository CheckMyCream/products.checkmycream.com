    <li> Zote is a great soap. This soap cleans better than most laundry detergents. I have used this for years and plan to keep using this soap for years to come. I have tried other laundry soaps and found that they were too hard and dry to grate for detergent and did not clean as well as Zote. Zote dissolves easily and the close come out cleaner than store brands.</li>
    <li> You can get this same bare at Wally World for 99 cents, but it works fantastic :) I make laundry detergent with it and Dish washing soap it works amazing, removes grease and oil. I love it and have bought tons of it.</li>
    <li> This is a huge bat of soap and smells so good.</li>
    <li> These bars are just not pleasant smelling at all and too mushy when you try to grate them and use them in a home made powder detergent. Not impressed what so ever. I&#x27;ll stick with the Dr Bronners soap bars or even Ivory or Fells Naptha.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to make DIY laundry detergent. I am so happy with the end result (this is not the only ingredient). The smell of this soap is clean and fresh and that is how my laundry comes out.</li>
    <li> Nice to handle easily grated made great laundry soap</li>
    <li> Works perfectly in my homemade laundry soap.  It helps get my husbands work clothes clean and he is a mechanic.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS FOR 25+ YEARS &amp; LOVE IT!! IF THIS DOESN&#x27;T GET THE STAINS OUT OF YOUR CLOTHES (OF COURSE BEFORE WASHING &amp; DRYING)  NOTHING WILL!!</li>
    <li> I love these for cleaning my makeup brushes and travel. I cut the bar in thirds because it&#x27;s SO BIG, so I keep one piece just in my suitcase so it smells good.</li>
    <li> Smells great, worked good in making my homemade laundry detergent but was supposed to receive 4 bars and there were only 3 in the bag.</li>
    <li> I have a recipe for homemade laundry soap and this is one of the ingredients!</li>
    <li> I make my own laundry detergent &amp; it seems to make the whites come out whiter if I add Zote &amp; salt to the basic recipe (Fels Naptha, Washing Soda, &amp; Borax). The citronella scent is mild enough that it doesn&#x27;t make your clothes smell lemony.</li>

    <li> The key is to rinse the poop off right away and then to wash by hand with the Zote.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot, just scrub off the majority of the stains.  The rest will come out in the wash.</li>
    <li> I love it alot. I won&#x27;t be buying laundry detergent for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I use this soap for removing stains. I can only speak for removing an ebf baby&#x27;s poop stains. Even if the stain is a day or two old. I used to use Shout and oxyclean but they never worked, a dingy brownish stain would remain. See my pics for this review.</li>
