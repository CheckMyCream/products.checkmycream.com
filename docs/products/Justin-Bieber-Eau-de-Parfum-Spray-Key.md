    <li> I purchased this for my 15 year old granddaughter who loves anything Justin Bieber. I was excited about the set because she only asked for the perfume. She really loved it when she opened it on Christmas. I would recommend this for teenagers who like Justin.</li>

    <li> I have no idea what this smells like as it was a mail-order gift for my teenage niece.  She was ecstatic with it.
