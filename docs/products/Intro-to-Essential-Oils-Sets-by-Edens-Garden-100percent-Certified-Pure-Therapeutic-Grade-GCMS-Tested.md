<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great starter oil kit. Edens gardens is affordable and I don&#x27;t have to join an oil club which is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of essential oils in general and first order from Eden Garden.  I do not regret this order, I LOVE IT! and I plan on purchasing more!&lt;br /&gt;The package was a bit cheap, but they arrive intact. Aside from that, I love it!</li>
    <li> yes iam still exploeing the benefits of the oils and so far it is satisfied</li>
    <li> I love it! I use some of the oils for massages and they really make me feel amazing. My favorite are the lavender, four thieves and lemon but I absolutely love them all. I diffuse them at work and I honestly feel the mood elevate despite the heavy workload</li>
    <li> High quality.  Added value with the product use info and the full line product catalog included.  Wonderful EOs.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Now essential oils.  Just recieved a few of Eden&#x27;s oils.  I love the ones I just used.  My neighbor does Doterra.  I believe I have found my new favorite.  Thanks Eden Essentials.</li>
    <li> This set is part of the first essential oils I ever purchased. The uses with this particular set are endless. I love that the lid comes with use suggestions. These oils are high quality and smell great. I love Eden&#x27;s Garden!</li>
    <li> Awesome! And arrived very soon!</li>
    <li> I simply love these oils.  This company has pure wonderful oils</li>
    <li> This seemed like a great item to have around for less than some of the other expensive brands.  The lavender smelled good and I loved it until my daughter dumped the whole bottle out in her bedroom... So I ordered the organic version and didn&#x27;t like it at all!  (I have a lot to review on that particular item in its own thread section). I also ordered the muscle relief blend comparable to DoTerra&#x27;s deep blue.  It actually did help my muscles one night after an excruciating,  unusual day of physical labor.  It did not help hubby when he had muscle problems in his neck.  But I sadly,  and with deep anguish,  must confess that when my friend who is a doterra consultant allowed me to compare these with hers,  that brand had much stronger, more pure smelling scents than these.  So. ... These smell lovely and work to some extent. But they are by no means pure.... but this price is much more affordable , so I guess it depends what you&#x27;re looking for!  :)</li>
    <li> Purchased two of these as Christmas gifts. I was thrilled to get such a great idea from Spirit. Gifts were a big hit with both parties. One my daughter who I have spoke to about using esstential oils for the children instead of medications was very excited to receive them. My 4 year old grandson was running fever that night and she got out the kit and rubbed pepermint oil on him within 1/2 an hour he was wringing wet the fever had broke! The other was for a dear friends family, and was relayed back to me they went on and on about the oils and how they loved them. I would recommend this kit to anyone who is thinking about essential oils, it is a great introduction and a value! Thank you Eden Gardens.</li>
    <li> Great! Bought this as a gift. Would recommend highly!</li>
    <li> We have been using these oils along with the book, and we have enjoyed them very much. been wonting to do this for a whiloe and Amazon made it simple. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great service and product</li>
    <li> I ordered a survival medicine book and many essential oils are used in several ways...this is exactly what I wanted/needed to be able to try these remedies. The bottles are solid,sealed,and well labeled as well as uses for each on inside of box cover...very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations. Very well recommended!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT AND EVEN BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Will use them again!</li>
    <li> good price. great quality</li>
    <li> As usual, all Edens Garden Essential oils are great!</li>
    <li> Love all the oils!! Wished they weren&#x27;t do pricey but I guess one pays good money for good products. Like natural products</li>
    <li> I love this kit! It has everything I wanted and I have had nothing but wonderful results with Eden Gardens so far.</li>
    <li> Great gift for a friend.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> Love them! Just starting to get into essential oils.</li>
    <li> We have been pleased with this blend of oils.  First time users.  It seems as though the oils are helping us fight off a cold bug that is trying to invade our family.</li>
    <li> I received this great set for Christmas this year and put it to work during the cold and flu season! This was my first time using this brand and I really like it. Good quality. I believe it has helped my family with cold ailments so far. I am having fun making all kinds of recipes with them too!</li>
    <li> Love these oils.  Will purchase more!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils!! highly recommend!! this was an AWESOME way to start with their oils!!!</li>
    <li> Love all of these oils!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and good products</li>
    <li> This kit is great I use it almost everyday!!!</li>
    <li> I have just started to get into the essential oils and the companies that I knew of were just too expensive for my taste. In desperation I went to amazon and took a look. I found this set from Edens Garden and loved the price. so I decided to give it a try. I have been so happy with this purchase.  14 10mml bottles for about half the price of the well known companies you can&#x27;t beat it.  I have used the oils already for aroma therapy, for easing cough and other things.  I am now looking to find other ways to use the oils.  I also know that in the future I will be buying more oils from this company. they have a great selection and their prices can not be beat.  I highly recommend this kit and this company. you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Great Essential Oils Starter kit!</li>
    <li> Great kit with all you need to start or replenish your set.  I really like them just as well as the expensive brands!  I did a lot of research before I purchased and this is the best value  and product for your money.</li>
    <li> I have just started to use Essential Oils and I highly recommend that others do as well. I suffer from Migraines (at least 1 a week) and started researching what to use. The first night that I received the set I used the Eucalyptus oil (a couple dabs across my forehead) and was amazed that it helped.</li>
    <li> Box could have been better, but good oils</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and great product.</li>
    <li> Product is awesome. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Oils seem to be good so far. Delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, delivered as advertized. They seem to work in a vaporizer without a problem.</li>
    <li> after trying a few sub-par (and over priced) essential oil brands.. My entire family is now loyal to Edens Garden. Their oils are of great strength and quality and you always know what you&#x27;re getting.. Not smoke and mirrors. The sub-species of plants used are the most therapeutic available (example: a lot of companies have weaker strands of plants as their oil sources.. Not edens!). The prices are great, the quality rocks.. Just order it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the First Aid Essential Oil set! How can you beat this value?! I&#x27;ve already recommended these oils to multiple people.</li>
    <li> Great product-- I have been using these and enjoying being more proactive in my healthcare-- also, less pharmacy dependent.</li>
    <li> or a bite from the weather, this is a great kit to have on hand many of the oils you may have separately... I personally love having them in their own box with several suggestions for each oil that I can just grab and go! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this kit.</li>
    <li> I was on pins and needles waiting for this package to arrive as treating my severe allergy attack with these oils was my last resort. It should have been my first!! After purchasing both Claritin and Musinex Allergy (at $25/ea mind you) and neither of them even took the edge off for me. I&#x27;ve been having to ice my eyes because of how swollen they&#x27;ve gotten with allergies. Anyway my package came quick and I immediately rubbed 2 drops of lavender on my cheek bones and forehead, peppermint on my collar bone and inhaled lemon, peppermint and lavender &amp; I instantly felt relief. I am so happy I finally got these and I&#x27;m convinced they will become a vital part of my household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was warned by others to only buy doterra oils and I knew they had a business model I wasn&#x27;t interested in paying for. These oils are just as good as the doterra I&#x27;ve used and they are much better priced. Not to mention 10% proceeds are donated. I&#x27;m completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> I just started with oils and these are a fabulous deal, and 100% therapeutic grade, not like some of the fake ones, thanks again</li>
    <li> This was  agreat value and set.  This company makes great oils.  Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> those new to essential oils this is great, it has almost everything you need for general purposes, buy panaway if pain,  and a book on how to use the stuff, there is a nifty guide in the box for how they suggest, so if you have a friend that is just getting into oils this is a nice gift.</li>
    <li> I purchased the first Aid Essential Oil Set in order to begin my journey into learning about essential oils (EOs).  I did expect to get some sort of beginner booklet or something with this box which is not there.  I do not know why I thought it would come with a book though.  The lid of the box is somewhat like buying a box of chocolates.  The lid tells you what is in the box and under the listed name are one or two possible ailments that the EO can be used to cure or help mannage.  When my shipment arrived I thought there were broken or opened bottles that must have seeped out.  The aroma of herbs wafted up when I opened the box.  Nothing was broken, and I am happy to be on my way toward a better knowledge of EOs.  Since there was no booklet in the box I ordered a booked titled, &amp;#34;Aromatherapy &amp; Essential Oils: handbook for everyday wellness&amp;#34;  I have high hopes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used essential oils for 20 years plus. I used to believe that Young Living was the only way to go, but price is nearly prohibitive. I&#x27;ve since exploited many other manufacturers and these stand up to the best of them. Great deal too! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these oils.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first set of Edens Garden oils in 2014 when a friend let me in on this little secret and I am hooked! My 3 small children ages 6,6,5 love them and use them nightly. Amazing product! My first review on Amazon EVER bc I really can&#x27;t hold back this secret. Everyone ENJOY!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying learning to use the essential oils. Oh my some of them smell so good. I also got a diffuser to use. Awesome! One of the bottles leaked and the company (Edens Garden) quickly replaced it. Wonderful customer service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to using EO but so far I love it. This is a better deal than buying them individually. I think every mom should have this.</li>
    <li> This IS medicine! I love this stuff, works awesome! One of the few companies I trust with EO&#x27;s but without the pyramid company structure.  Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still new to oils, but really happy with my decision to use these oils vs. The name brand very very expensive ones! Work great in my diffuser!</li>
    <li> Grrrreat starter kit!!!! üòÄ My big, strong, sexy man isn&#x27;t it to the whole, &amp;#34;essentials oils,&amp;#34; crap, but when I rubbed birch oil with a lil coconut oil (as the carrier oil) on his pulled shoulder muscle, even he had to agree... Essential oils are pretty amazing! üòâ I put peppermint on my tongue to ease my forever aching belly. Ginger, lavender and a carrier oil rub it all up on your feet and it helps to keep you relaxed. üòä I just love this kit!!!! üòç</li>
    <li> Great!  Love these oils!</li>
    <li> I love every oil in this set.  Very high quality and I will buy from Eden&#x27;s Garden again!  Great starter kit for someone new to EO.</li>
    <li> good variety and seem to do well.</li>
    <li> Love this set! Great way ti get started</li>
    <li> I Love this set. Arrived very fast, and exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Edens Garden essential oils are superb and in my opinion the BEST essential oils of  all!  The cost is extremely reasonable.  Edens Garden surpasses quality, cost and packaging over ANY other essential oil company.  I have had oils from the younger and livelier companies and I always go back to EDENS GARDEN.</li>
    <li> This is a great little set. I found them to be very high quality oils, and they work well! I like the variety in the set, and have had fun creating recipes for allergies, congestion, neck pain, and stress relief. I also appreciated the price on this set. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Pleased with the selection.</li>
    <li> This set is awesome. Bought it for my daughter for Christmas and thankfully she is sharing with me. This was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am so looking forward to learning how to use essential oils for all my needs.  This is a great product and was shipped quick, faster than expected.</li>
    <li> nice assortment for a starter kit, decent quality</li>
    <li> These are so nice for the price!!! Love these oils! They have worked wonders!</li>
    <li> I received this product promptly and in excellent condition. The oils smell very nice and the customer service at Eden&#x27;s Garden is fantastic!</li>
    <li> The oils seem to be good quality. Eden&#x27;s Garden has a good selection and quality for the price.  The item shipped quickly and as ordered.</li>
    <li> Got these last year at Christmas ....since then have used in many saves and sprays! Great oils!</li>
    <li> Out of all the box,  I have 3 aromas that I&#x27;m in love with.  the other ones not so much but its a great starter kid.</li>
    <li> Yes I really these oils.</li>
    <li> very nice quick delivery.</li>
    <li> The quality of your essential oils is by far more than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;selinao</li>
    <li> I love the Edens garden oils.</li>
    <li> Great oils.  I diffuse them daily, and especially enjoy the Synergy Blends.  I&#x27;ve made multiple orders now.  Shipment was fast and really, these oils are great for the price and compare equally as well to the other higher end names.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of oils. I&#x27;ve used doTerra oils and they smell much nicer. I also emailed the company because I was on fire in a few seconds after applying the oil to my skin. I purchased the oils to apply them on my daughter. There is no way I will use them on her.  i will not buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with quality of oils</li>
    <li> I bought these as an introduction to essential oils for my daughter so that she could begin making her own baby products for her new daughter. She LOVES them. And Edens Garden is a company I have learned to rely on for great oils at a really good price.</li>
    <li> I love these oils!  This is my first set of essential oils and I love the selections in this package.  Eden Garden has excellent customer service and and awesome website!  I highly recommend the First Aid Essential Oil set!</li>
    <li> I think this was a great starter kit. The ginger warmed cold toes really nice and the frankincense helped my headache go away when rubbed on temples.</li>
    <li> My package somehow got stuck between the time it was labeled shipped and it actually made it to USPS for over a week, but aside form the annoying delay it is great. I am only including this because SO many people said it was shipping super fast and they got it in days. Mine had shipping tracking the day I ordered, but didn&#x27;t actually start tracking with USPS until a week later. Once it got to USPS it was shipped in a flat rate envelope and got here in 2 days. Yes a $5 flat rate envelope with a bubble mailer inside containing the oils for $9 in shipping. Not a fan of this, but the shipping cost is based on price you spend on product, so I guess it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been using the breathe easy almost obsessively mixed into coconut oil and rubbed onto chests and feel since the flu and colds are running rampant in the school and at church here. It hasn&#x27;t stopped us from getting colds, but it does help thin mucus to prevent coughing and allow the kiddos to sleep and in my opinion helped prevent sinus infections. I don&#x27;t love all the oils in this set, but considering the cost for one bottle from some of the MLM oil companies, its still a better deal. I actually have a few people that have asked where I get my oils because they have paid $50 for just one small bottle of oils in the past. As for diffusing, I have found a wax warmer works a lot better for aromatherapy uses than a hot mist humidifier unless I literally have my head over the humidifier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves the Ginger essential oil for tummy aches</li>
    <li> I have always found these oils to be high quality and they have a great selection and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit for using essential oils and economical.</li>
    <li> I had been researching brands that would be similar quality to DoTerra and Young Living, and this is definitely it! This was my first purchase from Edens Garden, but it certainly won&#x27;t be my last! My only word of advice is to go to their site and order. This is $49.99 with $5.99 shipping when ordered directly through them (although I did get my package via Amazon within 4-5 days).</li>
    <li> Great price and quality</li>
    <li> This first aid kit is all your home medicine cabinet needs!</li>
    <li> Wonderful high quality oils here. I use a few brands and these are on par. Will be buying more. :)</li>
    <li> Great product! The oils are easy to use and comes with a handy guide. I&#x27;m a beginner in the essential oil world, so this kit was perfect to get started.</li>
    <li> I think Edens Garden has the very best essential oils in the world.I have tried hundreds as I am a self proclaimed herbalist and pretty good at it! Ha Ha  The oils are very potent a true to form and proper consistancy and last longer in my cool mist vaporizers ,of any I have tried.They are also Pharmacutical Grade and I am a Breast Cancer patient so I use them for nausea ,depression,sleeplessness etc... They work much safer and better than all the unnatural drugs out there for such serious illness. They also are great working with their clients (really great) I had a entire 54.00 kit delivered at Christmas man handled by the horrific rush in which one bottle was broken and had soiled the box and remaining intact bottles! I emailed Edens Garden they ask for a picture of damage and then sent me a entire new set! Did not even have me return the old set. Now that is customer service! Love them and their terrific essentials.  Sincerly impressed,Rachel Bata</li>
    <li> Very good assortment at a good price</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Eden&#x27;s Garden!  These products are very comparable to doTerra. In fact, I prefer these because I cannot tell a difference and the price cannot be beat.  All of the oils that I have ordered from them have been fantastic.  I did have a few questions about their products and their customer service is fantastic as well.  Great company, great products!</li>
    <li> bought it as a gift for the wifey and uses it all the time. we&#x27;ve had it for half a year now and she still finds uses for it.</li>
    <li> wish I could pick my own set &#x3D;0/&lt;br /&gt;great products</li>
    <li> Great value! These seem very pure, strong and effective. I diffuse these a good bit and my whole family enjoys them. I own some from DoTerra as well as Mountain Rose Herbs and have been pleasantly surprised with these oils.</li>
    <li> I love the presentation of the product.  The informational items sent with the set was helpful, as I am new to the world of EO&#x27;s.  I ordered this so I would have a nice introduction to the first aid products.  I have used the eucalyptus oil for congestion; lavender for bug bite relief; birch for pain relief in my lower back; peppermint on cotton balls for spider repellent; &amp; stress relief for calming (love this smell!).  I am pleased that they are doing what they said they would!&lt;br /&gt;Getting ready to order the Synergy Set of 14 next!!!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I, too, started with YL oils for back and shoulder pain and nerve damage from an old injury.  I&#x27;ve found Align and Muscle Relief provide comparable relief. The peppermint oil &amp;#34;chaser&amp;#34; after those oils do deepen and hasten the effect.  PS:  I also use 3 drops of this peppermint oil with hot water as a tea.  It works great for me!</li>
    <li> Pure perfection!  Nice complete set . Will order again.</li>
    <li> A great starter set essential oils. Everything you need to keep your family healthy or your house clean and wonderful smelling. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price compared to the other brands, these are a great quality and work just as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for Hanukkah for my mom and she loved it. It is a great starter kit and the scents are amazing! Came packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> highly recommend!!! heard about it from a friend and highly recommend! was a Doterra lover but this will be the new oils i buy from now on.&lt;br /&gt;i like how they recommend other oils that would be similar to what Doterra offers!</li>
    <li> Package came as expected, product looks amazing!</li>
    <li> Very happy with thequality ! Fast delivery.Will be buying more !</li>
    <li> I got it in 4 days! Im really excited.</li>
    <li> Great customer service but gave me a headache the minute after  I turned on diffuser, trying YL hope  I wont have the same issue after  kit gets here</li>
    <li> Good product as advertised. Will order from this company again. Descent prices.</li>
    <li> Love this! It is my first set. I used the ginger on a stomache, and it was gone in less than 5 minutes. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit for anyone into or is starting to get into essentials orders.  Great value, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Just received this &amp; I really like. I have used doTerra, but could not afford ti re-order from them this time. So far seem pretty close in comparison to doTerra. Will order again!!</li>
    <li> Just bought the first aide set. Upon arriving, I loved the smells of all of them. I have been using and testing other oils and this is my first purchase of Eden&#x27;s garden. I am excited to use frankincense on my plantar fasciitis. I have used lavender for almost everything and used Eden&#x27;s garden for the first time for cold and sleep. In just one day I will say it DID work! I think the prices are very affordable and that is a big plus for me. I will see if they work and if so will be ordering much much more from this company. The company seems solid and I have researched how the oils are extracted and am very happy with the information.</li>
    <li> Excellent oils and great prices. I like their attitude toward helping earth-friendly efforts from their profits and allowing us to buy direct. I&#x27;ve compared a dozen or more essential oil vendors and they simply don&#x27;t compete. There&#x27;s either major price differences or upon closer inspection of their competitors&#x27; descriptions, their oils are diluted. I&#x27;ve made several orders with them and will continue to do so. Great value for the investment!! Website is also easy to navigate...</li>
    <li> I really like the essential oils</li>
    <li> Love these oils! Great price. Delivered quickly. Have referred friends to buy this item!</li>
    <li> Affordable without the compromise of quality.  I wish it was sold through Amazon so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay shipping on something so small, but I will continue to do so because they work fantastic!  I never used essential oils before and now I swear by them.</li>
    <li> I love my oils. You can not beat the quality for the price. This will be the only place I get my essential oils.</li>
    <li> A really thorough kit. Great for beginners.</li>
    <li> i AM AMAZED WITH THESE ESSENTIAL OILS!  They have helped me sleep at night and had helped minimize my cold symptoms.  I am a believer!</li>
    <li> Wow, wow!!! I bought this for myself &amp; then for my friend whose baby was going into the hospital for surgery. Since then I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on essential oils &amp; have tried several. I can&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t tried them sooner. Smells have a way of changing your entire outlook &amp; stare of mind/heart; they&#x27;re so powerful. But beyond that, what if there are some plants with inherent medicinal value? The more I use these the more convinced I am that they actually do have the ability to heal. I&#x27;ll still take OTC medicine for muscle or head aches but essential oils are a wonderful supplement. Sometimes I&#x27;ve been able to avoid taking any drugs. They truly do help with insomnia - tremendously! You&#x27;ll also want a carrier oil (like jojoba - or diluted vitamin E oil). It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
    <li> Love them use them for yoga and at home. They seem pure and not diluted.  Great price</li>
    <li> As a massage therapist I always try looking for the purest oils I can find. I started with Young Living oils and was very satisfied, they are stronger then most essential oils you find elsewhere such as a whole foods. The downside of YL was the price, it costs about 170-180 dollars for the set. I then did my research and found Edens Gardern, said why not let&#x27;s try it! I got them In the mail today and compared the lavender and peppermint from both YL and EG. I&#x27;ve got to say I am impressed, after using YL oils you smell other oils and they don&#x27;t smell as potent, but the Edens Garden First Aid set matches up to the potency of the YL. I am satisfied as I have already diffused the EG oils in my ultrasonic diffuser and they smell great. I will be sure to return and keep buying these oils for the great affordable price to use on my clients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils and decided after doing some research to try Edens Garden.  I knew I was taking a gamble as they are so much cheaper than YL or Doterra, and quality makes a difference in EOs.  I was pleasantly surprised to find these to be of decent quality, and have used them to make blends, soap, cleaners, salves, and lotions as well as diffusing them.  I had a stuffy nose last week so I mixed the Thieves with a carrier oil and put it on the soles of my feet that night and the next day woke up clear and not feeling like I was &amp;#34;coming down&amp;#34; with something anymore.  I compared the scent with some YL oils from a friend, and I did notice a difference in quality, but as someone who&#x27;s new to the world of EOs it didn&#x27;t justify the 3x price difference.  The advantage in Young Living oils is that they are advertised as being able to be taken internally, and Edens Garden is not.  According to their website they cannot recommend for ingestion but said that they have many customers who do with no problems.  Because of this I took off a star, but I&#x27;m satisfied with this product especially for the price.  They arrived promptly and packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is ac concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden‚Äôs Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can‚Äôt afford the network marketing prices and aren‚Äôt making any money have tried and like Eden‚Äôs Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden‚Äôs Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> Great product arrived on time and was as promised by seller. I have found Edens Gardens Essential Oil to be excellent quality and great value and will continue to by more of their wonderful essential oils in the future.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at great price.  Bottles are larger than I expected and have the lid for one drop portions.  Includes Frankincense which generally cost more than this whole set combined.  LOVE it.  Bought one for me and one for my mom.  As with all essential oils do not take internally unless you know it is safe to do so.  Some need carrier oils as they are concentrated and can burn or irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing oils with very different and soothing oils! I bought this for the home and my dad who&#x27;s recovering from cancer! I love the oils and so does he. We use them in a diffuser!</li>
    <li> I ordered this great &amp;#34;First Aid&amp;#34; set plus a few additional bottles.&lt;br /&gt;My order was correct and was processed and shipped very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;(In this case, I ordered evening of 13th, order arrived 16th!)&lt;br /&gt;I also received with my order a product guide for Edens Garden that is very informative to products and uses and a pamphlet &amp;#34;101 ways to use essential oils&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy and won&#x27;t hesitate to order from EG again, most likely this evening.. after I get a good look at the product guide. : )</li>
    <li> Awesome set!  Coming back for more!!  These oils work!!!</li>
    <li> Merchandise is exactly as described, love them &amp; use them constantly. Thanks for a smooth transaction. Excellent deal, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excited to use them. This is my first time using essential oils and I was unaware that I would have to purchase a separate carrier oil for many of the uses. It would be nice if that was included in the package.</li>
    <li> Love these oils!  Enjoy them not only diffused, but also topically.  Have found them to be very helpful for aches and pains and for cleaning.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of oils and they have been great.  I am learning more and able to utilize them for additional uses daily. This brand is high quality.</li>
    <li> One bottle leaked all over everything.</li>
    <li> Just got these in and glad I ordered. Just as described</li>
    <li> Very good assortment.  Small bottles.  For the price I was kind of disappointed how small they were.</li>
    <li> Wonderful to have at home, the possibility are endless and the luxury of those oil are fantastic , thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Lavender so far, but it has given me a piece of mind to know I have the kit on hand for any minor burns or cuts.</li>
    <li> I really love essential oils! I am extremely happy with this set. There are a few that I do not use as often as the others. I need to get sick already so that I can try them! Having this set only encouraged me to order more!</li>
    <li> Love these oils awesome quality,fast shipping great customer service.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and love it!</li>
    <li> These oils aren&#x27;t quite the caliber of Young Living or Doterra, but they nonetheless are effective in doing the job. They are certainly not the cheap oils you find everywhere. These are a quality product that are a good option if you don&#x27;t have the budget for the outrageously priced top end oils. I especially like this set, it&#x27;s the most practical of the offerings.</li>
    <li> a nice collection at a price that fits our budget.</li>
    <li> Really like this set of essential oils, it has a lot of the oils that are good for every day use. The oils are of excellent quality and the best I have found. I can&#x27;t say enough for this seller.  My order got lost in the mail (not the sellers fault) and they responded quickly and replaced my order with no questions ask.  I will be ordering lots more essential oils from them in the future and hope you will too.</li>
    <li> These oils are excellent quality and amazingly priced! I have had such good luck with all of them! I have purchased several of the sets, along with many single oils. I had wonderful luck with the frankincense oil. After my baby was born I use frank on her cord stump, and it got loose within 4 days and fell off on the 5th day! it healed it beautifully! My other children&#x27;s cords took approx. 2 weeks if not a bit longer to fall off. Great oils!!!</li>
    <li> I like to have these 14 different possibilities available to me. I am happy with the quality of the oils. I am very happy with the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new at using essential oils. This seems to be a great kit for a newbie. So far I&#x27;ve used several, they seem to be good oils.</li>
    <li> I have used a few of theses oils. The lavender is a little strong for me. The thieves oil is amazing. I got a fever blister and I applied it twice the first day and it was dried up and scabbed the next morning. Tea tree oil mixed with coconut oil makes for an amazing facial wash specially if you have break outs. I&#x27;m still experimenting with the rest!!</li>
    <li> I bought three of these, one for myself and my daughters. LOVE it! Can&#x27;t say enough good about the quality and smell of these oils. Company is better than do terra where it&#x27;s like a pyramid scam to get their oils. Thank you Eden Gardens! My daughters have also reported great results, I&#x27;ve bought separate oils for them too and the night time solution is awesome. They helped my daughters PMS symptoms greatly!</li>
    <li> great set very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Loved this!  I am really enjoying using the oils for many things.  The &#x27;Breathe Easier&#x27; blend was amazing for my sinuses with my last respiratory infection.  My kids love it too and are now calling to say they need me to make up one of my &#x27;magic potions&#x27; for them.</li>
    <li> I received this oil set as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift. I wanted something that I could use to treat every member of my family with so my medicine cabinet wasn&#x27;t so full.  This is EXACTLY that. I use these oils EVERY SINGLE DAY. Let me explain. My son is 11 months old and was born with respiratory issues. He has had bronchitis 4 times already. we use the breathe easier blend along with four theives in a diffuser everyday. It helps him breathe, and helps boost his immune system. And at night I mix 6-9 drops of carrier oil with one drop each of breathe and lavender and he imhas started sleeping through the night (FINALLY!) and doesn&#x27;t wake up coughing every few hrs. I also use a mixer of peppermint and lavender on myself for headaches during the days when he is incredibly fussy due to teething. I would 100% recommend this product to anyone who wants a chemical free way to treat their family</li>
    <li> Please be careful with EG oils, Eden&#x27;s Garden - FAILED for Cypriol. Contained 5.38% DEP which is toxic. All of the their other oils are reported to be ok. However, there are numerous other issues with the company, including mislabeling. Please see the document &amp;#34;Summarizing the Issues with Eden&#x27;s Garden in the Files section.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my first aid kit! I put these in my on the go and I&#x27;m ready for just about anything!</li>
    <li> I love Edens Garden oils. This set is great because on the lid it explains each oil and how you can use it. With other companies you are just given the oil and left to figure out what to do with the oil. Not Edens Garden. They also have pamphlets to guide you on your journey with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely abs so far I am happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Awesome starter set. I have used Doterra a few times in the past and Edens Garden seems to be of thw same great quality and for a great price. Thanks EG! Now I don&#x27;t have to go broke to keeps family healthy.</li>
    <li> I love my eden&#x27;s garden oils and I love the price and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between them and Doterra.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the blend ingredients were listed somewhere either on the actual bottle or in the packaging that came with them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve diffused them and rid one room of pet odors, put my kids to sleep better with lavender, made my own deodorant, cured diaper rash, dry skin, etc</li>
    <li> Excellent product and really excellent price compared to many other essential oils on the market.</li>
    <li> These oils are excellent!! I love learning about what each one does. They seem to be of good quality. I know I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Great stuff... Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality oils. Highly recommend them</li>
    <li> Great product and fantastic service</li>
    <li> All of the oils received were very high grade and we use them all constantly, baths, diffuser and mixed with a carrier oil in the roll on applicators. They have replaced a lot of our other home remedies i.e. skin care, sore muscles, colds, stuffy noses, headaches etc.. My wife even uses some of the oils for cramps with great results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying these essential oils.  First time user.</li>
    <li> Perfect starter kit! Love it!</li>
    <li> Lots of basic scented oils.  Wonderful fragrances and a broad range of oils.  A very nice way to buy several oils, learn their uses, and mix/match them to your satisfaction.  Extremely cost effective way to get a basic set of essential oils with many of the best oils included.  It would be hard to beat this pricing for these high-quality oils buying them individually or from other providers.  They come with a booklet explaining many of the uses for the oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are not oil &amp;#34;aficionados&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;zealots&amp;#34;, but we do use them consistently both for scent and personal health.  One example:  I am approaching my 6th decade... had a lesion (like a scab or wart) pop up in my head hair.  I am not sure what it was as I could feel it, but not see it... felt like a wart or scab about 2 inches above my hairline.  It did not go away for about 3-4 weeks as a healing scab would.  But seemed to grow. I did not hit or cut my head.  Before running off to the doc, I simply began applying Frankincense to it... a drop at night and a drop in the morning.  Within about 2 weeks it had completely disappeared and the skin was hole and healthy.  I have had success with Frankincense for a wart on my foot, so I am guessing that is what it was... in any case it is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this set of oils if you are trying to get a set of high-quality oils for personal use without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> Great starter set! High Quality oils!</li>
    <li> I will continue to order from you this is a wonderful product and I use them daily</li>
</ol>
