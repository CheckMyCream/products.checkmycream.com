    <li> Thanks you. Everything was alright. I live in Venezuela and I&#x60;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I wear retainers at night. 5 minutes with Polident and they are sparkling clean and fresh smelling. However, the vendor took a long time to get this to me - 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> We use the Polident cleanser tablets all the time for cleaning my dentures and my wife&#x27;s bridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to find a product that works great all the time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and now that I can buy it in bulk from Amazon, I don&#x27;t have to add it to my list every month.  It just shows up.  Happy, happy, happy!</li>
    <li> Nice and works. No after taste.</li>
    <li> On subscription, because I have all my teeth, my hubby and sis don&#x27;t, since I do the shopping, guess what always got forgotten?&lt;br /&gt;Yep.  Now they have plenty on hand for those great smiles.</li>
    <li> It came in a timely way and with enough supply for the foreseeable future.  I make the purchase again without reservations.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time.. works great</li>

MAGIC!</li>
