      <li>She was thrilled and says it is comparable to Gelish.</li>
      <li>I do use Gelish foundation and top coat along with these colors and I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>and i  am going to order some more colors as well....</li>
      <li>Once you have learned to perfect the gel application it last for an appropriate amount of time.</li>
      <li>Love this brand.</li>
      <li>Thumbs up, we just need more variety with colors when it comes to this BMC 6pc set.</li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s ok to try.</li>
      <li>I love all of the colors and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
      <li>excellent gel, would have preferred a larger gamut of colors to choose from</li>
      <li>Most gel polishes are around $17 for just one color.</li>
      <li>so I can get two or more weeks out of the color.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I bought more then just this pack of gel polishes.</li>
      <li>I love the color that i ordered, easy to put on my boyfriend like my nails</li>
      <li>its ok, peels off easy.</li>
      <li>I decided to try  BMC, the colors are beautiful and the quality is nearly as good as gelish for half the price.</li>
      <li>I just love the quality and consistency of the application, my favorite color is the rich</li>
      <li>We have enjoyed experimenting with all the fun colors!  </li>
      <li>Taking it off is also easy.</li>
      <li>and they look fine.</li>
      <li>I use them with the Royal Nails UV Light (which I also purchased on Amazon).</li>
      <li>I  tried on the blue and it works great.</li>
      <li>These are six regular size bottles, not mini&#x27;s and the colors are great.</li>
      <li>Super satisfied with the product especially with a amazing price like that!</li>
      <li>I originally assumed that it would have some issues with the product, however no issues here.</li>
      <li>It was very simple, if you know how to use regular nail polish you will do great with this product; two coats of this and you will be very satisfied.</li>
      <li>and I have also had my nails professional done using OPI nail polish and this polish has lasted BETTER than OPI!</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t too impressed the black with glitter, navy blue, violet purple and brown were nice.</li>
      <li>but overall good colors.</li>
      <li>satisfied with the purchase, really like</li>
      <li>Red carpet polishes retail for $10 a bottle and the BMC is just as good</li>
      <li>In fact i got one full weeks with this product.</li>
      <li>stars because atleast it looks cool.</li>
      <li>its true</li>
      <li>I used the mauve color (in the middle) and its a good neutral color.</li>
      <li>These are full size</li>
      <li>All the colors are beautiful and just the other night I used the black with the sparkle and it turned out great.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and as described online.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>The blue is more purple and the purple is more like a rose color and the one that is supposed to be gun mettle was more of a green with gold glitter in it.</li>
      <li>The top coat dries instantly when cured under my uv light.</li>
      <li>I have used it so far...only 4 stars because it is much more smelly than most other gels I have used.</li>
      <li>which is what I wanted the most - it is more pearly dark pumpkin orange</li>
      <li>my nails dyed quick under the UV light and so far look just like the first time i applied it.</li>
      <li>- is pretty but not neon at</li>
      <li>color did not last for more than a day ...</li>
      <li>- we were pretty bummed out by it</li>
      <li>I tried the white and purple colors and I love them.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>The colors were exactly as pictured online and on the bottles.</li>
      <li>I ordered this, and I asked the person if they would throw in a light, they said yes if i paid a little more.</li>
      <li>I purchased this set back in Feb-Mar of this year, I loved it so much I bought a second set.</li>
      <li>I really like this set</li>
      <li>My nails grow fast with the polish on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;they don&#x27;t stay on very well either</li>
      <li>so u have to have some times 3 coats, and that can be very time consuming when working with gel polish.</li>
      <li>The only downside is I thought it came with a light</li>
      <li>so that makes it easier to apply or fix when ready to change out.</li>
      <li>You should be following the EXACT same directions as any other gel manicure and you should get great results.  </li>
      <li>I already have the Red Carpet base and top coats (which are wonderful).</li>
      <li>I am so shocked and impressed!</li>
      <li>I was so surprised by the quality of this product!</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the description clearly.</li>
      <li>the colors aren&#x27;t really too neon - especially the orange</li>
      <li>The quality is professional grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s well worth the every penny spent.</li>
      <li>only needed 2 coats for a complete cover.</li>
      <li>I bought the same brand base and top coat thinking they would work better together</li>
      <li>The bottles do indicate the same colors as online, but after applied, are far different.</li>
      <li>Compared to other brands this was decent.  </li>
      <li>They all worked just fine although the pink was a bit thick and goopy compared to the others.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best quality and received 3 days after</li>
    <li> I tried this brand again and must say that I was impressed that it lasted well over two days. In fact i got one full weeks with this product. No chipping for one week is all that i want. Taking it off is also easy.</li>
    <li> Great polish and a great price!</li>
    <li> beautiful colors works good with my sally Hansen light ! Super satisfied with the product especially with a amazing price like that!</li>
    <li> I bought the same brand base and top coat thinking they would work better together however the color tends to migrate to the center and does not stay on the sides of the nails, its a little weird. but overall good colors. PS don&#x27;t pay attention to the sticker colors, for some reason the stickers all look the same. But they are not. The silver is also not silver but actually a glittery black color.</li>
    <li> I bought more then just this pack of gel polishes. The color falls off the base coat. &amp;trudy me I prep prime and eliminate cuticles. It&#x27;s just tricky polish. When I cute the base it stays tacky which I figured helps the polish stick. The top coat dries instantly when cured under my uv light. So I guess it&#x27;s just the polish buy it if you want to learn but not to do clients nails. I avoide using the colors and just use my glitter set but it takes a il to prep it when they peel the next day</li>
    <li> The gel shrinks to the center if the basil when curing</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller</li>
    <li> Great collection of colors at a great price. We have enjoyed experimenting with all the fun colors!  I am extremely pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Regular nail polish last longer than this crap</li>
    <li> These are six regular size bottles, not mini&#x27;s and the colors are great. I used the mauve color (in the middle) and its a good neutral color.</li>
    <li> All the colors are beautiful and just the other night I used the black with the sparkle and it turned out great. The only downside is I thought it came with a light but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the description clearly.</li>
    <li> The colors were a bit off on some of them. The blue is more purple and the purple is more like a rose color and the one that is supposed to be gun mettle was more of a green with gold glitter in it. They all worked just fine although the pink was a bit thick and goopy compared to the others. Besides the slightly wrong color they worked well.</li>
    <li> PRO:&lt;br /&gt;1. The quality is professional grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. It arrived late&lt;br /&gt;2. The colors are not true to what they are advertised. The only one that is correct is the white. I have used all of the colors, and they are literally all drastically different than what is shown online besides the white. The bottles do indicate the same colors as online, but after applied, are far different.</li>
    <li> The colors were exactly as pictured online and on the bottles. I have used them all and they work just as well as the expensive nail colors. Arrived quickly. Exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I got the nail polish about 3 days ago. I  tried on the blue and it works great. my nails dyed quick under the UV light and so far look just like the first time i applied it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely an amazing product. I always bought the gelish brand but its so pricey. I decided to try  BMC, the colors are beautiful and the quality is nearly as good as gelish for half the price. I will never go back to buying any other brand.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It stats on longer than any other gell polish I have used.  I would buy this product again. Defenetly a good buy</li>
    <li> I ordered this, and I asked the person if they would throw in a light, they said yes if i paid a little more. Just got it today, no light. I will NEVER buy from this seller again, So, if you don&#x27;t want to be ripped off, don&#x27;t buy from her, she is not worth it.</li>
    <li> Worked well! Gel polish lasted 2 weeks, and my hands get a lot of wear and tear. The colors are a little different than they appear in the images, but they are close enough. Would definitely buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Great colors and a WONDERFUL price for all you get. I love them!</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE INTERNALLY.  My privates have been stained for over a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars because atleast it looks cool.</li>
    <li> This was my second brand of soak off nail polish purchased.  I got the basic color set and they look fine. It does shrink/pull a little during application so I do a couple of nails and then cure for the base coat. These are full size so it&#x27;s a very good price for the set.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set back in Feb-Mar of this year, I loved it so much I bought a second set. I originally assumed that it would have some issues with the product, however no issues here. I just love the quality and consistency of the application, my favorite color is the rich blue.&lt;br /&gt;These uv gel colors are incased in a class polish bottle (which is how uv colors should be kept) I have purchased little pots of uv gel colors and i have to say I prefer this to any of those. It was very simple, if you know how to use regular nail polish you will do great with this product; two coats of this and you will be very satisfied. I do use Gelish foundation and top coat along with these colors and I am very pleased. Thumbs up, we just need more variety with colors when it comes to this BMC 6pc set.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as described online.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter-in-law. She was thrilled and says it is comparable to Gelish.</li>
    <li> meh....its ok, peels off easy.</li>
    <li> This nail polish isn&#x27;t horrible but not great, a little hard to work with, the green chipped off pretty fast.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t wore all colors yet but the ones I have are very attractive. I am learning each time I pick a color on a betterppication so I can get two or more weeks out of the color. The product comes off in hole not chip so that makes it easier to apply or fix when ready to change out. My nails grow fast with the polish on. I have noticed that my cuticles are dry an cracked.</li>
    <li> The polish works GREAT! I use them with the Royal Nails UV Light (which I also purchased on Amazon). I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them at all. They last a very long time without any chipping!</li>
    <li> excellent gel, would have preferred a larger gamut of colors to choose from</li>
    <li> I really like this set and it stayed on for 2 weeks both times I have used it so far...only 4 stars because it is much more smelly than most other gels I have used. I would order again because it is a good value.</li>
    <li> These are low quality gel polishes. Some of the colours go on well but others are difficult to apply - too goopy and colour is inconsistent. For the price, it&#x27;s ok to try.</li>
    <li> Compared to other brands this was decent.  A little thick than the Gelish brand but worked well for the price</li>
    <li> The product is inconsistent and does not cure correctly.  It peels off within 48 after application.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these polishes.</li>
    <li> I only need to use one coat of this brand.</li>
    <li> Love this brand. Once you have learned to perfect the gel application it last for an appropriate amount of time. The colors are great and for the price it&#x27;s well worth the every penny spent.</li>
    <li> I love the color that i ordered, easy to put on my boyfriend like my nails and i  am going to order some more colors as well....</li>
    <li> Love them because they are not to expensive and is the same quality than others</li>
    <li> A little thin.. but over all theyre great just be sure to prep your nails and use primer</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the neon set because the other one came with white and black and their my faves. This set is great I love all of the colors and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it the quality is awesome too .. I&#x27;m deff ordering from them again</li>
    <li> These colors were great. I&#x27;m planning to order the other pack of neon colors as well. The only problem I had with the polish is that it&#x27;s thin so u have to have some times 3 coats, and that can be very time consuming when working with gel polish.</li>
    <li> color did not last for more than a day ... colors are nice though.. and yes i did everything correctly bc i have applied gels prior to using this product.. its true you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I was so surprised by the quality of this product! I have been using red carpet system and nail polishes for 2 years and I have also had my nails professional done using OPI nail polish and this polish has lasted BETTER than OPI! I am so shocked and impressed! Red carpet polishes retail for $10 a bottle and the BMC is just as good and you get TWICE the product for $6 a bottle! If you are an experience gel polish user than you should have NO ISSUES with this polish. You should be following the EXACT same directions as any other gel manicure and you should get great results.  It has been about 10 days and the polish is showing minimal chipping (ive yet to find a polish that literally last 2 weeks) and the shine is still there! now I will say that i ONLY used the polish. I already have the Red Carpet base and top coats (which are wonderful). However, when im out of the red carpet i will be purchasing the top and base coats from BMC. EXCELLENT VALUE!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t too impressed the black with glitter, navy blue, violet purple and brown were nice. Pink and white don&#x27;t paint so well</li>
    <li> the colors aren&#x27;t really too neon - especially the orange which is what I wanted the most - it is more pearly dark pumpkin orange - is pretty but not neon at all&lt;br /&gt;they don&#x27;t stay on very well either - we were pretty bummed out by it</li>
    <li> I tried the white and purple colors and I love them. They are a tad wattery but after shaking them a bit they cover perfectly. only needed 2 coats for a complete cover. Great product for the price. Will be purchasing more colors from BMC!  UPDATE: after 2 weeks the color is still perfect. No damage anywhere! Used the gelish base, top coat and led lamp. Cured each coat for 45 secs. Love this BMC collection!</li>
    <li> For the price it is a good deal. Most gel polishes are around $17 for just one color. Not as durable as the expensive polishes but worth buying. I also ordered the basic collection and I received the wrong black!</li>
    <li> satisfied with the purchase, really like</li>
