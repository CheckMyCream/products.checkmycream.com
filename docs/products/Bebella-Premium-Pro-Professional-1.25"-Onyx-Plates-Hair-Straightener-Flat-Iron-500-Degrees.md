      <li>I noticed this Bebella brand had good reviews and the plates were ceramic.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s good to have.</li>
      <li>so I started doing research on a good straightener.  </li>
      <li>A good straightener</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t think it is anything exceptional.</li>

      <li>Works nicely.</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely the greatest.</li>
      <li>but it really works, I love it!!!!</li>
      <li>:)  Works exceptionally well.</li>
      <li>Lightweight and very easy to</li>
      <li>I thought the price was too good to be true</li>
      <li>and I use mostly twist outs and braid outs, but when I want to straighten my hair</li>
      <li>They are excellent tutorials and there are multiple ways to do it.  </li>
      <li>works better than chi</li>
      <li>but I thought this would be better since it reaches 500.</li>
      <li>I have managed to handle this by using some more amount of anti-frizz</li>
      <li>However, I have never been able to curl my hair with a straightener like I can with this one</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this, and it comes with a warranty. :)</li>
      <li>but I had to pass it more</li>
      <li>It appears to be OK however without trying it out in Europe I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
      <li>Excellent flat iron for a ridiculously low price - very happy with it!</li>
      <li>I have natural(frizzy)hair, these are the best flat irons I have ever had..</li>
      <li>I am so impressed with this flat iron!</li>
      <li>This is really awesome and gets hot fast, great flat iron and can be used to curl as well love</li>
      <li>I love this straightener and it does a fantastic job.</li>
      <li>Certainly it&#x27;s not the greatest, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for $200, but for $25 or so...</li>
      <li>It warms up quickly and the 1.25&amp;#34; plate is the perfect size allowing me to get as close to my roots as possible.</li>
      <li>in all, it&#x27;s a very good flat ironing for the price.</li>
      <li>Arrived very quick</li>
      <li>I bought it with the HerStyler Easy Comb to adapt to the chase method and now I&#x27;m not passing through my hair 4 and 5 times causing heat damage</li>
      <li>and it packs just fine.</li>
      <li>It heats up super-quick (60 to 90 seconds) and even on the lowest setting it can straighten my hair with one pass (I have fine hair, but there is a lot of it</li>
      <li>it let my hair straight and shiny, but with frizzy static!  </li>
      <li>Like it, just don&#x27;t like the fact that the buttons to measure aren&#x27;t accurate and they&#x27;re in between the plates.</li>
      <li>If you have smooth, curly hair like me</li>
      <li>LOVE this product and at such a good price</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m bi-racial and have very coarse,curly hair and this flat iron works awesome for me.</li>
      <li>Great flat iron.</li>
      <li>it gets extremely hot (the hotter the better).</li>
      <li>I originally ordered this because it is rated for both U.S. and Europe/India voltages with a range of 110V to 240V</li>
      <li>But the best part of this iron is that my hair looks very shiny and healthy after using it and the style lasts all day (except on extremely humid days the straight style still frizzes some, but that&#x27;s more of me not using the right hair products vs. the straightener, I think - plus humidity and curly hair</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still straight and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>i love this product it got my hair so straight.</li>
      <li>AS GOOD AS MY FORMER CHI BRAND STRAIGHTNER.</li>
      <li>I bought it because it was similar to my HSI that I loved</li>
      <li>The part that you hold stays cool to the touch regardless of the heat setting and</li>
      <li>I need to go over the same section only 2-3 times to get a perfect straightening.</li>
      <li>I have owned many straighteners over the years and this one is definitely one of the better ones.  </li>
      <li>cord length is adequate as well.</li>
      <li>Gets very hot.</li>
      <li>It warms up fast and it easy to hold.</li>
      <li>cos my hair looks dry after straightening) BUT still a good product.</li>
      <li>There is also a red light on the top that lets you know</li>
      <li>I would even go so far as to say It works better than my CHI that I had.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>So far I love it.</li>
      <li>Also good for wet hair.</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and straightens effectively on the first or second go-over.</li>
      <li>Until now, I only straightened my hair on special occasions because I didn&#x27;t like how much it damages my hair, but with the lower heat settings I feel like I can style it more often!</li>
      <li>Because I don&#x27;t do my hair regularly, it made more sense to buy a more cost efficient straightener versus a high end $100+ one.</li>
      <li>, it gets it right with maximum two passes through and it gets my roots/kitchen.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling as soft and smooth as other irons have or glide very smoothly over my hair, but it does heat up quickly and is easy to hold and use.  </li>
      <li>The cord is a good length, not too long so as it catch on things but not to short so as to prevent you from easily maneuvering with it.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly,  heats up fast and I&#x27;m about to try it out.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if my old straightener was going &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; for longer than I thought, but I can&#x27;t remember the last time it did as good a job as the Bebella does.  </li>
      <li>Heats up super fast.</li>
      <li>Loved it any does the job, just got to be careful since it really gets hot.</li>
      <li>How is that for an excited lady waiting for her new straightner.</li>
      <li>to have a ¨BaByliss Pro 230 Radiance Straightener¨ (I believe it&#x27;s discontinued) and I was very happy with it; it lasted for almost 5 years until one day the cable failed.</li>
      <li>but I found it challenging with this one as I had to pass the same section of hair over and over.</li>
      <li>Slightly better than my Remington straightener but sort of gives me the same finish(which</li>
      <li>Overall, I have been pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>It actually creates perfect spiral curls all the way to soft waves depending on how long you spend on each section and how high you have your heat setting.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to hold, heats up fast and straightens like no other.  </li>
      <li>Best flat irons ever for hard to straighten hair.</li>
      <li>It becomes hot and ready in seconds and it glides through my hair.</li>
      <li>The product came in a pretty box but with no bag (I like a straight iron bag</li>
      <li>I was worried about the price and because my hair is very curly</li>
      <li>- I read that voltage converters don&#x27;t work very well with appliances that require a lot of power like hair straighteners/curlers/driers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have had this flat iron for a while now. I bought it because it was similar to my HSI that I loved but it got broken. It warms up fast and it easy to hold. My one complaint is that it pulls my hair. I can&#x27;t figure out where exactly (somewhere in the middle) and it only does it fifty percent of the time but that is a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my sister as a gift. She says she is happy with it but I decided to try it myself. The temperature does not seem to go as high as it states. I use a flat iron by &amp;#34;Fahrenheit&amp;#34; which only goes upto 450 and is the temperature I always use. I would have bought the same one but I thought this would be better since it reaches 500. My hair did not easily glide through like it does with my Fahrenheit. Not sure if she is just being polite but I myself was not happy with it. My hair is normally slightly wavy but long and thick, I can easily finish my hair in 15 minutes but I found it challenging with this one as I had to pass the same section of hair over and over.</li>
    <li> Gets very hot. Works well on thick hair. Dual voltage traveled to Europe and worked great!</li>
    <li> Works great!!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this because it is rated for both U.S. and Europe/India voltages with a range of 110V to 240V so, if I&#x27;m understanding correctly, I don&#x27;t have to use a voltage converter - I read that voltage converters don&#x27;t work very well with appliances that require a lot of power like hair straighteners/curlers/driers. So far I&#x27;ve only used it in the U.S. (110V), and it worked well. A benefit I didn&#x27;t anticipate is that the adjustable heat setting allows me to use it at a very low temperature (my hair responds to heat well). Until now, I only straightened my hair on special occasions because I didn&#x27;t like how much it damages my hair, but with the lower heat settings I feel like I can style it more often!</li>
    <li> Very good iron hair... I was worried about the price and because my hair is very curly but it really works, I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Best flat irons ever for hard to straighten hair.</li>
    <li> So far I love it. It cuts the time down in half, straightening my hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron i love this product it got my hair so straight.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product and at such a good price</li>
    <li> Awesome straightener! I&#x27;ve had several high end flat irons and this one is my go to iron. Heats up to 500 degrees and is affordable!</li>
    <li> A good straightener but I think my expectations were too high for my thick curly hair. I don&#x27;t think it is anything exceptional.</li>
    <li> This iron works very well. It heats up quickly and straightens effectively on the first or second go-over. I&#x27;ve had zero issues with it, though I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so. The cord is a good length, not too long so as it catch on things but not to short so as to prevent you from easily maneuvering with it. I bring this when I travel as well and it packs just fine. Does not come with a carrying case but I don&#x27;t think one is necessary anyways. You could always use a sock if you&#x27;re not opposed to a less-than-chic &amp;#34;case&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Bought two... my daughter&#x27;s stole my other.  :)  Works exceptionally well.</li>
    <li> I have owned many straighteners over the years and this one is definitely one of the better ones.  It warms up quickly and the 1.25&amp;#34; plate is the perfect size allowing me to get as close to my roots as possible. I also like the temperature control feature on this straightener and cord length is adequate as well.</li>
    <li> It arrived today with the box  damaged with a cut seal .Also the iron blades has stains like it has been used .It is definitely not a new item maybe refurbished.I took pictures.How is that for an excited lady waiting for her new straightner. The most annoying thing is that there is sticker on the box that says new. I submitted a return.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Professional quality</li>
    <li> My Babyliss Nano Titanium straightener finally died (it kept turning off when I moved it - not a good sign) so I started doing research on a good straightener.  I noticed this Bebella brand had good reviews and the plates were ceramic.  It was also much cheaper than many other ceramic brands with lower ratings so I bought it.  I actually like it a LOT!  It heats up super-quick (60 to 90 seconds) and even on the lowest setting it can straighten my hair with one pass (I have fine hair, but there is a lot of it and it&#x27;s very curly).  The part that you hold stays cool to the touch regardless of the heat setting and the iron can actually sit on the sink &amp;#34;standing up&amp;#34; and not heat up the counter.  There is also a red light on the top that lets you know it&#x27;s on (it&#x27;s a nice reminder if I&#x27;m in a hurry and forget to unplug it) and the temperature setting is inside the &amp;#34;mouth&amp;#34; of the iron, so you don&#x27;t accidentally raise or lower the temperature while you&#x27;re using it.  Another plus is the cord &amp;#34;pivots&amp;#34; from the base when you use it, which is excellent because it keeps it from getting twisted or wrapped around your hand while you&#x27;re using it.  The product came in a pretty box but with no bag (I like a straight iron bag so I can travel with it and this one didn&#x27;t have one - 1/2 star lost), so that was a slight negative.  But the best part of this iron is that my hair looks very shiny and healthy after using it and the style lasts all day (except on extremely humid days the straight style still frizzes some, but that&#x27;s more of me not using the right hair products vs. the straightener, I think - plus humidity and curly hair don&#x27;t mix no matter what you do).  I don&#x27;t know if my old straightener was going &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; for longer than I thought, but I can&#x27;t remember the last time it did as good a job as the Bebella does.  I was very impressed with it.  The one issue I had was my hair does not always slide straight through the plates.  I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;sbecause they&#x27;re floating plates or not, but I had to dock another 1/2 star for this issue.  If I&#x27;m straightening my hair, it&#x27;s never a problem, because I can stop if it gets caught, re-brush out the problem section and finish straightening it.  It occurs when I curl my hair.  It&#x27;s not a huge deal, because it doesn&#x27;t happen with every section of hair, but when I&#x27;m trying to curl my hair with the straightener, I can&#x27;t stop to re-brush out the section - you lose the momentum and end up straightening the section instead.  However, I have never been able to curl my hair with a straightener like I can with this one so it&#x27;s worth the slight aggravation (again - not a constant issue, just an occasional one).  Plus the curly style lasts all day no matter what (humidity or otherwise).  I also read several reviews where customers were disappointed that there were no instructions included in their box. Trust me, there&#x27;s nothing to miss, because mine came with instructions and they were basically safety instructions.  I was looking for them because I wanted to know how the manufacturer recommended using the straightener to make a curly hairstyle (it advertises as a product that can do both - straighten and curl).  However, there were no instructions on how to use the product at all - not to straighten or curl.  But like pretty much everything else, you can just go to youtube and find multiple posts of girls curling their hair with a straightening iron (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;tdy6OQcpklA and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;nVHP49g5IPQ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;A_KxtTVMOxQ are a few) .  They are excellent tutorials and there are multiple ways to do it.  This straightener works with them all - you just have to be patient and find a rhythm, making sure you are letting the hair have enough time as you are pulling it through, to evenly heat the entire section, but not leaving the heat on for a long time at any one point, because then it will straighten (which is whyit&#x27;s such a pain when my hair catches between the plates).  It actually creates perfect spiral curls all the way to soft waves depending on how long you spend on each section and how high you have your heat setting.  And it takes me (with LOTS of slightly-below-shoulder-length hair) less than 15 minutes to style all of my hair in either style (curly or straight).  Honestly, if you had to have only one product between a straightener, a curling iron, curlers or an &amp;#34;Insyler&amp;#34; curling iron, you could just get this straightener, because you can do all of the same styles with this one product as you can with all of those products put together.  I highly recommend this straightener and will be getting at least one more for Christmas gifts this year!</li>
    <li> This is really awesome and gets hot fast, great flat iron and can be used to curl as well love</li>
    <li> I have bought four of them. One for myself and the rest for gifts. Great hair product.</li>
    <li> works better than chi</li>
    <li> Like it, just don&#x27;t like the fact that the buttons to measure aren&#x27;t accurate and they&#x27;re in between the plates.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly,  heats up fast and I&#x27;m about to try it out. Looking forward to having a good product to use.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptic about the price and the value but my doubts were all put to rest as soon as I started to use it. I love this straightener and it does a fantastic job. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It appears to be OK however without trying it out in Europe I don&#x27;t know.  The packaging isn&#x27;t one of a $250.00 product.  As far at the dual voltage it doesn&#x27;t explain anywhere how to switch it from the USA (120) to Europe (220)?</li>
    <li> Perfect for insanely curly hair!</li>
    <li> It works well . I really like the fact that when you hold it, the chance of burning your hand is small. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is the settings of heat are not marked other than 0 and 500 degrees. For example you have to guess where to set the dial if you want 400 degrees. And if the dial moves by mistake by the next time you use it, you have to find the right place again. Other than that, everything works well.  The swivel cord  is convenient . The plates smooth hair well, and the whole item is not too heavy.</li>
    <li> I adore this flat iron. I bought it because I&#x27;m going off to college and I can&#x27;t use the old hot combs on a stove method and I don&#x27;t like electrical ones so I bought this after much research and reviews. I have natural 4a/4b hair and I use mostly twist outs and braid outs, but when I want to straighten my hair I don&#x27;t want to set it 20 steps back with heat damage. But this works wonders. I bought it with the HerStyler Easy Comb to adapt to the chase method and now I&#x27;m not passing through my hair 4 and 5 times causing heat damage, it gets it right with maximum two passes through and it gets my roots/kitchen. The heat goes up to 500 but I don&#x27;t need that setting but it&#x27;s good to have. It makes my hair shine and it&#x27;s like a hard press, because it&#x27;s been a week in the summer and it&#x27;s still straight and healthy looking. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this, and it comes with a warranty. :)</li>
    <li> I have used several different types of flat irons and paid a hundred dollars or more . I LOVE THIS IRON!! I would even go so far as to say It works better than my CHI that I had. I&#x27;m bi-racial and have very coarse,curly hair and this flat iron works awesome for me.</li>
    <li> heats really fast, great for the price!</li>
    <li> I am the type of woman who enjoys her t shirts and jeans over a dress and sandals. Therefore, it&#x27;s rare occasions when I decide to whip out the straightener and tame the mane on my head. The last straightener I had was probably close to 7 years old and I decided it was time to purchase a new one. Because I don&#x27;t do my hair regularly, it made more sense to buy a more cost efficient straightener versus a high end $100+ one. Overall, I have been pleased with the results. It becomes hot and ready in seconds and it glides through my hair. My hair also stays straight throughout the day, something I could not say when I had used old straightener. It gets the job done and at the price it&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
    <li> Loved it any does the job, just got to be careful since it really gets hot.</li>
    <li> Worked much better than I expected but the plate broke when I dropped it from about 2 ft.</li>
    <li> This works better than the one I purchased from Walgreens in the two times I&#x27;ve used this on shoulder length very thick hair. Going to keep using it for a few weeks and if it holds up I&#x27;ll buy another for my gym bag.</li>
    <li> just used it this morning i only had to go over my hair once. i have extra frizzy thick curly hair and need alot of heat. this worked wonders and everyone keeps telling me how awesome it looks and healthy</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price</li>
    <li> Sister in law loves it!</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  Work just as well as my old one that only heated to 450.</li>
    <li> I felt that this curling item caught on my hair.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling as soft and smooth as other irons have or glide very smoothly over my hair, but it does heat up quickly and is easy to hold and use.  It hasn&#x27;t gotten hot enough on the outside to need the included glove, but it definitely gets hot enough to style any type of hair.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> I have natural(frizzy)hair, these are the best flat irons I have ever had..no frizz..especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I currently wear micro bead hair extensions and have curly/frizzy/thick hair (mixed races).  I thought the price was too good to be true but I kid you not this flat iron worked way better than the last one I purchased for over $100!! It straightens and makes a perfect match of my hair with my extensions. Leaves hair very silly and soft...great item!!</li>
    <li> A+ on shipping.  Got this with in two days.  The product itself is awesome.  Love it!  All around, I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful flat iron, does not tug on my hair, nor do i have the horrible breakage problem that my previous model was causing. Iron heats up fast and stays hot when used on my thick, fine stranded hair!</li>
    <li> WORKS VERY WELL.  AS GOOD AS MY FORMER CHI BRAND STRAIGHTNER.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of curly, thick hair very difficult to style,&lt;br /&gt;Used to have a ¨BaByliss Pro 230 Radiance Straightener¨ (I believe it&#x27;s discontinued) and I was very happy with it; it lasted for almost 5 years until one day the cable failed. It had the function of ionic steam, which gave my hair a moisturising finish and eliminated frizz (I really could notice the difference between using the steam function or not).&lt;br /&gt;Now, talking about the &amp;#34;Bebella Premium Pro Professional 1.25&amp;#34; Onyx Plates Hair Straightener Flat&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight and very easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up super fast. I need to go over the same section only 2-3 times to get a perfect straightening. It doesn&#x27;t burn and has never pulled on the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Dual voltage is a plus; I&#x27;ve used it both, USA (110v)  and in Spain (220v).&lt;br /&gt;- Beautiful envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Due to the narrow plates (I always used 2&amp;#34; plates), very thin sections of hair have to be put each time (not a big problem since I need fewer passes to straight my hair, so, in the end, I spend the same time than with my old iron: larger sections of hair but I had to pass it more times).&lt;br /&gt;- The finish is... it let my hair straight and shiny, but with frizzy static!  It&#x27;s something that never happened with my old iron. It seems weird to me that no one has complained about it in the reviews, maybe it only happens to me. I have managed to handle this by using some more amount of anti-frizz cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a very good flat ironing for the price. Certainly it&#x27;s not the greatest, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for $200, but for $25 or so... it definitely does its job.</li>
    <li> LOVE this straightener!  It is easy to hold, heats up fast and straightens like no other.  EXCELLENT value for the price too!  I&#x27;ve used a much more expensive straightener that didn&#x27;t do half as well.</li>
    <li> Works nicely. Arrived very quick</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this flat iron! This has been my 5th flat iron purchase, all consisting of different brands including CHI. This product is absolutely the greatest. If you have smooth, curly hair like me I recommend using a hair product such as CHI silk infusion or BIOSILK silk therapy prior to using this flat iron bc it gets extremely hot (the hotter the better). Also, for best results I recommend using an easy comb which works wonders.</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron for a ridiculously low price - very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Does not straighten my hair like  I thought it would, but does its job. Also good for wet hair. Slightly better than my Remington straightener but sort of gives me the same finish(which i really dont like all that much cos my hair looks dry after straightening) BUT still a good product.</li>
