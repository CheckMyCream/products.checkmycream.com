      <li>I use it with my Clarisonic, so that probably helps deep clean even more, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the FaceDoctorX Complexion Soap.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this facial soap for almost a week and love the results I&#x27;ve been getting.</li>
      <li>I order more when I have 2 bars left in my supply (each bar lasts about 3 week/1 month)    </li>

      <li>It is great for my Rosacea keep the red and the sensitivity down..</li>

      <li>cuz it is very drying</li>
      <li>I was hesistant to spend money on a product that was a bit pricier than others, but it&#x27;s really working for me.</li>
      <li>and it is again working very well.  </li>

<li> Also, if Seabuckthorn oil is suppose to be the main active ingredient in combating Rosacea, its the second last ingredient listed next to fragrance - I have no clue what % is in it or the % of the other</li>
<li> and it is lasting a long time.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t last as long as the face dr rx used to it</li>
<li> I tried FaceDoctorX Complexion Soap a long time ago, and have never looked back!  </li>
<li> I keep the bar dry between uses and that helps to make it last longer-</li>
<li> i have used it every single night since i got it (with the exception of like 2 nights) and the redness has not come back either, which is something i was worried about.</li>
<li> Should I have a small breakout, I simply leave the lather on the spot for a couple of minutes and the area is clear again in no time.  </li>
<li> It seems expensive for a bar of soap but cheap in comparison to Metrogel which did nothing</li>
<li> I have gone through nearly a bar using the soap as directed everyday.  </li>
<li> The smell takes some getting used to but overall its a decent product and worth a try if you&#x27;re struggling to find a solution for bad skin</li>
<li> We have chucked all the other cremes, lotions, toners.. for one simple bar soap that goes through airport security with no hassles and won&#x27;t leak like liquids.</li>
<li> I will be a life long user!</li>
<li> My skin is a bit oily, so if you have dry skin, put a moisturizing cream on after you wash with this soap.     </li>
<li> whatever the reason - it seems to work for me and helps keep my jawline clear of small pimple like bumps that were a problem before I found and used this product.    </li>
<li> One bar lasts me on average five months using twice daily.  </li>
<li> Not the same packaging as advertised, so not sure if its the same product.  </li>
<li> Also, always rinse face with warm water after humidity or sweating, then rinse with very cold water.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s variations, and it left my skin very dry or too oily (depending on which kind I used), but it just left a nasty metallic taste in my mouth.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this for years and still love it ... it works great and skin feels so clean afterwards ... I bought it for problem skin and it has helped ALOT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this soap successfully in the past to relieve rosecea symptoms.  I could really tell the difference.  So when my daughter in law began having complexion problems I recommended it to her.  She had used many other products without success.  Within a few days she said that the FaceDoctor Complexion Soap started showing great results.  She is very happy with the FaceDoctor Complexion Soap.</li>
    <li> I have been using FaceDoctor RX for 4 years now... I love it. It is great for my Rosacea keep the red and the sensitivity down..</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with acne and I bought this product because I heard that it contained seabuckthorn oil.  This product does an \\&quot;okay\\&quot; job making sure my acne doesn&#x27;t go completely out of control, but I&#x27;ve had much more success with 10% benzoyl peroxide washes in the past.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial soap for almost a week and love the results I&#x27;ve been getting. I noticed a difference in my skin after the first day. The breakout I had on my chin shrunk and my whole complexion is smoother and clearer. I was hesistant to spend money on a product that was a bit pricier than others, but it&#x27;s really working for me.</li>
    <li> exactly what was ordered and expected</li>
    <li> my mom recommended this to me for my oily/breakout prone skin... it really dries out my skin a lot, so I can&#x27;t use it in the fall/winter. But for summer its great. The smell takes some getting used to but overall its a decent product and worth a try if you&#x27;re struggling to find a solution for bad skin</li>
    <li> This soap has helped to clear up my complexion, smooth out my skin and I think has even helped even out my skin tone.  I use it with my Clarisonic, so that probably helps deep clean even more, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the FaceDoctorX Complexion Soap.  Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes accidentally, it burns like crazy!</li>
    <li> This soap does all it says!  I used it for rosacea, cleared it up in a couple of days. Its gentle and it leaves your face feeling squeaky clean!</li>
    <li> I tried many other remedies ,both prescribed and over the counter,and  Face Doctor was the only one that clleared my acne .I can&#x27;t extoll it high enough.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap twice a day for four months. I also now use a 50 SPF sunscreen as a moisturizer/make-up base in the morning.     If you have rosacea, do not leave the house in the morning without sunscreen. (Also, a good idea if you do not want skin cancer.)    I was using LaMer moisterizer, but it&#x27;s very expensive (like $150 a jar) and loved the cream, but he liquid made my rosacea worse.  Honestly, I have tried lots of very mild soaps and nothing helped.     Another nurse at work recommended this product. When I read the whole thing I laughed out load at the skin mite stuff.  Whatever.  But her skin was so much better, I gave it a try.  The rest is history.     I wash my face in the shower in the morning. I also do not spray water directly on my face and turn the temperature down to about 85 degrees at most.  Put the soap on with my hands, not a scratchy cloth, and leave on for 30 seconds while I finish my shower. (The tricky part is not opening your eyes this whole time.)    I then put on 50 spf Banana Boat sunscreen. Then I still do use the LeMer make up.      I have found that using the soap twice a day is a bit drying, so I also might opt for using the Olay make-up wipes at night, since they also remove mascara.  I also like the wipes you get at Target called something like Product 7.  My skin is a bit oily, so if you have dry skin, put a moisturizing cream on after you wash with this soap.     Anyway, my rosacea is about 80-90% gone.  I have read reviews on this product that people think it burns or works for a few weeks and then stops, but my skin has really improved. It does have kind of a weird smell. But now my face has no little red bumps at all. Still red tones  in some areas, but totally smooth so make up coverage isn&#x27;t lumpy.   I am Scottish/Irish descent, and have been told Northern Europeans get rosacea more frequently. I had the \\&quot;butterfly\\&quot; rosacea on the sides of my nose and on my chin and a little on the center of my forehead.     I went to my dermatologist yesterday and she was stunned at how much better my skin looks and she even showed me a photo she had taken of me when she originally diagnosed my rosacea a year ago. A HUGE improvement. She had recommended several of the \\&quot;dermatologist tested\\&quot; milk soaps and creams for me then, but none have worked as well as this soap.     Skin mites causing rosacea? Heck. I don&#x27;t care if chocolate covered kangaroos cause it, I just wanted it GONE, and this soap has really helped!</li>
    <li> Use this soap twice a day, and your face will clear up!  Use warm water, not hot, and pat dry.  I skipped moisturizer.  Also, always rinse face with warm water after humidity or sweating, then rinse with very cold water.  You will get results.</li>
    <li> My 17 year old son had severe acne and was on medication for it. After using this soap there was a dramatic and obvious change and reduction of his acne in just two uses</li>
    <li> I bought this \\&quot;soap\\&quot; for its anti-aging and pore reduction properties; I have seen results and my skin feels better than ever, no drying no tightness, no slippery residue. My teens tried it and now they won&#x27;t use anything else including that expensive System endorsed by celebrities. We have chucked all the other cremes, lotions, toners.. for one simple bar soap that goes through airport security with no hassles and won&#x27;t leak like liquids. It worked so well for my daughter that someone stole her bar at camp.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for about 6 years it worked wonders on my Rosacea, that I have been fighting for 30 years.</li>
    <li> I have had rosacea with a great deal of redness for several years.  I purchased this product thinking it might help reduce my facial ruddiness. I have gone through nearly a bar using the soap as directed everyday.  I tried to use it twice a day but it dried my face too much and made it itchier so I went to once a day, before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pores seemed to shrink somewhat but the redness was not reduced at all. I am very disappointed with this product.  It did not deliver what it promised.</li>
    <li> I use this facial soap once per day and it works well, but has a pretty strong fragrance when you first open the box.  Good price, and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I had used the face doctor soap product for a few years.  I use it to reduce redness (rosacea maybe) and occasional acne.  I still get acne and I&#x27;m more than a tad over 40!  My understanding is that one of the main ingredients is sea buckthorn oil.  I thought if that&#x27;s the case, more should be better, so I bought a buckthorn oil soap from someone else.    Well, the pure oil soap clogged by pores and I got more problems than using nothing.  I&#x27;ve switched back to face doctor and it is again working very well.  Won&#x27;t be trying anything else anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I am 42 years of age and have had Rosacea since my teens (yes, really).  I&#x27;ve tried the Metro-gel in all it&#x27;s variations, and it left my skin very dry or too oily (depending on which kind I used), but it just left a nasty metallic taste in my mouth.  It was also expensive!  I tried FaceDoctorX Complexion Soap a long time ago, and have never looked back!  This stuff works!  You would never know I have (or should I say, HAD) Rosacea! One bar lasts me on average five months using twice daily.  I will be a life long user!</li>
    <li> I have used this product and think it is wonderful for clearing acne.  I recommend it to anyone that wants clear skin.</li>
    <li> I am a 45 year old mother of three who has suffered with painful embarrasing cystic acne for over twenty five years.  I started using this product over a year ago. It was reccomended to me by a friend whose daughter is an acne sufferer. After using the complexion bar for about a month, I noticed my skin begin to change. My usual breakouts were disappearing and my face felt softer to the touch.  A year later I am acne free and continue to use the complexion bar. Should I have a small breakout, I simply leave the lather on the spot for a couple of minutes and the area is clear again in no time.  I can&#x27;t thank the friend who recommended this bar to me enough!</li>
    <li> it worked very well. many of these other reviews have had it work within a couple weeks, mine took a few months to start to lessen the redness on my face and i am very happy with it. i have tried countless creams and prescriptions and pills recommended by a dermatologist and nothing has worked. this is the first successful product and i have recommended it to a friend with the same &amp;#34;rosacea type&amp;#34; skin problem on her face as well. i washed my face with it every night (leave the suds on for a good 30 seconds to a minute) since i got it followed by sunscreen (a baby sunscreen for sensitive skin) and a good lotion (aveeno overnight intense moisture) cuz it is very drying and i went to bed with it like that. when u first use it and wash your face, if u leave it on for too long it starts to burn a little but just b sure u thoroughly rince it off. i wouldnt recommend it twice a day because of how drying it is. i have used it every single night since i got it (with the exception of like 2 nights) and the redness has not come back either, which is something i was worried about. i highly recommend it to anyone suffering from a lot of redness or rosacea/rosacea-like symptoms. i hope this helped and good luck (:</li>
    <li> Excellent product for rosacea, it’s the only product that controls my condition.&lt;br /&gt;Haven’t had a flare up in about ten years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 53 year old male and like to shower with this soap. It makes me feel very clean and balanced. If you suffer from any kind of \\&quot;ichiness\\&quot;, this may solve your problem. Have tried higher priced store brands, but like this the best. Doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of soap film feel. The only problem is the price. I wish they had 4 or 5 bar packs at a better discount.</li>
    <li> We were completely satisfied with it.  We have used it for sometime and it has always worked VERY well for us.  We cannot find it locally, so we are happy to be able to order it!!</li>
    <li> In my fifties and diagnosed with rosacea - my forehead was completely broken out and spreading to my cheeks. My skin was so red, itchy and irritated I was at my wits end. This soap was not an overnight cure but I have used it daily and in 2 weeks my skin was 50% better and in one month it is 95% better. Definitely recommend this soap and not as drying for me as some have said although I do use Eucerin face cream. It seems expensive for a bar of soap but cheap in comparison to Metrogel which did nothing and it is lasting a long time. I lather up my face for 30 seconds morning and night, rinse thoroughly and then either use sunscreen or night cream. Hope this helps other rosacea sufferers.</li>
    <li> Tiny almost invisible bumps along my jawline are gone when I use this soap each day - I do find it pricey for a bar of soap - but compared to the many other facial cleansing items I have tried for this problem - this soap works and so is worth the money.    I keep the bar dry between uses and that helps to make it last longer- it lathers well even when the bar is almost gone. I re-order this in multiples so that I have a supply in case there is a problem re-ordering it.   ** I order more when I have 2 bars left in my supply (each bar lasts about 3 week/1 month)    it is supposed to help with microscopic facial mites  / not sure I have a problem with these (everyone has them and there is no way to rid yourself of them - but maybe the soap helps keep their numbers in check )    whatever the reason - it seems to work for me and helps keep my jawline clear of small pimple like bumps that were a problem before I found and used this product.    the soap has a slight clean medicinal fragrance that dissipates quickly when you rinse your face.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and the product is exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> Very Drying and terrible cheap soap smell.</li>
    <li> Not the same packaging as advertised, so not sure if its the same product.  Also, if Seabuckthorn oil is suppose to be the main active ingredient in combating Rosacea, its the second last ingredient listed next to fragrance - I have no clue what % is in it or the % of the other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has not had any impact on my Rosacea, I have used it for about 3-4weeks day and night.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. Saw a huge difference within 3 days of use.  Immediately bought two more bars!</li>
    <li> I order this over and over. It is my favorite face soap and helps me feel squeaky clean. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. I usually order two at a time. They don&#x27;t last as long as the face dr rx used to it seems but i like the product.</li>
    <li> works for rosacea control</li>
</ol>
