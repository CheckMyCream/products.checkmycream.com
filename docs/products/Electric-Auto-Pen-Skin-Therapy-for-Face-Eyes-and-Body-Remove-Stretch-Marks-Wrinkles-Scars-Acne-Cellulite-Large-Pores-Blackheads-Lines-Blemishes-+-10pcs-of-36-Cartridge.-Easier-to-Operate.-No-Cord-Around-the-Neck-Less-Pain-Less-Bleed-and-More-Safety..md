      <li>After, 3rd day I will say my skin looks great!!</li>
      <li>The Spas &amp; Doctor offices would cost a fortune because regardless of source, the device will have to be used many times to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I heard about this dermapen from a friend and was very interested in trying after seeing many of her problems area disappear.</li>
      <li>It comes with charger and free derma pen re-fill</li>
      <li>Then I was fortunate to have a friend with an microobrasion machine.</li>
      <li>, however I felt the instruction pamphlet lacked important information.</li>
      <li>I love my derma pen, my skin looks fresh but it need time to see the result.</li>
      <li>Whether you use this device OR go to a Doctor, there will be some pain involve because the skin HAS to be lightly damaged to increase the collagen.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>

      <li>First off, for an item that punctures your skin</li>
      <li>I also did my first session on my had today</li>
      <li>When I gave it a good look while trying to figure out what the problem was I noticed the needles were bent just from the few minutes that I used it.  </li>
      <li>and it feels pretty much like the gel used at the spa.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve battled with mild to severe acne since I was 12 years old.</li>

      <li>but honestly it really doesn&#x27;t. ,</li>
      <li>This is the real Dermapen.</li>
      <li>A lower number of needles makes it much easier for the needle to enter and exit the skin with out trauma.</li>
      <li>I was ready to use it on my hand.</li>
      <li>The glycerin was bought at Whole Foods (but can probably be bought at Amazon as well) and is used as a preservative.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Will this remove stretch marks as bad as this!?!? Remove as back to youre old non stretch mark skin?</li>
    <li> I am so glad I have this Derma Stamp Pen! I had a scare on the side of my face, from when I was younger, and now it is gone!  I have also been using on my winkles with great results!  I am 50 years old and now I look about 35!  I did not ever want to use any chemicals on my body and now I use my Derma Pen with success! If you have any marks, wrinkles, or any part of your body that needs some TLC, Then this is for you!  It also makes my skin so soft after each use.  I highly recommend Derma Stamp Pen for everyone to use!  What are you waiting for, buy it, you won&#x27;t ever regret it!</li>
    <li> I was worried worried about using a product like this and not receiving the same results as the doctor. The product was easy to use and lived the fact it came with the extra needles. The only one recommend is buying some numbing cream .</li>
    <li> Needles don&#x27;t pierce the skin as indicated. Am going to return.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent micro needyle derma stamp pen, I am sooo lucky to have this item during its launching promotion. When I used this derma pen, it didn&#x27;t hurt at all, unlike a normal derma roller. I am addicted to using it, I use it to reduce my fine lines and scars on my forehead. This is a convenient device, lightweight and portable.</li>
    <li> Ok.. This device is supposed to be a stamp pen?. There&#x27;s no stamping feature whatsoever!??. How can this product be effective? I would like to know how other users who have purchased are operating this thing?? Do not buy this product. No good detailed instructions on how to use it just instructions for the set up. Very very disappointing</li>
    <li> This scarred my skin for about a month. I would just stick to regular needle rollers.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:5d079178212c9b3e5833bd4352f70b25]] I got this DermaPen not to long ago...was scared but excited to try, but after first try I was hooked! It&#x27;s a needle treatment for almost anything: scars, wrinkles, stretch marks and even thinning hair. Just don&#x27;t be scared, it does not hurt: slight tingling but no pain.,It will  make your skin a little red especially the first couple times, your skin got to get use to it, but no fear the redness goes away in about1 -2 hours, so I definitely recommend to do the treatments at night. But there is no bleeding - it was my greatest fear. I have a lot of acne scars, so I love this product for acne scar treatment. But you can do so much with it. You can adjust 5 speeds and the length of needles. It come with a charger and once you charge it it will work for at least 2 - 3 hours. You will definitely feel tingling after the treatment but it goes away in about an hour and as I said no redness.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and deliver the promise! Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Very Satisfied.  Just need to know where to order the needles when my supply ruins out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually post reviews but this product really works and I would like everyone to know this. I was researching about different types of derma pens and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this one. I watched on YouTube several tutorials on how to use prep your skin and use it (highly recommend doing that), my skin was red immediately after that and felt really tight, but in 2 days when all the redness disappeared completely, my skin was glowing, even, pores were much smaller, almost none and for the first time in a long time I didn&#x27;t have to apply foundation, just a moisturizer with high spf!!! I found reviews very helpful in determining which one to buy or if I should do it myself or go to the specialist (btw in Florida one session of derma pen micro needle treatment is around $500!) So, I hope you would find my review helpful as well:)</li>
    <li> I love it ... Me encanta</li>
    <li> The Q&amp;A section says this moves up and down. It doesn&#x27;t, from what I can tell. The needle length can be adjusted up and down, at set up, from 0 to 2mm. But once you pick your length and start the machine, it just vibrates. Not what micro needling is supposed to do. If you watch videos of simulations of micro needling, the point is to move up and down to puncture your skin multiple times. Not to vibrate.</li>
    <li> Once you turn it on it won turn off. You have to let the battery die out.</li>
    <li> Knock off peice of crap! Will shred your skin. Dont buy.</li>
    <li> this derma pen is so easy to use. The small size making it easy to store away for later use! im excited to start seeing result on my problem area  especially my stretch mark.  I was sceptical at first thinking oh my... this gonna hurt.  but honestly it really doesn&#x27;t. , and it&#x27;s cordless. The item is very well made, and high quality, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it so far.</li>
    <li> Great!!! This is the real Dermapen. Get one. Change your face. Change you life.</li>
    <li> This product works at small depth from .25 mm 2.5 mm. Otherwise there is a lot of skin tearing and the needles seem to get stuck in the skin. I am a trained aesthetician and know how to use this product. It is made very cheaply however it can provide beneficial results at lower needle depths (.25-.5mm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally please keep in mind that you must use some sort of lubrication such as hyaluronic acid with this product. Lastly I would recommend using the 12 needle stamp tip rather than the 36. A lower number of needles makes it much easier for the needle to enter and exit the skin with out trauma. This just has to do with physics and the amount of force per needle.</li>
    <li> I have had micro-needling twice at a reputable spa and was noticing pretty good results. At $225 a pop I decided to go on my own and try it. After doing much research I decided on this particular dermapen.  I made up my own hyaluronic acid (see link) to use during the procedure  and then applied another thick coat afterwards.  I used it yesterday and this morning I am slightly pink. My skin reacted the same with this dermapen as with the $225 procedure. http://www.mixedmakeup.com/hyaluronic-acid-serum-to-make-at-home-easy-anti-aging-diy/  I posted this link mainly to show a picture of the hyaluronic I chose. Also bought through Amazon. The glycerin was bought at Whole Foods (but can probably be bought at Amazon as well) and is used as a preservative. I eliminated the green tea and lavender and doubled the strength of the hyaluronic powder to get the content more at 2%  and it feels pretty much like the gel used at the spa. DO NOT buy the $15 bottles of this on the net.  It is not pure - it would cost you around $200 for a tiny bottle to get what you need for this procedure so make it yourself at a fraction of the cost.  I think that I&#x27;m going to be happy with this dermapen.</li>
    <li> The device may work better with needle cartridges with a lower needle count, I don&#x27;t know. However the device comes with 36 count needle cartridges and does not penetrate the skin, it only vibrates and scratches your skin severly. All of the positive reviews must be planted which is sad.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:c2dea070959c2911a9ff18a4e2e9385]]Ok... I must admit that at first I was deathly scared of this because it&#x27;s a needle, but then I just had to think of it that it&#x27;s super small and will do wonders for many different beauty needs lol!  I got over the fear extremely quick..especially since when I saw the needle piece itself.. it&#x27;s extremely tiny.  I have attached a video of my unboxing of this product for everyone to see what comes with it.  I also did my first session on my had today and there was no pain so that was a BIG PLUS!  I have a really big scar on my hand due to being a disgruntled teen, and have regretted it ever since.  I am looking forward to seeing how this skin therapy pen can help me with that and ALSO for my stretch marks that I received while pregnant with my son.  So far I am giving his 5 stars and am very impressed with everything from packaging to quality.  If you&#x27;re looking to do some skin therapy on yourself... this is the one to get!  Note: I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:d148b3561f4cda12119bed68f48a1271]]I received this product at a discount for my honest review and feedback. It was very easy to use and put together. It did not come with a lot of instructions on how to use the product which was a negative but after researching myself I was ready to use it on my hand. Please watch my video for further info about the product and how to use it. I am definitely excited to use it more and see if I can see any results on my face.</li>
    <li> I love my derma pen, my skin looks fresh but it need time to see the result. I am ok to wait because everything that really work to improve your skin needs time to see the results. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product is great because it treated right on the spot problem area.  It comes with charger and free derma pen re-fill so I am grateful for that. it is wireless so you can easily apply anywhere without strangling yourself. Micro needle doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin and not bleed.  almost forget to mention that this derma pen have a setting.</li>
    <li> just a piece of junk...no stamping does not go up and down ..will hurt you skin badly....Canadian women</li>
    <li> I have tried many products to help me with my wrinkles, acne scars, blackheads and cellulite. Nothing seem to truly help my issues go away. I heard about this dermapen from a friend and was very interested in trying after seeing many of her problems area disappear. I got this electric pen and I have to say I am very happy I did. I am noticing such a big change in my problem areas. I am so glad I got this electrical one to help go along my delicate areas without harming me. The pen works smoothly and works the area that needs to be worked on perfectly. With this pen I am also able to treat areas that are sensitive and small areas. I highly recommend this to anyone really wanting to treat their problem areas without all the harsh chemicals. I would also recommend to follow the directions word by word to ensure you are using the pen correctly. I am so happy to lose the cellulite and my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed an item on Amazon before but after wasting my time on this product I feel compelled to.  I should have known when I opened the scratched plastic box and looked at the &amp;#34;directions&amp;#34; what I was in for, but I decided to give it a try.  First off, for an item that punctures your skin I would think that there would be some sort of instructions on how to best use this product on different areas or your body and how to prep your skin before use.  There are none.  The only instructions included tell you how to switch speeds on the product and how to insert the needle into the pen.  After a several minutes googling I pieced together the best way to treat my problem area and was excited to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;  I had multiple problems.  The needles barely pierced my skin, the speed settings kept slipping from one to the next, if only a minor amount of pressure was applied the tip would stop functioning, and the battery ran out after a few minutes of use and an overnight charge.  I then plugged the unit in thinking maybe the battery was faulty.  I still had all of the same problems while using it connected to the power supply.  When I gave it a good look while trying to figure out what the problem was I noticed the needles were bent just from the few minutes that I used it.  It was at this point I decided to return the product.  My skin isn&#x27;t worth permanently damaging.&lt;br /&gt;  In short, don&#x27;t waste your time on this product. I have already applied for a return and am waiting on UPS to pick it up as I type this.</li>
    <li> I have only used the device twice thus far but it appears to be basically the same device used in the videos advertising Spas and Doctor offices. The Spas &amp; Doctor offices would cost a fortune because regardless of source, the device will have to be used many times to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside: it is a bit painful OR I am a big baby...but I have wrinkles around my eyes and on my hands/wrists due to prior sun damage.  I have to do something proactive to increase collagen. Whether you use this device OR go to a Doctor, there will be some pain involve because the skin HAS to be lightly damaged to increase the collagen. (If you can drink alcohol, this would be a good time for a glass of win .just to dull the pain....but you MUST be alert to use the device properly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other downside is that the directions were written by someone who speaks English as a 2nd language.  However, rather than taking advice from a Customer like me...please watch the UTube videos provided by Doctors.  You will know exactly how to use it professionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I tried the manual needle roller about 2 years ago...and it is much less effective because it is difficult to determine how deep to go.  This device makes it easy to needle to the correct depth.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a good C Serum cream to use to make the device &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; over your skin...I use the term &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; but remember the needles MUST penetrate to be effective.  (I used the device on my leg 1st since it is winter and if I had hurt myself, no one would see my leg until after the skin healed. I did not hurt myself...but I did gain confidence!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the same C Serum afterwards...and let your skin heal overnight. I bought my C Serum on Amazon.  (These steps/advice were all explained on UTube by Doctors.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands looked awful for 2-3 days...but my face was only slightly red and was easily covered by make-up the next day.  Again, I expected this after watching UTube videos.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other point I would make is that some people on UTube say that the needles can be used a 2nd or 3rd time if cleaned properly. I disagree...I think reusing dulled needles is asking for trouble. Amazon sells additional needles for the device and I also bought them when I bought the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this device and the concept a 10! I wish I had been aware of it many years ago.  If you have 2-3 days where no one will question what happened to your hands (LOL), buy this plus additional needles and a C Serum.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other point I would make is that some people on UTube say that the needles can be used a 2nd or 3rd time if cleaned properly.

    <li> I wish I was told that the needle doesnt move up and down by itself. However, I manually move it around it does work just fine. I use it once every 2 weeks and toss the needle cartridge after use. The frequency of my use probably effects my results. But I have started to use this with Retin A to see if I can get quicker results.</li>
    <li> this product does not go up-and-down it only vibrates the needles stay in one spot and vibrate which is not what it should do</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve battled with mild to severe acne since I was 12 years old. Now 18 years later I still won&#x27;t leave the house without full coverage makeup to hide the imperfections and scaring the acne left behind. So you can imagine how incredibly excited I was to get the opportunity to test this product at a substantial discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. When it arrived I couldn&#x27;t wait to test it out. The pen was packaged very nicely in a plastic storage case. It came with a wall charger, instruction pamphlet and 10 individually packaged sterile needles. I went for the instruction pamphlet first, however I felt the instruction pamphlet lacked important information. It basically advised how to insert the needle, how to adjust the depth of the needle, how to power the pen on, and how to adjust the speed. However being as this was the first time I had ever used a device that was designed to poke holes into my skin I needed better instruction on exactly what I was supposed to do, so I decided to check out some videos on the Internet. After watching several videos on dermapens, I was finally comfortable enough to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I removed the pen from the plastic storage case and a sterile needle from its packaging and put the needle on the pen. It locked in place nicely with no problems. I adjusted the needle depth to the lowest it would go and then turned the pen on to the lowest speed. I started with a small spot on my hand, once I was comfortable with the pain level and how it was going to feel I decided to move to my face. I cleaned my face with my normal face wash and then followed with some hyaluronic acid serum. Once my face was prepped I turned on the pen and went to town. The needles don&#x27;t really hurt, it&#x27;s more of an annoyance then a pain, at least it was for me. When I had completed my whole face it was pretty red. I didn&#x27;t notice a lot of bleeding but I also only had the needle depth at a 0.5 to a 1.0 and I was on the 2nd speed. I washed my face again and followed up with the hyaluronic serum again. My face felt slightly irritated like I had expected, but not bothersome. It was late so I just went to bed, when I woke up the redness was practically gone. I look forward to seeing results after a couple days/weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had such great success with my face, I decided I would try the pen on a scar I have on my wrist/arm area. The pen says it works on stretch marks and scars so why not see if it can help soften my scar. So I cleaned my wrist/arm area, turned the pen on and went to town. I decided to only treat about 1/3 of my scar and take a photo. I have added the photo to this review. The spot I treated is red and had some slight bleeding, as you can see in the attached picture. I look forward to giving this some time to heal and see if it made any difference. I will update a photo as well as my review once it heals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with how this pen works. After watching some videos of how it&#x27;s done in a doctors office and seeing the redness of those customers in the video and comparing their after treatment look to my after treatment look, I&#x27;m confident this product works just as well as the treatment you would get at a doctors office. I love how I can use this pen in the privacy of my own home, and I&#x27;m not paying a fortune for treatments. I am very pleased with the NuCell Skin Solutions Dermapen and I will update my review after a couple weeks to show if the pen helped reduce the appearance of my acne scaring and the scar on my wrist.y face again and followed up with the hyaluronic serum again.

    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve completed one treatment on both my mom and I.  We used a topical numbing product to lessen any potential pain from the needles.  Minor redness and bleeding which is to be expected.  The product worked great. You can see the needles going up and down.  I will follow up after a few more uses, possibly with before and after photos.</li>
    <li> Ok hear it is the truth! Bought this product to get rid of a scar caused by cystic acne. Bought numbing cream and also hylorconic acid to apply after. The setting I started on for it was at at 1.5 wow it hurt! Then, I got braver n cranked it up to highest setting n power. The scar bled. But I was determined to change the scar, held it on it for 10 min. I used this all over my face in a basket weave design as I did it. But at a lower setting. The next day, my acne scar was RUFF FEELING then I applied Neosporin to the site. Next day it began to peel and change! My face did aswell. Then I was fortunate to have a friend with an microobrasion machine. Used it to remove dead skin that was being formed on top of my face. After, 3rd day I will say my skin looks great!! Scar that I applied extra needling to is still shedding the skin!! :) it&#x27;s changing the look of it after 3 days!!! I&#x27;m very pleased n this product and recommend it to anyone! ;)</li>
    <li> I have used the Dermapen twice and I stared to see the results.</li>
