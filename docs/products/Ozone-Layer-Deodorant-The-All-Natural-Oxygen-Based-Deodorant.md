### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works wonderfully!  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the best smell,  my husband calls it &amp;#34;hippy smell&amp;#34</li>
      <li>While I wish it had a sweeter smell, it is the best working and smelling….and</li>
      <li>Works great!  </li>
      <li>The bees wax scent is pleasant too!</li>
      <li>I saw this and saw that it had great reviews.  </li>
      <li>The concept is great, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the executed product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for blocking sweat and odor.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind an overpowering beeswax scent, then this is a great deodorant for fighting underarm odor.</li>
      <li>If you love cilantro, that&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t good for me.</li>
      <li>It works all day, and smells so good.</li>
      <li>Good product and will be purchasing again.  </li>
      <li>The good:  </li>
      <li>The best and most important part of the product is its ability to mask the odor of sweat.  </li>
      <li>Pretty awesome!</li>
      <li>Works nicely</li>
      <li>It got 3 stars cause it smells nice.</li>
      <li>this deodorant does a nice job fighting odor.</li>
      <li>No irritation of any kind.</li>
      <li>However, that may be from the very strong beeswax smell.</li>
      <li>This is so far the best scent.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this, it seems like a brilliant idea.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like them to smell better but it works</li>
      <li>I figure I will give it a couple more days</li>
      <li>maybe they are better than this one</li>
      <li>It has almost a citronella scent to it, but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>It is still better than using a product with aluminum in it.  </li>
      <li>And then as my day went on I didn&#x27;t smell any better.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.  </li>
      <li>Priorities people :)</li>
      <li>After months of use, I think it&#x27;s doing a better job</li>
      <li>It seems to work OK</li>
      <li>I had originally tried to make my own deodorant at home using baking soda but the baking soda</li>
      <li>Crystal essence is pretty good but again need to reapply during day i guess since it is summer it doesnt help.</li>
      <li>and so far its all good, no rash and nicely moisturized skin is all I have to report.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
      <li>One is generally easy to manage, one you better come strong or else.</li>
      <li>With the other brand I was really impressed with how well it worked, however my skin was not a fan</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes and it&#x27;s easy to apply...</li>
      <li>The ozone smell is really strong</li>
      <li>I still have odor issues using it, and it adds a strong scent to my B.O., which I assume is the oxygen.</li>
      <li>We have tried myriad natural deodorants and this is the best so far!!</li>
      <li>For me it works fine for day to day use</li>
      <li>scent is nice and pleasant, not very strong and definitely better than the unscented ozone layer deodorant.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best natural deodorant i&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>but the ozone layer deodorant actually seemed to sooth the rash which was a welcome relief.  </li>
      <li>However, I may try to see what other brands have good reviews since most of these natural deodorants arent so great.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find that the coconut scented version was much more appealing, and the scent hid the sharp ozone odor of the straight deodorant.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased it at a Farmers Market in Carolina Beach NC.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy that I found a natural deodorant with no junk in it, that ACTUALLY works!</li>
      <li>But understand that this deodorant never actually had a pleasant smell either in the tube or on my pits.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad smell, it&#x27;s just a smell</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually review, but this is amazing!!</li>
      <li>If you use the right amount, it has a light almost pineapple-y smell that fades gradually throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It is mild and sweet.</li>
      <li>I have to say that as much as I like to ozinate the air at my house, the smell of the deodorant is too strong - and I didn&#x27;t feel like I started my day clean and smelling</li>
      <li>Love that it is only a couple familiar ingredients, but it didn&#x27;t do it for me - bummer!</li>
      <li>Smells great,  works well when it&#x27;s not hot!</li>
      <li>It also has a bit of a strong syrupy smell if you use too much.</li>
      <li>My daughter &amp; I really wanted to like this product but the strong beeswax smell made both of us nauseous.</li>
      <li>However, the only conundrum I had was the strong and potent smell.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve not tested it during any kind of physical activity.  </li>
      <li>The Arm &amp; Hammer natural deodorant works better.</li>
      <li>most natural deodorant I have found so</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now, and, so far, I am extremely pleased.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes it smells good to me, but other times it makes me nauseous...?</li>
      <li>but it kinda has a hint of b.o. in the tube or right after you put it on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants &amp; this is definitely one of the better ones.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soooo strong that my 4 year old noticed when I picked her up, asking why do I smell</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to wash your pits first.  </li>
      <li>didnt last as long as i thought it would for all the great reviews</li>
      <li>so funny?</li>
      <li>It is exactly like rubbing a handful of those soapy leaves on your underarms.</li>
      <li>First, let me say ...</li>
      <li>The first day i didn&#x27;t need to reapply the coconut at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to always remember to apply a much thicker coat with natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>I measured it&#x27;s effectiveness by the fact that I smelled no different hours later because, again, it doesn&#x27;t smell good anyway.</li>
      <li>I have found traditional deodorants that can handle my strong armpit, but this one is not up to the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After trying the ozone w/ coconut scent for a few days I am less than impressed with it.  </li>
      <li>I like the very limited ingredients are healthy on my skin.</li>
      <li>The one that I picked up is supposed to be coconut scented but to me really doesn&#x27;t smell anything like coconuts.</li>
      <li>And you can really reapply it if you do start to stink and it gets rid of the odor.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use it bc of that.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping though,</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m really picky about deodorant</li>
      <li>It is gentle on my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can really smell the ozone which I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
      <li>Regardless, it&#x27;s safe for your body, no disgusting chemicals and works just as well as Secret did.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a ton of different all natural deodorants and none of them have ever been able to keep me from stinking by the end of my workday.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really care for this, it has a very strong odd smell to it.</li>
      <li>I feel like it makes me more smelly then helping the other way around</li>
      <li>This deodorant offers pretty good protection I would say at least 12+ hrs.  </li>
      <li>The smell is not the creamy coconut you would get with other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; deodorants, and at first I was worried as it has a peculiar smell that is fairly strong.</li>
      <li>This natural deodorant really works!</li>
      <li>I experienced absolutely no irritation or trouble applying, but I also didn&#x27;t experience body odor relief.</li>
      <li>the odor protection front, this deodorant lasts about 6-8 hours (4-6 hours depending on the weather and activity) before I need to reapply, which is fine since you can reapply without having to shower but the container of deodorant is bulky and not very portable.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants and this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>When you do it should last you through pretty much anything.</li>
      <li>but I could live with that.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered the one with coconut and couldn&#x27;t stop gagging at the scent. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed as this was not cheap.</li>
    <li> Smells awful!!!!!!  Ack!!  I am returning!</li>
    <li> Works really well. I like the scent too. I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants &amp; this is definitely one of the better ones. It&#x27;s important to always remember to apply a much thicker coat with natural deodorant. When you do it should last you through pretty much anything.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually review, but this is amazing!! I have been very sick the last few days and skipped a shower yesterday.  Woke up today with no odor! Normally with a regular deodorant/antiperspirant (containing aluminum) I am a little not so fresh when I wake up with daily showers. Forget the other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried,most didn&#x27;t last my work day. green tidings was my former fave and it usually lasted between showers but I would never dream of skipping a day. I am blown away by this ozone layer! Not even a wiff of funkiness, even with my sickie night sweating! The one thing not totally positive is that I ordered coconut scent and it in no way smells like any coconut scent I&#x27;ve ever encountered. But it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, so who cares if it works?</li>
    <li> It seems to work OK but it smells bad-- not like coconut. My wife finds the odor positively dreadful.</li>
    <li> The skin of my underarms is extremely reactive, so i suddenly get rashes after using products over a period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Its been 3 months since I&#x27;ve started using this and so far its all good, no rash and nicely moisturized skin is all I have to report.&lt;br /&gt;On the odor protection front, this deodorant lasts about 6-8 hours (4-6 hours depending on the weather and activity) before I need to reapply, which is fine since you can reapply without having to shower but the container of deodorant is bulky and not very portable.&lt;br /&gt;One deodorant stick lasts me about 1 month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;This does leave residue on your clothes, not like white marks but rather like a wet spot, specially on light coloured satin fabric, but it does wash off.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice and pleasant, not very strong and definitely better than the unscented ozone layer deodorant.</li>
    <li> The coconut cream smells like rancid oil not coconut!! Returning</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with product it stained and ruined all my tee shirts</li>
    <li> I waited couple weeks before leaving a review. At first i wanted to give this product 1 start because it smells just strange...definitely not like coconut...my guess it&#x27;s ozone. But i gave it a try and i do like it. I do use body spray to mask deodorant smell little bit so it works for me. It&#x27;s the best natural deodorant i&#x27;ve tried so far. I reapply it after i get home from work and i don&#x27;t have any body odor all day. It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes and it&#x27;s easy to apply...you definitely don&#x27;t need a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy coconut again but probably try other scents maybe they are better than this one but i only wish they would make trial/travel sizes because it&#x27;s kinda pricy to buy one and don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s smell again...</li>
    <li> i agree with others that have reviewed. This is so far the best scent. I tried the mint and that one didnt work well for me. I would have needed to reapply faster. The first day i didn&#x27;t need to reapply the coconut at all. Today, i put it on at around 8am and its not even 330pm and i felt like i smelled and had to reapply already. i guess i can say it mostly works but to have to reapply and carry it with me is a bit annoying. I def will try to use it though instead of using regular deodorant too much since i know it isn&#x27;t good for me. However, I may try to see what other brands have good reviews since most of these natural deodorants arent so great. Crystal essence is pretty good but again need to reapply during day i guess since it is summer it doesnt help.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described. The deodorant is hard to apply, and the smell is not for me - I think it&#x27;s the oxygen, but it smells musty to me, and it lingers after application. It doesn&#x27;t hide body odor. I haven&#x27;t been overly active in a while, and sometimes just after an easy day or sleeping even, I can smell a faint smell of odor... I wish it worked better, as I really don&#x27;t want to use aluminum based deodorant, but it&#x27;s just not effective enough for me.</li>
    <li> Is very rough upon applying, it is so rough it removes some of my underarm hair, be careful.&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning to my toms of Maine Deodorant. You do not get a lot for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought the coconut scent and it worked well on a hot day walking my son around a park for a few hours. But understand that this deodorant never actually had a pleasant smell either in the tube or on my pits. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the coconut scent or the ozone-y smell people mention in other reviews but it kinda has a hint of b.o. in the tube or right after you put it on. I measured it&#x27;s effectiveness by the fact that I smelled no different hours later because, again, it doesn&#x27;t smell good anyway. I&#x27;m willing to try one of the other scents though....</li>
    <li> This deodorant has a strong bad smell (just like the other reviewers have mentioned) it&#x27;s soooo strong that my 4 year old noticed when I picked her up, asking why do I smell so funny? lol&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d put it in the morning and by 2pm I&#x27;d start to smell, I won&#x27;t be buying again and I doubt I&#x27;ll finish it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect natural deodorant :(</li>
    <li> This deodorant has such a strange smell. I had high hopes for it, but it really disappointed me. I still have odor issues using it, and it adds a strong scent to my B.O., which I assume is the oxygen. The concept is great, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the executed product. Fast shipping though, and if you can get past the lingering scent, it might be worth it. But by lingering, I mean lingering. This scent will stay on your clothes for a long time, even after washing them. I experienced absolutely no irritation or trouble applying, but I also didn&#x27;t experience body odor relief. Back to the drawing board for me.</li>
    <li> This has such an odd smell to it, I barely put any on and it just kinda stinks....NOTHING like coconut!  As far as I can tell it does work for sweating/body odor, but the smell of this deodorant is almost as bad as having none...</li>
    <li> Smell terrible,but it works</li>
    <li> Yessssssss!!!!!!!!!! After all the searching I found something that works!!!! I do have to reapply occasionally but I dont mind</li>
    <li> Not at all what I was expecting. The fragrance is weird, and the product is sticky when applying.</li>
    <li> This natural deodorant really works! It works all day, and smells so good.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is a winner! My usually stinky tennis-playing teenage son no longer smells like a gardener in summer! The bees wax scent is pleasant too! We have tried myriad natural deodorants and this is the best so far!!</li>
    <li> I returned this. The &amp;#34;ozone&amp;#34; smell makes me nauseated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather smell like BO than smell like this deodorant.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I originally purchased it at a Farmers Market in Carolina Beach NC.  I then got the coconut scent and thought maybe it was marked wrong because it in no way smelled of coconut.  I purchased it online.  I like the new packaging.  I tried the coconut again but there is absolutely no coconut smell!  Maybe next time I will try another scent.  It is the only natural deodorant I have tried that works.</li>
    <li> I was so stoked about this deodorant since my underarms are so sensitive. Normal deo makes them break out and form painful lumps under my skin. I decided to try this stuff out. It keeps my armpits smelling fresh and has no residue or uncomfortable feeling to it. However, the only conundrum I had was the strong and potent smell. To compare it to the closest smell I can think of, I&#x27;d have to say cilantro. It is exactly like rubbing a handful of those soapy leaves on your underarms. If you love cilantro, that&#x27;s great! However, if you dislike it, as in my case, this can pose as a problem.</li>
    <li> I started using this deodorant 6 months ago and it is the only one I use now.  Two sticks lasted me 7+ months, so I also appreciate the value.  I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants and this one is my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t melt, so you can take it with you if you need to reapply.  It&#x27;s not rough on the skin like some deodorants with baking soda. My body naturally tends to sweat a lot, so I do still sweat. In my opinion, if you&#x27;re body needs to sweat, let it sweat! It&#x27;s natural and something I&#x27;ve come to terms with.  The best and most important part of the product is its ability to mask the odor of sweat.  I personally like the smell and don&#x27;t find it odd....some getting used to maybe.  I&#x27;ve only ever bought coconut, but I like it!  In the beginning, I still noticed some odor by the end of the day.  After months of use, I think it&#x27;s doing a better job and I don&#x27;t notice a smell at the end of the day anymore!  Maybe the formula changed a bit or maybe my body just got used to it.  Regardless, it&#x27;s safe for your body, no disgusting chemicals and works just as well as Secret did.  I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for this, it has a very strong odd smell to it. It didn&#x27;t work for me either. Also definitely did not smell like coconut, or anything other than this this candle wax or beeswax odor. Love that it is only a couple familiar ingredients, but it didn&#x27;t do it for me - bummer!</li>
    <li> This is only the second natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried, just recently making the switch from the normal store bought stuff.  With the other brand I was really impressed with how well it worked, however my skin was not a fan so I looked again.  After trying the ozone w/ coconut scent for a few days I am less than impressed with it.  The ozone smell is really strong but I could live with that. But I want a deodorant I do not have to apply multiple times a day, and I am not a heavy sweater.  I figure I will give it a couple more days but I expect to be returning it.</li>
    <li> I have to say that as much as I like to ozinate the air at my house, the smell of the deodorant is too strong - and I didn&#x27;t feel like I started my day clean and smelling nice(and I don&#x27;t wear perfume/synthetic smells). And then as my day went on I didn&#x27;t smell any better. I really wanted to love this, it seems like a brilliant idea.</li>
    <li> Was beginning my search for a natural deodorant, as I had boughten one not long ago, but the smell was too much to handle. I give the Ozone Layer Deodorant a 5 star as it does exactly what it says… and only 2 ingredients. Pretty awesome! The smell is not the creamy coconut you would get with other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; deodorants, and at first I was worried as it has a peculiar smell that is fairly strong. It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad smell, it&#x27;s just a smell (I&#x27;m really picky about deodorant smells, if you haven&#x27;t already noticed.) I found that after wearing it an hour or two the smell fades drastically, but it continues to work. Even will work longer than 24 hours, and yes, I&#x27;ve gotten sweaty during those times. While I wish it had a sweeter smell, it is the best working and smelling….and most natural deodorant I have found so I will stay a customer and recommend it to anyone who is considering it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now, and, so far, I am extremely pleased.  It actually seems to work really well for me.  Objectively, a lot of people may not like the smell.  It has almost a citronella scent to it, but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  Also, the smell tends to fade as the day goes by, becoming hardly detectable in the evening.  Personally, the smell is not offensive to me.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses this Ozone Layer Deodorant scent and loves the smell! She had heard of the cancer causing ingredients in her old deodorant and decided to make the switch this past May, she loves it!</li>
    <li> Good product and will be purchasing again.  Love the story behind the couple who started their business.  It was told in a letter that came with it.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully!  Even reduces sweating.  You can really smell the ozone which I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
    <li> I want to love this so bad!!!!  I had originally tried to make my own deodorant at home using baking soda but the baking soda just tore my underarms up, so I started looking around for an alternative.  I saw this and saw that it had great reviews.  I ordered it and used it, I&#x27;m on day 2, this product does not help with odor control.  I smell like a homeless man.  I need something to help absorb the odor and be natural as well.  I&#x27;m so bummed.  It got 3 stars cause it smells nice.</li>
    <li> I have tried no less than 10 natural deodorant that just do not work.  They either smell horrible or do nothing to prevent odor.  I&#x27;m not a big sweater and never had issues with traditional deodorant but I&#x27;m trying to lead a healthier life wirh less chemicals for myself and my family. Aluminum in store brands are being linked to cancer.  This deodorant offers pretty good protection I would say at least 12+ hrs.  It doesn&#x27;t have the best smell,  my husband calls it &amp;#34;hippy smell&amp;#34; you can definitely pick up the beeswax in it. I was getting tired of the essential oil scented ones so I chose a plain scented version on purpose. I like the very limited ingredients are healthy on my skin.</li>
    <li> I feel like it makes me more smelly then helping the other way around</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this as a natural alternative deodorant but the smell is horrible. I don&#x27;t know if the deodorant would work or not because I had to wash it off shortly after applying it as I couldn&#x27;t stand the overpowering smell after I put it on. I ordered the coconut scent and it smelled NOTHING like coconut. Very disappointed. I bought the unscented for my son to try as he has sensory issues but it smells bad too.</li>
    <li> I have tried a ton of different all natural deodorants and none of them have ever been able to keep me from stinking by the end of my workday. This one has! It definitely does not smell like coconut but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. And you can really reapply it if you do start to stink and it gets rid of the odor. I will be using this deodorant from now on!!</li>
    <li> This deodorant totally does it&#x27;s job of keeping the smell of body odor at bay, but I can&#x27;t quite make up my mind about the scent. Sometimes it smells good to me, but other times it makes me nauseous...? I will definitely buy the product again, but will try a different scent.</li>
    <li> The good:  Though the initial cost is high, it does last for a long time, so overall it has the equivalent, if not less, cost of traditional deodorant.  No irritation of any kind. I recently started having sensitivities from mainstream deodorants, so that was why I went on natural deodorant search, which led me to this brand. It is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: The smell is not pleasant. It is close to the funk that you are trying to prevent. I have two degrees of armpits. One is generally easy to manage, one you better come strong or else. I have found traditional deodorants that can handle my strong armpit, but this one is not up to the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not completely blast this product, as I believe it may work for some people, just not for me.</li>
    <li> It has a rather off putting odor...is it supposed to? Said coconut but not a whif!</li>
    <li> Smells great,  works well when it&#x27;s not hot!</li>
    <li> I love the smell.  It is mild and sweet. This product does work on odor but must be reapplied about half way through the day.  Odor instantly disappears after you reapply it.  You don&#x27;t have to wash your pits first.  I will try another brand after I use this one up.  It is still better than using a product with aluminum in it.  I would rather smell a little than poison myself.  Priorities people :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having problems with a red itchy rash from my regular so I was a little hesitant to apply anything else to my under arms  but the ozone layer deodorant actually seemed to sooth the rash which was a welcome relief.  For me it works fine for day to day use but I&#x27;ve not tested it during any kind of physical activity.  Otherwise it&#x27;s gentle on your skin and has a light almost green like fragrance. The one that I picked up is supposed to be coconut scented but to me really doesn&#x27;t smell anything like coconuts.</li>
    <li> Works nicely but it smells strange. I don&#x27;t really use it bc of that. Smells like citronella for Mosquitos repellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like them to smell better but it works</li>
    <li> This product did not work well for me.  The Arm &amp; Hammer natural deodorant works better.</li>
    <li> First, let me say ... this deodorant does a nice job fighting odor. However, that may be from the very strong beeswax smell. If you don&#x27;t mind an overpowering beeswax scent, then this is a great deodorant for fighting underarm odor. My daughter &amp; I really wanted to like this product but the strong beeswax smell made both of us nauseous. The quest for a natural organic deodorant continues.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for blocking sweat and odor.  However, it&#x27;s scent (which is natural) is a little &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell. Makes you sick to your stomach.</li>
    <li> wierd smell. didnt last as long as i thought it would for all the great reviews</li>
    <li> I ordered this after having purchased the unscented and finding it not quite to my liking. I was happy to find that the coconut scented version was much more appealing, and the scent hid the sharp ozone odor of the straight deodorant. It works all day, and doesn&#x27;t make me smell strange. I&#x27;ve found if I use too much, it actually tends to be less effective, so I have to overcome that impulse to slather it heavily on my armpits! It also has a bit of a strong syrupy smell if you use too much. If you use the right amount, it has a light almost pineapple-y smell that fades gradually throughout the day. I&#x27;m very happy that I found a natural deodorant with no junk in it, that ACTUALLY works!</li>
