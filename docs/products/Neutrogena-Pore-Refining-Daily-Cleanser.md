      <li>Price was great for the value</li>
      <li>It is great to travel with.</li>
      <li>Both are great products.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s product doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel clean and doesn&#x27;t smell very good either.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>My skins is looking great with twice weekly use of this light exfoliating cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I use it as a kind of mask.</li>
      <li>After just two weeks use I found my press wee once again fine and almost unnoticeable!</li>
      <li>Still love this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>but I still really love how this leaves my very-sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I simply love it.</li>
      <li>I love this cleanser for my middle-aged skin.</li>
      <li>but I love it.  </li>
      <li>The pore refining cleanser is an okay product.</li>
      <li>I have used better products before.  </li>
      <li>I have large, often blocked pores on my nose and using it in the shower after my skin has steamed a bit is very effective.</li>
      <li>But it works if you need something strong.</li>
      <li>I did a good amount of research on highly recommended pre refining products and Behrens received some of the highest user and expert ratings.</li>
      <li>Leaves your face clean and smooth</li>
      <li>I have been using it from past 6 months cleans skin perfectly</li>
      <li>I helps clean my face.</li>
      <li>Nothing special about this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>A favorite gentle exfoliating cleanser of mine.</li>
      <li>I have somewhat large pores, so I was really hoping this would help.</li>
      <li>BHA and AHA combo work effectively to chemically (and gently) remove dead skin cells while also helping to prevent breakouts.</li>
      <li>The cleanser really stings.</li>
      <li>the cleanser really burns.</li>
      <li>This Neutrogena product worked really well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it scrubs very well.</li>
      <li>Prior to getting this, I&#x27;d thought that, as long as I&#x27;m using so many cleansers and treatments, it shouldn&#x27;t matter what I wash with, but this does make my skin feel cleaner and healthier.</li>
      <li>Too thin to do much good.</li>
      <li>With daily use, I can really notice how it changes how much I can see the pores on my face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s certainly one of my go to daily cleaners.</li>
      <li>This product really removes the oil from my facial skin and prevent clog sweat gland formation.</li>
      <li>I have combination mature skin, and I use this product every night.</li>
      <li>Overall though, I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my complexion, so I&#x27;d highly recommend this even though it&#x27;s not magic.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product as a general facial cleanser with additional acid and exfoliate benefits.</li>
      <li>so be careful not to squeeze out too much as any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
      <li>Unless you really have an acne/pimp problem due to oil skin I would not recommend it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Burns eyes, need to rise well before opening eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It makes my skin feel great!  It&#x27;s hard to find a facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or make it too oily.  This works great for me!</li>
    <li> Too thin to do much good.</li>
    <li> A favorite gentle exfoliating cleanser of mine. Two years ago I started noticing my pores a lot and that distressed me. I did a good amount of research on highly recommended pre refining products and Behrens received some of the highest user and expert ratings. After just two weeks use I found my press wee once again fine and almost unnoticeable! It&#x27;s certainly one of my go to daily cleaners. The other is Aveeno&#x27;s brightening exfoliating scrub. It&#x27;s a bit coarser and thick going on but leaves my skin shining and does brighten darker areas on my cheeks which can occur during the summer and evens my skin tone. So, when I want a bit deeper exploration I use Aveeno. Both are great products.</li>
    <li> With daily use, I can really notice how it changes how much I can see the pores on my face. It&#x27;s really too bad there&#x27;s not a pore refining medicated facial scrub that removes blackheads. For this reason alone, I use another product to exfoliate with so I have to alternate. If I have to travel for a weekend, this is the only cleanser I&#x27;ll bring with me. Be careful not to let it drip into your eyes (it burns) but I still really love how this leaves my very-sensitive skin. I simply love it.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this cleanser.  My pores look the same after several months of use.</li>
    <li> My skins is looking great with twice weekly use of this light exfoliating cleanser.  Good price too!</li>
    <li> I have somewhat large pores, so I was really hoping this would help. I use it once a day and it immediately shrinks and clears them out considerably, though they get bad again the next day. Overall though, I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my complexion, so I&#x27;d highly recommend this even though it&#x27;s not magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BHA and AHA combo work effectively to chemically (and gently) remove dead skin cells while also helping to prevent breakouts. It also has a slightly grainy texture to act as a physical exfoliate. I would highly recommend this product as a general facial cleanser with additional acid and exfoliate benefits.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates but causes redness and stings horribly if it gets in my eyes.</li>
    <li> I use it as a kind of mask. I put it on and massage into my skin, adding water as needed. I let is sit stay on my skin while I do things around the house, and then I wash it off. I think my skin is improved since using it. Prior to getting this, I&#x27;d thought that, as long as I&#x27;m using so many cleansers and treatments, it shouldn&#x27;t matter what I wash with, but this does make my skin feel cleaner and healthier.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser for my middle-aged skin. I have large, often blocked pores on my nose and using it in the shower after my skin has steamed a bit is very effective. It cleans the excess oil from my pores and exfoliates without being overly drying. My pores appear smaller for several hours, although it&#x27;s not a permanent change.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser.  It works as well as any expensive product. A little goes a long way so be careful not to squeeze out too much as any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still love this cleanser.  Now I use it as an all over cleanser.  It is great to travel with.</li>
    <li> This Neutrogena product worked really well. I helps clean my face. I work out 5 to 6 days per week, and I sweat a lot during my work out. This product really removes the oil from my facial skin and prevent clog sweat gland formation. However, it is really harsh. Unless you really have an acne/pimp problem due to oil skin I would not recommend it. After washing my facial skin feels really tight, like a layer of outer skin cells have been removed. The cleanser really stings. If there are breaks or damage to your skin the cleanser really burns. During my washes my eyes and lips have suffered from stings and burning sensation. I plan to use up what soap I have left and stop using this product. It is just too harsh for me. But it works if you need something strong.</li>
    <li> Great formula! Leaves your face clean and smooth</li>
    <li> I have been using it from past 6 months cleans skin perfectly</li>
    <li> Price was great for the value</li>
    <li> My skin loves this stuff! I have combination mature skin, and I use this product every night.</li>
    <li> The pore refining cleanser is an okay product. I have used better products before.  The abrasives used in this product aren&#x27;t as harsh as I would like. I don&#x27;t feel like it scrubs very well. I am use to using St. Ives daily apricot face cleanser which some can find too hard on the face but I love it.  Neutrogena&#x27;s product doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel clean and doesn&#x27;t smell very good either.</li>
