<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great tweezer set. They come in a beautiful box and are perfect as a gift. I was tempted to save it for a gift because they come already in gift packaging but I wanted to keep them myself.</li>
    <li> These are sharp!  Be careful when using them. :)  They are super well made and the best tweezer set I have ever had. The quality is outstanding! I can see these making an impressive gift. The packaging had every attention to detail! So cute and well done.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this tweezer set.  The packaging was so creative and  the craftsmanship is super ....from the quality to the performance!  They are just awesome!  Highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> The pictures are true to life. The tweezer set arrives in a beautiful box with a ribbon and a gold stamp on it making you feel like a kid on Christmas morning opening your gifts again. I immediately tried them out because a lot of tweezers look to be the highest of quality, but then they don&#x27;t work. This is not the case with these. They get a good grip on your hair and pull cleanly without pinching your skin. I can go on and on...I will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> This tweezer set by Wick &amp; Str&amp;ouml;m are the best set of tweezers that I have tried. All three of them work great, too! You can really tell that these are very high quality tweezers. I absolutely love them! They grip onto tiny hairs so easily every single time. The small ones come with this cute little cap, which is really great for putting in your purse. I take one of those with me everywhere, gave one to my hubby, and keep the regular pair at home. These are most definitely worth the price. They would really make an awesome gift, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in the most amazing packaging ever, and that&#x27;s a huge plus for me. Inside a big test tube is some decorative paper, the regular sized tweezers, and the two little mini tweezers. That is closed off with a cork and inside a beautiful brown box filled with more decorative paper and tied with a ribbon. The tweezers all work great, too! You can really tell that these are very high quality tweezers. I absolutely love them! They grip onto tiny hairs so easily every single time. The small ones come with this cute little cap, which is really great for putting in your purse. I take one of those with me everywhere, gave one to my hubby, and keep the regular pair at home. These are most definitely worth the price. They would really make an awesome gift, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used, I typically use Tweezer Man</li>
    <li> The really are &amp;#34;precision tweezers&amp;#34; - the sharpest, most exacting tweezers I have ever seen.  Beautifully packaged - would make a lovely gift.  I will never have to buy another pair of tweezers, but if I do, they will be Wick &amp; Strom.  No comparison with other tweezers - these are the best.</li>
    <li> I received the Tweezer Set at a discount for an honest review. The packaging and presentation is top notch. The tweezers themselves are very nicely made. Basically they do what they are meant to do. Would I have paid full price? maybe not, but if you are looking for a nice gift, this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Great set. The tweezers are amazing. I&#x27;ve never used better tweezer !</li>
    <li> Not the greatest pair of tweezers,  I thought they were at first but I couldn&#x27;t pull the shorter hairs like I could with my revelon tweezers</li>
    <li> Perfect set of tweezers! I love the fact that they pink. They work great. Thank Goodness they are well made and not cheap! Worked very well on those stubborn little hairs!&lt;br /&gt;f you&#x27;ve ever dealt with low quality tweezers, you&#x27;ll know how frustrating and time consuming it is to shape and pluck your eyebrows. The Excalibur Collection is specifically designed to grab on to even the tiniest hairs and make it effortless to pluck them out-making shaping your eyebrows incredibly easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Just received this kit.  Phenomenal quality.</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers! They are not quite the quality I have seen in a few others, but for the price, they are my preferred alternative. They get the small blond hairs that are not too noticeable, but just noticeable when I put on my makeup. I haven&#x27;t gone a drugstore alternative, besides tweezerman, for such a great price. I recommend!!</li>
    <li> This set is really great. The big tweezers work way better than the other brand i usually buy, And the packaging is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever seen. I love a company with great products and one that takes time to package things neatly and carefully.  It was almost like receiving a gift.</li>
    <li> Very nice tweezers...3 pk....one for my purse, travel bag, and one to use at home.  The packaging was also lovely!</li>
    <li> Love the 3 sizes! You put it all together in one place.</li>
    <li> Great set of tweezers, very nice packing (would recommend as a wonderful idea for a present). Delivered as promised. Awesome customer service, one of the tweezers was not quite working well, and they sent me a new one super quickly. Very good quality overall.</li>
    <li> The presentation of this product is so nice.  It comes in a nice package, wrapped in little boxes...would make a really nice gift.  But more than that, the tweezers seems to be of really good quality!  Sturdy and grabs great.</li>
    <li> Two of the tweezers work great, however, one of the small tweezers is useless. Disappointed, otherwise this set would have gotten a five star rating from me.</li>
    <li> If you give 5 stars just for presentation value, Wick &amp; Strom has my vote. However, not only is this packaged luxuriously, the tweezers are exquisite! They are well crafted and quality tweezers. These are not your drug store tweezers. These are precise. It is exceptionally nice to have two pair of tweezers for travel and the larger pair for home. Wick &amp; Strom has just replaced every set of disappointing tweezers I have ever purchased! No more missing those little hairs that you can feel and see but cannot get.</li>
    <li> Great easy to use! So precise work great awesome packaging. Tweezers are not just tweezers anymore wick and strom took it to a whole new level!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice packaging and terrific customer service. I was not completely impressed with my original order of the full size treezer, so  Sarah Maria of the Customer Care Team @ Wick &amp; Ström immediately sent a &#x27;hand picked&#x27; replacement. This replacement seems to be made better &amp; work very well....more like it is advertized to work. I have not tried the mini tweezers yet, but the little case is nice and I&#x27;m sure they will come in handy in a medical supply box kept in the car.</li>
    <li> This is an impressive set.  First I was wowed by the packaging - it was so lovely, like I was giving myself a gift!  I had forgotten that I had ordered the tweezers and couldn&#x27;t imagine what was inside this box!  Well after using them, I understood why they were packaged like a gift.  It really is a gift when we buy ourselves something of high quality.  Until you use this set you will never know that you took twice as long to tweeze as you needed to because your old tweezers could never compare to the quality and precision of these.  Should have given me this gift years ago!  haha!  I would say I will buy again, but know I won&#x27;t need to as this is a set designed to last forever.  I will certainly put it on my gift list for other special ladies in my life though.</li>
    <li> I love the quality and that there is more than one tweezer.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the packaging of these tweezers it&#x27;s very chic and beautiful I loved it this would make a wonderful present. These tweezers are made from stainless steel that&#x27;s forged by fire in Solingen, Germany, this is definitely a high quality set of tweezers it includes 3 tweezers 1 regular size and 2 mini tweezers with a built in carrying case for travel. The tweezers are light, sturdy and durable they are great for plucking fine and thick eyebrow hair and they make it super easy to get a good grip on the tiniest hair without breaking it unlike other tweezers. These tweezers make it easier to shape my eyebrows and they are really convenient  I put one of the mini tweezers in my make up bag so I can take it everywhere I go because honestly you never know when you will be needing some tweezers Lol. I don&#x27;t know if you guys occasionally use eyebrow stencils but I do every now and then and I noticed that these twezzers make it so much easier. I definitely recommend this set to anyone who wants more define eyebrows.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are amazing!  I really like the small sharp ones.</li>
    <li> This tweezer set is very nice. They are made of stainless steel so I don&#x27;t have to worry about them ever rusting or staining. They&#x27;re durable and will last a long time. I like that you get two smaller tweezers. I can now carry one in my purse and one when I travel. They&#x27;re small and convenient. They all have very fine, sharp tips. This makes tweezing less of a hassle. You can remove hair more quickly and effectively. I can also remove splinters without causing more pain. I was happy to have been given the opportunity to sample and test this product at a special price, and share my experiences and feedback. This tweezer set is definitely something I would recommend everyone have.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Love the packaging.  Makes a nice gift.</li>
    <li> Extremely well made. Perfect tips, exact alignment, catches even the smallest hair. Package is beautiful as well; would make a terrific gift.</li>
    <li> This set is absolutely gorgeous! The quality of tools is exemplary, but the presentation was the biggest surprise. You can tell attention to detail is important to them and I now only use these tweezers.</li>
    <li> I have chin whiskers, and I have to almost constantly pluck them out to keep from looking like one of my great aunts that everyone knew as &amp;#34;the lady with all the facial hair&amp;#34;! I know I am not the only one who has been blessed with these genes! If you are like me, you like to have a good pair of tweezers to grip the hairs as they first begin to grow, so they never become noticeable. The bad thing, though, is that a good pair of tweezers - the kind that will grip and pull out hairs that are barely above the skin- are hard to find. I received this Wick &amp; Strom tweezer set at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. These are very high quality tweezers, and I am glad I was able to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was how beautifully packaged they were when they arrived. They are in a nice textured cardboard box with a gold accented thread embellishing the outside of the box.  When you lift the lid of the box, it is tied inside with a golden satiny ribbon. Beneath the ribbon is a clear plastic vial, sealed with a cork, that contains the tweezers. The vial itself, and the tweezers inside the vial, are both nestled in some thin wood shavings. It is very beautiful, and elegantly packaged! My first thought was that these would make a nice gift for someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three pairs of tweezers inside the vial. One full sized pair, that is very craftily made, and two smaller pairs, that are self-contained inside  their own little cases. These would be perfect for travel, or for keeping in your vehicle or in your bag, for on the go uses.  The tweezers themselves are stainless steel, forged by fire in Solingen, Germany, also known as &amp;#34;The City of Blades&amp;#34; because of its strong history as a location where blacksmiths were well know for their hand-forged battle swords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are nice and sharp, and have slanted tips, so they can easily grip even the smallest hair or splinter. The tips are lined up perfectly, and help ensure that you get a good grip on whatever you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very high quality tweezers, and I would quickly recommend them to any of my friends!ensure that you get a good grip on whatever you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very high quality tweezers, and I would quickly recommend them to any of my friends!</li>
    <li> This is a great set of tweezers. I have used them for cosmetic purposes and also to remove splinters. I highly recommend this tweezer set.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these tweezers!! They are so nice to have. I love them. Thank you</li>
    <li> First thing I noticed was the packaging..which was beautiful. It comes in such great packaging that I did not want to open it at first.  I did finally open it and really like the tweezers.  They are nice quality and are great for my eyebrows.  no complaints!</li>
    <li> I thought that tweezers were a simple tool, and that there would not be a significant difference between manufacturers.  I was wrong!  First, you can feel the quality of these tweezers in your hand.  Second, they are much more accurate, resulting in a fewer retries.  In the end, the quality of these tweezers really makes a difference in their performance.</li>
    <li> Once upon a time I thought tweezers were tweezers. Then the Wick &amp; Strom Tweezer set arrived and I&#x27;m feeling like a rockstar. Let&#x27;s begin with the packaging. It is detailed, beautiful and elegant. It makes you feel beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the hand, Wick &amp; Strom tweezers difference is noticeable. FORGED BY FIRE IN SOLINGEN, GERMANY obviously is something to boast about. Thinking these tweezers were made with the same precise method of blacksmithing as fine swords and knives has me in awe! 2,000 years of perfecting craftsmanship in the palm of my hand, or gripped between my fingers. That&#x27;s impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between my fingers I can tell the difference. They are precise! Without effort they remove the finest hairs. I can pluck hairs like a pro--even with my poor eyesight! The Wick&amp; Strom Tweezers grab the hair and hold on while I pluck! My eyebrows are looking more precise, more defined since using these. Wick &amp; Strom Tweezers aren&#x27;t even hair bigots, like my old tweezers, nope! Wick &amp; Strom will take the fine, baby hair or the short, stubby, coarse hair and remove it. My ingrown hairs are now gone because Wick &amp; Strom holds on to the hair as I pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this tweezer set. From the packaging to the craftsmanship....from the quality to the performance! Wick &amp; Strom is amazing. They know this, which is why they guarantee your purchase of the Wick &amp; Str&amp;ouml;m Excalibur Collection for life with their 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. If for any reason you aren&#x27;t satisfied with your set, let thems know immediately and they will either send a replacement set for no cost, or give you a full, 100% refund. No questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Wick &amp; Strom Tweezer Set at a discounted price in order to facilitate an honest review. All opinions remain my own.</li>
    <li> The packaging is amazing however I did not find the performance to be up to standard, Not very precise. I will get some use out of these for travel but will not replace the ones in my bathroom by any means.</li>
    <li> Loved the set! Extremely well and fashionably packaged.  Perfect as a gift and no need to wrap it is so attractively shipped.  The tweezers work extremely well.</li>
    <li> Excellent set of tweezers that came in the most amazing packaging.  Great gift!  I especially like the smallest tweezer that fits so well in a purse.  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are very nice, I love the three different sizes</li>
    <li> A great surprised tweezer set! Well packed and yet so elegant! When I saw this tweezer set, the packaging was amazing, I just had to take the photos of it, and show it to my friends later. Then after taking out the tweezers, more amazed about the quality of the  tweezers. They are just like the product page described, the highest possible professional quality!!! There is no doubt that the sale page described that each tweezer is manually painted, sanded using white polishing stones, and stamped using an eccentric press which means every tweezer is unique in its own way. No other professional beauty tool features such personal and emotional details. I can&#x27;t help it but pick up the tweezer starting fixing and clean up my eye blows and the between eye lids. I&#x27;m so happy with the result, it is so easuily and precisely to pull up the hairs without making mistakes. Unlike the usual tweezer, easy to slip away and hurting the skin. I even can clean up those fine hairs using those tweezers. Now I&#x27;m leaving the long tweezer at home, and put one pair in my purse, and leave one pair for spare and travel. The best tweezer I have got so far. I&#x27;m just so lucky to have the chance to  get to know and review the product within it&#x27;s promotion sale, and happily to share my photos with you all. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this tweezer set for my husband. I am pretty impressed that it is actually made  in Germany. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> First I have to say these come very nicely packaged and would make a great gift for someone looking for tweezers! You get 3 pair of tweezers - one larger and 2 smaller ones with covers. I love the larger ones! Being a cosmetologist I have owned and used many tweezers (some very pricy ones too) and these may be the best ones I have tried! The smaller ones are ok too - and with the covers are great for keeping an extra in your make-up bag or first aid kit. I would definitely recommend this set for the price - just the larger pair is well worth it!</li>
    <li> I had another pair of German made tweezers for about 14 years and they finally lost the ability to work well.  I&#x27;ve tried other tweezers but have failed to find a pair that could replace my other pair.  These are packaged well (as everyone has said) but functionality is more important to me.  These are an 8.5 out of 10.  They are larger than my last pair and are not as easily handled.  The 2 smaller pairs are not very useful - maybe good for something other than tweezing eyebrows.  They are more functional than anything else I&#x27;ve tried for the last year.</li>
    <li> LOVE love this set! The smaller tweezers can fit in my purse and in my car for on the go! Loved the packaging too! Super cute!</li>
    <li> this is a very nice tweezer.  i&#x27;m not exactly sure what the 2 small ones are for, but the large one works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Phenomenal. Multiple pairs to keep at work, in the car (for emergencies)and home. Packaging is lovely. Gave it to a co-worker to reuse</li>
    <li> Great customer service!  I had originally not been impressed with the smaller tweezers due to the fact that they were not up to par (a little mishapen).  The company sent me two replacements, and those are fantastic!  It was very much appreciated, and I am very happy with the tweezers.  You don&#x27;t see customer service like that very often anymore.  I would definetly recommend these tweezers.</li>
    <li> its like u get a set for every aspect of your daily routine. so far I havent pinched myself.what else can u ask for.</li>
    <li> I would like to start out by saying that they arrived in a beautiful box the packaging was very nice. The polity of the tweezers are excellent I love the little travel ones that they threw in those are perfect for my purse or my make up bag. The tip of the tweezers are excellent the  grip is as well. I highly highly recommend these tweezers.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are fantastic.  I normally use Tweezerman tweezers and these slanted ones are right up there next to them.  They&#x27;re very sharp and precise and come packaged really nice (great gift).  Plus, who wouldn&#x27;t love the little emergency tweezers!</li>
    <li> While attempting to pluck the brow the tweezers missed time and again. Had to switch to my old set to accomplish the goal.</li>
    <li> The main tweezers do not meet well at the gripping edges. They are not as good as my (lost) Revlon tweezers from the drugstore.  Update: The customer service team at Wick &amp; Strom saw my review and sent me a free replacement pair of tweezers without my even asking, along with a very nice note. I&#x27;m really impressed and have updated my review to reflect the quality of the customer service and the replacement pair. Thanks!</li>
    <li> At first we loved these tweezers. But it seems like they got dull very quickly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this tweezer set with one thing in mind: I have very fine hairs that grow out of my nose and ears that need to be removed from time to time. Yeah, it&#x27;s true. In the past most tweezers I use just won&#x27;t grab onto the finer hairs. I was hoping that these would work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the set in a rather fancy gift package as pictured. I thought, &amp;#34;ok, but do these things work?&amp;#34; I took them out and went to my magnifying mirror and gave them a test drive. I was very disappointed. I looked closer at the ends of the tweezers and frankly there didn&#x27;t line up well and well, they just didn&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got an email from Wick and Strom asking me about my experience with the tweezers and I gave them an honest appraisal. They immediately refunded my purchase and sent me another set that they said was hand picked. I&#x27;m pleased to report that the second set lived up to my expectations - they work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give them a BIG 5 stars for customer service, however they lose one star for not getting it right the first time - but you should feel secure in knowing that they will absolutely make it right.</li>
