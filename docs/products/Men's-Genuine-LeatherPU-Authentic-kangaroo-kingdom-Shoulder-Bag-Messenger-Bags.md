<li> what kind of size is that... awful bag..</li>
<li> it is way too small.</li>
<li> None of the unnecessary girlie decorations on the exterior.  </li>
<li> and I can avoid the dangerous habit of leaving it in the grocery cart while I get produce and items off the shelves.  </li>
<li> I brought it because of leather but disappointed.</li>

    <li> Very nice bag, but it is way too small. My iPad mini barely fit inside of it. The material seemed nice and the clamps did not seem to be cheaply made. Nice bag, but want to small. More like a small purse.</li>
    <li> I loved this bag..used it everyday..but then a zipper broke..then another zipper pull came off, then then strap started to come off the side.  Now I am scared to get another. I loved the size..it fit into my drawer of small locker at work. But it didn&#x27;t last long. If the fixed these issues..I would buy every color.</li>
    <li> Good looking bag BUT shown sizes are at least 3/4&amp;#34; short all around (actually closer to an inch off).  Bag is so small that an iPad MINI barely fits in.</li>
    <li> Bought for a family member, arrived on time and they loved it. Price was great too.</li>
    <li> Love It!!! About to order another one..Also it arrived a week early. .</li>
    <li> Nice bag. Real leather, but small top opening.</li>
    <li> Good looking bag a little small.But very expensive looking&amp; very elegant &amp; music line looking.Thanks!</li>
    <li> what kind of size is that... awful bag.. i am returning it..</li>
    <li> it was smaller than described so i had to return it which cost almost as much as the bag.</li>
    <li> Was very nice....and price was great , but soon handle broke and there was nithing i could do to fix it....</li>
    <li> Beautifull, practical and super fashion. Love it.</li>
    <li> sooo good and high quality !!</li>
    <li> my fiance liked it. The size small is good for main male things. The material is a mixture, but looks durable.</li>
    <li> No leather only PVC, looks nice and well finishing. I brought it because of leather but disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought this understanding exactly what i was probably in for, after reading some of the reviews; bag was too small, too feminine, compartments not large enough. But i was pleasantly surprised. Came packaged neatly.No gasoline smell, as mentioned by some comments.Great sheen to the bag- beautiful really. A bit small for my tastes, but for only twenty bones a very sophisticated piece of work my Nexus 7 and other comfort gadgets fits into with ease.</li>
    <li> The strap doesn&#x27;t stay attached to the bag which for my purposed makes it usless</li>
    <li> These are cool bags for the price.  Functional with a long adjustable strap.  Vendor delivered way ahead of schedule.  Was very pleased with the service.</li>
    <li> This may say that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; bag, but I ordered both the black and brown one for me (a woman).  I LOVE them.  None of the unnecessary girlie decorations on the exterior.  Seem to be well constructed.  Keeps my hands and arms free when shopping - and I can avoid the dangerous habit of leaving it in the grocery cart while I get produce and items off the shelves.  Job well-done on this item.  Thank you, thank you.</li>
