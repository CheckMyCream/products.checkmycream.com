      <li>Oil of Olay Pro-X Even Spot Fading treatment is an amazing product, as are so many Oil of Olay products.going to be home, otherwise I put on a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can still see the spots in bright light</li>
      <li>I thought the Regenerist line was my favorite</li>
      <li>Plus the texture of the area is now smooth!  </li>
      <li>Awesome when a product actually works.</li>
      <li>I made sure he looked at the spots before I started to use it</li>
      <li>But having done nothing at all, it doesn&#x27;t deserve more stars either.</li>

      <li>I love the packaging of this product.</li>
      <li>I tried cliniques even better spot removal, and it did nothing.</li>
      <li>love the Olay Regenerist line and have used it since Prescriptives went out of business.</li>
      <li>It works better and faster on newer scars.</li>
      <li>I made sure he looked at the spots before I started to use it</li>
      <li>sometimes more.</li>
      <li>but I think it will work just as well or even better with a pump bottle.</li>
      <li>I thought the Regenerist line was my favorite</li>
      <li>and I have tried most of them.</li>
      <li>; every now and again where it was a tad bit more noticeable and sore to the touch.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle of them being erased, but for a product that retails at a figure close to $50 I did expect to be able to see some change.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the most extraordinary skin products I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>Heard that it&#x27;s a very good serum but couldn&#x27;t buy it locally.  </li>
      <li>So far my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>My skin scars really easily</li>
      <li>My regimen is easy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first time that I been using Olay products,these products are amazing.</li>
      <li>I have sun spots on my face from swimming an average of six hours a day for about 7 wonderful years when my family lived in a town with a nearby lake.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly this has started to work, and that I can see a noticible difference!</li>
      <li>People are always very surprised when I tell them my age, most say 10-15 years younger, but I&#x27;ve always taken excellent care of my skin.</li>
      <li>Huge difference in about three weeks.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for a light brown spot that showed up on my face about 2-3 years ago.  </li>
      <li>The skin product helps your skin stay smooth to the touch</li>
      <li>reviews on this product were split, it seemed that either it produced no results or fantastic results.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>This was my original post from 2015:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really an amazing product, my skin turns soft and smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>After showing it to my boyfriend who has been dealing with mild eczema on his hands for most of his life, told me that it looked exactly like his and proceeded to show me.  </li>
      <li>but really wanted something more</li>
      <li>followthis with a good moisturizer and eye cream and sunscreen daily.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I didn&#x27;t try it on my face.</li>
      <li>But this pro-x one is much more effective and much cheaper at the same time.</li>
      <li>Works over time, love the feel on my skin and no reactions on my very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Overall, my skin condition is very good, but I have been struggling with melasma patches on both cheeks and it was also starting to show up on my forehead.</li>
      <li>2nd bottle is where you see amazing results.</li>
      <li>Actually, I&#x27;m fortunate that I didn&#x27;t really like to lie in the sun or the damage would be worse.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and so far so good.</li>
      <li>As a loyal and satisfied user of Olay Pro-X, Olay Regenerist, and Olay Total Effects 7, I was hopeful about this product.</li>
      <li>It is a good treatment in place of lasers which I also did on the really dark spots.</li>
      <li>, now don&#x27;t get me wrong its probably a great product for many ladies out there ,but not for mine  </li>
      <li>This product did a pretty good job at getting rid of my dark spots.</li>
      <li>Also have you noticed that they have so many products for the same ailment?</li>
      <li>but you have to be consistent and use every day till the product is gone.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to use enough sunscreen in the morning not to affect the process.</li>
      <li>and this helped fade those new scars rather quickly.</li>
      <li>As an added bonus, this lotion (it&#x27;s thicker than a serum but not quite as thick as a true lotion would be) feels amazing on your face, and softens your skin.</li>
      <li>tried Hydroquinolone for years, doing 3 months on and 3 months off, but the spots faded to a certain point and then stopped.</li>
      <li>I saw slow but good improvement in my overall skin tone and newer scars and I am confident that with continued use, the older scars will lighten as well.</li>
      <li>(alternating with gentle hydrating cleanser)</li>
      <li>This dropper style is very unhygienic and also results in a lot of wastage of the product.</li>
      <li>Frangrabce free is key as well as consist use and staying out of the dreaded sun.    </li>
      <li>I like the pump bottles for the Regenerist serums so much.</li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>
      <li>Very dissappointed being that this is a Oil of Olay product.</li>
      <li>The spots are really diminishing.</li>
      <li>it really does work.  </li>
      <li>Very dissapointed</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Brown spot is disappearing already. Product works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months.  I have noticed a lightening of dark patches in my T zone and on tops of cheek bones which I attribute to a combination of sun damage and &amp;#34;pregnancy mask&amp;#34;.  I can still see the spots in bright light so they are not completely gone but I&#x27;m not sure any cosmetic bought O T C could claim that.  I have used this religiously 2 times a day.</li>
    <li> Works over time, love the feel on my skin and no reactions on my very sensitive skin. Lasts a really long time. It&#x27;s a keeper. This is my third bottle in 2 years. Lasts a long time. It is a good treatment in place of lasers which I also did on the really dark spots. This keeps them from coming back.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t found that it made any appreciable difference in the spotty areas on my skin. I did not use it for as long as it required however, as I tend to have short patience with these things. I do expect to see SOMETHING, anything, as far as a change, within a couple of weeks of use. I gave up consistently using it after daily use for 2-3 weeks. Occasionally will put in on the area even now, mabe once or twice a week, sometimes more.I think I&#x27;ll give  it to my mon for her to try though bc it may have to do with the darkness of the spots being treated. Mine are faint to begin with.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in stubborn age spots, but it has a nice texture...maybe just not strong enough for older folks with darker age spots.</li>
    <li> I have spent two months, but did not see the effect in my face</li>
    <li> I developed some melasmas on my face (dark patches caused by a mix of sun and hormones) and have tried several department store skin products and this is the only one that seems to be fading the spots.  Plus, it&#x27;s half the cost.  Glad I found it, just wish I had tried it before dropping $$$ only the other pricier brands.  I use it once a day, twice if I remember, and within 3 weeks I saw noticeable fading.  I have sensitive skin and have had no irritation.</li>
    <li> I broke out from this product, red splotches all over my face</li>
    <li> this product brightens my skin but will continue using until the bottle finish did not see any result as Olay stated</li>
    <li> Just started to use it. So far so good. I like the texture and it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and have noticed no difference in the age spots on my hands and arms.  I do use a 50 spf sunblock along with it.  I&#x27;m not impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> Olay has gotten pricey but still cheaper that&#x27;s a lot of other brands and this definitely works.  Dark spots start to fade fast.</li>
    <li> The skin product helps your skin stay smooth to the touch but it did not fade my dark spots.  I would not recommend this product to anyone i know.</li>
    <li> I did not have unreasonable expectations, just the hope that age spots on my hands and face would lighten a little.  Well, believe me, that did not happen.  This was a total waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I tried this but don&#x27;t like the texture, and don&#x27;t think there is any visible difference .</li>
    <li> No improvements yet to remove spot.  Wife has been using this product since December.</li>
    <li> I will buy it again~！</li>
    <li> fine!My wife like it!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything!!!!!  This is the first thing that has worked!!!!!</li>
    <li> The price is lower than China</li>
    <li> I used the entire bottle and there has been no reduction in the skin spots.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It has toned down the pink blotches and lightened the sun spot over a four week process.  It&#x27;s a subtle slow process.  The light-weight serum glides on and is odorless.  I&#x27;ll keep using it as I like the entire correcting protocol. It has evened out my skin tone and moisturizes nicely.</li>
    <li> This thing is sooo good!! It completely does what it claims. I used it for a week every night without forgetting in those spots where I had de-colored skin due to pimples and it totally work. Just make sure to use enough sunscreen in the morning not to affect the process.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement and the bottle is almost finished! Wish it didi!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t seem to do anything</li>
    <li> The product is actually deserving of 2.5 stars for me, but that isn&#x27;t an option so I am rounding up as I was taught to do. I purchased this last February based on the main claim from the maker: &amp;#34;Concentrated formula corrects and prevents hyper pigmentation while providing skin-nourishing hydration&amp;#34;.  I was primarily interested in the CORRECTS hyper pigmentation part of that claim because I was hoping to at least lighten some of the age spots that have begun to appear in the last couple of years.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle of them being erased, but for a product that retails at a figure close to $50 I did expect to be able to see some change.  Unfortunately, I can see absolutely no results at all.  There is no way for me to determine if the product prevented any additional spots so the claim of nourishing hydration is the only one I can verify.  Big deal- any product that contains water can make that claim and you can buy a quality moisturizer for much less.  A positive comment regarding this product is that by purchasing it here on Amazon is I only wasted half the money I would have had I paid the retail price.</li>
    <li> Not showing as the name of the product says &amp;#34;Even Skin Tone Spot Fading&amp;#34; whatsoever, but it feels good to my skin when applied.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful, very like</li>
    <li> This came in the time expected. I bought this for my wife she says it was OK but really wanted something more, now don&#x27;t get me wrong its probably a great product for many ladies out there ,but not for mine  ( whats with the shoe ?)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for only one week, morning and night as directed, and in conjunction with the brightening night cream, and day time sunscreen. After just 4 days I noticed my hyper pigmentation starting to fade! Nothing has worked to help this. I tried cliniques even better spot removal, and it did nothing. I use glycolic acid and it also did nothing. I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly this has started to work, and that I can see a noticible difference! I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using it to fade the hyper pigmentation as much as possible!</li>
    <li> Used for a month. Unfortunately, didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> I had a large sun damage spot on my forehead near my hair line. It just happened last summer and ever since the rest of the tan faded and left that splotchy spot about half an inch wide and one and half inches long on my forehead, it was the first thing I saw every time I looked into the mirror. I have been using this Olay product for about a week and a half, trying to remember two times a day. The spot has definitely faded but not disappeared. I no longer stare at it because it is far less noticeable. I am not sure if with continued use it will disappear but for now, I am satisfied with the fact that is no longer as dark as it was. I would suggest this product if you have sun spots but cannot speak to any other benefit. You only need to use a little dab twice each day and I work the lotion in completely to make sure it gets into my skin. This is an affordable option for those not looking for complete removal but fading of spots</li>
    <li> I bought this for a light brown spot that showed up on my face about 2-3 years ago.  With lots of research and decent reviews, I chose this.  I used it once daily (I only wash my face once a day) on the spot, but it really didn&#x27;t work on it; however, the saving grace for this product for me was that it helped with another problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, I started noticing small little bumps on my fingers that looked like little blisters.  After showing it to my boyfriend who has been dealing with mild eczema on his hands for most of his life, told me that it looked exactly like his and proceeded to show me.  I looked online and I guess this is something that occurs at any stage in your life no matter what the age.  So...I just dealt with it by ignoring it knowing that there is nothing I can do for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just over a year ago, this strange scab-like thing showed up on my face on the right side of my upper lip area, like where a Cindy Crawford mole would be, but just a tad closer to my nose.  It was a strange scab...just some slight redness and a clear scab and barely noticeable.  It would &amp;#34;flare up&amp;#34; every now and again where it was a tad bit more noticeable and sore to the touch.  I was never able to really identify what it was until recently...the eczema.  When I bought this product...approximately 8 months ago...I decided to do an experiment and try it on this weird scab thing on my face.  I noticed that it calmed down a bit and sometimes the scab would go away for a few days or so.  I knew it wasn&#x27;t healed, but it helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another experiment I stopped using it for several weeks to see what would happen.  The small scab thingy came back slowly to the sore and the more noticeable state again, so I started using it and got results even faster this time around with it down to barely anything at all in a matter of 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this may work for some on dark spots, but not for me.  But it did work on something else that I considered an inconvenience and that is why I have given it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I cannot see too much difference in my dark spots so far.  I feel that I have not used it long enough to rate it.  Mary Bruner</li>
    <li> Does nothing for me.  Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time that I been using Olay products,these products are amazing.I just hope with time and use my spots will fade away completely,for now I&#x27;lm happy and satiesfied with the results!!!</li>
    <li> Over the course of 1 year (I took breaks for my skin to rest in between the Pro X Even Skin tone spot corrector kits) I used three kits.  I&#x27;m in my early 30s and had a few pigmentation problems from having ultra fair skin. I have used sunscreen religiously since I was 20 but still can&#x27;t avoid all hyper-pigmentation problems. It did lighten the spots perhaps two shades but ultimately, they are still visible to others. I followed all of the instructions and read so many great reviews- but for my skin, it really didn&#x27;t do what I expected and didn&#x27;t perform as other reviewers praised. Taking into consideration different skin types yield different results, I understand. But: it is an expensive kit (if you buy the serum, sunscreen, and hydrating creme together) so for about $120, I didn&#x27;t see improvement. Bummed but I think Olay put out a fair attempt in the market for spot treatments.</li>
    <li> Actually I bought it for my friend. I don&#x27;t it if it very good, but since my friend require me to buy it, I guess it worth 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. Used for this product for over a month with little to NO results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really an amazing product, my skin turns soft and smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;but i didn&#x27;t see any lighter of my face</li>
    <li> I have not spent enough time with the product to give the actuall review. But it has not irritated my skin , so nothing bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most extraordinary skin products I&#x27;ve ever used! I have sun spots on my face from swimming an average of six hours a day for about 7 wonderful years when my family lived in a town with a nearby lake. I spent six hours a day on the water, either swimming, floating on a tube or raft or just lying on my friend&#x27;s raft, out in the middle of the lake, discussing the important events of our world.  Naturally, as we got older, those events changed but our venue didn&#x27;t. I knew nothing of spf&#x27;s in those ancient times. (I&#x27;m 65) Actually, I&#x27;m fortunate that I didn&#x27;t really like to lie in the sun or the damage would be worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Hydroquinolone for years, doing 3 months on and 3 months off, but the spots faded to a certain point and then stopped. Then I asked my doctor for an RX for Retinol.  That was horrible.  I did a spot test on the inside of my elbow. My arm got a little red but I thought it was no big deal, thus I literally burnt my neck.  Luckily, I didn&#x27;t try it on my face. I will always have a white circle, around a sun spot, on my neck, due to stupidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Olay Regenerist line and have used it since Prescriptives went out of business. Unfortunately, the Regenerist Luminous tone perfecting cream made me break out but lightened the sunspots. I noticed that this product used Niacinamide as its lightening agent, so I starting searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have to go far.  I went to the Olay web site and saw Pro-X Even Spot Fading treatment. This time I did a spot test and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all.  I started to use it and to my amazement, the spots started to lighten within 3 days of use.  My regimen is easy. After showering, I apply it to the spots first, and let in soak in and dry. Next I put on my Oil of Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting serum, the Oil of Olay product that I think has made the biggest change in my skin.  I follow by using their micro-sculpting cream.  I don&#x27;t put on anything else but lipstick if I&#x27;m just going to be home, otherwise I put on a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my husband was amazed! I made sure he looked at the spots before I started to use it so he could see any changes and after kind of muttering under his breath, he agreed. He was astounded at the change the Pro-X Even Spot Fading treatment had made. I&#x27;m happy to report that the spots continue to lighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I an not a believer in a product making an immediate change in my skin; I think it&#x27;s all hype. Thus, I was amazed at how much my sun spots faded in just 3 days use and how it continues to lighten the ugly spots. I thought the Regenerist line was my favorite but now I shall have to check out the Pro-X line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have even a few sun spots you&#x27;d like to remove, I recommend you start with this product so you won&#x27;t go through what I did. Oil of Olay Pro-X Even Spot Fading treatment is an amazing product, as are so many Oil of Olay products.going to be home, otherwise I put on a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my husband was amazed!

    <li> Did not see any results using this product. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I asked my doctor about a dark spot on my upper cheek one month ago.  He said it was sun damage and not anything to worry about...well, maybe not, but it was getting harder to disguise it with make-up.  I bought this and and I can&#x27;t believe how great it works.  That unsightly brownish spot the size of a dime is now so faded that it is almost invisible...Plus the texture of the area is now smooth!  Wow....I recommend this more than any other product I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> Definitely fades my facial dark spots. Awesome when a product actually works. No need to look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> I have used this product faithfully now for weeks now with no results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 8 weeks ans see little to no difference in the color of my spots.</li>
    <li> Well I purchased this at target im thinking for less then 6$. I checked targets websight and its much more expensive then on amazon. Well Im using it for my acne scars and so far it seems like its working. My spots are fading and Im not breaking out from this product either. My skin is extremely sensitive and so far so good.</li>
    <li> Not working. But it is good to use it as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any diminishment in my spots yet. Will likely go back to a different product. Will use until it&#x27;s finished and re- evaluate</li>
    <li> I have severe pigmentation and acne scarring and I still break out occasionally so I have both old and new scars. I noticed that this works very slowly. I did not see results overnight like some other reviewers here but I did eventually notice a slight improvement with the scars. It works better and faster on newer scars. My skin scars really easily and this helped fade those new scars rather quickly. the older scars took a little bit longer to lighten. I also noticed a slight improvement in overall skin tone. I apply this like lotion to my entire face after cleansing at night so maybe that is why. Directions said that it can be applied in the daytime as well but I am scared about sensitivity to the sun therefore I only apply at night. It could be that that is why my results were slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also thought that the product was a wee bit slimy. So that is also why I don&#x27;t like putting it on in the daytime. And it does not mix well with my daytime lotion which has sunscreen in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the reason for giving it only 4 stars is the packaging. I like the pump bottles for the Regenerist serums so much. This dropper style is very unhygienic and also results in a lot of wastage of the product. I understand that this is a little runny but I think it will work just as well or even better with a pump bottle. It feels very messy with the dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would buy this again and would recommend this. Although I don&#x27;t think results will be same for everyone. I saw slow but good improvement in my overall skin tone and newer scars and I am confident that with continued use, the older scars will lighten as well. Also, the product is rather long lasting considering how much I have spilled and dropped because of the dropper and the fact that I apply way more than 2 to 3 drops in every application.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best!  Nothing else quite as good.  So glad I found this!</li>
    <li> Just got it, so really too soon to know how well it will work.</li>
    <li> I just get used to this product.</li>
    <li> Huge difference in about three weeks.  No irritation, but I have been using Olay products for over 20 years.</li>
    <li> good. but i was allegic it.</li>
    <li> Heard that it&#x27;s a very good serum but couldn&#x27;t buy it locally.  It&#x27;s functioning so perfect while using it with the magical cleaning of Clarisonic.  The spots are really diminishing.</li>
    <li> This product broke me out it gave me a red rash all over my face, This was money wasted don&#x27;t buy this product if you have sensitive skin .</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  It might for someone else, but I would not purchase it again. Some things work for some and not for others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it morning and night everyday for an entire month and I saw absolutely no results. At least it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It was also moisturizing. But I didn&#x27;t see any fading of my spots. My search for a spot fading treatment continues...</li>
    <li> Save your money, this does not work.  It&#x27;s expensive.  Thought I would try it and sorry I spent the money.</li>
    <li> Used 4 weeks, no change.</li>
    <li> I found that pro-x did fade my dark spots .</li>
    <li> it does a little work.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to eradicate a hyper-pigmented area on my face that was caused by a doctor administered laser treatment. The doctor is board certified in both head and neck reconstructive surgery, and also as an ENT. I mention this to clarify that I didn&#x27;t go to a fly by night operation, nor did I have this mark when I went in to the doctor&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;The reviews on this product were split, it seemed that either it produced no results or fantastic results. The cost compared to what I have spent on products, both OTC and prescription, over the years to get rid of this horrible spot was minimal. I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing.  This is one of the only products, whether OTC or prescription strength, that has helped at all. It has reduced the pigmentation noticeably, but the spot is still there.  As an added bonus, this lotion (it&#x27;s thicker than a serum but not quite as thick as a true lotion would be) feels amazing on your face, and softens your skin. I will never be without this and will update this review in a few months to see where we are with the spot. This is for some reason very difficult to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every night for the past 2 months.  I massage it into my problem areas for 5 mins using my fingers OR 15 minutes using my Dermawand.  I can say that it has discolored around 40%.  The spots don&#x27;t look as brown and I see a blotch I have around my eyes (sunglasses burn) to start fading into little blotches.  Using the Dermawand really penetrates the product and I can see a major difference versus using my fingers.  A bit pricey but it is a lot of product.  I still 1/4 left - 2 months, nightly PM use.</li>
    <li> not sure is it affect.i am just ust it everyday any night</li>
    <li> While it didn&#x27;t do anything to my dark spots, so I won&#x27;t buy it again, it absorbs well, it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell and it doesn&#x27;t make my very oily skin more oily. This is not the most horrible serum I&#x27;ve tried, so it actually doesn&#x27;t deserve only one star. But having done nothing at all, it doesn&#x27;t deserve more stars either.</li>
    <li> For those who use Olay Pro X Spot Fading BE VERY CAREFUL! It left huge white spots on my face. I been fighting it for MONTHS and nothing seem to make them disappear. I complained many times with the company and all they did is send me some coupons to buy the same stupid product, when all I wanted was to them to let me know how I should proceed to make these spots disappear. After the second e-mail they stopped replying. SO DISAPPOINTING OLAY!</li>
    <li> this is the absolute best spot fading treatment- it really does work.  this is my second bottle; I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3-4 weeks and have seen very little spot removal. I will use it till its finish but I don&#x27;t think its going to work</li>
    <li> This product did a pretty good job at getting rid of my dark spots. However, they are not completely gone. I love the packaging of this product. I love how the product is dispensed. The product itself is liquid as a serum. Does not have a funky smell. Goes on nicely onto the skin. Going to give it another chance...</li>
    <li> Definitely helps with lightening dark spots....but you have to be consistent and use every day till the product is gone. 2nd bottle is where you see amazing results.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t been using long enough to tell if it works or not.</li>
    <li> I get bad break outs from time to time, which leaves my face with alot of dark spots. So I was looking for something that would fade my dark spots without being to harsh on my skin. This Olay proffessional Pro-X Even Skin Tone Spot Fading Treatment, worked great on my skin with out me having any kind of irritation. A little bit of this product does the trick and the smell isn&#x27;t overbearing. I have been using this for 2 weeks now and my spots are fading. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out at all with this fading treatment serum. I used this on my face 2 times a day, in the morning and in the night. You only need to used 2  to 3 drops on your face. I recommend this product to anybody who has spots that to be faded.</li>
    <li> I used to use Olay green bottle,well in china it costs at least 200rmb.But this pro-x one is much more effective and much cheaper at the same time.I  like it and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> used for 1 month, doesn&#x27;t work....</li>
    <li> Bought this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation that this worked to even her skin tone,but unfortunately after using everyday &amp; night for past couple months,no improvement in mine!! Had high hopes on oil of Olay product.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I have always loved Olay products, and are very loyal to them because they always meet their claims and my expectations. After one nights use my blemish marks were already lighter.</li>
    <li> I like it but pls do not separate my order to several parts!!tks!!</li>
    <li> Here we are today in February of 2017... I&#x27;m checking back in as promised. Still using this product and I love it. Melisma much improved, but I&#x27;m telling you that I use this everyday all over my face after washing with ProX cleanser and follow up with Regenerist regenerating Fragrance Free serum and Total Effects 7 sensitive skin moisturizer. I work asa flight attendant and women in their 20&#x27;s, 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s regularly compliment me on my skin and ask my skin care regime. This is a great product (all that I have mentioned) and I will continue to use. Not cheap but a way cheaper alternative to department store brands and dermatologist brands and I have tried most of them. Frangrabce free is key as well as consist use and staying out of the dreaded sun.    This was my original post from 2015: As a loyal and satisfied user of Olay Pro-X, Olay Regenerist, and Olay Total Effects 7, I was hopeful about this product. I am in my early 50&#x27;s. People are always very surprised when I tell them my age, most say 10-15 years younger, but I&#x27;ve always taken excellent care of my skin. No sun ever -- always used eye cream (since age 13) and am somewhat obsessive if you haven&#x27;t alreay noticed, lol.  Overall, my skin condition is very good, but I have been struggling with melasma patches on both cheeks and it was also starting to show up on my forehead. That being said I knew I had to dedicate myself to a treatment solution instead of just covering up with concealer.  I have been using this all over my face -- not just spot treating. After doing some research on melasma online, most skin experts suggest treating the entire face when it comes to uneven pigment problems.  So far my skin looks great. This has a lot of good ingredients regardless of discoloration issues. I know improvement takes time, so I signed up for auto ship and will check back later with another review.  I am also using a glycolic skin cleanser at least 4 times a week (alternating with gentle hydrating cleanser) followthis with a good moisturizer and eye cream and sunscreen daily. Also a night time retinol regime.  Keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed and saw no change at all in regards to lightening the spots created by exposure to the sun. Very dissappointed being that this is a Oil of Olay product. Also have you noticed that they have so many products for the same ailment? I like Oil of Olay, but it is very difficult to navigate around and figure what product you need for a particular or a general issue.Very dissapointed</li>
    <li> nice ,but i didnot see the result.maybe i need time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for well over 4 weeks and have noticed only a very faint improvement in the dark spots I have on my face and neck.  I will finish the bottle but will not purchase again.  Save your money and look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I do not see any changes in my skin after using it for about a month.  I am disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for my age spots for 2 months- I notice a big decrease in the color as it FADES like it states. It is not going to completely erase the spots- come on GIRLS stay out of the SUN if you want miracles!</li>
