### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!!</li>
      <li>This foundation is the best in my opinion.</li>
      <li>i am very fair skinned</li>
      <li>Best cosmetic line that I&#x27;ve used -- and to be fair I&#x27;ve tried it call.  </li>
      <li>the consistency and coverage is great.</li>
      <li>I just bought this cream and it is fantastic!!!</li>
      <li>However, I am fair skinned</li>
      <li>Also the light is perfect match for light/medium skin</li>
      <li>this is probably a good product.</li>
      <li>I tried this CC on a whim and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m amazed how good this CC cream is.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fair and was hoping the light would work.</li>
      <li>It went on very smoothly and easily and my skin looks flawless!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just perfect, not too dry and chalky, not too greasy, just awesome!</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;d be in love if a lighter shade was created!</li>
      <li>Oh and I love that it has SPF 30!</li>
      <li>I top it with the CC powder to give it a nice finsh.</li>
      <li>This goes on very smoothly and is lightweight.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and doesn&#x27;t make my skin any more oily.</li>
      <li>I stumbled upon Physician&#x27;s Formula cosmetics and I have to say I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Most drugstore makeup is, so it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.</li>
      <li>That on top of it being a safe sunscreen make it a 10/10 for me.</li>
      <li>Living Physician Formula products, plan to buy &amp; try more of this product.more.</li>
      <li>Looks better on my skin than makeup does and applies better/quicker than makeup</li>
      <li>It somehow ended up popping the cream out the top seam and all onto the inside of the box.</li>
      <li>Seems like an ok product.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>With additional blending I look pretty good.</li>
      <li>I guess if it was the right color I would have liked it more.</li>
      <li>But I ordered light and the light is more like medium.</li>
      <li>but that light was too light on my skin.</li>
      <li>I have no idea who thinks this is a light color.</li>
      <li>So smooth and lite this product is on my skin</li>
      <li>This color was too light.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel like you are wearing anything.</li>
      <li>I feel it has a light to medium coverage.</li>
      <li>Pretty sure this broke me out.  </li>
      <li>I bought it first at CVS, loved it,  and went to buy more later on.</li>
      <li>I am blonde with pretty fair skin and the color works for me when blended correctly.  </li>
      <li>So maybe those who liked the cream but felt the light shade was too dark, I&#x27;d suggest trying the light in the CC organic one.</li>
      <li>I did not return it as I did not feel it was worth my time</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on this compared to foundation, but it provides a nice blending and makes my skin overall look good)&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>lil dark of you are fair skined.</li>
      <li>Does have some tint, and looks pretty good, but not worth it.</li>
      <li>I actually bought the CC organic cream when I was waiting on the light shade to be available at CVS</li>
      <li>I love the spf in it and that it uses only titanium dioxide and zinc oxide for sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>This was my first time trying a CC cream.</li>
      <li>Overall, I love this product.</li>
      <li>I am 37 years old with fair skin (on the dry side) and reddening on my cheeks and nose.</li>
      <li>I put my powder on top of it and it really takes my skin to the next level.</li>
      <li>It is so easy going on and actually has improved my complexion.</li>
      <li>I love the coverage but light is still a little darker than normal.</li>
      <li>One review said it was &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; but I really was not.</li>
      <li>But I really want to.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend giving this product a try!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just beyond amazed how good it covered up my blemishes, dark circles and red spots on my face.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this multiple times but finally got an Amazon to see if I could get it cheaper, as I always seem to run out at the most inopportune times</li>
      <li>It does a decent job of covering up discoloration from acne.  </li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t normally wear make-up</li>
      <li>I found it a little too heavy for my tastes, but great as an in between all out foundation and tinted moisturizer.</li>
      <li>people complain about the light still being too dark for their skin</li>
      <li>It looks pretty dark in the tube, but blends into the skin very well.</li>
      <li>(Since I haven&#x27;t found anything else so far, I also use this as my surf sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>VERY orange and smells a little funny.</li>
      <li>It was in its original box then inside a small shipping box.</li>
      <li>There inventory must be off because they have an abundance of the other shades but not Light ..for too many weeks.</li>
      <li>There is a small piece of cardboard in the smaller box that intersects perpendicularly with the top flat seam of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I finally found one in BurnOut, but apparently they changed the formula</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a little dark for a &#x27;light&#x27;.  </li>

<li> as other people have stated, this is a little too dark for me.</li>
<li> I use light/ medium in other makeup lines but for this, I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the color was a little lighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> a little pricey&lt;br /&gt;Rubs</li>
<li> so maybe it&#x27;s not great compared to regular foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> (silver tube with green writing)</li>
<li> Waste of money for me.</li>
<li> Made me look a bit pale.</li>
<li> Not sure if I can return after opening.</li>
<li> am in my late 30&#x27;s with combination skin.  </li>
<li> And other creams I&#x27;ve used in the past have left the pores on my nose visible, which I hate... not this one!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the coverage but light is still a little darker than normal.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Works for my skin well. It hides the pores. I bought it first at CVS, loved it,  and went to buy more later on. There inventory must be off because they have an abundance of the other shades but not Light ..for too many weeks. So I decided to try amazon and it shipped here as promised on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain about the light still being too dark for their skin but I like this shade on mine. I actually bought the CC organic cream when I was waiting on the light shade to be available at CVS but that light was too light on my skin. So maybe those who liked the cream but felt the light shade was too dark, I&#x27;d suggest trying the light in the CC organic one. (silver tube with green writing)</li>
    <li> This color was too light.  Made me look a bit pale.</li>
    <li> .  I have no idea who thinks this is a light color. I also do not know anyone with this skin color.  It&#x27;s like burnt orange paint.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this multiple times but finally got an Amazon to see if I could get it cheaper, as I always seem to run out at the most inopportune times (ie when it&#x27;s $15 and not on sale anywhere).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me begin by saying my skin hates EVERYTHING.  I live in Florida and surf so a sunscreen is absolutely necessary but unfortunately finding one that wouldn&#x27;t break me out was a big problem.  I finally found one in BurnOut, but apparently they changed the formula so I have not repurchased (I went off reviews for that decision; not worth my money if others had problems with the new stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the hunt began again.  My requirements were: no animal testing, physical sunscreen that I can wear daily, including to work (ie no white face).  I started with the PF Organic CC cream but it left me too greasy.  I tried this CC on a whim and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Physical Sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;NO BREAKOUTS&lt;br /&gt;Good coverage (I don&#x27;t normally wear make-up so I can&#x27;t comment on this compared to foundation, but it provides a nice blending and makes my skin overall look good)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to blend&lt;br /&gt;Good sun protection (Since I haven&#x27;t found anything else so far, I also use this as my surf sunscreen.  It stays on well enough to protect my face, including on trips to Central America)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I feel it&#x27;s a little pricey&lt;br /&gt;Rubs off...water doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue but this gets all over the collar of my white lab coat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to repurchase until they change the formula.  Some people have commented on the color.  I am blonde with pretty fair skin and the color works for me when blended correctly.  But again, I&#x27;m not a normal make-up wearer so maybe it&#x27;s not great compared to regular foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best price found on amazon and wal mart.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is so easy going on and actually has improved my complexion. Living Physician Formula products, plan to buy &amp; try more of this product.more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too dark for my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed how good this CC cream is. So smooth and lite this product is on my skin feels like nothing is even on my face. I top it with the CC powder to give it a nice finsh. I&#x27;m just beyond amazed how good it covered up my blemishes, dark circles and red spots on my face. I highly recommend giving this product a try! Also the light is perfect match for light/medium skin lil dark of you are fair skined.</li>
    <li> I like the product but did not like how it arrived. It was in its original box then inside a small shipping box. There is a small piece of cardboard in the smaller box that intersects perpendicularly with the top flat seam of the bottle. It somehow ended up popping the cream out the top seam and all onto the inside of the box. I did not return it as I did not feel it was worth my time/effort and there was still cream in the bottle I could use. I just duct taped it at the seam.</li>
    <li> Overall, I love this product. I feel it has a light to medium coverage. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel like you are wearing anything. It&#x27;s hydrating. Has a satin finish, I&#x27;d say. Looks better on my skin than makeup does and applies better/quicker than makeup does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; was even lighter. It looks pretty dark in the tube, but blends into the skin very well. However, I am fair skinned and it&#x27;s still too dark for me. Most drugstore makeup is, so it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me. But I&#x27;d be in love if a lighter shade was created!</li>
    <li> I am 37 years old with fair skin (on the dry side) and reddening on my cheeks and nose. I just bought this cream and it is fantastic!!! It went on very smoothly and easily and my skin looks flawless!! No visible redness AT ALL! And other creams I&#x27;ve used in the past have left the pores on my nose visible, which I hate... not this one! It&#x27;s just perfect, not too dry and chalky, not too greasy, just awesome! You would never know I have any issues with my skin! My skin definitely looks 10 years younger. I&#x27;m HOOKED!! Oh and I love that it has SPF 30!</li>
    <li> I have never been a foundation person, just wear mineral powders. This is now an essential in daily routine. I put my powder on top of it and it really takes my skin to the next level. I have acne and combination skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and doesn&#x27;t make my skin any more oily. It has a satin finish for a dewy look. That on top of it being a safe sunscreen make it a 10/10 for me.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon Physician&#x27;s Formula cosmetics and I have to say I&#x27;m glad I did.  Best cosmetic line that I&#x27;ve used -- and to be fair I&#x27;ve tried it call.  This foundation is the best in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this broke me out.  Does have some tint, and looks pretty good, but not worth it.</li>
    <li> VERY orange and smells a little funny. Doesn&#x27;t adjust to your skin color like it should at all.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying a CC cream. Moving from tinted moisturizer. I found it a little too heavy for my tastes, but great as an in between all out foundation and tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Seems like an ok product. I guess if it was the right color I would have liked it more. But I ordered light and the light is more like medium. I&#x27;m very fair and was hoping the light would work. One review said it was &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; but I really was not. I have dry skin from using proactive and hoped it would take place of moisturizer and primer. I guess I still need to do both. Not sure if I can return after opening. But I really want to. If you have darker skin and oily skin this is probably a good product. Waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> as other people have stated, this is a little too dark for me. i don&#x27;t think i would consider this &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;. i am very fair skinned so it is a little harder to find something that matches. blends well on the skin. the consistency and coverage is great. just wish it would come in a lighter shade.</li>
    <li> C++ color correction evenly covered my face. With additional blending I look pretty good.</li>
    <li> Pros:  This goes on very smoothly and is lightweight.  I love the spf in it and that it uses only titanium dioxide and zinc oxide for sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  it&#x27;s a little dark for a &#x27;light&#x27;.  I use light/ medium in other makeup lines but for this, I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the color was a little lighter.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late 30&#x27;s with combination skin.  It does a decent job of covering up discoloration from acne.  It does not make my forehead look oily.  But it&#x27;s not moisturizing for my dry areas.</li>
