    <li> I have sever dry skin and I really has my figures crossed with this product. Unfortunately,  it didn&#x27;t do what the product said it would do and the smell is not pleasant at all. What a waste, but this brand shampoo is great !! That&#x27;s the one product I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I have very sensitive skin--allergies and eczema.  I use it on my face and body.  It keeps my skin moisturized without feeling greasy.  I think it has helped improve the fine lines and wrinkles on my face.  I just bought another jar.  I will never let myself run out.</li>
    <li> Good quality item; fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using this for over 3 years now and love it. I use it as an all over moisturizer. It&#x27;s great for chapped or windburned lips, any dry skin, cracked heels, and sunburns, too. My sister uses it and now my husband uses it. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the shampoo, conditioner and moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve only been using the products for a few days.......but I just LOVE them.  The shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel so clean, soft, natural and manageable.  I really like the fact that  the products are natural and that there are no detergents or chemicals in the products.    The one thing I had to adjust  to ...... I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of the shampoo to wash my hair.  Other products have detergent in them and consequently they produce a lot of &#x27;suds&#x27;.....there really aren&#x27;t &#x27;suds&#x27; with this product.....but, that doesn&#x27;t mean the product isn&#x27;t cleaning my hair !!!  It is......I can see that by the results.  My order was received very quickly.....there was an issue with the packing but the vendor resolved it right away.  Prior to receiving the order the vendor sent me an &#x27;information&#x27; e-mail about the products and how to use them.  Overall, I&#x27;m extremely impressed with the vendor&#x27;s service and the products.</li>
    <li> its soft, no crazy order</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the cream.  About 10 min after application my skin had severe itch.  I attempted to obtain information from the company.  No response.</li>
    <li> The most moisturizing creme I&#x27;ve ever used!!! From now this one the first &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; thing in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> This is for sure a skin treat!  It is the best moisturizer I have ever used... soothes my skin.</li>
    <li> nice natural product, not greasy and easily absorbed</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Good on Ya&amp;#34; is phenomenal. My skin feels better after only three days of using the creme. I have very sensitive dry skin and have tried many products with no success. Additionally it doesn&#x27;t have fragrance or chemicals, which I very much appreciate. I have even tried natural products that had a very peculiar smell to them, Good on Ya doesn&#x27;t. It just feels and smells good.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Well it really helped the dry itchy spots I was getting on my face.. and had a few freinds say I don&#x27;t look as wrinkled...lol however one might take that. But all in all I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is truly an amazing product I am going to buy the facial cleanser next. We did not want to buy the facial cleanser until I saw the results in the cream first and yes we saw the results within a few weeks. I threw away my other products and will continue to use these products. Yes folks this stuff really works well !!! I had facial dark marks with oily skin now it cleared up very nicely. All I can say try it and you will see positive results. God Bless the company that makes this cream and facial wash. Keep manufacturing this product it is a Blessing greatly appreciated !!!</li>
    <li> For some reason this burns my skin when I apply it.  I do have sensitive skin but not that sensitive.  Update!  Just purchased Honeyskin Moisturizer and I cannot recommend it highly enough.  I would never recommend Good On Ya,  However I would urge anyone with difficult skin to get the Honeyskin Product ASAP</li>
    <li> Seems good so far but need to use it for a month or so to see the true benefit.  I did buy the cleanser as you should only use this type of product on your skin if you want it to do what it says.</li>
    <li> I just got this product yesterday and started applying it on my arms, legs and feet. It is not oily. It is concentrated so a small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  I&#x27;m not sure how it does on wrinkles though. You don&#x27;t have to use much and it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  Another customer commented on the smell.  The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but it isn&#x27;t bad.  You can only smell it when you first apply it for a few seconds.  Moisturizes well. It is supposed to be a natural product so I didn&#x27;t expect perfumes etc. to be added.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Both moisturizes and treats acne.  Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Wow! I Was Very Apprehensive... But, This Stuff Is Awesome! I Can&#x27;t Say Enough In Words To Describe The Results This Cream Gives... Soft, For Sure! One Of The BEST Without A Doubt! Expensive, But Worth It!</li>
    <li> Look very cheap but trust me works</li>
    <li> This stuff is like crack for my skin addictive !! I am currently in Afghanistan were the water will dry u out and this stuff has kept my skin smooth and soft.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Smells like glue! It didn&#x27;t work at all! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all. I shipped it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Horrible waxy like junk it went right in the trash.....  I trashed it mainly because I knew it would be a nightmare trying to return for refund. Shampoo is the only product worth using</li>
    <li> Wow!!! I opened the jar and put it on my hands . Which were very dry. What a difference it made on my skin.. I think I am going to love this .. Thank you for making a great product.. I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference on my face.. Very happy.</li>
    <li> OMG I will never use anything else, this product is phenomenal and I am glad I bought 2 !!! I very little goes a long way and it does what they say it does!!!</li>
    <li> Is good and working I loved</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Leaves your face very moisturized. It does not break me out, and it lasts a long time. Im on my second bottle an will continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes face kinda tingle and very good moisturizer absorbs into skin quickly not greasy at all.  Still left wondering what is really in it because list of ingredients so small no one can read it.  They need to list clearly all ingredients.. That&#x27;s a little fishy.  Otherwise love product.</li>
    <li> Seems to clog my pores.</li>
    <li> I have been using Good on Ya Products for almost 2 years and I have seen a difference in my skin.  There are less wrinkles, smoother skin and tighter pores.  It helped me get through a poisen ivy situation better than the prescription cream.  When I had to have a skin mole removed I was amazed to have no scar having used the Skin Treatment after the procedure.  I purchase the large size of all products.</li>
    <li> Received and used it almost on arrival and what a great feeling. Wish I had ordered the largest size because I will want this not only on my face and throat, but all over for exceptional moisture with many added benefits. The price quickly becomes a faded memory because this is an experience so worth it!</li>
    <li> I did not care for this product as much as HoneyGirl facial moisturizer, which I found to be more effective.</li>
    <li> Returned. Not as &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; as they said.</li>
    <li> Excellent - not at all greasy, my face is loving it and my redness and occasional acne are disappearing.</li>
    <li> Totally recommend this! And I have one of those silly stories to share:  I have unintentionally damaged my under-eye area by putting retinol cream that burned and wrinkled my skin. It was so dry that nothing helped and I have tried every anti-wrinkle eye cream there is, nothing worked. A friend gave me to try a sample of this cream and my skin seem to have inhaled it, it got soaked in. That area has recovered now after using the cream for 6 months, and under no condition will I ever again use anything that has retinol in it. I have learned my lesson. I&#x27;ve also paid a full price for this cream and it is very expensive; but it is amazing what kind of deals you can get on Amazon sometimes. So be on lookout for discounts.  However, since the cream helped, I do not feel so bad for paying full price. This jar can last me two years; it is very moisturizing, but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I had very dry and bumpy skin. Not like tons of acne but just really not very healthy. I started  using this cream and have noticed a huge difference. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker. But I only use very little. I&#x27;m happy and pleased.</li>
    <li> This stuff is lovely! Been using it for a while now and it is making my skin so much softer and beautiful! Definitely want to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. This company makes several creams with Manuka honey and I&#x27;ve tried them all. This is the one I like the most for its texture and that it moisturizes while being completely non-greasy. It just sinks into your skin. I still have hormonal pimples once a month while using this cream, but I doubt anything over the counter will eliminate that problem.This cream is a good value at about $6.25 an ounce.</li>
    <li> Threw it away, smelled like it had gone rancid and my husband hated that smell..</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I tried it on my hand, it didn&#x27;t feel nice and smelled a little like glue</li>
    <li> Great for the sensitive and dry skin!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> This product does help to keep my skin from feeling dry. I only gave it four stars because it has little lumps init but they do smooth out!! Not a bad product!!</li>
    <li> I love the texture and how it feels on my face. I would recommend trying it. It feels refreshing.I like all the natural ingredients. I notice an improvement already in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year, and have satisfied with it. The reason for the 3 rating is that I ordered the buy one, get one, an I evidently did not read the fine print that showed that I was getting the small 3 oz and not the regular 8 oz size, I sent the owner a message to say I was disappointed and he did reply to say the price for that size was $60. ......?????</li>
    <li> smells weird when you first apply it but it quickly disappears and i love how it absorbs into your skin it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel that&#x27;s what i like the most about this and ive been using it for awhile and my eyes seem less wrinkled from the lake of sleep ive been going thru with a newborn.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Finally a cream this does not leave an oily residue! I used it on my face and hands and within a few days I noticed my craggy cuticles ; (I do a lot of scrubbing), were looking almost as normal as most women&#x27;s! Very nice! I now carry a little vial in my purse and have tossed out the liquid hand cream I had been using which lasted only a couple of minutes on my callused hands. There is no perfume scent which would make my allergies act up which is an additional plus point to this product!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! Use it for my whole family, from everything as a daily mousturizer to a medicinal cream on my daughters scar from a burn. Highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Will be buying this product again.</li>
