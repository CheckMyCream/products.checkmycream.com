      <li>Even my dentist compliment on my clean teeth.</li>
      <li>You can tell a good idea by how obvious is seems.</li>
      <li>While we were trying to find these flossers again, she used the disposable ones which are okay, but the angle and handle on these are much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying this in stock for me to be able to buy.</li>
      <li>I have used these for a few years with good results, because they are so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>They are much easier to use than traditional string floss, and you can use each floss end for weeks if you don&#x27;t break it, just give it a good rinse like your toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Easy to reach the back teeth and its easy to switch heads.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Turns out she&#x27;s right.</li>
      <li>I broke 2 of them right off the bat.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve only been able to find the flosser refills locally, so I was thrilled to find a 3 pack of the handles with refills on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would strongly recommend it for those who are, like me, challenged to floss well using more conventional methods.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find these on Amazon as they are hard to find in the drugstores, let alone finding the refill cartridges.</li>
      <li>I am able to get to the back of my mouth to floss with ease.  </li>
      <li>I like them better then any similar products I have tried.  </li>
      <li>These are soooo much more convenient than standard floss or even the pick flossers.  </li>
      <li>The handle fits will in the hand, the interchangeable heads are a good idea and hold firmly.  </li>
      <li>These are the best and I was having a hard time finding them at our local Walgreens.</li>
      <li>Easy for me to use and get all the way in the back</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t find the right holder and refills at my local super market.</li>
      <li>Suddenly they were no longer available at any of the stores here</li>
      <li>These really help encourage children to floss</li>
      <li>but you can&#x27;t really get the control</li>
      <li>Make flossing much easier</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this flosser at the local walmart store.  </li>
      <li>this tool makes it so easy that, while not &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; in the classical sense, the health benefits far out weigh any objection a sane person could come up with.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You just click out the head and replace with a new one as needed.</li>
      <li>Reach now says Lieterene but exactly the same device.  </li>
      <li>With this incredible little thing, I floss daily, if not more.</li>
      <li>I had a minor panic when my local stores stopped selling refills, just bought about 1 1/2 years worth from Amazon.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use which is why we started our daughter with one of these when she was little, and now it&#x27;s the only way she likes to floss.</li>
      <li>Great item impossible to find in retail stores anymore.  </li>
      <li>only negative would be that these cost more than just using floss.</li>
      <li>The stores no longer carry them and they are so much easier to use than loose floss.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, each head will last for several flosses if you take even a little care of them.  </li>
      <li>I usually get them at WM but they have not been available for several months.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is their relatively high price for such a simple device!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The only way i floss, i wish they had these when i was a kid. Easy to use, each head will last for several flosses if you take even a little care of them.  I rinse them after each use and dunk them in some listerine and i can get 2 weeks or so out of one head.  Beats the hell out of using regular floss.</li>
    <li> These really help encourage children to floss and they save a lot of time for adults as well!</li>
    <li> I never used to floss; maybe once every 3-4 weeks, but always grudgingly. My hands are too big for my mouth. With this incredible little thing, I floss daily, if not more. It&#x27;s become as indispensable in my travel kit as my mouthwash or cotton swabs. I had a minor panic when my local stores stopped selling refills, just bought about 1 1/2 years worth from Amazon. I hope they never stop making these. You can tell a good idea by how obvious is seems. After using this, I&#x27;m not sure why no one thought of it sooner.</li>
    <li> My teeth is not very good. Reach Access Flosser is my big help. Very useful</li>
    <li> These are the best and I was having a hard time finding them at our local Walgreens.</li>
    <li> I am one of those that has to floss their teeth every day.  However during the majority of the year my fingers are cracked and sore.  This works GREAT when I can&#x27;t use my regular floss.  The string on this is strong.  The tip snaps in and out easy.</li>
    <li> Love these flossers. They are easy to work with and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the string cutting off your finger circulation...</li>
    <li> Keep these in stock--they are great.</li>
    <li> The handle fits will in the hand, the interchangeable heads are a good idea and hold firmly.  The floss itself is a bit too big for my teeth, I find that only the &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34; style of floss works well so hence the 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was hoping for</li>
    <li> I have used these for years so my review will be brief.  I like them better then any similar products I have tried.  I am able to get to the back of my mouth to floss with ease.  I have nothing but good comments relating to this product.  The floss easily snaps on and off when you put a fresh one on.</li>
    <li> I love this item! I&#x27;m an incomplete quadriplegic and unable to floss without a tool like this.</li>
    <li> unable to find locally after dental office had suggested the use</li>
    <li> Not as awesome as I hoped.  I broke 2 of them right off the bat.</li>
    <li> I have used these for a few years with good results, because they are so easy to use.  The only drawback is their relatively high price for such a simple device!</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the thing: I ordered these, thinking to myself, &amp;#34;See? I&#x27;m growing up. I&#x27;m going to start flossing.&amp;#34; and I did... then when I proudly answered my dentist that yes, I was flossing with &amp;#34;one of those toothbrush flosser things&amp;#34;, she looked sideways at me and said, &amp;#34;Well... that&#x27;s better than nothing... those things are good for beginners... or children... but you can&#x27;t really get the control you need.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out she&#x27;s right. She gave me some regular floss and showed me how you&#x27;re supposed to do it (there&#x27;s more than just getting in between your teeth, you&#x27;ve gotta scrape up the sides as well, like a C around your tooth. Whaddayaknow.) I tried to do that with these and they just don&#x27;t cut it. Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No fault of the product though, they&#x27;ve been great. They just don&#x27;t do the job they&#x27;re for quite as well as floss does. But, if it means the difference between flossing and not, get these.</li>
    <li> These flossers are great.  They are much easier to use than traditional string floss, and you can use each floss end for weeks if you don&#x27;t break it, just give it a good rinse like your toothbrush.  What I like most is you don&#x27;t have to put your fingers in your mouth to floss; a healthier choice with viruses and bacteria.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find these on Amazon as they are hard to find in the drugstores, let alone finding the refill cartridges. I also found the refill cartridges here as well. The work great on my teeth where toothpicks and brushes just won&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> Product was just as advertised and I actually received it one day earlier than stated.  This was even better because it arrived the day before we went on vacation!</li>
    <li> These Reach flosses are my favorite and work the best for me. I usually get them at WM but they have not been available for several months. I found them at Amazon and got them in a multi order within 3 days by USPS w/o Prime. No tax or shipping charges.</li>
    <li> I have looked at all Pharmacies, grocery stores, and everywhere locally trying to find the Reach Access Flosser, and no one in the area has it, they just have the floss for it.  Thanks for carrying this in stock for me to be able to buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this via amazon.com because I can&#x27;t seem to find this at the stores any longer. This is one of the best product on the market that really helps with flossing your teeth.</li>
    <li> great flosser. easy to use.</li>
    <li> So glad to have found these. The stores no longer carry them and they are so much easier to use than loose floss.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years.</li>
    <li> These are great for flossing if you don&#x27;t like to use regular floss. Easy to reach the back teeth and its easy to switch heads.</li>
    <li> For someone with fine motor control impairment, like me, a floss holder is necessary, and these are the best on the market.  My only beef with the item is that changing the heads is a challenge.</li>
    <li> Great for flossing.  A lot better than trying to put your fingers in your mouth.</li>
    <li> looks old fashioned and outdated...</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this flosser at the local walmart store.  I bought one for my grandson also who was having dental problems.  This flosser is easier to use than other methods and you can reach all teeth.  The flosser encouraged him to floss more and I was also very pleased with it.  I have since purchased one of these for each family member.  Suddenly they were no longer available at any of the stores here so I ordered them.  We are all very pleased with this flosser.  They are great. Even though I can not find them in the store I know where to order them from.</li>
    <li> A fine product.  I would strongly recommend it for those who are, like me, challenged to floss well using more conventional methods.</li>
    <li> The greatest device since the electric toothbrush.  Reach now says Lieterene but exactly the same device.  If you have never used a flosser with a handle give this a try.</li>
    <li> I love this flosser. I had trouble using regular dental floss. Now with the Reach Flosser, I can floss everyday. Even my dentist compliment on my clean teeth.</li>
    <li> Great item impossible to find in retail stores anymore.  Keeps me from tearing corners of mouth trying to reach back teeth with regular flossingb and getting subsequent cold sores!</li>
    <li> good price excellent seller</li>
    <li> This works better than those little plastic flossers but it isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the Hummingbird that isn&#x27;t made any more. Something about the floss in this kind of hurts my gums. The handle is great, wish the floss was better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give Zero-stars if that was an option. this product is unsafe and very hard to use as well, each time I use this thing it  makes my gum bleed, the floss string is not waxed so it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get it through tight gaps between my teeth. I wasted 19 bucks to get that piece of junk!</li>
    <li> These are soooo much more convenient than standard floss or even the pick flossers.  I keep one in the car, one at the office and one beside my chair at home.  I can floss while driving or watching TV - you don&#x27;t need a mirror and you can floss using just one hand.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing, and having to gag myself with my fingers to get the job done made it not happen. this tool makes it so easy that, while not &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; in the classical sense, the health benefits far out weigh any objection a sane person could come up with. I have had one co these for a number of years now and I found this three pak to share with my family.&lt;br /&gt;Preferred Mart fulfilled my order in a timely and well packaged fashion.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these every day. I purchased this through Amazon because Johnson and Johnson keeps changing the design of these and I can&#x27;t find the right holder and refills at my local super market. But if you can find the right replacement floss, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> We have used the Reach Access Flosser for many years, however, we were unable to find it recently at any of our local outlets.  We were very happy to see we could order it in bulk so that we don&#x27;t run out! I know we will be ordering more! Thank you!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using these flossers for years, but during our last move, the flossers were lost. We&#x27;ve only been able to find the flosser refills locally, so I was thrilled to find a 3 pack of the handles with refills on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These flossers make getting to those hard to reach back teeth easy even in a small mouth. They are easy to use which is why we started our daughter with one of these when she was little, and now it&#x27;s the only way she likes to floss. While we were trying to find these flossers again, she used the disposable ones which are okay, but the angle and handle on these are much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just click out the head and replace with a new one as needed. You don&#x27;t have to worry about threading the floss as everything is already done for you. It always has the perfect tension to get the job done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative would be that these cost more than just using floss.</li>
    <li> This was purchase as a replacement. Product is good and I like it. Easy for me to use and get all the way in the back</li>
    <li> Love this tool&lt;br /&gt;Gets into hard to reach spots</li>
    <li> They work great. They&#x27;ve encouraged me to start flossing every day now because it took a 10-minute job and sore fingers and turned it into a very simple 2 minute process. The string seems to be very nice quality, I&#x27;ve already flossed 5 times using it and it hasn&#x27;t frayed one bit. It is superior to the disposable counterparts.</li>
    <li> Make flossing much easier</li>
</ol>
