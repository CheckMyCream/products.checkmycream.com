      <li>I searched for this model and thrilled to find it still available...</li>
      <li>I surely would.  </li>
      <li>ok well i have just got the shaver groomer ..</li>
      <li>and I love it.....</li>
      <li>They say to charge it for 12 or more hrs</li>
      <li>Hoping to be able to return it.</li>
      <li>Could be a better product if you could use it while it was plugged in, but you can&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>i truly wish i would have got something better then this..</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s many options.</li>
      <li>Mostly because if you use it you&#x27;ll run out of power and it&#x27;s just unnecessary.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good for what it&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>The regular blade has 3 lengths adjustable by a slide of a switch, thats the best part.</li>
      <li>He says it cuts great and is very well pleased.</li>
      <li>Crappy design, for 10 more bucks</li>
      <li>It gets better...    </li>
      <li>I love the rechargeable features as well.</li>
      <li>Glad I did.</li>
      <li>I love this item.</li>
      <li>it spends more time charging than it does shaving or trimming.</li>
      <li>Rest of the attachments are ok.</li>
      <li>AND it&#x27;s CHEAP!  </li>
      <li>you can get a much better razor</li>
      <li>Think of it more as an unsupported feature.&lt;br</li>
      <li>maybe even more ..</li>
      <li>Clean and oil the blades and that will make a 100% difference!</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it gets much better from here.     </li>
      <li>But I like the number of adjustments possible with the trimmer, and it certainly is ideal for beard trimming.  </li>
      <li>This works fine, but it is not the gental shaver it once was.  </li>
      <li>so I got another and its fine.  </li>
      <li>I love this trimmer, you have to leave it on the charger or it dies quickly.</li>
      <li>Parts and accessories should fit securely; they don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>The pieces simply don&#x27;t fit in the stand.  </li>
      <li>If you try to move the filled stand, 2 or 3 items will fall out every time you try to move it.  </li>
      <li>The Conair GMT189RGB is made of cheap plastic material and has a cheaper feel to it.</li>
      <li>Stand is flaky (parts don&#x27;t fit well)</li>
      <li>Just the feeling of it in your hand is cheap.  </li>
      <li>Cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Portable, comes with many useful extensions and is lightweight.</li>
      <li>None of the attachments that came with this fit on it at all.</li>
      <li>and trimming is also not as good as old one.</li>
      <li>but surprising it uses my old accessories .</li>
      <li>Bought it to replace the original that broke when dropped on my tile floor.</li>
      <li>I never had a problem with any of the components, but I do recommend you apply the lubrication and clean the blades every so often.</li>
      <li>I just re-read the instructions and they say to unplug the trimmer when not in use and to do a full 16 hourcharge every 3 months.</li>
      <li>True safety hazard.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect a full shave with the foil attachment</li>
      <li>I had it for about a year and got a hand full of uses out of it.</li>
      <li>Not bad considering minimum 3 day ship time.  </li>
      <li>and it works great for touching up her pretty little face.</li>
      <li>As advertised, quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Battery runs out quick and which results in not getting a quality shave.  </li>
      <li>Which I guess is how they make their money (they die quick</li>
      <li>Too long from receipt to return so we will see how good Conair&#x27;s warranty service works.  </li>
      <li>I love all the features of the new Conair.</li>
      <li>It has some slight differences but it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>But overall, pretty good at what it does.</li>
      <li>The mini- detailing head is great for working around areas of the face with little clearance, and removes hairs well.   </li>
      <li>not even worth the $15 I paid for it.</li>
      <li>The cord stays attached to the shaving unit unless one pulls it out, which I consider a drawback; an older unit just sat in the charging unit and could be easily lifted out.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The cord stays attached to the shaving unit unless one pulls it out, which I consider a drawback; an older unit just sat in the charging unit and could be easily lifted out.  The adjustable head is also a little finicky, and detaching it from the shaver head takes a little getting used to.  But I like the number of adjustments possible with the trimmer, and it certainly is ideal for beard trimming.  I have used it for three months now.</li>
    <li> This is my first conair. I use it for my scruffy, rat/pirate like stubble. I&#x27;m barely hairy at all so it&#x27;s probably not a big challenge ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I saw the low ratings and was like, \\&quot;WHAT this thing is amazing\\&quot; but then I read some of the reviews and thought .... yup ... they&#x27;re sorta right. But I still think it&#x27;s a 4 star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  - My battery does only really last for one or two shaves. This isn&#x27;t a big deal for me.  BUT AND this is big BUT - and I cannot lie :) the battery life dropped from great to where it stands today in a few short months and then stayed there. It hasn&#x27;t gotten much worse and I&#x27;ve had this for 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;  - I don&#x27;t know why it came with a stand ? That thing is useless!&lt;br /&gt;  - It does spit hair everywhere. Shave in the shower (NOT WITH THE WATER RUNNING!)&lt;br /&gt;  - That POWER mode is pretty silly. Mostly because if you use it you&#x27;ll run out of power and it&#x27;s just unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;  - Needs a little grease every 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  - Whoa, cheap!&lt;br /&gt;  - This is the only buzzer I found that works for stubble and doesn&#x27;t trim at varying lengths based on varying pressure AND it&#x27;s CHEAP!  Lots of other buzzers I tried had cool features and were more expensive but they all trimmed at different lengths based on pressure and made me look like a leper / goon ... I mean ... I have patchy hair - but not THAT patchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly 6 years I&#x27;m looking for a replacement ... that&#x27;s a pretty amazing life span for something that has only needed grease and cost $20 new.</li>
    <li> For use on pubic hair:  The spaces between the combs on this trimmer are so narrow that it can hardly pinch or nick any skin. My wife loves the way that this trims pubic hair without any cuts. Just remember to pull the shin straight and tight and never have razor burn or irritation again!</li>
    <li> This is actually the second conair razor I bought. Had a very similar one and last for about 4 years until battery was dead. So I ordered this one. It has some slight differences but it&#x27;s great. Definitely worth the price. 100% recommended</li>
    <li> I got this kit and plugged it in. The next day I went to use it and it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. Let it stay on charger another day still the same result. This thing is junk!</li>
    <li> Product page: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N5N3FE/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title    PLEASE READ ENTIRE REVIEW: It gets better...    The Ugly: Not the best instructions or pictures.  Stand &#x27;set up&#x27; instructions poor. Because of design, it&#x27;s hard to determine which accessories go (and fit) where on stand.  Even when I figured out what went where, they didn&#x27;t fit properly.  The instruction sheet picture quality is not good. In order to get a good picture of the stand with all accessories on it, I had to go to conair.com and blow up the picture from the instruction sheet.    The Bad: Storage/Charging Stand.  Unlike previous Conair multi-trimmers (over prior 18 years I&#x27;ve owned 2), this stand is poorly designed and manufactured.  The base should be weighted; it&#x27;s not.  Parts and accessories should fit securely; they don&#x27;t.  Stand should hold parts and accessories as if they were designed as a system; it doesn&#x27;t. Except for the trimmer body itself, the big beard guide and the oil tube, none of the other accessories really fit the stand properly.  If you try to move the filled stand, 2 or 3 items will fall out every time you try to move it.  Very poor design.           Changing Heads.  This could be a little better but isn&#x27;t really &#x27;bad.&#x27;  Read the instructions, and you&#x27;ll find removing the main head isn&#x27;t very difficult.  The [very minor] problem comes in putting the other heads on.  Be sure the white &#x27;drive pin&#x27; from the trimmer body is aligned with, and fits into the white plastic tube in the attachment before you apply pressure to secure the new head.  If you don&#x27;t, it appears you could risk damaging the plastic components.    Fortunately, it gets much better from here.     The Good: Trimmer body and accessories.  Good RPMs on motor. It does a good job trimming and doesn&#x27;t seem to bog down in thick or wiry hair.    The nose/ear attachment could be just a little longer to reach inside ear/nose. But even as is, the reach is adequate and it does a very decent job, although the cutting tip gets a little warm with prolonged use.   The mini- detailing head is great for working around areas of the face with little clearance, and removes hairs well.   The shaving foil works well on small areas for clean-ups, but is definitely not intended for full face shaves.   Haven&#x27;t used all the guides and combs, but those I have appear to do what they&#x27;re intended to do, and satisfactorily.   Haven&#x27;t tried it for bikini type trims, but appears it will do the job, as well.    All in all, and excepting the &#x27;charging&#x27; stand, it met all my expectations from previous Conairs I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;d have rated 5* if the stand wasn&#x27;t so poor.</li>
    <li> my husband is very happy with this shaver. He uses it daily and keeps his beard and mustache trimmed and tidy.&lt;br /&gt;He looks great, it works well.</li>
    <li> Update Review: ok well i have just got the shaver groomer .. i was trimming one side of my face for one hour maybe even more .. and no damn hair was coming out .. it look like i just ripped spots out.. and the battery just kept dying. on  i left it charging for over 5 or more hours and it keeps on dieing on me. They say to charge it for 12 or more hrs and i did after i read some comments but No Luck after a while i ended up getting a new battery and that made a big difference. As for trimming the side hair .. not good at all .. i truly wish i would have got something better then this..but for the time being its ok .. for trimming the beard and simple grooming.</li>
    <li> This works fine, but it is not the gental shaver it once was.  Ouch!</li>
    <li> I purchased a Conair All-In-One Grooming System about 8 years ago, almost identical to this one. It was used 2 or 3 times a week and still works as long as you keep it plugged in (the internal battery is to the point of not charging). The blades are original and still work as if new. We still use it but purchased this one so as to have one that doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged up while using. If this one lasts 8 years as the other one did, the cost per year is about $2.50. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it! I tried several other brands (I have 6 brothers, most with facial hair)and none of theirs lasted or stayed sharp like the Conair. I am a repeat Conair customer and will continue to be.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. The other lasted a long time and this is the second time purchasing.</li>
    <li> Not the worst by any means- however the blades are not as sharp for touch up trimming as some other brands that I have owned. And the run time is less than other brands that I have owned. The price was right and it does the job-it just has to be done before you have to recharge. I like Norelco the best.</li>
    <li> This is a poor excuse for an electric trimmer! No instructions... A   Ziplock bag is a better place to store the accessories than the charging stand! If the battery doesn&#x27;t hold up after a few months... It&#x27;s headed for the trash can!!!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for Christmas. He says it cuts great and is very well pleased.</li>
    <li> Conair should really be ConYou. These trimmers do the job, and have nice attachments, but this company uses the worst batteries. Which I guess is how they make their money (they die quick and you have to go out and get an other set). I used this trimmer once a week, and every single time, I would get about 5 seconds of use out of it before it would snag on my beard and die. I tried to remember to charge it the day before I needed it, but that just got real old real fast. Ultimately I smashed the living hell out of it and tossed it away. I had it for about a year and got a hand full of uses out of it. Unlike my $15 Braun electric shaver which I have had for about 7 years and still keeps a good 2 month charge.    I dont know why I thought this would be different, I have had zero luck with Conair products in the past. I guess I&#x27;m just stoopid. Totally not worth the money.</li>
    <li> The battery barely lasts and if it runs out, then you&#x27;re out of luck. Not only will it not work because the charge is gone, but even if you try to plug it in, it still won&#x27;t work until the battery recharges. Also, you cannot replace the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand doesn&#x27;t even seem like it&#x27;s made for the unit and everything falls out of it.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer!  It kinda dies every two years, but I get the same one when that happens.  I use it weekly.  Holds charge pretty well and it never catches my skin like other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Just what I husband wanted</li>
    <li> I have owned this model for about ten years and I am still using it to trim my beard etc.  It has a wide range of attachments to do anything and everything.After 10 years the motor was sounding a little tired and the blade was maybe not quite as sharp.  When looking for a new one I searched the internet to see what was out there.  Nothing had all the gadgets I had come accustomed to.  I searched for this model and thrilled to find it still available...the exact same one I have had all these years.  If you are hunting for a beard trimmer, this is the one to buy!</li>
    <li> I received this Conair Trimmer as a gift in 2005. I used this product at least on a weekly basis for all of my hair grooming, especially for keeping my hair manageable in between hair cuts. It worked great for nearly 7 years before the battery suddenly stopped charging. I never had a problem with any of the components, but I do recommend you apply the lubrication and clean the blades every so often. After I submit this review I will be purchasing another and I hope to get another 7 years from my new one.   I highly recommend this product for all general hair grooming purposes.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut/shave close enough. Nose/ear trimmer gets too hot with little usage. Note: just using with mustache so have not tried beard groomer attachments.</li>
    <li> After having a Wahl device where all the pieces floated around endlessly in a bathroom drawer, I was most excited to have a similar rig with a stand to hold all the accessories.  After spending half an hour feeling like  a first grader trying to put together a block puzzle, I went online to find the excellent first review here which suggests going online and enlarging the useless instruction book photo.  Even then, hopeless.  The pieces simply don&#x27;t fit in the stand.  And there&#x27;s no place at all in the stand for the nose and ear trimmer.  Why would I even bother to try out the product if they can&#x27;t make a cheap plastic stand that holds the pieces properly?  In an acronym: POS.</li>
    <li> Great machine. Used every week and I love it.....</li>
    <li> I like the variety of accessories to use to keep my beard looking good. I would but again. I love the rechargeable features as well. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer, you have to leave it on the charger or it dies quickly. This is the second one I have purchased and I hope to continue with this trimmer after this one dies. The regular blade has 3 lengths adjustable by a slide of a switch, thats the best part.</li>
    <li> Better than what i expected, should definitely give it a try,its worth the value at that price. Conair products are good</li>
    <li> This product performs well. I have been using it for over a year with no complaints. Second one I&#x27;ve owned. Bought it to replace the original that broke when dropped on my tile floor.</li>
    <li> I had been using this Conair for over 10 years, replacing it every 3-4 yrs just due to normal wear and tear.  I then decided to try something new and go with a Wahl, at twice the cost.  Well, that clipper became the dog&#x27;s clipper of choice within a month, and I went out and purchased a new Conair.  I&#x27;ll cry if they ever discontinue this model.  It&#x27;s light, strong, and works the best!</li>
    <li> Of the highest quality for self grooming.  Very complete although, lacking in accessory attachment instructions.  Requires admendment to this plight.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old one, which I got almost five years ago, and used daily! The battery finally kicked out on the old one, and the new one&#x27;s buzzing away like a champ!</li>
    <li> battery life is a bit shoddy, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great set and arrived on time.  My on dissatisfaction is with the trimmer itself.  The liner attachment isn&#x27;t very sharp so you don&#x27;t get a close shave if you plan on using it in that manner.</li>
    <li> I chose this because I had a Conair previously and really liked it. I like the ability to change lengths with this set. It works great and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t trim my beard all that often, but every d@mn time I want to, I have to remember to plug this useless garbage in 90-120min ahead of time, or there won&#x27;t be enough charge (even leaving the cord plugged in) to make the blades move..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I legitimately hate this thing, every time I pick it up, and end up cursing at it for not working, it is only my respect for my neighbors that keeps me from throwing it right out the freakin window...</li>
    <li> I love this item. I bought this for my boyfriend during no shave November so that when time came the thick beard would somewhat disappear! worked great! very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, until it stops working.  My son received one from his brother for Christmas and worked great....for a while.  When it stopped working, I bought the same item for his birthday, and just a few months later..... NOT WORKING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
    <li> Trimmer works great! Stand is flaky (parts don&#x27;t fit well) but the product works just fine &amp; holds a charge for a long time!</li>
    <li> Battery runs out quick and which results in not getting a quality shave.  I recommend getting the conair groom that plugs into the wall outlet.</li>
    <li> Waste. Of. Money.  Crappy design, for 10 more bucks you can get a much better razor</li>
    <li> for the money this product has many uses and appears to be made in the same order as the more expensive ones, for the money.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer works fine. I would buy the larger size is used for trimming beards though.&lt;br /&gt;The batteries remain charged for about two days.</li>
    <li> Nose and ear trimmer is not effective. Rest of the attachments are ok. Overall it is an ok product. Thanks</li>
    <li> not even worth the $15 I paid for it. I rarely write reviews; something has to be either really good or really bad for me to be bothered with writing one. this thing is bad. really, really bad. it spends more time charging than it does shaving or trimming. after a year of usage, it needs to be fully charged for me to 15 minutes out of it. back when I first bought it, I could at least get like 30 minutes on a full charge. which brings me to the reason why you should not buy this, &amp; the one thing that I wish I had known before purchasing this, as it would have been a deal breaker for the purchase--YOU CAN&#x27;T EVEN USE THIS TRIMMER WHEN IT&#x27;S CHARGING! nope. can&#x27;t do it. so unless this trimmer has a charge, it&#x27;s useless. &amp; that about sums up this razor--useless.</li>
    <li> Mine started on fire the 2nd time I charged it.  True safety hazard.  I&#x27;ve never had anything that scares me as much as this product.  Be certain you have your home insured for it&#x27;s replacement value and take pictures of absolutely everything you&#x27;ll need to replace.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this trimmer for more than 3-4 months, and the battery is already dead.  This is really a shame because I like the trimmer when it is actually working.  Unfortunately, without a functioning battery, it&#x27;s just a $20 paperweight.</li>
    <li> excelent product! just like you see in the photo. it works great</li>
    <li> Just as I expected, it was exactly what I wanted and needed.  Nothing else to say, it was perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Unlike my old Conair that I had for 12 years, this one doesn&#x27;t have much power and takes a lot longer to shave with than my old one that died. This one also says it is a 13 Piece, All-in-one system however, it is not. None of the attachments that came with this fit on it at all. I even tried to modify some of them to get them to work on it and that didn&#x27;t work, the heads were completely different and were obviously for a completely different model. Also, this one doesn&#x27;t get as close as my old Conair did. My old Conair would give me the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and this one gives you a 12 o&#x27;clock shadow. So if you&#x27;re looking for the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, get a different Conair because this one will not give it to you. The only reason I didn&#x27;t send it back is because I never use the attachments anyway, so it didn&#x27;t matter to me that they didn&#x27;t fit and I&#x27;ll deal with not having as close of a shadow as I&#x27;d like until I can find a better option locally.</li>
    <li> The shaver itself seems to function well, but the attachments and the base are much cheaper quality and a poor design compared to my previous one.</li>
    <li> Terrific beard trimmer and holds a charge for a looonnng time too!</li>
    <li> This is the second Conair trimmer I have purchased. The first one still works but the batteries no longer hold a charge so I figured I deserved a new one. This ione is much slimer than my old one (it had an adjustable head which I never used) so I actually like the slimer version. It works just like my other one so I am very satisfied with it as a beard trimer. I tried the nose/ear trimer but it&#x27;s kind of a hastle to change the head so I don&#x27;t use the attachments.. It isn&#x27;t hard to change the adapters just a bit more trouble than I personally to spend as I have a nose/ear trimer.. I did notice the head of the nose/ear trimer attachment got very warm while using it.</li>
    <li> I never know when it is totally charged. It will be nice that ligth would change from red to green when battery is full.</li>
    <li> I do not know if I got unlucky or something, but I purchased this to replace the Conair that I had for years but I dropped and broke.  I noticed this one was a little less expensive than the original one I had.  Well, there&#x27;s a reason.  The battery is good for one day.  So now I have the plan ahead of time to use it.  I have to plug it in for at least six hours to get one shave out of it.  Then in two days the battery is dead again.  I wonder if the difference between this model and the model that is $5 more expensive is the battery.  If so, go for the more expensive model.  Or maybe I got unlucky and got a bad battery.</li>
    <li> I had one of these before and lost the parts so I got another and its fine.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and does the job</li>
    <li> I just bought this for my husband. He fully charged it and the battery died before he was halfway done shaving his face. He&#x27;s tried it twice, both times he had to stop mid shave to charge it again (and it&#x27;s not a quick charge). Could be a better product if you could use it while it was plugged in, but you can&#x27;t. Hoping to be able to return it. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> but received a model that came pedi which does the job</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this product.  It does not cut but pulls the hair and really hurts.  My first thought was that perhaps the blades needed oiling but that did not resolve the situation.&lt;br /&gt;I had owned a Conair trimmer in the past and really liked it.  I dropped and broke the one I had and so I purchased the Conair GMT189RGB as a replacement.  The Conair GMT189RGB is made of cheap plastic material and has a cheaper feel to it. Even with that I did not expect it&#x27;s inability to cut.  It literally pulls the beard hair to the point that it can&#x27;t be used.  I ended up having to buy another brand.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for all that&#x27;s included.</li>
    <li> It does not trim my mustache</li>
    <li> This product works better than advertized.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about a couple of months.  At first it was a little difficult changing the heads, mostly due to a concern  with breaking them. They don&#x27;t; product seems sturdy so far. Don&#x27;t be concerned with the added heat. The instructions even say that this model will heat up. Think of it more as an unsupported feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage base is a complete waste. Not only is it difficult to figure out how to locate everything on it, removing the the main piece makes all the others jump out of position.  The main piece can be set up to plug into the charger through the base, don&#x27;t. None of the pieces click into the base and are not held in place. The slightest jostle to the base sets the parts flying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember that you&#x27;re not buying this for its neat compact storage, you&#x27;re buying it for grooming - which it does very well.</li>
    <li> Used it twice when I first got it. After those two times, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold its charge at all. So now I have to have it plugged in all the time.</li>
    <li> For $20, this little conair beard/grooming trimmer works pretty well. It feels a little bit lighter and &#x27;cheaper&#x27; than a previous version of this trimmer I bought back in 2006 or so. But overall, pretty good at what it does. Wish it came with a replacement blade - seems like such a waste to throw the whole thing away.</li>
    <li> Replacing one many years old. I expect this will last may years also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for over 4 years and it has worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed reviews on the battery losing it&#x27;s charge. That happened to me as well after 3 years but I decided to try OILING it! After many many uses the attachments get dry and that is the reason why the battery loses charge, because it takes more energy for the blade to move back and forth. Just OIl it and it will purr like its brand new and keep a longer charge.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars because I&#x27;ve trimmed a lot of hair over the years and it will trim for many years to come. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I do agree thought that the holder was a joke, just purchase a little toiletry bag and keep attachments in that. I&#x27;m on the road a lot so there was no reason to use the holder anyways.</li>
    <li> Good. Portable, comes with many useful extensions and is lightweight. Only downside is that the battery doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> Only Brand I will Buy!!</li>
    <li> It just arrived to replace a 5+ year old Conair.  I purchased this (with base) to replace one I had with a base.  Well I did not get a base.  I just noticed the second photo, I got a bag instead of a base.  Very disappointed because I was after the base.</li>
    <li> I took this conair model because I had similar conair grooming system but main system is not working so thought of buying this one so I  can use all accessories in this new one. but surprising it uses my old accessories . Drawback is quality of  new conair model is worst then old one. weight is low. no TURBO option like my old one. and trimming is also not as good as old one.</li>
    <li> this is my second pair and the batteries life suck. 3 months tops on both. i guess u get what u paid for</li>
    <li> the product came as it was suppose to and it was exactly what I ordered, still use it several times a week</li>
    <li> es muy buena la rasuradora multiuso, llego en excelentes condiciones y en el tiempo estimado, el distribuidor es muy bueno</li>
    <li> My husband had the same one for many years until it gave out on him. I ordered this for him to replace the old one.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the most amazing hair trimmer, the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long so we just leave it charging, but it works great for the price.</li>
    <li> On first use, the speed was varying, but then smoothed out.  Was 3 weeks before I tried to use again and it was dead. Would not charge. Too long from receipt to return so we will see how good Conair&#x27;s warranty service works.  Shipping unit out to AZ in next day or so. Will post results as I get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - It took just over a week to get a replacement. Not bad considering minimum 3 day ship time.  Replacement was new trimmer, not a refurb unit.  It works great.  Have to give kudos to Conair for taking care of their customers. I have raised my rating from 2 to 4 stars.</li>
    <li> If I could give less than a star I surely would.  Buying this is like throwing your money out an open window.  I wont even begin to get into all the reasons, but just warning people to stay away!!!</li>
    <li> Good for what it&#x27;s worth</li>
    <li> I just bought the Conair GMT189RGB because of past experience with Conair. I have had 2 Norelco beard and moustache trimmers in the past and they barley lasted a year for each one. Then I bought the Conair trimmer in April of 1997. It has lasted me 16 years and it still holds a charge. The blades are dull, that&#x27;s why I replaced it with this newer model. I agree with everyone else, a little more thought could have gone into the storage tray. I left my old Conair on the charger all the time. Every 6 months I would run my trimmer down until it quit running and then recharge. This keeps the battery conditioned. I intend to do the same with my new one. I love all the features of the new Conair. Don&#x27;t expect a full shave with the foil attachment but, it is great for touch ups. I find that the nose trimmer is perfect for me. Does a great job. I&#x27;m not trying to slice and dice boogers. The bigger nose trimmers would give me razor burn inside my nose. Very painful! The attachments also do a nice job trimming hair off the back of my neck. I was going to throw my old Conair away but, it still has a lot of life left in it. So, I tried the old one out on my cocker spaniels face. The old Conair has now become my dog grooming trimmer and it works great for touching up her pretty little face. Better than my Wahl battery operated pet trimmer! I did buy the Norelco beard and moustache grooming kit to replace the old Conair. I brought it home, took it out of the box and right back in the box it went. Cheaply made. Took it back for a refund and bought the Conair. Glad I did. I think Conair makes a great product and I will continue to be a loyal Conair customer. By the way, if you trimmer seems to be running a little slow. Clean and oil the blades and that will make a 100% difference! I gave Conair 5 stars because of it&#x27;s performance and it&#x27;s many options. I have to correct myself. I just re-read the instructions and they say to unplug the trimmer when not in use and to do a full 16 hourcharge every 3 months. The new trimmer will have to be charged 3 times before the battery reaches full capacity. I will do what the instructions say. I want my trimmer to last. Hope you find this review helpful.</li>
    <li> Awful! Stopped working 30 days after I bought it!</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted</li>
    <li> This item was as described and still is performing as I expected it would I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Works Really well and my brother loves it..</li>
    <li> It was just what I expected.</li>
    <li> As advertised, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This shaver works alright with the guard on. If you want to use it with the guard off to get a stubble look then get ready to bleed. This thing pulls more hair out of my neck than it actually cuts.</li>
    <li> I was unpleasantly surprised by the size of the beard and mustache cutting comb. It projects out so far (even at the closest position) that the only way to cut the part of my mustache under my nose is to turn the device sideways. Beard cutting is complicated by the need to switch to one of three jawline beard cutting attachments, and picking the right one is trial-and-error. This Conair is no better for beards and mustaches than using the hair cutting system I already own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous beard cutter was a Panasonic with a removable, 9-position comb that flexed a bit at the jawline. It was much easier to use.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer! Love it!</li>
    <li> Very good ,use often.</li>
    <li> This machine has some power...</li>
    <li> I had an older rechargeable Conair trimmer that I used for years and loved it, which is why I purchased this one when it finally died.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  This thing is terrible.  Just the feeling of it in your hand is cheap.  It won&#x27;t hold a charge nearly as long as the old one.  The blades move at half the speed and it pulls the hair.  Every time I go to use it it&#x27;s dead and it won&#x27;t charge while it&#x27;s turned on.  It might be acceptable in China where they can&#x27;t grow beards but not here.</li>
    <li> Didnt even come with the right peices</li>
    <li> There is no connection between the AC cable and the motor.  If the battery is unable the hold a charge, you will not be able to use it even plugged in.  For me, this shortened the lifespan to less than a year before it left my beard half chewed.</li>
