      <li>I really liked this wig.</li>
      <li>The quality is PERFECT, as a cosplayer I found this very helpful.</li>
      <li>It was amazing how fast it came and great quality!</li>
      <li>When it arrvied it was nicely packaged.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to style and it doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
      <li>IT CAME IN EARLY AND I&#x27;M SO HAPPY !</li>
      <li>i was worried with how cheap it was that it wouldn&#x27;t be a good wig</li>
      <li>The wig is beautiful and soft and amazing.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a fraction more shiny, and I&#x27;m unsure about whether this wig was heat resistant.</li>

      <li>It also makes you look exactly like Mikasa :^)</li>
      <li>Thank you! :)</li>
      <li>I love the wig a lot.</li>
      <li>The length was a bit long for Mikasa, but not all wigs are perfect.</li>
      <li>It was delivered faster than expected which is awesome.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s easy to correct</li>
      <li>I wear it nearly every night just for fun, and it takes a bit of styling with my fingers to get the bangs right, but it ends up looking awesome in the end.</li>
      <li>Maybe soak it in fabric softener for a bit if it&#x27;s too shiny for your taste, but it was fine for me.</li>
      <li>When it arrived about a month or so after I ordered it, I fell in love with it so much that it&#x27;s become my favorite wig.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am so GLAD I purchased this wig because I absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>wore this to a comic con and it was comfortable as well!</li>
      <li>Great quality wig, just needed some minor styling as all wigs do.</li>
      <li>Then again, I should have known better for a wig that was pretty inexpensive.</li>
      <li>but it was TOTALLY worth it!</li>
      <li>The overall quality of the hair was nice, there were just so many shortcomings that I wouldn&#x27;t ever consider buying again.</li>
      <li>a LITTLE (not a lot, I just have a very good sense of smell)</li>
      <li>I was so hoping that this wig would look nice and fit properly and everything.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a buy.</li>
      <li>It also arrived super fast which was a bonus!</li>
      <li>It is super light and very soft.</li>
      <li>The wig is very durable and its now my new favorite wig.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easily adjusted and has straps at the back that you can tighten to fit your head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The bangs are a bit long, but I cut them a bit- other than that, great quality wig !</li>
      <li>When I felt the wig it was very silky and very very shiny!</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>I had bought this wig earlier in the year for my Mikasa Ackerman cosplay and it is fantastic!</li>
      <li>It will work for a last minute cosplay I&#x27;m doing, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again if I had more time to plan.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of my first times buying a wig</li>
      <li>FAST!</li>
      <li>More like a younger Mikasa Ackerman wig.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But more than that it is way too short.</li>
      <li>I wish I could give this a higher score.</li>
      <li>this one kind of had one side longer than the other</li>
      <li>Other than that, it turned out nice, and I like it.</li>
      <li>This wig was a bit of a mess, to put it nicely.</li>
      <li>SO REAL THANK</li>
      <li>The bangs were a straight cut across the forehead.</li>
      <li>You may need to get some gel or hairspray to hold the bangs in place, but it&#x27;s not too much of a hassle.</li>
      <li>It was like using a Halloween wig, very plastic like and became staticy as soon as I took it out of the package.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this !</li>
      <li>The color is really realistic and not too shinny or so.</li>
      <li>I recieved it early and only had to trim the bangs an inch or two to fit it</li>
      <li>Very soft, and looks like real hair.</li>
      <li>If I could compare this wig to a more well known brand, I would say it&#x27;s very similar to an Epic Cosplay wig, the only difference being</li>
      <li>It is nice and thick and my daughter wears it every day to pretend to be Mikasa.</li>
      <li>Nice thick layers and doesn&#x27;t show through.</li>
      <li>The wig was a pretty decent quality, exactly what should be expected from the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to this</li>
      <li>, it has a very natural touch to it.</li>
      <li>This wig is of better quality than some of the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
      <li>Its fibers are nice, and its very thick, preventing whats under to be shown.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great quality wig, just needed some minor styling as all wigs do.</li>
    <li> Not the best wig, but not the worst. I purchased the Mikasa wig, and it didn&#x27;t come in that well. It&#x27;s a bit frazzled in places, and is hard to keep right when styled. Maybe mine just had defects, you never know.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of hair though, soft hair-- Which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Came early, which was well.&lt;br /&gt;Was a lot longer than expected. More like a younger Mikasa Ackerman wig.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying a new one from another seller because I can&#x27;t bring myself to cut the long soft hair..</li>
    <li> Love it! Looks just like in the photo!</li>
    <li> This was an awesome quality wig! It came already styled and has good quality fibers. It also arrived super fast which was a bonus!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Mikasa. I am disappointed. The wig is beautiful and soft and amazing. The wig it&#x27;s self is very small. But more than that it is way too short. Definitely meant for a male character. It is not a bad wig in the least and I am giving it to a friend for his up coming cosplay. I wish I could give this a higher score. But the disappointment I felt when I opened this almost had me in tears.</li>
    <li> I love the wig a lot. It got here wearily than expected and almost feels like real hair, it&#x27;s really an amazing wig.</li>
    <li> The actual with was too short in length, like a pixie cut instead of nearly shoulder length. The bangs were a straight cut across the forehead. Terrible product, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really liked this wig. The color is really realistic and not too shinny or so. My only con was that the wig was a bit long and it was really thin. The back Hair also began to curve outwards. Other then that, it&#x27;s pretty! Recommend.</li>
    <li> IT CAME IN EARLY AND I&#x27;M SO HAPPY ! IT LOOKS SO REAL THANK YOU !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT SHIPPING! FAST! EXCELLENT! LOVE IT!  I HAVE ONE IN PURPLE AND ITS JUST AS GREAT. NOW I HAVE A BLACK ONE AND A PURPLE ONE! THEY LAST FOREVER AND MY ONLY RELIABLE WIGS!</li>
    <li> The wig is perefect! It looks just like the anime! The middle mid part isnt set in stone so you can make it just like you want. The wig is very durable and its now my new favorite wig. It also came over ten days early!</li>
    <li> poor quality, hair falls down everywhere</li>
    <li> i was worried with how cheap it was that it wouldn&#x27;t be a good wig but it is. it&#x27;s so soft and isn&#x27;t too thin (it doesn&#x27;t show the wig cap/weave underneath). The bangs are a little long so one can trim them to fit them.</li>
    <li> This wig came in MUCH MUCH earlier than expected. It arrived about one week after I ordered it! I expected it to be a little &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34; because of its cheap price, but I was wrong. The quality is PERFECT, as a cosplayer I found this very helpful. Its fibers are nice, and its very thick, preventing whats under to be shown. The wig is shoulder length, which makes it not only usable for Mikasa, but as well as other characters. The way its made allows you to style it to our liking, but not only that, it has a very natural touch to it. Its not too shiny or dull at all. Overall, the quality and shipping deserves an A+. I highly recommend this !</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Shipping took 14 days, which is approximately 2 weeks. Way quicker than the expected arrival date.&lt;br /&gt;-Packaged securely.&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap&lt;br /&gt;-SOFT and good quality&lt;br /&gt;-can be straightened&lt;br /&gt;-easily styled&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-smells a LITTLE (not a lot, I just have a very good sense of smell) but after it airs out, the smell goes away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so GLAD I purchased this wig because I absolutely fell in love with it. I would definitely order another wig from this seller. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! The quality is up and beyond. Nice thick layers and doesn&#x27;t show through.</li>
    <li> Great wig for the price! The hair is very thick and looks quite natural, not to mention easy to style! It&#x27;s easily adjusted and has straps at the back that you can tighten to fit your head.&lt;br /&gt;I was really pleased with my wig! You won&#x27;t be disappointed in the price or quality!</li>
    <li> The wig is great. Perfect length and great material. Would definitely recommend for any cosplayer.</li>
    <li> This wig is of better quality than some of the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve purchased! Definitely worth a buy. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> the shipping did take about 3-4 weeks but it was TOTALLY worth it! The wig quality is amazing and it represents Mikasa&#x27;s hair perfectly! The bangs are a bit long, but I cut them a bit- other than that, great quality wig ! love it !</li>
    <li> This is simply a perfect wig for Mikasa! You may need to get some gel or hairspray to hold the bangs in place, but it&#x27;s not too much of a hassle.</li>
    <li> A tad short for Mikasa and for my head.</li>
    <li> The wig was a little lopsided and as I figured, it wasn&#x27;t styled. I never expect them to be styled but this one kind of had one side longer than the other but it didn&#x27;t bother me since I&#x27;ll be cutting it anyway.</li>
    <li> The wig was a pretty decent quality, exactly what should be expected from the price. It looked realistic, which is a big plus in my book, the only problem was the fact that it was shorter than i imagined and that some hair keeps falling off.</li>
    <li> I was so hoping that this wig would look nice and fit properly and everything. When it arrived about a month or so after I ordered it, I fell in love with it so much that it&#x27;s become my favorite wig. I wear it nearly every night just for fun, and it takes a bit of styling with my fingers to get the bangs right, but it ends up looking awesome in the end. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase!</li>
    <li> good quality wig for cosplay</li>
    <li> Way too short, i expected it to go past my shoulders a bit so i can have it a little long for mikasa. I was hoping it would be great but i expected it longer. I will use it for another cosplay i&#x27;m doing. I mean if you need a short length wig, get it but its very short. I&#x27;ll provide pictures.</li>
    <li> Very soft, and looks like real hair. Maybe soak it in fabric softener for a bit if it&#x27;s too shiny for your taste, but it was fine for me. The length was a bit long for Mikasa, but not all wigs are perfect. After cutting and styling it, it was perfect, and I got a lot of compliments on my cosplay at Anime Expo this past summer. If I could compare this wig to a more well known brand, I would say it&#x27;s very similar to an Epic Cosplay wig, the only difference being it&#x27;s a fraction more shiny, and I&#x27;m unsure about whether this wig was heat resistant. I didn&#x27;t want to test that out, however. All and all, a very good wig, and you will be pleased.</li>
    <li> This is not a cheap looking wig. It is nice and thick and my daughter wears it every day to pretend to be Mikasa. It looks great on her. It was delivered faster than expected which is awesome. I ordered it because of other reviews that said it wasn&#x27;t a straight black color but had different shades in it. The one we received was straight black but it still looks great and doesn&#x27;t bother my daughter at all. Great value for the price. If you are looking for a wig to dress up as Mikasa, this would be a great choice.</li>
    <li> This wig was a bit of a mess, to put it nicely. It&#x27;s almost impossible to re-style and you&#x27;re going to end up with hair in your face where it shouldn&#x27;t be no matter what. The overall quality of the hair was nice, there were just so many shortcomings that I wouldn&#x27;t ever consider buying again. Then again, I should have known better for a wig that was pretty inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wig for Mikasa Ackerman, and the quality is amazing! The hair feels and looks better than I imagined, and was without any tangles at all. Even with standard shipping, the item came in the mail in a little over 10 business days (that&#x27;s two weeks) before the expected arrival date. As a highly satisfied customer, I recommend this wig to any Mikasa Ackerman cosplayers out there.</li>
    <li> The wig is perfect and accurate! There might be a few hairs sticking out but that can be fixed easily.&lt;br /&gt;I wore this to a comic con and it was comfortable as well! It also makes you look exactly like Mikasa :^)</li>
    <li> The projected shipping date takes roughly 3-5 weeks, but this wig arrived in a little over 2 weeks. It&#x27;s super-nice even inside the box, and looks equally as nice as when you put it on! It&#x27;s one of my first times buying a wig but I&#x27;m pretty happy with it! I agree with all of the other reviews. The only largest downside for me though is that it&#x27;s slightly shorter than I envisioned. I was hoping that it would reach down to my neck, but it&#x27;s half-way between my head and neck. I&#x27;m goign to attempt to straighten it to make it longer, but other than its short length, I definitely recommend it for its combination of price + quality!</li>
    <li> good, but some hair would fall off</li>
    <li> This is an excellent wig: Is full and not shiny. I&#x27;m thinking to wear it someday to go out! (:</li>
    <li> It was amazing how fast it came and great quality! Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> Its really nice and I like it. but should be worried that a few strands came out? I&#x27;m new to this so could anyone tell me how to tell where the front is on the Mikasa wig? </li>
    <li> The wig was a great length, but the quality of the hair was very cheap. It was like using a Halloween wig, very plastic like and became staticy as soon as I took it out of the package. Mediocre for the price, I&#x27;ve paid ten dollars before and received a wig with MUCH better quality. It will work for a last minute cosplay I&#x27;m doing, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again if I had more time to plan.</li>
    <li> I wasnt going to use this wig for cosplaying attack on titans. But, its short and black and its what I needed. When it arrvied it was nicely packaged. When I felt the wig it was very silky and very very shiny! And it shedded alot! That wasnt a schocked to be honest. Other than that, it turned out nice, and I like it.</li>
    <li> Amazing&lt;br /&gt;It came with a wig cap and was perfect for my mikasa cosplay&lt;br /&gt;the only issue is that it&#x27;s a tad crazy the hair kinda does its own thing but that&#x27;s easy to correct</li>
    <li> I love this wig!!!!! I had bought this wig earlier in the year for my Mikasa Ackerman cosplay and it is fantastic! I recieved it early and only had to trim the bangs an inch or two to fit it so I could see. It is super light and very soft. I had gotten a lot of complements when I had worn it to the convention I had bought it for. It is very easy to style and it doesn&#x27;t tangle. It is one of my favorite wigs to wear.</li>
