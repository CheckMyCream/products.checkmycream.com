<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i like it but it does have a high pitch white noise</li>
    <li> Love the ZAQ DEW!! Easy to use and clean. Looks very modern wherever I place it. Love that you can set a color depending on mood. Disperses essential oils very well. Wish I could afford to have multiples so I wouldn&#x27;t have to move it from room to room ;)</li>
    <li> This is a lovely diffuser....perfect size and it works wonderfully.  I love the changing colors and the way it has an automatic shut-off.  So glad I purchased it on Amazon.  Excellent price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my living room and loved the colors . . . for the two times I used it.  Totally stopped working.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this diffuser - and I love the color change (I always pick aqua lol) - really finding this unit to work well.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:65135fb0c21171899b148aead012d7f3]] I have come to love using oil diffusers in my home lately and I think it is safe to say I am addicted with diffusing essential oils in my home.I have used this oil diffuser for a couple days straight now and love it.It looks very pretty with its multi-changing colors and gives a calm environment effect in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ lightweight - this is made of plastic exterior therefore making it really simple for me to lift and move to different areas of the home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ one touch simple operational button - no need to worry yourself with pressing multiple buttons for timer, off, on, etc. this one has one button on the unit located near the rim of the diffuser cone for convenient access and also stays lit with a blue led light to indicate it is on.There are different functions for each press which you can press up to 4 times here is what they functions are with each press:&lt;br /&gt;1 press &#x3D; turns on the unit (misting/unit colors change)&lt;br /&gt;2 press &#x3D; color fixed.If you like one color better than the other and want to keep it from cycling this is the press you need to use.&lt;br /&gt;3 press &#x3D; turns the lighting off but keeps the misting on&lt;br /&gt;4 press &#x3D; turns the whole thing off no misting no lighting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ multi color changing lights - blue,green,yellow,red,purple,white led light show for you to enjoy while relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+operates with wall plug it comes with  no batteries needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ water capacity is decent 80ML max&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Comes with:&lt;br /&gt; - DC Jack&lt;br /&gt; - Unit&lt;br /&gt; - plastic measuring cup for water measurement&lt;br /&gt; - English instruction pamphlet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+nice modern design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Easy to clean : I use a damp cloth and wipe the inside thoroughly and follow up with a qtip to clean any residue left behind until I think it is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-CONS:&lt;br /&gt; None so far.Pretty content with tis diffuser I will report back if I run into any problems along the way but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPECS:&lt;br /&gt;Product size: 180x107mm&lt;br /&gt;Voltage: DC 24V&lt;br /&gt;Power: 12 W&lt;br /&gt;Water Capacity: 80ML&lt;br /&gt;Can run 3 to 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;Made in China&lt;br /&gt;Comes in 2 other colors Purple and White I have the black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: Sample was provided at a discount for evaluation purposes.far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPECS:&lt;br /&gt;Product size: 180x107mm&lt;br /&gt;Voltage: DC 24V&lt;br /&gt;Power: 12 W&lt;br /&gt;Water Capacity: 80ML&lt;br /&gt;Can run 3 to 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;Made in China&lt;br /&gt;Comes in 2 other colors Purple and White I have the black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: Sample was provided at a discount for evaluation purposes.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about aroma therapy when I took a chance and got this.  Now I can admit that I LOVE it.  The mister works wonderfully to disperse the oils ( we change oil types and mixtures each evening as we go to bed. The scent quickly fills the entire room 12x12. The auto shut off works to keep us from having to worry about shutting it off.  The colored light, which I thought I would dislike, is a nice addition to our bedroom as we drift off to sleep.  Going to buy another of the same model for my office.</li>
    <li> I have purchased four of these now.  My kids love them.  I use mine day and night.  Highly recommend.  Be sure to use distilled water in these.</li>
    <li> Awful already broke and it&#x27;s been three months</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for about a month, but it&#x27;s working great so far.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this diffuser! I spent a lot of time researching before I bought it- I wanted something small that could easily fit on my nightstand, and wanted to be sure the diffuser didn&#x27;t heat the oil/water (not good for oils). I run this in my bedroom at night- it helps with the dry air (due to electric heaters) and keeps the room smelling wonderful. I add 5-6 drops of essential oil to my water and let the diffuser go to work. My favorite scents to use are eucalyptus and rose otto. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a serene/spa experience at home.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these diffusers.  I have one set up on a wood table in my living room, and it leaves absolutely no water residue at all.  I gave one to my daughter, and she told me there was water on her table after running it.  On further investigation, we discovered that her five-year-old liked to take the top off during operation and watch the water bubble and gurgle inside!  Leave the top on, and you will have no problem.  :-)  Even with the light function turned off, the on/off button gives off a good amount of light, just right for a night light.  When I use it in my bedroom, I prop a small piece of cardboard over the on/off button when I sleep to solve that &amp;#34;problem.&amp;#34;  It runs quietly and turns itself off when it runs out of water.</li>
    <li> The best looking diffuser I think I have ever seen. I was so excited about getting this one, after going through several other &amp;#34;air freshener&amp;#34; looking, cheap diffusers that actually ended up not working after a few uses. This one is well made and had not gave up on me or given me issues like the others. Plus, its pretty. 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> Works good helps breathing</li>
    <li> Use it everyday in my sons rom. Leaves no water vapor on my wood furniture.</li>
    <li> Great product but my first one quit working,  Amazon immediately took care of this and it works great!</li>
    <li> Works great! I use different scents in day to freshen house, but at night I use the Ovio Sinus Blend.  Totally satisfied. Haven&#x27;t snored in weeks!!</li>
    <li> Great. Love the black.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty sneaky of this company to make such a perfect little product.  In fact, I think they PLANNED for my children to fight over this just so I would have to purchase another.  Which, I fell for.  Well played, Zaq...well played.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This emits just the right amount of &amp;#34;vapor&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s super easy to clean, a breeze to relocate, and a cinch to refill. And it looks cool while doing all that.  Purchased one in black then another in white and love them both!</li>
    <li> We love this defuser. We have 3.</li>
    <li> I love my diffuser.  I bought this one to use at work since the first one I bought and have used for over 9 months has worked so well.  I use it every night diffusing doterra lavendar essential oil to help me sleep.  At work I use it with different doterra oils depending on what is needed at the time.  It has been wonderful and I have had no problems with either diffuser.  At night I love watching the changing colors, which I find to be very calming. I have bought the same product as gifts for family members so I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for a friend. They loved it. Really relaxing.</li>
    <li> It has worked great so far for several months, and puts out a great smell. Although I will agree with some, even if you turn the rotating lights off, that blue on button is still pretty bright. All in all, still worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a diffuser for quite some time now.  I have a drawer full of essential oils and had no way of using them effectively to get the maximum benefit.  So when I received this diffuser I was so anxious to get it up and running.  It came packaged so nicely and securely.  In the bottom section of the box there was an ac adapter and great information about how to use and take care of your new diffuser!  It was very detailed and easy to understand.  I quickly had my diffuser filled with water and a few drops of my favorite combination of oils, which happened to be vanilla and orange.  I knew it would make a pleasant scent, but what I was truly surprised about was how quickly my entire livingroom was infused with this sweet smell.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how powerful this would be because of its compact size but it works beautifully!  I also enjoy the fact that when I first turn it on the colors cycle through many very beautiful vibrant colors but if I press the power button on a specific color it will stay that color the entire time it is running.  This feature makes this diffuser especially nice because it can fit in to a wide range of decor and color schemes!  Perfect for any room.  Another impressive feature is the units ability to shut off when it runs out of fluid.  Because of this I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting a little lavender oil in it and falling asleep with it on my nightstand.  This diffuser is beautiful, functional and effective and I would highly recommend it!  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> compatible but potent! love it!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this aromatherapy essential oil diffuser! I received this during a promotional discount and will be getting more of these to give out as gifts for this years Christmas gifts. This diffuser does have a light mist feeling the air with the oils of my choice. This modern design fits perfectly in with my bedroom furniture. The mist is so light that it does not leave any water in the surrounding area and I do not have to worry about damaging my furniture. At night we turn the light no and it is not bright so we can sleep with it on. Its very therapeutic and helps us unwind after a long day.</li>
    <li> I love this product so far...I have only had it for a day though so we will see how it holds up. I love the lights and it throws scent throughout my room and the living room with no problem! I might just buy another one for the upstairs.</li>
    <li> I put this in a stuffy attic room and fixed it right up.  Never had one of these before, but I won&#x27;t be without one in this room.  I&#x27;ve used it frequently for several months without a problem.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works well with my essentials oils to help me with breathing on bad Asthma days.  Also I was having trouble sleeping.  Using  this diffuser with my oils has helped me not only fall asleep, but also stay asleep :)</li>
    <li> it,s plastic  and  not 220v</li>
    <li> I love it. It works great and looks great too. Clean it out and it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> easy to use and it works perfectly!!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! I put 1 drop of eucalyptus oil and the whole my daughters room smelled so good. Thanks you for the discount of launching promotion. My opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> Great... Product!!!  Enjoying the mist and the scent!  Very innovative product.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Works great, runs 8-9 hours or so it seems with various oils.</li>
    <li> This holds a ton of water, easily runs 8 hours. Best part - it has an auto shutoff feature when it runs out of water- I didn&#x27;t see that promoted. Note- the black part looks plasticky- but it has four settings with color changes. All in all a great purchase! I bought a set of oils that go wonderfully with it.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well in out Living Room which is a good 600 sqft. I love it. We use it daily, especially when people come over. Yes we have used citrus oils in it.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  It&#x27;s soooo relaxing and I love the colors and the aroma&#x27;s!  I want more.</li>
    <li> Works just like it says</li>
    <li> I really liked the way it looked and worked, but it broke down after couple months of use. I can&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
    <li> I love this! Whatever scent you want &amp; The multicolor is fun!</li>
    <li> I have just started with aromatherapy and was thrilled to be chosen to review this product. The packaging was really nice and the misting unit was encased well. The instructions showed that you could make the lights on the diffuser rotate colors, stay on one in particular, or off completely. It was simple/easy to understand, and I&#x27;ve been using it in our living room on a very regular basis. The little measuring cup that came with it was a nice touch because it allowed me to ensure I used just the right amount of water. This is diffuser is quiet and the unit really puts out quite a bit of mist fragrance. I&#x27;ve used it for days when I&#x27;ve been really stressed out with a little lavender oil, and I really enjoy using it. I feel the product is sturdy, and well made, and the design is beautiful and graceful looking. I feel this product is well worth the price and would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;****edited July 10, 2015*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had this for even 3 months and its stopped working. I tried plugging it in different places and its little power light is on but the diffuser itself will not power on. Very disappointed! Had to remove the 5 stars and make it a 1 star. There&#x27;s other diffusers for the same price... Try those, this does not pass the test when it comes to dependability and use over time. I used it maybe 4-5 times before it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this in exchange for my honest review. All thoughts here are my own.</li>
    <li> I really loved it for the first two months, but one day recently it stopped working completely; now when I press the on switch - it lights up for a second, then turns off, and is completely dead. I&#x27;m disappointed that it turned out to be a waste of money. Now to find a more reliable brand....</li>
    <li> Not worth the cost. Very poorly made and no color changes.</li>
    <li> I got this product for review purposes and I love it .. First its beautiful and its so sleek.. I love the beautiful lights and the smell it creates that invigorates the whole room when you put in the oils you want to add.. I would highly recommend this to anyone..</li>
    <li> This multi-color aromatherapy diffuser is very stylish and super cute. I love all the LED color changing lights. You will receive an aromatherapy diffuser, detachable AC/DC adapter, measuring cup and detailed instruction booklet. Fill the diffuser with water up to the fill-line. It holds approximately 80ml. Add 3 to 5 drops of your favorite essential oil. Then close the diffuser and press the button to start. The button has 4 options.&lt;br /&gt;Option 1 - Turns on the diffuser. Misting is on with color changing lights&lt;br /&gt;Option 2 - Misting on with one single color fixed&lt;br /&gt;Option 3 - Misting on with lights off&lt;br /&gt;Option 4 - Misting and lights are both turned off&lt;br /&gt;I like using an aromatherapy diffuser every night. I use essential oils that have eucalyptus or other mint properties. This helps with sinuses and headaches at night. I have been sleeping better with this diffuser. It diffuses a good amount and releases the essential oils with a great smell. I live to use this in my living room during the day with lemon essential oil. It stays on for approximately 4 hours. You can turn the lights off but the on/off still lights up in blue. I do wish this light would go off when you turn the lights off. Other than that, this is an amazing aromatherapy diffuser. It&#x27;s very stylish so you can leave this in any room of your home. I received this product to test in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I love this multi-color aromatherapy diffuser!</li>
    <li> Works really well in my small-ish apartment. Plenty powerful enough for a 12&#x27;x12&#x27; bedroom and larger living room. My place smells amazing. The three light options are nice. If I want to sleep with it in the room, I just place something dark over the power light, which is pretty bright. Easy problem to fix.</li>
    <li> Love it! Diffuses my Young Living oils😍</li>
    <li> This is a great little product. It is a nice oil diffuser that emits a cool little mist. The lights add a soothing effect to my room.</li>
    <li> I really like this diffuser. I just wish it would scent a larger room.</li>
    <li> Using it daily with my essential oils. It is working perfectly thus far.</li>
    <li> Love mine, so bought this one as a gift.</li>
    <li> It works great! Some diffusers the mist barely comes out but not this one, clouds come out. Another nice feature is you can turn the light off if you use while sleeping. It&#x27;s also very easy to put water in and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Love it, no problems, works great.</li>
    <li> Very timely shipping.  Great product!</li>
    <li> So in love with this diffuser! Smells up the whole house and so pretty to watch...loving  it!</li>
    <li> Love this aromatheraphy which has different setting of light. This product doesn&#x27;t include essential oils, so you can use your preferred oil kits. This aromatherapy is better than a burning candles. but remember to use filtered water or distilled water, so the water won&#x27;t build sediments on it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use just add water and few drops of you essential oil and press the button! and enjoy it...</li>
    <li> I always wanted one of these and saw this had good reviews so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. This thing is awesome! Love the changing colors and ability to choose a favorite and it turning off automatically when water runs out is very nice. This is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Good quality product and cool design.  Love the changing colored lights and the ability to turn on favorite color light and to turn light off completely for the perfect &amp;#34;ambience.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest and unbaised opinion. I love this. This thing can be used for so many purposes depending on which essentila oil you pick: my son has some problems with congestion: so I drip couple of drops of Ecaliptus Oil in the diffuser and it helps him breath so much better, Lavander Oil has relaxation effect and so on. Now back to this diffuser itself: I love the slick design,you can literally put it on any flat surface and it will look good and do good. A great plus is the LED soft mood Color Changing Lighting: beautiful interchanging colors: you can just fix it on one color or turn it off, but I like when it&#x27;s all the colors: beautiful and it can surf like a night light... The diffuser comes with easy to read instruction, which tells you how much water to add and how to operate it. Would definitely reccomend this one!</li>
    <li> It is a high quality diffuser. It lights up, It changes colors. There is no on/off mode for light. The light does not bother me at night. Actually it works a night light for me at night. The ZAQ Dew multi color litemist Aromatherapy can be used for headache, migraine, sinus and allergy. I get allergy when I get up in the morning. I starts sneezing and runny nose. I stay in my bedroom where I use this diffuser and it calms down my allergy. This diffuser can be used with any essential oil for aromatherapy. It is great for living room, bedroom, spa or any place to have nice and soothing effect in the environment. When I was not using the diffuser I used to wake up with so dry skin even though I moisturizer at night, but now due the essential oil and mist, my skin is soft and moisturize in the morning too. I feel so relaxed when I turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the diffuser is awesome. It is made with plastic but the plastic is not cheap at all. It is such a decent diffuser it gives my bedroom an elegant look.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this diffuser it is great for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to get this diffuser as part of a promotion in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a super nice diffuser. very easy to use and looks great in any room. We diffuse oils a lot and needed a second diffuser so I was happy when I found this one. It looks very pretty on the shelf and I got many compliments on it ever since we received it.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to someone with six grown children and LOTS  of other relatives, all of whom have commented very positively and said that they want one.  It works well and looks pretty, and honestly, I want one, too!</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser! So easy to clean and makes my apartment smell wonderful! When I had the flu, it was the only thing that kept me from coughing all day when I added my special blend essential oils.</li>
    <li> Works so well. It has a change color mode and an option to turn the color down. Fills the room with whatever oil scent you put in it and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This little diffuser is perfect for my rather small room. I love the option to turn the light off, but I do find that the blue power light is pretty bright. It looks nice in my room and is a great price. I only gave it 4 stars because of how bright the power light is. I have to cover it with something to keep the room dark. Other than that, I love it.</li>
    <li> Great to get rid of the diaper smell.  Very easy to operate and it smells good.</li>
    <li> I love this vaporizer. It&#x27;s quiet, and small allowing you to place it anywhere. I love the changing lights. It&#x27;s really relaxing. I use lavender oils in it to help lull me to sleep. I&#x27;m considering getting a second one for another room in my house. OH and did I mention it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this in March 2015 and I actually loved it. However, it no longer works, and it&#x27;s only August 2015, so I&#x27;m not sure if that is normal that you only get about 5 months of regular use. But, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $40 for a few months.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected, I love that it turns itself off when empty.</li>
    <li> We have been pleased with the performance of this diffuser.</li>
    <li> Such an awesome diffuser! The light is kinda bright for the button but just put some black tape and bam! Easily fall asleep. Never have any problems with it.</li>
    <li> It works just as I had hoped it would.  I am very pleased and so is my husband.  My mother came over and liked it so much she also bought one for her house and loves it.</li>
    <li> I received this lovely diffuser for Christmas.  It is so easy to use!  It comes with a little measuring cup for the water which makes putting 80 ml in a breeze.  Essentially you just lift the top, add 80 ml. of water and 3-5 drops of essential oils, replace the top, and press the button.  It is so quiet. It runs for about 4 hours before shutting off.  We&#x27;ve been putting this in my 6 year old sons room at night with a little lavendar in it.  He loves the changing color setting and it is very soothing for him.  He has fallen asleep much more quickly than before.  I highly recommend this quality diffuser!</li>
    <li> I love it! It works great:)</li>
    <li> Again, I like very much, Decided I wanted one in black, also.</li>
    <li> Fabulous! I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to get a diffuser. Automatic shut off is awesome such a great feature &amp; the ability to have 3 settings for light vs no light also nice. It is very quiet but has a soothing very silent dripping noise of the water moving - highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser, it works well, cleans well but yes, it definitely still shines a lot of light even with the light off. Plus, this is a slide off hazard. The bottom of it is designed to please the eye but you bump it a little bit and it slides around easily which is inconvenient and not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably end up getting a different design next time.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, but they work.  Half the price of my Young Living Diffuser.  I like the little pitcher it comes with.</li>
    <li> For the price, this diffuser is the best on the market. Before we had a cheaper one that stopped working within a few weeks. This one, however, is way better; it runs all day (provided you refill it regularly), and it&#x27;s ready to go the next day without fail. We like it so much we just bought two more.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; diffusers. This one was very weak and barely diffused anything. I was hoping to save some money by buying a cheaper diffuser, but once again I was reminded...you get what you pay for. The lights were pretty though, but it didn&#x27;t produce much scent even in a small room with the door closed.</li>
    <li> It works great, the colors are soothing, and it is very quiet.</li>
    <li> Love this item. It enhances the ambiance  of any room and transmits a peaceful environment . Depending on the oils can improve your mood and possibly your health. Also a great gift. I vote spend on this!🙏</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to diffused oils so I cannot offer comparisons as this is my first diffuser.  However, I love the changing colors and the auto shutoff feature as I run this at night as I lay down and like that it shuts off when the water goes out.  It is quiet and I adore the aromas!</li>
