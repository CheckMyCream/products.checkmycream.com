      <li>The brush does an excellent job of adding length without creating clumps -- and I cannot STAND clumpy mascara.  </li>

      <li>It makes my lashes look great without clogging them or flaking.</li>
      <li>Great coverage and wear.</li>
      <li>about lol</li>
      <li>Is great for adding length, but is not ment to add volume.</li>
      <li>This is honestly the best mascara for length I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>THIS IS REALLY GREAT MASCARA.</li>
      <li>A great buy</li>
      <li>It also comes off very easily too!</li>
      <li>I recommended it to my sister in law (who has insanely gorgeous lashes) and this is all she uses now.</li>
      <li>Gives good fullness and length</li>
      <li>I had heard good things about it, and let me tell you, they weren&#x27;t kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>one of the originals- wins best mascara almost every year,</li>
      <li>I absolutly love this mascara!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way better than Lash Blast Length!</li>
      <li>I love this mascara!</li>
      <li>THE LENGTH IS JUST GREAT AND LOOKS JUST FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>this is an amazing mascara.  </li>
      <li>and you should have amazing results.</li>
      <li>so it was a nice</li>
      <li>I really liked this stuff.</li>
      <li>HOW NICE I LOOKED</li>
      <li>Nice mascara that does not clump.</li>
      <li>THAT YOU USE WITH YOUR OWN MASCARA.</li>
      <li>I know that Younique is really popular, but I refuse to spend $30 on mascara that I have to replace every 2 months b/c</li>
      <li>Instead I would suggest The Colossal Volum&#x27; Express (in the yellow tube) and Lash Sensational, both of which are very great and very impressive.</li>
      <li>This is an awesome product that I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>but length is its strong point for sure!</li>
      <li>If I want added volume I just put a voluminous mascara on top.</li>
      <li>first then I use a mascara for volume and my lashes look amazing!</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite mascaras of all time.  </li>
      <li>I love it and would tell friends about it.  </li>
      <li>I love how this mascara applies.  </li>
      <li>YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>Was very excited to see it here.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara and it makes my short fine eyelashes look great!</li>
      <li>I would recommend to just go from root to tip in nice quick and light movements until you like how that eye looks (</li>
      <li>/&gt;-comes off easily with makeup remover&lt;br</li>
      <li>But not too easily</li>
      <li>easy to apply, no clumping, and doesn&#x27;t flake off throughout the day.</li>
      <li>But as of right now would highly recommend, packaged great, came fast and just a really good product.</li>
      <li>When there are no fibers the mascara is fine- lasts all day with no flaking or smearing, and removes easily with soap and water or makeup remover cloth.  </li>
      <li>I stuck with this mascara for a while because I liked the length, but after a month of using it, I noticed my eyelashes were much, much shorter and sparser, so</li>
      <li>This mascara is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This has worked the best for me in every mascara I use, I notice that trying to put a layer on dried mascara can just make thing clumpy.</li>
      <li>I am definitely going to keep buying mascara from them, whether this kind or trying another one of theirs!</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this mascara</li>
      <li>At first putting this product on, I figured it didn&#x27;t really lengthen my eyelashes but just made them look amazing.</li>
      <li>The only good thing I can think of is it didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s alike flaky, not bad at all tho..</li>
      <li>My lashes are medium length, and I typically use a volumizing mascara, but for a while I was really into finding the perfect lengthening mascara.  </li>
      <li>If you want a super lengthening mascara that conditions your lashes instead of breaking them off, go to sephora and get Imju Fiberwig.</li>
      <li>I have wiped the brush off and redipped into the tube, and sometimes more visible chunks if fiber come out, and sometimes it seems normal.  </li>
      <li>My lashes were long, no clumps, added a surprising amount of volume for a lengthening mascara.</li>
      <li>That is actually a good thing because mascara isn&#x27;t supposed to be used for a long period anyway.</li>
      <li>but Maybelline makes far better mascara&#x27;s than this one,  </li>
      <li>I feel like the hype was fixed because this mascara is nowhere near as good as people (and magazines) have been saying.</li>
      <li>I already have long lashes but these make them ridiculously long and looking great!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s a good basic with a high reputation.</li>
      <li>I figured it was the right time to try.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a while and until the time when mascara usually expires, it was a great product.  </li>
      <li>brush wasn&#x27;t very impressive- very long, with very spaced out bristles, which weren&#x27;t able to properly separate and lift the individual lashes while applying.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time purchasing this mascara.  </li>
      <li>meaning put on as many layers as you want at that time) and then move on to the next eye.</li>
      <li>inexpensive mascara that works exactly as it should.</li>
      <li>The effect is only ok, and that&#x27;s if you use an eyelash comb.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many, and this is the only one that does not disappoint.</li>
      <li>The only reason it&#x27;s getting 4 stars and not 5 is because I prefer a bit more volume along with the length.</li>
      <li>it dries out so quickly in the high desert.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I have never written a review for any other beauty product because nothing every amazed me.</li>
      <li>This is definitely a close second to my favorite, the original Lash Blast by Cover Girl.</li>
      <li>I know that even if it doesn&#x27;t exactly do what it promised, it will still be a decent quality of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do have very oily eyelids, so finding good eye makeup is hard for me.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>It really does add length to your eye lashes, not so much thickness</li>
      <li>very natural.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;-doesn&#x27;t thicken as much as it could.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find much in the way of &amp;#34;Illegal Length Fiber Extensions&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>cons: I really can&#x27;t think of any.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>and I could really notice the difference in length.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- spreads very well and evenly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its gives me more length than any other mascara i have ever used.</li>
      <li>It didnt&#x27; clump often, and when it did it was never in a particularly unattractive, one eyelash on the eye way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I highly encourage people to keep this in mind when considering this mascara.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I decided to get this I was so so so worried it would be like one of the negative reviews I read... But it came in today, I put it on and I love it!!! It really does add length to your eye lashes, not so much thickness but length is its strong point for sure! I have real sensitive eyes and it hasn&#x27;t messed with my eyes at all so far. The only reason I&#x27;m docking a star is cuz it gives very little thickness and it&#x27;s alike flaky, not bad at all tho.. Trust me I&#x27;ve had mascara that had flaked horribly and this one is nothing compared to them. I&#x27;m talking about maybe a few flakes after a few hours a wear... But also guys this is only day one trail one.. So, if my opinion changes thru out the next couple of weeks, I will add on to this review.. But as of right now would highly recommend, packaged great, came fast and just a really good product. It came as it was described, looks like picture, and does what it says it will do.. And it&#x27;s took alot of time money and products to find one I could say that about lol</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. Purchased as a replacement for a different Mabelline mascara that I could no longer find. Very happy, beautiful eyelashes, no clumping. Beautiful, just as I have come to expect with all my mabelline products.</li>
    <li> I saw this mascara in a clearance bin at Target for about $2, so I thought what the heck. Might as well try it. I had heard good things about it, and let me tell you, they weren&#x27;t kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-INSANE length&lt;br /&gt;-no, really.&lt;br /&gt;-INSANE.&lt;br /&gt;-good pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;-lasts a long time without being waterproof&lt;br /&gt;-comes off easily with makeup remover&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-flakes a bit&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t thicken as much as it could.</li>
    <li> Nice mascara that does not clump. It makes lashes look naturally longer and somewhat  fuller. I really like this product, I will continue to purchase even though it tends to dry out fast. That is actually a good thing because mascara isn&#x27;t supposed to be used for a long period anyway. This causes me to change it out regularly.</li>
    <li> Is great for adding length, but is not ment to add volume. I use this mascara first then I use a mascara for volume and my lashes look amazing!</li>
    <li> this is an amazing mascara.  I&#x27;ve had it for a while and until the time when mascara usually expires, it was a great product.  It made my lashes far longer (I could see a huge visible difference when I washed it off at night,) and it was as dark as expected.  It didnt&#x27; clump often, and when it did it was never in a particularly unattractive, one eyelash on the eye way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also never came off as spidery even when I applied a lot of it.  A great buy and it never flaked.</li>
    <li> It was hard to wash off with facial cleanser. And it left me looking with a smudge of dark shadows under my eyes after the rinse. Nothing that toner can&#x27;t remove and eye cream, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a hot day, it would leave black smudges around my eyes. I do have very oily eyelids, so finding good eye makeup is hard for me. Didn&#x27;t flake, so that&#x27;s a plus. Extended my lashes, but no volume at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a pass.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this mascara but when I received it is was opened and used!!! Gross so I ended up throwing it away because I was afraid to use it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. I really like this mascara.</li>
    <li> I have always bought this brand locally but thought I would try buying it via prime to save a little money. Same exact product as in the drug store! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because it always goes on a little heavier when I first open it. Great for the price!</li>
    <li> I really liked this stuff. My lashes were long, no clumps, added a surprising amount of volume for a lengthening mascara. It&#x27;s way better than Lash Blast Length! I&#x27;m impressed with this one. I recommended it to my sister in law (who has insanely gorgeous lashes) and this is all she uses now. The only reason it&#x27;s getting 4 stars and not 5 is because I prefer a bit more volume along with the length. This is definitely a close second to my favorite, the original Lash Blast by Cover Girl. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever...ever!  I&#x27;ve tried so many, and this is the only one that does not disappoint. No clumping, no flaking, the brush is perfect for this formula - separates and elongates each lash.</li>
    <li> I am a Asian who has very short and thin eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;This product has been the best mascara in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- insane length.&lt;br /&gt;- very natural.&lt;br /&gt;- spreads very well and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;- waterproof&lt;br /&gt;- lasts long&lt;br /&gt;- light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-little clumps.&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t thicken.&lt;br /&gt;-need oil based eye remover to wash it off. it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
    <li> Bleh. Lengthened my lashes a bit, but definately not 4mm or whatever the stupid commercials claim! I thought this was going to be a tubing type mascara and it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s clumpy and gives the spider lashes look. Very cheap feeling packaging, and the mascara dried out within just a few uses (even with the cap on tight). It was also pretty expensive for a drugstore mascara. The only good thing I can think of is it didn&#x27;t smudge. Would not buy again and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been thinking about this product for a while.  My lashes are medium length, and I typically use a volumizing mascara, but for a while I was really into finding the perfect lengthening mascara.  When I saw this in Marshalls for about 4 bucks I figured it was the right time to try.  I only used this two times but after the second time, into the trash it went.  It did not create dramatic length and I&#x27;m not really sure it lengthened at all; I&#x27;ve had better results from volumizing products.  But what really made me dislike the product was that both times I used it, what I&#x27;m assuming was a fiber got into my eye and caused a really sharp pain.  I couldn&#x27;t see the fiber and it was very difficult to remove the invisible terrorist without ruining my eye makeup, but eventually it came out.  About the only thing I liked from this product was that it was a glossy black, something which I&#x27;m not used to, so it was a nice change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the result of this mascara (for me at least) was an everyday look, and there certainly wasn&#x27;t any length.  Because both times I used it I had fibers fall into my eyes and cause pain, I highly encourage people to keep this in mind when considering this mascara.  This is one of the worst Maybelline mascaras I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried nearly all of them) and I do not recommend.  Instead I would suggest The Colossal Volum&#x27; Express (in the yellow tube) and Lash Sensational, both of which are very great and very impressive.</li>
    <li> This stuff clumps like crazy.  I had to throw it out after only using it two times.  I would definitely not recommend it!</li>
    <li> inexpensive mascara that works exactly as it should. easy to apply, no clumping, and doesn&#x27;t flake off throughout the day. makes my lashes look super long.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I have never written a review for any other beauty product because nothing every amazed me. Until now. At first putting this product on, I figured it didn&#x27;t really lengthen my eyelashes but just made them look amazing. Today, I had some of the mascara on part of my lashes and none on the other part and I could really notice the difference in length. I already have long lashes but these make them ridiculously long and looking great! Once you use it for about a month, it does start to get clumpy but that&#x27;s  like any drug store mascara, at least the other types I&#x27;ve had. I would recommend to just go from root to tip in nice quick and light movements until you like how that eye looks (meaning put on as many layers as you want at that time) and then move on to the next eye. This has worked the best for me in every mascara I use, I notice that trying to put a layer on dried mascara can just make thing clumpy. Great product though! I am definitely going to keep buying mascara from them, whether this kind or trying another one of theirs! It also comes off very easily too! But not too easily so you look like a raccoon every time it rains!</li>
    <li> This product was NOT what I expected! It did not lengthen my lashes at all. Simply did the job of a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; mascara. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing this mascara.  I am no stranger to lengthening mascara, but I have never seen anything like this product.  It has a LOT of different fibers in it- so much that at times it seems like the applicator has been dipped into a used vacuum cleaner bag.  There are all manner if bits in the mascara.  I have wiped the brush off and redipped into the tube, and sometimes more visible chunks if fiber come out, and sometimes it seems normal.  The long fibers can make one eyelash look twice as long as the rest...not exactly the look I am going for.  When there are no fibers the mascara is fine- lasts all day with no flaking or smearing, and removes easily with soap and water or makeup remover cloth.  I won&#x27;t buy this variety again.</li>
    <li> I had to glue the mascara back into the package.  It seems like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;old product&amp;#34;.  I won&#x27;t buy mascara online again.</li>
    <li> This is honestly the best mascara for length I&#x27;ve ever used. If I want added volume I just put a voluminous mascara on top. It builds well and doesn&#x27;t clump. The only bad thing is that it runs out quick. I&#x27;ve attached a before and after picture.</li>
    <li> Not much different than all other Maybelline mascaras.  I didn&#x27;t find much in the way of &amp;#34;Illegal Length Fiber Extensions&amp;#34;.  The brush makes it difficult to apply to lower lashes, even when turning it perpendicular to them.  I will definitely NOT be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> Maybelline is usually my go to brand for mascara.  Over the years I&#x27;ve bought a king&#x27;s ransom of their new lines, mainly bc I know that even if it doesn&#x27;t exactly do what it promised, it will still be a decent quality of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Illegal Lengths was the exception to that rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush wasn&#x27;t very impressive- very long, with very spaced out bristles, which weren&#x27;t able to properly separate and lift the individual lashes while applying.  The result was a lot of clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what happened here, but Maybelline makes far better mascara&#x27;s than this one,  Their pink tube- one of the originals- wins best mascara almost every year, so it&#x27;s a good basic with a high reputation. Or try one of the others, just remember to skip this stuff.</li>
    <li> I used this mascara years ago when it was in a different container and hated when it was discontinued. Was very excited to see it here. It makes my lashes look great without clogging them or flaking. As for the length extension ability I don&#x27;t know as I already have extremely long lashes. However it does make my lashes pop on my eyes!</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this mascara! Its gives me more length than any other mascara i have ever used. You can get extremely long lashes by doing many coats, waiting for each coat to dry before applying the next.One thing i don&#x27;t like about it, is it doesn&#x27;t give a lot of volume. I recomend using another mascara that promises volume along with this one and you should have amazing results.</li>
    <li> This mascara is fantastic. I&#x27;ve worn it for years and have tried other brands as well. I always come back to this particular one. When wearing it, I&#x27;m often asked if I use a brand name prescription eyelash enhancer.</li>
    <li> I feel like the hype was fixed because this mascara is nowhere near as good as people (and magazines) have been saying. The lengthening is alright, as is expected from a mascara with fibers, but the formula is clumpy and difficult to work with. The effect is only ok, and that&#x27;s if you use an eyelash comb. I stuck with this mascara for a while because I liked the length, but after a month of using it, I noticed my eyelashes were much, much shorter and sparser, so I can conclude that the formula is very harsh on lashes. Even my friends and family noticed my lashes were thin and short, when before they were long and lush. I had to switch to a mascara that included conditioning properties (eyeko skinny brush mascara). If you want a super lengthening mascara that conditions your lashes instead of breaking them off, go to sephora and get Imju Fiberwig. More expensive, yes, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Prior to using this , i always got they&#x27;re real by benefit. Thats almost $30! This is cheaper and SAME results! Wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> Gives good fullness and length</li>
    <li> The product does as it claims. There are tiny fibers in the mascara solution that cling to your lashes to visibly lengthen them. The solution does not easily dry out and does not clump. I found that after wearing it for a few hours it does get a little flaky and I will have some fall out by the end of the day. Not a huge deal, but it&#x27;s not fun if you get one of those fibers in your eye.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and it makes my short fine eyelashes look great!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I had used the same mascara for almost 25 years, but I have now switched to Maybelline Illegal Length and will never go back to my old brand. This is a &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; mascara that works really well and is actually affordable. I know that Younique is really popular, but I refuse to spend $30 on mascara that I have to replace every 2 months b/c it dries out so quickly in the high desert. Maybelline Illegal Length fits my budget and makes my lashes look really long. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is nothing like it advertises.  It does not add a thicker look nor does it spread evenly.  If you use it you will have to apply two coats and not allowing the first coat to dry as it will then clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to receive the product earlier then promised, but then disappointed that it is not at all as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and wear. Does not irritate the eyes.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras of all time.  Truly a &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: I love how this mascara applies.  The brush does an excellent job of adding length without creating clumps -- and I cannot STAND clumpy mascara.  I would much rather have a less voluminous look than have clumps, but this adds the right amount of volume.  It definitely adds length -- perhaps not to a &amp;#34;falsies&amp;#34; level effect, but pretty close.  Obviously that depends on the length of your lashes in the first place, but this will add a few millimeters.  The color and consistency are excellent also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons: I really can&#x27;t think of any.  This is an awesome product that I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> THIS IS REALLY GREAT MASCARA. THE LENGTH IS JUST GREAT AND LOOKS JUST FANTASTIC. I WAS GOING TO GET THE EXTRA FIBERS THAT YOU USE WITH YOUR OWN MASCARA. I WAS NOT SURE I COULD STOP RUBBING MY EYES.  THANKFULLY I ORDERED THIS, I GOT TONS OF COMMENTS ON HOW NICE I LOOKED AND DID I DO SOMETHING NEW?  TRY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I love it and would tell friends about it.  I will get more lately.  I have nothing else to say.</li>
