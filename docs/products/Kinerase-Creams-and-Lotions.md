<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seems to help reduce wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Kinerase moisturizer for years and I love it.  But this eye cream doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a month and I see no difference over just using the regular facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF, takes very little, lasts forever. HIGH QUALITY</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the Kinerase line by my dermatologist.  She recommended it for the small moles that were beginning to form under my eyes and on my checks.  From that point on, I have trusted this line of lotions for all of my skin needs.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream, good results. Kinerase products are top quality and have been in the skincare business for a long time! I see a difference every time I use it..</li>
    <li> Really helps fight the development of dry eye lid and eye area crinkles. Not too greasy, so I can soon put on makeup after application. As a busy worker mom with early hours, I really appreciate this. I&#x27;m a 50-something year old woman.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a pea-size of this over my whole face for years. It&#x27;s like a good night&#x27;s sleep in a bottle. Worth every penny and a less expensive but I find more effective option than other Kinerase whole face products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Kinerase products for over 10 years. They were recommended by a Dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years and love it!  I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; with thin skin under my eyes.  This cream is very hydrating and makes my under eyes look great even without makeup.  A little goes a long way, so the product lasts several months - definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> One of the best eye creams I ever had.......Took puffiness away from my eyes after one application.  Another benefit is to use a tiny amount also around your lips which leaves them smooth and soft............Great product and great price through Amazon because it&#x27;s about 15 dollars more in the store.........................Will definitely purchase again.................</li>
    <li> I have been using Kinerase Products for many years, I would never use any other product on my skin, this product really works.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kinerase Cream for several years but this is the first time I have tried the eye cream. I was not disappointed! lightweight, not greasy, it feels great on. I have only been using it for 3 weeks but can say I will certainly be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month didn&#x27;t notice a difference in anything, I am 27 years old so I use kinerase for wrinkle prevention.. I think I&#x27;m gonna go for a least expensive product next time</li>
    <li> This product really works to easy out unwanted lines and blemishes from the skin surrounding the eyes. The price is right for a great product.</li>
    <li> Like how it feels on my skin. I&#x27;m 27 without under eye bags or no visible wrinkles so I don&#x27;t know how we&#x27;ll it works in these aspects. The dark under eyes seem to have gotten better though.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand on my face an eyes for years and still love it.  Have tried others in between, but keep going back to Kinerase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  I&#x27;m 38 years old and compared to my peers, I don&#x27;t have any eye wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This product has helped considerably in reducing under eye darkness.  I only use it once a day and probably would have had quicker results if I used it twice a day.  It reduces wrinkles and keeps the under eye area moist.  It has helped in reducing puffiness but I suspect this is an allergy related and age related condition that is difficult to remedy.</li>
    <li> I used LaPrarie products for many years and still use some.  It is an excellent brand but very expensive.  I tried Kinerase Eye Cream about three years ago and find it every bit as good.  My skin is combination.  Perhaps it may not be as good for someone with extremely dry skin.  But it may.  I like the tube which keeps the product free of contamination although it can be a bit difficult to get the last little bit out of the tube.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it worked great easy to use this is her first time using this product she wlllkeep buying this product</li>
    <li> Very nourishing under eye cream, that is not greasy. I have very sensitive skin, and this agrees with my aging skin.</li>

    <li> I have been using this one for years.  It really seems to work on crepey skin under and around they eye.  Smooths out fine lines and wrinkles and also helps diminish circles.</li>
    <li> Try it for more than a month, nothing happen to my fine lines. Bought it because of the good reviews, quite disapointed.</li>
    <li> this product is great it makes your skin look great and it does not make you break out</li>
    <li> Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;I see a great difference around my eyes..&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend  Kinerase products to all women!!&lt;br /&gt;No one can guess my age!!</li>
    <li> Use for years starting when I was 40 years old , also use lotion.  However use other products along each of those serve different purposes. Hypoallergenic if you have sensetive skin.</li>
    <li> The smell is normal I am not gonna return this item and I will buy it again thanks</li>
