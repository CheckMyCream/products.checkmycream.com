      <li>I try to avoid certain chemicals in soaps, I find this soap fantastic for my kids skin as well as the amount you get for the price, you just can&#x27;t beat it!!!  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;re always looking for good, cheap, paraben/pthalate-free soap that is also shampoo (tall order, right?!).  </li>
      <li>Not only smells amazing, I feel great about the products I am using on their skin.</li>
      <li>Gentle on skin and yet pleasantly scented.</li>
      <li>It is gentle, no tears, and it has a really pleasant lavender scent.</li>
      <li>Purchased for my kiddos, love that it&#x27;s an all in one type deal (shampoo, body wash, bubblebath) &amp; the fragrance was fabulous.</li>
      <li>Makes good bubbles and is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful, tear free, all natural and leaves their skin nice &amp; soft.</li>
      <li>I love this soap because it has a great safe rating frok ewg alot less chemicals than most stuff u buy at the store</li>

      <li>It has a nice lavender scent and suds up really well.  </li>
      <li>All the important things are covered.</li>
      <li>Love this product so far!! :-)</li>
      <li>Significantly cheaper on Amazon - so we buy this &amp; matching lotion for the family.</li>
      <li>I feel clean.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, all organic incredients, it&#x27;s thick, it makes great lather, and you get a TON for the price.</li>
      <li>Mainly for the fact that it is all Cruelty free, paraben free, polysorbate free, disodium EDTA free, gluten free, sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate free and non-GMO modified.</li>
      <li>When the product arrived at the house it was 3/4 full</li>
      <li>Luckily, there was a plastic bag around it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for my baby&#x27;s hair and for my son&#x27;s short hair, but it isn&#x27;t as great for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair - that requires a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it comes in a larger size than most and the whole family can use and enjoy without having to buy 3 separate types</li>
      <li>It was worth the money &amp;</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because while I love the smell of the soap in the bottle, as soon as I am lathering on my body, it smells different....and not a smell that I enjoy.</li>
      <li>This company contacted me right away and made it right with me.</li>
      <li>the ingredients are organic and the price is right.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s easy for my 4 year old to use, but the product arrives damaged every time I order a bottle.</li>
      <li>My children have sensitive skin &amp; easily rash out.</li>
      <li>Just tried this for the first time tonight.</li>
      <li>I really like the product!</li>
      <li>We try to make sure that my younger siblings don&#x27;t use any chemicals on their bodies so we try to buy organic hand soaps, chemical-free laundry detergents, and whatnot</li>
      <li>Give it a try if you need to de-stress ;)</li>
      <li>Thanks again!</li>
      <li>I bought this product for my kids recently and I love it.</li>
      <li>We love it and it&#x27;s going to last a looong time!</li>
      <li>This is my second order of this huge bottle of soap.  </li>
      <li>I really like this soap along with my family.  </li>
      <li>the smell is fresh and natural.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>So that shows how much we use it.  </li>
      <li>Not a lot of companies really care these days.</li>
      <li>I use this mostly for body soap since I have other shampoos for my kids based on their hair types (which seems nuts at ages 3 and 5 that I have figured out their &#x27;hair type&#x27; . . . )  </li>
      <li>I washed my hair with it and it left my hair soft and easy to comb.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I am not a huge fan of the smell; it&#x27;s not horrible</li>
      <li>the bottle is on the large side, plus it&#x27;s free of all the harsh stuff.</li>
      <li>Everytime I get a new product for my son, I use it myself.</li>
      <li>however, I find the Chamomile essential oil really does relax me and make me sleep better, so I find myself coming back to this one when I really need to wind down for the night.</li>
      <li>It had spilled all over inside of the packaging and was a huge mess.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be tear-free because it&#x27;s all natural, and it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>It really stings eyes, and I&#x27;ll definitely not order it again.</li>
      <li>One of my daughters has sensitive skin, but this soap does not cause irritation.</li>
      <li>I much prefer the French Lavender EO fragrance over this one...</li>
      <li>Ordered this for my 4 year old son.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought it just for my little kids (who often use my shower)</li>
      <li>but I quickly started using it myself as my everyday body soap.  </li>
      <li>I usually have very dry skin, but this stuff makes my skin feel soft and healthy, especially if I follow up with EO French Lavender lotion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is not Tear Free shampoo, so watch out for your kids.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is weak as well...</li>

    <li> My son even likes the smell, and that he can use just one product and it doesn&#x27;t hurt his eyes.  I like that it&#x27;s safe and smells nice too, and that he uses it!</li>
    <li> Its Ok, I dont know why so many people had good review for this soap.&lt;br /&gt;It is not Tear Free shampoo, so watch out for your kids.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is weak as well... look for some other product.</li>
    <li> We try to make sure that my younger siblings don&#x27;t use any chemicals on their bodies so we try to buy organic hand soaps, chemical-free laundry detergents, and whatnot and we love this brand! This lavender smell is so relaxing! I think it&#x27;s perfect for any kid&#x27;s nighttime bath! Seriously relaxing smell!</li>
    <li> Love love love this soap.  I try to avoid certain chemicals in soaps, I find this soap fantastic for my kids skin as well as the amount you get for the price, you just can&#x27;t beat it!!!  It even works as bubble bath as well.</li>
    <li> When the product arrived at the house it was 3/4 full</li>
    <li> I am not a kid. But I use this. I much prefer the French Lavender EO fragrance over this one... however, I find the Chamomile essential oil really does relax me and make me sleep better, so I find myself coming back to this one when I really need to wind down for the night. I usually have very dry skin, but this stuff makes my skin feel soft and healthy, especially if I follow up with EO French Lavender lotion. Give it a try if you need to de-stress ;)</li>
    <li> i love all of the products from this brand.  the ingredients are organic and the price is right.  the smell is fresh and natural.  great for kids or adults.</li>
    <li> This is the best kids soap, and adults, I have ever found. Great price and great product.  Not many quality soap products have a pump!</li>
    <li> Smells good and got a good rating on skin-deep.com, but it doesn&#x27;t make and keep the best bubbles.</li>
    <li> Great soap, well rated on ewg website!  It did dry out my daughter&#x27;s cheeks, so can&#x27;t give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re always looking for good, cheap, paraben/pthalate-free soap that is also shampoo (tall order, right?!).  The foaming Seventh Generation one is completely useless.  This one is awesome!  We love it and it&#x27;s going to last a looong time!</li>
    <li> I really like this soap along with my family.  Lathers well, not too drying, I feel clean. All the important things are covered. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because while I love the smell of the soap in the bottle, as soon as I am lathering on my body, it smells different....and not a smell that I enjoy. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just not what I want. Anyway, I am going to try the other scent instead next time.</li>
    <li> Great company! Not a lot of companies really care these days. I ordered this product and it came damaged. It had spilled all over inside of the packaging and was a huge mess. This company contacted me right away and made it right with me. VITA4LESS did an outstanding job communicating and making the situation better for me. I appreciate their efforts and will continue to always do business with them. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and body wash!</li>
    <li> My only issue was that it leaked.  Luckily, there was a plastic bag around it.  I really like the product!</li>
    <li> I use this mostly for body soap since I have other shampoos for my kids based on their hair types (which seems nuts at ages 3 and 5 that I have figured out their &#x27;hair type&#x27; . . . )  The Lavender scent is subtle and it is the right balance of thick and thin so that you don&#x27;t feel like you are wasting product - I have tried some that are too watery and not worth the effort or money.</li>
    <li> This soap is not tear-free and we didn&#x27;t realize it - so, we just use it for the body, and not for the hair.</li>
    <li> I love this soap because it has a great safe rating frok ewg alot less chemicals than most stuff u buy at the store and it can be used as shampoo and body wash and it smells very nice</li>
    <li> Love this soap! Super gentle and great smell!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is really nice! It is gentle, no tears, and it has a really pleasant lavender scent. My kids love it!</li>
    <li> Big mommy fail! I thought this would be tear-free because it&#x27;s all natural, and it&#x27;s not. It really stings eyes, and I&#x27;ll definitely not order it again. Too bad, because I liked it for other reasons.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, all organic incredients, it&#x27;s thick, it makes great lather, and you get a TON for the price. Everytime I get a new product for my son, I use it myself. I washed my hair with it and it left my hair soft and easy to comb. I wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday on my hair but this is a product is designed for kids, not as greasy adult. lol. Anyway, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells great and is very gentle. I even used it and my hair!</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin smells good too.</li>
    <li> Love this soap for my kids - works great for bubbles, hair &amp; body, and smells great.  I have the Orange one, and can&#x27;t wait to try the Coconut!  Hopefully Amazon will carry the Coconut one themselves soon, or offer all of these via subscribe &amp; save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, it&#x27;s a BIG bottle, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t contain any typical harsh ingredients like so many other shampoos &amp; soaps.</li>
    <li> I love this soap for my kids. It smells heavenly and I don&#x27;t worry about what&#x27;s in it - it is leaps and bounds better than all of those kids&#x27; products you&#x27;ll find at the store. It&#x27;s great for my baby&#x27;s hair and for my son&#x27;s short hair, but it isn&#x27;t as great for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair - that requires a shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s perfect as a soap for all three!</li>
    <li> Great scent, gentle to us on kids of all ages (adults too). Makes good bubbles and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of the smell; it&#x27;s not horrible but it&#x27;s ok. It is definately not like the fragrant store brand lavender but like the actual lavender (if that makes sense). It has a good lather and I am glad it does not have any harmful chemicals in it but I will choose a different scent next time.</li>
    <li> Just tried this for the first time tonight. Purchased for my kiddos, love that it&#x27;s an all in one type deal (shampoo, body wash, bubblebath) &amp; the fragrance was fabulous. Both of my children loved it. It was worth the money &amp; the bottle is on the large side, plus it&#x27;s free of all the harsh stuff. Love this product so far!! :-)</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this huge bottle of soap.  So that shows how much we use it.  I originally bought it just for my little kids (who often use my shower) but I quickly started using it myself as my everyday body soap.  The lavender scent is lovely and light and it&#x27;s so quick to just pump out what you need.  We will continue to use this as our family go-to body soap!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my kids recently and I love it. Not only smells amazing, I feel great about the products I am using on their skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Doesn&#x27;t last after getting out of the shower.</li>
    <li> It smells good and light. One of my daughters has sensitive skin, but this soap does not cause irritation. I also use it for body, but not for head. I would need to apply a lot of it to wash my hair.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff. The lavender is the best scent in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap. The lavender and the orange smell so good. I can use it on my son for bath time, then myself for my bath!</li>
    <li> Gentle on skin and yet pleasantly scented. My daughter and I both love it. I love the fact that it comes in a larger size than most and the whole family can use and enjoy without having to buy 3 separate types</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my 4 year old son.  Mainly for the fact that it is all Cruelty free, paraben free, polysorbate free, disodium EDTA free, gluten free, sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate free and non-GMO modified. And it&#x27;s MADE IN THE USA!!!!  We love it!!  It has a nice lavender scent and suds up really well.  We also ordered the lotion and love that as well.</li>
    <li> I like the soap, it&#x27;s easy for my 4 year old to use, but the product arrives damaged every time I order a bottle. About a quarter of the soap is spilled in the box by the time it arrives.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. My children have sensitive skin &amp; easily rash out. We found this at a local organic chain store &amp; it&#x27;s perfect. Smells wonderful, tear free, all natural and leaves their skin nice &amp; soft. Significantly cheaper on Amazon - so we buy this &amp; matching lotion for the family.</li>
    <li> As expected - thank you!</li>
