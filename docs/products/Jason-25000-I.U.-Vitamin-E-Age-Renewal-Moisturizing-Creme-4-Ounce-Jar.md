<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my wife loves this stuff as a night time creme, for me its way to heavy on face and feels greasy</li>
    <li> I have a friend who told me about this product and she said that it was great and recommended by her dermatoligst but it made my face burn and break out - will not order again.</li>
    <li> The package mentions that the product was designed for mature and dry skin. I have neither. BUT I live in a very dry city and so wanted a night cream for my face that would do wonders. This one seriously does what it says it will do. I know I&#x27;m not the target demographic but I think it works well as a night cream for me. I&#x27;ve enjoyed it and would buy again. The price of this product is also very attractive for a natural, cruelty-free Vitamin E cream with such high potency. There is no weird smell and the packaging is pretty convenient.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Jason Moisturizer after using their bug bite relief gel on my daughter and finding it nothing short of a miracle gel. I have been using this for 1 week and my skin is smooth and the tone is more even. I don&#x27;t have super dry skin but it&#x27;s getting more dry as I get older, especially in the winter. This cream seems to disappear into my skin immediately, it leaves it very dewy but I would definitely not say greasy as the previous reviewer found. Possibly this is not the best moisturizer for oily skin. My only problem so far is a slight itchiness on my cheeks immediately after application. This happens to me with some other moisturizers as well, I have slight rosacea. However the rosacea has not flared up at all when using this, on the contrary, as I said, my skin has an even tone and I swear my forehead looks so much smoother.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product as an effective alternative to high-priced offerings at department stores.  I have been very happy with the improvement in my skin and the moisturizing effects.  Since I do not spend much time or money when it comes to beauty products, this cream is exactly what I was after:  results without spending a fortune.</li>
    <li> Good deal for my DIY projects.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  I use it on anywhere that&#x27;s rough. It has no odor, so you can use it anytime.  Goes on thick, but is absorbed into the skin quickly.  For a lighter application, I leave my skin damp and then apply.  Received this two-pack from Amazon and now my husband uses it too.</li>
    <li> On the recommendation of my doctor, I used this twice a day during my radiation therapy for breast cancer.  It helped the skin stay moisturized and intact.</li>
    <li> The expense of this cream is not justified by its performance. It left an oily residue on my skin, and I simply could not bear the odor. To save myself some money I simply bought a bottle of vitamin E soft gels online and squeezed one into my regular cream. That way I get the added vitamin E without the awful smell. (I also squeeze a softgel of vitamin A into the mix for good measure.)</li>
    <li> I love this cream! It soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling wonderful.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a year, and I get a lot of compliments on my skin. I almost never wear makeup either.</li>
    <li> This cream is my favorite. It keeps my skin moisturized all day long. I like it being unscented. I have been using three jars so far. My face looks much better than ever!</li>
    <li> It is a nice cream but a little heavy for me.  Makes me feel greasy so cannot leave on all night.  But was a good product just not right for my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I used it since high school.  I know some reviewers complained about the smell but it does not bother me.  I prefer it to any fragrant cremes since fragrance always makes me nauseated.  It is the most awesome moisturerizer in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Although there is nothing wrong wit the cream itself but I have noticed that the label of the cream I got shows \\&quot;nature\\&quot; instead of the \\&quot;70% organic\\&quot; as pictured. Could it be a cheaper version of the cream vs. the one I paid for or just the new label?</li>
    <li> For the record I just bought one tub of this at my local drugstore for $8. Buying 2 tubs as this is advertised on amazon would cost me $16. Much cheaper than buying here where they are charging $30, I don&#x27;t know how they came up with this price and how they can justify it. Fabulous cream, packed with great ingredients. My derm. said that Vitamin E is the best one for night with Vitamin C used during the day.</li>
    <li> This is far too greasy for my 52 year-old skin.  It even manages to get my hair greasy.  I&#x27;ve tried to use barely any at all but it still manages to feel greasy. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll use it up.</li>
    <li> Best vitamin E cream I&#x27;ve found.  Use it every day.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I use it regularly and wish I could buy it on auto-delivery!</li>
    <li> This cream has been my only relief! I have tried many and this is the only thing that provided relief to my ultra dry skin around my eyes. I love it!</li>
    <li> Very happy with product, fine wrinkles disappearing, wrinkles on knock decreasing, eye bags look a hundred percent better. Full recommend this product for any person no matter what age.</li>
    <li> I bought this a long time ago. It really lasts! I like this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help keep my tummy area from getting stretchmarks during pregnancy.  I used the creme one time and ended up with a horrible rash within 6 hours.  I have some sensitivities to additives (I have reactions to lotions and creams, but not often and usually after continued use) so I thought going with a more natural product would eliminate the risk of a reaction.  I was really surprised at not only how quickly I had a reaction, but I had the rash on body parts that I didn&#x27;t even apply the creme to which has absolutely never happened.  Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t put it on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!!  I use this on my feet at night.....it is very healing.  Keeps my feet soft and hydrated and it heals any soreness or dryness that you might have.  My daughter recommended it to me, as I was using pure Vitamin E oil, and this is actually better.  I have tried Olive Oil, Vitamin E oil and Coconut Oil and while they were good, this cream is the best.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!  After applying to feet, be sure to put on socks!  And, of course, you can use this on knees and elbows, etc. if you like, I just happen to use it on my feet.</li>
    <li> My favorite face cream.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for my working hands. Doesn&#x27;t have any toxic ingredients from what I understand either. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have used this Jason Age Renewal Moisturizing Cream for years now.  It has totally changed the texture of my face.  It is now soft and the wrinkles are definitely less defined.  A relative of mine also used this on burns from radiation treatments for cancer and the cream was the only thing that helped.  I highly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I saw how thick it was, but it absorbs wonderfully into my skin. My face is smooth and not at all oily.</li>
    <li> It goes on very moist, it absorbs into the skin shortly.  It makes my face super soft.  I put it on in the morning and evening.  I skip the sunny days because vitamin E can make you more likely to burn.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific high I.U Vitamin E moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily on my face and body.&lt;br /&gt;It is affordable and very nourishing.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Perfect for dry skin and minimizing scars.  I&#x27;ve bought two, used them up and bought two more.</li>
    <li> This cream goes all over my old body and I have told many family members and friends about it (younger and older than me). It is so great that even my pedicures do not require any scrubbing anymore (you know what I mean).</li>
    <li> I have already posted my comments about this product.  This is my 2nd purchase, and this time I purchased a double pack.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin E cream- I get a lot of sun during the summer and I apply this to prevent my face and neck from becoming bone dry and peeling. It immediately soaks into my skin- it doesn&#x27;t feel wet or slick, but moisturized and healthy. I love the entire Jason line of products, and I&#x27;m glad I tried this product out. I will be buying again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t put a lot on because I get redness on my cheeks regularly.  It works great on exfoliating.  When I wake up the next morning, my skin looks smoother and feels smooth. I put it on other parts of my body and the effect is the same.  My complaint is that the creme feels like it is covering so much that it is not letting my skin breathe and also I wish it didn&#x27;t have such matte appearance.  I want a little more shine,not too much.  Im thankful for it, though because it makes my skin smooth but I may not continue to use it because of my complaint.</li>
    <li> I’m a person that likes to periodically switch creams, but no matter how many other creams I try, I always return to this one.  It doesn’t take much of it to keep my skin soft.  If I use too much my skin feels oily.  The only place I use a little extra is on a couple of deep wrinkles.  It seems to plump up my skin so they’re less noticeable.  It’s really a very nice face cream that I’ve used for years and hope to continue using.  My skin used to be oily, but now tends to be dry.  This cream really helps my skin to stay moist and supple.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly heavy creme. I have extremely dry skin and live in a very dry climate, so for me, it works wonderfully well. I combine it with a Peptide creme and also use a Vit C serum and coconut/Vit E oil underneath. For most people, this combo would grease them up for a week. For me, it&#x27;s my twice daily care, and works really well. Have not used Jason&#x27;s in the summer before, so will see how well it works in the hotter weather. So far, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the soft, silky feel it leaves on my face and hands.</li>
    <li> I live in Maine and as a very senior, senior, found I needed more moisture, in my moisturizer!! This does the trick! A little goes a long way and I don&#x27;t find it at all greasy, but the again, we all have our own experiences and opinions.I have to use up my old favourite, but this is now my new one. Glad I tried it and it&#x27;s a good buy for 2 jars.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this vitamin E cream as one of the ingredients for making homemade hand and skin cream.  For that purpose it worked great -- basically a mix of 1 part vitamin E cream, 1 part organic coconut oil, and 2 parts of high quality unscented baby lotion.  I whip it up and add one of my favorite essential oils (usually either citrus or one of the \\&quot;sleepy-time\\&quot; scents.  Great stuff!  I like it better than any of the \\&quot;ultra-healing\\&quot; type skin creams on the market.  Super for feet, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t expect was how much I like just the plain vitamin E cream for my face.  For most of my lifetime, I&#x27;ve spent way too much money on department store facial creams.  I started using the vitamin E cream on my neck and now also use it in the evening before bed for my face.  It gives a glow to my skin and is very emollient-rich.  I would have given it 5 stars; but I really don&#x27;t like using it earlier in the day if I&#x27;m going to be putting on makeup.  I usually just brush a little mineral powder foundation on and I find that the vitamin E cream remains too moist on my face.  As a result, the powder tends to really pile on and look \\&quot;cakey.\\&quot;  On weekends when I&#x27;m going without makeup, though, I usually use this cream.</li>
    <li> I have not used this cream for several years but always loved it. Decided to order it again and still love it!</li>
    <li> This is THE moisturizer. Will never purchase anything else for my 55+ skin.</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I are in our 60&#x27;s. I use this each night before bed. I&#x27;ve also found that Vitamin E is a good itch reliever for insect bites!</li>
    <li> Delighted with your price. I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time-it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is great for night time use. It does give an oily appearance, but to me that&#x27;s part of the appeal because I have dry skin and this does a great job in hydrating it.</li>
    <li> 8I SAW A Jar of this stuff on my beautiful daughter-in-laW&#x27;S COMPUTER - I ASKED HER ABOUT IT (MAYBE IT WAS HER MAGIC BEAUTY POTION) AND SHE TOLD ME SHE LOVED IT AND, AS A MATTER OF FACT, MY SON LIKED IT ALSO.  SOOO,I ORDERED 2 JARS AND I AM QUITE HAPPY WITH IT - NO BEAUTeous results yet but it is a good moisturizer and i would recommend.  damn always hitting that cap lock!</li>
    <li> Using it for lots of years, agrees with my skin, miss my previous moisturizer that was discontinued, this cream works for me.</li>
    <li> I discovered this cream here on Amazon after looking for a very long time.  It works great!  My hands are super dry and so are my husbands and this cream makes our hands soft and not dry.  My husband always gets cracks around his fingers but not after using this product.  I recommend this to anyone who needs that something extra in their cream.  It has a faint smell to it.  Not too girlie or too manly smelling.</li>
    <li> This stuff is one of the only lotions I know of that is not full of toxic crap but *actually* seems to do what lotion should do!  Really well, as a matter of fact. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face (at night, maybe a little heavy for day) for years and I think it does wonders. Also on my hands when they are really dry. My tough, manly office co-worker who does winter sports comes over and borrows it for his cracked hands, ha.  Come to think of it, I sneak it onto my handy-man boyfriends hands when he&#x27;s busy watching TV too, and it makes a big difference, even on those rough, scratched up calloused paws! In short, this stuff is the bomb!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and not greasy. No smell and goes on smoothly. Kids can use this easily. This is a great everyday lotion!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this lotion. It is excellent for dry skin, it lasts a long time and the price is low.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dry at surface but it tends to make pimples. I was worried that I may get pimples but it did not affect negatively my skin in any way. Now this is my number one moisturizer.</li>
    <li> made my skin extremely irritated.</li>
    <li> working on stretch marks - seeing minimal results, but know if I were more religious about application, results would be dramatically increased.</li>
    <li> E-cream is wonderful for anti aging and also diminishes scars from new surgeries. The cream is odorless and non staining. Shippment was timely.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years! It is thick and creamy, and it makes my skin soft and supple, despite the fact that I live in a desert. It does leave my skin feeling the tiniest bit sticky/tacky to the touch (you can feel that there&#x27;s a layer of moisturizer there) but I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy to me at all (I hate that feeling). I wear sunscreen and makeup over it just fine, but sometimes little hairs from my makeup brush do stick to my face because of the slight tackiness. Some people may prefer to just use this product at night before bed. It feels luxurious and rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the price can&#x27;t be beat for a really good moisturizer! Because it&#x27;s affordable, I slather it all over my face, neck, and upper chest without feeling like I have to &amp;#34;make it last.&amp;#34; When I buy expensive moisturizer in those ridiculously tiny tubes, I stretch it as far as I can, which kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> Good consistency, rubs in easily, very little surface residue, keeps skin soft and pliable.  Helps minor dry patches heal well.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I used to buy it in bulk and finally ran out after years. I was disappointed that my old favorite cream had been reformulated but it turns out, this new formulation is even better. Has all the good qualities of the original but is not so heavy. This is great for dry winter skin... it really moisturizes the heavy dryness and soothes all those dry skin cracks. The best part is that it&#x27;s natural... no perfumes or dyes. My husband and I used to fight over it until we got smart and got one for each of us!</li>
    <li> I am 76 yrs old and people take me for being in my 50&#x27;s and it is all due to this product.  If I have to go without it I become all pruney and old looking.  You ship quickly and payment is easy.</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite moisturizer, and I&#x27;ve used it for years. If your feet are dry, try applying a rich coating and then wear socks or peds while sleeping.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! Jason makes the best stuff for tattoo aftercare!!!</li>
    <li> Very good face cream and much less expensive on Amazon. I purchased several jars of it so it will last a while. It is quite thick and a little goes a long way so will last.</li>
    <li> The cream is impresive. repairs the skin while you sleep. is a bit oily at first but it does the job while you sleep</li>
    <li> This is the 25,000 vitamin E and is much thicker than the 5,000 vitamin E, which I&#x27;ve used before. I&#x27;d recommend the 5,000 instead.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have found. I&#x27;ve tried many over the years including various expensive department store brands but this one works the best. I have suffered from allergic reactions,especially when the moisturizer gets too close to my eyes but not with this brand.  Thank you for making a reasonably priced cream that works well.</li>
    <li> Great, and fast service</li>
    <li> It is very smooth like a silk,  I love it , it&#x27;s just perfect on my skin. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. Great product at a great  price. I&#x27;m in my mid 20s so I bought it to try and slow down the aging of my face a bit. I don&#x27;t wear make up(EVER) and I try to use natural products on my skin and in my home. This creme is THICK so I don&#x27;t have to use much and it got rid of my acne too! I wish I could give this product more than 5 stars. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of stuff on my face. I even tried Proactive but none of it worked for me. I use an all natural facial cleanser(desert essence) &amp; then I use this AMAZING creme! I use both of them at least twice a day. I do get the occasional breakout but then I use Christopher&#x27;s Black Ointment for spot treatment. My skin stays hydrated &amp; mostly acne free! I told my fiance about this product and he now uses it on his hands. He works as an electrician at a steel mill &amp; his hands were always so rough &amp; dry. He now takes this with him in his lunch box. It works better than anything else we tried for him. They still end up being a little dry but that is better than them being so dry &amp; cracked that they bleed. I hope this helps! I definitely strongly suggest this product. I already bought some for my Mother-in-law &amp; I&#x27;m giving some to my mom, brother, &amp; sister next. &amp; yes men can use it, it is unscented.</li>
    <li> At 31 I&#x27;m trying to stay ahead of my aging skin.  The fine lines I was seeing... GONE!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for five months but noticed immediate results.  I&#x27;m now in need of more and am stocking up.  My mother and mother-in-law both tried it.  MIL broke out on her chin-she has sensitive skin.  My mom just ordered two jars-she loves it and her skin glows.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that the more you use it, the more it works.  A little goes a long way so applying morning and night really gives a youthful glow.  I just apply around my eyes in the morning and am quite pleased.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Wish I could buy this in 5 gallon tubs!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this facial lotion.  It makes my skin soft, but doesn&#x27;t feel like it clogging my pores or making it hard for my pores to breathe.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon when my local store stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> Very good product for extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> I like it but I&#x27;m getting tired of making up the number of words for this review it&#x27;s a real pain.</li>
    <li> Love the product!  It really works well on sun and acne spots though you must be patient and diligent when using.  Very pleased at the fast shipping and think the price was GREAT!  If you are thinking of buying Vitamin E...buy here and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older and my face drier, I am on a constant quest to find a good face cream. I have had limited success. Other creams may be good moisturizers, but they are heavy and greasy. Or else they have a strong smell. If a cream isn&#x27;t heavy, it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works without being heavy or greasy. It sinks in to my skin and leaves it feeling smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* No scent. So many creams have heavy, cloying scents that really turn me off. Not so this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The Vitamin E in the cream. Vitamin E helps protect skin against the cell damage from sun and pollution. Who knows if that is really the case. All I know is that my skin looks better after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s a great value. One jar lasts me almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream to anyone wanting to have better looking skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this creme for years, and it is nice to see it available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is great for dehydrated skin.&lt;br /&gt;But I have also used it to help heal small scabbed wounds like ant bites and scratches,&lt;br /&gt;and I think they heal faster and with no visible scars. This is not antibiotic,&lt;br /&gt;so I wait til the wound has a scab before I use this.</li>
    <li> This product is working nicely for me- very moisturizing and no redness (which many creams cause for me).  Also, perhaps it is a new formulation, but my jar does not contain any parabens!  I bought it at Whole Foods yesterday.</li>
    <li> I have been using this as my daily face cream for a few years now.  I love it!  It is a little heavy sometimes....so a little goes a long way.  But, I definitely credit it to keeping my skin looking pretty young &amp;#34;for my age&amp;#34;...47.  I will definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have been faithfully using this moisturizer for about 30 years!  (Yike!)  It has served me very well.  I also apply it after I have put on Retin A cream at bedtime and I have very little skin peeling because of it.</li>
    <li> Super product!  Great company!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this tonight, used my regular daily cleanser, and applied just a little to my face, rubbing and massaging it in.&lt;br /&gt;Huge mistake! Within a few minutes my face started feeling warm. I went to look in the mirror and my entire face is a hot, deep RED. And, raised!&lt;br /&gt;Now the ONLY thing I can think of, is that it has avacado in it, and I DO have an allergy to bananas-which is maybe in the same fruit family. I&#x27;ve never heard of such a thing, but who knows? I bought this because of the great reviews and that the lady at our health food store said it is gentle and pure.</li>
    <li> I like natural products and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few over the years.  I haven&#x27;t always been pleased with them.  I use the Jason Tea Time moisturizer and so I thought I would try the Vitamin E creme.  I admit I like to use a combination of both cremes at once.  The vitamin E creme is not greasy but absorbs well into the skin and really does the trick.  My skin stays moisturized all day long.  I use these products in the morning and before bed.  I also have sensitive eyes that become irritated by even having creme close to them.  Neither of these products bothers my eyes.</li>
