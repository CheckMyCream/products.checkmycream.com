### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was very happy with this and would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s on a budget and doesn&#x27;t have the finances to see a doctor.</li>
      <li>Dr. Mercola introduced this product on the Dr. Oz show and it was really impressive stuff - and non toxic.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not a happy camper!</li>
      <li>This is probably one of the best things of using Curaderm: it reaches malignant cells that are not visible on the surface.</li>
      <li>The Curaderm products are wonderful and although they are a bit pricey are the best suntan product you can buy out there...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is excellent value</li>

      <li>What impressed me was the studies showed there is almost no chance of recurrence.  </li>

      <li>It worked perfectly.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;M SO HAPPY FOR HIM..  </li>
      <li>I had great hopes for this product, having seen Dr. Oz and Dr. Mercola tout it on Oz&#x27;s show.  </li>
      <li>Using the cream on some skin problems I have had for some time, it appears to be greatly reducing the affected areas.</li>
      <li>My dermatologists had suggested excision or mohs surgery which I have experienced before on spots on my face and ear.</li>
      <li>I think it is amazing stuff!</li>
      <li>I was told that even if surgery was successful, the cancer could return because there may be microscopic cancer cells that would not be seen by the veterinarian.  </li>
      <li>and you will be good as new\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I am 70, fair skin, never used sun screen and stayed outdoors a lot.  </li>
      <li>I was delighted to see.</li>
      <li>who had some good results from it.  </li>
      <li>Excellent customer service for a product that really works - thank you for carrying this!!! :)</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s safe!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why I haven&#x27;t heard more about this product!  </li>
      <li>This is a great product but it is important to know that if it is ordered through Bionational.com, it comes with customer support.  </li>
      <li>The healing process has been amazing to watch, and I suspect I will be done in another week or so.  </li>
      <li>Curaderm is amazing..</li>
      <li>So here goes my experience, which hopefully will help you with your own treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The tan tape works perfectly for me and is very inconspicuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Curaderm Bec5 is an amazingly effective treatment if used correctly.</li>
      <li>the Curaderm was purchased, we did not know this and thought it was equally effective on both types.&lt;br</li>
      <li>piece of tape on your face is very unattractive and you commit to six or more weeks of not looking your best when you start treatment.  </li>
      <li>very easy to apply</li>
      <li>If any are available, it would be wise to view them</li>
      <li>There was one day, about two days before the covering came off, that it must have really been doing it&#x27;s magic because I had a headache in the area being treated and didn&#x27;t feel very good.</li>
      <li>Te pain is tremendous !!  </li>
      <li>The  companion book is very important.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because I did not see it in my pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Once I started the process, I committed to it and am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I used it on my face and top of my head.</li>
      <li>What surprises me is that more users do not complain about the pain.</li>
      <li>Maybe if I applied it more than two or three times a day.  </li>
      <li>Make sure the wound heals from the inside and out .</li>
      <li>I like it better than using liquid nitrogen.</li>
      <li>If many people go against the recommendations and try treating melanomas or moles, the FDA will take this product off the market.  </li>
      <li>I was not looking forward to five more biopsies, all suspected basal cells, and now hope to avoid them as well as the surgeries that would follow.</li>
      <li>My husband did not want to have any more of his ear cut off, so we decided to use the Curaderm Bec5 that was on the Dr. Oz show.  </li>
      <li>I think it is working a bit better on me because I did not let the Dr. Treat the area</li>
      <li>the product has been more of a moisturizer than anything else.</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I discovered the Curaderm cream.</li>
      <li>It could take many weeks to fully eradicate a skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is so much better than the Mohs surgery I&#x27;ve been through for skin cancer on my face twice before.  </li>
      <li>It is great for removing pre cancerous brown crusty spots that we get from sunning so much.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It has no effect on healthy cells.  </li>
      <li>The Squamous on the top of my head took the longest.</li>
      <li>You could put it on a healthy skin area and nothing would happen at all.  </li>
      <li>If you follow the directions, wash the area and reapply Curaderm, covering with the tape twice a day (or more often), it will work.</li>
      <li>One more to treat and one still working on.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to respond until I was completely sure of success.[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>confident that Curaderm has done its job</li>
      <li>It concerned me that I was causing more problems, so I discontinued use.  </li>
      <li>Did get some scarring on one spot, but think it was more to the tape pulling my flesh off than the Curaderm product.</li>
      <li>When the instructions say not to get it on healthy skin you had better listen.  </li>
      <li>I have found that my nose looks a lot like most of the patient pictures I have seen by people using Curaderm.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want any more MOHS surgeries and am so thankful to have found Curaderm.  </li>
      <li>I am a satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>SO GLAD</li>
      <li>For this I laid a gauze on top of the lesion and applied the liquid until the gauze was soaked.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure I should do it.</li>
      <li>Granted he did a very good job, but the pain, the scars and the puzzle work on my head was enough.</li>
      <li>Now just one more spot and hopefully his ear will be cancer free.  </li>
      <li>If this is true, then it&#x27;s best not to order in summer when the outside temperature is over 77F.  </li>
      <li>It will be easy for you to notice when this happens.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You must expect to clean, medicate, and dress lesion 3,4 5 times a day for many weeks (for me it was 7).</li>
      <li>You will notice it easily.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a scar, which is pretty amazing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is normal (and a good sign) that a whitish, yellowish or brownish matter comes out of the lesion.</li>
      <li>The first week you might even feel that you will not be able to stand the pain for many weeks.</li>
      <li>FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS, and check with support if you have questions and you&#x27;ll be jsut fine.  </li>
      <li>I had trouble with the post office but the company was very good and worked with me and made sure I received my cream.</li>
      <li>This should be readily available in the U.S.</li>
      <li>I just started the treatment on a basal cell (confirmed cancerous) close to my eye.</li>
      <li>It is no substitute for a dermatologist, which should be consulted when the condition is advanced.</li>
      <li>I was told it&#x27;s important that the area doesn&#x27;t form a scab or it will leave a scar.</li>
      <li>Moreover,by then, Imiquimod was available for&lt;br /&gt;similar use.</li>
      <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
      <li>I used this on a confirmed squamous cell cancer on lower leg.  </li>
      <li>I studied the reviews on Amazon, and went to the Curaderm website to get detailed information on how to use and what to expect.</li>
      <li>I may have a biopsy performed just to make sure, but, right now I</li>
      <li>very rarely write reviews.</li>
      <li>The cost is high, but it is still cheaper than Fluoroplex, a prescription alternative that may not be as effective.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because I would have been freaked out at first.</li>
      <li>A small price to pay when you know the cancer is eradicated for good, with no scarring!!</li>
      <li>There appears to be no trace of the original bcc.</li>
      <li>First and foremost I&#x27;ve never been able to get it to the cream substance suggested.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Whether Curaderm is a \\&quot;snake oil treatment\\&quot;, or a real breakthrough in squamus/basal cancers, I cannot say. The fact in my case is this: it worked.</li>
    <li> I suspected that I had the non-melanoma cancer on my nose. I didn&#x27;t want to have a chunk taken out for biopsy. It was a very small sore that wouldn&#x27;t heal. I gave it a go and within one week it was gone. I tried it on a age spot (sun damaged spot really) It worked on that also. If you can live with a ugly red spot, for me it was a week, it&#x27;s worth it. The dark spot then peeled off and I had fresh pink skin showing. I treated in the evening. I have used an age spot lightener and it did nothing. Mine is gone. I&#x27;m ordering a extra tube in case the FDA gets involved.&lt;br /&gt;Curaderm does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I very rarely write reviews.</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;m thinning. I developed this dark spot the size of a quarter on top of my head. It looks like a old age liver spot. It also could be melanoma. I realized that this product doesn&#x27;t work for melanoma. I didn&#x27;t know what would happen. Anyway I applied the cream two times a day. The spot got inflamed and turned very dark. I kept up the treatment. After a few days&lt;br /&gt;I could peel off the scab (I know your not supposed to do this) Anyway after peeling of this ugly skin. I was delighted to see. Brand new baby like skin were the ugly black spot used to be. I&#x27;m keeping up the application for awhile just to make sure all the bad cells are distroyed.&lt;br /&gt;So this product worked for me. I got the ugly spot removed for $125. Was it worth it... Id say!&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to rejuvenate old skin.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck everybody.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and find it very good at eliminating potentially cancerous skin moles and other worrisome skin conditions.  I am using it again and it is doing what it is supposed to do for me.  I realize that it is expensive, but what would several medical exams and procedures cost?  I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as you should be buying any health care stuff online, but this worked exactly as advertized.  I had a basel cell forming on the right side of my face.  I previously has surgery for one and did not want to go through that again.  I used this cream.  The spot turned red and then white and then swelled a little and then the tumor fell off and new skin formed.  It worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> We purchased this in Jan of 2012 for a basal cell carcinoma on my husband&#x27;s ear.  It is just now almost completely healed (4/18/12).  It was very painful at first, and we wondered if that was normal.  Over the course of the weeks, the pain went away.  Went from red, to white, to \\&quot;caved in\\&quot;, to healing, to almost now totally healed.  I&#x27;m pretty sure surgery would have been very disfiguring.  We had been noticing big red blood vessels (before treatment) going to the BCC.  Now they are gone.  Heard about this with Dr. Mercola.  Praise the Lord Jesus for this product.</li>
    <li> Within seven days melted a BCC down past skin level.  After four weeks starting to shrink and heal .  Would recommend this to anyone over Mohs surgery.  Takes longer but very little pain and no fear of introduced infection.</li>
    <li> My husband had been diagnosed with skin cancer on his ear, went to a dermatologist to have the cancerous area cut off. Six months later at a regular checkup another cancer has shown up.  My husband did not want to have any more of his ear cut off, so we decided to use the Curaderm Bec5 that was on the Dr. Oz show.  I studied the reviews on Amazon, and went to the Curaderm website to get detailed information on how to use and what to expect. I&#x27;m glad I did because I would have been freaked out at first. The areas treated got very \\&quot;angry\\&quot;. But as stated on the website, it did not bother the skin that was not cancerous. We have treated two spots and they have completely healed.  Now just one more spot and hopefully his ear will be cancer free.  As suggested on a review from Amazon we are following up with Tamanu oil on the new clear skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff saved me from expensive surgery and eliminated the basal cell carcinoma. I had treated myself with black salve (that turned out to be a bad idea) and so the discharge from my treatment site was often black. The Curaderm treatment took a long time for me, they said because of the scar tissue the black salve caused, but Curaderm really worked. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This cream was purchased in hopes of curing basal cell carcinoma on my husband&#x27;s head. We did not want him to have surgery. Hallelujah! The cancer is slowly disappearing. This is truly a miracle product. We had tried raspberry cream on the advice of our chiropractor&#x27;s father, but it didn&#x27;t have any effect on the cancer. I am so glad that I discovered the Curaderm cream.</li>
    <li> I notified you when I first received the product, Note: When I first tried to use the product it was all clear liquid, not like all the other times I have used in the past for years. It all came out at one time clear liquid , not cream as it had always bee. Please replace it at no cost to me. The product has always done a fine job in the past. My Doctor has advised me to continue to use it as I am a Skin Cancer surviver. Thank you, John Coffey 501-690-1357 coffey@excap.com</li>
    <li> John, You may have already found this out, but if you read Dr. Cham&#x27;s book The Eggplant Cure, he tells you that the product often arrives with the products separated and liquid (because of shipping environments). He tells you to vigorously shake the tube for one minute (no less) to recombine the ingredients and then place it in the freezer for an hour. Thereafter, keep it in the regular refrigerator compartment. Best wishes!</li>
    <li> Curaderm BEC5  works. I recommend it to my clients who wants to remove \\&quot;brown\\&quot; spots, actinic keratosis, basal cell and squamos cell carcinoma themselves. It is very important not to end the treatment too soon because the cancer may come back. Make sure the wound heals from the inside and out . If insecure, work with a health care practitioner/esthetician familiar with the cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using Curaderm for about 4 weeks, and the product is really working. After the second week of use the cancer on my nose looked horrible, and was 3 times larger then I thought. I didn&#x60;t give up, and I&#x60;m glad I didn&#x60;t, because now almost all the cancer is gone, and 80% of my skin has grown back. I had 2 surgery&#x60;s before I tryed Curaderm, and the surgent didn&#x60;t get any of the cancer out, just made a mess of my nose. After 4 weeks now there is 2 area&#x60;s that need to finish healing, about the size of a pencil eraser on both. I&#x60;m not sure if the cancer will come back? If it dose? I will write another review. Right now I&#x60;m thinking positive. Thanks Curaderm, and Amazon for offering this product.  Jim</li>
    <li> I just finished using Curaderm to treat a couple of suspicious spots on my nose.  Total treatment time-- 3 weeks. This is so much better than the Mohs surgery I&#x27;ve been through for skin cancer on my face twice before.  I had a 1/8\\&quot; spot on my nose that I&#x27;d had the dermatologist look at and she agreed it looked suspicious. It was doing the typical heal and bleed cycle and then ended up with a very small donut shaped ridge. As I started using the Curaderm (shake up the tube and squeeze any fluid into a tissue so you just get the cream) I decided to also treat a second suspicious dot near the first one.  Within a day, I had two indentations that over the next couple of days merged into one deeper indentation.  It was a little scary looking and I was surprised that it worked so quickly.  It was amazing that over the next few days, it completely filled in and as of yesterday, at the three week mark, I&#x27;m done. The company I ordered from (BioNational) offered the 1/2\\&quot; x 10 yds tan micropore tape and I should have gotten it from them as I ended up driving all over town looking for it. If you follow the directions, wash the area and reapply Curaderm, covering with the tape twice a day (or more often), it will work. Unlike other topical pharmaceuticals out there, Curaderm only attacks cancer cells. Although they recommend keeping it off adjacent skin areas, it will not cause pitting or indentations on any skin that isn&#x27;t cancerous which is reassuring since it sometimes spreads a little when you press the tape on it. It might seem expensive, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to the surgery co-pay and if you store it in the refrigerator, it lasts 5 years.  For a small cancer like the one I treated, you will use almost nothing out of the tube, it takes so little. What impressed me was the studies showed there is almost no chance of recurrence.  I can tell there will be no scarring either and I&#x27;m using the suggested Tamanu oil at night to help continue the healing.  This should be readily available in the U.S. and I hope it is in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (May, 2012): With my dermatologist&#x27;s approval, I have since treated two precancerous spots on the backs of my hands, which took exactly one week to get rid of completely.</li>
    <li> I have had 3 small reddish scaley spots on sides of my face where I shave sideburns for several years. I think the were A K but were never diagnosed.  I also had a small pin head sized recourring spot on nose that had been removed by dermatologist an diagnosed as a fiberoid. Sun exposure and shaving irritated these spots and alovera gel helped some.  I started the use of the curaderm on July 10 twice daily and covered. About day 3 I noticed burning for minutes after applying and sluffing off of dead dark skin in layers for 2 weeks.  There was new light pink soft skin where scale spots had been, and I began the use of neosporin ointment and small bandaids for a week..some itching noticed.  After a month, only the faintest sign of the oldest (5-6 year) AK is visable.  The fiberoid is gone too without cutting.  I wish I had taken before and after pictures of the spots.  I hope this will be helpful.</li>
    <li> Curaderm really does work. I have had a spot on my nose for about 2 years and tried just about everything. Was planning to see my doctor but then I found Curaderm and thought I would give this a try first.  I just finished day seven.  I have found that my nose looks a lot like most of the patient pictures I have seen by people using Curaderm.  I had some pretty bad swelling on my nose and under my eyes - someone thought my husband must have hit me...but tonight I noticed the swelling is down considerably.  I just read some other helpful reviews like shaking the tube vigorously.  I did put it in my freezer for a short while because it does separate.  I really should have taken pictures to share but there are plenty out there on Youtube if you search.  The stuff hurts putting it on - be prepared...I have to mentally psych myself to do it.  But after 4 or 5 minutes the sting goes away.  This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap but then neither is the chemotherapy creams your doctor would prescribe - not to mention the terrible side effects of those \\&quot;chemo\\&quot; creams and who wants surgery???  If you can avoid it - do!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical if a cream could cure skin cancer but after having two sources, one on my arm and the other on my ear it&#x27;s made me a believer. The one on my arm took about 4 weeks and the ear about 6 weeks to heal up. I didn&#x27;t want to respond until I was completely sure of success.[[ASIN:B005G5MBFQ Curaderm Bec5 20 ml Cream]]</li>
    <li> We bought this product after hearing Doctor Oz speak of Curaderm on his TV show. My husband applied the cream to a sore on his nose which has been noticeable for several years. He works outdoors as a hiking guide and is in the sun on a daily basis, so we knew this could be a pre-cancerous condition. Nothing seemed to help get rid of the bump on his nose. After using just a small amount of Curaderm cream, in 3 days the red bump started to peel away and within a week the sore was completely gone. If you have any inclination of pre-cancerous growths like he did, I highly recommend this product because it works! He continues to work outdoors and this product will be part of his first aid kit. On the hikes his clients will hear about natural remedies and if they work or not -- this one did the trick.</li>
    <li> I would not recomment this to my worst enemy !!!  Te pain is tremendous !!  It made my basel cell much worse  it grew from 1/8 of an inch to almost 2In. in diameter. it is much wiser toget a dermotologist freeze it.</li>
    <li> I learned about Curaderm from my sister in CA. who had some good results from it.  I had surgery on my forehead around 8 months ago to remove a cancer.  After a few months I had a growth growing in the same area as the removed cancer.  I&#x27;m guessing that the doctor missed part of the cancer but I can&#x27;t be sure that it was not a new growth and that it was a cancer.  I let it go for a long time untill it got quite large and I knew it had to be checked.  My sister told me about the Curaderm so I ordered a tube and after using it for 3 weeks the growth is completely gone. It has now been almost 2 weeks and now new growth.  If I have no new growth in another 2 weeks I would give it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> I cannot dispute the claims of reviewers who found the product &#x27;works&#x27; to cure basal cell cancers, since I was unable to endure the treatment long enough to see the end result. What surprises me is that more users do not complain about the pain. As expected, Curaderm quickly began to melt away the surface layers of skin and exposed open, raw &#x27;wounds.&#x27; These sites grew larger by the day, as the surrounding skin became intensely red and somewhat swollen. My personal observation of the response of my skin to the cream makes me wonder if it only kills cancer cells but does not disturb healthy cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I would have been wiser to apply it to only one spot instead of several. Starting out very small would have resulted in a less traumatic experience. I was caught off guard by the intensity of discomfort, though I have a moderate tolerance for pain. My open lesions reacted to the cream with an intense  burning, stinging, throbbing sensation.  This got worse as increased surface skin &#x27;melted away.&#x27;  The intense redness, swelling, and heat was doubtless an inflammatory response, but scary looking nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 or 12 days of using Curaderm twice daily, my tolerance for self-inflicted pain reached a breaking point. I stopped Curaderm and began applying Tamanu oil. The Tamanu oil had a soothing response. Since I am continuing to use it and the sites have not completely healed, I cannot report on the final outcome. I am disappointed that the expensive Curaderm cream did not help me avoid additional surgeries for basal cell cancers. My best advice - if you are planning to use it, try it on just one site and see how it goes!</li>
    <li> Dr. Mercola introduced this product on the Dr. Oz show and it was really impressive stuff - and non toxic. I had a couple of suspicious areas on my face that the dermatologist said should be biopsied. I decided to try this product first before I had any divots taken out of my face. It&#x27;s a small tube but you don&#x27;t need much at all. I applied it with a Qtip three to four times a day just on the affected area only and kept it covered.One spot was on my check and the other two spots were on my forehead. It would sting right after application for a while, maybe 15 minutes.  There was one day, about two days before the covering came off, that it must have really been doing it&#x27;s magic because I had a headache in the area being treated and didn&#x27;t feel very good. It&#x27;s been a week and a half and the bad stuff hardened and came off and there&#x27;s a slight crater. I have stopped using the Curaderm now and am keeping it covered and moist with the recommended organic oil and some organic calendula cream. I was told it&#x27;s important that the area doesn&#x27;t form a scab or it will leave a scar. I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Have read and heard about this product for over a  year.  It worked for me.  The  companion book is very important.  If you are worried about results, work with your doctor.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered promptly. Using the cream on some skin problems I have had for some time, it appears to be greatly reducing the affected areas.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to spend the money on this cream in case it didn&#x27;t work.  Once I started the process, I committed to it and am so glad I did.  There were moments of doubt during the second week, but by the end of the third week, my skin is normal and healthy again.</li>
    <li> First and foremost I&#x27;ve never been able to get it to the cream substance suggested.  It is watery and no matter how much I shake it as suggested it pours out watery. This really makes me mad :( for the price and to see it dripping out all over.  So, I&#x27;ve used the watery part for a couple of spots and as mentioned later in these reviews it has burned surrounding skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not continued use while I wait for healing of these thus far and then will determine whether to proceed or not. So the vote is still out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a happy camper!</li>
    <li> Should not be used by medical novices.We do not know how to tell the difference between the two. My wife has both beta cell and squamous cell skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;If applied to a squamous cell cancer, it sorely irritates a large area around the obvious growth and&lt;br /&gt;we had to stop the application due to watery puss coming out.  It left the area very hard and rough.&lt;br /&gt;When the Curaderm was purchased, we did not know this and thought it was equally effective on both types.&lt;br /&gt; purchased at amazon .com&lt;br /&gt;Other purchases at Amazon .com have been very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This product works as it was expected. My spot is healing now, I will see if it is all gone.&lt;br /&gt;If definately ate away the skin. It did burn when initially applied.&lt;br /&gt;Better than having it surgically removed.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005G5MBFQ Curaderm Bec5 20 ml Cream]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After 30 days-going as advertized.&lt;br /&gt;80 year old man I must have lots of sun damage,from pea size rough spot to 1/2 $ size.&lt;br /&gt;Spread to 2 or three additional leasions.&lt;br /&gt;By buying thru amazon it was dificult to know where to get questions answered.&lt;br /&gt;Orginal spot starting  to heal as shown,other flare ups about 10 days behind.&lt;br /&gt;Hurts like hell to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Expenive- 126$ for 20/1000 Ltr. comes to 24,000$ a gal.&lt;br /&gt;I guess gas aint so bad</li>
    <li> I had great hopes for this product, having seen Dr. Oz and Dr. Mercola tout it on Oz&#x27;s show.  I applied it to a very small spot on my face that hadn&#x27;t healed in eight or nine months.  Within twenty four hours, a section of my face the size of the palm of my hand swelled up into an angry, deep red welt.  When my eye began to get swollen and started to close, I discontinued use. It&#x27;s been four days and I&#x27;m almost back to normal, but the episode scared the pants off of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that I may have a special sensitivity to whatever is in Curaderm, but the fact that much more of my face became involved than the area immediately surrounding the problem spot caused me to back away from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;d just say, keep close tabs on yourself when you use it.  At some point, I think it&#x27;s probably not worth risking that you&#x27;re one of the few who&#x27;ll react negatively to it.</li>
    <li> My mother was told she needed surgery on her face to eliminate a small pre-cancerous growth. It would be costly, time consuming and leave a small scar. I suggested the Curaderm Bec5 Cream and ordered for it without any hestitation and because of this recommendation she avoided surgery and no longer has the growth on her face.&lt;br /&gt;I believe 100% in this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to help themselves with natural products.</li>
    <li> So far it looks like it is doing the job, will be able to tell in another week or so.</li>
    <li> I used it as directed for more than two months on a small basal cell area. There was no beneficial effect, and the spot actually grew a bit immediately afterward. Very disappointed, especially given the price of this product.</li>
    <li> I have had five surgeries plus two additional biopsies for basal cell skin cancers on my face and was beginning to think &amp;#34;scarface&amp;#34; as I looked in the mirror.  I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at picking out trouble spots.  I feel confident that this product really does just react with cancer cells.  I did a three day trial on a patch of normal skin on my leg, and nothing happened.  A presumed basal cell on my forehead is disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Dr. Cham&#x27;s book in hopes I would get more direction, but it wasn&#x27;t very helpful.  It does say that once the cream has separated, it cannot be used.  If this is true, then it&#x27;s best not to order in summer when the outside temperature is over 77F.  I have just ordered two extra tubes and put them in the refrigerator for future use.  I was alarmed that someone was using the cream for a suspected melanoma.  In melanoma the skin lesion is a hint to deadly cancer, not something to be erased.  If you suspect melanoma get to a surgeon and have a biopsy.  If many people go against the recommendations and try treating melanomas or moles, the FDA will take this product off the market.  I suspect that their primary function is to support the big drug companies anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An additional directive in the book says that if the tape falls off, you should immediately reapply the cream and the new tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with the treatment is trying to get the cream exactly where you want it.  It&#x27;s impossible.  Wash your&lt;br /&gt;hands after treatment, because as you press down the tape a bit of product oozes out of the tape onto your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;The second problem is knowing when to stop treatment.  I was hoping the book,  The Eggplant Cancer Cure,  would&lt;br /&gt;have a lot of pictures to help with the decision, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the product overall.  I was not looking forward to five more biopsies, all suspected basal cells, and now hope to avoid them as well as the surgeries that would follow.I&#x27;m going to finish the one treatment I&#x27;ve started, and then begin in late fall to start new treatments.  These cancers are slow growing, and it should be safe to wait.  The convenience of not having to keep the cream in the refrigerator and of not worrying as much about sun exposure (to be avoided) will outweigh the danger of waiting for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A piece of tape on your face is very unattractive and you commit to six or more weeks of not looking your best when you start treatment.  Surgery and bandages are even uglier, but for a shorter time.</li>
    <li> Very pricey cream but well worth it as it works extremely well to get rid of basal cell skin cancers.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> About a year and a half ago, for the second time, I had a basal cell carcinoma removed from my temple, this time requiring 21 stitches and 4 hours of procedure. As we have a high deductible health insurance policy, this was an expensive treatment.&lt;br /&gt;A few months later I noticed 2 of the same little spot along the stitch line coming back so I started applying hydrocortisone.  The spots would look like they were getting better and then come back so I decided I would go to my 6 month follow up and ask.  Lets just say the response I got from the Dr. was not satisfactory.  I had heard about Curaderm from both Dr. Mercola and Dr. Oz and decided to try it.  I began application on 02.01.13.  There is a sharp stinging burning sensation that lasts for about 5 minutes upon application but then subsides.  The area treated opened up from the aprox. half diameter of a pencil eraser head to the diameter of a quarter.  This is due to the Curaderm eating away and killing the basal cells.  It has no effect on healthy cells.  You could put it on a healthy skin area and nothing would happen at all.  I am now at day 25 of application, making 2 applications/day.  The healing process has been amazing to watch, and I suspect I will be done in another week or so.  Could be sooner as the healing process seems to have accelerated the last 3 days.  I need to applaud the support staff at Remedy Hut where I made my purchase through Amazon.  They got back with me promptly, even checking in on me unsolicited to see how I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing,I will never go under the blade again.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS, and check with support if you have questions and you&#x27;ll be jsut fine.  I get a sense reading the negative blogs those users did not follow directions or possibly has an eggplant alergic reaction (mentioned in the instrutions).</li>
    <li> Excellent product to get rid of my skin cancer on the face, it took only three weeks of treatment, I  highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this on a confirmed squamous cell cancer on lower leg.  I only used it 17 days as the size of the wound and depth of the wound it was creating concerned me.  The wound did not look good and the pain involved with applying this cream was extreme.  It concerned me that I was causing more problems, so I discontinued use.  My dermatologist, after examining the wound, was concerned also.  I would not recommend this product from my personal experience.</li>
    <li> If one follows the instructions to the letter, the product will work. It takes time and continued application, and functions best on smaller spots in the early stages of development. It is no substitute for a dermatologist, which should be consulted when the condition is advanced. The cost is high, but it is still cheaper than Fluoroplex, a prescription alternative that may not be as effective.</li>
    <li> easy to apply, little discomfort, and quick healing time. 3 weeks till noticible clearing of leision. very easy to apply</li>
    <li> Well worth the money spent. I used this product for two cancerous spots on my back and in about two months I was done with my treatment. The healing is still going on and my back almost looks back to normal. The skin is just a little bit more pink yet. I started June 1, 2012 and was offically done applying it Aug 3, 2012. I was very happy with this and would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s on a budget and doesn&#x27;t have the finances to see a doctor. It takes longer but it works. The bottle appears small but it goes a long way. I even have a little left for future &amp;#34;test spots&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Curaderm is amazing..I used it on what the derm thought was the beginning of squamous cell on my lip and hate to imagine the deformity I would have faced had I not found Curaderm.  I have used it on several things, I have many, am pale, high risk and even some moles against their recommendation, but it removes it all and does actually kill the cancer.  The say no to treat potential melanoma even though it would kill it, because it could spread to fast, but I figure if my derm is not considering it suspicious and I have to wait 6 months to re-valuate, Why risk it, I can remove it in weeks with Curaderm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, all these creams on the market for age spots etc...Curaderm removes in days!!  It attacks the abnormal cells which is what thjey are and they literally fall off bit by bit!!  It&#x27;s crazy!! Once people catch on, this stuff will skyrocket in sales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do it, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trish</li>
    <li> This is a great product but it is important to know that if it is ordered through Bionational.com, it comes with customer support.  The one I received came from a different company and they do not have a support line.  When something is falling off your body, sometimes you want someone to call to affirm what is happening is supposed to be happening.</li>
    <li> I just started the treatment on a basal cell (confirmed cancerous) close to my eye. The spot is at least 3 years old. Yes, it burned. Yes, it&#x27;s red &amp; swollen after 1st day. Yes, I had to \\&quot;reconstruct\\&quot; the lotion, after receiving.  When I read the one star reviews, I am wondering if these people read the information and instructions from the real web site. All their complaints are addressed right there BEFORE anyone orders the Curaderm.</li>
    <li> I had been scheduled for &#x27;Mose&#x27; surgery to remove two increasingly ugly non-melanoma skin cancer spots from my forehead.  This was three years ago.  It would have involved cutting and stitching, and would surely have left a scar.  I found out about Curaderm on-line.  Cancelled the appointment and tried Curaderm - applying it three times a day for three weeks.  Result: job done.  No scar and my forehead shows no signs of ever having had any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been back to the dermatologist for this, but I have gained new respect for the damaging power of too much sun.  Regular visits to a good dermatologist is still prudent, to check out any spots or moles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curaderm certainly worked for me.  After the first few days it stings to the point of being painful, right after application.  But this goes away in a few minutes.  And it&#x27;s a lot less painful than surgery and stitches.  You&#x27;re ready to stop when healthy new skin grows over the treatment area.</li>
    <li> IM JUST TAKING A MINUTE HERE, I DON&#x27;T REALLY WRITE REVIEWS.  BUT I SENT THIS PRODUCT TO MY FATHER WHO WAS STARTING TO GET REALLY DARK SPOTS ON HIS NOSE AND AROUND.  THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM TO PROTECT FROM THE SUN SINCE IT LOOK LIKE BEGINING OF SKIN CANCER.  I SENT THIS CREAM TO HIM AND 4 WEEKS LATER HIS ALL CLEARED UP FROM THE DARK SPOTS .  HIS FRIENDS HAVE NOTICE IT AND ONE OF HIM ASK HIM ABOUT IT. SO IM GETTING ANOTHER ONE FOR HIS FRIEND !!!  I&#x27;M SO HAPPY FOR HIM..  I SAW DR. OZ TELLING ABOUT THIS CREAM AND SO I DECIDED TO TRY IT OUT FOR MY FATHER AND I&#x27;M SO GLAD I DID !!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now.  It does burn when first applied, but I like that in that I know what is a dangerous area.  I am 70, fair skin, never used sun screen and stayed outdoors a lot.  I had two MOHS surgeries July 3, 2012, one which required my nose to be cut down the center and one on my neck which required a 3-inch incision.  I then found out about this product, and ordered it promptly because the MOHS surgeon told me that two areas on my check needed to be removed by my dermatologist.  I had a total of 6 areas I discovered on my face that \\&quot;burn\\&quot; when the ointment is applied.  I don&#x27;t want any more MOHS surgeries and am so thankful to have found Curaderm.  Little by little the skin is peeling off and the burning is becoming less.  Yay!!!  I am so grateful!</li>
    <li> I had known a little about Bec5 for over two years, but was unable to find a dermatologist or pharmacist who had ever heard of it.  I was, naturally, a bit skeptical about a product that&lt;br /&gt;was virtually unknown, even to Medscape and other medical web-sites. At that time I appeared&lt;br /&gt;to have no lesions that required treatment. Moreover,by then, Imiquimod was available for&lt;br /&gt;similar use. Then, last August I developed what became a nodular basal-cell carcinoma on my&lt;br /&gt;nose. I was not keen about surgery (and probable skin-graft) for this lesion, so I resumed my&lt;br /&gt;inquiry into topical therapy, and found that Curaderm had emerged from its cocoon and had&lt;br /&gt;received the endorsement of some highly regarded professionals.  So, I decided to give it a try.  I applied Curaderm, according to instructions, for a bit over three weeks, and, by that time, there was no longer any visible evidence of the carcinoma, and the surrounding  skin cells appear quite normal. I may have a biopsy performed just to make sure, but, right now I&lt;br /&gt;feel confident that Curaderm has done its job and I am delighted !&lt;br /&gt;  Tracy E. Lay</li>
    <li> I have now used Curaderm 2 times. Once for a Squamous cancer on top of my head and currently for a basal cell on my temple. Worked perfectly, exactly as described both times. I should add that I have had 4 skin cancer surgeries on my my head and face including the Mohrs method once. I just got tired, scared and fed up with the Dr. telling me, \\&quot;We&#x27;ll just cut that out and you will be good as new\\&quot; Granted he did a very good job, but the pain, the scars and the puzzle work on my head was enough. The Squamous on the top of my head took the longest. I used the Curaderm just as prescribed, twice a day covered with the medical tape. It took 14 weeks and the dime sized lesion was completely gone and now, 10 months later, there is no evidence of any cancer or scarring or redness. Perfect! The second application of Curaderm I am doing as I write this review. This one on my temple again about the size of a dime. I went to the Dr. initially, and he said it was Basal cell and wanted to biopsy it immediately. I told him no and I would return in 6 weeks. I immediately started the Curaderm and in only 7 days there is only slight redness remaining and one tiny spot that I am still applying the cream on. I love this stuff. There were a couple of negatives for me. First is that there is a strong and definite stinging when applying the cream directly on the open lesion. This is normal. The second negative was that the first time I used it, I has some doubts and I wasn&#x27;t sure I should do it. Over the course of the 14 weeks, there were a couple of times the lesion looked worse and I almost quit the therapy. I thought maybe I was doing it wrong, but I&#x27;m so glad I kept going. It also does take some courage and strength of will to tell your Doctor that you are going to wait on the surgery and try some natural cream. It worked for me and it will be go to therapy every time I have the slightest indication of skin cancer in the future.</li>
    <li> I am in my 4th week of using the material on a BCC on my nose and a SCC on the back of my hand. It appears to be working as outline in the Eggplant Cancer Cure book.</li>
    <li> I am appalled that Amazon will distribute this product. The FDA has clearly stated that it is in violation of drug laws. My mother ordered this product and within minutes of applying it to her DIAGNOSED skin cancer lesions it caused a TERRIBLE chemical burn on not only the lesions but also on the surrounding healthy skin of her nose and mouth. Because of this burn her cancer treatment by an actual, reputable MEDICAL DOCTOR has to be delayed by several weeks while she heals the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am FURIOUS that this product is actually marketed to treat SKIN CANCER. Those who are truly foolish enough to buy this are victims of their error and of this fraudulent company. Skin cancer has a 99% cure rate if treated by a clinical professional (read: a board-certified medical doctor specializing in skin cancer treatment!!!), especially if detected early. This horrible product seems to encourage people to self-diagnose and delay real consultation with a doctor. The keratolytic substances in the cream are HARMFUL; they break down the skin&#x27;s protective layer, leaving it more open to infection and, in my family member&#x27;s case, painfully BURNED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is totally irresponsible, if not criminal, for this product to be sold anywhere.</li>
    <li> I am six weeks into the treatment and so far the results are amazing.  I had a very large basil cell growth on my upper arm that had been there for nearly 7 years.  It has flattened to below skin level but the new skin has not started to grow back yet.  According to the website, I still have six weeks left to apply (unless it heals before then) but the cancer is just a tiny little nub below skin level after being over 2 inches wide and nearly 1 inch tall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post again when I finish and verify that everything is done.  It did take a second tube as they are small and I was having to use a lot when the lesion was so large.</li>
    <li> It was easy to apply, however, I would have liked more detail as to how long to use the product.  Did start to tingle once my skin started to get raw but, it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  I would recommend this product, with reservation, only because I wouldn&#x27;t know when to tell the person when to stop using the product.</li>
    <li> I have tried curaderm for about four weeks  now on the top of my head where I have numerous sun damaged spots. the product has been more of a moisturizer than anything else. Pretty expensive one at that. I&#x27;ll use up the tube and hope for some improvement.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had read about it and my husband came home from the dermatologist&#x27;s after having several spots on his face frozen with liquid nitrogen.  I decided to try it.  I saw the same Dr. For my check-up and he wanted to treat one area on my ear.  I told him that I wanted to try the cream instead.  It is working on both of our faces!  I think it is working a bit better on me because I did not let the Dr. Treat the area first.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey but you only need a tiny bit twice a day.  I like to try natural alternatives before Big Pharma medicines when available.  I would highly recommend this to anyone with precancerous or cancerous areas.  It is working and it&#x27;s safe!</li>
    <li> Introduced to this cream 2 years ago&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by my dermatologist&lt;br /&gt;Never looked back since&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for clearing up Basal cell carcinoma (Skin Cancer)&lt;br /&gt;Although it sounds pricey&lt;br /&gt;One tube lasts for over a year&lt;br /&gt;It is excellent value&lt;br /&gt;I would not be without it</li>
    <li> The Curaderm products are wonderful and although they are a bit pricey are the best suntan product you can buy out there...also natural with no harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> I buy this routinely for my Father. He has several areas on his scalp that he  has been treating with Curaderm Bec5. We are all inpressed with the results, especially his dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Cannot see any difference whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;have used it for  several weeks&lt;br /&gt; A waste of money. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Concerned about a pre-cancerous Actinic Keratosis on my cheekbone, I tried dermatological Tretinoin cream and liquid nitrogen freezing, but the keratosis kept recurring. I learned about Curaderm on Internet at [...] and ordered it through Amazon, along with 2 accompanying products, Tamanu Oil and Micropore tape. Within 1 month the keratosis was gone, leaving no scar. It has been 4 months since then, without recurrence.  I was helped through the process by e-mail consultations with Bruno@CuraDermGlobal.com  - THANK YOU FOR CURADERM!</li>
    <li> I like this cream it seems to works as it was suposed to.  I had trouble with the post office but the company was very good and worked with me and made sure I received my cream.</li>
    <li> I saw information about this cream on Dr. Oz&#x27;s program.  My husband has had several places burned off of his face that looked pre-cancerous.  I ordered the cream for him for use on his face and hand.  I used it also on three places on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did not use the cream as recommended.  We only used the cream for three days (5 treatments).  It provided a slow burn, but not too painful.  It did burn off the supicious places that we each had.  I would never use as directed, only as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend buying the tape with it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product cuz I don&#x27;t have open lesions and did not realize that that what is needed to use this product.I assume it is not returnable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Curaderm Bec5 for several years now. When I find a site where what appears to be the beginning of a skin cancer I begin to apply Curaderm. Within two or three weeks the skin in the area of concern looks normal.</li>
    <li> I began treating two smallish cancerous lesions - one above my lip and one just under my earlobe back in August.  The first one appears to be gone after three months and I&#x27;m still treating the other one.  It&#x27;s much smaller than it was initially but I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s becoming resistant, it&#x27;s taking so long - that&#x27;s over five months now.  Maybe if I applied it more than two or three times a day.  Also, I haven&#x27;t been able to cover it because the bandage either kept falling off or it stuck so much that it was painful to remove.  I probably still have enough left to finish the treatment - I give it another month or so.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a scar, which is pretty amazing.  My face is full of them from where I&#x27;ve had other basal cell carcinomas surgically removed over the years - Mohs and otherwise.  Pros: it is painless, unlike the needles you get with surgery; it works; leaves no scars.  Unlike some treatments I&#x27;ve had (NOT Mohs) the cancers come back; Curaderm seems to search it out and get it all.  Cons: it takes a long time to work and it&#x27;s not cheap.  My health insurance pays for surgery.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product. BUT, it is not for everyone. You must expect to clean, medicate, and dress lesion 3,4 5 times a day for many weeks (for me it was 7). The lesion will get larger as you first use the cream. It looks a bit frightening. If you are dedicated and stay with the entire program, you will be rewarded. For me right now there is an area of redness, but all fresh skin. There appears to be no trace of the original bcc. I would use it again.</li>
    <li> We used this on a skil cancer my husband had on his arm.  When the instructions say not to get it on healthy skin you had better listen.  My husband rubbed alot on and then covered it with tape so it spread on the normal skin.  It made quite a large sore that took awhile to heal. However, the cancer is gone.  We will use correctly next time.  I think it is amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> I have no idea if this product works.  My skin became scaly and peeled, but I think that&#x27;s just because of the salicylic acid that is in the product.  Would not buy again.  I can get salicylic acid for a lot less than what Curaderm is charging.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I used Curaderm. It worked well the first time and worked well again. I like it better than using liquid nitrogen. It does not kill the tissue or leave a scare. I used it on my face and top of my head. It burned when I applied it, but only on the dammaged areas. After the dead skin peeled off, I was left with smooth, non-damaged skin. The product is expensive, but there are no buffers in it. It is very strong and I only needed a very small dab. It will last me a long time and therefore, I think it is worth the money. I will buy the product again when I have used what I have and I need it.</li>
    <li> After about five days after beginning treatment with Curaderm I was left with an ulcer at the site of my squamous cell carcinoma the size of a quarter. I continued the applications for four more days, but it was very painful and the pain lasted for a half-hour or so. I was hoping that the tumor had ulcerated away, but of course it hadn&#x27;t in that short time. In three weeks the area had healed at the periphery, but the center was red. Six weeks out and the tumor is obvious. I was hoping to avoid surgery, but it would be much less painful and much quicker than the use of this cream. I had expected a long haul treatment-wise, but not the tissue destruction.</li>
    <li> Curaderm Bec5 is an amazingly effective treatment if used correctly. I&#x27;ve had a couple of basal cell cancer spots surgically removed from my forehead and temple in the past, but since then I&#x27;ve removed a few more from my face over the years with Curaderm. In order to use it correctly, it absolutely must be used with medical tape such as Micropore. That&#x27;s what drives it into the skin. Simply dabbing it on and rubbing it into the skin will have only minimal effectiveness. Typically I&#x27;ve applied it twice daily during treatment periods, washing the skin first each time. Then, after applying a liberal dab of Bec5, I cover it with a small piece of Micropore tape. The tan tape works perfectly for me and is very inconspicuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape actually serves two purposes. The first, as mentioned, is that it greatly improves deep absorption of the cream. The second is that it helps cover red and inflamed skin at and around the application site, which inevitably comes with using this glycoalkaloid product. Treatment times vary. Although a spot may appear to be gone after a week, it&#x27;s usually wise to continue using it longer to prevent it from returning later. This will require some experimentation. It could take many weeks to fully eradicate a skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on skin irritation: Expect the skin in the treatment area to become very inflamed, a little tender and to possibly ooze or bleed. Any weeping of fluid always occurred for me--if it did occur--during the first few days only, but reactions will vary. The skin may be reddish-purple in a spot that&#x27;s about double or triple the size of the area you&#x27;re actually treating, as cancerous cells in the surrounding area die off, as well as the problem spot itself. At minimum, expect a lot of redness and irritation that will pass over the course of treatment. However, as ugly as it may look in the treatment area for a while, this is just a temporary state. In my experience, when it heals in a few weeks, it is completely scar free and looks healthy and normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price for a small tube of cream may seem high, but compared to the cost of medical procedures to remove a skin cancer growth, it&#x27;s a tremendous bargain that allows you to treat at home. I would highly recommend this to anyone who would like to try something first before resorting to conventional treatment. Just be sure to use it properly and know what to expect. In the past I&#x27;ve seen YouTube videos of people documenting their treatment. If any are available, it would be wise to view them so you have an idea of how things go during treatment.</li>
    <li> I had previously ordered this from another vendor on 1/20/13 and still have yet to receive it. Since I&#x27;m in great need of it I ordered here, and received it in 2 DAYS!!! I had a seller question that I emailed prior to ordering the product that was answered within an hour. Excellent customer service for a product that really works - thank you for carrying this!!! :)</li>
    <li> Product works...takes a little longer than stated, but cancer area looks good.  One more to treat and one still working on.</li>
    <li> I used this for several months on a sore that would&#x27;t heal on my forehead/temple area.  I followed instructions exactly, even emailing the company if I had questions.  It left a big hole in the skin, but I didn&#x27;t get any new skin growth.  Then the area started to get bigger with strange bumpy skin.  I finally went to a dermatologist and after a biopsy, found out that I had squamous cell cancer.  I had Mohs surgery done and the cancer was so deep (down to the bone) and wide, I then had to have reconstructive plastic surgery and radiation!  Also I can no longer move my right eyebrow because of all that had to be removed due to the cancer.  I wish I had just gone to the dermatologist when I first noticed the spot, to have it removed, instead of trying to treat it myself.</li>
    <li> I have a golden retriever who was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma.  She is not a young dog, as she just turned 12. So, I was given surgery as an option, but undergoing surgery with anesthesia is always a risk, especially at her age.  I did some research online, and came across information about Curaderm.  I decided there were no down sides, and if it worked, would be a much better option than surgery.  I was told that even if surgery was successful, the cancer could return because there may be microscopic cancer cells that would not be seen by the veterinarian.  I started the cream a few weeks ago and WOW, it is really working well.  This morning, as I was cleaning the spot, actual pieces of skin were falling off.  And, the cancerous area is apparently larger than the vet thought, so this really did end up being a better option,  I highly recommend it, even for dogs.  Also, I found that none of the vets I know are aware of this product, but they all want to know and see how it turns out.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful for small basil carcenoma skin problems. Both my husband and I have used it with excellent results.</li>
    <li> I stated using the cream on a very small spot on my neck below my ear that would scab over then not heal , after a few months I did some research and determined that it maybe cancerous. After researching that possibility and reading about the typical treatments I decided to buy the Curaderm. After applying it to the spot it expanded to about the size ofa quarter and scaped over the entire area where I applied the curaderm with the suspect spot now expanding to the size of a pea from the size ofa flaxseed. Because of the research I had done I was not surprised. I continued applying the curaderm twice a day as recommended and after aboout 3 weeks it is now completely healed with no scar or anything. Thank you Curaderm, it really does work.</li>
    <li> It appears to have worked on a basil cell carcinoma on the back of my neck. My dermatologists had suggested excision or mohs surgery which I have experienced before on spots on my face and ear. I decided to try the cream after seeing it on the Dr. Oz show. I used it as directed for about 2 and a half months. My wife did the applications using just a tiny amount on the end of a Q tip. It did sting! To the surprise of my dermatologist at my check up, the skin cancer was gone! My doctor had never heard of curaderm but she did look it up on her computer in the examination room. If she had an opinion about curaderm she wasn&#x27;t willing to share it with me. I will continue using it on any suspicious skin areas that appear and hopefully reduce the number of future surgeries to zero!</li>
    <li> This product does work.  In my experience, it does take longer than stated.  I have used it for 5 spots.  Not for those who can&#x27;t tolerate pain.  While the lesion is an open sore, applying the product is similar to putting rubbing alcohol on a wound.  Burning is severe and lasts for at least 1/2 hour.  Then pulling the tape off is also painful.  However, much less cost than going to physician for the alternate &amp;#34;slice and dice&amp;#34;... and you get a much larger area treated.  In my experience, a small pencil eraser sized spot will expand to an open, oozing wound approximately 3&amp;#34; in diameter.  Did get some scarring on one spot, but think it was more to the tape pulling my flesh off than the Curaderm product.</li>
    <li> I have been watching a small spot on my hand for 5 years. It alarmed me.I used this product and it is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the micropore tape as someone advised. I&#x27;m glad I did because I did not see it in my pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;I also made the mistake of not shaking the tube so didn&#x27;t get active ingredients until 3 or 4 days in. I put way too much on and then added the tape which spread it even further so I ended up with what felt and looked like a chemical burn. All is well now. I figured it out but just wanted to let people know so they don&#x27;t repeat my mistakes.</li>
    <li> Yes it works. The basal cell carcinoma on the back of my hand was a good test because it was old (some 10 years since last medical treatment) and big (3x3 cm on the surface). My 4-star rating is not because of the product (which I give 5 stars) but because of the insufficient information that comes with it. So here goes my experience, which hopefully will help you with your own treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all I recommend that you get a medical diagnosis of what type of skin lesion you have. This cream is powerful, nothing to play or experiment with, it&#x27;s meant for basal and squamous cell carcinomas, and keratoses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the basic treatment: twice daily applications of the cream, one around 7 am, the other around 9 pm. The first step was to wash the lesion. I never used soap, only warm water. I never scrubbed or rubbed it too much. If there was pain, my washing was very basic and superficial. If not much pain, I rubbed it a bit stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would then dry the lesion and apply an antiseptic solution (I used liquid, not gel). For this I laid a gauze on top of the lesion and applied the liquid until the gauze was soaked. I left it there for a couple of minutes. Then I would lift the gauze, fold it to make it smaller, and softly rub the lesion with it. Then I would dry with another piece of gauze. I applied the cream directly on the lesion. However, as mine was big, I would then spread it with a finger. Having done this, I covered it with a 3M micropore tape. I never skipped a session, I did it twice daily for 52 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hurts. My BCC was big, perhaps it hurt more than smaller ones, but still you have to be prepared for pain. The first week you might even feel that you will not be able to stand the pain for many weeks. Keep going. You will start getting accustomed to the level of pain, and in fact the pain diminished notoriously by the time I was halfway through the treatment. Never forget you are dealingwith a cancer, it has to hurt a bit, and you will get rid of the cancer if you continue with the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesion swells, and so does all the area around it. In my case this was no great problem, in fact I was 3 weeks into the treatment before I noticed that my hand was swollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is normal (and a good sign) that a whitish, yellowish or brownish matter comes out of the lesion. These are the malignant dead cells being removed by the body. Focus on removing this matter when cleaning the lesion. The area around the lesion reddens. This can be confusing. At the beginning I wasn&#x27;t sure if these could be malignant cells reacting to the cream or irritated normal cells. Keep applying some cream over those borders. If you notice depressions, holes or craters forming in that area, it means you are killing malignant cells there, so continue applying the cream until they close. However, you might see instead a layer of some white stuff starting to cover the area. This was the most confusing part of the treatment for me. Was I supposed to remove that white layer or not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the treatment advances, a depression or &amp;#34;crater&amp;#34; will form where tha cancer cells have died. However, my lesion was bigger than average, so I had all the superficial area (3x3 cm) eaten away by the cream and then some 10 to 12 separate craters formed over that area. In fact, as I kept applying some cream over the borders of the lesion, the malignant area extended to 5x5 cm. This is probably one of the best things of using Curaderm: it reaches malignant cells that are not visible on the surface. Had I had my BCC removed by surgery, probably a 4x4 cm area would have been removed, and therfore the cancer would have returned because malignant cells cells remained beyond the extirpated area (which is what always happened when I had this BCC burned or removed by surgery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s go back to that tricky white layer that forms. You will notice it easily. It is awhite layer that you can peel away. That&#x27;s what I did at the beginning. But I kept feeling that the white stuff was either related to new healthy skin, or it was just the cream that &amp;#34;dried&amp;#34; in areas where there were no malignant cells left to absorb it. Be it what it may have been, I soon stopped peeling that white layer away, although some parts would peel on their own when I washed the lesion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will reach a point in which the craters stop growing and then start closing. Keep applying the cream to them and their borders, but at this stage I stopped applying any cream to the areas covered by the white layer. When to stop applying the cream? When your last crater has closed. It will be easy for you to notice when this happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me 52 days. I finished the treatment about 4 weeks ago. The skin in the treated area is slightly pinker than the rest of the hand. But it&#x27;s still in the healing process. I suspect that in 1-2 months this tint will have dissappeared completely. As for scar(s), no, the treatment left none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, 1 tube of Curaderm should be enough, unless you have a lesion 5x5 cm or bigger. In my case, which ended up being 5x5 cm, I used a tiny bit of a second tube.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why I haven&#x27;t heard more about this product!  I found the curaderm product in &amp;#34;The Encyclopedia of Pragramatic Medicine,&amp;#34; put out by the Health Alert Store, that sells Standard Process Products. Why this product is not well known as a cure for Basal Cell Carcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinomas I will never know!!  So if you have read this, now you know!!!  Curaderm gets rid of cancers on the face where you want No scarring.  Compared to going to a doc for treatment-there is no comparison.  Curaderm usually sells for $126.00 a tube and you may not even need all of the tube!!  Compare that to going to a doc for a small removal and you will pay $800 and up!!  The downside is that it takes a while to work(7-70 days), and can sting when used!  A small price to pay when you know the cancer is eradicated for good, with no scarring!!</li>
    <li> It is great for removing pre cancerous brown crusty spots that we get from sunning so much.  Worth the price.</li>
