<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Purchased it about 1.5 months ago, its working good so far, family and friends see a difference in new hair growth, its given me more confidence, and it feels better walking in public</li>
    <li> So far I really like dasgro. I have tried others and was dissapointed but this one has been working... yes, actual new hair growth but don&#x27;t expect it overnight. If you&#x27;re experiencing hair loss and want something that really works then I recommend doing this for 3 months to really give it a chance.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a teenager I had horrible hair it would be dry one day greasy another it was just horrible it was also very fine and thin. Things got worse as I aged and my hair started to fall out. I was so scared of going bald and I started to try all sorts of treatments, remedies and products. I tried dasgro hair formula on a whim but was shocked to see that within a few days of taking the product I had some early signs of progress. I stopped taking all other products and did the dasgro 3 month program. I am here to tell you all that this is the real deal! I have experienced a full transformation... hair went from THIN and patchy to FULL and filled out! This product is a real life changer and more people need to know about it.</li>
    <li> It has only been a few weeks but the results are showing some promise. I have a thyroid problem which has affected my hair in a negative way. Dasgro seems to be helping and I really like that it’s natural with no fillers or preservatives, a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> Simply the best product out there for hair growth! I have been thinning for years and have numerous products and treatments. As soon as I started to use this product my hair stopped thinning and started thickening up. New hair growth kicked in and filled in the balding areas!! This product is amazing and I am so happy I found it!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and was really excited to try this product.  With age my hair has become less glossy and just all around not as healthy as it use to be. When I read the reviews especially from cancer patients I was thinking this must be a good product.  At the time I was taking over the counter biotin ( very affordable) and was starting to see some very positive results.  Biotin was suggested to me by one of my friends who is a nurse.  Well because this product had so many positive reviews and cost more I thought it might work better than biotin. But after using it for about 30 days I noticed that my hair was very dull and dry looking. I kept trying to drink more water thinking maybe that would help but then it hit me that I had gone off my biotin and started using this product.  Needless to say I went back on biotin and about two weeks later I saw very visible positive differences!  Maybe this product may work for someone else but it honestly seemed to dry my hair out more. So I could not recommend this product.  I can only give it a one star, a one star means you hate it.  I do not hate it but definitely do not recommend it. I would never use it again.</li>
    <li> After getting a bit older I noticed my hair started to fall out. At first I didn’t think much of it but then when it kept getting worse I really worried and decided to try and do something about it. My friend recommended trying out this product and told me it worked for them. I am a bit of a skeptic by nature but felt I had nothing to lose and tried it out. I am glad I had enough sense to give it a go because shortly after starting on it my hair texture, length, color and thickness improved and kept getting better. My hair shedding is all but gone and my hair hasn’t looked this good in years. This product has been wonderful and it has truly worked for me. If you’re balding or thinning or just want something preventative then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> This seems to be working ... I have less hair falling out and it looks healthier.. IM on my second bottle i see come new growth.. I will keep using</li>
    <li> This product has completely transformed my hair for the better. Not only is it thicker and longer but the color and shine have gotten considerably better too. I am happy that the formulation is natural and I feel good using these knowing that they won’t be causing me harm. Thank you for such a great product!</li>
    <li> This made my hair grow longer than it has in years. I feel like my skin and nails have also benefited. I have not used anything else during this time which tells me this product is actually working. Whether you have hair loss or just want to improve your existing hair this is the real deal and will help with both.</li>
    <li> I’m getting older and my hair has been thinning for a few years now. I wanted a natural formula that wouldn’t cause side effects and was fortunate enough to find dasgro. I took it to my doctor and he gave me the go ahead to use it. I just finished 30 days and my hair is no longer thinning and I can see in the mirror that it’s thicker. I am very pleased with it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I wanted something that was safe and effective… this did the trick! The biotin and other ingredients in this have had a tremendous positive effect on my hair and scalp. I would recommend this product over the others… I find it works much better than many others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Hair loss runs in my family but it was still a bit of a shock when my hair started to fall out. I began to bald and felt like I should at least give some things a try before saying goodbye to my hair forever. After doing a ton of research I stumbled on the DasGro Hair product and decided to give it a shot. In all honesty I was a bit skeptical and cautious but couldn’t help but notice that after 2 months new hairs started to grow in the thinned out areas of my scalp and that my hair started to grow back! It was not an overnight process, it took some time before the initial new hairs popped out but now that they have it seems to be happening quicker. There has been absolutely no reversal and it appears to be permanent hair growth. I am still a bit shocked but not going to complain. This is truly an amazing product and has been a blessing.</li>
    <li> DasGro Hair Formula has helped restore confidence in my life!  You see, losing hair can be a deathblow to a young gentleman like myself.  My head is very strange looking and without hair it looks goofy as hell.  DasGro has helped me shed fears of losing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it all before.  I would stop wearing hats because I heard it accelerated the hair loss process.  I tried Rogaine and got no results besides a greasy head.  I even went the prescription drug route and only got sexual side effects.  Nothing has worked like DasGro!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in my early 20&#x27;s I started to notice that my hair was falling out more rapidly.  This was obviously very distressing because I looked amazing, and my hair was incredible.  Through the years it started to get worse and worse until I decided to take action.  You can imagine my added distress when I found that none of the other solutions worked.  On a whim I decided to give DasGro a try because it was so inexpensive and didn&#x27;t have anything to lose.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more thrilled with the results.  The beauty of DasGro is that its ingredients are all natural, so there aren&#x27;t any side effects.  I just took the product and sat back and let it do it&#x27;s magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DasGro started working very fast and my hair already looks better after only 2 weeks!  I have not only experienced a thickening of my current hair, but also have started to see small areas of regrowth!  Seriously this stuff is impressing the hell out of me.  My understanding is that DasGro Hair Formula works at different rates for different people.  Luckily for me, it kicked in fast.  I&#x27;m going to continue taking DasGro for the recommended 3 months and check back in with another update when I&#x27;m done.  I&#x27;m just so excited about my initial results I had to write up a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen, if you are experiencing hair loss problems and haven&#x27;t had much success with anything else, do yourself a favor and give DasGro Hair Formula a try.  You can thank me later.</li>
    <li> As a model hair means a lot to me as anyone&#x27;s hair should. But with all the hair products I use my hair starts to constantly shed and its very worrying. I didn’t have a lot of money so I wanted something affordable and effective. I saw dasgro and said to myself what do I have to lose. Fast forward a few months and it has completely stopped my hair loss and I have even noticed my existing hair looks better than it did 10 years ago!!</li>
    <li> I got this because I was losing hair very fast and I wanted a natural product that wouldn’t cause issues. I found dasgro hair formula and was very impressed when I stopped losing hair and saw little hair growing back in less than 30 days. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So here is my personal experience on this product: It worked well for my husband and I. Both of us started to see a difference with less hair shedding and hair thinning. Hair growth is noticable. Didn&#x27;t make us feel weird like other pills, easy to take and swallow, and not too expensive. will update my review if I want to add anything else.</li>
    <li> I love how this product uses 100% natural Ingredients. I hate not being able to pronounce half of the ingredients on the label but with this one I can read every single one! More importantly the product has made an improvement in my hair. It&#x27;s getting very thick and I have less hair loss now! Which is great because my hair is normally thin and shows my scalp. I will recommend to others for sure.</li>
    <li> I never left a review for any kind of product but with DasGro I have too. I finished my 3 bottle today and I am back to reorder. I&#x27;ve had such a bad hair loss about 3 month ago. I didn&#x27;t even wanted to brush my hair anymore. DasGro stopped my hair loss after the first month. I went to my hair dresser a couple of weeks ago and she couldn&#x27;t believe how full my hair is. This product works. Give it a try you wont be sorry.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN ON IT FOR 2 MONTHS. RESULTS ARE GREAT, HAIR LOOKS AMAZING, MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS COMPLIMENT ME AND WONDER WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING. THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
    <li> My doc told me to try this after I had a reaction to a different product. These work and don’t cause issues. If you’re worried about side effects then I highly recommend trying out this product. It has made my hair grow and it’s no longer falling out like it used to.</li>
    <li> DasGro Hair Formula is by far the best natural hair growth product I have used to date. I have tried so many things and nothing really helped but with DasGro I feel and see a difference and I am not the only one either! I would definitely recommend this product for someone with hair loss. I have alopecia and it has been a life changer for me.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to find an effective natural solution but it finally happened with dasgro! I was shocked and pleased to see new hairs growing at the top and sides of my scalp… both of these areas are problem areas for me and this is the first I am seeing any reversal of hair loss. I love this product so much and hope for continued success with it. I would recommend this to others in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> This product has helped me regrow my hair. I no longer have to wear my hat every day and feel proud of my hair. I feel so many people take it for granted and I did too until I lost it. I never will again and I am glad to have found a product that has helped me get it back.</li>
    <li> In the last few years I have gone through all sorts of treatments, pills, oils and shampoos and sadly very few products have helped and some even made things worse. However, this one has stood out from the pack. It has produced the best results of any natural hair growth product that I have tried to date. My hair grew longer, and the thinned out areas thickened up quite nicely. I have now dropped every other product and just use this; the results continue to impress me. As far as natural hair loss remedies this one is the best… and that’s coming from someone who has gone through 20 or more hair products.</li>
    <li> Great product, works, is natural and doesn’t cause side effects. Huge plus for being made locally in the US in and FDA approved facility. If you have hair loss or want to improve the thickness, texture and length of your existing hair then this is the product you need.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical but tried it anyway and I just wanted to say that it does work. I have a pretty horrible hairline and this has already made noticeable improvements. The rest of my hair is thicker and feels softer. This product has definitely exceeded my expectations and I am happy to have found it.</li>
    <li> After just 2 months my hair is finally growing back in! I have alopecia and was so worried that nothing would help but this product has made the biggest difference… not just my hair but in my life! I feel more confident and find that I am not as worried about what my hair looks like because it looks great!</li>
    <li> Does nothing after a month. On to the next thing. Makes my pee super yellow if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into.</li>
    <li> I love that my hair has started to grow again and it’s all thanks to dasgro! I’ve been going crazy trying out one product after another and I couldn’t be happier with the development and progress that I have achieved in such a short period of time. I will finish my full 3 months and plan to update the review and share the long term results then.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff… just 6 weeks and the difference it has made in my hair is incredible. It looks amazing, so much thicker than it used to be. It’s growing faster and the texture is amazing. I really needed this, THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I have stubborn hair loss near my temples and have tried everything under the sun with very little to show for it. What shocked me was the progress I noticed when using this product… just 10 days in I start seeing tiny little hairs growing back on my scalp and then a week later I start noticing they are growing out and thickening up. I feel like everyone should try this. it is so damn effective compared to other things I have tried.</li>
    <li> Have been taking for 2 months, so far no results except my urine has turned a nice bright yellow color.</li>
    <li> Being older you start to lose hope that anything out there is going to make a difference but I tried this on a whim and boy did it deliver. Just a few weeks of using this and I started to notice tiny new hairs growing on my crown and they continued to grow as the weeks went by. Now it’s been a few months and my hair is looking amazing and I still can’t believe what I am seeing when I look in the mirror. Don’t pass up on this amazing product, it really works!</li>
    <li> I am almost finish with my third bottle and I really don&#x27;t see any hair growing back in my bald spot. I am thinking about trying something else to see if it works for my ALOPECIA! I really would like to wear my own hair.</li>
    <li> It has been working for my alopecia, great product.</li>
    <li> I received it on time. Not convinced it works</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make a bit of difference.</li>
    <li> Very glad I found dasgro before it was too late. I was losing so much hair per day that I thought I would need a wig soon but after using this product I found my hair started to recover and stopped falling out at such an alarming rate. I am pleased with dasgro and urge others to give it a try.</li>
    <li> This worked for me when nothing else has. I did the full 3 months and noticed progress every month. Started a bit slow then ramped up towards my second bottle. Give it the full 3 months for best results.</li>
    <li> I purchased dasgro hair formula because I was impressed with the amount of quality ingredients in it and like that it is GMP certified. I just feel better when I know the product I am consuming has gone through some sort of quality check and is safe for consumption. The really good news is that I did start seeing progress with it very quickly. Thin areas thickened up, bald areas started getting some hair growth and existing hair became healthier. Overall I am very happy with my purchase of dasgro and I’ll be purchasing this product for as long as I keep seeing results. Thank you for such an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I tried so many things for my hair over the years that I don’t want to even think about the amount of money I spent. This is the only product that seems to have made a difference for my alopecia. It’s still too early to go in depth about the full potential of this product but the early signs are there and have given me something to look forward to.</li>
    <li> I ordered dasgro and it arrived very quickly. I took it right away and after only 7 days started noticing positive changes. There is definitely less hair falling out now. Super excited to see the results in a few months.</li>
    <li> ALLERGIC TO IT!!!!!!!COULDN&#x27;T TAKE IT HAVING ADVERSE REACTIONS TO IT, DISCONTINUED USE. TOOTSIE</li>

    <li> I love this magical product that save me from embarrass about lose my feature beauty is my thick hair from shredding away. I&#x27;ve noticed that I was losing hair when I was 27 yrs. I never given a thought why I was losing my hair such a young age. Anyway two yrs ago, I was diagnosed GERD and Inflammation that caused me to lose my hair dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lose my hair was a death to me. So, I decided to do something about it in order to save it. I searched for solution to restore hair loss and regrows area. And came across to this product and purchased.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken dasgro hair formula twice along with biotin vitamins again twice for 2 1/2 weeks now. First week results was no improvement but into two weeks progressively it&#x27;s improving very well. It less shredding and growing back fast. Which I am very happy with this product and will continue buy more for my hair is full recovers as it was before.</li>
    <li> I know that this product is supposed to take time but I started seeing results in only 8 days!!! I obviously didn’t grow a new head of hair but my hair feels and looks amazing. I am impressed with the results especially because I’m a bit older too and wasn’t expecting anything to work this fast.</li>
    <li> I’m always vacuuming up my hair, it’s so bad but after using dasgro my hair has stopped falling out, just a few hairs here and there but nothing like before. This is a great product and I encourage anyone experiencing hair loss to try it.</li>
    <li> I have been losing hair to the point of balding and took this product to counter the effects. I noticed my bald spot has slowly been filling in with new hair. At first it was just tiny small hairs but after using it for a few more weeks the hair has become thicker and longer.</li>
    <li> There is no use with this product, didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> I can tell my hair is stronger its not falling out like it used to. I love this products.</li>
    <li> Best hair growth vitamins I have ever used! I just switched from another brand and it was the best decision ever. My hair grows longer, has more texture and is softer to the touch. I also noticed my skin has improved which I wasn’t expecting but not going to complain about that!</li>
    <li> I lost a lot of my hair due to stress and life circumstances. I started using this and a lot of my hair loss has started to reverse. I haven’t had this kind of hair in years and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I noticed my hair started to grow after a week. I have thinning all over the top of my head and it’s already becoming less apparent. The tablets are very easy to digest and I just take mine in the morning with my orange juice and breakfast. I have no reactions or side effects and I am not taking any other products or medications at this time.</li>
    <li> Been using almost 3 weeks. So far no real change. I am going to give it a few more weeks and I will write an update after I finish the 2nd bottle. Wish I could give a better review but just being honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update....I now have been using this product about 5 weeks and finally I&#x27;ve noticed it began working. Almost done with the second bottle and my hair is still falling out but not like before. It&#x27;s ALOT less! I was losing up to 200-250 strands a day but now it&#x27;s less than 50 a day thank goodness! Hopefully if you give it a chance it will work for you. I just ordered my 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> This product has really helped my hair.  My hair has stopped falling out &amp; I have noticed new hair growth.  I would highly recommend this product. However you have to give it some time to work. It took about 4-5 months for this product to actually work.</li>
    <li> used one bottle; not sure if it helped</li>
    <li> My hair has been falling out and I was getting embarrassed about the potential of going bald. I used this supplement because it’s natural and since it was recommended by my dermatologist I figured it might be worth it. Lucky enough it started to work as soon as I began using it and within days I noticed less hair loss. Within weeks my hair fully stopped falling out! I’m beyond impressed and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I almost didn’t buy it but very glad I tried it. My hair stopped falling out within a week and now on week 3 and seeing some positive changes in hair growth and texture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an amazing experience using das gro hair formula! There is not much I can take due to a sensitive stomach but das gro is one of the few things out there that doesn&#x27;t cause problems...it&#x27;s a natural product and my hair loves it! Not only has my hair stopped falling out but in recent weeks I have taken note of new hair growth in different regions of my scalp that have been losing hair over the years. I love love love it and will order it forever!</li>
    <li> I just about passed up on this product… GLAD I didn’t. It really works! I’m talking no more hair loss and hair growth in all the right places. No unibrows or facial hair, just hair growth on top of my head where I want it.</li>
    <li> Worked for my alopecia and hasn’t given me side effects. I tried other products but this one is by far the most effective.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for stopping my hair loss and helping me get back my hair I used to have! I will be ordering more for sure.</li>
    <li> I lose a lot of hair and worry about it constantly. I started dasgro to help control the issue, since then the hair loss has slowed down and my hair length is longer and the texture is better.</li>
    <li> Works, will be ordering more! Highly recommend to others looking for something that truly works.</li>
    <li> i was drawn towards it as its the only FDA approved, been using it for months, no difference or improvement yet i continue using it.</li>
    <li> I shed hair constantly but once I started using dasgro hair formula my hair shedding reduced to almost nothing and after a couple weeks I noticed my hair started to grow in many of my problem areas. I am very pleased with what I am seeing.</li>
    <li> Over the year my hair started falling out due to lack of sleep and job stress. My doctor recommended DasGro Hair Formula so I got on their site and ordered it. Since then I have slowly seen my hair come back to its former state. It has become much healthier and I actually find myself stressing out a lot less simply because I’m no longer losing my hair. This has made such a big difference in my hair and my life. I like that it is natural, my body does not react well to anything with chemicals which is why I guess my doc recommended this. It was a good call because it has truly worked and my hair hasn’t looked better in ages. This is easily the best hair growth product that I have used and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for something that works and something that is safe and gentle on the body.</li>
    <li> It works and has no side effects. My hair is growing past its plateau, it’s thicker and the color has improved too. I was a bit hesitant at first but now Im glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! I have been using this product for 2 months and my bald spot at the top of my head is almost covered with hair</li>
    <li> It works for me, tried so many other product and this one actually does work. This is a great natural product that won’t cause side effects. Buy it and try it!</li>
    <li> My hair is coming back after adding this to my daily routine. I also eat a lot of protein and avoid drinking as I hear both things can help with hair growth. I will order again and will recommend DasGro to others.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I am seeing new hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a couple weeks and I’m starting to see some positive effects on my hair. The texture, softness and length have improved. So far I like it.</li>
    <li> Works well on my second bottle and my hair is noticeably thicker</li>
    <li> Very good!! My hair has been damaged from different products… dasgro has helped restore my hair very quickly. I am proud to show it off again! If you want a hair regrowth product that is worth the price, this is it.</li>
    <li> was not very happy with this product at all could just be me but it made me feel very drugged up when taking kinda like a borderline hallucinogenic stop taking right away but as far as shipping and receiving it was right on the money.</li>
    <li> It grew my nails and made them stronger, made my face oily, and a lot more dandruff. But not a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> Finally found a product that works as advertised! I can’t believe how well this stuff works and how quickly it has kicked in for me. The hair growth is amazing! It will make your hair grow and thicken up. I just ordered some more and plan on using this for at least 6 months, I’ll report back when I am done.</li>
    <li> It helped reduce my hair loss and my hair is growing faster than normal. I feel my overall hair is healthier and feels much thicker and fuller to the touch. It’s easy to take and doesn’t cause me any issues.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair &amp; skin look fab. I take them w a meal or else they make me nauseous. Just purchased my 2nd bottle</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work waste of money</li>
    <li> I started my bottle as soon as it came and within a few weeks started to see a noticeable difference in the mirror. Less hair loss and new hair growth near the hairline area! This product is the real deal and works great.</li>
    <li> After a ton of research I decided on DasGro Hair Formula for its natural ingredients and the fact that it’s made locally. My decision paid off and after 3 months of use I saw a full transformation in my hair. Everything from texture to softness to length to color to overall health showed improvements. It’s a night and day difference, in a good way! I even stopped using it now and the results are sticking around, no signs of reversal and no side effects what-so-ever.</li>
    <li> It helped my hair grow longer. It also feels fuller, stronger and doesn’t fall out at the same rate. It has replaced many other products in my daily regimen so I’m actually saving money using this product!</li>
    <li> After 7 days I can see a difference in my hair. The shine, texture and length have all improved and when I run my hand through my hair I’m not seeing as many hairs coming out. I’m stoked to see what my hair will look like if I use this for a few months.</li>
    <li> A few members of my family use this including myself and all of us have had varying degrees of success. It does seem to work at different rates though, some of us saw results quicker than others but ultimately we were all happy to see that the product was effective.</li>
    <li> So far so good after 30 days I can tell a difference in my hair. I got the 3 months supply and will use it for 90 days as recommended. I take both my tablets in the morning but was told I can do 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon but just find it easier to take both at once with my breakfast.</li>
    <li> Before actually deciding to buy it, i looked at the ingredients on Amazon. It showed a lot of Vitamins and Green Tea extracts. I was amazed at how yeast is an ingredient also. Kinda crazy, but anyway its very easy to take, just two a day with your meals, pretty dang simple!!</li>
    <li> I seem to have got that from gentics. So my hairstyle has had to adapt to hide the balding spots. Unfoturnelty its gotten worse over the years. I decided to try and see if this actually works and if its not just a scam. I&#x27;m very happy to say it does work! And i seem to be growing my beautiful hair back!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I now exclusively use it just because I find it’s the most effective for me. If you’re looking to get longer, thicker and healthier hair then this product really delivers. I take mine every day at the same time with breakfast and again with lunch, you only need to take 2 tablets per day and that’s it.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using 5 months with amazing results. The hair growth has been steady and shows no sign of reversal. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product has transformed my hair from thin, lifeless hair with a massive bald spot at the top to full, thick and filled in spot in 4 months. It has transformed my hair and my life and I couldn’t be happier. I strongly recommend this product to anyone who wants results and is tired of all the junk out there.</li>
    <li> I ordered one bottle to give it a try and was surprised to see how it has worked for me. I’m impressed and happy to see that my hair is getting fuller and thicker and not as much hair loss as before. It will be interesting to see what it can do for me when I take it for a few months. So far though it’s been really good.</li>
    <li> This is a great product from a great company. I have been ordering for over a year and I continue to benefit from the effects of these amazing tablets. My hair hasn’t been this healthy or long since my teens and that was a LONG time ago. I also want to mention that the customer service is superb and any time I had a question or concern they answered quickly.</li>
    <li> I’ve been taking dasgro hair formula for about 3 months now and I’m happy to report that it has exceeded my expectations. I was balding badly, the scalp was showing and within months have experienced a reversal of years of hair loss. Glad I found this product when I did.</li>
    <li> I observed hair growth on my third week, right around the edges and at the top. I’m delighted and thrilled that I have finally found a product that does what it’s supposed to.  It has been a small investment for a big pay off!</li>
    <li> I wanted a natural product to help with my hair loss and found dasgro after researching the best natural hair growth solutions. I am happy to say that I can see why it’s so highly recommended. It has reduced my hairfall and just yesterday I started to notice my first signs of new hair growth! This is the real deal and a must have for anyone suffering from hair loss.</li>
    <li> Impressive product, love the natural ingredients and that it’s made locally in an FDA facility. It has really helped my hair shedding and even helped regrow some hair on my scalp. I really wish I knew about this sooner but glad to have finally found a product that works for me.</li>
    <li> Actually works! I was a tad bit skeptical but wanted to try it for myself. Within days I felt and noticed a difference on my scalp. I measured progress on a daily basis and after 2 weeks there was no denying the changes. I’m going to continue on the 3 months program and feeling hopeful!</li>
    <li> After trying so many product I was shocked to find that this one actually helped me grow my hair back. I really have no words for the happiness I feel. I would recommend dasgro to anyone with hair loss or baldness, this product really does work.</li>
    <li> I’m constantly worrying about the potential side effects of products which is why I wanted to try dasgro hair formula. The product uses natural ingredients and since it’s manufactured locally I figured it was a safe bet. To help relieve my paranoia I still took it to my doc to have it looked at and got two thumbs up… well not literally but the doc said that it’s worth the try. I started the formula and at first not much happened but then about a week into it I started feeling a tingling sensation. Nothing annoying or serious and it did go away, then I noticed my hair wasn’t falling out as much. I keep tabs on the amount of hair I find around the house and I could tell it was less than normal. I also have very thin hair and on my second week the hair thickened up. Back to the side effects… good news! No side effects and I am finishing up my first bottle. The people at dasgro recommend 3 months so I’ll be doing that but so far I’m really liking it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Amazing for thinning hair! It thickened mine right up and improved the texture and shine. It doesn’t cause any side effects and is a great alternative to creams, oils and shampoos. No mess, no fuss and you still get great results.</li>
    <li> Happy I tried it. I have tiny new hairs growing… kicked in quickly and haven’t noticed any side effects. Worth the money for sure!</li>
    <li> My hair has been growing like crazy. I usually have a hard time growing it past a certain length but this has really given it that extra little bit I’ve been hoping for. I love the way my hair looks and feels now.</li>
    <li> On my third week I was running my hand through my scalp and felt some tiny new hairs! Went to the mirror, took a closer look and BAM I see hair growth. This is the first time I’ve had a product for hair growth actually grow hair so I’m happy to say that it’s working.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thin hair and have been balding for a while now. I used&lt;br /&gt;the dasgro product and have been getting great results. My thin hair is&lt;br /&gt;getting thicker but more importantly I am getting some hair growth action&lt;br /&gt;again! This is an absolute must for those that want a safe alternative to&lt;br /&gt;other hair loss treatments.</li>
    <li> I really like the natural ingredients in this product. I was happy to learn that it’s manufactured in the US and that all the ingredients are locally sourced. As far as results, they have been the BEST results of all the products I have tried to date. Seriously, nothing works this well. Hair is super thick, texture is amazing, softness is there and it’s longer than ever. I have some thin areas and those are filling out nicely. It’s been a decade since my hair looked this good. This product is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Since using dasgro I noticed my hair has grown out longer, thicker and is overall healthier. I have also noticed less daily hair loss. Best part is I have not experienced any side effects and will be adding it to my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I believe the product was working. But the reason for the 3 star rating is because I was experiencing nausea and diareah. It started a couple days into taking them, so I tried giving it a couple weeks to see if my body would adapt, but it couldn&#x27;t handle it. I think it&#x27;s the overdosing of vitamin A (200% daily value is too much). It&#x27;s a good product, but my system couldn&#x27;t handle it. Everybody is different.</li>
    <li> I had a nasty looking bald spot at the top of my head and started taking this product to remedy the problem. After several month I’m happy to say that this spot is no longer there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and has now been replaced with new and health hair. I was a bit skeptical at first but now very glad I ended up trying this.</li>
    <li> My hair looks amazing after a few months of using dasgro hair formula. This product is worth it and has exceeded my expectations and it’s easier to use than shampoos or oils and far more effective.</li>
    <li> The results have been incredible! I had a bald patch that has completely filled in over the last 2 months. My existing hair has become fuller, softer and looks absolutely amazing in comparison to what it used to look like. This product is really worth it and I wish I found it sooner!</li>
    <li> I have alopecia and was worried that there was nothing out there that would help. I used dasgro as a last resort, it came highly recommended by many so I figured why not. I was not expecting much due to disappointments in the past but have to admit that I started to get excited when after 1 month I noticed some hair growth. On my second bottle the progress continued and surely but slowly my hair is starting to regrow. I can’t put into words what a relief this is and how happy I am that there is a product that really works!</li>
    <li> This one really works! I was so tired of trying product after product and each one would do nothing but dasgro truly works! My hair was so badly thinned out you could see the scalp and after several months using dasgro the hair loss reversed, healthy hair started to grow and is filling in nicely!</li>
    <li> I have been using these tablets for almost 30 days and so far I’m pleased with the progress. I see less of my hair around the house and can see a bit of new hair growth when looking in the mirror. The product is recommended to be used for at least 90 days so I plan to do that and update this review then.</li>
    <li> Only used it about a month and haven&#x27;t seen any significant new growth of hair in my thinning area but will use it for couple of month to see if it works or not.</li>
    <li> Noticed gradual progress from month to month which is more than I can say for a few other things I’ve tried in the past. I like the product and it is working, can’t complain :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken a half bottle, and really haven&#x27;t noticed many benefits yet.  Will comment again, after I finish the bottle. I gave it 3 stars because a good percentage of other reviewers seem to have noticed the growth benefits, and I trust a lot of the reviewers recommendations on Amazon.  Not all them though, however the reviews for this product seem genuine, so I&#x27;ll give it another shot.</li>
    <li> I’ve been slowly balding for 10 years, some from stress and some hereditary. I tried out this product because it came highly recommended and although this didn’t produce overnight results it did prove to be highly effective at restoring and rejuvenating a good chunk of my lost hair. I do recommend using it for at least 90 days though so you get the real benefits. In my case it took some time but it paid off big time!</li>
    <li> STOPPED MY HAIR LOSS AND HAIR IS GROWING STRONG AND HEALTHY!</li>
    <li> I have to stop taking DasGrow formula because It gave me terrible headache and nausaous!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, hair is thicker, longer and growing much faster. It really thickens up your hair so if you have really thin hair like me then this will help with that. No side effects in the time I’ve been on it.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been thin ever since I can remember… tried dasgro and in a few weeks my hair started to thicken up. I’m still in awe when look in the mirror and can clearly see that the hair is thicker and fuller.</li>
    <li> It was overkill for me to take a multi-vitamin on top of this, as it has so many nutrients in it.  So, can be taken as one&#x27;s multi-vitamin.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate the stomach, though, and otherwise a good value.</li>
    <li> I tried every major brand of hair loss product and then stumbled on this hidden gem. I say gem because it works like nothing else out there. On first glance it looks like just a bunch of vitamins but after some research there is a lot more to this product than just the ingredients. This product releases essential ingredients over a period of time and the ingredients are higher quality than in most products on the market. Everything is sourced locally which I love to hear. Among the high quality vitamins there are herbs that have been used in alternative medicine for years, which you won’t normally find with just any other vitamin product. You can tell the company did their research and made a product that is quality and it’s reflected in the results that are achievable. I am walking proof of what’s possible and a customer for life! For those wondering this has reversed 6 years of hair loss in 4 months and I am still seeing positive effects, better yet all this without any side effects.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Works very well for me! I got it for FREE around one month and so far my hair improved a lot. My hair is thicker now, it looks more healthy and natural, and new hair grows, it&#x27;s really awesome! Will definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I came off a popular brand due to side effects which caused itchy red scalp. Tried dasgro next and did not get any side effects, better yet my hair started to grow. My hairline started to show great signs of improvement and is now considerably thicker. This product is a must for anyone dealing with hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is easily the best hair growth solution I have ever tried. My hair has been steadily growing and has stopped falling out. The shine and texture are amazing! I love it and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> After a week I noticed a reduction in hair loss, after 3 weeks the hair loss was down to a bare minimum, on the second month I experienced hair growth (just the scalp) as well as improved texture, thickness and shine.</li>
    <li> Its been three weeks and not a noticable difference yet. Might try a second month</li>
    <li> Have been taking these for several months and the results have been absolutely amazing. Before using these I had bald patches and thin whispy hair... it was depressing and looked horrible. In my first week I started to get results but I was shocked to see that after a few months hair started to regrow. To this day it&#x27;s still growing, no signs of reversal and no side effects!</li>
    <li> Absolutely nonsense. It did absolutely nothing for me, my daughter, granddaughter, nor a friend of ours.</li>
    <li> I will try this soon I love that&#x27; it will help my hair grow and see the difference  will be fantabolous</li>
    <li> Wow, dasgro made my hair THICK. It used to very thin, frail and was always shedding. Now it’s really improved in every aspect and the difference is noticeable to me and others around me which have started to make positive comments and wondering what I’ve been doing. Thank you dasgro!</li>
    <li> If you’re worried about side effects then this is the product for you. Not only are there none but for me this product proved to be very effective at stopping my hair loss and helping me grow back most of my hair around my hairline. I had a very horrible hairline and it would bother me when I would look in the mirror. Since then my hairline has grown out and looks much better.</li>
    <li> I am a big skeptic when it comes to these types of products but gave this a chance and was quickly blown away by the fantastic results I experienced. My hair has thinned out over the years and within weeks I started to notice it was thicker and growing faster. I notice less hair in my drain and on my pillow which is awesome! I’m very pleased with this product and glad I decided to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I constantly worry about side effects since I’ve had some using other things. I was drawn to dasgro hair vitamins for the natural ingredients and after using them can honestly say this product works like magic! I didn’t dream of having my hair grow back and was only hoping to stop it from getting worse but dasgro has truly exceeded my expectations in that regard and as far as my main concern with side effects, it didn’t cause any!</li>
    <li> I have tried every major brand of hair growth product out there and DasGro Hair Formula has produced some of the best and most permanent results of all those products! It has filled in a huge bald spot I used to have. It did not happen quickly but over several months, still this is amazing and I just wish I had found it sooner so I wouldn’t have wasted all that money on other stuff.</li>
    <li> I’ve become jaded over the years trying out different products that did little to help my hair loss. However, I found dasgro hair formula to be one of the few products that truly made a difference in both reducing my hair loss and improving my existing hair. As far as new hair growth it’s been slow but steady. Overall I am very happy with it and in all honesty it has exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> It’s packed with the nutrients that your scalp needs to grow back hair. I noticed new hair growth on my second bottle and it’s showing no signs of regression. I am still in shock and awe at the results that I am seeing in the mirror. I honestly couldn’t be happier and wish I knew about dasgro when I first started searching for a solution.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really give an opinion just yet. I have been using this products for a whole month and I don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair. The shedding/thinning has continued and hasn&#x27;t stopped. I bought a three month supply and I will continue to use it just to see if the results will change. Customers rant and rave about how good this product is and I am waiting patiently to see. I will be back in another month with another update. Hopefully I will have some different results. This is month two of this product and I still see no results to the hair shedding. I have not seen any results and I have been using this product as instructed. I am disappointed and I will use this product until I have completed all three bottles that I purchased. If still no results I will be requesting a refund.</li>
    <li> I used to get a ton of dandruff and hair loss and was desperate for a solution. I heard about DasGro on a radio talk show and decided to give a try. My initial impression has been very positive, my dandruff is gone and hair loss has already slowed down to a point where others have noticed the difference. Because I’m no longer losing as much hair it looks much thicker and has given me a much needed confidence boost.</li>
    <li> If you want fuller, longer and healthier hair then this is the product you’ve been searching for. Trust me, I’ve tried many and this one is the only one that was able to deliver any tangible results. I love my hair now and feel my confidence has improved tenfold.</li>
    <li> DasGro Hair Formula has been a part of daily routine for nearly 6 months. It has replaced every other hair product I was using before. My hair stopped falling out and looks 10 years younger… I only take one a day now but it still produces great results</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical but gave it a full 3 months and absolutely LOVE what it has done for my hair. I get so many compliments now and those who haven’t seen me in a while are shocked at how different I look. This product really works but be patient because overnight results are rare with any product and hair growth can take some time BUT it’s totally worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews &amp; did a lot of research before buying this product. I only take one pill a day because I eat super healthy and juice a lot now because I&#x27;m trying to heal my intestines, and I don&#x27;t want to vit A overload. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the amount of hair that falls out. I have had more than 200 hairs a day for the past few years-scary amounts, now, only a small-more normal amount!!! I&#x27;m gonna take this product for a year since I think it may be attributed to a vit deficency. Then come off and see how I do. I highly recomend this product for anyone loosing hair. Now my visions of long beautiful hair may come true, like when I was younger.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect product for me. It has helped my hair grow and not much else has. I like that its natural and that it hasn’t caused me any weird side effects. </li>
    <li> Hair loss runs in my family so a few of us decided to give this product a trial run. The good news all of us have seen some pretty impressive results in the first 30 days the bad news is we all want more and I am the one stuck with the bill.</li>
    <li> My hair is actually growing back! I’m still amazed at the results, it has done wonders for my hair and it’s only been 2 months. DasGro has far exceeded my expectations and I’m a true believer now!</li>
    <li> i think this product is only meant to provide necessory supplements. Existing hair does grow fuller and thicker but it does not grow new hairs or reverse the hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is just a deitery supplement thats priced too high by a false claim to reverse the hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have used all 3 bottles as per their claim and right now on 4 th bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that surprised me is that all the reviews are linked with their website and even all the amazone reviews too.  there are companies out their now a days who manipulates reviews for similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how can amazone allows such bullshit? isnt it a fraud by amazone?</li>
    <li> Great for hair loss, alopecia and hair thinning all the while it contains no chemicals, fillers or preservatives. I’m happy with my hair now; this product has helped tremendously and I definitely recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> In order to see results use them for 1 year. If you have had a bald spot with no growth for over 1 year, most likely it will not help.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. I CAN’T SEE MYSELF WITHOUT THIss MAKES MY HAIR LOOK GREAT. GET LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS ABOUT MY HAIR.</li>
    <li> Wow, that’s all I can say. What a wonderful product, just weeks in and my scalp and hair are already responding to the dasgro tablets. I can FEEL the hair wanting to grow and the improvement in texture is clearly noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have a very deep widows peak and a bald spot towards the back of my head, or I should said HAD. This product has reversed so much of my hair loss that I barely look like the same person. I know it sounds too good to be true but my personal experience has been amazing and I feel proud to show my hair in public again.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a product that works! I love dasgro, I love that it’s natural, I love that it doesn’t cause side effects but most of all I love the results I have been getting since I started. My hair is growing for the first time in years and the hair shedding is almost non-existent. I definitely recommend getting the 3 month supply to save some money, totally worth it!</li>
    <li> It made my hair twice as thick. The patchy areas no longer show my scalp and my hair has increased in length. My hairstylist noticed and mentioned it to me and friends and family have made some positive comments too. I really love this product, thank you!</li>
    <li> Not sure yet! Need to use it a little longer.</li>
    <li> Great value and fantastic results. Nothing else I’ve tried so far has been quite as effective as dasgro hair formula. I love it and plan to use it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Best hair growth product I have used to date and I have tried quite a few of these types of products. I like the ease of using tablets as opposed to creams and oils and it WORKS better too.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried about side effects as I had a bad experience in the past with another product but so far no issues on DasGro. The results are good too but I still need to give it more time to get to where I want my hair to be. Overall I am very satisfied and will be using these on the regular.</li>
    <li> In all honesty I was a tad bit skeptical but decided to go ahead and try out this product and have not looked back since. I was so worried I was going to be bald but after several months I have seen an amazing turn around and now have more hair than I had in high school. I couldn’t be happier and recommend this product to anyone who needs a little (or a lot) of help with their hair situation.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, natural, and works quickly. I restored my hairline in 3 months using it. My initial results started 10 days in and just kept going… way quicker than I expected.</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients! They help my hair stay healthy and many of them are good for other aspects of health too. This is much better than any mutli-vitamin because it actually targets the scalp first and distributes into the body overtime allowing it to be more effective than most other products out there.</li>
    <li> I was shocked to see how much this product helped me with my hair. It’s typically dry, flat and lifeless but now it’s fuller, thicker, shinier and just overall healthier. This did more for me than any shampoo or conditioner ever has.</li>
    <li> I almost didn’t get it but people kept telling me to try it. Well I DID try it and to be honest it has done amazing things for my hair! I have pattern baldness and this has tremendously helped reverse years of damage to the point where I am nowhere near as self-conscious. I receive compliments and get tons of curious people asking me what I have been doing. This product is amazing and I couldn’t be happier!</li>
    <li> Wow, I looked in the mirror the other day and couldn’t believe that my bald patch had some new hair peeking through. I all but gave up but feel very confident that this product will deliver! I will come back and update my progress at the 1 month mark but so far so good!</li>
    <li> Product works and doesn’t cause any weird side effects. I take 1 tablet with some food and water in the morning and then do the same in the afternoon. The bottle will last you a month which I find is great value for the money. This is definitely one of the better products out there for hair growth.</li>
    <li> Made my hair thicker, fuller and has helped it grow a few extra inches. I absolutely love this product and use it every day.</li>
    <li> It hasn’t been an overnight solution (I didn’t really expect it to be) but there is no denying that it has reduced my hair loss and improved the rate of hair growth.</li>
    <li> Thanks to this product I have a hairline I’m no longer embarrassed about. It’s incredible the changes that a natural product can produce but I’m walking proof that it works. If you have a receding hairline or want to prevent further recession then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> When I hit 60 I started to lose hair very quickly… it was a bit of a shock because I’ve always had great hair. My son found dasgro and told me to try it… well, it was a great idea! My hair reacted quickly and at first I noticed my hair didn’t fall out everywhere and less of it was on my pillows. Then several weeks later I started to get some hair growth new the hairline and around the temples. It has kept on g rowing and still is… Very happy to see something work, I was worried that I was going to go bald but dasgro saved me and I am glad my son found it for me.</li>
    <li> Been three months. Not sure im seeing much of anything</li>
    <li> I have alopecia and was recommended dasgro hair formula. I wanted something natural and safe and so I ordered it right away. I was surprised to see how fast I started to FEEL the results… that’s right, it felt like my scalp was a bit tingly, this sensation went away after 2 or 3 days and several weeks later I started to see tiny new hairs all over my scalp. After several more months it continued to grow and thicken up and the results have been absolutely outstanding. I plan on never stopping dasgro and I feel this product needs more attention, it really does work!</li>
    <li> After years of hair loss I’m here to say that my hair is finally growing again on some of my thinned out areas. It hasn’t been an overnight solution but then again I wasn’t expecting it to be. It’s great to see that the progress has been steady and consistent and that my hair has not regressed back to falling out.</li>
    <li> I wasn’t to the point of balding but wanted something that would give my hair some length and volume. I was surprised at how well this worked for and wish I knew about it a lot sooner. I will be ordering more soon, thank you.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It has gotten the hair loss under control and hair appears thicker. No side effects or any unwanted hair growth in other areas. Easy to swallow, and don’t have to take 14 pills like some other stuff out there… with this it’s just 2 a day.</li>
    <li> I worry about the types of products I consume because of all the potential side effects. I was drawn to dasgro hair formula for its natural ingredients and because it came highly recommended. I wasn’t to the point of balding but did need some serious help with my existing hair. I found the product provided improvements and benefits within the first 2 weeks but it really started to come through on my second and third month of using it. My hair is fuller, stronger and no longer falls out like it used to. The color, shine, and length have also seen improvements. I absolutely love the product and during this whole time I have not experienced one negative side effect. I will be ordering more and urge others to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I can’t believe it! My hair is growing fast and I see tiny hairs popping up all over the scalp. I had a friend who noticed it the other day she started wondering what I’ve been doing to make it grow! I couldn’t be any happier and pray it continues to work for me!</li>
    <li> DasGro Hair Formula has done an amazing job at turning my thin and brittle hair to nice thick and luscious hair. My friends and family have all noticed the difference and I couldn’t be happier.</li>
    <li> I came off a few other products due to side effects and replaced it with dasgro hair formula. I like that the ingredients are safe and it doesn’t cause any problems. The results have also been significant and I notice my hair isn’t falling out like it used to. It’s thicker, longer and healthier. I would recommend this to anyone with hair loss.</li>
    <li> After trying nearly everything out there I was just about ready to give up when I came across the dasgro hair vitamins. I read everything I could on it and decided to try them having exhausted all other options. I took the tablets as directed, 2 per day with food, very easy to digest so no issues there. At first I thought that nothing was happening and was worried this wouldn’t work for me. After about a week I started to get this tingly feeling in my scalp that lasted a day or two and went away. It didn’t hurt or itch or anything but it just felt like a tingly sensation like my hair follicles were “waking up” Long story short it’s been 3 month and the difference this product has made in terms of hair growth is incredible. Those who know me are shocked and ask me about my “secret” I love this product and I am a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I was shedding hair like mad and was on a one way path to becoming bald. This product helped me get my hair loss under control and in fact has helped me restore some of the areas that had the most hair loss.</li>
    <li> Hair Feels Stronger..Too Soon To Tell If It will work..</li>
    <li> Starting to see some new hair growth happening! It hasn’t even been 30 days yet… awesome results!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I have just started my second bottle and have been noticing new hairs. My existing hair has also improved which is awesome! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have horribly thin hair and in 30 days my hair has gone from thin to thick, VERY IMPRESSIVE. I highly recommend dasgro hair formula for thinning hair. I have not experienced any side effects… but have noticed that my skin has improved as well!</li>
    <li> I was told by many that nothing could help my hair loss and that I would just have to “deal with it” but this product has honestly given me hope. I started taking the 2 tablets per day with food and water and noticed results in just a few days and now within a few weeks I can see new hairs coming out and growing. I have not done any other changes in my day-to-day routine so I know that this is actually working for me.</li>
    <li> As someone with alopecia I thought I was doomed but to my surprise found this product helped with reducing the hair loss and thickening up my existing hair. While I was showering I noticed some new hair growth around my head, can’t tell you how excited I got but it wasn’t there before that’s for sure! I’m hopeful and happy with the results, some hair is better than no hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my purchase. I&#x27;ve been losing my hair for awhile. I love this product. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle and I see results.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for 3 months and seeing new hair growth every week. it has also done a nice job strengthening my existing hair.</li>
    <li> I have finished my 3rd bottle and feel like my hair looks 10 times better than it did before I started. My receding hairline and balding patch have new hair that has filled in those areas quite nicely. I did not experience any side effects and found taking 2 tablets a day was easy enough. I recommend trying this out it’s been an absolutely wonderful product for my situation and has helped me so much.</li>
    <li> These pill works i notice my hard got stronger and it was starting to grow but unfortunately  i just couldn&#x27;t  afford  to buy a bottle every  month so i stop i wish  to start again using  it</li>
    <li> I lost a bunch of my hair over the last 4 years, it wasn’t looking good. I began taking this product in the hopes of stopping the hair loss. I was pleasantly surprised when it not only helped stop the hair from falling out but also helped me regrow much of the hair I’ve lost over the years. Based on my experience I strongly recommend anyone losing their hair try this product.</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning to the point of my scalp showing, not good. I started taking dasgro hair formula and slowly but surely my hair began to thicken up and is now at the point of thickness where the scalp doesn’t show. I consider this a great success so far and would definitely recommend anyone with thinning hair to try it!</li>
    <li> I found this formula to be highly effective at reducing my hair loss. Just a few days ago I noticed my hair started to grow out on an area that hasn’t had hair in years. I’m beyond excited and will be sure to come back and update this review in a few months. Thank you so much for such a great product.</li>
    <li> I was in distress because I was going bald and it was happening fast… I started using dasgro and within weeks it started to reverse the damage… new hairs all over the scalp… thicker existing hair… faster hair growth! Wow, I couldn’t be any happier with this product.</li>
    <li> I’m generally a skeptic when it comes to these types of things but dasgro has surprised me. The results have been apparent from the start and are still going even after 1 months of use.</li>
    <li> Works really fast! HAIR IS GROWING and hair loss is less noticeable. I have very thing hair so glad this is helping!</li>
    <li> I love these hair vitamins. They make my hair grow quickly, the volume and texture are awesome! I have been using them for several months with no side effects, used to use another product that caused pimpled but no such issue with this product.</li>
    <li> I tried so many hair growth products and can honestly say this one has proven to be the most effective! It is the only product that has produced substantial hair growth on my scalp. I have alopecia and was told nothing would work but I’m definitely seeing results with dasgro!</li>
    <li> I have stubborn hair loss and in less than 30 days I noticed a large reduction in shedding and tiny new peach fuzz hair growing!</li>
    <li> Awesome results after 2 months. I don’t normally write reviews but felt compelled to write something after my hair started to grow back on a dormant area of my scalp. It looks plenty thick now and for the first time in a while I went outside without my hat. I’m now on my third month and have yet to get any ill effects. I highly recommend it for those dealing with hair loss!</li>
    <li> It really works! I have used it for several months and used to have really thin hair to the point where you could see my scalp but since then my hair has grown in thicker and I can finally go outside again without feeling self-conscious about it.</li>
    <li> Wow, the results have been miraculous… iam one happy customer and love the product… It’s longer and thicker than it has been in years. I love getting compliments and curious people who have seen the progression and now ask what I’ve been doing to get my hair to look the way it does. This is one product you do not want to pass up on and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Havent seen any results yet</li>
    <li> My hair was getting worse and worse… finally I decided to try some stuff and eventually got this. Long story short this product ended up working and my hair is finally growing again. It has given me some hope that I will not have to wear a wig. Thank you and I will update this in a few months.</li>
    <li> AWESOME RESULTS WITH THIS PRODUCT! I’VE NOTICED HAIR GROWTH AFTER JUST 2 WEEKS OF USING IT. NO SIDE EFFECTS AND IT’S EASY TO TAKE. I WILL BE ORDERING MORE AS SOON AS THIS BOTTLE IS DONE.</li>
    <li> In the mirror this morning i saw my new hair where hair had never grown there since i was 5 years younger. I was graciously offered a free sample to test out what i thought might be just another scam. Thankfully it wasn&#x27;t at all, i love DasGro the stuff is pretty sweet.</li>
    <li> It works!!! After 30 days it has transformed my wispy, frail hair to thicker and much stronger hair that no longer falls out. I love the extra fullness it provides and my hair looks awesome on it. This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone dealing with hair loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical when ordering an expensive product with mostly five star reviews, and sure enough if you check all the five star reviews on this product - they ONLY review this product, aren&#x27;t a verified purchaser which means they didn&#x27;t buy the product on Amazon, or have just given a few products all five star reviews.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with alopecia 2/3/2015 and went to my dermatologist to get steroids shots on my balding area. To my dismay, my bald spot kept getting bigger. I was DESPERATE to find something that worked. I found DasGrow and have been using it for the past two months. The spot stopped growing and new hair is growing in as well as around my hairline. My hair is thicker overall and feels and looks so healthy. There are no side effects and I see a great improvement in my skin and nails as well. I love this product! it is worth every penny! I would definitely recommend this product to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have been using castor oil and thickening shampoo and conditioner. I believe in battling alopecia from the inside and out. it is a devastating disease but this product does help!!! try it!!!</li>
    <li> I love the natural ingredients and feel much safer taking a product that is made locally. After about 6 weeks I have noticed an amazing transformation in my hair. I have alopecia and this is helping me get my hair back!</li>
    <li> I am a few months into using dasgro hair formula and have noticed my hair is growing much faster and coming in thicker and shinier. For someone with thinning hair this is such a relief and im very happy to have found a product that works for me. I am not taking any other supplements but try to keep a healthy diet, lots of vegetables, fruits, juicing and a good amount of protein.</li>
    <li> In my first month I did notice many improvements but mostly in my existing hair but that all changed when I was about half way through my second month and noticed hairs growing in on a bald area of my scalp, mind you this area has been bald for YEARS and not a single hair has been seen there since it got that way. But there it was… new hairs! The feeling is difficult to put into words but I’m so excited to see the new hair growth that I want to jump up and down and scream! I’m too old for that so I won’t but I find myself smiling all day since I noticed it. I LOVE this product and highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have stubborn hair loss so I didn’t expect to see results as fast as I did. It’s only been 3 weeks and the hair growth has already started and is clearly visible on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I have been balding at the top of my head and began using this product based on a recommendation. I honestly didn’t know what to expect but was surprised to see the improvement it was able to make in the crown area of my head. The balding is barely noticeable now due to the new hair growth in that area as well as the existing hair thickening up that has helped make it less obvious.</li>
    <li> Just started a week ago but hair seems thicker and softer already. Its nice to see something happening this fast. So far there have been no side effects and the tablets are easy to consume with no odor or bad taste.</li>
    <li> It made my hair thicker and improved the texture and shine. My friends and family all noticed… didn’t take long, about 2 weeks to see initial results, did not get any side effects. There are only 2 tablets and that’s it, easy to swallow and no issues.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t tell the difference</li>
    <li> Before I started I had badly thinned out hair which exposed my scalp in many areas. I used this natural formula for 3 months and my hair began to fill in all over the thinned out areas. It did not happen overnight and I would recommend doing the 3 months to really get the best outcome. Patience is key and in my case has paid off big time!</li>
    <li> These were recommended to me by a friend… I needed something to help with the hair loss and luckily have seen some amazing results.  I am no longer losing hair and it’s giving me the much needed confidence boost. Great product and even better results.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 30 days, and already i can see results!</li>
    <li> I have many medical issues and have to be selective with what I put in my body. I found these tablets caused no issues but just as importantly they have proven to be effective at stopping my hair loss and helping me thicken up my thinned out hair. This is a great product and I will be ordering more as soon as I’m out.</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing a slowly receding hairline over the last 5 or so years and started taking dasgro hair formula 3 months ago to combat this. In those months I have experienced some incredible results. My hairline is no longer receding and actually has been restored to what it used to be many years ago. I just ordered more product because I don’t want to risk any reversal effects but was told that I may not have to even take it anymore! Anyways, this product really works and I wish I knew about it much sooner but like my mom used to say it’s better late than never.</li>
    <li> I was getting to a point where a wig was becoming an option… I tried this product as a last resort and feel like my prayers have finally been answered. My hair stopped falling out and regrowth started to take place shortly after (maybe within 2 weeks). This product has been a life saver and has given me hope that I won’t need a wig after all. As far as side effects, I noticed nothing that would concern me and feel like this is probably the safest of the products out there.</li>
    <li> Hair loss is something that runs in my family and it’s something that has really affected my confidence over the years. I was desperate for something that would help me and got this product and I haven’t looked back since. I got about 60% of my hair back in the past 3 months and my existing hair is stronger and thicker than it has been in years. This stuff seriously works and I have been recommending it to everyone!</li>
    <li> It works and has helped me with restore years of hair loss in just a few months. I love the way my hair looks and feels now and would recommend it to others. No issues with side effects or anything else.</li>
    <li> Everyone in my family is either bald or getting there. I have alopecia and tried this product for its natural qualities and because I really didn’t want to go bald. Well, it’s been a few months and I have seen some extraordinary progress. New hair growth all over my scalp on the second month which has continued on since! My family is amazed, everyone is ordering some! Thank you very much for creating this product and thank god I found it in time.</li>
    <li> I struggle with growing my hair past a certain point and figured I would try a few different products. Eventually I tried DasGro after a few failed attempts with other products. DasGro made my hair gro! No pun intended. I love it and recommended to anyone who wants faster hair growth!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a revive yet check back later</li>
    <li> I highly recommend dasgro hair formula, it has works wonders on my hair and has provided much needed nourishment to my scalp and hair. My hair has changed for the better and I feel and look 5 years younger. Good stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This product has proven successful and helping me put an end to my rapidly shedding hair. I find my hair is much stronger and stays on my scalp like it should! Hair growth was apparent in month two and a few people have complimented on my hair recently which is great reinforcement that it’s working.</li>
    <li> When I opened the bottle, all of the supplements were cracked, split open.  I&#x27;ve never seen vitamins in such horrible shape!  I can&#x27;t use them and find nowhere I can contact someone about this problem.</li>
    <li> I was desperate and tried many things to try and slow down my alopecia. The last thing I thought would work was a tablet but DasGro Hair Formula has truly been the single contributing factor that has made the biggest difference. I stayed on it for 5 months and was able to grow back a big chunk of my hair! It’s incredible; others can barely believe it until they see me and see the amazing changes that have occurred. Last but not least, the product has cause zero side effects which was initially a concern for me. If you’re balding or are diagnosed with alopecia give this product a try and make sure to give it some time to work!</li>
    <li> Prior to using dasgro my hair was terribly thin and some parts of my scalp were starting to show. After using it my hair became fuller and thicker and covered many of the patchy areas of my scalp! I’m still in awe of the results I’ve seen and highly recommend dasgro to those balding or those with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I had a bald spot on the top of my head and a receding hairline. This product has helped tremendously, the bald spot is filling and the receding hairline isn’t so obvious. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I stumbled on dasgro hair vitamins when doing research on natural hair loss treatments. I tried it right away and within 7 days started to see a decrease in the amount of hair I was losing. I kept taking the product and each week I noticed an improvement over the previous week. I’m still using it and it’s looking good so far!</li>
    <li> Amazing product for stopping hair loss and helping hair grow back healthier and stronger. I have been using it for 6 months and will continue to use it. I tried other products but none of them have measured up to the results I have achieved with this.</li>
    <li> If you’re worried about side effects but still want something that actually works then I recommend trying out dasgro. The results have been amazing, my hair loss is at a minimum and the hair growth is definitely noticeable. I was just looking at my pictures from last year and I can barely recognize myself. This truly works and it won’t cause any unwanted side effects like some of the other more popular treatments.</li>
    <li> Great product and really works fast too! My hair is thicker and feels stronger than ever. I only wish I had started using it sooner.</li>
    <li> I tried to on a whim and so glad I did… before using it I was losing a HUGE amount of hair per day and was really worried. As soon as I started on dasgro I could see the hair loss decrease day by day and eventually it stopped falling out altogether. As I continued to use the product my hair began to grow and get stronger. I noticed my skin and nails improved too which is a big plus. My only advice is to allow this product time and give it at least 3 months.</li>
    <li> I was shedding hair at an alarming pace and was recommended DasGro Hair Formula by others who had success. I’m happy to say that it has been working and that my hair is not falling out like it used to. I feel my hair has thickened up and it looks vibrant and healthy.</li>
    <li> I am returning it...I am not sure what&#x27;s the hype all about. I&#x27;ve been shedding my hair like crazy since I started this :( .</li>
    <li> I love these hair growth vitamins, they keep my hair from being a total mess. Less hair loss, more hair growth, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I needed something that wouldn’t cause side effects but also something that actually worked. This product did it for me. I got results and I have yet to notice any side effects. I tried Rogaine and that was horrible for me and my scalp would itch but with this I am not getting any of that and the results have been very good!</li>
    <li> It has transformed my hair from flat, ugly and dry to thicker, darker and generally healthier. Side note, allow a few months to really get the most out of this and you’ll be one happy camper, I know I am.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several months and have noticed a compounding positive effect. It started of slow but now the improvement in my hair is undeniable. I get compliments everywhere I go… those who haven’t seen me in a while seem the most amazed. I highly recommend this if you are looking for a product that really works.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive stomach and found these to help with reducing my hair loss without causing any sort of stomach issues. I’m pleased and would recommend to anyone looking for a good alternative to harsher hair loss treatments.</li>
    <li> This product restored my hairline! I’ve been using it every day for 4 months and the difference is incredible. I used to have a deep widows peak which has been reduced to almost none existent. My first results started in a few weeks but I would recommend using it long term since hair growth does take time and expecting a full head of hair overnight is probably not realistic. That said, with patience this is probably the best natural product that there is.</li>
    <li> It’s a great product and has given me great results and no side effects. Works best when used long term but did see results in first month. I take 2 tablets in the morning with food, tablets are easy to swallow.</li>
    <li> I’m grateful for this product, it has stopped my hair loss and has made my hair much thicker. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not only have I completed the recommended 3 months and seen no difference whatsoever but I&#x27;ve called and emailed dasgro multiple times to initiate the refund process and I&#x27;ve gotten no response. Maybe now that I&#x27;ve left a bad review I&#x27;ll get a response. Their customer service 800 number is a waste of time. No one ever answers the phone it&#x27;s just a recorded message referring you to the support email address that they never don&#x27;t respond to. I can attach screenshots of the multiple emails sent if anyone wants proof that they don&#x27;t respond.</li>
    <li> Dasgro formula made my hair thick and shiny.</li>
    <li> I saw a difference in 3 weeks and just ordered 3 more months. I have tried other products before and this one is the only that has worked without causing side effects. The early results look promising and I only hope that it continues to go this way. If you’re looking for a safe alternative to the other stuff out there then try this product!</li>
    <li> After several failed attempt with other products I have finally found success with dasgro hair formula. My hair is growing and the thickness is unbelievable. I love what it has done for my hair and wish I had found it sooner. I would urge others to try this product before anything else.</li>
    <li> Its my 4th week. I do see my hair on pillow not that much. I will finish 90 days. Than can tell difference . Because my hair is already thin. I want to grow more hair.</li>
    <li> I have been taking DasGro Hair Formula for 2 months and have experienced a drastic change in my hair. The texture, length and thickness have all improved. I can also see new hairs coming out near the hairline and on top.</li>
    <li> My names  started  growing  really like long starting  from the first week...</li>
    <li> After dozens and dozens of products, remedies and treatments I can finally say I found one that works. This product is the answer to my prayers and has helped me regrow my hair after years of hair loss from stress and surgery. I cannot express my gratitude for this and I’m happy that there are products that produce real results. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Great for thinning hair and doesn’t cause side effects. The natural ingredients are all locally sourced and I appreciate that it’s made here so I know it’s safe. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is losing their hair or just wants to have healthier hair.</li>
    <li> I have been diagnosed with alopecia and tried several products with no luck. I stumbled on dasgro and while I had no expectations I was pleasantly surprised to see that my scalp reacted in a positive way and within a few weeks I started to notice some hair growth. From that point my scalp continued to grow new hair, and this new hair was not falling out. At this point I was excited and continued to use the product religiously for the new few months. I’m not 5 months into using it and the changes have been nothing short of a miracle! This whole time I have not experienced a single side effect, just incredible. I wish I had found it sooner and I hope it helps many others with their hair loss!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would stop my hair loss and maybe thicken up my existing hair but I was not expecting what happened next… new hair growth, all over the scalp. These hairs are sticking around too, and growing out! No signs of reversal… wow! This product is the a real deal, a must have for anyone with hair loss problems.</li>
    <li> I received an open bottle with about 35 pills inside.</li>
    <li> If you’re looking for a product that will help regrow your hair then try this one! I have alopecia and was worried nothing would work, still I tried this because hey why not. A few months later my hair started to grow back out, wow!! No side effects during the whole time using this.</li>
    <li> In 2 weeks my hair has become thicker and stronger. When I pull on it I get no hair coming out which is something new for me. I have not experienced any side effects and it’s super easy to take, 2 tablets a day and that’s it.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST hair growth product out there. I have used every major brand and tried every home remedy I could find and this has been the one product that has delivered tangible and REAL results. No signs of reversal and the new hair continues to grow out.</li>
    <li> After 2 months I have been able to achieve new hair growth! I’m still shocked but when I touch it I can feel the hair and can see it in the mirror. A few others have noticed and are asking me about my “secret”</li>
    <li> Tried them all, dasgro has been the only product able to produce hair growth. The hair that is growing out is not falling back out and appears to be permanent! It has exceeded my expectations in every way.</li>
    <li> Tried a different product and got a bunch of side effects so I switched to dasgro hair formula and found the product to be highly effective for my alopecia, new hair in 30 days and no side effects, nadda, zip, zero! I highly recommend this product to others dealing with hair loss who want a natural product that truly makes a difference.</li>
    <li> After years of slowly going bald I started using dasgro hair formula based on a recommendation from a friend. It was not an overnight process but it’s been 6 months now and I have about 70 percent of my hair back. I still can’t believe how well these have worked for me but at the same time I am so glad to have found a product that really works.</li>
    <li> Stopped my hair from shedding! I was getting very desperate for a solution to my thinning hair and found the dasgro hair vitamins were the answer I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Not workin too good after 5 months. Ive been taking more than the two pill dosage recently. Is this bad? No bad side effects...</li>
    <li> I was balding so badly that I considered getting a wig. I decided to try this product and in 4 months have new hair growth all over the scalp and it’s growing out too! This product saved me from having to wear embarrassing wigs.</li>
    <li> I gave a three stars rating because I am just starting to use the product, but will rate higher if it starts to make a difference.  Also, three stars because everything about it appears to be plausible. This is my first time to try such a product. I have done extensive research and I feel this has more possibilities since it is all natural, but even then you have to be cautious about what you put inside your body. I like the fact that they use natural ingredients to block DHT. How effective is it, is another questions. Just started to take as recommended, two tablets a day. I will truly update with any changes and progress in hair growth. Once I complete my first bottle, I will let you know of any developments.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an effective and working way to reduce my hair loss for a long time…fortunately I got this free sample through my friend&#x27;s recommendation, I was so glad! Nowadays, I got no problems with my hair anymore, the opposite is happening, they look really healthy!</li>
    <li> Felt a difference immediately and was convinced it works when my family started to notice 2 weeks into using this product. This product is very safe, had it approved by my doctor and had no issues. Will be ordering more as soon as the first bottle is done.</li>
    <li> After dozens of failed attempts at stopping my hair loss I finally found a solution! This product is the real deal and the BEST hair growth product I have ever used. It stopped my hair loss completely and it didn’t take a year or two to work either. That being said, it wasn’t an overnight process and I did use it for 3 months but by the third month I had new hair growth all around my scalp and none in any unwanted areas like the face or body. I urge others to use this product! It’s the best one out there by a long shot.</li>
    <li> You can really feel the differnce in your hair its texture is smoother and fuller. The growth of your hair is at a faster rate too. I&#x27;ve been suffering with alopecia and this helped me immensely in my treatment. I would recommend this product and it works great as it was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;* I got this as a free sample to review it honestly</li>
    <li> My hair is fuller and thicker and I have only been using this product 2 weeks. No side effects and I feel great. Based on my early results I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I needed a natural and safe alternative to many of the mainstream products for hair loss. I eventually found DasGro Hair Formula and was intrigued by the natural approach so I decided I should try it. I took 2 tablets a day for 3 months and there is no doubting that my hair has improved, not just a little but a lot! Everyone that knows me has started to make comments about how much fuller and thicker it is and many are wondering what my “secret” is. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> My partner and I both use this and have seen AMAZING results. It’s not every day you come across a product that delivers such great results and we are just happy it has proven effective for us. It’s part of our daily routine now and we are both glad to have found this product for our hair.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. It got my hair loss under control and has helped me grow fuller, stronger, longer and healthier hair. I will be getting more as soon as this supply runs out.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST natural hair growth product out there! Both my husband and I have had success with hair regrowth in less than 2 months with zero side effects. Both of us have seen a large reduction in daily hair loss. His hairline has improved tremendously while my hair has become THICKER and FULLER. It’s also much longer and overall healthier (vibrant and soft).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We take our tablets in the morning with our breakfast. They are not large but not super tiny (Average size), still there is no issue swallowing these and there is no aftertaste to worry about. Both my husband and I noticed results in the first 7 days of using this product, however, the hair growth took a little longer which is understandable. We’ve tried other products before using this one with little to no results. This has blown those products away and has truly impressed us in every aspect. You will not believe how great this product is until you try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a natural hair growth solution then I strongly recommend getting this. It the best one we’ve ever used!!</li>
    <li> I was in need of a safe and effective hair growth treatment and stumbled on this product. After a few weeks of use I began to notice my hair growth increased while my hair loss decreased significantly. I can’t speak to the long term results because I just recently started using it but the early results speak for themselves!</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to stumble on this product and order it. I have noticed within a few days my hair became stronger and wasn’t falling out. Now that I have used it for a few weeks I only have good things to say. My hair is looking thicker and the texture is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a great natural hair growth product that truly works!</li>
    <li> I had formed some obvious widow’s peak around my hairline that were embarrassing to me. I began the dasgro hair formula vitamins in hopes to stop the receding hairline from getting worse. Not only did my hairline stop receding but after a few months it grew back and is no longer that bad! I couldn’t be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> I just needed something to help stop my hair from shedding excessively, I got that. What I didn’t expect was to get actual fuller and faster hair growth. This product has really done amazing things for my hair. My hair must be loving the nutrients because this product works!!</li>
    <li> After only one month my hair is so much thicker than before. I love the texture and fullness. I was getting depressed about my hair was getting back now have hope that it can get better. I just ordered 3 more bottles and will use it as long as it keeps helping.</li>
    <li> I am only on my second bottle of DasGro Hair Formula and I have to say it&#x27;s made quite a difference in the way my hair looks and feels.  Prior sparse spots are slowly filling in and it does feel thicker.  My boyfriend says when he puts his hand on top of my head it feels like there is more hair.  When I style my hair it looks so much better than it did before. This is the first winter where my hair actually looks as good as it does in the summer.  (A bit of humidity always helps to volumize my hair).  I have tried Viviscal for a few years (and many other brands) and it couldn&#x27;t match what DasGro has done in less than two months!  I will continue to use this product for atleast another 6 months,  unless something better comes along.</li>
    <li> I really needed this and it has helped me tremendously. My hair has virtually stopped falling out and yesterday I started to see new peach fuzz growth on a bald spot I’ve had for many years. I love it and I hope it continues to work as well as it has. Even if I can get a bit of my hair back I’ll be a happy customer, so far so good.</li>
    <li> Just came off another brand to try this due to side effects. I found dasgro hair vitmains proved to be more effective and caused zero side effects. My hair texture, length and softness have all improved and I felt these working in just a few days. I really believe this is a great product and highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I was experiencing a ton of daily hair loss and was worried about going bald! I found dasgro and on my first month I began seeing improvements. I noticed new hair growth on week 5 and it hasn’t stopped since then. This product is definitely worth a try but should be given time past the first 30 days since it wasn’t until my second month that I started to experience the hair growth.</li>
    <li> The product is recommended to be used for 90 days but I’m already seeing results in less than a month! I have very thin hair and this is giving it the thickness I was hoping for. My experience has been fantastic and no side effects!</li>
    <li> This type vitamin I will finish the bottle because of the non after taste!</li>
    <li> I have scarring alopecia and found this product has helped reverse some of the damage over the past few months. It’s not perfect but the difference is noticeable and makes me happy to know that I can still do something about it. If you have alopecia, or balding or thinning then this product is a must have and I would recommend it without hesitation.</li>
    <li> 5 weeks in and I&#x27;m noticing thicker hair in the crown area. Still waiting for some hairline restoration. Being patient and will write another review after 90 days</li>
    <li> I have been using dasgro for just about 30 days and yesterday I looked in the mirror and noticed some new hair growth on my scalp! Wow, I wasn’t expecting it… I thought maybe it would take longer to see those types of results… anyways, very HAPPY!</li>
    <li> Great nutrition in a bottle</li>
    <li> Reduced my hair loss by about 80% in one month, no side effects. I’ll be ordering more.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is my second review, and this has done a good job so far.  I see lots of new dark baby hairs growing on my bald spots. Just bought my second. I will give my next review in a month.</li>
    <li> Do not be fooled by more expensive treatments, this is much better and works. This product has done wonders for my hair and has not only stopped my hair loss but have helped regrow hair in dormant areas all over my scalp. I love it!!</li>
    <li> My hair thickened up quite nicely after one month of using this product. I have tried different things but have to say this works best for me. I’m very happy with this product and plan to get more. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have (should say had) a bald patch on the top area of my scalp that has slowly been filling in after I started using DasGro Hair Formula. This product has exceeded my expectations and has caused no side effects in the process. If you’re balding or thinning this is the best solution out there!</li>
    <li> Over the years my hairline has receded and it’s made me look far older than I should. I was a bit down on myself and after some research I decided to use this product to see if it might help. To my utter surprise my hairline started to restore. No it did not happen in 3 days but the difference was measurable from week to week, now it’s nearly completely restored!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS! I have new hair growth on my scalp and I’m not just talking little peach fuzz growth or anything, actual strands that are starting to grow longer! Incredible results!! This product is the real deal and truly works!</li>
    <li> Super happy with this awesome product. My hair is THICK and softer to the touch. The shine and texture are incredible. A must have for anyone looking for healthier hair.</li>
    <li> I have alopecia and was told that most of the time this is untreatable and that the hair loss is permanent. Well, I believed that for a long time but after trying this product I did start getting actual new hair growth… at first I thought I was imagining it but as I kept using it I noticed more and more hair growth on my scalp. This continued on for months and is still happening! The hair is there and others are noticing it!</li>
    <li> It has been years since my hair has been this thick and full. I LOVE this product and wish I had found it sooner. Try it for yourself but be patient because it took me a few weeks before the results really kicked in but when they did it was amazing!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair growth product I have ever used!! I took 2 tablets a day for a few weeks and couldn’t believe how quickly my hair started to grow. My hair normally stops growing after a certain point and this is the first time I’ve seen it go past that.</li>
    <li> 2 months and the bald spot at the top of my head is filling in quickly. My confidence is back and I got rid of my hat that I’ve been wearing for almost 3 years. I am a customer for life!</li>
    <li> been measuring progress every few days and after 2 weeks can already see that the product is working. I plan on doing the full 3 months and will update this review once I am done BUT based on these early signs it has already been worth it.</li>
    <li> There are so many products that it’s hard to know which ones are worth it. The reason I went with dasgro hair formula is because I like the combination of natural ingredients. I also liked that there were only 2 pills to take instead of 3 or 4 and unlike so many others products out there the ingredients are in substantial amounts to produce results. Sure enough, a few weeks into using the product and my hair loss has already reduced by about 80% and noticing my hair is growing stronger and thicker. Great product and highly recommend it over the other stuff on here.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural hair growth solution I have ever used. I came to try dasgro after using many other big brand products, most were expensive and did nothing but give me rashes and side effects. With dasgro I had real results and real hair growth that happened in less than 30 days of using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Disclaimer: I did get this product for FREE in an exchange to leave feedback here. The above is my honest experience with this product.</li>
    <li> In less than 30 days I noticed results. My hair is looking amazing and healthy! I would strongly recommend DasGro Hair Formula for anyone with hair loss.</li>
    <li> I’ve been diagnosed with alopecia. Doctors and friends told me that it’s not something that is easily fixable so I was a bit surprised when I started noticing hair growth on my scalp after 2 months of using dasgro. I had nearly given up hope and was just going to try this product to see if it would do anything but now I’m hopeful that with long term use I can have my hair back. The progress so far has been very encouraging and I would strongly recommend this product to others who are going through hair loss.</li>
    <li> After a plethora of products that promised the world but didn’t do much I was happy to finally find this product which has truly helped me with my hair loss. I have stopped losing hair and in the last 30 days have started to show new hair growth on the top of my scalp. I’ve tried so many things but this product has really given me hope and it’s actually working!</li>
    <li> I take my order I hope work good for my hair thanks</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks I noticed hair growth around my hairline. It’s only a bit of new hair but it’s also only been a few weeks so I am very hopeful this continues with longer use. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I am a 30 year old afrcan american male and was experiencing a receding hairline but tanks to dasgro my hairline is completly filled in I am just blown away with the 90 day treatment I have my life back nonthing like a great tape line I can&#x27;t stress enoug this is the best product on the market so I encourage potential buyers to buy this product and its all natural!!! I started seing rusults in 10 days scalp was. itching like crazy then new hairs appeared and just kept getting better!!!.I&#x27;m in love with my new hairline so hear I go new haircuts and styles I think I ll get the mowhawk first lol!!</li>
    <li> This product has exceeded my expectations! I’ve been using it for 2 months and have noticed new hair growth recently. But before that I noticed that my hair was getting stronger and wasn’t falling out.</li>
    <li> Found it helps with stopping hair loss and growing hair. Didn’t take long either, saw results in the first month. Very impressed with this product, worth every penny! I will suggest this product to my friends that are experiencing hair loss too, Thanks</li>
    <li> This has helped me reduce my hair loss. I also noticed more hair growth at the temples. Based on my use with this product I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I was able to see progress in my hair in just 7 days. I’m very impressed with this product and will use it for 3 months.</li>
    <li> Hair is thickening up nicely, thin areas are less apparent and it’s growing faster than ever. Based on my use I have to conclude that this product is working, no side effects to report. I definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I am 63 and noticed I was losing a LOT of hair when I showered. I was really afraid I&#x27;d start going bald; I couldn&#x27;t understand why there weren&#x27;t any bald spots yet, there was so much hair loss! I researched the web and found many products for thinning hair, but DasGro had more good reviews and they seemed like a reputable company, so I went with them. I am in the middle of my third bottle, and I love this stuff! There are literally no more than two to three hairs at the drain after my showers now. My hair has more bulk to it, more of a silky feel, and people have begun to notice the change. I dye my hair about every 6 - 8 weeks and use a straight iron on it, so it does get abused. It looks and feels much healthier and thicker than it did before I started this. I&#x27;ll just add, I noticed the most significant improvement towards the end of the second bottle, so if you don&#x27;t see immediate improvement, stick with it! I really helps a whole lot.</li>
    <li> Great so far, almost no noticeable hair loss after 2 months use and hair is starting to grow in some of my problem areas… very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> I’m a skeptic by nature but after using this I have to say it has made a tremendous difference. My hair isn’t shedding anymore, normally it’s everywhere but not anymore.</li>
    <li> The natural ingredients in this product are fantastic and help with a lot more than just hair loss. That said, my hair has been responding well! It has grown and looks fuller. My co-workers have noticed the difference, getting tons of compliments!</li>
    <li> I have been noticing new peach fuzz growth and I’m still on my first bottle. Hair loss is also less noticeable. I used to find it everywhere, sink, pillow, shower… now it’s barely there. This product really works and I urge others with hair loss to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Been taking this product for six months no diffrence</li>
    <li> This product reduced my hair fall by about 90 percent and my hair started to regrow after 5 weeks of daily use. I also noticed improvements in my nails and skin and have had zero side effects. Overall I’m pleased and hope to see continued progress.</li>
    <li> I started to use this to help with my dry and brittle hair and it has proved to be extremely effective in helping in both aspects. I can tell my hair is fuller and it looks revitalized. These tablets have worked better than any shampoo or cream I have used in the past and unlike a shampoo or cream it is far less messy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on month two of this product and so far so good. I&#x27;ve read everyone else&#x27;s reviews and mine is pretty similar. Within couple weeks noticed less fall out. In one month no fall out. Month two started seeing some hair growth. Hair grows much faster and is overall healthier. Recommend</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who is thinning or balding. This made my hair thicker, fuller, and more beautiful. It has exceeded my expectations and I love the natural ingredients, no side effects! Do not pass up on this one!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! It restored my hairline in 2 months. I look about 10 years younger and feel 10 times more confident. It’s not an overnight solution and starts off slow then really kicks in the longer you use it. This product rocks and is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My son is having a wedding soon and we&#x27;re going to take a family photos but im starting to get a bit self conscious about my hair loss.  I told my son about this and he recommended me this product since i was so desperate I automatically agreed.  Fast forward 2 months a week before the wedding my hair is thicker and the growth is. Im oh so very happy because of this product. I would recommend this product to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> My hair has really never been a problem with me till a year ago. Back then I had great hair and my kids and family always complimented my hair. But then my hair started to shed and not grow back I was extremely worried and started to become really insecure. I knew that this was not me and I had to fix this problem. I looked up many sites and I eventually found this product and started using it right away. I felt and saw a difference very quickly, probably by second week I could see a difference in the mirror and new hair growth started shortly after. I am a very happy customer and this product has exceeded my expectations by a mile.</li>
    <li> After a recent tragedy I started to lose hair from the stress and depression.. I thought I would lose all my hair and was scared. I did some research and learned about this product so I decided to use it. Well, after 30 days I was shocked at how quickly it managed to reverse the damage. It’s nice to see that I can recover from this mess and that there are products like this one that really do work.</li>
    <li> Hair is growing fast, the texture and softness is great and no side effects, whatsoever. I’ve tried other products in the past but this one works the best and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hi have been a loyal Dasgrow customer and they have been very supportive and accommodating, answered all my questions and concerns. Five months ago before using dasgrow I&#x27;ve been miserable pondering on what i should do about my hair. It&#x27;s been many years since  I have had a full head of hair then when this product came into my life I have grown and regained so much of the hair I have lost. This company is extremely kind to me and have always treated me well and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> It really grows your hair!!! I have used it for a few months and the difference from day 1 to now is incredible and I am constantly being asked what I have done to get my hair looking the way it is. I can’t see myself using anything else now that I have discovered dasgro!</li>
    <li> This product has made me proud of my hair again. I used to have thin wispy looking hair and this product gave it volume and thickness like never before. It’s amazing and has exceeded my expectations in every way.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair growth product I’ve ever used. I seriously wasn’t expecting to see my hair grow back but dasgro was able to restore my faith. I look forward to the continued progress and plan to use the for at least 6 months.</li>
    <li> I’ve been diagnosed with alopecia and was told that there was little I could do. Luckily I did not let that stop me from trying and found this product proved to be extremely effective. The difference in my hair is noticeable even to my hairdresser and family members. If you’re balding or suffering from alopecia this may be the answer for you too, give it a try.</li>
    <li> I constantly worry about my hair loss, everytime I shower or touch my hair I look at my hands and see how much hair I&#x27;ve lost. I stopped using hair products, and started buying specific Shampoos and Conditioners, but nothing seemed to work! My dermatologist even tried to prescribe me  expensive pills (insurance wont cover it) that will help hair loss with active ingredient with possible side effects that I had to keep taking. I started looking for natural remedies for hair loss and stumbled acrross this product online and gave it a try, as soon as it came in I started taking it, and within two weeks I started seeing results, much less hair loss when showering, when I style my hair, in my pillow etc.. I am now on my third bottle and very amazed with results! I had a hair cut about a week ago and my stylist noticed that is less noticeable, I told him about this product because he also has thinning problems, he was very excited and said he was going to give it a try! I still look at my hads everytime I touch my hair, but now is very rare to see hair in my hands and its a good feeling :)</li>
    <li> Due to reviews I had high hopes. Unfortunately didn&#x27;t work at all for me. At end of bottle I&#x27;m still having literal gobs of hair fall out ... will add Spirulina to my daily intake, as well as double up on the wheatgrass. Glad so many others have been helped.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff… reduced my hair loss and hair is growing again… starting my second bottle this week and feeling hopeful for the first time in a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product and great company, any questions I had they answered quickly. I have been seeing less hairfall ever since I started and plan to use it long term.</li>
    <li> So far I have seen my hair get thicker and fuller while the texture has also improved. It’s still early on for me so I can’t speak for long term results but I am already seeing improvement and that’s good.</li>
    <li> Early to tell if there are specific results . Will be tracking this at the 30 day point. I&#x27;ve noticed improved texture of hair and my skin also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still taking dasgro I&#x27;m not really sure if I&#x27;m completely satisfied yet I still have a ways to go before I can see the progress. I&#x27;m still currently on my 1st month</li>
    <li> Who know a natural product could be this effective! I’m still in shock at how much new hair growth I have experienced while on dasgro. I’m forever grateful to have found such an amazing product that produces such amazing results. Do not pass it u p and try it for yourself, you won’t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it says, my hair is no longer falling out (very happy) and my hair is growing longer, stronger and fuller. It really adds volume and made my hair healthier than I can ever remember.</li>
    <li> It works! Saw results in about a month but plan to take it for much longer.. just as long as it keeps working. My friend swears by them and I am starting to see why... easy to take, you just do 1 tablet in the morning with some food and one in the afternoon with some food. I was doing a scalp cream before but this is much preferred and is actually working better than expected.</li>
    <li> MY HAIR IS THICKER! THANK YOU. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> I didn’t think I would find something that was effective and that didn’t cause side effects but this product really delivers and has been very gentle on my system. I would highly recommend it for those with hair loss as well as for those who want nicer, longer and healthier hair.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical because I had tried so many other hair products that wasnt successful.&lt;br /&gt;But with hair product Its amazing. I&#x27;m loving each and every minute of this product. I went from slick rick (completely bald ) to baby fuzz. I will continue to take this product. If you have any doubt try this product, I have no regrets at all.</li>
    <li> I started taking this product 6 weeks ago and have some new hair growth happening. The texture and shine of my hair is also quite a bit better. I have not experienced any side effects which is very important to me. I will update my review once I’m done all 3 bottles.</li>
    <li> I love it! It works and helps my hair grow while maintaining the shine, texture and thickness. I’ve never seen a product this effective. I have stopped using other products and use only this exclusively. I strongly recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle, I see new growth, but my hair is still falling out, i&#x27;ll finish this bottle and try a 4th hopefully it will work if not i&#x27;ll be very disappointed I&#x27;ve tried so many products nothing helps</li>
    <li> I was happy to see some benefits in one week of using DasGro. I can tell my hair is longer and healthier… the improved texture and softness is really noticeable. This is the product I’ve been searching for my whole life!</li>
    <li> Very happy to see that the hair texture, length and thickness of my hair have all improved since starting on dasgro. There have been zero side effects and the tablets are easy to take. I do one in the morning with my bagel and coffee and one in the afternoon with whatever I am having for lunch. No complaints so far.</li>
    <li> I was a bit taken back by this product simply because I had my doubts but what can I say, it has given me some amazing results. I haven’t seen my hair this thick in as long as I can remember. It’s shedding considerably less and there have been no side effects. Fantastic product and well worth the price!</li>
    <li> My hair has been shedding for years and it has gotten to point of balding. I tried this product to try and counter the hair loss and have so far seen a significant reduction in hairfall. Very hopeful that this will continue. Based on my early experience this seems like a very good formula and I will be ordering more as soon as I am done with my supply.</li>
    <li> I love it… ever since I started using this product my hair has stopped shedding, it’s softer and has more shine. I often worry about potential side effects and I’m happy to say I have no problems using this product. I’ll try to update my review in a few months.</li>
    <li> This product has drastically reduced my hairfall! I no longer find clumps of hair in the sink or shower drain. My hair is staying on my head where it’s supposed to be! I recommend this product to anyone with hair loss who is concerned and wants a natural product that really works.</li>
    <li> I don’t have hair loss but wanted something that would help my hair grow longer and faster. I used this product and noticed faster hair growth... It normally stops at a certain length and now is growing past that length all the meanwhile the texture and color have improved too. I would say at this point I will  be getting more.</li>
    <li> I have a horrible receding hairline and this product has helped tremendously. There are new hairs growing at the hairline. It looks much fuller now… it’s a huge relief. I feel like I found this product just in time. Don’t let yours progress too far! the further it progresses the harder it will be to fix it so do yourself a favor and try this out, it’s helped me more than I thought it would!</li>
    <li> I’m very happy to say that after several months my hair is in a much better place. It used be thin and whispy and now looks thick and full. The hair growth is wonderful and even my existing hair is looking amazing. Ever since I started using this formula I have been getting daily compliments from co-workers and friends.</li>
    <li> I wasn’t sure if this would do much for my hair but happy to say it has so far lived up to my expectations. I find it helps my thinning hair from falling out and has even made the texture and fullness better.</li>
    <li> I tried the full Das Gro 3-month treatment process (I even went a fourth month just to be certain) and am disappointed to report zero results. I am not one of those people who is quick to assume that reviews are fake but in this instance they absolutely are. This product is simply very well marketed but it is a complete waste of money. If you&#x27;re suffering from hair loss, no matter what stage you are in, you should look into more proven medical procedures. There is no magic pill that will reverse the process; it&#x27;s as simple as that.</li>
    <li> I have been using dasgro for 4months have not seen any results.i dont no where all these great reviews came from.if this product was that good this would be on every news station.to me this is a scam!</li>
    <li> Wondering if any of these reviews are real. Used for 3 months so far and have not seen anything noticeably different.</li>
    <li> 5 days into the formula and my thinning hair has already started to thicken up. I was not expecting the quick results! it’s very good!</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering these hair formula.  Being a nurse, I like it that it is all natural and that is very important for someone my age. I am 71 years old and the front of my scalp was just about bald. I tried everything and was just about ready to call it quits. The I came upon these review about DasGro hair formula and though I would try them, As one viewer said, what did I have to lose but more hair. Let me tell you,  God answer my prayer because I start seeing my bald spot fill in and eventual it was covered with thin hair... Well I been taking them every since. It made  a believer out of me that whatever you ask God he will send his  &amp;#34;Angels&amp;#34; to help you.  Here my &amp;#34;Angels&amp;#34; was the people who review I read. I always buy the 3 bottles to never run out. I use to be embarrass to wear my own hair and wore a wig most of the time which I hated ,but thanks to reading all these reviews my wig is gone . It may not work this way for everyone but its worth a try.</li>
    <li> On my first bottle. Noticed some tingling and iching. This is good, lets me know some type of circulation is going on as this was not happening at first.  The rating stated noticable results after the second bottle.  I will rate it again once I see more results.</li>
    <li> I worry about putting chemicals in my hair that’s why I got dasgro hair vitamins instead, they are natural and don’t cause any breakouts or itchiness. My hair has been growing rapidly ever since using these tablets and I could not be happier with these fantastic results. Do not pass up on this one and try it for yourself!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical but gave the product time and it really turned me into a believer when I started to see my hair growing like never before. I was already impressed with the hair growth but the longer I used it the more benefit it seemed to provide. I noticed better texture, better shine, better fullness, thickness and the thin areas of my scalp became… well… less thin. My hair looks stunning after using this product a couple months. You just wouldn’t think such an affordable product can be so effective but it really has been for me. I have spent so much more on other so called treatments and this has done more for me than all the others put together. Thank you dasgro!!</li>
    <li> Everybody could tell that my hair is growing much faster and it is much thicker. I am so thankful that my wife bought the formula for me.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble growing out my hair. Everything I tried was pointless, then I read about DasGro and figured I would try it. My hair started to grow and has been growing faster than ever! This is product is the real deal; I’m a customer for life!</li>
    <li> My hair has been growing longer and stronger thanks to dasgro. I love this product and recommend it to anyone. It doesn’t just work for hair loss, it also makes your existing hair healthier. I wasn’t balding or thinning when I took this but it has helped make my hair look great!</li>
    <li> I needed a natural product that would help me grow out my hair. I was recommended dasgro by my hairstylist and I haven’t looked back since. My hair has grown a few extra inches since I started using it and it looks fabulous. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I was a tad bit skeptical of natural products producing real results. I was wrong! This stuff is absolutely amazing and has produced some of the best results of any product I have ever used! You feel it working and the hair growth is awesome and no side effects. Trust me, try it for yourself and see how well it works.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for 3 months, have seen new growth  around edges and shedding has stopped.  Will continue to use daily</li>
    <li> I love it, been using it for 2 months now and my hair looks great. I would recommend to others who are looking for a natural way to stop hair loss and regrow hair.</li>
    <li> It’s been 3 months and I have noticed a lot of new hair growth on my scalp and hairline. I was skeptical at first but gave the product a fair try and I’m not regretting it. I take it every morning with my breakfast and like the idea of vitamins instead of creams and oils on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I didn’t think they would work but was pleasantly surprised when I noticed some new hair growth around the hairline and the top of my head. It turned me into a believer and has given me some much needed hope.</li>
    <li> I’m thrilled! I have been on the product for 2 months and already my there is new hair growth on my scalp while my thinned out areas are considerably thicker. I’m starting to get a bunch of compliments and have never felt better!</li>
    <li> I have used this product less than a month and I notice a different.  My hair is not breaking as much,  I would recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing hair damage due to breakage.</li>
    <li> I have a ton of friends who are bald, so i recommended this to them, i&#x27;ve seen reviews online about it and its definetly no scam. My close friend has actually tried this and I&#x27;ve noticed he has grown a full head of hair now, he can have his ponytail again like he did when he was younger if he wanted to. Instead of being bald he now has to get a haircut!</li>
    <li> It’s been 90 days and I just ordered my next 3 months. There is no doubt in my mind that this has helped with my hair loss. My hair has become thicker and the texture has improved. It also makes my hair grow faster and longer.</li>
    <li> I have to be extra careful with the products I use due to health reasons. I take dasgro and find it helps my hair stay healthy and keeps it from falling out. I don’t get any side effects from it and even had my doctor look at the ingredients which he was convinced were safe for me.</li>
    <li> Tried a big name product, not sure if I can name it here so won’t, and unfortunately it didn’t work. Tried this next and found it far more effective. Not only did I see progress in hair regrowth but I didn’t get any side effects. The previous product gave me itchy scalp and was much harder to use but this one was easy. Take 1 tablet twice daily, it just became a part of my routine and soon after starting I started to see a difference.  I would highly recommend this to others considering a natural route and those who want a product that won’t severe side effects.</li>
    <li> I recently stumbled on this product and decided to give it a shot and I can honestly say it was a great decision. My hair grew faster, thicker and had better texture after several weeks of using this. I’m not balding or anything so can’t speak to how well it works for that but my hair has become much thicker which gives it that full look and feel. Overall this has provided some much needed improvement to my hair and I would recommend it to others without any hesitation.</li>
    <li> I have been on it for 5 months and have noticed a tremendous amount of new hair growth since starting. I would say my first measurable hair growth occurred towards the beginning of my second bottle but I did notice gradual progress even during my first month. The ingredients are amazing and they really help your hair grow!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a product that had real proven ingredients and didn’t cause a bunch of nasty side effects. Fortunately I was able to find that in DasGro Hair Formula. I did plenty of research on the ingredients and made sure they had some real science behind them. I found that the formula does contain many of the most important ingredients for hair growth and was able to verify that with a few others. As far as results, it has been amazing! My hair loss is manageable again and I have even noticed some hair growth around my hairline and top of my head.</li>
    <li> This stuff has really impressed me. I have tried so many products and most of them didn’t work but with this product I realized I started to see results very quickly. I was a little taken back because I thought this would be another bust but when my hair started to grow I knew it was working. This is a must try for anyone dealing with hair loss.</li>
    <li> I observed less hairfall in my first week and new hair growth towards the third week. I just started my second bottle and I’m still seeing progress. This is truly one of the best hair growth products out there and it has made a believer out of me.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from hair loss for nearly a decade. It has been one long depressing journey and during this time I wondered if I would ever find anything that would help. I tried some treatments but they had little effect and as soon as I stopped the hair worsened. I started using dasgro about 4 months ago and at first I didn’t think much of it that is until my hair started to grow back! It was such a huge relief and it has been a life changer for me.</li>
    <li> Great!!.. I was skeptical about this but it did grow my hair a little...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m half way through my second bottle and I don&#x27;t see any results, my hair has only gotten worse looking if anything.</li>
    <li> So I took these pills along with the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner for hair loss, I started both together. First, within a week, my nails started getting stronger and they were growing much faster (I have paper thin nails) 2 weeks later my hair loss decreased significantly. Like really, i was shocked! I thought it was because of the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;m using. I ran out of these pills and didn&#x27;t purchase again thinking I won&#x27;t need them. Well the past week my hair loss has gone back to what it was again. I&#x27;m loosing a lot of hair again so that means it was these pills that helped reduce the hair loss and not the shampoo. I just repurchased, I will use it again for a couple of months and will update you guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw I&#x27;ve haid hair loss issues since I hit puberty, there is nothing wrong with me. It&#x27;s hereditary. Nothing has worked. If these pills are the reason my hair loss reduced so much then whoever is suffering from hair loss should definitely give it a try. I will update this review again in a month or two.</li>
    <li> Great product and has made my hair thicker. Hair is also growing much faster since I’ve started.</li>
    <li> I was a tad bit skeptical but after several months of using this product swore I would never go back to not using it. My hair looks like it did 10 years ago, the thickness, shine and softness is unbelievable. This is the real deal and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with hair loss!</li>
    <li> Made my thin hair much thicker! I would highly recommend dasgro hair formula to anyone who wants a natural product that works. I personally can’t see myself without it and have added it to my daily routine. This product causes no side effects or unwanted hair growth in other areas.</li>
    <li> Hair loss has lessened and hair is healthier. The product recommends 3 months so I will finish that but so far I like what it’s doing for me.</li>
    <li> Tried a bunch of things and nothing worked. Tried dasgro next and was surprised to see that my hair started to show progress right away. Everything from texture, softness, length, fullness to actual hair growth. I have stopped taking all other products and plan to use this one for at least 3 months.</li>
    <li> Great product it stopped my hair from falling out and I recently noticed some new hair growth around my scalp. I’m impressed to see such good progress so quickly.</li>
    <li> Reduced hair shedding by 80% in less than a month. Hair is much thicker and texture has improved. No side effects. Overall very pleased with the progress and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> It worked better than expected. I knew it was making a big difference when others started to notice and make comments. I will be getting more as soon as I run out, great product.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks I noticed new hair growth on the hairline and top of my head. It’s still just starting but there is no denying that this hair is new and has not been there before, very happy and look forward to continued hair growth!</li>
    <li> Was delivered on time, just started using it. So cannot tell if it&#x27;s working yet. Looked just as described. Hopefully it works</li>
    <li> I have very long thick...more and more I found a lot in the drain catcher and carpet. After about 2 weeks I saw less and less . I have extremely highlighted dark hair after 2 weeks growth was about 1/2 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be going to see the hairdresser more frequently....on the good side in a year I&#x27;ll have grown a foot of hair!!</li>
    <li> My wife told me my hair didn&#x27;t look as healthy, and the doctor agreed. I contacted DasGro and I was given a free trial and seriously after the 7 days as it said my hair looks so much brighter and healthy. Something i guess i was used to seeing it kinda dull for a while.</li>
    <li> I have been using for over 2wks, and haven&#x27;t seen any new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue and see what happens.</li>
    <li> I have new baby hair growth on my head! No unwanted hair growth anywhere else which I was worried about and no side effects. I’m extremely happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Tried a bunch of products, gave each product 1 month and moved on until something worked. Well… this worked! Great product and does help promote new hair growth.</li>
    <li> Most of the &amp;#34;hair growth&amp;#34; solutions contain bad things that could harm your body. Furthermore, most of the time they don&#x27;t even work! I recieved this as a free sample, and have been using it for about 3 weeks. I have gotten super good results by using this, and I am very satisfied. These pills are all natural, so there arent any bad things going into your body. If you were to keep using this for a while, you will get some really stunning results.</li>
    <li> Currently two months into use of the product - no discernible difference..  Didn&#x27;t really expect it to work - general medical consensus is that there is virtually nothing taken internally that will restore hair growth, with possible exception of prescription drug Propecia - I tried that sometime back and it, too, did  nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s live with it, or go for hair transplants. Sorry to be bearer of bad news.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I thought this was a rip off just like many other products. I still took this supplement and hoped for nothing. The only reason i took it was that I got it for a full discount from the seller. He said I would definitely see some results but I kept being neutral. After a week or so, I couldn&#x27;t hide how excited I was. It really made my hair finally grow and those were the fastest results ever</li>
    <li> I developed spot at the crown of my head due to stress and smoking. I have been using dasgro because it was recommended to me by a friend and 3 weeks in I can see some new baby hairs at the crown!! This stuff is extremely efficient and works faster than any other product I have tried in the past!!</li>
    <li> I was freaking out after I went on vacation and got a really bad burn on my head. Many of the hairs on my head burned off and it was a really deep burn. I was thinking well guess I was loosing hair anyways might as well try something. After one month of using this and infinite growth at the sametime I have much thicker and way more hair than I had before. Im not sure what one worked but hell now I want the bold spot on the back of my head gone now that the front is fine. I will keep using both this and the infinite growth. Im going to leave the same review for infinite grow because I really am not sure what one of the two products worked better be buying more of both.</li>
    <li> I felt and noticed a difference in the first few days. I think this product is great already and can’t wait to see what using it for a few months will do for me. Big plus that the ingredients are natural and that it’s made locally, so many bad products made overseas and glad this isn’t one of those.</li>
    <li> Balding is horrible and I was probably a year or two away from having to shave my head and start wearing hats. I heard about dasgro from someone at work and being skeptical I didn’t think a tablet would really help me but seeing how I didn’t have much to lose (literally)  I decided why not. Fast forward a few months and my hair is growing, new hair, all over the scalp… simply incredible! It’s wasn’t overnight but the progress has been steady… no side effects or signs of reversal either.</li>
    <li> These natural ingredients are exactly what my scalp needed. Ever since I started using this product my hair has been thickening up and appears fuller than ever. I love the increased hair growth and would absolutely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised! It really did stop my hair from falling out and after 8 weeks I started to regrow hairs in all the patchy areas that desperately needed hair. My hair is considerably thicker and the confidence boost is simply incredible. Do not pass up on this great hair growth product it really works!</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive stomach and can’t take many things. I was happy to see that I didn’t get any side effects on this product… I starting to see some new hairs around my hairline, great start!</li>
    <li> Good results in less than 30 days, hair is longer, fuller and stronger (not falling out). No side effects which is a huge plus for me.</li>
    <li> I’m excited to report that after 5 weeks of using this formula I have started to notice new hair growth on my head. I have a big bald patch that has started to fill in and is showing no signs of stopping. My existing hair looks healthier and is no longer shedding.</li>
    <li> This product truly works and I’ve had wonderful results! My hair was in bad shape prior to starting then after using it for less than a month it has improved light years! It’s so much thicker and more luscious, feels softer and looks younger. Do not pass up on this and try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I put my skepticism and tried this product out and wow am I ever glad I did! It’s been 30 days now and my hair is growing faster than it has in years, not just existing hair but new hair around the bald patches on my head. At first I thought I was maybe exaggerating the results but I had a few people confirm that there is indeed new hair growth on my scalp. My spouse can’t believe and actually ordered a bottle too.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly but obviously results will vary depending on the extent of hair loss. Mine was pretty bad and I found it helped restore a bunch of my hair in the 3 months that I used it. Better than anything else I have tried to date… I’m a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I am using it but no effect arise. I will wait and continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It has been 3 months and the amount of new hair on my head is absolutely shocking to me. I still look at it and can’t believe that I was able to grow this much hair in such a short period of time. I came from another popular hair product and this blows that one away.</li>
    <li> I only recently started using this product but have felt the difference already. My hair is definitely softer and the hair shedding not as aggressive. I’ll continue to use this product to see what kind of long term results it produces.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good and I have found it’s already helping me stop much of my daily hair loss. I feel like I see less hair in the sink, show and around the house. I typically shed worse than my cat and now it’s improving so quickly. This product is great and I can’t wait to see what king of long term results I’ll get with it.</li>
    <li> I got serious yeast infection</li>
    <li> My hair has always been rather thin. I tried a few things but all I seemed to get it side effects. I decided to go the natural route and ended up trying dasgro. Long story short it ended up working for me and my hair is twice as thick if not more! It has truly made a difference and did not cause side effects unlike some of the other products out there.</li>
    <li> My hair was in bad shape, thinning and bald in some areas. It was an embarrassing situation and I wanted to do something about it. I started using DasGro Hair Formula based on a recommendation from a co-worker. Low and behold it started to work within just a few days but the hair growth did take some time so don’t expect overnight, which is understandable. That being said, after 3 months my hair looks amazing, it has grown out and filled in quite nicely. I’m not feeling self-conscious, in fact I feel more confident than ever. This is a must have product for those who want a natural product that delivers some serious results.</li>
    <li> So far I’ve had a very positive experience using this product. My hair is certainly growing faster and falling out less. It’s too early to talk about hair growth but I’ll be sure to come back and update my review after a few months.</li>
    <li> I was using a few different hair products and was told to give dasgro a try. At first nothing seemed to happen then around the third week I started to notice tiny new hairs on my scalp while my existing began to thicken up! Very cool, it got me excited about what long term use will do. Glad I learned about this product!</li>
    <li> I gave this product five stars simply because it has worked better than many other products I have tried in the past. I was able to see results in less than 3 weeks and I continue to see results and I’m on my 4th bottle. I wish I started using it years ago, my hair is very healthy now and hair loss is a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> Ok, this product is INCREDIBLE. I have new hair growth all around my scalp, not just little peach fuzz hair, super thick hair that is slowly growing out and showing more each day. Do not pass it up, you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> This was given to me as a free sample to see what results it would have on me. I didn’t know if something like this would work so good and make sure my hair loss was stopped. Finally I’m living a better life with absolutely no hair loss.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! If you need help with your hair loss I suggest trying this product. I found it has helped me quite a bit and barely notice any hair around the house.</li>
    <li> It stopped my hair from falling out and after several weeks I started to notice some new hair growth. This is very exciting and gives me some much needed hope. The early results are very good and I do recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> My hair went from think, wispy and frail to thick, full and growing. I would recommend this to anyone who wants thicker and fuller hair. For a natural product this has exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I’ve been a DasGro customer for quite some time… I actually just finished my 6 months. First the results, they’ve been amazing but don’t expect overnight progress, not saying it can’t happen but it’s not realistic. I assume that results vary by person so that is something to keep in mind. It does take time but if you give it a chance then you will be impressed at how much thicker and healthier your hair will be. In my case I even noticed new hair growth after 3 months that is still growing today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there have been no side effects. It’s a natural product so it’s not going to cause you to grow a third arm or anything crazy. If you have a lot of health issues then it’s still a good idea to check with your doctor, mostly as a precaution. In my case I did not get a single thing that would worry me and in fact have felt fantastic since many of the ingredients help overall health as much as they help with combating hair loss and promoting hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, the customer service of this company is fantastic. They really care about their customers and go above and beyond when something comes up. For example, I had an issue with one of my shipments and contacted them. I had a response the same day and they helped me track it down and resolve the problem in just a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve seen a review of someone post a picture of cracked tablets which I can tell you should not be an issue. I’ve ordered 6 times (1 bottle at a time due to financial restrictions) and not a single one had any problems. It’s important to store the product properly otherwise (especially in summer months) if you leave it out and expose it to the elements then it’s no surprise that something like that may happen. Do not let these few outliers sway you from an otherwise great product because it really does work and is one of the safest products I’ve ever used. I highly recommend it and plan to use it indefinitely!</li>
    <li> My hair is thicker and growing out fast. I also notice less hair loss when showering and brushing my hair. It’s easy to take and I like that I don’t have to apply anything to my scalp. No side effects with this, natural is the only way to go in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and I needed a product that would help thicken it up. I used this product for 4 weeks and the difference in thickness is incredible. I am so impressed that I just ordered 3 more bottles.</li>
    <li> Got this bottle of hair pills from my dad cause he noticed that my hair was getting thin when I last saw him (bad hair runs in the family). He told me to try them out and I didn&#x27;t really want to at first because I hate taking pills specially ones for your hair! After a while I tried them for 4 weeks straight and I noticed good results in my hair on the 18th day. The early results are great and I am starting to see some tiny new hairs growing as I am nearing the end of my first bottle.</li>
    <li> I did not find that this did anything. I used 3 bottles worth to give it an honest try! No difference.</li>
    <li> At a recent family party my sister said that It looked like I was going bald it was very embarrassing. She told me that she could help me and later that night she sent me this product link on Facebook so I ordered it after seeing all the great reviews. So far it is working pretty well. I saw my sister the other day and she says that she noticed a difference in the thickness. Pills are easy to swallow and don&#x27;t taste bad. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I wanted to say that I’ve been using dasgro for about 3 weeks and I have begun noticing some exciting changes such as stronger hair, better texture and fuller hair growth. This is a must have product for anyone with hair loss, it works better than shampoos, creams or oils.</li>
    <li> My hair is thicker, longer and stronger. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to get thicker hair and those with hair loss. I did not get any side effects which is important but not surprised considering it uses only natural ingredients and is made locally.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using dasgro for less than 30 days and have already seen some fantastic results! I used to nearly clog the drain every time I showered and now when I look it’s so much better, so few hairs in the drain and sink, love it!</li>
    <li> I have a massive bald patch at the center of my head. I’ve been on dasgro for 3 months and that same spot is now about 80% filled with hair. I still can’t believe how effective this product has proven to be especially after trying other things with no luck. This one really does work!</li>
    <li> I have alopecia and find this product helped restore my damaged hair follicles. Now my hair is growing again. I’m still in shock but love the results and can’t wait to see what type of results I get after 3 months.</li>
    <li> If you’re like me you have probably tried everything out there… well, do yourself a favor and just stop and get this product. From everything I’ve tried this product works best to stop hair loss, improve thickness and help hair grow again, nothing else compares.</li>
    <li> I’m sensitive to a lot of products and I wanted something safe and effective to help me with my hair loss. I found dasgro and I can say that this product is really worth it. My hair is far healthier, growing stronger and not falling out as much AND no side effects, in fact, I feel great!</li>
    <li> 5 star product! My hair is very thick after one month! I have been getting a ton of compliments from people around me. Some of them think I had hair transplant because I look so different now. I will be getting more.</li>
    <li> My hair is so much healthier thanks to DasGro. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> I had a bald spot on the top of my head and figured I would try this product to see if it would do anything. Within 3 months the bald spot was no longer bald; it’s filled in with hair! It was not an overnight process but the results have been steady and appear to be permanent.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I got it as a free example but that was enough to fascinate me! I will definitely purchase this in the future, my hair looks much thicker and healthier thanks to this product, I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I got the product on time. Satisfied!</li>
    <li> It’s been several months and I’m happy to say that there has been a tremendous improvement in the health and thickness of my hair. The results are tangible and I have piqued the interest of many co-workers due to the awesome progress I’ve been able to achieve. There have been no side effects or any other worries and I find this product easy to take since it’s only 2 tablets a day and you can take them both at the same time.</li>
    <li> My hair is growing FAST! It used to barely grow and I had a lot of trouble getting the length going. I wasn’t sure if this product would help me since it seems more towards people with hair loss but the nutrients are proving very effective and help my hair grow fast.</li>
    <li> Have not seen any improvement but hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> I have been taking DasGro for about three weeks now and have noticed that my hair is shinier, not as dry, and I can already see new hairs growing in the front of my hairline where I had been experiencing some thinning. Over the years I have been on and off different oral contraceptives which I believe may be the reason for my hair thinning and becoming dry. I recently stopped taking my birth control and around the same time I started taking DasGro to help my hair during the transition. I have noticed some shedding recently (nothing alarming) which is a symptom from stopping oral contraceptives but hopefully it will pass as my bodies hormones level out. I have had no side affects from taking this product and plan on ordering more very soon. I&#x27;m extremely happy to see new hair growth and hopefully there will be more to come. Only gave it 4 out of 5 stars, because I would like to see what the long term results are.</li>
    <li> I have alopecia and find this is helping with the damaged areas of my scalp. My existing hair is much thicker and overall my hair just looks healthier. If you’re balding or thinning then this may be very good for you and is definitely worth a try, it has been for me.</li>
    <li> I’ve been on this product for 6 months and have seen a full transformation. I used to have a massive bald spot on the top of my head that has completely filled in and my existing hair is thicker than it has been in 10 years. I can’t recommend  this product enough, this is a must have for those losing their hair!</li>
    <li> New hair growth started on my fifth week and has continued on from there. This product is bringing back my hair and I couldn’t be happier. Absolutely zero side effects and I feel like the natural ingredients are helping with my skin too.</li>
    <li> Wow, this product really works! New hair growth in less than 30 days and the thickness is unreal. I totally love it. No side effects and I’ve been using it for 3 month. I take 2 tablets per day with my breakfast and have had no issues. I’ve even stopped using every other hair supplement because of how effective dasgro has been.</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair is fuller, thicker, longer and the color is better. Overall a great success, the healthier hair makes me more confident. I have been recommending dasgro to a lot of people!</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample throught a promotion and I had taken these on and off for over 2 months now. I have beaten my problems with my hair loss thanks to this product! My hair is growing faster now, it looks natural and it&#x27;s thicker, plus I&#x27;m not losing hair anymore…I&#x27;m stunned that this works so well!</li>
    <li> My hair is no longer shedding like mad; it’s actually down to almost nothing. The thickness and texture is amazing and it’s only been a few weeks. No side effects, just hair growth! Very happy!!</li>
    <li> Ever since I can remember I struggled with hair loss. My mom said it was in my genes but I didn’t stop looking for a cure. I contacted the seller and he agreed to give this to me as a free sample to test it out. I don’t have to look for hair loss prevention methods, because this one worked fast and perfectly.</li>
    <li> I run my hand through my hair a few times a day, just a habit. I have a lot of thinned out areas that are going bald. I was running my hand through my hair today and noticed something odd, some new peach fuzz hair growth on my bald spots. I knew this was new and not something that was there before. The only thing I started doing is I recently started using this product. Nothing else has changed! To be honest I didn’t think this product would work for me and was just doing it to maintain my existing hair but now that my hair is growing back I feel like maybe there is still some hope it will come back fully! Wish me luck!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural dht blocker and this product seemed like it had the right combination of ingredients. As soon as I started to use it I began seeing progress, no joke! It was unreal because nothing else has even remotely been this good and I have tried plenty of other products. I have now been using it for 3 months and just got another 3 months… I know people tend to only voice bad experiences so I wanted to make sure that those considering this product really give it a try because it really does work.</li>
    <li> It really works. My sister got this for me as a gift and I was skeptical that it would do a thing but tried it anyways. After 10 days my hair is growing longer and looks thicker! Love it.</li>
    <li> Turned my pee neon green. I used it for 2 weeks waiting to see if that was just an initial thing but nope pee was still green. Threw them in the trash</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and have seen some crazy good results since using dasgro hair vitamins. I like that it’s all natural and you can tell the ingredients are high quality, there are no odors or bad taste to them. It works better than many other harsher treatments and the results are far more permanent. I will happily order more when my current supply runs out. Thank you so much for such an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m halfway through my second bottle of Dasgro and I&#x27;m definitely seeing results. I have ceased losing hair in the temple area of my scalp and I&#x27;ve actually started to see growth of new hair in that area. I just ordered another bottle , hoping to see more positive results. I&#x27;ll keep you guys posted!</li>
    <li> Have not taken it long enough to give a review on the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;Ask me 30 days from now.  But my item arrived 1 day early.  EXCELLENT.</li>
    <li> Every week I see some progress in the form of hair growth. Not only is my hair growing out but it’s no longer falling out. I used to have some crazy hairfall and it would literally clog up the sink (yea, gross I know). Overall I’m happy with what I’m seeing.</li>
    <li> It’s the best natural hair product I have used. It works and it doesn’t cause side effect and there seems to be a lot of crossover benefit for skin and nails too.</li>
    <li> My hair stopped falling out and has gotten thicker, fuller and stronger. I got 3 more bottles and have been recommending it to everyone I know (hair loss runs in the family). Great product and great results, do not pass it up.</li>
    <li> I’m THRILLED at the progress I have been able to achieve on this product. I have new hair grow all over the scalp and it’s been growing in longer every single week. I haven’t noticed any side effects and the results are amazing. Do not pass up on this, try it out!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I was willing to go to some lengths to keep my hair. After several years of stress at home and work that throttled my voice, my nerves, my fairly healthy weight, and my hair, I felt the last thing I could expect to see again would be my hair.  But within the first week of taking DasGro, I saw new growth at my hairline, and while I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in the amount of hair I lose after washing, there is less in the brush on a daily basis, and I love the way my hair feels now.  I&#x27;m just coming down to the end of the first month, and so far, I&#x27;m a believer.  So easy, so much tidier than nasty onion/honey treatments, and real results. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> My hairline has been receding for quite some time but after 1 month of dasgro I’m noticing new hair growth near the hairline area and on the top of my scalp. This looks very promising and has made even more excited than before. I’ll be ordering more now that I see it’s working for me.</li>
    <li> Every month that I&#x27;ve been using dasgro hair formula has helped reduce my hair loss, improve my existing hair and now I am even seeing some hairs growing out on the thinned out areas of the scalp. I will continue to use it and definitely recommend trying it if you need something effective and safe.</li>
    <li> I’ve tried so many products but this one is the one that has made the biggest difference. I now exclusively use dasgro hair vitamins for my hair. My father noticed the changes and has decided to try it as well!</li>
    <li> My hair is looking healthier after 2 weeks of use!!! I also noticed the texture of my skin has improved as well!!! I am excited to see something happening this early. I will update once I’ve used for a few months.</li>
    <li> I tried probably every product out there. I’m not exaggerating when I say this is the only product that has produced REAL results. I can actually see a tangible difference when looking in the mirror. I have experienced NEW hair growth which has shown no signs of reversal since I noticed it. This product is the real deal and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This helps my hair grow faster. It’s also considerably healthier and when I tug on it I can feel how much stronger it is. If I did that before I would literally pull out a chunk It was not good, but now I’m very happy that it’s staying on my head.</li>
    <li> keeps my hair healthy, now on waiting for it to actually grow!</li>
    <li> On my third week I was looking in the mirror examining my scalp and BOOM, new hairs that I know weren’t there before. I’m OCD and check all the time and they appear to be growing out. The early results are astonishing and I can’t wait to see it grow longer.</li>
    <li> I elated to write that my hair is growing back after 2 months of using dasgro. I was recommended this product by a friend and now can’t think him enough and of course the company that made it. Thank you very much for creating a product that works!</li>
    <li> If you’re suffering from hair loss then try this out. I did and it did wonders for my hair. New hair growth started on week 3 and has continued from there. Every week my hair looks nicer and is filling in nicely.</li>
    <li> I have been on the formula for less than a month and I already see the different in my hair. I plan to order more.</li>
    <li> After being diagnosed with alopecia I sort of lost hope that I would ever have nice hair again. I thought I would be lucky if I kept any of it. That being said, after I started using dasgro hair formula I did see the hair loss stop and a month after that it actually started to grow back. I’m still a bit surprised to see such amazing progress but I’m not complaining. This product is worth it, trust me!</li>
    <li> A free trial of DasPro gave me the advantage to take control of my hair loss, it came remarkably fast with Prime, after several days taking it i haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects so i feel just fine. I&#x27;m excited to have a full head of hair again it will be awesome.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see results in less than 2 weeks. It doesn’t cause side effects or unwanted hair growth anywhere else. I’ll come back and write more once I’ve had a chance to use it longer but the early progress is exciting to see.</li>
    <li> I was running my hand through my hair the other day and couldn’t help but notice new hairs on certain areas! My existing hair is growing out and the texture is fantastic. The results aren’t overnight but if you stick with it you will be amazed at what it can do.</li>
    <li> After my first bottle I can see and feel the difference. I have experienced less hair loss over the past few weeks while my hair feels like it has become thicker. I wasn’t expecting much so I am happy to report these early results. I will continue to use the product for the recommended 3 months.</li>
    <li> Month 1 my hair fall was reduced by 80 percent, month 2 my hair became thicker and the texture was nicer. Month 3 I started to get new hair growth on the thinned out areas on my scalp. I’m still using it and it’s still giving me measurable results, great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> If you’re losing hair then try this out! It stopped my hair from falling out in less than 1 month. I was considering wigs and surgery but now feel hopeful that this won’t have to happen. I pray it continues to provide great results. So far it has been good!</li>
    <li> The natural ingredients are great and have made my hair softer, longer and reduced the hair fall. No side effects with this which is great because I’m typically very sensitive to most products.</li>
    <li> The ingredients in this product are incredible… I researched every single one individually and the company really did their homework and put together the best of the best into a tablet. It didn’t take long to see results either. I think my first results came in at around the first week and continued from there. This product has been a life changer and I feel good knowing that the problem is not getting worse but better!</li>
    <li> If you’re losing your hair then try this! I’ve had awesome results on it. I was able to reduce hairfall by 90% percent and to my astonishment grow new hair in an area that has been bald for like 10 years now. I’m still floored by the results but I’m certainly not complaining. This product is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Theses hair nutrients work! DasGro makes my hair look amazing and helps me grow out the length to where I want it.</li>
    <li> I switched from rogaine to dasgro and have found the results to be much better and my itchy scalp is no longer something I have to worry about. I have some bald spots and can see some areas are now slowly filling in. It’s still early on but this it’s looking good so far!</li>
    <li> The widow peaks on my hairline have slowly but surely been getting less noticeable over the last few weeks. I can tell the hairline is growing back and that to me is simply amazing. My existing hair feels and looks healthier too!</li>
    <li> It stopped my hair loss and helped me get my hair growing again. I have alopecia and the hair follicles became inactive but with this they are starting to repair and grow new hair. I wish I found this product sooner but better late than never.</li>
    <li> I was greatly worried about my baldness. I tried out a lot of products, but nothing got me my hair back.  In about 3 weeks of use, I started noticing that my hair started to show up a little. That was really unbelievable for me. So glad that I got it. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I was offered a free sample as I&#x27;ve been a frequent cusomter to the seller.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I was getting depressed because my hair was starting to lose it&#x27;s life slowly. Then I began getting bald. I needed urgent help because this was a real problem for me. There&#x27;s nothing I hate more than being bald. After using this for a while, I noticed that they have strengthened and started to grow!. I&#x27;m so happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect free sample, thanks to the seller.</li>
    <li> Feels like it changed how my hair feels and looks but didn&#x27;t grow any new hair. I took 4 bottles. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My bald spot has shown new hair growth in less than 30 days. I plan on using it 6 months and can’t believe that it’s working already. I also appreciate that it’s natural and made locally, too many things out there are bad for you but this product is safe and works fast.</li>
    <li> I tried everything under the sun and this product is the single most effective solution I have been able to find. I’ve been on it for 2 months and have had crazy success, new hair growth on my head and none in any unwanted areas like the face, legs or arms. I’m excited and feel hopeful that this product will continue to produce amazing results.</li>
    <li> I’ve had incredible hair regrowth with no side effects! It didn’t happen overnight but it did happen over a few months and now my hair looks beautiful and is staying on my head, where it’s supposed to!</li>
    <li> Nothing.. Took full supply</li>
    <li> I have a bald patch on my hair… doesn’t look good. 3 months of using this wonderful product and it’s all but gone. I still continue to see results even though I have decreased the dosage. During the whole time I’ve used this product I have not experienced any unwanted hair growth or side effects. My only complaint is I wish I knew about it sooner!</li>
    <li> On my third bottle and  ZERO results. Save your money and enjoy life instead of falling for some con that claims it regrows hair.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. It stopped my hair fall, improved hair growth and is making my hair fuller and thicker. I’ve been getting all sorts of compliments everywhere I go. People can’t believe how much my hair has grown out and how much thicker it is now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used DasGro for about 3 weeks now. I&#x27;ve noticed my eyebrows, eyelashes, and a small patch of hair has grown back but my hair is still falling out a lot even when I don&#x27;t wash my hair. I actually have a new bald spot. I&#x27;m still a bit skeptical but I&#x27;m definitely gonna keep using it. I know it&#x27;s still a bit too early. I&#x27;m hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> Absolutely incredible. Dealing with hair loss in your mid twenties is not fun for anyone. I know that it&#x27;s hard to decipher between products that work and products that are considered snake oils. Even with as positive as the reviews are for this product I was infinitely skeptical of the effectiveness of DasGro, but I did appreciate that the maker would respond so frequently to people&#x27;s concerns, generally with words of encouragement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to wait to see the results. Remember that hair is structural protein, and structural protein needs nutrients to grow. Whatever it is about those of us that suffer from hair loss, whether it be some over action of our endocrine system or otherwise, we do not get the nutrients to the hair that they need. I generally have had relatively oily hair, but I decided to cut back on washing to only once a week with shampoo, and just rinse my hair with water everyday in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just finished my third bottle, and the little white hairs I was skeptical about becoming anything other than peach fuzz seem to be starting to get into gear and rebuilding the follicles for the correct cycles of growth. You don&#x27;t have to believe that this is a real review, because I know how defeating it can be to try and try so many products with so few results. But if you are willing to try one last thing, buy the three months worth and if it doesn&#x27;t do the trick, you can atleast say you tried. Remember also, that if this product was abysmal the the rating would most likely reflect this. Good luck, and remember that stress can play a large role in hair growth. Work on reducing stress, and your cortisol levels will likely reduce as well, which help your hair do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Be patient, be happy, don&#x27;t wash your hair as often with shampoo, and be healthy and take some time to destress every so often.</li>
    <li> I just got this product 2 weeks ago and already feeling it working on my scalp. When I run my hand through my hair I can feel that the texture has improved and it&#x27;s evident that my hair loss has reduced too</li>
    <li> Its a very poor performing product i have ever used. Instead of acting to stop the hair growth, it seemed to be increased. worst i have ever seen in the category of hair loss controlling product. I have stopped consuming it now. Horrible experience</li>
    <li> These did an excellent job at reducing my hairfall and helping me reverse years of damage. Now my hair is fuller, thicker and longer. I haven’t felt this confident in a while and it’s nice to get a compliment! It just lets me know it’s really working. I recommend dasgro hair formula for anyone with hair loss issues.</li>
    <li> Years of bleaching my hair when I was younger left my hair thin and damaged as I got older I tried many products but no results but with this product my 5 year battle has come to an end. In the first 2 weeks I noticed the feeling of fuzz on the back of my hair and the front . Now at the end of the month my hair is fuller and looks and feels healthier then ever. I thank the makers of this product for giving me my nice hair back.</li>
    <li> My hair is thicker, longer and the texture has improved. I haven’t noticed any side effects with this product.</li>
    <li> Dasgro has helped rejuvenate my hair and thicken it up! Before using it I was on a one way road to bald town but fortunately for me I found something that works amazingly well for me. I did not experience side effects, in fact I haven’t felt as good as I do in years.</li>
    <li> Great product! I just needed some help with my hair length and this did the trick. I noticed that the hair is also softer and healthier in general. I will be ordering more when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I have been losing hair forever and have tried so many different things out there. I am not getting any younger and thought maybe this was the way it was meant to be. Fortunately for me I gave DasGro a try and within a couple weeks I noticed a change in my hair, nothing that would turn heads but enough to convince me to stick with it. It’s now been a few months and the change in my hair is noticeable. I don’t see the hair falling out like it used to. Friends and family have both made positive comments. I am very happy and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I purchased a three month supply last September. I read the product information and the reviews very carefully and decided to purchase the recommended three months supply. I can honestly say that I saw no improvement and the product did not meet my expectations. I wish I could be more positive, but I felt that I wasted my money on this product. It&#x27;s a shame I didn&#x27;t keep my receipt and cannot track when I purchased this.</li>
    <li> this is my 3rd bottle now still no signs of improvement, don&#x27;t know whether all this hype about the product is true or not</li>
    <li> real good need more lol</li>
    <li> I dont know how will a rate this. I almost finish the third bottle ( one week left as of this posting) and the only thing i notice is that my hair looks healthy and shiny but  i dont see any new hair coming . My hair is still thin and i dont know if i need to order more or try some other products.</li>
    <li> I was losing a handful of hair in the shower everyday. Started taking these twice a day and have been using them 12 days so far. I&#x27;m losing hardly anything now. I pull the hair off the top of the drain every day and all of the lost hair used to cover the drain. Now I can&#x27;t even see it because there is so little. I have to run my fingers over the drain to see and pick up what&#x27;s there. I recommend this product !</li>
    <li> I am very glad I found this product.I was diagnosed with cancer in July and started my chemos in late august..My hair was pretty much all gone by september..I had very little hair like a 4 wk old baby. When I found this product around mid October my hair stopped falling.I am growing a lot of new hair and I still have 1 more chemo to go.. So this product stopped my hair from falling and is making me grow new hair while I am still taking chemos.That is how great it is.So if it worked while I am still taking chemos imagine how wonderful it is going to be once I am final done with them.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I am sceptical when it comes to natural products of any kind so this time it was no different but I still decided to try dasgro since I had nothing to lose but more hair. To my shear astonishment I could see that my hair was showing improvement on the day 10 and by day 20 I could see some hair growing out in an area that has been slowly going bald. I am a believer in this product and very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> So far no results been using it for a month onto 2nd bottle not saying it wont work just it hadn&#x27;t so far</li>
    <li> I decided to try this on a whim and was shocked to find my hair improving so quickly. I am seeing reduced shedding and my hair texture has improved drastically. This is a great product and worth the try!</li>
    <li> My hair sheds rapidly and it’s downright depressing. After starting these vitamins I can see a positive change. Far fewer hairs are falling off my head and the texture is improving. It’s still early but I will update in 1 month.</li>
    <li> My hair is typically frail, thin and breaks off easily. After 30 days on this product I have thicker hair with more texture and it no longer breaks off! A night and day different from where I started.</li>
    <li> WOW this is incredible. my hairline was receding for quite some time… I didn’t want to get that old look and started using dasgro hair vitamins. In a matter of weeks I noticed an improvement and after a month I could visually see that the hairline wasn’t as far back. 2 more months and it has nearly been restored to what it looked it years ago. This product is the real deal folks! I have had no side effects. Give it time to work and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> If you’re balding or thinning then I highly recommend this product. It has helped me regrow my hair over the past 2 months and has caused zero side effects. Other products I have used in the past had some benefit but always ended up causing me issues, however, no such issue with this product.</li>
    <li> I lost all my confidence after my hairline slowly receded into the back of my head. I was self conscious and started wearing a hat to hide it. I started to use this product about 3 months ago and didn’t think too much of it. To be honest I’ve head bad experiences with other stuff and those products all turned out to be ineffective. But as I went about my life I started to take a closer look at my hairline and could see what appeared to me as new hairs. I started paying more attention week after week and sure enough the hair was growing in and thickening! I just finished my third bottle and my hairline is actually not bad! It’s not perfect but it’s improved to the point where I don’t have to wear a hat and feel self conscious. I plan on the taking the product for a full year to see what happens but so far it has exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I didn’t see overnight results but stuck with it for 4 months and now my hairline is filling in and restoring back to what it used to be many years ago. The confidence boost is incredible.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 6 months and it has been awesome. No hair loss, and a ton of new hair growth with absolutely zero side effects. This is by far the best hair growth product I have used which is why I stopped everything else and use this exclusively now.</li>
    <li> I had the undesirable widow’s peak thing going and was desperate for something to help. I began using this product and was blown away at how fast it started to make a visual change in my widow’s peak. Little new hair started to grow near the edges 2 weeks in and continued from there. I finished the full 3 months and I can say that I no longer have your typical widow’s peak. I still take a lower dosage to maintain my results, not taking any risks of reversal. Wish I could give this product 10 stars!</li>
    <li> I take 1 tablet in the morning and 1 in the afternoon, hair growth started on my third bottle but I did start seeing other benefits way before that, just the hair growth does take time so it’s important to be patient. I haven’t noticed any side effects or anything else that would be worrisome. I think this is the best hair growth product out there and needs more attention, would definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good! I wasn’t expecting too much from a hair growth pill but was pleasantly surprised that it has made my hair thicker and healthier. I definitely plan on using it long term!</li>
    <li> To early to know after first month but no noted hair loss</li>
    <li> No complaints, so far the results have met my expectations. I noticed less hair falling and shedding on my first week. It’s still early for hair growth but I’ll do the 3 months and update the review then. Thank you and have a blessed day.</li>
    <li> It’s helping me grow out my hair AND my hair looks much better when using DasGro. I have even stopped using a few of my other products since this is helping me much more than anything else.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair growth product out there. I have tried probably 15 to 20 different things and found this one actually helps! I have a bald patch on the top of my head and ever since I started using this it started to fill in. My confidence is sky high and others are noticing the changes too.</li>
    <li> I’m actually astonished to see results in my first 30 days. My hair loss has ended just a few strands which is normal but other than that nothing. My hair feels nicer and looks healthier, not bad for only 30 days.</li>
    <li> I went from thin to thick hair 6 weeks and still can’t believe how well my hair has reacted to this formula. I absolutely love it and recommend would recommend it to others in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> I got results on my first 30 days and now finishing my third month and the changes are simply incredible. There is nothing else out there that has made my hair grow except for this product. I urge others to give this a try but to also be patient with it if you don’t see results right away. With natural ingredients sometimes it takes time depending on the person, but as mentioned I noticed it very quickly. Good luck to others considering this product!</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic by nature and was always hesitant to try natural products because I figured they would be less effective. I was wrong! This product turned out to be great, it stopped my hair from shedding and I started to see new hair growth all over my scalp shortly after starting. I take 2 tablets a day, 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon and have changed nothing else. Huge plus that I have experienced zero side effects to this day! It’s a very different experience than I’ve had with other treatments and I’m glad I was open minded enough to try it.</li>
    <li> I am African American woman looking for a natural product to help grow my hair.I have alopecia and was at the end of my rope, I saw this and was very intrigued by all the natural ingredients. During my search I&#x27;ve read some articles stating saw palmetto was a key ingredient for hair growth,  so naturally when I read that Dasgro Had It  I gave it a try. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and very pleased with the results thus far.</li>
    <li> After nearly a dozen products I have finally found dasgro hair formula! This product delivers results quickly. My hair shedding has stopped and hair growth is visible! I totally love it!</li>
    <li> I was on the fence about buying this but did so anyway and can’t believe how good this is. I don’t like to hype things up but my scalp has started to sprout new hair on my bald patch! I tried several other things prior to this and this is the only product that has given me any type of hope.  Thank you and god bless you.</li>
    <li> It didn’t kick in right away and so the first month I didn’t see much but after the second month I could tell that there was something happening because of how much thicker my hair looked. The third month was the most impressive and I could see little new hairs in areas that I thought would never grow back hair. Do not get discouraged if it doesn’t start working right away because from my personal experience it works best when used for at least a few months.</li>
    <li> I just start taking the supplement and is working so far !!!</li>
    <li> Noticed new hair growth after 5 weeks of use… very happy so far.</li>
    <li> I tried quite a few different products but I’ve always come back to DasGro as my main hair growth supplement. It works better than the other stuff I’ve been using and doesn’t cause me side effects.</li>
    <li> This work!! I have now used it for 6 months and can’t see myself living without it. I have alopecia and this is the only thing that has ever done anything for me.</li>
    <li> Great natural product that has made a huge difference in how my hair looks and feels. My hair is now healthier than it has been since my high school years. I find it’s easy to digest, I take both tablets with my breakfast.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the possibility of this working but tried it and can’t believe the immediate changes that started to happen. It’s incredible how much different my hair after only a few weeks, in a good way! If you’re losing hair and want an effective product that will stop the hair loss and help with hair regrowth then try this out, it worked for me!</li>
    <li> BEST HAIR GROWTH PRODUCT OUT THERE. BEEN USING IT 6 MONTHS AND HAIR LOOKS AMAZING. NO MORE HAIR SHEDDING AND NO SIDE EFFECTS!</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive stomach and many products cause issues. Fortunately this one has been good and has caused no ill effects. I do like how it makes my hair look, much softer and the texture has improved. As far as safe treatments for hair loss this is probably the best one I’ve used.</li>
    <li> My hair has become so thin that my scalp has begun to show… it totally killed my confidence. I went on this product after doing some research and after several months I got my hair back. I want to stress that it was not an overnight process, it did take some time but the wait has been worth it and has given me my hair and my confidence with it.</li>
    <li> This has stopped my hairfall completely! I had a ton of daily hair loss, it was so bad it was clogging the shower drain. Now my hair stays on my scalp where it should be.</li>
    <li> It has been 10 days and I’m starting to see results. The early results are encouraging; it has really slowed down my hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have been taking dasgro every day as instructed and at first it seemed like very little was happening but now that I am on the third bottle I am seeing a major difference from when I started. My hair looks much healthier, has become thicker and has grown out faster than I expected. All these things are exactly what I was hoping for. For anyone considering using the product do not get discouraged if you do not see results right away just stick with it and the results will come. I just ordered 3 more months and I am looking forward to seeing even better results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 29, my thinning hair was becoming very obvious and caused me to become very self conscious about it. I very rarely left home without a cap on.  Assuming there was nothing I could do about this problem I checked out an add for DasGro and read all the reviews which were overwhelmingly positive and ordered some but was cautiously optimistic about the results i would see . After 2  weeks I noticed less and less hair falling out. After  1 month my hair was growing in noticabley thicker and I could feel lots of new hairs growing in the thinning areas on the top of my head. Now half way through my 2nd bottle I am starting to notice a few new hairs growing in near my hair line.  Just half way through the recommended 3 months I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results and they are only getting better. Anybody struggling with hair loss should give DasGro a try.</li>
    <li> 5 stars… this has exceeded my expectations, best product for hair growth!</li>
    <li> I woke yesterday and noticed tiny new hairs on my hairline when doing my daily morning routine. I’m impressed with the early results and will continue to use the product for 3 months as recommended.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for my alopecia and was about to give up. My good friend told me about dasgro and I figured I give it a try. I had no expectations, low and behold a few weeks into the process I start seeing tiny new hair growth around my scalp… incredible. It’s now been 2 months and it’s progressing along and showing no signs of reversal, others have even noticed. This is a great product and a must for anyone with alopecia or that’s balding.</li>
    <li> I saw results in my first week of using DasGro Hair Formula. My hair grows very slowly but already I’m noticing the length has increased. I also have a tiny area that’s thinned out and it appears thicker and less noticeable. I like it because not only does it actually help with my hair but it gives me that extra confidence that my hair is getting the nutrients it needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product free of charge so I could share my experience here. This did not change my views on this product, it truly is great!</li>
    <li> Hair went from super thin to super thick… results started within 7 days. No more losing hair everywhere, used to clog up the shower sink but now it’s barely anything. It’s very easy to take and has not caused me any side effects.</li>
    <li> I was desperate for a solution and luckily found this product just in time. It helped me get rid of a bunch of patchy areas around my scalp in a matter of 2 months. The hair that did grow out is sticking around even though I have reduced the dosage to half. I did not get any side effects while using this and strongly recommend it to anyone struggling with hair loss.</li>
    <li> Dear DasGro,&lt;br /&gt;The rating system is in place to &amp;#34;Rate&amp;#34; your experience with the product. I have read the negative reviews, and decided to try your product, and unfortunately it did not work. I have also noticed that you have poor customer service. This is why I have given you a 1-star rating, and no there is nothing that you really can do to rectify the situation. I took the bottle to my PHC, and he stated that is was basically a multi-vitamin without any type of DHT blocker in it, as well as stating that it contains certain ingredients that can cause severe adverse reactions. I will certainly never recommend this product to anyone. The chemical make up is very dangerous and can do more damage than it is actually worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As, well as berating customers who may have an unknown allergies, is basically just rude. Besides, Even though you have removed my review, I feel the need to let people know about your product. I do plan to post about this more, on my very active blog. And to attain for the fact that most of your reviews are bought, is just bad business.</li>
    <li> I’m stunned by the great results I’ve been able to achieve while taking DasGro Hair Formula. I have tried many products and most did diddly squat but with DasGro I got results very quickly and my hair looks amazing, thank you!!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend to anyone with balding or hair thinning, it has helped me tremendously and has not caused any side effects.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few of these types of products with mixed results but this one has exceeded my expectations. My hair has started to thicken up after only one week and it’s growing fast too! No side effects so far and seeing the progress has restored hope that my hair loss is beatable!! I am very impressed and I high recommend this product to others who need something that really works.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and saw no difference from the results I got in just taking 5000mcg of biotin daily, which only cost $16 per month at my local vitamin store. I don&#x27;t think all of the added ingredients really made any difference, and they just increased the price. Honestly, I&#x27;d say save yourself $25 and go buy some Biotin instead. You&#x27;ll get the same results and have money left over to go buy yourself some better quality shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great results and works fast. I can’t see myself using anything else and will be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> Someone at work told me about DasGro Hair Formula and I decided to try it. Well, long story short it was the best decision I have made. Fast forward 2 months and my hair is doing fantastic. I have so much less hair loss and the hair growth and hair thickening is noticeable and still improving. There are no nasty side effects like with other products and it’s easy to use.</li>
    <li> I only had minor hair loss but use this because it improves the overall health of my hair and I just love how much more my hair grows with it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it has dramatically improved the health of my hair and I’m no longer shedding all over the house. I highly recommend using dasgro simply because I have yet to find a better natural solution for my hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for shedding hair.  I noticed that my hair stop shedding with the first bottle so I ordered a second bottle. Can&#x27;t say that I noticed an increase in length.</li>
    <li> I have a large balding spot on my head and this product has stopped the remaining hair from falling out. A few months later my hair started to grow back on areas that have been bald for quite some time. I’m very excited to see hair growing back! I was worried that nothing would work but this product has really delivered the results I was hoping for and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to others. So if you want a product that really works and will stop your hair loss and help your hair grow back in a natural way then this is a must have.</li>
    <li> Nothing works quite as well as this and trust me when I say I have tried just about everything. This product has stopped my hair from shedding but more importantly my hair is growing back and filling in nicely! The progress appears to be steady and the hairs that have started to grow in are not falling back out. I have not experienced any unwanted hair growth on other parts of the body or any other side effects. This is a wonderful product and it really works… I hope others try it and see for themselves.</li>
    <li> It has been 7 days and I can see improvement in my hair loss. I did not expect it to work this fast, love it!</li>
    <li> It’s been about 10 days and already my hair has stopped shedding. I can tell this product is making a difference and it’s exciting to see some progress. I definitely will recommend dasgro to others!</li>
    <li> My receding hairline stopped receding! In fact, I’ve seen some reversal and new hair started to grow on the edges giving it a fuller look. It’s a huge confidence boost and gives me hope that with a few more months it will look even better.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with alopecia and got this in a desperate attempt to hopefully control some of the damage. Not only did it help do that but it has helped me grow back some of my hair in those areas. I’m still a bit shocked that a little tablet can do so much in such a short period of time.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but my hair has stopped falling out. Can&#x27;t wait till I get new hair!</li>
    <li> I feel blessed to see that my hair is coming back, albeit very slowly but some hair growth is better than none. I prayed and I feel my prayers are being answered. God bless.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and it did not work at all. This is a scam!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was having a serious issue of hair fall and the mid of my head became bald because of that. My friend told me about the free sample the seller is giving to try out the product. I gave it a try and within just about a month, I saw a pleasing change. My hair started to show up a little where I was bald and now they are growing gradually. I just love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller did offer this bottle for free, but my review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> My poor dad had been bald pretty much since i was 6 or 7 years old. and i came across DasPro, while inquiring about it they offered me a free sample so i could help my dad out. I felt very blessed by that, so far my dad has starting growing hair again and boy does he look really handsome, my mom is loving it as well.</li>
    <li> My dad seems to be balding and i decided to get him this to regain his beautiful hair he once had. He was glad to try anything. So he took it as directed and i have noticed him growing hair again. I literary jumped for joy when i saw him!</li>
    <li> I got the 30 day supply and i seem to have burned through the 60 pills in the bottle! I&#x27;m so impressed on how quickly it works and how full of a head of hair i have. I used to have an afro back in high school, which i probably will never have another one but at least i can grow one if it ever comes back in style! I can have whatever haircut i want again!</li>
    <li> Working for me, I had to be patient about this supplement, it was about the half way point of the bottle when I started seeing some changes. I take this supplement 2 times a day, once in the morning and once more at night.</li>
    <li> I was at my salon and overheard a gentleman talking about this product and how great it was for his hair. I searched it up and figured I would try it… to my surprise it produced some really great results and it didn’t take years either. bbefore I was even done my first bottle I noticed my hairfall was drastically reduced and my hair was thickening up quite nicely. I just got my second bottle and I’m looking forward to continued progress!</li>
    <li> I was losing a handful of hair every day no doubt more than the average person!! I was very worried that I would go bald if it didn’t stop so I searched for something to help with this. I found DasGro Hair Formula and started to use it right away and within my first week the hair loss started to slow down and after 3 weeks my hair loss was at normal levels again, just a few hairs here and there but nothing like before. This product works and was able to provide results quicker than expected… I will order more for sure.</li>
    <li> Tried for one month and had minimal results. A few months later I decided to try again and this time do at least a few months and that’s when I started to see some seriously awesome results! Long story short my hair is growing THICK AND STRONG and has stopped falling out. I have a receding hairline and this has helped restore about 80 percent of it in a mere few months. Awesome product, awesome results and thank god I found it.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely stubborn and will not grow past a certain point but after I started to use this product it noticed my hair grew past its plateau point anddd it feels thicker than before.</li>
    <li> My hair started to grow in less than 3 weeks! I have thinning hair and this is exactly the product I needed. I have not experienced any side effects and find this product easy to digest. I wish I had found it sooner… I probably would have lost less hair but better late than ever. This product really works and I have been telling everyone about it!</li>
    <li> I was taking just biotin and decided to try this to see if all the other ingredients would make any difference and boy did it ever. I have a lot of thinning hair and balding areas and this has restored a good chunk of the damage and has actually filled in many of the areas with new hairs. I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it to others with hair loss.</li>
    <li> I was shedding hair like crazy and started to worry about it getting bad enough that I would need concealers or wigs.  I used this product for 3 months with no expectations but was blown away at how it transformed my frailly thin hair into thick luscious hair. It stopped my hair from falling out and the hair growth has been nothing short of a miracle. Do yourself a favor and use it for 3 months… In my opinion 1 month is not enough and my best results came during my 2nd and 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! I have been using it every day and almost done my first  30 days.. right now the hair loss has decreased, hair growth is OK, there seems to be some new hairs popping up… its still early so im not expecting a full head of hair or anything. The verdict is still out if the progress will continue but right now the results speak for themselves and it is working.</li>
    <li> I wanted something safe and effective and decided to use DasGro based on a recommendation. So far it’s been great with no side effects. I’m seeing less hairfall, no more clogging up the drain! And I have even seen that my hair started to thicken up and grow which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product is a complete scam and 99% of the reviews are obviously fake. I&#x27;ve been taking it for 9 months and my hair has only gotten worse. It&#x27;s a shame that they use fake reviews to prey on people&#x27;s insecurities and offer false hope.</li>
    <li> One of my friends recommended this product to me.  This formula has been a life saver!  It helped prevent more hair loss and I’m even starting to regrow some hair!  I was also weary of harmful chemicals in other hair loss products I came across, but thankfully this one is 100% natural.  When my 30 day supply runs out I’ll buy a 90 day one.  I just love this product!</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT. My hair is thicker, longer and no longer falls out like it used to. This works better than any other product I have tried. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered some new hair growth on my scalp. This is the real deal and actually helps hair grow again. I tried other products but this works best for me. I will be using it from now on and hope the results continue to progress.</li>
    <li> Since I’ve been diagnosed with alopecia I have lost all hope for my hair ever returning. Surprisingly I started to see progress when using this product even though I didn’t think it would do much. At this point I see my hair is growing back, albeit very slowly. I’m just very happy I have found something that does work and praying it continues to help me further.</li>
    <li> I love the natural ingredients and appreciate that its made locally. It makes me feel much better taking a product I can trust. On to the results, they’ve been better than expected and my has grown an extra inch this month. Not just that but the hair fall has decreased significantly.</li>
    <li> Got a little thicker but not longer at all</li>
    <li> This product has a punch to it! After using it my hair has become noticeably thicker. I can see an actual difference in the mirror and others have been asking me what I’ve been doing to my hair since it started to get thicker.</li>
    <li> I have been on dasgro for 3 months and slowly but surely it restored my hairline. It’s not perfect but the difference is night and day. When people see me they can’t believe how much more hair I have now. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I have been using this 4 months, hair looks amazing, it&#x27;s growing fast, strong and no longer falls out like it used to. I haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects which is great. I would recommend trying it to see how it works for you, it definitely worked for me. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I’m always worried about possible side effects of the products I use and I made sure that this would not cause any. I did research on the ingredients and learned the product consisted of herbs and vitamins that are all natural. I then took the ingredients list to my family doctor, just as a precaution, and he looked it over and gave me the thumbs up. I then started to use the product for a few months and noticed no side effects. But more importantly I ended up getting some really good results during the 2 months I used it (more so on my second bottle). From my experience this is a quality product that is safe, natural and works!</li>
    <li> I’ve had an incredible experience with this product. I used this because I had a receding hairline that was killing my confidence. After 3 months my hairline slowly came back and my confidence with it! I could write a lot more but bottom line is this product is a life changer. I can’t promise it will work the same for everyone but my personal experience has been nothing short of a miracle. Thank youuu!</li>
    <li> This product is absolute incredible.  I have noticed I am now growing new hairs on my scalp thanks to dasgro hair formula! The vitamins in this are the best!!</li>
    <li> I figured anything good for the hair is also good for nails and skin. There wasn&#x27;t any noticeable improvement in any of these areas, but I have only been taking it for less than a month.</li>
    <li> After a year and a half of steady handfuls of hair loss-- so very distressing for a woman who has had thick beautiful healthy curls all her life-- I started Das Grow about 6 months ago. Granted, I&#x27;ve tried beau coup other supplements along the way and continue to, but Das Grow has seemed to make a HUGE difference!&lt;br /&gt;My hair had become dry, lost its curl and after ruling out some medical causes ( no thyroid problems or auto-immune) I was SO bummed. My doc said it was either hormonal, (I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s) dietary or stress (got a WHOLE lotta that going on--who doesn&#x27;t?)&lt;br /&gt;BUT!  I now have new hair growth around my forehead, my over-all hair is growing like crazy, it&#x27;s tending to curl again, AND: when I run my hands thru it dry I no longer come up with human &amp;#34;hair balls&amp;#34;! Same in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I have never written a review before, but I want (women) who have lost hair and hope that THIS STUFF WORKS!  Be patient and persistent. I take it at night because all the B vitamins make me a bit queasy during the day. Good luck!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product! Just a few days of use and I have begun to see some progress in the health of my hair. I didn’t think it would start working as quickly as it has but the early results make me excited for what is achievable with long term use. I will update my review in a few months but the early results are very good.</li>
    <li> My hair was embarrassingly thin and had been that way for a while… I decided I needed to do something about it and my research lead me to dasgro. When I first started using the product I wasn’t entirely convinced it was working but the longer I used it the more I noticed my hair was improving. After a few months it was so much thicker that others started to notice around me. I just ordered more and highly recommend dasgro to others with thinning hair or general hair loss IT REALLY HELPS!!</li>
    <li> I have found this product has provided many benefits. It was able to stop my hair loss and has steadily helped restore a lot of balding on my head – not overnight but over a few months – and last but not least it has improved the color there are a lot more dark hairs on my head now to the point where Ive had others ask if I colored my hair recently.</li>
    <li> I use dasgro because it’s natural and doesn’t make me sick but most importantly because it works! It has done wonders for my hair. My hair loss is a thing of the past and my hair has become longer than it has been years!!! I recommend this!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! l started two weeks ago and my hair is growing, l&#x27;ve tried everything u can think of to vitamins, conditioners, moisturizers you name it.&amp;#34; Im here to stay&amp;#34;. I will come back with an update in a month</li>
    <li> I have alopecia and my hair is thinning rapidly. I was told not much could be done for my alopecia but surprisingly after using this product I noticed reversal in some of the thinning and balding areas on my head. My advice, don’t give up and try this out! If it has worked this well for me then I am sure it can work for others too.</li>
    <li> Not good at all... don&#x27;t waste your money, just buy regular vitamins for less money.</li>
    <li> I just started dasgro hair formula on 9/12/14 and i haven&#x27;t seen result yet for my hair. i read most of the reviews results on dasgro hair formula web @dasgro.com and at amazon and  both webs are positive. well maybe i should order from dasgro hair formula instead of amazon so i can get my money back.</li>
    <li> My doc told me about this product since she knows that my body reacts very poorly to chemical treatments and this one is natural and doesn’t contain anything that could be harmful to me. The best part is that it actually started to work within weeks. My hair loss has slowed down to a halt and looks healthier, feels great too!</li>
    <li> This product really works! I have been using it for just over 30 days and I have seen my hair make a complete transformation. I used to have these gross bald patches that are filling in nicely. When I vacuum I notice less hair on the floor which has always bothered me but now I feel like I can beat my hair loss. I love the product so far!</li>
    <li> trust me people or buyers this is BS...  Stealing everybody&#x27;s money</li>
    <li> I started taking this product 6 weeks ago and there is no denying that it has helped me grow my hair. Not just that, but it did stop it from shedding too!</li>
    <li> I have had thin hair for all my life but after I had kids it started really falling out.  I haven&#x27;t really tried anything else besides shampoos. But I heard really good things about Dasgro so I thought I would give it a try.  I just finished my first bottle and purchased my second bottle to give the three months a go.  Not sure how I feel... I haven&#x27;t really seem much of a difference and my hair is still falling out. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong or if there&#x27;s more that I can do. I am feeling skeptical but will give it the three months.  I will update my review after the second bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product found 2months and i see new hairs growing .i like the product so far.l have just ordered that 90 day supply.thanks Dasgro.  Margaret. Jones</li>
    <li> I have used for 90 days as recommended.  Unfortunately, my hair feels, and appears even thinner. Clearly DasGro didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do nothing for me waste $42.00</li>
    <li> so far {after one bottle } I have noticed much less hair in the drain. As far as hair re-growth, not yet, but it is probably too soon to tell. Ordered a second bottle. Willing to keep it up for at least 3 months.</li>
    <li> Great product I have had amazing results so far! I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> It is kind of early to tell (I have only been taking DasGro for about 3-4 weeks) but I feel like I see less hair on my hand when washing my hair, so I am encouraged to keep taking it to see if my hair starts to come back in.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely perfect product. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product work better than most hair growth products out there. I&#x27;m in my early 20s and I slightly noticed my hair was thinning. I was shredding hair everywhere. After brushing and combing my hair or showering i would lose significant amount of hair. This product doesn&#x27;t work right away for me as it does for other claimed users, it took me a month for me to see changes. This would be my first month using dasgro, and I&#x27;m loving it. My hair is stronger than before because I don&#x27;t see any hair falling out like before. I would continue to use this product and hopefully by next month my hair would grow back. I will try to keep my review updated every month.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mom, she loves it, so far no side effect. She has been using for about 3weeks and her hair is much fuller on top and shinier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/15/2015&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Mom&#x27;s hair is now past her shoulders and now the top of her head is way fuller, you can hardly notice her scalp.  Her hair is very thin and fragile and usually takes a while to grow 1/2 an inch.  Still no side effects for her.  She is sooo excited that this is doing wonders for her.</li>
    <li> Love it..really help my,fine hair healthier</li>
    <li> Have only used it a few months, but it seems like it is helping with new hair growth.</li>
    <li> Hair length is longer and feels much stronger and thicker. So far I really like it and plan to use it for a while</li>
    <li> I have looked everywhere and tried everything and this product is the only one that has worked for my thinning hair. I have been getting all sorts of compliments and my hair is thicker than ever!</li>
    <li> I got my pills on april 1 I can see no growth difference probably too soon but I can feel after two weeks the texture and its soft and its completely stopped shedding. I&#x27;m 29 with fine curly hair and recently its been falling out in chunks. This product has stopped that. Was recommended by my mom who has never had edges and now... Thick edges after 2 months. Give it time people.took your whole life to lose it so don&#x27;t expect miracles overnight</li>
    <li> Definitely made my hair softer and feeling smoother.</li>
    <li> It makes you hair a little more oily and I have not seen any results at all.</li>
    <li> i have completed 4 months of taking these pills. Though my hair fall became less noticeable but it was not that impressive and&lt;br /&gt;moreover i did not see any new hair growth.  After 4 months i started taking only one pill a day as i didnt see any significant change.&lt;br /&gt;After a week or so my hair started falling again. I doubt its like minoxidil , once you stop taking hair fall starts. And also there is very&lt;br /&gt;high amount of Vitamin A which is not good in long run, this will in turn make your hair fall more.</li>
    <li> I got this product on a recommendation and didn’t think it would help... well IT DID! I was shocked and so relieved to see that I had an almost immediate decrease in hair loss and now my hair is starting to grow. Do not pass up on this product; it works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> Amazing results! Where has this product been my whole life!? After only 2 weeks I started to see peach fuzz growth on thinnest areas on the scalp. It has been a month now and those areas are continuing to grow hair. This product is absolutely amazing and worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I have been on this product for 30 days and can’t believe the reduction in hairfal and just the other week I started to get new hair growth around the hairline and top of my head. My brother noticed the other day and has just ordered the product for himself. I would recommend this to others in a heartbeat… the results speak for themselves.</li>
    <li> A co-worker purchased this for me, and he raved about this Dasgro Hair Formula, but I was skeptical. I had tried numerous other hair products that helped my existing hair grow, but did nothing to grow back the hair already lost from years of thinning. So I had very low expectations when I started using DasGro Hair Formula. I stuck with it for the 3 months, and to be honest I thought for sure it wasn’t working. Boy was I wrong. Lucky for me, I started to see a huge improvement on my second bottle. I just finished my third bottle and this product has exceeded my expectations ten-fold! My hair is no longer falling out, and the areas where my hair was previously thinning came back to life in full thickness.Try it for yourself, it’s an awesome product!</li>
    <li> Only thing worked for me</li>
    <li> I noticed new hair growth on my balding patch. I really like the product because it doesn’t require me to apply anything to the actual scalp, just pop 2 tablets a day and that’s it. It’s also natural and doesn’t cause a bunch of nasty side effects.</li>
    <li> I heard about these on a talk show and got them right away. I love the ingredients and the fact that it’s fully natural with no preservatives. Right away my scalp showed some early signs of progress when my hairfall reduced and when my existing hair started to gain thickness and shine. It’s only been a few weeks so I can’t write about the long term results but will come back and update this review once I’m done 3 months.</li>
    <li> I nearly lost hope after buying so many different products but I can honestly say that dasgro hair formula made an actual difference. I noticed results rather quickly and did end up completing 3 months with it as suggested. After the 3 months my hair is better than it has been in years, it’s so much thicker and healthier. It has filled in a tiny bald spot on the top of my head and improved the overall color. Highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> My doctor is the one that got me using this and the results have been awesome. My hair loss stopped and most of the patchy areas have thickened up and aren’t noticeable like before. After some research I learned that this is sourced and manufactured locally instead of overseas which is always reassuring. I highly recommend giving dasgro a try, it works great!</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this product based on all of the reviews I read. I was patient and even though I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable results within the first 60 days, I continued to take the vitamins faithfully. After completing the 90 days, I can say that this product didn&#x27;t work for me as the company claims. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I don’t normally feel the need to write anything but found this product exceptionally good at stopping my hair loss. I like the fact it’s made here in the USA and that it contains only natural ingredients. These things are very important to me and if they are to you then this is a great safe option that WORKS!</li>
    <li> Hair is fuller, thicker and growing out nicely. Love this product and will order more</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a month, but it seems to be helping. I have had very little hair falling out and seems to be growing quicker. I just placed an order for 3 more bottles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK I guess.  I really haven&#x27;t seen any significant changes in my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered a bottle to test it out and started taking it as soon as it came. On my first week I found my hair was falling out less. Not bad for 1 week! I hope the long term results are even better. I will update at a later time.</li>
    <li> My hair was a mess and shedding EVERYWHERE. I was terrified that I would soon be bald and went on a journey to find the best hair growth product that would be effective and safe. I found dasgro hair formula after reading some testimonials and gave it a try. It was the best decision ever because shortly after my hair stopped falling out and today I see so few hairs around the house which makes me grateful and happy. My hair looks fantastic and it’s full of life again… as soon as I run out I’m getting more.</li>
    <li> Tried about a dozen products to help my hair grow again and dasgro hair vitamins were the only ones that produced real results in less than 30 days. I’m now several months in and continue to see great results! This is a must have for anyone with hair loss.</li>
    <li> I’m on my third week and already seeing some great progress on my hairline. I also noticed less daily hair loss. So far this product has exceeded my expectations and I’m excited to see the type of results I can get with long term use.</li>
    <li> Call me nuts but I started to see progress on my first week. I know this isn’t the norm but was pleasantly surprised to notice the effects this early on and feel like a few months will have a tremendously positive impact, wish me luck!</li>
    <li> It has been 6 weeks and my hairfall is down by about 90%. I used to find my hair all over the house and now it’s just a few hairs here and there. My existing hair is also thicker and has more life to it. I have done nothing else during this period with my diet or lifestyle so I know this is the only thing that it could be!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken DasGrow for a month and 1/2. It is a slow process but I believe I feel some growth around the front edges. I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
    <li> I started seeing hair regrowth in 2 weeks at the top of my head where I have a bald spot forming. Hair also appears thicker than prior to starting. So far I’m pleased and excited.</li>
    <li> In 2011 I had a ponytail that pulled out my hair in the back of my head because of the hair glue.I tried all types of products to regrow my hair and I didn&#x27;t get any results.I did lots of research and finally found this site for Dasgro.I started reading the reviews and a lot of the stories that I read the people were experiencing the same problems as me.I am a 50 year old African American woman and I have thin/fine hair.I purchased the 3 month supply because a lot of the reviews said that you would receive better results.I started taking Dasgro on November 1,2014 and I have hair growth covering that big bald spot on the back of my head after 2 months.I will continue to take this amazing product until my hair grows as long as it wants too.</li>
    <li> If you are losing your hair then try this, worked great for me and it’s natural so I didn’t have to worry about a bunch of side effects.</li>
    <li> Thanks DasGro! I tried my first 1-month supply a few months ago and immediately noticed that my brush didn&#x27;t have as many hairs in it on a daily basis. I took this product before Christmas and many family I hadn&#x27;t seen commented on the life and body and shine that my hair had. Prior to purchasing I did look for the best product out there and the vitamins it contains are a huge plus! From the research I had been doing, I have been wanting to take a supplement that contained copper **as it has been proven that copper helps thwart grey hair!**. As a 40 something year old I am dreading the day when I get greys and need to use hair color!!! This is the best alternative I have found! :) **Vanity at it&#x27;s finest, I suppose!**</li>
    <li> I didn’t think it would do much but luckily I was wrong. I’ve had great success and my hair has started to grow back out in recent weeks. This product is the real deal and I’m glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I’ve been suffering from hair loss since my early twenties and not much has helped… that is until I found the dasgro product. I began using it as directed and have experienced fantastic results in only a month. This is a must have product for hair loss and I am glad I found it, just in time too!</li>
    <li> I’ve been using DasGro Hair Formula for nearly 6 months and in that time I’ve seen my hair transform (in a good way). I had ridiculous amount of thinning that is now barely noticeable. Now my hair is super thick and I can’t stop putting my hands through it. I was told I can reduce the dosage and even stop the product but when it’s working this good I am not going to take any chances. I am a customer for life and this product is everything I had hoped for. Thank you so very much!!</li>
    <li> I can’t believe how great this has been working for my hair. I’ve seen steady improvement and hair growth over the 3 weeks I’ve been using it. These are much better than any other hair growth vitamin I have used and I plan to use this one from now on.</li>
    <li> made my nails grow nice &amp; healthy</li>
    <li> I haven’t even been on it for 30 days yet and I’m starting to see great results. I love that the product is made locally in an FDA location. The extra biotin is great too, it has replaced my biotin supplement and I get more benefit using this formula. I’m happy with it!</li>
    <li> I have been using DasGro Hair Formula for 4 months and have had incredible success with this product. My hair was terribly thin, especially on top but after using this product it began to thicken up. I love the texture and fullness I have now! This stuff is amazing so if you’re looking for thicker, fuller and overall healthier hair then get dasgro!</li>
    <li> I almost didn’t get it but after some research decided to give it a chance. It turned out to be a great decision because my hair is finally growing back after years of shedding and thinning. I will report back after finishing my full 3 month supply but can’t believe how great it’s been and I’m only on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only into the 2nd month with this product and noticing the different.  Less loss and new hair are growing.  Will update again when it is more visible.</li>
    <li> Amazing results in only 3 weeks of using it. Everyone around me is wondering what I’m using now. Do not pass up on this product if you want natural hair growth!</li>
    <li> I have noticed less shedding, used to get tons of my hair on the pillow and in the drain and this has done wonders. I also noticed my hair feels softer and has better texture, more fullness and is darker than it used to be. No ill effects or anything worrisome like that, overall very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> DasGro Hair Formula has helped me hair grow stronger while improving the texture, length and overall health of my hair. I wasn’t balding but did have some hair loss and this put an end to that… huge relief! I’m pleased with the results and will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> I tried quite a few products and this is the ONLY product that has been able to produce REAL results. My hair has stopped shedding and is now showing signs of regrowth. I’m a bit older now so expecting too much but this has exceeded my expectation in every way.</li>
    <li> Give it time to work and it will do amazing things for you! My progress started off slow and really started to show in my second and third month. I have more hair now on my scalp than I’ve had in years!</li>
    <li> I tried like 40 different things and there is no doubt that this has been by far the single most effective product that has helped me stop my hair loss and grow my hair. The results happened quickly, within a week and continued to progress from there. No side effects at all… I’ve stopped all other products and have switched over to this.</li>
    <li> I have used this dasgro hair  formula..  Two times i finished the 1st bottle.or 60 tablet. And i didn&#x27;t  see  any changes so what can i do to grow  my hair. ?</li>
    <li> I have been using DasGro consistently for 4 months.  After losing my hair to chemo treatments 6 years ago, my hair only came in about 2/3 of what it was.  The strands are much thinner and less hair came back.  After reading reviews I decided to buy a six month supply, I couldn&#x27;t pass up the deal.  I was hoping after 4 months to see a fuller head of hair.  I must say I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.  It made somewhat of a difference in the length, but it doesn&#x27;t seem much thicker or fuller.  I can still see my scalp.  I&#x27;ll continue to use DasGro for the entire 6 months, and hope to see some improvement.</li>
    <li> It’s been 3 weeks and I’m starting to see signs of new hair growth on my scalp. I’m very excited and happy to see something work for me. No side effects so far. I’ll write more in 3 months.</li>
    <li> I used this product because it’s natural and I’m sensitive to many other products I’ve used. I wasn’t sure what to expect but surprisingly got some great results while using this. The other day I looked in the mirror and found new hairs on my hairline… it’s only been 2 months.</li>
    <li> It worked fast to rejuvenate my hair and restore some of the damaged follicles that have been caused by a recent brain surgery. They had to shave my scalp and I had a hard time growing out my hair after that but now that I’ve started using DasGro Hair Formula it’s growing again.</li>
    <li> I tried so many products that I’ve pretty much lost hope that my hair would ever come back. I thought this would be just another one of those types of products but it really did end up working for me. I’m still a bit shocked but very grateful that I’ve finally found a product that has started to regrow my hair.</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me by a friend and has worked wonderfully. My hair is the healthiest it’s ever been. It has stopped falling out and is growing out longer and stronger. No side effects and it’s easy to swallow.</li>
    <li> DasGro Hair Formula helped restore most of my hairline in just 3 months. I took it every day; two tablets in the morning and within weeks noticed my first signs of progress. 3 months later and my hairline looks like it did a decade ago!! This product is the real deal and a must have for anyone with hair loss.</li>
    <li> The product works. It has strengthened my hair follicles and my hair no longer falls out. My hair has become thicker, longer and looks amazing. I just ordered 3 more months and hope it continues to work so I can have my beautiful hair back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting amazing results using this! My hair looks better than it did years ago before all my hair loss started. I have not experienced any side effects when taking the 2 tablets per day. Great product and totally worth it!</li>
    <li> My hair has been aggressively shedding and I was scared that I would eventually need a wig if it didn’t stop. I used dasgro after reading positive reviews and took it religiously for a few months. The hair loss is now under control and my hair looks and feels healthier. The relief can’t be put into words and my confidence is through the roof. I feel so much less stressed and I’m happy that this product works for me.</li>
    <li> I use this because it contains 4000 biotin amongst all the other great ingredients. My hair and scalp are so much healthier and the hair growth is noticeable. This is a must have for your those dealing with hair loss.</li>
    <li> after a month, I see a difference, as does others around me! Need to order more!</li>
    <li> I am normally shedding hairs like crazy but since starting up on DasGro hair formula I have noticed a big difference. My hair thickness, texture, and shine have improved as well. I take 2 tablets per day with meals and have not experienced side effects. I am a happy camper and I’ll continue to use it!</li>
    <li> After 7 days I started to get less daily hair loss. I used to clog up the drain (gross) and now I’m finding very few hairs there. I will continue to use the product for the full 3 months but so far it’s been great.</li>
    <li> I’ve been on dasgro for 3 weeks and have started to see new hairs growing near my hairline and on all the thinned out areas of my scalp. The hair is just starting to grow out so it’s going to take some time to fill in these areas but the fact it’s growing is wonderful.</li>
    <li> It helps my hair grow and makes it look thick and full. It doesn’t cause side effects like many other products. This is a must have for anyone who wants a natural hair growth product that delivers real results.</li>
    <li> Over the years I’ve developed some serious widows peak on my hairline. My journey to find a solution led me to dasgro hair formula. I was a bit skeptical since I never used anything like this before but figured I would give it a shot. A few months later my hairline started to regrow, I stuck with it and have been using the product for a full 6 months. I can’t believe how different my hairline looks. This product has been a true blessing and I’m forever grateful to have found it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Too many products cause nasty side effects. That’s why I was drawn to this product because it uses only natural ingredients and doesn’t cause all those side effects. I wasn’t sure what to expect, that said, soon after taking 2 tablets per day I began noticing my hairfall decreasing and a few weeks after that the fullness and texture improved. A few months into using this product I started to get new hair growth near the top and sides of my head. I’m very pleased with this product and will use it as long as it keeps working.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I have new hair growth all over my head!! No unwanted hair growth anywhere else and no side effects. I noticed my first results in 2 weeks and it felt like it compounded from there. Give it time if it doesn’t work right away, I’m glad I did!</li>
    <li> After years of my hairline slowly receding I was able to reverse the damage in just a few months by taking these tablets. It’s incredible and the results have exceeded my wildest expectations. I have not seen any reversal and I’m now down to only half the dosage.</li>
    <li> It stopped my hair loss and helped me get my hair back! It exceeded my expectations in every sense of the word and I feel lucky to have found a product that works as advertised. I hope others find it as helpful as I did. I highly recommend it, it’s worth the try!</li>
    <li> Losing hair is horrible. I recently turned 55 and knew that it was time for a change to not lose my hair. I changed my diet but it was not enough. I’ve used it completely and ordered a new one, it really worked and made my hair a lot stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller offered this supplement for free, only if I’d give a NON biased review.</li>
    <li> BETTER THAN MOST OTHER HAIR LOSS TREATMENTS. IT WORKS WITHOUT THE SIDE EFFECTS AND YOU SEE RESULTS QUICKLY! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It’s natural, doesn’t cause me any side effects and has been helping my hair grow back. It’s not an overnight solution but the results are real and permanent. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working. My hair is growing pretty fast. I had severe chemical damage that caused hair breakage down to the root. In February/March I had hair so short on top of my head that it stood straight up like sprouts; barely an 1/8&amp;#34;. 4 months later the same area is about 3-4 inches. I&#x27;ve been very faithful about taking these, one in the morning, one in the afternoon.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks I have seen less hair shedding and my hair has grown longer. I feel these are great results for just a few weeks, 5 stars so far!</li>
    <li> Be wary of this product. Purchased over a month ago and have not noticed any real improvement. That being said, my real concern is the ingredients. I doubt many do real research on the possible side effects of the ingredients of their supplements. Specifically, there is 100 mg of vitamin b6....5000% of the RDA. high doses of B6 over extended periods can cause nerve damage. Yes b vitamins are water soluble vitamins flushed out in the urine but depending on kidney and liver health they can linger in the organs and be toxic. Calcium and vitamin c can also be problematic for the arteries and kidneys. Do your research. Had I known the levels of certain ingredients were so high I would&#x27;ve saved my money.</li>
    <li> My hair has been thin and balding for some time and I almost lost hope that it would ever come back. A friend of mine recommended I try dasgro hair formula and since I had very little to lose I decided I would give it a shot. I took the product every single day for 3 months and slowly but surely by hair started coming back! It wasn’t an overnight type of thing and it did take time but the patience paid off big time! I feel more confident than ever and my hair looks like it used to years ago before all the balding and thinning.</li>
    <li> I started taking DasGRo Hair about two weeks ago and their has been some change in my hair texture. It is  getting stronger and some of the thinning spots are growing back. I have not had any side effects. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping still working  with it</li>
    <li> Call me crazy but on day 5 I started to notice some changes in my hair, the good kind!! I’m pleased with the early results. Already the product has exceeded my expectations and it hasn’t even been a week.</li>
    <li> I’ve been on it for several months love what it has done for me! I used to have lifeless, flat and thinned out hair but then started using dasgro and my hair improved rapidly. It’s far thicker now and the color has improved along the way. Hair regrowth became apparent towards my second bottle and so far has not shown any signs of falling back out. Simply put, this is the best hair growth product out there! It works and its better value than the alternative treatments.</li>
    <li> On my first bottle my hair looked healthier, fuller and the hair shedding was significantly reduced. On my second bottle I started to see regrowth in my problematic areas. I just started my third bottle and I’m continuing to see good progress.</li>
    <li> These are the best natural hair growth vitamins I have ever used. I was using another product and decided to switch over to see if this one would get better results and I was shocked to see how quickly I started to see progress. Less hair loss, more hair growth, better color, hair was shinier, softer, longer, all within my first 30 days. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend these to anyone who needs a little help, or perhaps a lot of help with their hair.</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients, I love that it’s natural and most importantly I love what it did for my hair. I look in the mirror and actually feel proud of what I see. I barely lose any hair now and have been getting a lot of questions about what I’ve been doing to it. These have not only provided great results but have given me a much needed confidence boost. Do not pass up on this wonderful product, it truly works!</li>
    <li> Been using this for 3 months with no side effects. Hair growth is apparent and has been steady. I look every week in the mirror and there is no denying the progress. This product is a life changer and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product is powerful and works quickly to stop hair loss and regrow hair. I have personally seen some amazing results that have shocked me and even those around me. The rate at which my hair is regrowing is unbelievable but a blessing, and I can’t wait to see what a few more months on this product will produce. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I’m very excited to say that my hair is finally growing back after 2 months of using DasGro Hair Formula. This product is the real deal and works wonderfully. It’s worth every penny and I would definitely recommend using it.</li>
    <li> After trying just about everything this product has done the trick! My hair is growing back!! Wow. This is exactly what I needed… wish I found it sooner. Best product for hair growth hands down.</li>
    <li> My hair has been falling out for quite some time. I started using this based on a recommendation and I’m happy to report that after 3 weeks I have seen my first bit of new hair growth on my scalp. This product is an absolute must have for anyone looking for a natural hair growth solution that doesn’t cause side effects.</li>
    <li> I tried just about every product out there and finally settled on DasGro Hair Formula. It proved to be the most effective at stopping my hair from falling out. What sealed the deal was the new hair growth I was able to get in less than 2 months while using this product. It doesn’t cause side effects and for the price you simply can’t go wrong. Trust me, save your money and get this!!</li>
    <li> My hair grows very slowly and I needed something to help it grow out faster. One month of this did the trick! I also noticed that I do not have to straighten as much. I am happy and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Helped me stop my hair loss and regrow a big patch of hair that was missing on my scalp. I’ve had no side effects and find it very easy to take with only 2 tablets per day. Many other products had me applying foams or as many as 6 pills per day but with this one it’s easy and it works!</li>
    <li> I’ve been balding for quite some time. I was considering surgery until I realized the cost is excessive. Tried this instead since it’s far more affordable. It’s been 3 weeks and I do see a difference when I look in the mirror. Family and friends have seen it too! Only time will tell if the results continue this way.</li>
    <li> I had nearly lost all hope and was just going to accept my baldness. I tried DasGro Hair Formula as a last ditch effort and lo and behold it actually ended up working for me. Of course it took some time but it beats losing all of it and eventually being bald. The effects of this product compounded the longer I used it so if you do not see results immediately do not get discouraged and keep taking it. Had I stopped on my first few weeks I would have missed the crazy growth that occurred on my second month.</li>
    <li> Having very thin hair which continuously fall, I was looking for anything that would control this. Luckily I was provided DasGro for free. I tried and after just 2 weeks both my hair problems gradually decreased and now they are down to minimum. I think you should try this product too if u have hair issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I rececivd this bottle for free, but I am not obligate to leave any reviews. My opinion is unbiased.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!! I started using DasGro 4 weeks ago, I notice results almost immediately, I was surprise that this hair product worked so fast... I love! However it is a bit high in price considering it last for only 4 weeks. Although I love this product, I don&#x27;t think I will continue to use it, but I highly recommend it to anyone who want their hair to grow fast... 5 stars for DasGro. Again I think this hair product is awesome...</li>
    <li> I’ve had a great experience with dasgro hair formula, it has really helped curb the hair shedding and now my hair is growing again!! I’m relieved and excited to see something working for me!</li>
    <li> Tried a few other brands but this one has given me the best results and I’ve decided to stick with it. I take the 2 tablets per day with food and have not experienced any ill effects. The hair looks fantastic, not shedding anymore, and it’s growing long and strong!</li>
    <li> It really works! I&#x27;ve been using DasGro for two months now and have noticed new growth on top of my head. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Worked well for me, hair loss is less apparent and hair is growing like never before. I would recommend it to others with hair loss that want a natural product that works.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural hair growth product out there. It stopped my hair loss and I started to see new hair growth on my third week. No other product out there has been this effective!</li>
    <li> Been on it for 3 weeks, so far I’m impressed and noticing less hair shedding around the house. I will continue to use for the recommended 3 months and report back when I’m done.</li>
    <li> I’ve tried so many products that I’ve lost count. dasgro hair vitamins have been the most noticeably effective in terms of new hair growth and overall hair health. Just as importantly there have been no side effects with this product which is rare because many of the others I tried gave me a lot of trouble. Overall I’m very pleased with daasgro and plan to use it for a long time.</li>
    <li> If you’re looking for natural results then dasgro delivers like no other product I have tried. The ingredients are some of the best for stopping hair loss and helping with hair growth. I have personally seen some great results and didn’t have to wait months even though they recommend it. Obviously everyone is a bit different but this product is worth a try and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants their hair back.</li>
    <li> I have been taking for 5 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any change. My hair still breaks and feels thinner. I ordered 3 month supply and will continue to use to give it more time but if it sounds to good to be true it usually is.</li>
    <li> Wow, blown away by the amazing results!! I have tried so many different things and seeing new hair growth in less than 30 days is astonishing, finally something that really works! I just ordered 3 more bottles!</li>
    <li> Better than most other products out there and does not cause any side effects. It helped me get my hair loss under control while improving the overall health of my hair. If you’re looking for an effective natural solution to hair loss then this is worth a try.</li>
    <li> Give it a little more time, I&#x27;m seeing some new sprouts throughout my head.</li>
    <li> I know it sounds crazy but I’ve been on this product and started seeing hair growth on my first week! I just finished my first bottle and I’m waiting for my next order to come in. This is a must have product for anyone dealing with hair loss.</li>
    <li> WoW! This product works quick! I’m not shedding my hair everywhere and it seems my hair is fuller and softer. I also noticed some peach fuzz hair growth, it’s still early but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I gave them to my granddaughter not sure how they work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now. Have not seen any difference in hair growth or texture. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> It’s not easy to find a product that works and doesn’t cause side effects but DasGro Hair Formula did the trick for me. The product has been insanely effective and has produced some amazing results in terms of slowing down my hair loss and helping with hair growth. Not only has it been effective but I have not experienced any side effects and have been using the product for 4 months now. I strongly recommend those looking for a solution to their hair problems to try DasGro for themselves. Be patient with the product and give it time to work, I did and I couldn’t be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> I researched many products and eventually settled on DasGro because it’s one of the few products out there that uses natural ingredients and isn’t some sort of oil or cream. Fortunately the product has done wonders for my hair and it’s looking amazing after just a few short weeks. I’ll come back and leave a more detailed review when I’ve had a chance to use it for a few months but the early results are there!!</li>
    <li> Just started 2 weeks ago but hair loss has already started to slow down and hair looks much better.</li>
    <li> I am about a month in and have noticed a lot less hairs in the drain and on my pillow. I am going to continue to use it and see what happens.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has really made a difference since I started using it a few months ago. My friend has been asking me what I have changed because she says my hair has really thickened up. I also see the same thing and I am very happy with the results. I should mention that I have tried a few other products and nothing has worked quite as quickly or as effectively as this one. I would recommend this over many other products out there so don’t waste your money on anything else and give this a try.</li>
    <li> I noticed new hair growth on my hairline in the past week! I still haven’t finished a full 3 months so I’ll come back and report more when I do.</li>
    <li> I followed directions on the bottle, however it upsets my stomach.  I do take it with food. I see a little improvement with my new hair coming in. Added bonus.. my eye lashes have gotten longer.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product 6 weeks and so far so good… hair loss has decreased significantly!!! I have experienced no side effects. This product is great value when you consider some of the more expensive treatments and I would recommend trying it if you want to decrease or stop hair loss.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great customer service, fast results (about 2 weeks I noticed a difference) and no side effects. I would recommend this to anyone looking to reduce or eliminate their hair loss.</li>
    <li> I love it! I am a Black woman in my mid 40&#x27;s  and I will not live without it. I saw an improvement in the center of my head within eight weeks. It was probably noticeable before but I didn&#x27;t look. My hair is continuing to grow and be healthy. I do take it with a multi-vitamin so that my body does not use the nutrients elsewhere. You have nothing to lose in trying it, either way your body gets nutrients that it didn&#x27;t have before!</li>
    <li> Being too se results in a month</li>
    <li> i did not see any difference</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mom who has thinning hair and always stresses out about it. She started using this and within her first month asked me to buy more because it started thickening up her hair. Now I am stuck buying her this but I am glad shes happy.</li>
    <li> I have to be very careful what I take due to stomach issues so I tried dasgro hair formula and I’m happy to report no side effects, hair seems to be improving at a steady pace, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I feel this product works better with time. My first month I noticed some progress but the longer I used it the more I noticed that it was working. Now I can’t see myself ever stopping! I know you can but why would I want to if my hair is finally growing again!</li>
    <li> This is great, it has helped my hair grow like nothing else! The texture, feel, shine and fullness have all improved over the last month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on it for two months and haven&#x27;t seen any clear results.</li>
    <li> My hair is starting to grow after 3 weeks. I don’t take anything else with it but try to keep a healthy lifestyle.</li>
    <li> In my experience this is by far the most effective hair loss remedy that won’t cause side effects. There are products out there that can match the effectiveness but cause unwanted side effects. I have taken this product for 6 months, 2 tablets per day and have yet to experience anything that would worry me. The best part is just how amazing this products works, especially if you give it a few months to really get going. Do yourself a favor and give this a try and I promise you won’t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am still using it, haven&#x27;t seen any changes as yet, it&#x27;s my first bottle but will continue to see what happens</li>
    <li> I went from embarrassingly thin hair that was atrocious to look at (from certain angles) to longer, thicker and just healthier hair in general. I don’t have to do anything crazy to hide the thin areas (because they are non-existent) and it’s nice to walk outside knowing that my hair looks great, such an amazing relief.</li>
    <li> Noticed hair growth in less than 30 days and I’m very excited for what the next few months will bring. I will try to come back and update this every month, the initial results have surpassed my expectations.</li>
    <li> I have stubborn hair that won’t grow past a certain length but after using this product it started to finally grow.</li>
    <li> First month was a bit slow but now finally seeing some great results in the second month, can’t wait to see what month three will bring.</li>
    <li> It’s a part of my daily routine and it has made my hair fuller, thicker and longer. The tablets are easy to take, you just do 1 in the morning with food and one in the afternoon with food 2 and that’s it, then just watch your hair grow!</li>
    <li> This product does wonders for my hair. I just ran out and anxiously waiting for my next 3 bottles… I wish I knew about it sooner!</li>
    <li> I have been using dasgro hair formula for quite some time and in fact have stopped taking all other hair supplements because of the great results that this one product has provided. You will not be disappointed; it really stops your hair from shedding and provides the scalp with essential nutrients that will help it grow back.</li>
    <li> This stopped my hair from thinning and falling out.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I just take 2 tablets every day and my hair has become fuller, thicker and stronger. I can actually pull on the hair without pulling it out! I love the way it looks now, feeling confident with great hair!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet, but there is still hope.</li>
    <li> been using for 2 months and I am starting to see new hair growth around my crown.. excited to see more results. worth a try!!</li>
    <li> For know on my first month my hair stopped falling a 70% ands it thicker than it usually was also it is growing really fast.. I&#x27;ll see what happens next month and I&#x27;ll post my results.</li>
    <li> After four months, I saw no benefit whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair thick and full. My hair used to be super thin and this has helped thicken it up so that my scalp isn’t showing. I’ve tried other stuff but dasgro has been the only product that has worked without causing side effects.</li>
    <li> If you’ve tried everything and are frustrated with not seeing results then try this. I did and was not expecting much BUT after 2 months my hair has improved tremendously. It’s thicker, longer and I have more of it, not to mention it not falling out like it used to. This product is the real deal and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> There has been a huge improvement in hair growth and less breakage. I noticed some new hair growth too. The early signs are encouraging and so far this product has exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I was losing hair for the last few years and it’s been getting to the point where parts of scalp now show. I became depressed over this and started to try different treatments and remedies. Nothing would work, then one day a friend suggested DasGro Hair Vitamins and I ordered it right away. Less than a week in I felt like it started to have an impact, a few weeks later my friend made some comments that my hair looked thicker which really validated that the product was working for me. I continued to use it and now have completely stopped losing my hair, other than a few strands it’s been fully stabilized. Now when my hair grows out it doesn’t fall out and my scalp is slowly starting to have that full head of hair look again.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist made some positive comments about my hair looking great and growing again… I noticed it too!</li>
    <li> I have a receding hairline and this has helped reverse it to the point where I am looking 10 years younger or at least feeling like it! Not sure if it works the same for everyone but it’s certainly worth the try,</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and not many things have worked for me but this one has really stood out with the results it has been able to provide. My hair looks great now, much healthier and growing nicely.</li>
    <li> I ordered it on a whim and figured what do I have to lose. To my surprise it stopped my hair loss in a matter of weeks and in a matter of months I started to see new hair growth. Even now I continue to see results, my friends and family have all noticed the changes. I’m beyond happy with this product and will continue to use it forever!</li>
    <li> so not worth it, saw no results</li>
    <li> THANK YOU SOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!! YOU ARE A LIFE SAVER!! I was miserable when i started to notice my hair thinning and a bald patch appearing right on top of my head. i almost lost all my 200% confidence, but guess what just one month in and i am back on top baby!! This product really works, please do not pass on this. I am so so so so sos osoooooooo greatful to whomever made this!! i love you to the core and THANK YOU GOD!! I am soooooo happy id drink to that!! please people try this please!!</li>
    <li> Bought from another site/seller.  Felt awful every time I tried it.  Felt nauseated.  I took it for a few days and finally tossed it.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you das gro is the truth I have been using it for 3 months and it has not only stopped my balding it has started to grow my hair back I wish I could post pictures on here because you would be blown away by the results I have gotten for some reason my account won&#x27;t let me post a picture but just know this is the best hair loss pill I have ever seen</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and I have recommended to many friends. I must say it has never disappointed any of us!</li>
    <li> Wait to see if it really work.</li>
    <li> I did the 90 day program and ordered the 3 bottles upfront. Each bottle last 1 month and contains 60 tablets. These tablets are not tiny but are about average in size, no odor or bad taste and I personally found them easy to swallow. I did 1 tablet in the morning with my coffee and breakfast and one at lunch with some food and water. I did not skip any days and after about 30 days or so I noticed my first results, nothing too major but noticeable enough to see that something was happening. At around the 60 day mark there was a much more noticeable change everything from length, thickness and general feel of my hair improved and a few areas started to burst with hair… I honestly didn’t think I would see it but there it was. Since I’m still seeing progress I decided to do another 90 days and im very hopeful that the results continue they have been in the past 3 months. I plan on updating this review at some point but I consider my first 3 months a success and recommend trying this for yourself if you are looking for something that really works.</li>
    <li> I am at my early 20&#x27;s and a candidate EE PHD student, but my hair has alrady started to fall off seriously. Did a research on the internet, and DasGro was one of the most popular fomulation. I gave it a try, and I was not disappointed. Great and Noticeable result just after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I noticed a significant reduction of hair loss when I take shower after taking the pills for only one week. Really look forwarding to the result in the near future.</li>
    <li> Well Geezo-Peetz!  What a lot of BULL S*** in these so called “REVIEWS”.  Let me tell you that ordinary people do not write flawless commentary like you see here.  Ordinary people have typo’s and grammar issues and generally write, well, like ordinary people!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my humble judgment I say that 99% of the reviews for  these hair products are written by people who are PAID  to write them.&lt;br /&gt; Not rocket science boys and girls.  Just read a few and see if they don’t all seem similar!&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I’m looking for a hair growth product – are there any “real” people out there who actually found one?</li>
    <li> I really like and trust this product because it has done so many wonderful things for my hair.  One of the disclaimers state that it blocks DHT.  Well, it&#x27;s a fact because my hair stopped falling out within days of usage and the growth is amazing.  Another disclaimer says that it repairs hair follicles.  That, too, is true. I&#x27;ve notice that my scalp is the healthiest I&#x27;ve seen in years and that&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;ve had this accelerated hair growth.  I&#x27;m a 56-year-old post-menopausal black female whose hair had been damaged over the years by perms and hair dyes.  Using this product has helped restore the youthful look and feel of my hair and scalp.  I&#x27;m glad to know that this is made in the USA but I do wish it was &amp;#34;gluten free&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m not saying that this contains gluten but since I can&#x27;t find anything about gluten on the bottle, I can only assume it does or at least traces of it.  For health reasons, my body cannot tolerate gluten.  Nevertheless, this is an excellent product if you care about your hair.</li>
    <li> I’m very impressed to see I’ve already started to lose less hair while my existing hair has become much healthier, silkier and fuller. This product definitely works!</li>
    <li> I was going bald and didn’t want to wear wigs or shave my head. I started taking DasGro Hair Formula after I heard about it from a friend. I was lucky enough to have the product show results in the first week of use. By the end of my first bottle my hair started to grow back and now being on my third I can say without a doubt this product is absolutely amazing! I have nearly all my hair back!</li>
    <li> I had a bald spot at the top of my head that slowly filled in after a few months. I couldn’t have asked for me and I now use DasGro as a preventative maintenance for hair loss. This product really works and unlike so many other things out there it will not cause side effects.</li>
    <li> I was losing hair very rapidly and was worried about going bald. As soon as I started using this product I noticed improvements. My hairfall was reduced in a matter of days and then there is the hair growth which is happening faster than I imagined. I’m very happy with this product and will surely recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> Contacted the seller and got a great response that I was going to get this for free and see what it would do to me. My new hair was grown quickly and with no struggle. Recommended for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I was offered a free sample for testing, but my opinion is unbiased.</li>
    <li> I found new hair growth on my scalp after only 3 weeks of using this product. DasGro really does grow and I’m excited for the potential this product has when used for long periods of time. I’m not saying everyone will have the same levels of success but it’s certainly worth a try if you’re losing your hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking in the mirror the other day and found new hairs growing on my hairline and other parts of my scalp. I have changed nothing in my daily routine except added DasGro Hair Formula for the last month or so. I have had no side effects and the new hair growth has given me HOPE that I can get my beautiful hair back.</li>
    <li> I needed a natural product due to health issues and was happy to find this product which I learned contains only natural ingredients. As far as results, the progress has been substantial and I can see a difference. My hair is definitely healthier and is no longer falling out in chunks.</li>
    <li> I have androgenic alopecia and nearly lost all hope until I found DasGro and noticed after 2 months that the top of my head started to grow hair! The hair growth is slow but steady, the good news is my hair isn’t falling out and the top is filling in. This is an amazing hair growth formula I just wish I knew about it sooner.</li>
    <li> Ok, it didn’t happen overnight BUT on my second bottle I began to notice a few new strands of hairs on the worst areas of my scalp and then on my third bottle it really started to FILL IN big time. I’ve had a few friends and coworkers make some positive remarks about my “new” hair. Be patient with this product and don’t give up too early. If I stopped on my first bottle I would have never got to the point where the hair started to grow.</li>
    <li> My hair appears thicker and is growing faster. No significant hair regrowth yet but it’s only been 2 weeks so I’ll have to come back and update this when I’ve had a chance to use it a few months.</li>
    <li> Just started my third bottle and ever since I began using DasGro I could tell my hair was improving especially in length and thickness. I have been getting many compliments and my stylist has commented on the hair growth too and is as impressed as I am.</li>
    <li> Used so many hair growth products and have concluded that this one is by far the best. I have been getting some amazing results and my hair growth is apparent after only a few weeks. I had a nasty bald patch that was really bothering me, this product helped my hair grow back in that area while nothing else did.</li>
    <li> Worked for me Hair is growing out thicker and longer which is exactly what I was hoping for Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> WOW! I can’t express how happy dasgro has made me. I was depressed and hopeless and thought I would lose all my hair. I started using it after a few people told me it might help and I figured I had nothing to lose. Fast forward 3 months and my hair has GROWN back about 90 percent. This has been the answer to my prayers! I’m one happy customer and I urge others to use it, it realllly works!</li>
    <li> She loves it and I can tell it has made a difference in her hair. It makes me happy to see her happy. She wanted me to write this because she doesn’t know how. THANK YOU from both of us.</li>
    <li> I only been using it for a month but it seems to be working. I&#x27;ll update in another month an write a better review</li>
    <li> It stopped my hair from falling out in less than 2 weeks. I appreciate that the product is made in the US and that it’s natural. I will continue to use it and report back on the results in a few months.</li>
    <li> GOOD STUFF! Hair is thicker, has more shine, the color has improved and it’s growing faster than ever. I love the fast hair growth, it makes my hair looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I skeptical by nature and when I decided to try this product I wasn’t expecting any marvelous results but I was a bit shocked when I started to notice new hair growth on my first month. This product has exceeded my expectations… no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this product for over a year and love it. I take a slightly lower dosage now because my hair has been doing great and I want to maintain the health. I have been encouraging others to give it a try and many of those that I know who have used it have seen great results! it’s defeinitely worth it especially when compared to the other stuff out there that does nothing.</li>
    <li> I feel like my hair has grown quite a bit since starting but I don&#x27;t know if it got any thicker! I would take it again though and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hair growth product and it really works to help hair grow back! I was a bit skeptical at first but gave it a try and shortly after starting I began to see hair growth. I love this product so much, thank you!!</li>
    <li> When it arrived I started to take it right away… 1 tablet in the morning and 1 tablet in the afternoon and on my first week I could tell it was making a difference. I just finished my first bottle and ordered a 3 month supply. This product has been working for me and I can’t wait to see what my hair will look like in a few months.</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend using dasgro for any type of hair loss. The natural ingredients have proven to be very good and my hair is thick and no longer falling out like it used to. This stuff is amazing and I’ll be getting more as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> I noticed my hair thickening after a week. Plus the vitamins give me energy. My nails are growing too. I love this product. I whighly recommend.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks I have almost no hair loss. I was shedding like crazy prior to starting this product and this has made such a big difference. My hair looks fuller and thicker! Great product.</li>
    <li> I had several bald patches that have formed over the years. I decided to try dasgro and was shocked to see how quickly I began to see progress in these areas. In just a few weeks I could tell hair was growing back in many of the patches and it has continued to fill in over the next few months. I have no experienced any side effects and I really like that it’s all natural ingredients. I am so happy to have found this product and I would strongly recommend using it for at least 3 months to really get the most out of it.</li>
    <li> I have a receding hairline that has slowly been growing back. The new hair growth started about 2 weeks into using this product. I have to say it’s not an overnight solution but given time it works very well, certainly exceeded my expectations and has given me some much needed hope that I can still get my hair back!</li>
    <li> Great hair growth product without all the nasty side effects that are common with many of the other popular hair growth products out there. It’s also very easy to add to a daily routine with only 2 tablets per day and nothing to apply to the scalp.</li>
    <li> What a great product! It has really helped me grow out my hair and stopped the excessive hair shedding. The confidence boost is a plus and my hair looks fantastic!</li>
    <li> I was afraid of going bald due to excessive shedding over recent months. I think some of it due to aging but I’ve  also been under a great deal of pressure lately. Anywho, started using and my hair has stopped falling out. It also has more shine and better color.</li>
    <li> Ok, this product is absolutely amazing! I’ve had NEW hair growth all over my scalp since I started on it. I was very skeptical to try it but I can’t deny the results I’ve been seeing. It took about 2 months to see the new hair growth but I started to see positive effects much sooner, about a week in!</li>
    <li> It has only been 10 days but already I feel my hair has grown. The texture is great, hair feels soft and looks nice.</li>
    <li> I got these for my father and he is loving the results. I was skeptical but recently saw him and his hair has definitely improved, especially the hairline area and thickness. He asked me to get him more.</li>
    <li> Great product, great ingredients, and works better than many other more expensive products.</li>
    <li> I have alopecia and tried many things until I finally found Dasgro hair formula and decided to give it a shot. Long story short I found the product to be highly effective for my alopecia and the hair growth has been amazing! It has restored my confidence. This stuff really works and I have been recommending it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great product! The results have been unreal! I started taking it and within a few days I felt a little bit of tingle on my scalp and few days later noticed hair growth around my temples and towards the front. I am very OCD about my hair loss… I pretty much count how many hairs I lose per day and since using dasgro I can tell it’s much less. This is by far the best natural hair growth solution out there and a must have for anyone with hair loss.</li>
    <li> I just started using these but have already seen some improvement in my hair. I am finding less hairs around the house and it seems to be growing out faster too.</li>
    <li> I was panicking after I noticed I was starting to lose hair.  I did as much research as possible but was still on the fence about many products.  After a short while considering my options I decided to go with this product, and I’m glad I did!  DasGrow did everything promised in the description.  I immediately noticed a huge improvement in my hair loss and my hair started to grow back.  I look better and feel great!</li>
    <li> So I was referred by my friend anna a few weeks ago. She bought her pills in January and she told me that it made her hair more rich and full and that it stopped her hairloss. Since I got mine I found out that they really do improve your hair and my hair is no longer falling out. I think ill refer some more people to this product. It does work and makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product this twice and I have noticed that my hair is no longer falling out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week. It did not upset my stomach or anything or side effects. My hair is thick and shiny.I purchased this item because I am growing out a haircut for the winter and I wanted my hair to grow quickly. As I am almost 51 years old, my hair does not grow as fast as it used to. I will update this post in a month with the final result as far as growth  but so far so good!</li>
    <li> I have been losing my hair for years and even though it&#x27;s been a slow process I just didn&#x27;t want to eventually go bald. I started using das gro because my friend suggested it after it worked for her. I couldn&#x27;t believe that it started to work after only 1 week of use and I am still seeing really good results after 1 month. What more can I say? It&#x27;s working great!!</li>
    <li> Been using it 2 weeks and hair has already showed some progression in thickness, texture and length. Great product and I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Great vitamin source but has done nothing to strengthen my hair</li>
    <li> Worth it! It’s great for stopping hair loss and helping with hair regrowth. I just ordered more, thank you.</li>
    <li> My hair started to grow after 2 weeks and it’s still going even after I have completed my three months and have stopped using it. I will order more because I don’t want to risk any reversal but this is great!!</li>
    <li> Alopecia runs in my family and has been an ongoing problem for many years. I started on the dasgro hair formula program and in 4 months I reversed years of hair loss. My family is shocked at just how amazing the progress has been. I’m not saying it works overnight or anything but I found the longer I used it the more hair growth I noticed.</li>
    <li> Wow, I’m very impressed at how quickly this product was able to stop my hair loss! I just started but this is great so far!</li>
    <li> This is a great natural formula that has helped my hair quite a bit. Less hair loss and more hair growth and zero side effects.</li>
    <li> I have been using DasGro for 2 months and purchased it because I was losing hair. At around 3 weeks I noticed that my excessive shedding completely stopped. I had been getting at least a handful of hair when I showered and then shedding profusely throughout the day. Now, when I shower, I maybe have 5 strands that come out and don&#x27;t shed at all throughout the day. I can already see new growth coming in but I expect not to see full results until about the 6 month mark. However, there is no doubt that it works and I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I take one tablet in the morning and one in the afternoon and have been experiencing amazing results in new hair growth AND reduced hair loss. I would definitely recommend this to others IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for about a month have not notice much difference. I have some thinning at crown of my head since I been taking these pills it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s doing anything. I purchased another month supply just to see if it will help..</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks of this product, I&#x27;m seeing some good growth now. My hair is started to grow on the top of my forehead, I was actually planning on getting hair transplant but this product was obviously the better option and works.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this by my friend. I&#x27;ve been seeing a ton of my hair on the shower drain and it&#x27;s been falling off way too much. These pills have worked well and it&#x27;s replenishing a lot of good nutrients to my hair.</li>
    <li> I had a reaction to one of the ingredients in it</li>
    <li> This product has given me amazing hair growth results in less than 30 days. I was a tad bit skeptical but after trying it I can say that it really does work. My scalp is getting a ton of new hair that weren’t there before and I couldn’t be happier.</li>
    <li> I find this product has the perfect balance of important ingredients. I find that 4,000mcg of biotin is perfect for me. I used to take more and it would make me sick but this is perfect. The rest of the ingredients are great and I have nothing but positive things to say. I’ve had zero ill effects and my hair is growing and healthy.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 months worth of this stuff. It&#x27;s obviously not going to help anyone. Your pee will be bright yellow and honestly you might be getting an overdose of your daily vitamins. THis is basically a multivitamin aimed at people that are upset and experiencing hair loss for the first time and desperate to reverse it. If you need vitamins get a one a day and some biotin that is all this product is. They put labels next to the bottle so you think it&#x27;s legit... Wow they follow regulations, If you are desperate to fix your hair get FUE or get a concealer this stuff is not going to cure your thinning hair. Thats genetics and its part of aging.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair growth product out there! Ever since I started using it my hair has been growing, even the areas that have long been dormant. It’s been a miracle for me and has turned me into a believer. I am a customer for life.</li>
    <li> Still not sure if it&#x27;s working as great as the other reviews posted.. Will not buy again going to try something else...</li>
