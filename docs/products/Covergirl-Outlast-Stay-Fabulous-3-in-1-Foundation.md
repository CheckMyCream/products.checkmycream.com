      <li>Good foundation.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this foundation!</li>
      <li>Nice coverage</li>
      <li>After so many good reviews, I thought I had found the holy grail of foundations.  </li>
      <li>It is indeed a nice foundation</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t love this more!  </li>
      <li>I have always been a fan of covergirl products and I was extremely excited to try this foundation after reading so many great reviews.  </li>
      <li>Love this, and will buy it again.</li>
      <li>My favorite foundation.. ordered more than once already</li>
      <li>and then you can go again and apply more if you need/want it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another thing I like is that there are many more shade options available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My favorite foundation.  </li>
      <li>I only wear a heavier make up when I want to look flawless.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a good foundation IF you find your right color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This new product sounded great because of the added sunscreen and primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For what i&#x27;ve tried so far not that great</li>
      <li>/&gt;It applies easily and stays on for about 4-6 hours.</li>
      <li>It washes off easily too.</li>
      <li>I am happy to report that this product not only does not irritate my skin</li>
      <li>but i got a shade a bit too light for me</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t look like I have makeup on.</li>
      <li>Then recently I discovered this foundation (I think it is a very new product) and I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I think this is a very good product  overall and very affordable.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>The ONLY pro that I found is that it did feel nice on my skin, not greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and application is very easy.</li>
      <li>The color is true to the picture and the quantity is a decent size.</li>
      <li>I have a combination  skin and this held pretty well around the T-Zone.  </li>
      <li>I never even left my house in it or kept it on for more than an hour.</li>
      <li>(HOLDS PRETTY WELL)</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend this if you wear tinted moisturizer but want more coverage.</li>
      <li>I think this a really good foundation if you are looking for something very wearable, everyday basis.</li>
      <li>It gives medium coverage right away, I apply it with my real techniques face brush, but it&#x27;s very buildable...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Inexpensive product which offers a full coverage.</li>
      <li>and I never thought I&#x27;d find something equally good if not better.</li>
      <li>It immediately settled into every nook and cranny in my face and stuck to every even slightly dry spot on my face, making all my flaws even more noticeable.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very lighter for me</li>
      <li>I have to say that I was really impress,I put the foundation about 8:00 am</li>
      <li>But I really like it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used primer before and the results were much different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but not least, the price is unbeatable!  </li>
      <li>I have fair combination skin with moderate hyper pigmentation and slight pocking from old acne.</li>
      <li>I bought this wanting to try something new.  </li>
      <li>the product is ok but the color is totally not what i expected.  </li>
      <li>This foundation got stuck in my sebaceous filaments, fine hairs, and any tiny patch of dry skin.  </li>
      <li>and so far I have had no problems.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so im gonna try and buy a darker shade and see how that works out, but might just end up going to my old foundation</li>
      <li>recommend this product for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>After many years of wearing Max Factor Lasting Performance - which disappeared a few years ago-</li>
      <li>That is not to say that you don&#x27;t have to be careful when applying this foundation, but it is much easier to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Considering: I really dont have any sever skin issues, like dark spots or scars.</li>
      <li>Now I can wash my face and reapply without hurting a little bit about how much longer my bottle will last.  </li>

<li> ordered wrong shade due to color chart not going from light to dark in order</li>
<li> suffer from rosacea with sometimes severe flare-ups and have trouble finding products with enough coverage that will not irritate my skin.  </li>
<li> I recently made the mistake of trying out a different foundation because it was less expensive &amp; it just solidified the fact that Covergirl 3-in-1 is the only one I want to use from now on.</li>
<li> and they both oxidize to a dark color.</li>
<li> only down side is it did come broken, I can still use it</li>
<li> I just get a few pimples when im around my period, and of course my undereye circles.</li>
<li> It was too heavy and stayed in my wrinkle and creases.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not quite that pale</li>
<li> Im fairly pale and</li>
<li> My usual foundation is Cover Girl Tru Blends.  </li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t like drugstore makeup  </li>
<li> Instead of gliding on it feels a bit thick.  </li>
<li> Terrible if u live in a dry climate</li>
<li> I cannot comment on the lasting power, as it looked so bad</li>
<li> I was unable to find a matte foundation that lasted all day.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve now tried this product at least three times now and am disappointed in the results.  </li>
<li> I am so disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product did not work for me. It was too heavy and stayed in my wrinkle and creases.</li>
    <li> the product is ok but the color is totally not what i expected.  so it will be passed on after  not even wearing it</li>
    <li> Great for evenings out for events. I only wear a heavier make up when I want to look flawless.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely a good foundation IF you find your right color.&lt;br /&gt;I already bought 2 and they both oxidize to a dark color. They match me at first&lt;br /&gt;but after a while they become darker and darker. It is indeed a nice foundation&lt;br /&gt;but the oxidation throws me off.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this foundation! It lasts all day, making the rest of my makeup last all day, too! I recently made the mistake of trying out a different foundation because it was less expensive &amp; it just solidified the fact that Covergirl 3-in-1 is the only one I want to use from now on.</li>
    <li> For the pal gal and I&#x27;m not quite that pale</li>
    <li> For what i&#x27;ve tried so far not that great but i got a shade a bit too light for me so im gonna try and buy a darker shade and see how that works out, but might just end up going to my old foundation</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very lighter for me</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of covergirl products and I was extremely excited to try this foundation after reading so many great reviews.  This foundation did NOT work for me.  I have fair combination skin with moderate hyper pigmentation and slight pocking from old acne. The foundation set so quickly that I found it almost impossible to blend (I tried first with my fingers and a second time with a foundation brush.) It immediately settled into every nook and cranny in my face and stuck to every even slightly dry spot on my face, making all my flaws even more noticeable.  It also did nothing to cover redness and blemishes.  I tried a third time with a moisturizer/ primer underneath as some others suggested and it did not help at all. I cannot comment on the lasting power, as it looked so bad I never even left my house in it or kept it on for more than an hour. I am so disappointed. After so many good reviews, I thought I had found the holy grail of foundations.  If I could give this product 0 stars, I would.  The ONLY pro that I found is that it did feel nice on my skin, not greasy at all.  I will be returning this A.S.A.P.</li>
    <li> My favorite foundation.. ordered more than once already</li>
    <li> Terrible if u live in a dry climate but it has great coverage</li>
    <li> ordered wrong shade due to color chart not going from light to dark in order</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revlon ColorStay Liquid Foundation for years and I never thought I&#x27;d find something equally good if not better. And the best part is it&#x27;s from the drugstore woohoo! The color nude beige matches my skin tone perfectly. I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and application is very easy. It doesn&#x27;t feel cakey at all. At the end of the day, my makeup still looks great provided that I set it with powder. I don&#x27;t have to use a face primer because this foundation lasts a long time. I&#x27;m so happy I gave this one a shot.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t love this more!  After many years of wearing Max Factor Lasting Performance - which disappeared a few years ago- I was unable to find a matte foundation that lasted all day.  It stays perfect, even in Florida humidity!  Never gets shiny, it is a perfect match to my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Good foundation. Nice coverage and it&#x27;s not greasy.  Love this, and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The color is true to the picture and the quantity is a decent size. If you are a regular once-daily user you may have to replace every 1-1.5 months depending on the size of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It applies easily and stays on for about 4-6 hours. It washes off easily too. I use coconut oil to get it off and so far I have had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive product which offers a full coverage.</li>
    <li> I bought this wanting to try something new.  My usual foundation is Cover Girl Tru Blends.  This new product sounded great because of the added sunscreen and primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now tried this product at least three times now and am disappointed in the results.  Instead of gliding on it feels a bit thick.  The primer does not function at all.  This foundation got stuck in my sebaceous filaments, fine hairs, and any tiny patch of dry skin.  I&#x27;ve used primer before and the results were much different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I think I&#x27;ll just stick to using a separate primer and foundation.  I would not order this product again.</li>
    <li> For years I have been using two foundations from another maker which are $50+ apiece.  Then recently I discovered this foundation (I think it is a very new product) and I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from rosacea with sometimes severe flare-ups and have trouble finding products with enough coverage that will not irritate my skin.  I am happy to report that this product not only does not irritate my skin but it makes it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is not as total as with the other product I was using, which in a way I prefer because with the other product I had to be extra careful or I would end up looking like a Kabuki actress or a geisha.  That is not to say that you don&#x27;t have to be careful when applying this foundation, but it is much easier to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like is that there are many more shade options available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, the price is unbeatable!  Now I can wash my face and reapply without hurting a little bit about how much longer my bottle will last.  In these dog days of summer I appreciate this fact a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for people with sensitive skin.  It might not work as individual skins react differently but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> (HOLDS PRETTY WELL) There has been a lot of fuss over this product  and I figured I will give it a try. I usually don&#x27;t like drugstore makeup  but I thought it was only a couple bucks so why not try it. I have to say that I was really impress,I put the foundation about 8:00 am and it lasted all the long  until I got home at 7:00 pm. I have a combination  skin and this held pretty well around the T-Zone.  I think this is a very good product  overall and very affordable.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t look like I have makeup on. I use this with a tiny bit of lotion in the morning and it seems to last all day. Definitely recommend this if you wear tinted moisturizer but want more coverage.</li>
    <li> My favorite foundation.  Doesnt break me out, doesnt clog pours. Im fairly pale and nude beige is my color. It looks flawless. only down side is it did come broken, I can still use it but I have to unscrew it</li>
    <li> The best fundation ever!</li>
    <li> I think this a really good foundation if you are looking for something very wearable, everyday basis. It gives medium coverage right away, I apply it with my real techniques face brush, but it&#x27;s very buildable... because it&#x27;s liquid enough that you can play around a bit before it totally sets and then you can go again and apply more if you need/want it. So I dont agree that it has &amp;#34;the coverage of a concealer&amp;#34; because it doesnt, I have darkness under my eyes and this alone doesnt do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But oh my gosh. The feeling that you get in your skin is a powdery-velvety one, I dont know quite how to put my finger on it. But I really like it, my skin looks matte but it still has some luminescence after NOT an oily finish. And it does last through the day just as if you would have used a primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it! Considering: I really dont have any sever skin issues, like dark spots or scars. I just get a few pimples when im around my period, and of course my undereye circles. My skin type is combo (Somewhat oily on my T-zone and dry (really dry sometimes) on my cheeks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have found that the foundation does cling on my dry patches so that makes me think that this isnt for someone with purely dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is my go to foundation.  It has a primer, BB. and foundation.  It provides excellent coverage and lasts all day.  Looks great and a good price point.  Check it out!!!</li>
