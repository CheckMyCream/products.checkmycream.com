      <li>I get many compliments on it.</li>
      <li>sure,</li>
      <li>I love Clinque; have used it for years but always purchased at Macy&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I have been using Aromatics for more than 30 years.  </li>
      <li>I love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>Love this scent.</li>
      <li>Wonder why this is, but still love the scent.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>LOVE this perfume.</li>
      <li>This is my mothers favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>The price was good compared to local department stores, but when it arrived, a goodly portioned had leaked out into the box.  </li>
      <li>but no one says anything at all with this bottle...smells good when applying but seems to disappear fast.</li>
      <li>Love clean smell that lasts</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to say after running out of perfume...and not receiving any for Christmas, I decided to treat myself and am happy to say I have my old-stand by back.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean yet kinda sexy.  </li>
      <li>So overpowering and strong it will knock you over.</li>
      <li>So light, clean and refreshing...</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>Fantastic fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I love it because it lasts all day, which is unusual for most fragrances.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works with each person&#x27;s chemistry to make it smell unique to you.&lt;br /&gt;People</li>
      <li>It smells a bit strong when you first spray it on, so hold it at a distance and go lightly.</li>
      <li>Nothing light and fresh about this scent.</li>
      <li>now I have come back to it &amp; recall how utterly gorgeous it is.</li>
      <li>Consider one of Clinique&#x27;s more modern scents instead.</li>
      <li>Has always been my favorite perfume...still love it the best, but it does not seem to last like it did in years past.</li>
      <li>My coworkers know when I&#x27;m in the lab from the lingering scent... NOT an overbearing, obnoxious, flowery, citrus type aroma, but rather a pleasant overall fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>Has a clean, fresh smell.  </li>
      <li>It has a similar resinous warm quality, although of course not the depth and layers  of the Baccarat scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells so fresh and not over-powering.  </li>
      <li>PUTTING A SMILE ON HER FACE</li>
      <li>(The first bottle that I ordered came with a defective sprayer, however AMAZON was quick to rectify the situation.)</li>
      <li>One must use this sparingly as it is powerful &amp; very seductive in just one spritz!</li>
      <li>Years ago, only quality scents were available in fine department stores.</li>
      <li>I think this not original, the same brand which I experience from Macy&#x27;s was excellent and the fragrance lasted for 2,3 days.</li>
      <li>Came quick and packed very well.  </li>
      <li>Product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>but this one, everyone seems to love it who gets close enough to me to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very unique and stays on for a long time.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Aromatics Elixir is resinous, spicy, and warm, slightly unisex.</li>
      <li>THIS YEARS AGO WAS TO MUCH MONEY FOR HER</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I get comments from people all the time as to what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing as they like it so much.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t need much on...</li>
      <li>I have loved this fragrance since the late 1980&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I have tried other brands, but most are too floral for me.  </li>
      <li>There used to be a older women who worked with us and her perfume knocked everyone out when she passed by and that is what this reminds me of.  </li>
      <li>I personally can&#x27;t stand the generic &#x27;&#x27;detergent aisle&#x27;&#x27; scent of most mainstream marketed perfumes and colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a classic.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this...scent stays with you all day...don&#x27;t need much on...</li>
    <li> No problems with quality or speed of delivery. Very satisfied !</li>
    <li> I have also worn this for years and dont plan to switch to another one.  although I can hardly smell it myself anymore - I have been asked many times:  what are you wearing ? it smells great..</li>
    <li> I started wearing Aromatics Elixer when I was in my 20&#x27;s. I always loved to dress well and loved high quality scents. This is one of the best scents made. For those nay sayers that think it is for little old ladies, it may be that the glut of cheap, celebrity line, all smell the same crap perfumes have made it impossible for them to recognize quality scents. Years ago, only quality scents were available in fine department stores. Now cheap crap is so available, no one knows a quality product and refined scent when they smell it.&lt;br /&gt;I am far from a little old lady and have loved this since I was in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Worn this scent for years...now I have come back to it &amp; recall how utterly gorgeous it is. One must use this sparingly as it is powerful &amp; very seductive in just one spritz!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I think this not original, the same brand which I experience from Macy&#x27;s was excellent and the fragrance lasted for 2,3 days. Now this one isn&#x27;t lasts few hours. I am not satisfied with this.</li>
    <li> Love clean smell that lasts</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent for years.  I get many compliments on it. It is just right--not too heavy, not too light.</li>
    <li> Has always been my favorite perfume...still love it the best, but it does not seem to last like it did in years past. Wonder why this is, but still love the scent.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  I have tried other brands, but most are too floral for me.  Aromatics is perfect.  Hope they never discontinue it.</li>
    <li> Love this usually, but this appeared to be an old bottle and smelled.</li>
    <li> I have loved this fragrance since the late 1980&#x27;s. For years I couldn&#x27;t find it and I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this scent for years.  It is very unique and stays on for a long time.  I love it!  I get comments from people all the time as to what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing as they like it so much.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe all the great reviews this has gotten.  I was so eager to try it.  I received it today and just used a small spritz and I am just overcome with the scent.  It is so strong, even with such a small amount.  I think I will be bowling people over if I wear this.  There used to be a older women who worked with us and her perfume knocked everyone out when she passed by and that is what this reminds me of.  Not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  It&#x27;s clean yet kinda sexy.  I have used it for 20+ years (I&#x27;m 62 y.o.).  This is a classic.  Love it!</li>
    <li> BOYFRIEND AND I GOT FOR MY MOTHER SHE USE TO USE THIS YEARS AGO WAS TO MUCH MONEY FOR HER BUT NOW SHE GOTS IT AND THAT IS ALL THT MATTERS TO ME PUTTING A SMILE ON HER FACE ANYTHING SHE WANT SHE GETS CAUSE SHES A PIECE OF MY HEART</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for many years.  The order I just received was disappointing because the actual liquid is dark and old looking.  It also smells stronger than past bottles I have used.  I am convinced it is old and has been on some shelf for way too long.  Unfortunately, it is non-returnable!  Be sure and note that before you order it!!</li>
    <li> My husband bought me the 1st bottle, Christmas 1981 - it is my only perfume from then on - I get so many compliments on it!</li>
    <li> This is an old-time favorite of mine that I had stopped using years ago because I just couldn&#x27;t smell it.  I started wearing it again; and everyone else loves it -- which is great -- but again, I cannot smell anything on me.  Maybe the key is to switch off with another scent occasionally;nor sure, but Aromatics is a beautiful and reasonably priced fragrance, and it was delivered on time by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I received this perfume about 30 years ago as a gift and it was the only perfume I used.  But, I began to receive other perfumes as gifts and hadn&#x27;t replenished my supply.  I&#x27;m glad to say after running out of perfume...and not receiving any for Christmas, I decided to treat myself and am happy to say I have my old-stand by back. Love this scent.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I wanted.Received perfume in earlier than expected time even though it was the Christmas season.My favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> This is my mothers favorite perfume. Hands down this needs to be worn by all women who have allergies. The smell is unique and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Smells like old lady perfume! So overpowering and strong it will knock you over. Nothing light and fresh about this scent. Consider one of Clinique&#x27;s more modern scents instead.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. I get comments from people on great i smell when I wear it and they ask what I am wearing. I couldn&#x27;t believe that I found it, after all this years because I used to wear it back when Clinique put it out on the market. I love the it!!!</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and in good order.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aromatics for more than 30 years.  I love, love, love it.  It suits me now in my 70&#x27;s as well as it dd in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Who would imagine this unassuming fragrance that has been around for so long, that as a self professed fragrance snob I passed over because I thought it had to be too ordinary, would turn out to be my recent favorite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many years I have only bought and enjoyed high end and &#x27;&#x27;niche&#x27;&#x27; , hard to find fragrances, being drawn to complex fragrances that are so yummy you can&#x27;t stop sniffing yourself. I personally can&#x27;t stand the generic &#x27;&#x27;detergent aisle&#x27;&#x27; scent of most mainstream marketed perfumes and colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent this very slightly reminds me of (that is out of reach for me price wise at this time at $6800 per ounce) is Baccarat&#x27;s Les Larmes Sacrees de Thebes (The Sacred Tears of Thebes), that I had the good fortune to get a small decant of some years back. It has a similar resinous warm quality, although of course not the depth and layers  of the Baccarat scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aromatics Elixir is resinous, spicy, and warm, slightly unisex. It smells a bit strong when you first spray it on, so hold it at a distance and go lightly. Everything smells differently on everyone, and one never knows how something will meld with one&#x27;s body chemistry, and I think this particularly is different on everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the scents I loved wearing that I thought smelled great I would never get compliments on..but this one, everyone seems to love it who gets close enough to me to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I like layering it with Origen&#x27;s Ginger souffle body lotion -- absolutely delicious!).</li>
    <li> Long lasting fragrance</li>
    <li> Love this perfume been using it for many years. Came quick and packed very well.  Paid about the same price I always pay.</li>
    <li> very very nice fragrance I use since 1978 and I love it, I recommend this fragrance to all ages  wear in the evening, I received a lot&amp;#34;s compliment&amp;#34;s always I will use!!</li>
    <li> My mothers favorite.  Arrived ahead of time.  No damage to box or bottle.  EDP spray is a bit stronger then the TS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray for many years. I love it because it lasts all day, which is unusual for most fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a year round scent and not too heavy.</li>
    <li> LOVE this perfume. Get lots of compliments of scent. Last the entire day. Another good clinique scent is WRAPPINGS!</li>
    <li> Excellent &amp;iacute;tem</li>
    <li> I like this product but the bottle leaks.  This is a very expensive product and this is the second time this has happen to me.  Is there any way Aronomatics Elixir by Clinic can replace the bottle that I have.  It leaks after I spray the product on!  Please let me know</li>
    <li> I have worn this for 10 years+. My favorite and a little lasts a long time.  The price was excellant.</li>
    <li> Smelling Good!  Has a clean, fresh smell.  Don&#x27;t have to take my big bottle when I travel.</li>
    <li> The perfect fragrance for a working environment.  Good value and size of bottle. Will order again in time when needed.</li>
    <li> What can I say, the service is great and I love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my sister for Christmas.  The price was good compared to local department stores, but when it arrived, a goodly portioned had leaked out into the box.  Not such a good value when 1/4 of it is already gone :(</li>
    <li> The smell is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for! I&#x27;ve received many compliments on the smell.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance. I&#x27;ve been out of it for a while. I&#x27;m use to the sent lasting all day long this one don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased that I can now buy this &amp;#34;Clinique&amp;#34; perfume via Amazon.  I only need to use a little which goes a long way.  Thanks Amazon for making my life a little easier.</li>

    <li> I love Clinque; have used it for years but always purchased at Macy&#x27;s and I used to always get compliments on my aroma but no one says anything at all with this bottle...smells good when applying but seems to disappear fast.</li>
    <li> Fantastic fragrance.  Love it.  Thank you.  The price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I adore this scent.  So light, clean and refreshing... but warning -- a little goes a LONG way!  I receive compliments ALL of the time when wearing it.  My coworkers know when I&#x27;m in the lab from the lingering scent... NOT an overbearing, obnoxious, flowery, citrus type aroma, but rather a pleasant overall fresh scent.  (The first bottle that I ordered came with a defective sprayer, however AMAZON was quick to rectify the situation.)</li>
    <li> Love it!  My signature fragrance for years.. shipped promptly, good price.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite perfume.  It smells so fresh and not over-powering.  It works with each person&#x27;s chemistry to make it smell unique to you.&lt;br /&gt;People always ask me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great scent and have been using this scent for years, its neither feminine or masculine but great for either sex to wear.</li>
