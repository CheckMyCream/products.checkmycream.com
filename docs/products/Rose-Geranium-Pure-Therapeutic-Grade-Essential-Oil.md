      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Rose Geranium oil.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t give the rose geranium all the credit</li>

      <li>i used it on my dogs just to let them smell nice.</li>

      <li>My wife heard that rose</li>
      <li>added advantage to the Rose Geranium ...</li>
      <li>It has a very potent (lovely) smell that is not agreeable to some people.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>This stuff has a strong smell!</li>
      <li>When the oil is received, most companies (including &amp;^%&amp;^%$, %^$^*^ and Edens Garden) will conduct their own testing to determine if the quality meets their standards.&amp;#34; There was more to the letter, but suffice it to say...</li>

      <li>Repels most insects including ticks and mosquitoes.</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite oil</li>
      <li>More than one drop (shared among all of the spots I dab it on) will be overpowering</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good oil. However it was my intent to use in a beard oil and it is a bit strong</li>
    <li> Rose oil is great but pretty expensive.  Wait for some sale</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Smells weird but works</li>
    <li> I bought this oil for tick repellent, found a tick in my dog right were I put the oil-was shocked!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use as tick repellent for my dogs.  First time trying it and it actually works very well.  The beautiful scent is a bonus.  I will definitely continue to use this essential oil.</li>
    <li> It dies work well but must remember to apt daily during tic feast seasons.  Great alternative to applying FL onto a dogs back.  Safer 😃</li>
    <li> I use this oil as a perfume since my skin is sensitive...love it! :)</li>
    <li> Simply Amazing.  I have mature dry skin that lacks well toned natural color.  It just looks shallow - and trust me - I have purchased some of the finest European skin care products - but I&#x27;m unable to financially maintain the upkeep.  I first purchased this oil because I embraced and greeted a woman and instantly I felt calm and peace in her presence.  Since then I was on a quest.  Not only is this fragrance smoothing and calming, it&#x27;s simply amazing on my skin.  My face hasn&#x27;t glowed and has been tightened in years - day in day out for the entire day.  My face is soft, dewy, has depth and just all around looks satin healthy.  I now blend this with a carrier oil -RoseHip Oil - and WOW - instantly absorbs without ZERO residue or trace of oil.  PLEASE read about this art of essential oils and experience genuine health from within - healthy and natural.  I own about 9 oils - and just enjoy creating all types of mixes.  Rose Geranium and Lavendar combined are simply divine and wonderfully drifts me off to a very deep sleep.</li>
    <li> I got this to keep the fleas and ticks off of my outside cat, although he doesn&#x27;t like it I think is smells pretty .....</li>
    <li> Great oil. Lots of uses including tick repellent for humans and dogs.</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> We use this daily on our dogs during the winter for tick prevention. Works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased Edens Garden Rose Geranium for the purpose of tick repellent for my dog. I am happy to say that it works for this intended purpose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a wooded rural area and my hound dog runs the woods and thickets on our daily walks. After each walk it was not unusual to find several ticks on my dog and even a couple on me. I now put a drop of this Rose Geranium on the back of my neck at the hairline and a drop between the dog&#x27;s shoulder blades and a drop at the base of his tail--daily! No more ticks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that I live in north Florida and we often have a few days in a row of rain I would sometimes not administer the essential oil treatment, thinking it might be washed away and wasted. When I did this, I would find ticks on us again. So now I do this every day without fail and we are not seeing the ticks at all anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added advantage to the Rose Geranium ... My dog and I smell sweet as roses!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> It did not repel ticks---after using it as directed, my dog had seven ticks on him. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to add fragrance to my hair and body concoctions, and it smells amazing. Only one or two drops of it would be enough; it&#x27;s really strong!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I read elsewhere that it kept ticks away- both on animals and humans. We&#x27;ve been clearing out in the woods and I don&#x27;t like to spray chemicals all over us. I put it on my ankles, behind my knees, around my wrists and on the back of my neck. I must&#x27;ve brushed by a patch of seed/nymph ticks mid shin because I had several crawling up my leg. Also, biting flies seemed to be attracted to this stuff because they would&#x27;nt leave me alone while others were not bothered by them. If I tried this again for ticks, I would probably mix it with something else and put it in a spray bottle and spray all over. Other than that, it seems to be very high quality oil and smells very floral.</li>
    <li> Good delivery, good product, very happy</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my dogs as a tick repellant. I have two corgis that I have shaved for the summer so they don&#x27;t have the long hair. They go running in the pasture with me and pick up ticks. I have used this product twice on both dogs. I put a drop on the neck and above the tail. This stuff has a strong smell! It&#x27;s smell awful to me and makes by dogs smell awful! Both times I used it my dogs still picked up ticks. One dog even had a tick latched on close to where the oil was.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use as a more natural deterrent for ticks. So far so good...</li>
    <li> Would have to have a gallon for it to work.</li>
    <li> Stinky and did not work for stopping ticks on my dog.</li>
    <li> It works like it should.</li>
    <li> nothing wrong with product as sent by seller but I bought this produce to repel ticks and it didn&#x27;t work.Buy it for it&#x27;s intended use and not for ticks</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Rose Geranium oil, and also with the prompt delivery. thank you.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Now everyone have a great day!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I think the product is OK but the bottle didn&#x27;t dispense properly. I had to poke a hole in the dispenser to get any out. Doesn&#x27;t come out a drop at a time like other essential oil products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> love this product! I keep it by the door and put 3 drops down my dog&#x27;s spine (from neck to base of tail) before heading out for walks/hikes. Keeps ticks/fleas off him like a charm. Forgot it on a trip to Savannah and bought some random other brand at a natural store--did not work as well as this brand. This one is much more concentrated than the other brand I purchased that time.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Very strong scent.</li>
    <li> So first day out of the gate I used this on my dogs shoulder blades and base of tail.  30 minute walk along the edge of a field and one ended up with 3 ticks in her ears. I am not sure if they didnt want to travel past the oil area or it was a coincidence. I may try a drop on her head and see. i havent given up yet.</li>
    <li> Thanks, just what I needed</li>
    <li> These definitely are not as high quality as YL but I thought I would try them (bought tea tree oil, geranium, and ylang ylang) for the price. If you just want to diffuse them for the smell they will do.</li>
    <li> SUFFERING FROM SHINGLES? This oil is helping with the pain. . The redness and swelling are disappearing. Use every 4 hours. Until healed</li>
    <li> Worked well with both of my pups for fleas</li>
    <li> Works great to ward off those nasty bugs!</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but smells good.</li>
    <li> The scent is strong, but that was to be expected.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This brand has very good quality oils. I made a mistake in ordering the rose Geranium, I meant to get the other type of Geranium, but this was a really good purchase.</li>
    <li> This is good if you want to smell nice and use it as a perfume. It is definitely affordable. I need therapeutic grade oils and comparing this with another brand I have been using, I don&#x27;t think this is truly therapeutic - it is a weaker grade. The other brand I use gives quick results</li>
    <li> This works awesome, I have not seen a tick on my dogs since I have been using it, and to not have chemicals on my dog or hanging around their necks is a huge piece of mind.</li>
    <li> very strong smell.  think i&#x27;m allergic to roses, every time I use the oil, my skin itches.  I use very little &amp; the smell is over bearing.  Won&#x27;t use it on my skin anymore.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> i bought it for ticks repellent but it did not work out.&lt;br /&gt;so i used it on my dogs just to let them smell nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I was given advice to apply it to my dog to avoid ticks. I have to say it did its job. Have not had a problem with a single one since using this! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a natural tick repellent for myself!! And it works!! I put a drop inside each wrist, behind each knee, and on each ankle and haven&#x27;t had any issues! I still wear long pants as I normally would! Also read it can be used for dogs too!! Not cats! Do not use it on cats- they cannot metabolize it. For dogs-- just put one drop on back of neck, and on area above tail on back. Good luck!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;tick repellent&amp;#34; effect we were hoping for but everyone says we smell GREAT!</li>
    <li> Great product! Excellent and fast service :)</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a review on natural tick repellant for dogs.  We live in the woods, and one of our dogs was picking up two or more ticks every day.  After applying the oil at the neck and tail base daily, we did not see the ticks.  It is hard for me to be 100% conclusive, because our dogs did begin an oral flea treatment soon after.  Also, if you are sensitive to strong smells, this may not be the product for you. All in all, if you are looking for a natural and inexpensive tick repellant option, check this out.  It is way less expensive than a prescription.</li>
    <li> Very effective for keeping ticks off my dog.</li>
    <li> THIS ONE SMELLS REALLY STRONG JUST A LITTLE BIT GOES A LONG WAY. IF YOU LIKE A STRONG SCENT YOU WILL LOVE IT I LOVE MORE SOFT FRUITY SCENTS.</li>
    <li> I like Edens Garden essential oil so much that I ordered more ( from Amazon, of course). The quality seems to be excellent and the reviews were very good. They have very reasonable prices, also.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> I still find a few ticks on my German Shepherds.</li>
    <li> This really works... One drop on each shoulder blade and one drop on the dock of his tail..&lt;br /&gt;and NO more ticks...&lt;br /&gt;And smells so Yummy!!</li>
    <li> We use it as a tick repellent for our coonhound. Must buy the 100% pure therapeutic grade for it to be beneficial in repelling them - this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I got this because i read an article that this is good for ticket/flea repelant for dogs.  I put it on my dog and couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of it and had to give him a bath because I got a migraine from the scent.  The vendor was wonderful and I would buy from them again.  I am just not sure what I was thinking since it does say rose geranium....not like I didn&#x27;t know it when I was making the purchase.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Have not seen any ticks since we started using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I read that others have used it to keep ticks off their body. I use it when I am trimming bushes or working in areas of the property where I am going to be in taller grasses or under trees. Since I have been using it, I haven&#x27;t had any bugs on me, at all, when I have been working outside.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing as a tick preventative. I can only conclude that it&#x27;s very nice as a smell, yet nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;It would seem all the 5 star reviewers see maybe one tick a year. We have what must be literally thousands.&lt;br /&gt;Went to the vet and got Bravecto. Dead ticks every time.</li>
    <li> I got this oil after seeing it recommended for repelling ticks.  So far, so good! We&#x27;ve been using it for a month, in the height of summer in a heavily forested tick wonderland, and we&#x27;ve all been tick-free, even the cat! Plus we smell wonderful.  :-)  The only reason I took a star off is the bottle.  I got the 5ml size, and the &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34; insert doesn&#x27;t work very well.  It&#x27;s not an evedropper lid like I was expecting.  Rather, its more of a very small pouring spout. Fine if you&#x27;re adding oils to some concoction, but not very helpful if you&#x27;re just trying to get one drop on a squirmy child or pet. Even when I&#x27;m putting it on myself - not squirming - it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess if nothing or several drops will come out.  I&#x27;ve taken to using it like a perfume bottle (press to skin, shake gently) but I&#x27;d much prefer an actual eyedropper cap.</li>
    <li> I buy this to keep ticks off my dog and it works very well in tick season. The only time she gets ticks on her when we go for a walk is when i forget to put it on her.  I used this on my neck one afternoon as I was being harassed by a mosquito, and it did not bother me anymore</li>
    <li> Im not sure if it worked for tick control but a very small amount leaked out in my suitcase and it actually scented it very nicely. It was light and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I bought them to fight ticks in New England area. It works as I found on websites. And it smells good.</li>
    <li> Got it to fend of flies, mosquitos, ticks, fleas off my dog and me! It works!!</li>
    <li> Oil seems to work well keeping fleas/ticks off our huskies during their walks in the woods.  It has the added benefit of making them smell nice too.  Only problem we have is with the bottle.  Makes it difficult to get a drop or two out to use on the dogs.  Doesn&#x27;t take much oil to do the job, so that is apparently by design.</li>
    <li> We take our dogs to the lake every weekend and I bought this to help repel ticks.....It DID NOT work at ALL!  I still had to pick 10-15 ticks off my dogs every day.  DO NOT RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> Great product and worked well on girl scout project outside.  I did find a health store that sells similar product, but could not find this oil in particular full strength.  thank you and price was reasonable</li>
    <li> Bought this after doing some research for holistic flea and tick control for my dog.  IT WORKS GREAT !  We use it on ourselves as well.  You can find the &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; online.</li>
    <li> My wife heard that rose geranium oil keeps ticks away.  When we plan on being outside for a while we add a drop to our ankles/shoes and rub it around.  We also add a couple drops to our dogs between the shoulder blades and near the tail.  Seems to work great!</li>
    <li> did not keep ticks off as advertised</li>
    <li> I also find relief for leg neuropathy each evening.  I first use coconut or argan oil, then rub on a few drops of rose geranium and within 15 minutes my feet and leg discomfort eases.</li>
    <li> I like the scent but it was a little strong. I still will include it in my recipes. Still something i will buy again.</li>
    <li> Lovevthis oil. I added it to my coconut oil bug bath to keep the ticks and bugs away. With all kinds of additions. It works and it has also cleared the skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Keeps the ticks away from us and pets ...without the nasty chemicals.</li>
    <li> Gave it a 4 star simply because the bottle was so small, and didn&#x27;t even last me a week on vacation. But as far as a all natural tick repellant, I give it a 5 star*****. In fact there weren&#x27;t any bugs or mosquitoes that bothered my dogs. Good product! Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this as a tick and flea repellant on my dogs.  So far so good.  I haven&#x27;t seen a tick or flea since using.  I did use almond oil to thin it.</li>
    <li> I had two ticks last week from working in a new garden. I ordered and put on the oil today and I trimmed around trees with a push mower and worked out in the garden.  Came onto a patio to put something away and behold a tick was falling off me.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> We bought this to put a few drops on ours dogs&#x27; collars because external parasites are naturally repelled by this essential oil. We are using a natural spray on them to so I can&#x27;t give the rose geranium all the credit but they haven&#x27;t had a single tick since we put in on their collars. They do smell a bit too much like old ladies for dad&#x27;s sensibilities but mom doesn&#x27;t mind it!</li>
    <li> Great on fever blisters.</li>
    <li> works well in crock pot filled with water and a few drops added  makes house smell nice</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent and I was able to use this to make a tic spray to use while camping.</li>
    <li> I use this on my dogs as a tick repellent. It works greats, smells nice and lasts all day. Love this essential oil!</li>
    <li> Like many others who reviewed, I bought this to use as a tick repellent for my dog. I stopped using frontline and began using this. I have not found any ticks on my dog since I started using it two months ago. I haven&#x27;t been in any deep woods or tall grass with him since I began using it, to be fair. I love the smell on my dog and I&#x27;m looking to get an essential oil diffuser to use with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle, cap or orifice reducer in the other hand are not working well. If I store the bottle on its side it seems to leak and when pouring the oil, it drops too fast and leaks down the side of the bottle when you upright the bottle again. The cap and orifice reducers don&#x27;t seem to be well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have other Eden Garden essential oils and from other brands as well and I have not encountered these problems with any of them so maybe I got a defective bottle.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with the service and quality of the product.</li>
    <li> In a discussion with a friend on essential oils, she tried to inform me that there were only 2 companies that sold pure therapeutic grade essential oil. Of course she was involved with one of the multi-level marketing essential oil companies that have convinced her of this. I wrote Edens Garden to ask them about the quality of their oils and what was reported to me. They PROMPTLY replied with a very thorough letter explaining where and how they get their oils. As stated, &amp;#34;All our oils are 100% pure therapeutic grade. We take very great pride in offering the highest quality essential oils available.  We have chosen to not add any bases, carriers, additives, etc to any of our oils. All USDA food/product safety guidelines are strictly followed by our suppliers.  This is very important to us and something we do not compromise one bit on........When the oil is received, most companies (including &amp;^%&amp;^%$, %^$^*^ and Edens Garden) will conduct their own testing to determine if the quality meets their standards.&amp;#34; There was more to the letter, but suffice it to say...I will purchase all of my essential oils from this company. Delivery was prompt and dealing directly with them on my questions was effortless. Great company policy!</li>
    <li> bought for someone else, she loved it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my absolute favorite scents.  It&#x27;s floral and feminine but still kind of gentle on the nose.  I received my oil(s) rather quickly too.</li>
    <li> I am vary happy with the Rose Geranium I ordered.</li>
    <li> This really does work on keeping ticks from biting.  It does smell strange so I just put it on the bottom of my feet then put on shoes so that fixes that problem.  I think it is much healtier than using the highest DEET directly on my skin.</li>
    <li> Keeps the ticks off. I live in an area highly populated in deer ticks and lyme. Have not found any ticks on me or my 4 children since using this daily.  Came quickly. Great product.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully as a tick and flea deterrent when dabbed on our puppies collars. Can be overpowering if too much is used, but we love the natural defense it provides!</li>
    <li> I saw a post on Facebook about Rose Geranium oil working as a natural tick repellant for dogs. At first I was skeptical, but I have to say, it honestly works. Each morning I put a drop on the base of their tail, one on their neck and one one the belly. I&#x27;ve only had to remove two ticks in the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using the Rose Geranium oil. It does smell a bit strong, but works great as a natural alternative to the typical topical pesticides recommended for tick repellant. I have two dogs, have been using the bottle for two weeks and it&#x27;s still 3/4 full. If you&#x27;re looking for holistic pest control for your pets, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Used this product as a repellent for ticks on my dog, I put a few drops on the inside of her collar and it seems to work as she did not have any ticks on her after the application. I repeated each week. I think it works for that. The smell was a bit over powering, but if the ticks were repelled from it...So be it!!</li>
    <li> VERY strong smell. I use it to prevent ticks naturally. So far, it has seemed to prevent ticks from latching onto my dog. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t quite such a strong smell.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite oil I &#x27;ve purchased so far! I mix it with a carrier oil and use it for a skin moisturizer. I mostly smell the rose in it, and get a lot of compliments on it. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Dog had 9 ticks in one week. Since we have been using it (three weeks now) zero ticks. Seems to work. One drop on base of neck and tail before hikes, or about three to five times a week is what we&#x27;ve been doing.</li>
    <li> not what expected, horrible smell and strong</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this product as indicated this summer and so far so good - no ticks on us or our dogs.  Follow directions particularly for pets!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my dog as an alternative to the potentially cancer-causing flea &amp; tick medicines, and I haven&#x27;t seen a flea or tick on her all summer. One drop between the shoulders does the trick.</li>
    <li> This seems to be working we have had no Ticks I don&#x27;t think the dog cares for the smell as looks for smelly things to roll in.</li>
    <li> I received this quickly at a reasonable price and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> strong smell and great essential oil</li>
    <li> Smells great.  I use this instead of buying a tick repellent for myself and my dog.</li>
    <li> Only need a little. Very strong</li>
    <li> Used this on our dog as tick prevention while hiking in the woods.  One drop between the shoulder blades and one at the base of his tail.  Worked great since he was bitten by nothing.  I put some on myself and husband too; on wrists, behind ears, and on the inner part of ankles.  Kept bugs off us too.</li>
    <li> Helps keep ticks away! I used to get ticks almost every time on hikes, now i have only had one out of going many times, it works</li>
    <li> ticks? Haven&#x27;t had any sense I&#x27;ve used this stuff. And I&#x27;m outdoors a LOT</li>
    <li> I bought this to put on my dogs to protect them from ticks. I don&#x27;t like chemicals, so I was looking for a natural, healthy alternative to chemical tick repellants. Unfortunately, this smells like a funeral home, and my husband complained so much about how badly the dogs smelled that I quit using it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful pure high grade product. Great for keeping bugs off of yourself while working in the garden and being outdoors.</li>
    <li> Not to much of  difference from the regular Geranium oil. a bit sweeter,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as a flea/tick repellant for my small dogs because I don&#x27;t want to expose them to the harmful poisons present in most products out there. I am pleased with how this works. I have found one or two stray ticks, but nothing compared to before. This really works!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use on my pup to keep ticks away. A little bit goes a long way. This stuff works great and lasts a long time but the smell can be a bit overpowering</li>
    <li> Working great for ticks on dogs and horses (and us).  Fast service</li>
    <li> Excellent results, using it to repel ticks on two of my dogs who never have had them before this summer. Apply it twice a week and no more ticks !</li>
    <li> I used it for natural tick repelent on my dog and it worked great</li>
    <li> Like it a lot!!! most of my friends like its scent in my hand-made lip moisturiser. Good choice and will buy it again for sure!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Smells great, haven&#x27;t used yet so I can&#x27;t give a product in use review.</li>
    <li> We will use this in our defense against ticks and Lyme.  Lets hope it goes well.</li>
    <li> I bought it because it&#x27;s suppose to repel ticks from dogs. Didn&#x27;t work! Dogs got ticks.</li>
    <li> very pricey, works fantastic for ticks when morel mushroom hunting. I FOUND A SUPER REPLACEMENT FOR THIS PRODUCT. AT WWW. WFmed.com  .A 1 OUNCE BOTTLE IS $9.29 PLUS FREE SHIPPING. AND YES IT IS ( PELARGONIUM CAPITATUM X RADENS VARIETY</li>
    <li> I bought this product for tick control on my dogs. It did not seem to help at all.</li>
    <li> I have not used this for any therapeutic purposes yet, but have used it as a perfume substitute. I like to dab just a drop behind my ears and in other warm and inviting places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, though - like all essential oils, this is quite potent. More than one drop (shared among all of the spots I dab it on) will be overpowering and  you&#x27;ll be more stinky than yummy.</li>
    <li> bought as a tick repellant for my dogs.  The smell was too much for them.</li>
    <li> Using as tick repellent for my dogs.  Seems to work well.</li>
    <li> We got this to help keep ticks off our dog. It seems to work! It&#x27;s just hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> as part of a natural insect repellent...this worked very well.</li>
    <li> using for tick control on my dogs mixed with a carrier oil.  seems good.  love the scent.</li>
    <li> Ticks were somewhat repelled. Still found quite a few on myself and my dog. All other bugs seem to LOVE this product though. I couldn&#x27;t go outside without flying bugs following me EVERYWHERE!! And the whole house smelled like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; from 2 drops. I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Have used in several essential oil recipes already. Smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I am using this to keep ticks off my dogs and it seems to be working. Since I started using this they have not had a single tick.  I just put some on their collars each day before they go outside.</li>
    <li> Works great for keeping ticks off while out hiking.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Only need to use one drop. Smells nice and the scent lasts for days.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Ordered this based on all the positive reviews and I am glad I did. My main reason for purchasing it was for tick protection. Since putting it on my dog she has not gotten one tick! She doesn&#x27;t seem to like the smell but I think it is pleasant</li>
    <li> Use this as a tick repellent for my dog. It works but must be applied on a daily basis. Much cheaper and infinitely healthier than a chemical-filled repellant bought from the vet!</li>
    <li> The bottle was so small.</li>
    <li> Just great wonderful a must have, very relaxing, the aroma is very soft but still there, I&#x27;m in love, will buy again</li>
    <li> Great quality. Use for a tick repellant. Since I took it on a trip but didnt get to really test it as were we went still had snow on the ground. But I sure will give the big test when we go camping. Smells wonderful and chased off the ants near the fireplace plus made the room smell great!</li>
    <li> Anyone that likes the great outdoors, but dislikes all the annoying insects that love us..this is the product for you.!!!</li>
    <li> I use this on my dog to prevent ticks and it is very effective.  I put a little in my palm and rub behind her ears, collars and lightly over fur and elsewhere where ticks bite.</li>
    <li> I am familiar with the smell of commonly used essential oils.  This one smells EXACTLY like lemon oil.  i think it was mismarked. If you want the scent of roses, don&#x27;t get this one.</li>
    <li> Not sure about keeping ticks off my pets, but it certainly keeps my husband within a mile&#x27;s range!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No - seriously, people that are buying this, please consider your spouses. It has a very potent (lovely) smell that is not agreeable to some people.&lt;br /&gt;I personally love it, but my husband says it smells kind of like mosquito repellant, or something equally strong.</li>
    <li> Perfect quality...but way too expensive.</li>
    <li> I would imagine this is effective tick repellant because it literally made me nauseous.  I just got it to create a body mist and it made my stomach turn.  I also ordered sandalwood and vanilla from this vendor, both of which were terrible.  I just received all three in the mail and threw them all out.  Would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil as a tick repellant, and I have not had one tick since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
    <li> Use this in homemade bugspray with almond oil. Repels most insects including ticks and mosquitoes. Still find an occasional tick on my dog or myself, but not attached. Mosquitoes and deer flies will hover and occasionally land, but usually immediately fly away. Longer lasting than cheaper varieties, but I still wish it was either less expensive or shipping was free.</li>
    <li> Need very little. Beautiful aroma. Did not find it worked well to repel fleas, though.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my skin. Used Geranium oil for my face before and it was awesome! Ran out and decided to buy some more. Never heard of Rose Geranium, but it smells delicious! And the shipping was extremely fast! Would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY thing that has worked against ticks for my Yorkie. Not one tick has been seen since I started putting this on her.</li>
    <li> A drop on the dogs&#x27; collars and tail and a drop on our own neck and legs keeps us all protected from flies and ticks during hikes!&lt;br /&gt;(I also use a few drops of a mix of peppermint &amp; cedar essential oil around doors and windows as a general bug repellant.)</li>
    <li> We bought this as a tick repellent.  When we remember to use it....no ticks on the dog!  And she smells like a garden.</li>
