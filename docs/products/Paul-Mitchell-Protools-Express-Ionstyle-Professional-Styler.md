<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very good flat iron. Doesn&#x27;t friz my hair and straightens hair very fast. Way better than a Chi.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing, the best I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used everything from a cheap drug store iron to a CHI, and this one is the best hands down. I have short, thick, coarse, curly hair (think Seth Rogen) that&#x27;s very stubborn. I was using a cheap Conair iron from CVS and I hated how long it took me to straighten my hair, and it never fully got it straight, there was still some curl at the ends. After upgrading to this I am astonished I went so long using a cheap iron. This thing gets HOT, I actually had to turn it down, and even at a lower setting it got the job done exceptionally well. I don&#x27;t have to leave it on my hair long at all, just quick passes gets my hair completely straight. My hair is left soft and shiny, not dry and split at the ends. I have so many new ways I can do my hair now thanks to this thing, its awesome! Not to mention it has cut the amount of time I need to spend straightening my hair by at least half, and with much better results. I also like that I don&#x27;t have to squeeze hard to get a firm clamp on my hair, I believe this is due to the cushion. You don&#x27;t always get what you pay for, so I was hesitant at first to spend this much on a flat iron, but after using it I am so happy that I did! Paul Mitchell lives up to his name!</li>
    <li> This flat iron saved the day when I went to Jamaica and my hair completely frizzed up, was so glad I had packed it.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  Smooths hair well.  Bought to replace old black/green model.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve only had this straightener for a day but I love it! I had the green and black Paul Mitchell that a few people have mentioned and I loved it until the cord shorted out and it stopped working.     But after reading reviews online I saw that quite a few people like this straightener. And it&#x27;s really good! I have thick, wavy hair and I only had to run each section through one or two times for it to come out straight! It also looks super silky and takes the frizz out.     Hopefully this one won&#x27;t have the problems the black and green one had. So far it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> It works well for me.  I have straight hair that is medium length.  I can slide the styler over the hair from the top,&lt;br /&gt;eliminate the frizzies, and give it a small flip under at the ends.  Saves lots of bad hair days.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it, leave my hair soft and healthy, it does damage my hair</li>
    <li> I am new to flat ironing and purchased this flat iron at the suggestion of my stylist-it is the one she uses and I have been happy with the results when she does my hair except for one time when I think she needed to clean the residue off her plates. When I first got the product I took it to the salon and had my stylist do my hair so my inexperience would not be a factor if I was not happy with the results. I am glad I did becuase it pulled my hair to the point where it looked kind of static-y, and she was pulling hair off the plates about every 4-5 swipes toward the end. When I asked she said hers did the same thing when it was new. I am admittedly a novice with this type of styling but that seemed odd to me. I went to a store that sells different types of flat irons and ran some of them over my hair (they weren&#x27;t plugged in) just to see the difference-only this one and one really cheap one pulled. I deduced it was the silicone strips because none of the other irons had those, including the 1.25 Paul Mitchell iron, which I also tried. The other things most people look for in a flat iron are met by this product: it heats up in 60 seconds, it is easy to grip, cools off quickly, 1-2 glides to get the hair really straight, and the result is soft with a nice shine. However, it seems to me that prolonged use with that kind of pulling is damaging and a new product should not do that. It is too bad, otherwise this is a great iron and would have received a 5 star rating from me.</li>
    <li> I got this iron about 4 years ago when my \\&quot;cheapy\\&quot; one from Walmart died. It still works like I just bought it. It is absolutely wonderful and is definitely comparable to a CHI.</li>
    <li> OMG this thing is the best.  I think it&#x27;s the silicone strips that make your hair so shiney...for days!  I have been saving up for this and it was worth the wait.  One hint tho&#x27;, when styling your hair if you go over your hair with the iron lots of times, your hair may look a touch greasy.  Also, you don&#x27;t have to use high heat on the iron if you have already blown out your hair straight.</li>
    <li> It was a gift but I was told it is great</li>
    <li> i am so happy i opened the box before retunr date. I already have this flat iron, however it is giving out. so i thought hey top bueaty has one for $147.00. this iron in the sotres costs $302.00. i thought i was geting a deal. boy was i wrong. i compared this iron to the one i alrady have and i HIGHLY suspect this is a replica. its is lighter then the one i have, plastic is really cheap. rubber lining it thicker and fatter then mine, and the lettering on the product are slightly different. i did get a refund and had no problem returning it. thanks goodness</li>
    <li> It really does make your hair smooth, even your hair is thick and frizzy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m caucasion with think, curly, medium length, hair....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every straightener out there.... literally every single one - Paul Mitchell Express Ionstyle is the best out there!

Blow hair until it&#x27;s 60 percent dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gather the hair on top of your crown and secure it with a clip. Begin drying the lower layers with a brush, using more heat. Point the dryer&#x27;s nozzle downward to help smooth hair and create shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove the clip and use it to hold the now-dry lower layers back and away. Secure like a very loose, low ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blow-dry the top section. Aim at the roots to add volume, then work toward the ends, using the brush to pull hair forward and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove the clip. Flip all hair back. Part and dry hair around the forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roll ends under with a round brush, and blow dry with warm air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straightening:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Begin by separating your hair into sections vertically. The thicker your hair, the more sections you should have. Clip the top first, then make sections all the way down your head, leaving the last section loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab a section of your hair and place the flat iron as close to the roots as possible without it burning your scalp. Slide the iron down the section gradually. Don&#x27;t stop in any one place or it will make your hair look crimped! Let go as the iron reaches your hand and pull the iron through to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Repeat this process from one side of your head to the other horizontally. After you complete each section, unclip the section above it and repeat the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!with warm air.

    <li> I got this as a birthday gift a few years ago and I have loved it since first use. I use to have an FHI (I think that&#x27;s what its called)like one of the other reviewers it ruined the texture of my hair. But back to the Paul Mitchell. I love that I can get close to salon straight hair and style. It leaves my hair so soft and undamaged I love it! When this one goes dead (if it ever does) I will be replacing it with another!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic iron, but be forewarned: all Paul Mitchell warranties are void if the product is not purchased from an authorized PM salon.  Sellers will not advertise this, but it says clearly on the box that the product is only guaranteed if bought at a salon.  I spoke with a PM representative and they said they have a problem with people illegally \\&quot;redirecting\\&quot; products from the factory.  They also have people who try and refurbish old products and sell them as new.  Because of this, PM will not fix or replace anything that wasn&#x27;t bought at a salon, so if you happen to get one of those refurbished models and it breaks in the first couple of months, you can&#x27;t do much about it.  If you&#x27;re comfortable without a warranty, though, go for it.  If you get a new iron, it&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> Received the product on time. It works pretty good. This is the same one my professional hairstylists uses, so I thought I would get the same effect. I think I need to use product on my hair first and she suggested not to use daily as I would dry my hair out. Very excited to have it in my hands.</li>
    <li> I just used this straightener for the first time and I LOVE it! After my CHI stopped working,  I was looking for a flat iron that works on my thick coarse wavy hair and I bought a more expensive Babyliss, which I liked at first but then realized it was damaging my hair so I bought this Paul Mitchell flat iron and it exceeded my expectations. Not only did it take me half the time to straighten my hair, but my hair didn&#x27;t get any breakage and my it even left my hair slightly shinier! I usually have to use a finishing cream to keep my hair from frizzing out, but I didn&#x27;t need to use it this time! It&#x27;s definitely money well spent!</li>
    <li> This iron is the best straightener i ever had. I love that it can curl more naturally then other blocky sillouette straighteners and I love the grips feature in the plates.IT also really makes your hair shiny and smooth like it says. the only downfall i have is that it doesnt stay straight long for me, but that may be becouse i have very thick , coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron (to replace my CHI that unfortunately died) at the recommendation of my hair stylist.  I have only ever used CHI Irons, and I like them, but I was looking to branch out.  This iron heats up very quickly, and my hair looks and feels great.  I used it for the first time yesterday morning and my coworkers noticed how smooth my locks looked!  My hair is pretty thin so one pass over my hair with this straightener did the trick!  The iron has a light that blinks when it reaches the desired temperature.  I was already set to return it, because I thought that meant there was a short in the power cord.  Luckily, I read the owners manual before I packed it up!  Now that I realize what the blinking light is for, I think that it is a great feature!  This is a great hair tool, and I will continue to use Paul Mitchell products.</li>
    <li> I had one of these already and it was old, so I was already familiar with the flat iron</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron, it works amazing!</li>
    <li> only lasted like a year</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product and  transaction</li>
    <li> This is the best hair straightener I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been using a Chi for the past five years, but with this product I have much better results. My hair no longer catches at all in the straightener. I really like that I can set the exact temperature I want with a dial and it only takes a few seconds to heat up. I have very curly hair and only have to run my hair through once for perfectly straight hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> Sleek design. Easy to handle and style with it</li>
    <li> Do not buy way over priced and does not live but to its own write up.  You can fins something at Wal-Mart that will heat up the same ::((((&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also getting this item took over two weeks after i ordered and was charged on my credit card</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener. Other expensive straighteners would take me at least 45 minutes to achieve what this one does in 10 minutes. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> This flat iron go hard as hell. My boo thang use this every day. She say she ain&#x27;t never had it so good. ;)</li>
    <li> I have bought 5 hot irons in the last year.  The problem with all the irons is they snag my fine hair. My daughter bought this iron and I tried it. THE BEST IRON I HAVE EVER USED!!! Does not snag my hair and usually all it takes is one swipe. All I can say is I LOVE THIS IRON and will never buy another brand!!!</li>
    <li> The Paul Mitchell flat iron is working wonderful so far.  I&#x27;m loving it and it&#x27;s a really good tool.  I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist, but I can do a great job on my daughter&#x27;s hair using this tool.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. First purchased it back in 2008 and fell in love. It&#x27;s lasted me 6+ years and  then it pooped out on me. I was going to venture out and buy a different flat iron but nothing compares to the quality of the PM.</li>
    <li> The iron does an excellent job making the hair straight and silky smooth. I love that it heats so quickly!  It was recommended by my hairdresser as the kind she uses professionally in her salon.</li>
    <li> I love it couldnt be any happier with it works great an leaves my hair nice and straight. Wouldnt trade it for no other.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every brand of flat irons and I was never satisfied with the results. My hair is very stubborn, thin, and damaged. When I used this for the first time it immediately changed my hair. It has more volume and shine now while perfectly straightening my hair, even those hard to get baby hairs and my roots. This is buy far the best flat iron and I&#x27;d recommended it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Received the item quickly and it was just as described. Loved my old one but after two years and lots of drops it finally had enough. Great product so I went and got the same one again.</li>
    <li> This is easily the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used and/or owned FHI, Croc, CHI, Avanti, T3, and a few more I can&#x27;t recall.  The silicone strips are ingenious.  They grip the hair, meaning that it gets straight and smooth with fewer passes.  The iron heats up very quickly.  After blow drying with a 2000 watt dryer, I can straighten my whole head of hair (bra strap length, wavy, fine but thick) in 6 minutes.  That&#x27;s about 5 minutes less than with any other iron -- I simply don&#x27;t have to do as many passes, due to the silicone strips and the high, even heat.  Fewer passes mean less damage and less time spent in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this flat iron, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Only straightening iron that doesnt kill my hair. This is my second time ordering this iron and only because thr first one died after five years of loyal service.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom. She is in her sixty&#x27;s and her hair is all silver. She absolutely loves this straightener. It leaves her hair so shiny and healthy looking. I am going to order one for myself as soon as I save some money.</li>
    <li> I have a Chi iron that has last for years. However, this gives me a smoother look in less time. The finish I get with this iron is nicer and last longer. The possibility of adjusting the temperature is also great. I am really happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday but when I do I really like it.  It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair and it leaves it really shiny and straight.  I also love that I can curl my hair with it.  I would totally recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> After a faithful relationship with Chi, I decided to try something new. I had heard mostly positive things about the Paul Mitchell flat iron, and I love the hair products, so I thought it would be worth a try. Much to my disappointment the flippin thing breaks after a mere couple of weeks. I should note that it broke by falling into the sink...my chis have survived much greater hardships! Now the flat iron part is flapping loose and the rubber protectors slide out. It&#x27;s basically busted. AND since I bought it on amazon, the real annoying part is that there&#x27;s no warranty AND Paul Mitchell doesn&#x27;t sell its products parts nor can I find any info on their website about repairs.</li>
    <li> It was everything I wanted in a flat iron. It gets extremely hot and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. I can straighten it in no time at all.</li>
    <li> will highly  recommend&lt;br /&gt;i likely  this product  a lot  and will recommend it to al my friends easy on your hair</li>
    <li> love this hair straighter. I don&#x27;t know what i ever did with out it. i will never buy another brand. Well worth the money and last a long time. My first one lasted me about 6 years.</li>
    <li> The Best flat iron ever!  Love it.</li>
    <li> This product works well to straighten my hair but has two important flaws.  One is that it does not have an auto off.  I have had others that did not either but they had a very visible light showing it is on.  This one will not sit on the counter to make the on light visible.&lt;br /&gt;The other problem is the flashing lights that stay on when ever the styler is plugged in.  It uses lots of electricity but is a hassle to unplug after each use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product!  Takes no time to see results.  I&#x27;m glad I invested in a hair straightener that actually works!</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter she LOVES it, its very nice. Quality materials, nice feel... you can tell this is made to last. She uses it to do lose curls too and it does this very nicely. nicer than my Paul Mitchell.. so it must be some new design. Her hair is naturally beautiful, but this may actually make it more shiney.. Idk, though its hard to say... But I will say that I learned after replacing 2 Chi&#x27;s, to listen to my stylist and spend 20 more bucks and get a PAUL!  I&#x27;ve had my Paul Mitchell for 2 1/2 years, (both my Chi&#x27;s lasted about 12 months). I got tired of sharing my Paul though, so I got this one for my teenage daughter. She&#x27;s had hers about 5 months. Love the adjustable settings the quality feel, super fast heat up, and on/off switch.. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is great and worth the money.  It is easy to travel with and the cord is really long which is great.</li>
    <li> It does everything it promises to create the look you want.&lt;br /&gt;The cushioned ceramic plates help keep your hair healthy, you can use daily even on baby fine hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;You can curl it and it stays all day. No lines. No pulling.( use heal shield spray)&lt;br /&gt;It heats in seconds, it takes me 1O min to do my hair and go. ( it also works on thick hair fast too).&lt;br /&gt;My hair remains SHINEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have had mine for almost 8 years. It still works but I was looking to get a new iron so I am not without one. I wish it came in fun colors to add SAS but oh well. I bought mine through a licensend cosmetologist for $99.00 in 2005/06.</li>
    <li> This iron is the perfect size, the width is great and it really makes your hair shiny.I highly recommend this flat iron</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have tried</li>
    <li> i like it and it will last a long time and does not burn my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second one and the first one lasted for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> Fast heat-up.  Temperature controlled.  Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the money!  Would recommend.  I really think it will last.  That&#x27;s important...</li>
    <li> Love this! What a difference than the cheap one I had</li>
    <li> I have really wavy curly hair that&#x27;s has a mind of its own. This product is great!! It does exactly want it is supposed to do. I get compliments on my hair all the time. It&#x27;s worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I first bought this flat iron five years ago from my stylist. I have used it to straighten, wave, and curl my hair. It has traveled with me internationally, multiple times a year, and never have I been disappointed in this flat iron. After five years, it has started heating up slower, and the light doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I have tried out other straighteners such as CHI, T3, and others, and been downright dismayed at what they did to my hair. From breakage, to pulling, they have put my hair through the ringer, and I always come back to my barely functioning Paul Mitchel. I have repurchased this flat iron and returned my T3 to Nordstrom. I will never stray again!!!</li>
    <li> I bought mine 2 years ago&lt;br /&gt;i need the to remplace the silicone stripes and he was rude very short and told me he didnt have no parts for that item and kept repeating that i had to do my research,,,,which i told him i already did but paul mitchell didnt want to give me or sell me the strips because i did not buy it directly with them.&lt;br /&gt;Very rude and cold hearted seller&lt;br /&gt;Dont deal with him</li>
    <li> My wife says she &amp;#34;Loves it&amp;#34;.  A little pricy but it does what other brands won&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever! This is my 2nd one , the first one i bought a year and a half ago, and I actually gave to my sister to replace her chi iron that did not work well for her, i felt bad so i gave her mine and i repurchased! I have this one and the 2inch black smooth styler! Love them both! And they are all still working just perfectly fine :)</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way.</li>
    <li> Love it! Best flat iron ever!, and shipped very soon! Worth the money! Will never get another flat iron again!</li>
    <li> Totally worthless. My $30 target hair straightener puts this product to shame. It&#x27;s a joke that they charge this much for such a horrible device.</li>
    <li> I have used many diffrent flat iron&#x27;s and know a lot about them, I&#x27;v used stuff from baby-bliss, GHD, KQC, to the chi and this one beat&#x27;s them all.&lt;br /&gt;It get&#x27;s it done in half of the time and make&#x27;s my hair feel great becouse the silicone strips grip my hair ( NOT PULL) so it get&#x27;s the job done quicker! I love this flat iron.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a flat iron that can get hot fast and works great, this iron works great. It&#x27;s one of the best flat irons sold.</li>
    <li> I replaced my 10 year old CHI.  This gets hot fast and slides though my hair like butter...straightening it in 1 pass.  It is compact though for travel.</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly what I was looking for at a really great price. My sister bought one also and she loves hers as well!</li>
    <li> Bought this flat iron as my stylist recommended it. I used it several times and it works very well on my wavy hair. Love the product.</li>
    <li> It was for a gift, had one before it is great</li>
    <li> Easy to handle, gets hot fast, Love the ceramic plates and In just minutes TaDah!!!! straight hair Thanks Paul Mitchell</li>
    <li> If you want a professional flat iron, long chord, good sturdy and reliable, this is the best one I have owned.  I&#x27;m on my third one because I have one in each of my homes and recently burnt one out due to plugging it into the wrong outlet while traveling abroad.</li>
    <li> I got this straightener about 6 years ago or so when I think it first came out. I just got my second one in the mail today. This is by far the best straightener I have ever used. I have naturally curly/frizzy thick hair and I only have to pull this through a strand of hair once and its straight and shiny. My hair never looks dead or damaged from using this one even if I go 6+ months without a haircut. The only reason I am on my second one is because after 6 years my first one is starting to smell funny, kinda like burnt (but I wasn&#x27;t the best at keeping up on cleaning it and I use product in my hair). But for lasting me this long and using it every single day I am not complaining. I have tried plenty of other products and NOTHING compares to this. My mom will be getting this one too some time soon because she has loved using mine any chance she gets. I would 100% without a doubt recommend this straightener to anyone and everyone. And I just want to mention since I do have curly frizzy hair I wanted to point out that the gripper strips have never pulled my hair to where it hurts or falls out. That is actually the best part of this straightener. Bottom line if you are thinking about ordering this one you should, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I had heard that paul mitchell was the best. I had been replacing my flat iron every two years. Daily use, and it is performing as expected.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this iron for 4 months now and she absolutely loves it. It is to her understanding of beauty salon quality. Her hair doesn&#x27;t burn or get stuck, on the contrary, her hair seems as shiny as ever. This iron leaves her hair flat with less strokes than her previous iron which was a &amp;#34;chi&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Picture of this item is mis-leading. This was not what I expected. This may have been an older model.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Paul Mitchell flat iron.  Smooths the hair in one swipe.  Absolutely in love with this particular one.  I&#x27;ve tried other PM irons and this one is great. Takes a lot less time than other flat irons.  I would purchase it again if needed.  Complete satisfaction with this entire purchase.</li>
    <li> My Master Stylist has used this flat iron on m hair for several years and it has always left my hair silky and does a great job straightening it without frying the ends like my last one did. It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I already own one of these, have been bringing it back and forth with me (every two weeks) from CA to NH for probably over 5 years and last time I forgot it! OMG what am I going to do? Okay, just spend the money on having two and don&#x27;t worry about forgetting it again. This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve found. I let my sister-in-law borrow it once and now she has one too! There is nothing about it that I don&#x27;t love!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, it is a gift.  She will love it.  She has been asking for a straightener of her own for a few months, and know Paul Mitchell Products are well designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Mommy, Tammy</li>
    <li> Yeah it&#x27;s a knock off of the real product.</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this flat iron because of a few negative reviews.  And I wasn&#x27;t very happy with my last Paul Mitchell flat iron.  But I&#x27;m not sure how anyone can say anything negative about this iron.  I love it just for the sheer fact that it glides through my hair like no other iron I have ever tried.  And I&#x27;ve tried every brand - Chi, Babyliss Pro, Hot Tools, GHD, John Frieda.  The iron that this is replacing is a Babyliss Pro which I loved until recently when it started snagging my hair?  I have this iron set on a much lower temperature than I have had to use with other irons and it still does what it is supposed to.  I do not like to use a flat iron every day and if a flat iron is good, you shouldn&#x27;t have to.  Whatever Paul Mitchell did to these plates to make them glide so effortlessly I hope they continue in future products!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this iron on my hair and I&#x27;ve always liked it so I finally decided to buy one. It was a little pricier than my last iron, but it works really well. It leaves my hair shiny and straightens really easily. The products I use (Abba Blow Dry Lotion and Beverly Hills Revive Coconut Oil) help with the shine and softness too, otherwise, I notice the heat from the iron eventually dries my hair out. I&#x27;m very happy with my iron and I&#x27;ve had it for a month now!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this flat iron.  I use it a few times a week to straighten my hair.  I have also used it to curl my hair.  I have long hair and didn&#x27;t think I would like the silicon grips, but I love them.  After 1 year everything is still like-new, granted I do not use this every day.  It doesn&#x27;t take any time to heat up and the adjuster for the temperature stays in the same spot.  IF I had to say something I didn&#x27;t like about this flat iron, it would be the heat indicator light.  It Flashes all the time, whether it is hot or warming up.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this styler.  You can make your hair straight or wavy; it&#x27;s great.  Best price too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and her sister and her use it just about every day to every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;does what it says and straightens hair, and keeps it straight all day.</li>
    <li> i have used this flat iron twice. the first time i used it a very small section of my hair fried!!! I thought it might be because of sun damage so i used it again today and it fried my hair all along the top ridge. I have long blonde hair and i used a \\&quot;corioliss flat iron\\&quot; for 10 years and never had a problem until it finally wore out so borrowed this one from my daughter in haste. i am so sorry i used it. the hair shaft has been permanently damaged!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Buy the Corioliss professional straightening iron instead, it costs much less and goes thru hair like butter. I will have to get my hair thinned out now in hopes to get rid of the damage!!!!</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for 6 years and it has not given out on me yet! It still heats up within 30 seconds or sooner, adds shine to my hair like none other. This straightener can straighten any type of hair in no time! I have used many types of straighteners between friends and salon visits, this is by far my favorite one. I pray that Paul Mitchell never stops making these because I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome! This is coming from a girl with naturally curly, thick, coarse hair. This straightener makes my hair as straight as a board and makes it very silky and soft. It straightens fast too!!</li>
