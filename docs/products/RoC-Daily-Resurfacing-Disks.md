      <li>, it&#x27;s a good primer just not under the IT cosmetic foundation.</li>
      <li>I thought this product would be a good alternative to the Roc primer.  </li>
      <li>but the results are not as good as the marketing</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
      <li>But nice if you are not going to wear makeup.</li>
      <li>It primes the skin perfectly for foundation and leaves it smooth, illuminated and fresh looking.</li>

      <li>&quot; my skin felt soooo smooth!  </li>

      <li>I use it on top</li>
      <li>Has a great feel on your skin and really works.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>as a result I see more and more flaws with my makeup application...</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much more affordable these products are at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Light bulb moment!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay,</li>
      <li>Im glad</li>
      <li>I purchase this item from Walmart and fell in love  with it.  </li>
      <li>Let the face instantly more illuminated,  younger, seems magical!&lt;br /&gt;Has  excellent quality, lasts a long time, excellent price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for the last couple days now and am super impressed...</li>
      <li>I agree that it has a nice velvety texture and at first appears to smooth complexion, but what does that matter if the product doesn&#x27;t even stay on your skin.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin smooth and my foundation glides on-</li>
      <li>Please keep it available</li>
      <li>It also leaves the face feeling smooth.  </li>
      <li>It is instantly and works great.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand how this product can have such great reviews.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>Super! Came quickly and as advertised</li>
      <li>The R.O.C. products have been excellent in the past.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several products like this and so far this has been the best for me.  </li>
      <li>As soon as it dries, it starts flaking off and just the light touch of a finger peels it right off my skin.</li>
      <li>and it comes off as quickly as my panties on prom.</li>
      <li>Well I&#x27;ve recently started wearing foundation to try to get more of a smooth creamy skin look, but things weren&#x27;t looking so smooth and creamy with the foundation.  </li>
      <li>When I first tried it, I thought \\&quot;hey, smooths out wrinkles well\\&quot;... but just try letting anything lightly brush your face</li>
      <li>Because of the price, I really expected this to be a good product.</li>
      <li>I very much like it.  </li>
      <li>I am more interested in something that will actually help the skin rather than a temporary fix.  </li>
      <li>Until or if something better comes along, I will continue to use this daily.  </li>
      <li>Like other RoC products, this one is effective and does exactly as it promises.</li>
      <li>Not as good as some of the more expensive products..</li>
      <li>Love the facial smoother and highly recommend</li>
      <li>Ok, so for a very long time I have been anti-product.  </li>
      <li>I really like the ROC product</li>
      <li>I started seeing real results within a couple of weeks, and after 6 weeks there really was a noticeable difference.</li>
      <li>but it makes your makeup go on much smoother.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>, I added this product to my daily routine,  The best part, a little  goes a long ways.</li>
      <li>I have been unable to find this in my local stores, so happy I found it on line!  </li>
      <li>Definitely makes skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten more and more blind with age, I use a magnifying mirror...</li>
      <li>what I like about this particular one is the silky consistency...which never seems oily...</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it to any woman who wants to look better with less makeup!</li>
      <li>It seems to soften the fine wrinkles somewhat just as well as the more expensive products that I have tried.</li>
      <li>Since they started jacking the price up though (it used to be $15), I&#x27;ve since looked elsewhere and have found that there are many other products these days that offer the same smoother, from places like Sephora etc.</li>
      <li>But it certainly doesn&#x27;t work the same way.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very helpful when adding foundation to my face after applying the facial smoother.</li>
      <li>- it makes my skin feel soft like velvet.  </li>
      <li>I have tried other skin products and rarely saw any improvements in my skin.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; anything other than make your face feel slippery.</li>
      <li>After applying anti-wrinkle creams &amp; moisturizer which leaves my facial skin very shiny, I use this product as an anti-gloss agent (works like powder without the residual mess).  </li>

<li> and I just kinda figured that was good enough and shame on all these companies for trying to make people feel like they need all this extra crap</li>
<li> It provides a good base for my very simple make up regime (read generally No make up).</li>

    <li> I have been unable to find this in my local stores, so happy I found it on line!  I LOVE this product, it is perfection for providing a primed complexion for underneath make-up and provides all of the wonderful ROC benefits as well.</li>
    <li> product works great, love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products like this and so far this has been the best for me.  It provides a good base for my very simple make up regime (read generally No make up). It also leaves the face feeling smooth.  It does just as it&#x27;s name says. I have very fair skin so I don&#x27;t notice an actual change in the complexion color but it may be a consideration with other complexions.</li>
    <li> I am happy you have the face smoother.,Some friends think I have had a face lift.I will never be without it as long as you have it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! Please keep it available</li>
    <li> I thought this product would be a good alternative to the Roc primer.  But it certainly doesn&#x27;t work the same way.  I am quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is great for reducing wrinkles and acne. I read an article in which a dermatologist had recommended it.</li>
    <li> The product lives up to its claims,I haven&#x27;t found any other product that works as well and I&#x27;ve tried many! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I started using ROC products a few years ago. I purchased them from the department store or online with other suppliers. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much more affordable these products are at Amazon. I started seeing real results within a couple of weeks, and after 6 weeks there really was a noticeable difference. I&#x27;m 65 years old and have tried the most expensive to the least, and this product line is the one I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and years. It does very little to help with wrinkles but it&#x27;s very helpful when adding foundation to my face after applying the facial smoother. It&#x27;s like magic. Since they started jacking the price up though (it used to be $15), I&#x27;ve since looked elsewhere and have found that there are many other products these days that offer the same smoother, from places like Sephora etc. I do admit, I really like the ROC product and I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars instead of 5 because I&#x27;m disappointed in the price gouging. The R.O.C. products have been excellent in the past. I do hope they are still the French products and that they haven&#x27;t changed over the years.</li>
    <li> I like the product, just doesn&#x27;t mix well with my current foundation.  But, it does what it says it will, it&#x27;s a good primer just not under the IT cosmetic foundation. And I won&#x27;t give up my IT.</li>
    <li> I think I use this for something other than it is supposedly for.  After applying anti-wrinkle creams &amp; moisturizer which leaves my facial skin very shiny, I use this product as an anti-gloss agent (works like powder without the residual mess).  Until or if something better comes along, I will continue to use this daily.  It&#x27;s a little pricey &amp; wish it were offered in a larger, less costly size.</li>
    <li> Definitely makes skin feel soft and smooth.  But when makeup applied over it, it seemed to cake a bit.  I am more interested in something that will actually help the skin rather than a temporary fix.  But nice if you are not going to wear makeup.</li>
    <li> I was pretty disappointed.  This product is basically just a silicon base.  It doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; anything other than make your face feel slippery.</li>
    <li> Am I missing something here? I don&#x27;t understand how this product can have such great reviews. It claims to prime and illuminate all day long but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my face longer than 10 minutes. As soon as it dries, it starts flaking off and just the light touch of a finger peels it right off my skin. It looks like I&#x27;ve got a sunburn peel--I wouldn&#x27;t dare put on this product before going out in public. I&#x27;m following the directions, so why does it work wonders for all of you and not even adhere to my skin? Could someone enlighten me as to what I could possibly be doing wrong? With or without make-up over it, it still peels away. I agree that it has a nice velvety texture and at first appears to smooth complexion, but what does that matter if the product doesn&#x27;t even stay on your skin. Because of the price, I really expected this to be a good product. Now I am hesitant to buy any primer.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference whatsoever. Save your money!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a little over a month now.  I have tried other skin products and rarely saw any improvements in my skin.  I like this facial smoother - it makes my skin feel soft like velvet.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Super! Came quickly and as advertised</li>
    <li> I use mist of roc skin care products the facial smoother is wonderful most of mine products are subscribe &amp; save</li>
    <li> This product is awesome . I am 51 and  wear foundation every day.  I purchase this item from Walmart and fell in love  with it.  It&#x27;s a cream white base which goes on your skin clear and smooth.  This product doesn&#x27;t change the color of my foundation, but enhance the way my foundation looks on the skin.  It makes my skin smooth and my foundation glides on- YES, glides on. Im glad, I added this product to my daily routine,  The best part, a little  goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> i bought this a while back used it a few times.  it&#x27;s okay, no big deal but honestly they have great advertising but the results are not as good as the marketing</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I use RoC Instant Facial Smoother over a year.  I can tell the difference. I use it on top my RoC Multi-Correxion 5-in-1. I will recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Is a wonderful alternative to foundation.  It covers just enough of the rough spots and redness to allow me to go without foundation.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the way this makes my skin feel, this i will most definately keep using for ever and ever</li>
    <li> Ok, so for a very long time I have been anti-product.  I had a moisturizer and I just kinda figured that was good enough and shame on all these companies for trying to make people feel like they need all this extra crap.... Well I&#x27;ve recently started wearing foundation to try to get more of a smooth creamy skin look, but things weren&#x27;t looking so smooth and creamy with the foundation.  So I started doing some internet research which brought me to RoC&#x27;s Instant Facial Smoother.  I was a little annoyed the first day I used it under my make-up because everything looked the same.  But the next day I brushed my hand across my face and was like \\&quot;Holy Crap!\\&quot; my skin felt soooo smooth!  I&#x27;ve been using it for the last couple days now and am super impressed... My make-up still looks like crap, but now I realize that&#x27;s the make-up and not my skin&#x27;s fault...</li>
    <li> After a delay in receiving the product, I received another one.....I very much like it.  It holds my moisturizer in and smooths my face where I can put make-up on without caking.</li>
    <li> This is my third or forth tube.  I am a fan.  As I&#x27;ve gotten more and more blind with age, I use a magnifying mirror...as a result I see more and more flaws with my makeup application...rough, dry patches, flaky skin....etc. (aging is no fun!)... I have used a bunch of different face primers and all work in a similar fashion...what I like about this particular one is the silky consistency...which never seems oily...oh and it works...a helpful product indeed.</li>
    <li> Makes skin feel a little greasy. Not as good as some of the more expensive products..but okay.  I like ROC but sometimes the product feels different each time.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It seems to soften the fine wrinkles somewhat just as well as the more expensive products that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Maybe you need to put something over this. When I first tried it, I thought \\&quot;hey, smooths out wrinkles well\\&quot;... but just try letting anything lightly brush your face and it comes off as quickly as my panties on prom. It almost looks like dried paste. I prefer Garnier Ultra-Lift.</li>
    <li> It is just simethicone but it makes your makeup go on much smoother. It takes very little for it to work</li>
    <li> Like other RoC products, this one is effective and does exactly as it promises. It primes the skin perfectly for foundation and leaves it smooth, illuminated and fresh looking. Use along with the RoC regimen for younger, brighter skin.</li>
    <li> This is the smoothest, best feeling moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Great under makeup.</li>
    <li> Let the face instantly more illuminated,  younger, seems magical!&lt;br /&gt;Has  excellent quality, lasts a long time, excellent price. I think that all  woman should to  use!!!</li>
    <li> One morning I forgot to use this product and wondered why the foundation I use seemed&lt;br /&gt;to drag so on my skin.  Light bulb moment!  Love the facial smoother and highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;it to any woman who wants to look better with less makeup!</li>
    <li> It is instantly and works great. It smooths and refines and is great for under your make-up or just for under you moisturizing cream. Has a great feel on your skin and really works.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
