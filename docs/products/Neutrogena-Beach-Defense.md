      <li>It is so easy to put on my kids</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, and stays put.</li>
      <li>Easy application on our kids</li>
      <li>I purchased this for Trinidad Carnival, it is easy to apply while on the road.</li>
      <li>Smells good and nice length, I can put on my 5 year old arms and legs quickly with 2 strokes.</li>
      <li>Wish it was fragrance free but otherwise easy to use on my kids</li>
      <li>Great for one-handed application, which was a big selling point for me (out in a kayak or stand up paddle board, you don&#x27;t want to be unscrewing a cap, squirting out lotion and massaging it in.  </li>
      <li>This is a great facial sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Great for carry-on travel when you can&#x27;t bring enough liquid sunscreen through TSA.</li>
      <li>Works great for facial area and the ears.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Airport security friendly as well.</li>
      <li>The only thing is that my coworkers asked why I was putting deodorant on my arms :P</li>
      <li>She doesn&#x27;t want to sit still and have lotion smeared on her, and she has some mild sensory issues regarding lotions.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Application is super fast and easy.</li>
      <li>is gentle to the skin and is SO easy to carry around.</li>
      <li>It also is nice because it covers a lot more surface area than the little sticks you can buy.</li>
      <li>Also, my hair that touched any of the sunscreen on my neck took on a very greasy appearance even though I had applied a light layer.</li>
      <li>glides on nicely, will definitely use this all the time!</li>
      <li>I bought this thinking it would be as good as the kids wet one.  </li>
      <li>For me, a one-handed flip-cap would be even better, but that doesn&#x27;t affect my review since it clearly doesn&#x27;t have that feature.</li>
      <li>Super fast to put on, isn&#x27;t greasy feeling, and the kids like it as well.</li>
      <li>Good smell and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks because it&#x27;s clear.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like use aerosol sunscreen on my daughter (tho I fo sometimes) especially on her face, so this is perfect for my little wiggleworm!</li>
      <li>No greasy hands, high SPF, no white residue and an amazing smell (like a strawberry banana smoothie).</li>
      <li>It is the first thing</li>
      <li>first sunscreen I have ever used that stained two shirts and ruined them.</li>
      <li>so this goes right over the whole head.  </li>
      <li>This version of sunscreen is great in theory, not good in practice.</li>
      <li>Great product easy to apply, works for normal sun exposure, fails under 6+ hours of equator sun in the indian ocean(ouch)</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is not sticky, goes on clear and dries quickly</li>
      <li>It also holds up better to hot weather than other sunblocks.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s much slimier and makes my face sweat profusely.  </li>
      <li>This is okay but feels greasier than I expected so</li>
      <li>It feels smooth, not gritty, going onto the skin.</li>
      <li>My wife and I REALLY like this application -</li>
      <li>I love this product, but it&#x27;s small and you can go through it quickly.  </li>
      <li>I can put it in my purse without worrying about it leaking, meaning that reapplication is easy to do and not as messy.</li>
      <li>I keep it in the car now for back up for my body, but really don&#x27;t like to use it on my face.</li>
      <li>Ok, it feels like you are slathering lip balm all over you, which is a little bit strange.</li>
      <li>my son has a sensitive face that stings with a lot of sunscreen, this is the only one he doesn&#x27;t cry when i apply while at the beach (which for us is 2-3 times a week)</li>

<li> applies quickly and with little mess; but hard to tell if you&#x27;ve covered the area properly and also seems to seal your sweat in or something.</li>
<li> Be careful-</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t replace my usual sunscreen back home but for traveling on a plane...</li>
<li> A little sticky on the skin.</li>
<li> and we used it everyday.</li>
<li> If there&#x27;s a little stubble on your face, head or hair on your arms, that&#x27;s where you the product gets thickly dispersed.  </li>
<li> Not sure if I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
<li> Gave me a terrible rash the first time I used it.</li>
<li> HOWEVER, I burn (and I mean burn!)</li>
<li> In fact, we burned only in the places we used this horrible product.</li>
<li> It does not have any stinky perfumes in it, and smells faintly of coconuts going on, but can&#x27;t be smelled once its on the skin.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s still too expensive.  </li>
<li> badly all the time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> FINALLY, sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t get all over your fingers or spray all over the place!</li>
    <li> Wish it was fragrance free but otherwise easy to use on my kids</li>
    <li> Does the job and is handy to carry in a pocket on a fishing trip.</li>
    <li> Good  item  !  no  creamy  white  on face  ,  no  sticky .</li>
    <li> Great product easy to apply, works for normal sun exposure, fails under 6+ hours of equator sun in the indian ocean(ouch)</li>
    <li> Awesome goes on smooth, not greasy.  Smells good and nice length, I can put on my 5 year old arms and legs quickly with 2 strokes. Great for kids who hate sunscreen application.</li>
    <li> Ok, it feels like you are slathering lip balm all over you, which is a little bit strange. HOWEVER, I burn (and I mean burn!) badly all the time. This is the only sunscreen that I have used ever in which I didn&#x27;t burn. I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to anything else, I hope they make it forever.</li>
    <li> A little sticky on the skin. Protection seems good.</li>
    <li> this product works great for us.  some friends who have borrowed it, say it&#x27;s too greasy for them.  but since we are in and out of the water a lot it&#x27;s nice to know when it&#x27;s wearing off to reapply!  my son has a sensitive face that stings with a lot of sunscreen, this is the only one he doesn&#x27;t cry when i apply while at the beach (which for us is 2-3 times a week)</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen. No greasy hands, high SPF, no white residue and an amazing smell (like a strawberry banana smoothie). The only thing is that my coworkers asked why I was putting deodorant on my arms :P</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel.  I purchased this for Trinidad Carnival, it is easy to apply while on the road.</li>

This version of sunscreen is great in theory, not good in practice.</li>
    <li> So easy to apply to face, ears, and neck for kids and adults!</li>
    <li> This was the only sunblock that I used on my body (used 100+spf for my face) for a week long trip to Jamaica, No sunburns here! Worked so well people asked me &amp;#34;Didn&#x27;t you just get back from Jamaica? Where&#x27;s your tan?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> best sunscreen ever for kids.</li>
    <li> This is okay but feels greasier than I expected so I can&#x27;t use it on my face.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial sunscreen.  Easy to apply, and stays put.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn my boys faces!</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen for all over the kids body. They don&#x27;t mind it at all and its great not to get sunscreen in their eyes.</li>
    <li> very good sunblock, good for sportis, riding a bike, playing football, etc, fast way to wear sunscreen, very helpful.</li>
    <li> We took this on vacation, as it was FAA compliant. It was great, the kids and adults love it.</li>
    <li> Great for carry-on travel when you can&#x27;t bring enough liquid sunscreen through TSA.</li>
    <li> I already loved the regular Beach Defense sunscreen, and the stick is even better! Super fast to put on, isn&#x27;t greasy feeling, and the kids like it as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice for in my purse.</li>
    <li> awesome product and there are no TSA limits, because it is not a liquid!!</li>
    <li> Easy application on our kids and it does its job well!</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Been using for years</li>
    <li> This is the only sunblock I can get my kid to use.  It looks kind of like a deodorant, and it goes on like one, so you don&#x27;t have to get goopy cream on the palm of your hand.  It also holds up better to hot weather than other sunblocks.  It does not have any stinky perfumes in it, and smells faintly of coconuts going on, but can&#x27;t be smelled once its on the skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be as good as the kids wet one.  But it&#x27;s much slimier and makes my face sweat profusely.  I keep it in the car now for back up for my body, but really don&#x27;t like to use it on my face.</li>
    <li> My mom had this at her house this summer and we used it everyday. It is so easy to put on my kids and it doesn&#x27;t sting or get in their eyes. It also is nice because it covers a lot more surface area than the little sticks you can buy. I ordered two of these just to have them around the house and in our pool bag.</li>
    <li> Our family found this product to be way too greasy.  We discarded after two uses.</li>
    <li> Had to travel on an airplane and sunscreen was a need at my destination. Since it was a solid I didn&#x27;t have to include it in my quart size bag. The true bonus was that it wasn&#x27;t overly greasy and it provided great protection.  Very pleased for what I needed it for. Doesn&#x27;t replace my usual sunscreen back home but for traveling on a plane... yeah I would purchase it again!</li>
    <li> Apples very easily, and reapplication is a breeze, too.  It feels smooth, not gritty, going onto the skin. It protects well and never runs into the eyes.  It is the first thing my kids - ages 9 and 5 - reach for.  Why didn&#x27;t someone think of this earlier?!</li>
    <li> glides on nicely, will definitely use this all the time!</li>
    <li> Works great for facial area and the ears. The children love how easy it is to apply.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Lightweight on skin.</li>
    <li> Convient but melts in the sun....</li>
    <li> I love this product, but it&#x27;s small and you can go through it quickly.  Not greasy in m opinon and you have good control over where it applies so nothing gets in your eyes (for example).  I&#x27;m bald so this goes right over the whole head.  If there&#x27;s a little stubble on your face, head or hair on your arms, that&#x27;s where you the product gets thickly dispersed.  It spreads more thinly on smooth skin.  Pleasant fragrance.  Great for one-handed application, which was a big selling point for me (out in a kayak or stand up paddle board, you don&#x27;t want to be unscrewing a cap, squirting out lotion and massaging it in.  Uncap and roll.  For me, a one-handed flip-cap would be even better, but that doesn&#x27;t affect my review since it clearly doesn&#x27;t have that feature.</li>
    <li> Perfect for face, travel companion.</li>
    <li> Put this on in the morning, sit at the beach all day and never re-apply... wonderful stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Airport security friendly as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunblock ever! Very very easy to apply, good smell and very good protection.</li>
    <li> Gave me a terrible rash the first time I used it. Will not be using it again.</li>
    <li> applies quickly and with little mess; but hard to tell if you&#x27;ve covered the area properly and also seems to seal your sweat in or something. Not sure if I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
    <li> My wife and I REALLY like this application - but it&#x27;s still too expensive.  It&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon then anywhere else, but J&amp;J is making a killing on this stuff.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - it goes on smooth, works great as a sunscreen, is gentle to the skin and is SO easy to carry around. I can put it in my purse without worrying about it leaking, meaning that reapplication is easy to do and not as messy. Great to take on vacation - it&#x27;s not a liquid, so packs great for travel!</li>
    <li> Would love to give it no stars! Used it at the beach and my family burned.  In fact, we burned only in the places we used this horrible product. Never again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like use aerosol sunscreen on my daughter (tho I fo sometimes) especially on her face, so this is perfect for my little wiggleworm! She doesn&#x27;t want to sit still and have lotion smeared on her, and she has some mild sensory issues regarding lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not sticky, goes on clear and dries quickly so this does not aggravate her a bit. Best of all it works! Doesn&#x27;t run into her eyes abd definitely protects her from the sun. Application is super fast and easy.</li>
    <li> Good smell and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks because it&#x27;s clear. Much easier to use than lotion and great for traveling since it&#x27;s not a liquid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m delighted to have found this, it is the best sunscreen ever. So easy to apply, it is gentle, smooth, doesn&#x27;t sting, and fragrance is very nice. Thank you, Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> Bald people rejoice.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best sunscreen for your dome.  Not too scented, not oily, and doesn&#x27;t run in your eyes the minute you take a splash to the cabeza.</li>
