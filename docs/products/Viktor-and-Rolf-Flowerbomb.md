<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite perfume at a reasonable price!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love it! Definitely my favorite perfume. Stay longer than other brands.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend since she loves it. She just opened it yesterday and it&#x27;s fake!! DIfferent smell, darker color.. WTF!! WHos responsible for this??</li>
    <li> My mother loved this! She had been wanting this fragrance for a while and the price was the cheapest around. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfume that my sister wanted...haven&#x27;t heard her complain about anything so I assume it&#x27;s good to go.  Man, I hope so cause this stuff is expensive and I found this one that was cheaper than the department store price!</li>
    <li> the product was delivered in three days although I requested the slowest shipping method. It was great</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this perfume last year for $150, so the deal here is great.  And this is now my favorite fragrance!</li>
    <li> I love love love this parfume,I always get compliments  when i wear  it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so beautiful, very feminine!</li>
    <li> Gave it to my girlfriend &amp; she loved it!  Probably a year supply but the price is good for how much she gets &amp; loves it!! Get this size &amp; she&#x27;ll be happy!</li>
    <li> Despite the mixed reviews I went ahead and ordered this for my wife.  I figured the worst that could happen is it turned out to be fake and I would send it back for a refund.  Well as far as either of us can tell it&#x27;s not fake.  The packaging, bottle and contents are the real thing.  Yes, the code is cut out, but so what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was absolutely worth it.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this perfume as a Christmas present for my girl friend.  I had only purchased a 1oz bottle after smelling countless perfumes in a department store.  Well it was a huge success and after she wore it for me for the first time I absolutely loved it on her.  Great light scent, a sweet floral scent is the best way to describe it.  Not overly powerful but very seductive in the way it draws you in.  Plus as a benefit, it doesn&#x27;t seem to transfer, so a nice lingering hug won&#x27;t leave you smelling like your girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with that said when my girl friend ran out of her 1oz bottle I had to go out and purchase her some more, good timing it was her birthday.  So I purchased the 3.4 oz bottle to make sure she had enough to last for a little while.  The price I got was great and the shipping was great as well.</li>
    <li> I have previously  purchased my Flowerbomb at Nordstrom. It smelled wonderful and I always received lots of compliments when I wore it. This new bottle that I purchased through Amazon doesn&#x27;t smell the same. It smells like it sat around too long and got old. I probably shouldn&#x27;t have tried to save money on this product. I still spent $100.00. Oh well, live and learn.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Scentsational\\&quot; I love this scent. It is very sexy. I get a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I have been pining for this perfume for quite some time, so I was elated when I found it on Amazon for $50 less than in department stores.  My husband woke me up on our anniversary morning a couple of weeks ago, and presented me with the 3.4 ounce coveted bottle in it&#x27;s beautiful packaging.  I was not disappointed.  Sometimes in life, you discover the scent that is made for your personality and natural odor, and for me, Flowerbomb is it.  It is my everyday perfume, and how I wear my perfume is simple.  Each morning, after I&#x27;m done showering and drying my hair, but still in the buff, I lift my hair off the back of my neck and from about a 12 inch distance, I hold the bottle behind me and give one full spritz.  This way, the scent is lightly spread partially on my hair and the back of my neck.  As the day goes on, Flowerbomb blends perfectly with my natural scent in a very subtle way.  I don&#x27;t want to leave a scent trail everywhere I walk, but this way, everytime someone gets close enough to me, such as a hug, they get a small dose of an absolutely alluring scent.  For me, this scent is intoxicating and incredibly sexy.</li>
    <li> Overall product was in excellent condition when shipped.  My wife was very happy with the product.  I was very happy with the price as well as the product being delivered when promised.  Would do business with company again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many different perfumes in my life and this one by far is my favorite... My huspand bought it for me for christmas and i have beeen in love with it since. Everyone askes what it is when i&#x27;m wearing it. People stop me and say I smell so good. I absolutley love this perfume. I wish it came in a never ending bottle!</li>
    <li> I got this for my kids to give to their mom for Mother&#x27;s Day. It smells real nice, and turned out to be a great gift.</li>
    <li> Very nice durable and stones stay on surprisingly however I was upset the color was much darker than the image shown.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;secret service codes\\&quot; were cut out. Says it is new, therefore is shouldn&#x27;t have been opened and codes taken out then repackaged.</li>
    <li> I received my bottle yesterday, and it was definitely NOT a knockoff. The smell is fresh and light, and it came correctly packaged and the bottle had no deformities. If you are worried that you received a knockoff, just register your perfume using the number code (located on the top of the perfume box) with the Viktor &amp; Rolf registration site. If it comes back saying that it has no record of the code, then you know you&#x27;ve got a fake. Mine registered just fine.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and my wife has always loved this product and the savings are substantial over purchasing from regular hughstreet retailers</li>
    <li> I got first saw this purfume in Glamour Magazine I believe and it had a free sample in it so I wore it around for a day and thought to myself that I really liked it so I asked for it for christmas. Upon recieveing it for christmas, I fell in love. It lasts forever and I can smell it all day. I wore it to work and by the end of my long day, I STILL smelled it on my sweater! I have never had a purfume that has lasted this long and not to mention the scent it so unique and original.</li>
    <li> First experienced the marvelous scent of Flowerbomb at Nordstroms as a sample.  Loved it, and decided to bring it home.  Lovely, light scent that doesnt easily fade.  Very picky adult daughter is often caught \\&quot;borrowing\\&quot;.  Used Shalimar as my signature scent for years, and have now done a complete turn to Flowerbomb.    Recommended for any intimate gathering, or dinner with someone special.</li>
    <li> Awesome perfume, lasts all day, sweet scent</li>
    <li> Notes:  Sambac Jasmine, Centifolia Rose, Cattleya Orchid, Ballerina Freesia, Patchouli.  Although the name made me almost pass this perfume by, the scent was surprisingly complex. I would describe it as a subtle perfume with \\&quot;warm\\&quot;, sweeter scents and gentle floral notes - more in the gourmand style of perfumes.  This perfume is definitely not overpowering, but is a nice surprise for that special someone leaning in.  The scent does linger on clothing, and seems to last long. I am loving this perfume!</li>
    <li> Just as described and brand new!</li>
    <li> I loved this product! It&#x27;s also more than I expected for the price I paid!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.  It&#x27;s the right scent as I made sure I chose the Parfum vs the eau de toilette.</li>
    <li> My mom loved this for her mothers day gift. She said the smell lasts a really long time, even after she washed her hands. She loves this thing. Kinda pricey though...</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me at Christmas and it has quickly become one of my favorite scents.  Like all perfumes, some will hate this and some will love it. I tend to wear scents according to season and this is perfect for Winter. It&#x27;s not heavy or cloying but it has deep notes. It works well with a vanilla bodyspray (which will help it stay on longer as it does tend to fade pretty quickly) if you want to layer your scents.  The bottle itself is pretty and while it&#x27;s a bit pricey, it&#x27;s almost worth it.  Pros   - Good winter scent - meaning it has deep undertones but light enough to wear everyday.  - Good layering scent  Cons  - You need to spray a few times for it to stay on throughout the day  - Price</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago at SAKS and fell in love with it.  It&#x27;s so fresh and a scent that when you walk by people say, &amp;#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34;.  Love it and still wear it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this perfume for my girlfriend for Valentine&#x27;s day. Expected delivery was on Thursday, 2/16. It came right on time Tuesday, 2/14.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was her first time smelling this perfume, and she fell in love with it. I know it&#x27;s been one of the more popular perfumes for some time, so couldn&#x27;t go wrong with it. Great product, and unbeatable price for the 3.4 oz. size.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get over this scent.  It&#x27;s vanilla deliciousness.  I&#x27;m very picky about my perfumes, but my boyfriend discovered this one for me, and we both absolutely love it.  It doesn&#x27;t have the floral or chemical scent that a lot of perfumes have.</li>
    <li> My wifes (and mine) favorite!  Bar none!  Perfect - not too strong or weak, not too perfumey!..I buy a lot of expensive perfumes for my wife.  This is our absolute favorite!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> i love this perfume. it is lasting and has a great sweetish flower smell. It is not over powering and I get compliments on it every time i wear it. I got it for abt $50 less on amazon so I was extremely happy. :)</li>
    <li> The code is missing. The smell is diluted. FAKE, FAKE, FAKE.</li>
    <li> This is the best scent I have been able to find in years.  I would give it a 5, but it still is overpriced and the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as some of my other perfumes. When going out, I have to take it with me and spray on right before I go in to wherever I am going.  However...I was able to find the best price on Amazon.com with a good saving. I always check Amazon for best pricing on ALL of my purchases.</li>
    <li> If you like SEXY this scent is for you... I get compliments every day I am using it! I have already gotten 10 of my coworkers on board :) It&#x27;s that good! It&#x27;s a sweet musk scent with notes of flowers - delicately mixed. My Fav!!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enouph when it comes to describing how delicious this perfume smells!!!!  since buying the perfume I have also bought the lotion and hair mist! The only negative is the smell doesn&#x27;t really last as long as I would like it too :(  but, I will buy it again, lol  I guess I could always try wearing more when I first put it on.</li>
    <li> Wonderful to wear year round!</li>
    <li> This is my 4th bottle. My fav of all. Get many compliments!!!</li>
    <li> This was to replace a bottle my wife already used. Great scent.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. Not my favorite, but it&#x27;s not bad. Smells a little like Lolita, but spicy, less sweet.</li>
    <li> My wife was surprised that she got 3oz! Being a guy I didn&#x27;t know that 3oz of perfume is too much but I didn&#x27;t get many complaints. My advice is take a look online at the prices for certain amounts and you will agree that the price on Amazon (and by this seller) is the best online.</li>
    <li> The Viktor &amp; Rolf secret code that is supposed to verify the authenticity is scratched off with a razor blade! Now how am I supposed to spend this type of money and still not know if my product is %100 legit! This is the most ridiculous thing ever!</li>
    <li> I have always loved this scent and was overjoyed to finally find a large bottle of it for such a great price. Very Good product, smells very sophisticated and warm combined.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is good but NOT long lasting.</li>
    <li> Definitely an outstanding value.  Made great stocking stuffer for wife.</li>
    <li> do not buy this product from here it is definetely fake .i have been using flower bomb for years now ,so i ordered two bottles .but i knew once i received the package they perfume were fake ,smelled them it was pure alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;do not waste your money ordering them from here ,buy only from  sephora or departement store.</li>
    <li> smells fantastic. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product or better service .</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product 0 stars. This is totally fake, do not order it. The code on inside of package has been removed. And the product is not the correct color.</li>
    <li> Am in love with this perfume , got it twice before in Sephora &amp; Macys ...how do i make sure this is an original flowerbomb before buying it since this is not refundable ....can&#x27;t find contact us on the product??</li>
    <li> This perfume is an obvious knockoff. The decal on the bottle is cheap and the scent of the perfume is very weak. It has been watered down. This is not the original Flowerbomb!</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  Everytime i wear it, someone asks what I&#x27;m wearing and tells me i smell great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely  love this scent! I get tims of compliments!</li>
    <li> Exactly was advertised.  Would order again</li>
    <li> Got this item as a gift for my wife.  She absolutely loves it.  Recommend the bigger bottle, as it is a better cost per oz. than its smaller counterpart.</li>
    <li> Expense stuff so of course the wife loves it. 3.4oz bottle so at least this is the most economic way to purchase!</li>
    <li> This is my very favorite perfume....I love it.  But I really believe this product is OLD, the color is dark &amp; it smells not like it should.  If I can find my paperwork I am going to try to send it back, for $99.00 is was no bargain, like I thought it would be.  I should had known, when I opened the perfume box, the inner box was torn &amp; the perfume bottle was sideways,  like it was opened &amp; sent back previously...so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my wife wanted.  I actually like this parfume as well,  Well balanced flower smell, quire unique compared to all others out there.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this fragrance and I don&#x27;t mind it either. The packaging was excellent and if you mail in the registration form (don&#x27;t use the website option) they will send you free samples. My wife loved that too. This was also my first \\&quot;Amazon Marketplace\\&quot; purchase and that too was great. I will buy from Amazon Marketplace merchants again.</li>
    <li> This is the very first perfume in all my 54 years that constantly brings a smile to my face.  My hubs loves the fragrance on me, and is always telling me how great I smell.  Co-workers comment on it all the time, too.  Seriously, this is wonderful.  It is my new signature.  You have to love the price on amazon too!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and we both love it.  She wears it when we go out and she really likes it, and I love the way it smells on her.  Great perfume.</li>
    <li> Did not like from the first spray.  I wore it out and my sister made the comment that someone was wearing old lady perfume.</li>
    <li> I can not pin point it but the perfume does not smell the same as the one I purchase at the store</li>
    <li> money is not everything and i am happy not having much, but if i did, i would have stock in this company b/c i would buy so much.  EVERYONE that comes near me when i wear it tells me how good i smell and i love smelling it too!  my husband sure doesn&#x27;t mind it either!</li>
    <li> I was very please with my order it arrived ahead of schedule and was in excellent shape when it arrived. I have used this perfume for about 2 years and the price was very good. It was a very easy process and I was pleased with my service.&#x27;</li>
    <li> The fragrance is amazing!  I wore it for a week straight and received so many comments from men and women. This will be my new favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> My best perfume in a long time.  I bought the 100 ml (3.4 oz) bottle and it&#x27;s fairly strong so two spritzes does it and it lasts.  One to the wrists one to the neck.  Thank you Viktor&amp;Rolf for my new, a little pricey scent.  I paid $98 shipped w/tax from one of the Amazon vendors.  Not a bad deal.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this fragrance. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous buying this because of the reviews stating that it was fake. I bought it anyway anf it&#x27;s definitely real. I had a sample from the store and they smell the exact same. I love this perfume and receive so many compliments when I wear it. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> these days, everyone who has a recognizable face, or any other body part for that matter, hehe, launches a perfume line, and they stink as much as their talents do.. this is a great one.</li>
    <li> Smell incredible. My wife and I love it.</li>
    <li> I think the product is great,  The seller got the product to me in timely fashion.  I would recommend to a friend and will order again if the product is available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Fowerbomb since it was launched and absolutely love it! It also happens to be my boyfriends favourite too! I travel internationally for work a lot and normally buy most of my fragrances and cosmetics in duty free because until recently it&#x27;s been the cheapest place to purchase such items. Lately I&#x27;ve found much better deals on Amazon than what I pay for in duty free.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!  I get so many compliments, no headache, and I absolutely have no regrets getting it.</li>
    <li> Just what the name says, it&#x27;s all that and more !!! It is the Bomb ladies you cannot go wrong with this, your man, husband, special freind will love it on you</li>
    <li> This perfume smells awesome...LOVE IT! Scent is not overwhelming and last forever :) so happy I ordered it well worth the $</li>
    <li> I love my Flowerbomb perfume; however, this bottle is only about half used and it has decided to quit spraying.  Not sure what the problem is.  It sprays when it wants to, but never when I need for it to.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this fragrance for quite awhile and hated to spend the money.  I shop at a large department store who offers coupons once a year that are good on cosmetics and fragrance, but they don&#x27;t carry this line by Viktor &amp; Rolf.  I was so excited when I saw that Amazon carried it, and at a tremendous savings, so I purchased the largest bottle available!  Wow-happy, happy, happy!</li>
    <li> First smelled this fragrance on a cruise ship in December 2013.  It was awesome and a little squirt lasted the entire evening.  In fact, each night on my way down to the dining room, I stopped in the store and tested it again.  As soon as I came home, I ordered it on Amazon.  Of course, like the rest of us shoppers, I opted for the lowest price.  It came from some wholesale company in California.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it.  Well, it did not smell same and you need to spray 1/2 of a bottle to get any scent.  You may expect that with the low-end perfumes, but for over $100.00/bottle, you know you should easily be smelling it.  My only thought is that it sat on a shelf in the wholesale store for years and lost it&#x27;s fragrance.  Next time, I will not by from that distributor!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this is still happening! Mine came with the code removed and the perfume smelled like alcohol. Amazon is correcting the problem but I think next time I&#x27;ll go back to Nordstrom&#x27;s or Duty Free (at the airport) to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it has a lot to do with this particular fragrance. The first bottle I bought never showed up and now the second is a fake. The third one better be good...</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Someone smells amazing&amp;#34; is commonly uttered when I am wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite response is to say &amp;#34;Vince (my boyfriend) wears Flowerbomb&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He turns red, everyone laughs, and I share that it&#x27;s way cheaper to buy on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time.  So beautiful, and unique- a mix of musk and floral that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Not good at all! It&#x27;s a fake one.... I have to spray it every 1/2 an hour so I can smell like something.... Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I am not sure that this is a quality product. I feel like it might be a diluted perfume as I have noticed the fragrance dissipates very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used Flowerbomb for YEARS, and I can guarantee you this is not the real thing. The fragrance barely last 2 minutes, and even when you spray it, it does not smell the same. I think its better to save your money, and buy the real one at a store.</li>
    <li> this smells awesome remains for a long time. long time is many days not just whole day....n i mean it...even after laundry...</li>
    <li> My wife loves it so much and if she is happy, I am happy.  What else can&#x27;t I say except to avoid those ladies at the department store trying to spray the testers on your wife. lol</li>
    <li> Timely delivery, smells great. Love it!</li>
    <li> According  to my girlfriend this fragrance meet her expectations.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I love the fragrance and I was happy with the price. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> This quickly became my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; perfume. There is never a day I do not feel elegant when wearing this. I use it lightly to ensure it will not be over-powering. I have had women and men comment. When they did this early on I would quickly ask &amp;#34;Oh, too strong?&amp;#34;  The reply was always the same, &amp;#34;No, just right!&amp;#34; This is an absolutely beautiful fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells just great. This on Amazon is a great value for sure. I was trying to get it at the store and it was twice as much. Buy here and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received the Flowerbomb by Viktor &amp; Rolf for Women, Eau de Parfum, 3.4 Ounce Spray on time, however it was missing the &amp;#34;unique code&amp;#34; for the secret service benefits (required to sign up for special benefits on the MFGs website). When I received the gift, the exterior plastic wrap was open on one end. I taped it closed and didn&#x27;t think anything about it until my wife tried to enroll to receive the secret service benefits and found the &amp;#34;unique code&amp;#34; noticeably  removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;unique code&amp;#34; appears to have been removed from inside the box along with something else that was fastened to one of the sides in the box, like a card or special instructions. I contacted the seller and asked them why someone  would open the box prior to shipping and remove these items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfume Outlet Inc&#x27;s customer service offered a complete refund but no replacement,  which didn&#x27;t leave me with a warm and fuzzy feeling. Kind of like take it or leave it because we won&#x27;t fix it.  Perfume Outlet Inc said they had no more in stock but Amazon had 3 in inventory this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve contacted Viktor &amp; Rolf for a resolution as I try to figure out where the market for stolen &amp;#34;unique codes&amp;#34; came from. -1 star for my time and -2 stars for deceptive  trade practices. Otherwise a 5 star item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was competitively priced and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent...nothing comes close to this perfume.  For years I&#x27;ve been addicted to Juicy Couture and D&amp;G Light Blue and I knew I loved this scent but thought it was too pricey.  Now that I have it, the money was well worth it!  Most perfumes will wear off by the end of the day or even midday.  Honestly,  I will put one spray on before work and still smell the remnants the next morning!  Everyone has given me so many compliments on it and I&#x27;m more than happy to tell them about Flowerbomb.  AND this is the first time ever I&#x27;m writing a review on ANYTHING I&#x27;ve ever purchased, because I&#x27;m truly amazed by this product.  Well done V&amp;R!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, is what it is supposed to be, no complaints, mild and floral.</li>
    <li> If you like Flowerbomb, this is a great value!!  I have paid the same price for 1/2 that amount in stores.</li>
    <li> Yummy! Love the smell.</li>
    <li> Sexy, beautiful scent. I&#x27;ll admit when I first got it I hated it. I thought it was so strong! I threw it in my junk drawer. I decided to give it another try. The first time I sprayed.a few sprays on each arm. Way too much. This is a powerful scent. A little goes a long way!! I put one spray on each arm and rubbed together. This scents lasts all day. It goes on very floraly. Then as the day goes on it gets almost powdery. But not like a sickenly baby powder scent. Sexy powdery. Kind of creamy. It&#x27;s just delicious. I adore it now and am so glad I decided to give it another try.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite parfum and the price was better than in stores</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for my wife for carrying and delivering our little baby girl.  It&#x27;s her favorite fragrance and Amazon by far had the cheapest price for this size.  The packaging was great, delivery was prompt and I scored big points with the wifey.  Love that.</li>
    <li> Sorry Amazon, but after reading the many reviews claiming that they received knock-off perfum  of Flower Bomb, it scared me away from ordering this much wanted perfum here.  As a result, I ended up going to Macy&#x27;s.com.  I am happy to say, that, yes the lot numbers matched the bottle and box, and the perfume is exactly as I expected it to be.  It is full bodied with a wonderful flowery and yes long lasting fragrance.  I put it on in the morning and can still smell it in the evening.  For those of you who don&#x27;t like a sweet perfume this may not be for you.  It is sweet, however, as one other reviewer said, it isn&#x27;t the sweet smell of an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; perfume, which is cloying and almost gagging to smell.  But never the less, it is a powerful fragrance.  One that doesn&#x27;t need to be used liberally, unless you want people to know your walking down the street from 100 feet away.  A light touch is all that is needed.  I am very happy with it.  Usually I do choose a less sweet fragrance, more on the citrus side, but this is such an unusual fragrance to me, that the first time I smelled it in Vogue, I knew I just had to have it.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend, she absolutely loves it.  A better price here than at the department store.  I like the smell too. Not overpowering, smells great.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. Get compliment from others when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and in nice box. Smells great and my wife loves it</li>
    <li> I love it!  Smells fantastic to me, and got a sample of the guy&#x27;s version &amp;#34;spicebomb&amp;#34; in the mail, and am ordering for my 15 yr old son... he really likes it.  Never heard of Viktor and Rolf and don&#x27;t wear much perfume, but love sweet, and this is just yummy!!</li>
    <li> HE EAU DE PARFUM DOES NOT GOT THE FRAGRANCE OF THE BRAND.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD LIKE A FULL REFUND UPON RETURN OR INSTRUCTIONS FOR IT.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells nice but it is very strong. One spray. I gave it to my sister who loved it more than I. It overtakes the smell of all the perfumes on my table. I set the bottle in the kitchen and went to work, when I came back the whole house smelled of it. I have to put it back in its box and set aside. Over powering fragrance. If you are going out amongst a large crowd or working out and want to stay smelling good, this is the best. Smells great.</li>
    <li> The perfume arrived and the box was pretty beat up and the bottle was dancing inside the box. My wife had another bottle to compare the scent and the quality of the bottle. The smell was spot on and the quality of the bottle matched the old bottle she was replacing. I wonder if the discounted price has something to do with the condition of the box. The condition of the box bothered me because this was a gift. I don&#x27;t like giving gifts that look like it had been in Brazil and was kicked around the soccer field for 90 minutes during a World Cup match. Anyhow, if the smell is what you&#x27;re after, go ahead and buy it. If this is going to be a gift, buy some scotch tape to fix the box when it arrives and apologize to the recipient for the appearance of their gift.</li>
    <li> Did like the product. Smells good and I love it.... I will buy it again. All day long smell and fresh.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother on her birthday and she will not ware anything else. This has become one of her favorites perfumes ever, And she has had many befrore this one. This has to top all perfumes.</li>
    <li> My second bottle. Great fragrance!</li>
    <li> wife loves this stuff and it smells great on her.</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume that I have ever had.  I have been wearing this scent since it came on the market.  I never fail to get compliments when wearing it.  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  Everyone compliments me when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I fell in love at first scent! I will buy this again its lovely!</li>
    <li> I really would like a refund for this product, I tried the flowerbomb at Nordstrom and liked it, The one I received from Amazon does not smell the same and the cap doesn&#x27;t fit right and the small black circle on the bottle does not have the flower on it. I have thrown the box away but I would like a refund. This purfume definately does not meet the standards of the one I tried at Nordstrom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you,&lt;br /&gt;Shelly Olson</li>
    <li> This perfume is absolutely sublime and unlike anything else out there. It&#x27;s classy, feminine, floral yet clean smelling. I got it as a gift for my mom after she smelled a sample insert in a magazine, but seriously wish I could have kept it for myself! She is in love with the fragrance, and my dad who is super picky about smells actually loves it too!</li>
    <li> I read lots of bad reviews on this saying it was a fake ect but it isn&#x27;t. Perfect product. Smells amazing. Is not a fake. The code in the box was missing which was a little weird but everything else seemed legit</li>
    <li> My daughter liked the smell of this perfume. So my husband and I bought her some for her birthday. And she absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised, very please.</li>
    <li> I saw this perfume at the mall and was shocked when they wanted one hundred and sixty dollars for it! I looked it up on Amazon and found it at a reasonable price, so I ordered it! I always get compliments on this perfume.</li>
    <li> No it didn&#x27;t I give it a 0</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for Christmas and she loved it. For the size of the bottle and the price at the time . The bottle was a good price and a good deal. I would only buy this item near black friday.</li>
    <li> Well it appears that its somehow been tampered with. The box had been opened prior to when I received it and some markings or labeling had been sliced out with near surgeon like precision, almost. I could tell someone had used an exacto razor knife to remove something from two or three different places on the viktor&amp;rolf box. Plus the perfume seems to be a bit watery in comparison to any other bottle of flowerbomb I&#x27;ve used or had. I cannot smell it on my skin for very long after I first apply it. I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is but I will not be ordering ANYTHING from this supplier in the future.</li>
    <li> Will never perfume online again. This smelled nothing like the actual fragrance.  The packaging was undone. The cellophane was loose. It was obvious it had been tampered with.</li>
    <li> I adore Flowerbomb as a daytime scent, especially in the summer. While overly perky floral is the first thought the name invokes, and this scent is actually sophisticated and quite light if you only use one spritz. (Using more can push it up in the really floral category.)    I really feel like this scent is a great pick me up - one sniff of the wrist while you&#x27;re wearing it and I guarantee your mood will brighten. The pink crystal grenade bottle also makes me smile each time I see it.    As a point of reference, my other preferred scents are Burberry Brit Sheer for day and Marc Jacobs Lola for night.</li>
    <li> This is my daughters favorite perfume and I really wanted to get her some for her college graduation, she had it on her Christmas wishlist and I couldn&#x27;t afford it then.  I wish I had looked on Amazon - since this is the LARGE bottle and it is the PERFUME, not the &#x27;EDtoilet&#x27;... yet it is priced almost the same as the EDT... I was totally expecting it to not really be the perfume, but was pleasantly surprised.  AMAZINGLY GREAT DEAL!</li>
    <li> I simply love this perfume. And I purchased at Amazon for $111, as opposed to $150 retail price. Great savings! Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I seldom like a floral fragrance.  However, one of my magazines had a sample strip of this and I adored it.  Since I wasn&#x27;t able to find it close to home, I took the plunge and ordered from Amazon.  When in doubt, check out Amazon appears to be my mantra.  This fragrance isn&#x27;t heavy or overwhelming or too sugary sweet.  It&#x27;s soft, feminine, and you have to be relatively close for it to be noticed.  It has become my go-to and I&#x27;ll definitely be reordering.  I should probably go for the body lotion since layering generally makes fragrances last longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never buy anything else for my wife.</li>
    <li> Counterfeit, black market product.  Smells more like alcohol than Flower Bomb.  Compared it to the REAL Flower Bomb that I have and smells nothing like it, I want a refund!</li>
    <li> Just got mine. Yes the code inside the box was cut out but I put it next to my old bottle that still has some perfume left in it and the color is the same and so is the smell. It also stays on just as long. If it is a knock off, it&#x27;s a great one!</li>
    <li> Love it.. my favorite one....</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift, and the recipient was thrilled!  Great value and great price.  This is the big bottle.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loved it, which means I love it.  This was not a knock off according to her and she knows.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s overpriced originally. I like it but would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I wear this perfume almost every day. It is my favorite, and I have gotten many compliments. It is floral and romantic, and age appropriate (I&#x27;m 26). It&#x27;s also not overly common, so it&#x27;s usually a signature scent.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend and I love this perfume.</li>
    <li> I received my shipment in just a couple of days. For the price, it was well worth it !!! I get compliments, on the scent and my boss was mad, I didn&#x27;t order her a bottle too !!! I rate it 5 stars .</li>
    <li> If you have never smelled Victor and Rolf I suggest you do this smell is like going out in a beautiful summer garden without the overpowering smell you get with most floral scents,it&#x27;s absolutely my favorite and the price is just wonderfully unbeatable will buy it again as gifts.</li>
    <li> Just as I have hoped for</li>
    <li> this perfurme spells sooooo good on my girlfriend. She loves it and I love it on her def a great buy</li>
    <li> Perfumes are obviously such a personal choice, so get out to a department store and test it out for yourself.  This review is about the price. I love a good deal and hunt for a long time before I buy anything to make sure I get THE best deal.  Amazon has the best deals out there for V&amp;R perfume. This is your last stop.</li>
    <li> My wife has worn this scent for years and we have extra bottles at home. I got this for her and when it arrived it is a fake horrible knock off!!! The bottle is close but wrong. The metal label is glued on loosely and crooked. The pump spray is cheap and weak, and the perfume color is wrong and scent is wrong!! Beware do not buy this from this retailer! We still have the perfume we haven&#x27;t returned it yet. But we will and we want our money back. I have never returned anything on amazon, but I have heard it is easy. We like Amazon and will continue to shop here but not from this particular perfume retailer.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, as it was a gift.  Good price, quick shipment, no complaints here.  Happy wife, happy life. :D</li>
    <li> Great price for an expensive perfume. Was wrapped in plastic and was just perfect!! Would order again from the ppl</li>
    <li> The most lovely fragrance EVER....lingers throughout the day I cannot say enough...FLOWERBOMB is da BOMB!!!! One four ounce bottle lasts me amost 8 mos which is another plus and yes I wear it everyday!</li>
    <li> Best perfume EVER.  I will always wear this scent.  Super sexy yet fresh.  Its totally worth the price! I got the 3.4oz for 100 $ on amazon Very good price!</li>
    <li> Excellent. All ways a hit. Always makes other co workers say.&amp;#34; Who smells good&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Always fast shipping. Excellent product well worth the price</li>
    <li> Another win for me!  My wife loves it!  I dun good!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and then bought one at sephora. The one that I ordered from Amazon was definitely a fake. Do not buy!! It does not smell as good as the real one, at all.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item prior to reading the reviews.  After reading the reviews I was slightly worried but double checked to make sure that Amazon, LLC was fulfilling the order....they were, so I felt like it should be fine, as I&#x27;ve never had a problem with anything I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon before. The package arrived in a box that was not the normal Amazon box (w/ the smile.)  When I opened the box, it was VERY CLEAR that the actual product box had been tampered with.  Just like the others, the box was slightly bent, the bottle rolling around freely inside, the security code had been cut off.  I did not open the packaging right away.  I just went ahead and called Amazon to request a refund.  They refunded me without question.  I am very pleased with how Amazon handled it, although I really hope they can investigate these cases, somehow. Amazon told me not to return the item to them, due to some kind of chemical laws.  I wanted to open it and compare it to the real thing, so I went to my local Sephora store, got a sample of Flowerbomb, gathered 5 of my friends and sprayed the one from Sephora on one wrist and the one from Amazon on the other wrist and let them all see if they could tell a difference.  They, unanamously, agreed that the one I purchased from Amazon was different and smelled very strongly of alcohol.....not the rich, warm smells of the real Flowerbomb on my other wrist.  Lesson learned???  Don&#x27;t try to get a deal on designer perfume!!!  Just go ahead and pay full price and know that you&#x27;re getting the actual product that you love!!!</li>
    <li> I like stronger perfumes and I must say that this scent definitely matches my expectations of what a perfume should smell like.&lt;br /&gt;I first sprayed it on a piece of paper and liked the smell. I also sprayed some on my wrist.&lt;br /&gt;After I came home, I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my wrist...because it smelled so good!!! It definitely smells much better on the skin than a piece of paper they use&lt;br /&gt;to spray on testers. This perfume is really expensive... and I compare it to one of my favourite perfumes YSL Parisienne.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> People comment and compliment me all the time when I were this cologne.  I totally love it and it is my all time favorite.  I will certainly buy more....quick delivery and no hassle.  thank you</li>
    <li> After reading a few reviews I was very concerned to buy this product through amazon. I even went as far as to try and cancel my order after seeing reviews saying that the product was a fake. I can say with certainty that this is not a fake! I researched this perfume in stores quite a bit before buying it, and was familiar with how strong it is and how long it should last. The bottle I received was just as good as what I tried out in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell, I love it. I&#x27;m 19 years old and wanted something that was still young, but a tiny bit more mature. This scent gives you that. It is something I would also feel comfortable wearing year round. Before I got this perfume, I wore Chanel Coco Mme on a daily basis, in case that helps anybody looking to buy this. They are not the same, but I would say a lot of the same people would like both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I STRONGLY recommend this. It&#x27;s a great floral that isn&#x27;t too sweet, and isn&#x27;t too tough!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, my wife loves it</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It&#x27;s sweet and feminine. People always ask what I&#x27;m wearing when I have this one on.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in time promised.  However, it seemed off color and not the actual perfume.  The color is very gold and not petal pink.  I wear this all the time and the smell of this purchase seems old or stagnant.  Not pleased.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS ITEM!!!</li>
    <li> When I wear Flowerbomb, I always get complemented on the fragrance.  It has a combination of smells that is its own.  Proud to wear Flowerbomb by Viktor &amp; Rolf.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this perfume. Locally the small bottle was only a few dollars less than Amazon sold this much larger one (double the size) for. Great deal.</li>
    <li> Fake.  Can&#x27;t believe this listing is still active.</li>
    <li> Buy it every year - my daughter&#x27;s absolute favorite!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This review is by my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent not overpowering. Very satisfied with my purchase. It gets four out of five stars because the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> THIS IS COUNTERFEIT. DO NOT BUY THIS PERFUME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you receive will not be Flowerbomb, but a knock-off. Upon opening the box, my girlfriend noticed it looked fairly beat up but thought at first that it could have been due to shipping. What we discovered upon looking closer was that the Secret Service code that comes with each bottle of perfume had been sloppily razored off the package, as well as two other strips down the inside of the box. Additionally, the beat up look to the box was due to the fact that it had been completely ripped open (its made out of one piece of cardboard that is fastened with glue on one side) and then hot glued back together, although whomever glued it made a mess out of it and left drizzles of glue all over the inside, as well as fingerprints on the pearlescent outside of the box. The perfume wasn&#x27;t supported like it normally is either, it was rolling around freely in a crushed version of the pink cardboard that normally suspends it, so the black Vicktor&amp;Rolph marker was bent. The scent of the perfume was the last straw - she put some of her previous bottle of Flowerbomb perfume (purchased at Sephora) on one wrist and then some from this bottle on her other wrist. After a few minutes, the difference was clear - the counterfeit smells similar, but lacks the sweet, smokey undertones of the real deal.  My girlfriend was so excited to find this perfume at a discount - clearly, this is why.</li>
    <li> I received the product to find the packaging had been opened and re-packaged, in order to insert a knock off of the product ordered.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume is not the product as described, the fragrance is that of a cheap perfume, and Amazon will not allow it to be returned.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000P20U7G Flowerbomb by Viktor &amp; Rolf for Women - 3.4 Ounce EDP Spray]]&lt;br /&gt;I have been ripped-off!</li>
    <li> I received my perfume today and am very satisfied. Some of the previous Amazon reviews concerned me, but my package arrived and everything was in tact. The perfume is authentic, not a knockoff. I compared it to the sample I received from Nordstroms. The only thing missing was the sticker inside of the box, so I won&#x27;t receive any promotional material. But this isn&#x27;t a huge concern being that I saved over $50.00. So pleased!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law LOVES this cologne but can&#x27;t afford it, so I give it to her every year for her birthday. It&#x27;s a nice way to give what she can&#x27;t afford, and it makes me feel good to be able to do it.</li>
    <li> I Love this perfume and this particular bottle is PERFECT!  It was packaged well and there is nothing negative to say :)</li>
    <li> I got this as a stocking stuffer... She mostly like the way the bottle looked online but not that she has it she loves the way it smells too...</li>
    <li> I had reservations about purchasing this product, but must say that I was delighted with what I received. It was a holiday gift for my daughter. The packaging came in perfect condition, the bottle is beautiful and the perfume smells great. It&#x27; s everything that I expected for a high end perfume. Very satisfied with Flowerbomb!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time for Christmas and we a fair value...easy ordering. Good experience.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t give feedback as it is a Christmas gift</li>
    <li> Fake! Fake! Fake.Thought it would be safer ordering from Amazon.com as the shipper. However this perfume is a complete fake! I have the real flower bomb bought from Sephora, this perfume does not smell the same and does not last like the real flowerbomb. The real flowerbomb I would give five stars. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for the last year and the real thing is fantastic! I&#x27;ve contacted customer service and I hope for a Full refund since they won&#x27;t allow me to ship it back do to &amp;#34;special handling&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very good product and price , thanks</li>
    <li> It was great all the way around</li>
    <li> The customer service rep sent me a replacement for a counterfeit unit, and the replacement was also counterfeit. Getting refund. I told the 2nd cust serv rep to take item off website and investigate all stock. It is easy to tell when perfume is fake. The &amp;#34;authenticity code&amp;#34; that is normally on inside on box&#x27;s top when you open it up is cut out, apparently with something like an exacto knife. Also, the smell is nothing like the real stuff, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bet, based on all the other reviews with similar experiences, that Amazon will continue selling this fake item.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed perfume smells rancid.  When compared to department store the perfume does not smell the same.  A big disappointment</li>
    <li> I would NOT recommend buying this product! The barcodes are cut off and stickers are placed over some of them. The perfume was loose in the box when I received it and looked like it had been repackaged (the cardboard was bent in odd places and the clear wrap was already coming off). The scent does not last as long when compared to the &#x27;same&#x27; perfume at Nordstrom, it smells different by the end of the day and is more sugary than flowery. It&#x27;s disappointing to see that Amazon would sell something that isn&#x27;t real, but they definitely did. If you want this perfume, definitely buy it from an authorized dealer such as Nordstrom or Sephora. Nordstrom will even match the Amazon price. DO NOT BUY IT ON AMAZON.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so expensive at $80.00 + tax for the 1.0z bottle (I hope I never run out of this stuff because it&#x27;s the most expensive perfume I&#x27;ve ever bought) but it smells amazing! And while I probably could&#x27;ve found it a bit cheaper online I didn&#x27;t wanna risk getting a fake or stale product and not being able to return it. I always trust the department stores for high end products. Anyway, I am so in love with this fragrance! Viktor &amp; Rolf&#x27;s \\&quot;Flowerbomb\\&quot;, Katy Perry&#x27;s \\&quot;Killer Queen\\&quot;, Juicy Couture&#x27;s \\&quot;Viva La Juicy\\&quot; and Beyonce&#x27;s \\&quot;Pulse\\&quot; are my signature fragrances!</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful - I&#x27;m asked often what I&#x27;m wearing which is nice.  I switch daily fragrances and always wear the accompanying lotion as well - it is a great scent!</li>
    <li> this seller its not good.  I just got mine and its not the real thing. i used to have one i got in saks and it will stay in my skin till the next moring. now this one it doesnt smell 5 minutes after i spray it</li>
    <li> My wife loved it. I received it fast and undamaged.</li>
    <li> What a deal.  In the stores this sells for a lot more.  Love amazon.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfum! It is genuine, but the packaging has been tampered with. The &amp;#34;Victor &amp; Rolf Secret Service Codes&amp;#34; have been cut out of the box. I was disappointed since those codes help you earn points for this premium perfume. I felt cheated.  Other than that, it smells genuine and the packaging looks like retail packaging.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY FAKE. It is WAY darker than the actual flower bomb and the smell is NOT the same. It seems to be watered down/mixed with some other spicy/cheap kind of perfume. The packaging was destroyed. On the black flower attached to the bottle, there is no symbol that is on the actual flower bomb. Also- the front label that says &amp;#34;Flowerbomb&amp;#34; is a sticker...came right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS ITEM ONCE YOU PURCHASE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for years and noticed it fake immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I google searched the address I received it from on google maps. When looking at the street view, it is some run down building, not &amp;#34;Lina Makeup.&amp;#34; In fact if you try and find Lina Makeup there is no such thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS***********</li>
    <li> This is not the real Flowerbomb.  I was however, refunded my money.  It arrived with the plastic open on the box and the color is more amber than pink.  The real Flowerbomb is a light pink in color.  It smells very little like the real thing.  The fragrance is not bad, but not near as good as the good stuff!  Take my advice and invest in the real thing.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised, no problems at all.  Shop with confidence.</li>
    <li> I bought Flowerbomb because a co-worker was wearing it and she smelled so good.  The fragrance reminds me of soft powder and not over powering.  I also bought the same parfum for my daughter and every time she wears it, I love the softness of the parfum.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT WAS NOT AS PICTURED.</li>
    <li> I love this eau de parfum and have used it for years.  I get many compliments on the scent.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and I couldn&#x27;t be anymore happier made the right choice. This was at a great price I couldn&#x27;t get it from any place else.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume my daughter will wear.  She has worn it for about 5 years now.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. Every time I am out people ask me what kind of perfume I am wearing. I am a walking advertisement for flower bomb. I will wear this perfume until they quit making it.</li>
    <li> When the item arrived, it was wrapped &amp; sealed in cellophane, just as if I had purchased in store. Upon opening, there was a small 1.5 inch pamphlet notifying the purchaser there is a V&amp;R club. If you go to their website and enter the number provided on the flap of the box (marked with arrows), you can enter for specials, etc. I opened the box, lifted the flap only to find the number had been &amp;#34;surgically&amp;#34; removed by finely cutting it out, not damaging the other side of the flap. In other words, very sneeky! This has really bothered my and has caused me to questions what else has been &amp;#34;modified&amp;#34; with the perfume itself. This product was sold through Amazon directly which leads me to believe &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; are the ones who unwrapped the original box, removed the numbers and they very discretely re-wrapped the cellophane. I now question the quality of the perfume, has it been tampered with also??? Trust me, I will NEVER again purchase this $130 perfume from Amazon, only from a reputable department store, In the long run, not worth the cost difference if I will be wondering if I truly purchased Flowerbomb, in it&#x27;s original state. This is a fragrance I love, wear it EVERY day. So long Amazon, and SHAME ON YOU!!!</li>
    <li> The smell of this spray is wonderful. It&#x27;s a delicate flower smell and wears very well.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered Flowerbomb 3.4 Ounce EDP Spray from Amazon (not from one of the 3rd venders), and it was an obvious counterfeit.  My wife has been using this perfume and still has the old bottle.  The one we received from Amazon does not smell the same, and the bottle is in lower quality.  For example, the surface of the cap is concaved as if it was cheaply molded while the cap of the real one has a smooth, flat surface.  There are some other details which are different from the real one.  Great as always, Amazon refunded me the purchase price.  Amazon also agreed that they would need to run some investigation on their inventory and supplier.</li>
    <li> At the opera this evening I sat next to a woman wearing a scent so overpowering it made my eyes water and my throat burn.  I&#x27;d never had such a reaction to a scent before and so, at the end of the performance, I asked her what she was wearing.  Her embarrassed answer: Flowerbomb.</li>
    <li> This is a fake one confirmed!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love it!! Great deal too :)</li>
    <li> Every thing was perfect</li>
    <li> Great perfume!! I received it for Christmas and have worn it everyday sense. Perfect if you like that floral soft scent.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this one.</li>
    <li> There was a gift code that was removed from the box.  The Gift was a birthday present.  My wife spent a hour trying to find the code.  The box was tampered with prior to opening.  The perfume was nice.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  It is not too heavy or overpowering but still really smells good.  I try to be considerate of those with allergies and not wear really strong scents and this one seems like the answer to me.</li>
    <li> I sampled this fragrance at Sephora and loved it.  I decided to check price on Amazon and was thrilled to see price was about 50% less than Sephora&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m a prime member It arrived very quickly as promised, and the perfume packaging was secure and packaged exactly as if you purchased the fragrance at a retail store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this fragrance!</li>
    <li> a drop  goes a long way....to add more &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; to the aroma, i put a little bit of baby oil on my skin prior to putting on FB.  then the perfume lasts longer b/c it absorbs more of the scent...just a little trick</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, have been wearing it for about two years now. I discovered it from one of those perfume inserts inside a  magazine.&lt;br /&gt;Inside the package was a flyer that said to go to their website, enter the code from inside the top flap of the box, for special gifts, offers, etc. from Victor &amp; Rolf. Someone had already opened my box, removed the code (looks like they took a razor and cut out the paper from the lid where the code was supposed to be,) then re-sealed the box.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why someone would take the time to do that, but other than that, the perfume itself is fine.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing! It&#x27;s a very sexy scent. I get compliments on it all the time. I bought the smaller roller ball at first, but needed much more. I won&#x27;t be changing my scent for a long time. It&#x27;s too delicious!</li>
    <li> my daughter was thrilled when she received this gift, until she opened it. it was unlike all the other viktor and rolf flowerbomb parfum she uses. the color was off. there was a strong smell of alcohol. when I smelled it, I agreed. This smelled like rubbing alcohol.</li>
    <li> This perfume is great, and the price was less than anywhere else too! If you haven&#x27;t purchased some for your wife, give it a try.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my daughter and I got the best deal and it was packaged beautifully.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> This is my new all-time favorite!  Easy transaction with seller too.  Highly recommend this product :)  This is a larger size than I realized too.  Pleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> I trust Amazon. Have never had a problem with any orders ever. With that being said, I was thrilled to see my fave perfume selling for $115 as opposed to $165 at Macys. I had recently purchased one from Ebay and was ripped off so decided to go with Amazon.  Well was I robbed once again. Smells like alcohol when sprayed and has absolutely no scent! They are, however, sending a replacement. My question to them was if the replacement has no scent, what will Amazon do??? They claim they then will refund my money. Hoping the next bottle is legit.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She gets many compliments on it. It&#x27;s a nice, sexy, flower scent but not over powering.</li>
    <li> Best parfume EVER!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE Flower Bomb, this has been my favorite fragrance for about 3 years now. The product was in fabulous condition in the box. The shipping was fairly slow but I  wait for such a fabulous fragrance. I was VERY VERY UPSET that the seller had flat STOLE the sercret code off the box! The secret code gets you free samples and goodies from the Victor &amp; Rolf website and the seller helped themselves to my box and cut the code off the box. So I would not recommened this seller. I would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> This was a great price vs retail and it&#x27;s my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> I have A LOT of perfumes and this is my newest and now most favorite. A light touch is enough to get you compliments all day long. Really lovely. I started out with the smallest size (which lasted for months) and have actually bought a second bottle, the biggest one they make. It should last a good long while. Wearing it makes me feel pretty and happy. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> so fake...money returned</li>
    <li> Great buy, good price!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume, and frankly, so do I. The smell is very sweet and flowery. Prices for this size bottle anywhere else are easily over $100. The only downside to this perfume is that it is a little weak, so it takes a few sprays to get a full day of smell, so it can go quick if not used sparingly.</li>
    <li> My wife found Flowerbomb on a trip to NYC several years ago.  She loves this fragrance and I love it when she wears it. I wanted to get her some for Valentines.  This size would cost over $150 at Saks. I received the shipment in 3 or 4 days. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this Valentine&#x27;s gift. Good price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Great... My wife loved it</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for years... Usually buy it at over-priced up scaled stores, this is the cheapest price I have ever purchased for.  Received brand new in the same packaging - never again will I over-pay.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in original box. However special promo offer codes were removed from box with an exacto knife and the product was resealed. I guess I got what I paid for but I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the product being opened and having some of the contents removed. And then having the item resealed to appear as if it had never been opened.</li>
    <li> I HAD TO SENT IT BACK IT WAS FAKE AND IT SMELLED AWFUL ... IT WAS FAKE AND EXPENSIVE... NEVER AGAIN!!! WHATEVER YOU DO GUYS DONTTTT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE... IVE BEEN CHASING FOR MY MONEY FOR TWO MONTHS .........</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s my error for ordering \\&quot;scent un-smelled,\\&quot; but I am not a fan of Flowerbomb. It reminds me of grandma and smells like floral baby powder. After reading raving reviews of it, I expected it to be more of a sweet, Pink Sugar scent. Waaay off. I&#x27;m glad I only purchased the mini bottle.</li>
    <li> Never thought I would buy a fake from Amazon.  Flowerbomb fragrance lasts 10 minutes. Went to local store, used their Flowerbomb spray and it lasted all day! Won&#x27;t take it back. Had to work an extra shift at work just to pamper myself with fake Flowerbomb........ No more Amazon orders!</li>
    <li> I really do love this perfume.  It just smells great and the scent last.  Not cheap, but worth it.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good perfume. I like it.</li>
    <li> I typically will wear a lotion like Japnese Blossom from Bath and Body, but on my date nights I always without exception spray on some of the Flower Bomb on my hair and clothes.  I have had so many compliments on how good I smell which I see readers like myself say the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like anything strong so this works for me:)  Love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery....thank you!  5-Stars</li>
    <li> This is amazing perfume.  A gift from amazing daughters.  One issue.  When I opened the box, there was a booklet that indicated on the inside of the box was a code number to register online, with Viktor Rolf.  The code number was removed.  ????? Everything else was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Audrey Pruitt</li>
    <li> Pretty amazing purchase. price initially blew me away could believe it was this much cheaper and still the real deal. But I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and purchased because it is in fact the authentic fragrance and shipping was pretty fast too.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle (the first I bought from Macy&#x27;s) and I can definitely tell a difference.  I do not think that this is the real Flowerbomb.  If it is the real Flowerbomb, then it has been badly damaged by improper storage.  Extended storage in high heats can alter the scent and even darken the color of the perfume.  The perfume smells like an old bottle of Chanel Chance, not Flowerbomb.  I would hate to say that the bottle sent to me was a knock-off, because I have purchased so many quality products from Amazon in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would like to note that I was suspicious when I noticed that the secret authentication code was missing (or cut out)  from the box, and it appeared that the box had been opened several times before it reached my doorstep.  With that being said, I cannot say for sure that this item is not a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that there are no returns allowed on this product, so proceed with extreme caution when considering this item. If all of Amazon&#x27;s stock resembles anything remotely close to the poor fragrance that I received, I do not recommend purchasing this item.  Sometimes the amazingly low price is too good to be true.</li>
    <li> Perfect for me. You should try it</li>
    <li> I smelled this on my cousin and fell in loved. So I had to order. It was very comparable to Macys price. $2 difference.  Love the smell</li>
    <li> Gift for my daughter. But I know this is a scent she loves. The price was much better than elsewhere. JO</li>
    <li> Very nice,  thank you.</li>
    <li> smells great she realy loves it thank you</li>
    <li> No code on the box not real flower bomb smell, smells weak. really disappointed in this purchase. The price was not worth the buy.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy! It smells incredible and it last a very long time! Any girl would love to have this item.</li>
    <li> This scent is amazing both straight from the bottle and on me. Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, of course, but on me this is the best-smelling thing EVER.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle I had to purchase the biggest size they offered. I receive so many compliments on this fragrance. I absolutely love this fragrance</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> This our Mother&#x27;s Day present for our Mom because she wants this more than anything else. The scent is great and I love it when she has it on.</li>
