      <li>Completely over hyped, you are better off using Biolage Conditioning Balm, cheaper and works better.</li>
      <li>They were all right!</li>
      <li>Of course if you decide to give it a try, the fact that it comes in a little 3.3oz squeeze tube is ideal - that way</li>
      <li>It provides great slip so that you can carefully comb through your curls with ease.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Started using this 2 weeks ago. I use it twice a week and let it sit on my wet hair for about five minutes.  Definitely noticed my hair getting softer.</li>
    <li> I use many of the macadamia oil products in addition to Terax shampoo and conditioner. I had high hopes for this product since all the other macadamia oil stuff I use is so awesome. Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t do much, if anything to my hair. However I&#x27;ll be the first to admit my hair isn&#x27;t damaged and that I use repairing products as maintenance, so perhaps if my hair needed work this might have been the product that helped. It is super thick and creamy, and has a light clean scent.</li>
    <li> This is a great deep conditioner.  Leaves hair soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I saw so many reviews online about how soft and strong it made everyones&#x27; hair; as well as how good it smellsâ€¦and you know what? They were all right! Its a little bit on the pricey side, but def worth it over any salon brand I have ever tried. This stuff made me leave my addiction for Aveda behind, and I am not going back! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner 2 times a week.  It helps moisturize my color treated hair.  I really like it and it helps with my &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; ends by smoothing them.</li>
    <li> Great product my hair felt so good. If your looking for a great hair mask, then buy this product!! Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic - it&#x27;s so nourishing, smells great and leave hair silky smooth and fully conditioned. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Fake product. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first but I just bought a new bottle from Ulta and verified the difference. The product in the Amazon bottle I got was pure white and had a strong fragrance. The actual Macadamia Conditioner is off-white, sorta beige and shimmery with a more pleasant smell. Also, I paid double on Amazon for this fake product. Never again.</li>
    <li> My hair is so in love with his leave in the shine I get from this product I never had before</li>
    <li> 3 days later and my hair is still soft and silky, definitly a great deep conditioner, and I love the smell!</li>
    <li> I am a 4a natural hair type who flat irons her hair straight 50 % of the year and this conditioner gives me LIFE! You must apply a small amounts on wet hair and comb thru. That is the trick. Use too much and your hair will be heavy and the smell will be too intense. My hair is smoother, retains length , and ends aren&#x27;t as split</li>
    <li> Delivery is really fast , I like it , it is good for frizzy hair</li>
    <li> This product smells really good and it makes your hair feel very soft and managable.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product saved my hair!  I had some areas of my hair very damaged for high lighting and since the first time that I applied this macadamia oil my hair was much better.  The second time that I used the hair was completely recovered.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After hearing rave reviews, I decided to give this a try since I am a HUGE conditioner fan. I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;m dissapointed but I just don&#x27;t see the hype over this. Its very thick, smells great and goes on smooth. I just didn&#x27;t see more than stellar results.  Of course if you decide to give it a try, the fact that it comes in a little 3.3oz squeeze tube is ideal - that way you&#x27;re not breaking the bank purchasing the full size tub and have a decent amount of uses without wasting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyonre looking to try something new.</li>
    <li> This is seriously a miracle in a bottle I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last four years and I highly recommended it to anyone your hair feels so amazing after very high quality product my mother inlaw is a hairdresser that&#x27;s how I discovered it. This hair mask is worth every penny! :)</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week after shampoo in the shower.  Leave it in around 7 minutes and rinse.  Has made a big differnece in the softness and shine of my hair without weighing it down.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair that tends to frizz.  This product works well for me as a deep conditioner, and I also use a pea-sized amount as a leave-in conditioner.  It cuts down on the frizz and makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great! used it for the first time today, and it left my hair so soft and silky. I mixed it with the healing oil treatment and I&#x27;m glad i did. I was going to use it by itself, but I wanted to use the healing oil treatment as well, but not by itself so I mixed It and left it in for about 7 or 8 minutes, and my hair was sooo soft and moisturized after I washed it out!!! get this stuff ASAP. you&#x27;ll be glad you did, although different stuff works for different people, it&#x27;ll probably end up working for you! give it a try :)</li>
    <li> I was surprised how much I liked this!  Conditions well, smells good...really great product!  I would buy again for sure!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always weird about trying new products, and after reading some reviews online worried about the quality and integrity of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item works well when used about 1-2 a week, and I strongly recommend leaving it in for at least 7-10 minutes. Any less and you don&#x27;t get the full benefits of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works well as a leave in conditioner, just about a pea size does the trick for my short hair, maybe a bit more for moderate or thicker hair. Not to mention it smells GREAT!</li>
    <li> When I had got it I had washed my hair the product left my hair with a nice scent &amp; leaves my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> i bought this because i heard a lot of rave about it, i have used it as a masque and to condition the ends of my ends, but i find it to heavy on my hair, i have oily thin hair so its always an issue with this kind of products, i try to use it 1 a week and just on the ends of my hair, leave it for 5 minutes and wash it off, i find that works better this way.</li>
    <li> Product has expired. The expiration date on the product has passed.</li>
    <li> Ppl said it smelled bad &amp; didn&#x27;t help their hair.... Please this stuff is for real! Luv it! I recommend!</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling sooo soft and not greasy, like lots of other products. It did me wonders, I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it so much , macadamia natural oil change my damaged hair to silky ,shiny and healthy hair again . I will purchase this item again and again .</li>
    <li> Works Wonders On My Hair I Love This Stuff, I&#x27;ll be using this instead of my previous product Nexxus Deep Conditioner and Replacing it with the Macadamia Oil Deep Conditioner ....</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home to mom about its just OK. It didn&#x27;t damage my hair or make it gross but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair either.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! First time I used it I left it in for a few hrs.. My hair felt great! The next time I used this product I left it in overnight.. My hair felt and looked great and the smell of clean hair lasted. Works Amazing! For the price.. you must try this.  I&#x27;m happy that I did. My hair felt as great as when I had my deep conditioning done at the salon. Will be buying more! ðŸ˜‰</li>
    <li> I picked up this hair treatment after a few days of careful reviewing. My hair has always been dry and with a few bleachings under my belt, it&#x27;s been a little worse lately. I&#x27;ve had this for about a month now and have used it about 4 times (the instructions recommend not using it more than twice a week) and each time my hair has felt softer, less frizzy and easier to manage. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but considering I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times in a month and I still have a lot of it left over, I think it&#x27;s worth it. I also have long (to the middle of my back) hair and don&#x27;t have to use much on it. The product arrived quickly, sealed, and in good condition! Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I just love using this product. The more time you leave it in the softer your hair is. I try to leave this on my damp hair for 5-15 mins.then rinse it out with damp water.</li>
    <li> I definitely expected this to be more like a hair treatment and less like a conditioner. But even as a conditioner I felt it was hard to wash out and it made my hair feel a little goopey.</li>
    <li> This Product works really well.  After trying it for the first time I am convinced this is the one for me.  My hair has grown and not much shedding in my comb at all in just one month.</li>
    <li> Love it! made my hair super soft and smells sooo good! I will be repurchasing soon when mine runs out</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Its is made up of magical unicorn tears that rain down to make your hair like a mermaid. Dont delay. You need this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I have processed curly/wavy long hair. I highlight my hair and it&#x27;s frizzy. This product didn&#x27;t work any miracle. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Such an intense conditioner that you don&#x27;t even need to leave it in for the 3-5 minutes it instructs. Helped keep my twice-bleached hair from getting any more split ends and it always feels so soft after I use it (I use once/week).</li>
    <li> I saw increased shine to my hair after just one use. It is a very thick rich cream that seems to really stick to the hair and not run off and drip all over</li>
    <li> I have used this as my daily conditioner for four years, and I absolutely love it. To make it last longer I will sometimes mix it with another conditioner (usually Dove) before applying it to my hair. My curly hair comes out soft and completely tangle free. I refuse to travel without it, so this size is perfect for my travel bag. It&#x27;s also a great size if you want to try the product but don&#x27;t want to pay for the larger size. I have introduced several people to this product, and they all use it now. There are times that hair and beauty products on Amazon are not authentic. The item I received 11/2014 is authentic.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this conditions my hair very well..,</li>
    <li> i recently over dyed my hair and was looking for an intense repair hair mask and this was it. it smells amazing and leaves your hair feeling so soft. i ended up buying it twice. high reccomend it</li>
    <li> This stuff is fake.  We bought 3 for gifts &amp; personal use.  I used a squirt of the bottle I bought at ulta and a squirt of this.  The color, texture, smell &amp; everything was wrong and different! Save the trouble and just buy in store.  The REAL product is awesome!</li>
    <li> Best product ever to untangle crazy hair like mine. Excellent.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use it once a week and it leaves my hair looking very healthy and vey shinny.</li>
    <li> Nice worked as I expected.</li>
    <li> love this product.  it deeply conditions without leaving hair limp.  i really like having it in a tube form.  the jar is too cumbersome for my needs.</li>
    <li> I love this masque! If you think it doesn&#x27;t work, try washing your hair with a regular old shampoo and conditioner one day, and then the next use this masque! I have thick hair so I use it every other day with a shampoo &amp; conditioner and the results are to die for.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it feels it makes my hair a little too oily for my liking (but it may be my fault in case I&#x27;m using a little too much) but overall this is a great product and works well! I get lots of compliments on how good my hair smells also :) As long as it&#x27;s not over-used, this product will do wonders for your hair! Give it a try.</li>
    <li> After reading and watching youtube gurus rave about this product, I decided to try it. I ordered and I think that other than it&#x27;s expensive, I did not have any different result as if you used only conditioner. my hair felt soft for 5 minutes, then return to normal. little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it smells great, and leaves my hair soft and detangled. I&#x27;ve noticed less split ends immediately after my hair dries. I followed the advice of another reviewer and have been using a small amount as a leave-in conditioner. It works wonderfully as intended too, but it&#x27;s also a great quick fix.</li>
    <li> My hair loves loves loves this</li>
    <li> I love this product! It provides great slip so that you can carefully comb through your curls with ease. Smells nice, and leaves hair so soft with no residue.</li>
    <li> leaves my hair nice and silky after i rinse it out. definitely feels moisturized but it doesnt wear my hair down. is it a miracle no but i will add to regime.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected, no complaints. Nice item for the price and just like it looks in the photo !</li>
    <li> I bought this at the recommendation of the sales girl at Ulta, but it&#x27;s so much cheaper on amazon! I use after the pureology clarifying shampoo and my hair has never felt so soft and clean. Amazing stuff and I will purchase again and again as my hair always feels dry and dull. I don&#x27;t typically review products, but between this and the pureology clarifying shampoo , I was super impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Updated 8/25/15: This is one of the first hair products I have continued to repurchase. I use this about once a week and still love it. It smells amazing and always make my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I just brought this but kind of confuse about how i should  use this. do i apply it after shampooing my hair? do i rinse it off after applying it? HELP!!</li>
    <li> I have lots of thick, somewhat coarse, naturally blond hair.  I wanted something to make my hair soft, smooth and a little shiny.  This did an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Great product, didn&#x27;t come exploded in its package like another product I ordered. I am pleased with this one this time.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous products for a small section of hair that gets a rough texture and frizzy now and then. Deep conditioners, hair masks, leave in treatments - nothing worked until this product. It smells amazing too. I will absolutely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I heard so many great reviews on it so I decided to give it a try and I have to say im glad i did! made my hair feel sooooooooooooooooo much healthier after just one use. i know i used a lot of O&#x27;s but i needed too lol. This came a lot sooner than I thought it would and im thankfull for that because I dont know what I was doing before I had this product.</li>
    <li> its awesome! its basically a deep conditioner, but if you have really thick hair you can use it as an everyday conditioner. You just put it in, leave it there for a few minutes (i suggest combing threw ur hair with a widetooth comb to detangle and distribute it evenly) and then you just wash it out. it smells great to me and it makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> My daughter has gorgeous mixed hair, which needs moisture like crazy! I was using Olive Oil deep conditioner but I had to leave it on for 15-60 minutes which is hard to do on a three year old. This works so much better even though it&#x27;s more expensive. I bought it for me (and love it because it makes my hair so soft) but now I will continue to use it on her.</li>
    <li> The mask is very moisturizing it smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling great! I recommend this mask to anyone with damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing I really use it on days my hair is tangled (I have long hair) by the time I brush it feels like butter.</li>
    <li> Love this deep conditioner. It makes my hair so soft and it smells amazing</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a whole now and I love it !! It&#x27;s great for curly or straight hair the seller was great got everything on time : )  will use again !!</li>
    <li> I was nervous from some of the other product reviews from this brand, but this product works great. I use it about 2-3 times per week and it makes my hair so shiny and smells great.</li>
    <li> This product really makes a difference. I decided to buy this after not getting my hair trimmed for a good while in which my hair had become rather dry and developed some split ends. But after using this product for over a month, I noticed that my hair was actually getting softer. I kept pushing the day to get my hair trimmed because this product was making my hair better haha! I keep buying this product because it works for me.</li>
    <li> It smells incredible the smell is  similar to the loreal feria conditioner in their hair dye box, but it left my hair feeling very coarse my natural curls did not appreciate it. I will not purchase this product again! This is an absolute NO for naturals. The Dimethicone Silicone my hair was just not loving, i would recommend it for those with straight hair who do not mind silicones as for my experience it left a very dry cast almost a barrier against moisture for my hair and i evenly coated my hair with coconut oil prior to application just in case as well as set the timer for 7 minutes exactly. so I can only imagine the results for one who does not use an oil beforehand.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Made my kinky curly hair so soft and easy to detangle. I left it on for an hour. It smells great. The only thing I would change is the price, even though its worth every penny. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have curly thick hair.  All I have to say this product is great!!! I only used it once and my hair is sooooo soft. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Always seems to leave my hair super soft!&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Very moisturizing. Highly recommended :)&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention it smells really good too?</li>
    <li> Completely over hyped, you are better off using Biolage Conditioning Balm, cheaper and works better. Smells good and could be used as an everyday conditioner, that&#x27;s how light it is.</li>
    <li> its good but its a lot of work to put it in and then wash it out</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after Day 1 of using this product. I highly recommend it for people with thick hair!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! Nothing makes my thick hair as soft as this stuff does!</li>
    <li> I love the Macadamia shampoo. This product however was disappointing. It left a weird build up and smelled awful. If you have thin hair I would stay far away. I have thick hair and it left mine feeling weighed down and greasy. Not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My hair feels so much healthier now then it ever has before. i love it. And it arrived quickly too :)</li>
