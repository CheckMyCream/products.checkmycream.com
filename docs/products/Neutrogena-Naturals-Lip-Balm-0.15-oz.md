      <li>Goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>I needed around $5 to get the free shipping</li>
      <li>so if you really need this sort of thing then this is certainly better than most lip balms out there.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only kind that keep my lips from chapping!</li>

      <li>I bought more as stocking stuffers for the whole family.</li>
      <li>Personally my favorite lip balms are aveeno because they seem to apply much smoother.</li>
      <li>nice, it makes the lips soft and doesn&#x27;t taste like anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He has super sensitive lips that irritate very easily.</li>

      <li>It also stays on for a good long time.</li>
      <li>My new favorite</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> At last I found a lip balm that does not chap my lips. Also, this is non-greasy and does not leave smudges on my water glass. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> All natural, doesn&#x27;t leave a weird film, doesn&#x27;t taste gross, makes your lips silky. It&#x27;s perfect, and I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
    <li> Nice, smooth, pleasant</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  I don&#x27;t use it cause I don&#x27;t lap my lips all the time.</li>
    <li> Living in the desert, it&#x27;s almost mandatory to carry a good quality lip balm. This coats well, not too thin/thick, and helps calm cracks. If you apply to heavily, it can show. Seems to last for about 5 hours, and no funky taste.</li>
    <li> This feels every bit as good on your lips as the regular Neutrogena Lip Moisturizer,  and with more natural ingredients! I discovered it on Amazon---have never seen it in a retail store. It has no flavors or smells to contend with--very pleasant. I have been a longtime user of the original product, but will be buying this one from now on!</li>
    <li> feels oily. use this and after 30 mins, my lips are dry again.</li>
    <li> My lips get chapped quite frequently and this is the only product that has helped. I tried other lip balms (including multiple natural varieties), but they all either irritate my lips further or just simply don&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Even if I have severely chapped lips, I can put this on overnight and my lips will be a lot softer and barely even chapped by the time I wake up. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have a flavor and only has a light smell. It also doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like lots of other types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The only negative thing I can think of is that it does cost more than a lot of other lip balms and I can never seem to find it in any stores. But the fact that it works wonderfully is enough for me to look past that.</li>
    <li> I am certified lip balm ADDICT! Sometimes I would wake up at night because my lips were so dry.... Until I tried the Neutrogena Naturals. Seriously, I can use this once or twice a day and I&#x27;m good! I was having a hard time finding it in stores so I was delighted to find it on Amazon! It&#x27;s probably made me much more professional since I&#x27;m no longer stopping my corporate training class to frantically dig through my bags and find lip balm. This lip balm took me to rehab! Please don&#x27;t stop making it before I die!</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly, has a nice silky, non-sticky feel, and isn&#x27;t full of nasty chemicals. It also stays on for a good long time. Ordering from Amazon is much less expensive than buying at the drugstore, about 40% cheaper.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this lip balm when it first came out and loved it.  It&#x27;s much smoother, less sticky than the old Chapstick brand and seems to last longer.  My lips are noticeably softer and less chaped with Neutrogena than other brands.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product as a single (from a physical store) for a gift bag of skin products for my girlfriend on her birthday. She was also leaving for home for the holidays so (as we live in Miami Beach) she would be going to the Midwest and cold weather. I&#x27;m a lip balm addict so when I saw this on Amazon I had to get it. Gone are the days of $.99 ChapStick so if you really need this sort of thing then this is certainly better than most lip balms out there.</li>
    <li> I got a tube of this in a sample beauty bag a couple of years ago. It has a slightly more oily feel than other lip balm. I was never a big lip balm wearer, so I had the tube for a while, but I did think it worked well. My boyfriend, however, uses chapstick all the time. He has super sensitive lips that irritate very easily. He forgot his chapstick one time and borrowed this. From there, he was hooked. He says nothing else he has used has helped his lips as much and he goes through about a tube or so a month, so I order pretty frequently.</li>
    <li> we do need these lip balm all winter long!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Cannot find locally...</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! Feels exactly like chap stick without all the chemicals and bad stuff. I wish it came in slightly tinted but if it means changing the feel of it I&#x27;d prefer it stay exactly like it is.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm!</li>
    <li> I suffer with terribly chapped lips in the winter. I have experimented with everything out there. I find alot of lip balms either too waxy or too light and ineffectual. This year I had a terrible episode of painful, chapped, flakey lips. I threw everything away and only used Blistex Medicated Ointment, which cleared me up and have been using Neutrogena Naturals lip balm to maintain moisture and health. I really think the vitamin E and lack of chemicals, parabens, etc. makes the difference. Its light and very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a lip balm that doesn&#x27;t contain menthol or other irritants, like Burt&#x27;s Bees.  These turned out great.  Find myself having to apply these to my lips much less frequently than the others, which helps wean me off of my lip balm addiction.</li>
    <li> works great!! haven&#x27;t had dry chapped lips since I been using this! won&#x27;t use anything else. I love this stuff. it doesn&#x27;t have that waxy feel like chapstick does. This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> Gf loves this stuff, she goes through 1 a month. I actually use it from time to time. Not too much fragrance and keeps your lips moist for a few hours at a time.</li>
    <li> Works great but does not leave a after taste. It does not churn my stomach either like some other products that makes me nauseous after applying it.</li>
    <li> I did not like the way it feels on my lips.  Very waxy.  I will be sticking to my burts bees</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore, but I love this lip balm!</li>
    <li> I have tried many ,many lip balms this one is by far the best. Keeps my lips moist and doesn&#x27;t taste awful!</li>
    <li> I would buy this product again, and again.</li>
    <li> It works great and I love that there is no petroleum like Chapstick.  Wonder that that last ingredient is tho :-/</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever! No weird taste. Leaves lips soft. I absolutely love this product! This is the best ever!</li>
    <li> As a lip balm addict, this is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with licking my lips and drying them out. I was buying the cheap lip balms that didn&#x27;t work as well. I started becoming obsessed with lip balms after my sister let me try some of her &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; lip balm. From there I started experimenting with lip balms trying a new one after my previous ones were used up. I mentally took note of how long the lip balm kept my lips moisturized and how shiny it made my lips on application (for me less was better). I ended up liking the Neutrogena Norwegian Lip Moisturizer and this product. However, this one seemed to have less shine upon application while still keeping my lips moisturized. So far I am satisfied and am sticking to this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lip balm.  I have been using it for several years.  It&#x27;s the only kind that keep my lips from chapping!</li>
    <li> nothing special here. i use it up quickly, which means it&#x27;s a little too expensive for my budget. i was hoping the product would be longer lasting.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about lip balm. I have tried so many kinds, and many just dry out my lips and make me feel like I constantly need to reapply. Others are so sticky my hair gets stuck to my lips when it is windy outside. This product is just right. It is moisturizing without being sticky. It has a nice, clean scent.  It does not dry out your lips. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Just perfect!</li>
    <li> I hate most lip balms, for example NIVEA&#x27;s. They are oily, way too much. However, as all Neutrogena products, this solution is very subtle but does the job very well and for long. Scent is interesting, it reminds me something but I cannot recall what exactly.</li>
    <li> Nice little balm. Lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> Natural ingredients that don&#x27;t cause your lips to dry (which is what chap stick and other lip balms actually do so you can keep buying them).  Also, it conveniently comes in a pack of two because you know you&#x27;re gonna lose one.</li>
    <li> I wrote to J&amp;J to inquire about the lack of availability of their &amp;#34;Daily Hydration Therapy&amp;#34; which they said was &amp;#34;discontinued&amp;#34;. J&amp;J recommended trying Neutrogena Naturals. Excellent moisturizer with staying power. Only thing missing is Sunscreen SPF 10 or 20.</li>
    <li> Incredibly good lip balm. Best I&#x27;ve used so far for a while now.  Really keeps my lips moist and protected, especially during the winter. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used approximately 2,487 lip balms and this is my favorite. Love the lack of flavor and gross ingredients. Unless you&#x27;re going sun tanning, it&#x27;s the only lip balm you&#x27;ll need!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip balm. I find it to be less &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; than Chapstick, yet just as effective. I&#x27;ve also tried Caramex and Blistex (stick and lotion), but prefer Neutrogena Naturals..</li>
    <li> this is a great product for winter dry months on the east coast. i use it daily and has kept my lips from winter cracking and hurting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lip balm for about 3 months now and I love it. I&#x27;ve been through one and am on my second. I&#x27;ve been a Carmex user for years and use it occasionally but given the choice, I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how easily it goes on -even when it has been sitting in my freezing backpack, it still glides on easily. It moisturizes just as long as my other lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm with the product is that it disappears fast and I wish I got more for my money. I never buy this full price and the only thing keeping me from buying more/giving it 5 stars is the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated on 12/02/2012:&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to other lip balms I&#x27;ve tried recently, I&#x27;ve decided I won&#x27;t buy this lip balm anymore. In comparison to Nivea lipbalms (A Kiss of Smoothness and A Kiss of Mint to be more specific) and EOS lipbalms, I feel like there aren&#x27;t enough benefits to this quickly-disappearing lip balm for the price paid.</li>
    <li> Just be warned, this was mintier than I thought it would be. But it&#x27;s affordable and has a great texture. I have sensitive skin and lips, so it&#x27;s really gentle. It has a soothing scent.</li>
    <li> I used so many lip balms including the costly organic varieties and finally zeroed this one. This is a non greasy and quickly absorbing lip balm. This works great during summer and in winter I apply this during day time. I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly 3 years and I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing. It was not moisturizing a bit. Ended up with even more chapped lips.</li>
    <li> Love it, just as described</li>
    <li> I love these! They don&#x27;t change the color of your lips or have an overpowering scent. They do the job they&#x27;re supposed to do! I wish they were a little bigger, just for the fact that I have rather large lips and they get chapped quite often so I go through these guys a lot.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm, especially in winter.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I can&#x27;t stand strong-smelling lip balm. All natural Chapstick is no longer made, so I tried this as a replacement and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> The thing I like most about this lip balm is that it doesn&#x27;t feel like a film or &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; on my lips. It does have a slight &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;, which is surprisingly pleasant.</li>
    <li> The only Lip alm that actually works!&lt;br /&gt;No stinging or burning. No harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it.</li>
    <li> this product goes on nice and smoothly yet is not too greasy.  the price was excellent. i would have no problem reccomending this to an avid lip balm user!</li>
    <li> I needed around $5 to get the free shipping so I stumbled onto this.  I like the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients in it and it has a cool, refreshing taste.  I didn&#x27;t think the price was too bad either. It&#x27;s worth a try. :0)</li>
    <li> I love love love this lip balm! It is soo moisturizing and makes my lips feel soo soft and smooth. It has a slight mint smell to it, but that does not bother me at all.</li>
    <li> since i really love cherry flavored chapstick i had a hard time enjoying this. i enjoy trying new things, but i wont purchase again</li>
    <li> Works great and does not melt in my pocket even on hot days.</li>
    <li> this is not moist enough and is not working for more than one person at our home.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a stocking gift. I expect it to be good.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. My son likes to use it in the winter. I like the 2 pack. The end.</li>
    <li> This is a no frills, scent free chapstick, which I love.  I don&#x27;t like the ones that have lots of smells or feel thick from application.  This goes on smooth and helps keep super chapped lips in better shape for the winter.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really it actually helped chapped lips. It feels and smells nice but Lush&#x27;s Lip Service is a better natural alternative to quickly healing.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm!!  We can&#x27;t find it in any store around here.</li>
    <li> (wife here) I got this a couple years ago in a Target makeup bag giveaway and fell in love. It is natural ingredients, goes on smooth and not overly thick and greasy like petroleum based lip balms, has a nice, hint of not quite minty but similar smell to it, a crisp clean smell and does not taste bad at all. Would recommend if you need a lip balm but dont want to look like you sucked on a jar of vaseline.</li>
    <li> I can give this lip balm all the stars that it needs for Neutrogena to continue producing the same formula!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a must for me to moisturize my lips, especially during winter since I live in LA. I&#x27;ve tried so many lip balms in the past and they either don&#x27;t work well enough or they start to get grossly sticky after constant use. I&#x27;ve finally met a match for my lips after taking a chance with Neutrogena Naturals Lip Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent and taste are so subtle that I barely know what they are exactly or if the stick is actually unscented and tasteless. What matters to me is that I no longer have chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips have never felt this great and healthy before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like this better than Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Lip Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have dry lips year round especially in the winter when they want to burn, crack &amp; peal.  I needed a natural lip balm without a smell as a strong odor such as pepperment would burn my eyes.  This does not taste or smell.  It is not waxy or greasy.  I apply it to my lips &amp; then apply Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick Softsilver Rose &amp; I am good to go.  This lipstick holds its color as I prefer light pinks or natural lipsticks &amp; it keeps the chapstick from wearing off.  I also wear this lip balm to bed.  This lip balm soothes my burning lips as long as it is on.  I must continuously wear lip balm as this only treats symptoms, but does not cure.  I will probably order super savor plan when I see how long these 2 tubes last. My family generally enjoy Neutrogena products such as Deep Facial Cleanser &amp; the body wash.</li>
    <li> We only use Neutrogena lip balm and love the new Naturals line.  The clear tube allows you to see when you are running out, and it smells like peppermint.</li>
    <li> I have tried more lip balms then I can think of!  I have always liked Burt&#x27;s bees, but this has become my fave!  I love it because its perfect for my kids.  They hated the Burt&#x27;s bees because  the peppermint \\&quot;burned\\&quot; their lips.  And everything else has too much flavor, so they end up licking their lips and making them worse!  This is virtually tasteless, and completely natural. Its perfect!  Goes on smooth, conditions lips very well.</li>
    <li> I really like this lip balm. I used to use the blue chap-stick tube which is the moisturizing kind but started to find it a bit too waxy. I picked this up on a whim in a local store and really liked it but couldn&#x27;t find it once i ran out of my first tube. I went back to the old chapstick but could literally feel the difference so ordered this on amazon. It&#x27;s held up pretty well during this winter (i&#x27;m in the northeast) so this is a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> The packaging is not pretty, but the product works extremely well for me. I had tried many different items, but either they didn&#x27;t work, or they felt greasy. I bought more as stocking stuffers for the whole family. We need something in the Winter in the N.E., both to protect and to remedy dry lips.</li>
    <li> Really helped my lips feel better and it stays on good too.</li>
    <li> So my previous chap stick was burts bee which i liked alot because it healed my lips but this one works better than burts bees and i like it alot. so diffidently going to order more</li>
    <li> Really!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its nice, it makes the lips soft and doesn&#x27;t taste like anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time too, I bought it back in 2011 and I still haven&#x27;t finished the first pack. (I don&#x27;t use it everyday).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for men</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lip balm.  It&#x27;s not a cure for Cancer.  It&#x27;s OK</li>
    <li> Worked ok - better options out there</li>
    <li> This is the BEST lip balm ever and the only one that I can use in my dry climate.</li>
    <li> Wife said it is the Best lip balm she&#x27;s tried.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because it is from Neutrogena, and I use a lot of their products. As a protection for the lips and help in avoiding having them cracked by the bitter cold, this is an awesome product! Just like the rest of Neutrogena&#x27;s products. The only drawback I found with it is that it is too hard, not fluid enough. It needs to be pressed too hard on the lips to apply, and it needs to be reapplied often enough, though this must also be because it really gets absorbed by the lips, protecting them at the same time. All in all, my lips are very hydrated and feeling wonderful since I started using this product. I only wish it was more fluid than it actually is.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered...thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;All natural.&lt;br /&gt;Clear color tube, which allows you to see how much product is left.&lt;br /&gt;Light mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well without making me breakout.</li>
    <li> not too tacky. I use it every night!</li>
    <li> I love this .... using it since more than 5 years now.... it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t keep your lips dry</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. Been using this exclusively for our whole family for a couple years now.</li>
    <li> This is a solid lip balm. I&#x27;m not always looking for glossy lips, sometimes I just want healthy, moisturized, natural lips. This will do the trick...even my boyfriend can use it. It does seem to make lips softer after regular use and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I was really suprised how much I actually liked this lip balm! I find it hard to attain one I actually like completely. It is perfect if you&#x27;re looking for something to moisturize your lips just enough. It is worth the price!</li>
    <li> seems to be like a lot of other lip balm i guess. Its doing what is supposed to do. Personally my favorite lip balms are aveeno because they seem to apply much smoother.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip balm.  I go through about a tube a month and I cannot find it in any stores in my area.  Super smooth and lasts a long time.  I love that is it all natural.  No petroleum products! I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
    <li> These are very hydrating and and do not have an obnoxious smell/flavor.  They are not overly waxy and do not get too hard in the cold car.  I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> This goes on nicely and moisturizes well, and the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the mint.  It&#x27;s way better than the Lizard Lips brand I also tried.</li>
    <li> I have fried all kinds of lip balm available from the expensive ones to the cheapest ones but found that Neutrogena Naturals Lip Balm does the trick for me.  It doesn&#x27;t have a powerful scent to it and it moisturizes my lips for a long period of time.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> natural enough to give to any kid!</li>
    <li> For me, perfect medium between waxy and greasy lip balms. No weird scent/flavor.</li>
    <li> My family loves this lip balm.</li>
    <li> If you like Chapstick naturals (now they don&#x27;t exist) you&#x27;ll love this! My new favorite</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to using EOS lip balms so I thought that I&#x27;d give this a shot. It was advertised in Allure magazine. It fell short for me. There&#x27;s nothing speacial about this product. It&#x27;s just like chapstick.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth.  Does not tear up my lips. It has a slight mintiness to it that I personally love!</li>
    <li> I have hatted using lip balm all my life.  I have tried many different types and was never happy with them.  That changed after getting a sample of this.  Goes on easy, not waxy, no bad taste, not glossy, and works wonderfully and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially good for overnight.  Lasts for several hours and is great for indoors.  No SPF so I use a different balm for outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People say it has mint but this is barely detectible by me.  Very mild flavor at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only down side is that it is hard to find locally and a little high on cost, but still my favorite.  Blistex Simple and Sensitive is my second choice for general indoor use.</li>
