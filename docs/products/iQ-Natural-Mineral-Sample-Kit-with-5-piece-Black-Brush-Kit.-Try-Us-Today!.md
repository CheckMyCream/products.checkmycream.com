<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Overall: So I&#x27;ve tried this a few times but without the primer, which isn&#x27;t included in this kit, it just doesn&#x27;t work right. The coverage is so so. I have to layer it on to get any type of coverage for redness, my beauty mark and the dark circles under my eyes. Sadly it ends up looking caked on and cracked and it feels awful without the primer, but this happens with most mineral make up when you don&#x27;t use a proper primer. Without the primer it settles into fine lines and makes me look older then I do without make up. If I don&#x27;t exfoliate and moisturize right before I put it on it makes my skin look dried and cracked. I actually have to take a hair remover buffer to my face and neck and put a moisturizing mask on for 30 minutes then rinse and apply lotion then put my toner on and let it dry for a couple minutes then put the make up on or it looks like I&#x27;ve spent the day in a dry dessert and I have normal skin not sensitive and not oily or dry. After I put it all on , blush, warmth, bisque, foundation, veil,  shadow, liner, it looks like my skin is peeling  after having a sunburn. My toner seems to help it spread a little easier and not feel so caked on so I got the hydration spray (plus it was cheaper than the primer) to see if that will help with the dryness issue and next I will get the primer and see if that will help it spread more evenly and help with the total coverage so I don&#x27;t need to use so much product for the same amount of coverage which will help with the dryness issue too I&#x27;m sure. I will keep you updated when I start using them to let you know what does and does not work and if it is worth it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Kit: This is not a complete kit. If you are looking for a starter kit that is complete buy a different kit then this sample kit. The instructions say to put the primer on your face first or it won&#x27;t work right yet this kit doesn&#x27;t come with the primer. I think even as a sample kit if it requires primer to be used properly it should come with a small amount of primer also so people can get a real feel for the make up, but that is just my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color : I am between a fair and medium color on most mineral make up and this one the medium works well it matches my face well. I wear ivory and ivory beige or natural in most non mineral make ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushes : The brushes work well and don&#x27;t fall apart as long as you don&#x27;t clean them. The first time you clean them they will shed and they won&#x27;t stop shedding even if you don&#x27;t clean them again. Not fun very annoying trying to take all the little hairs from the face/blush brush off after each step of applying make up. The only one that I have washed and doesn&#x27;t shed is the pointy one which I use as a liner brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Shadow/Liner : I usually use other eye shadow because these colors they send are very bland and I use more vibrant colors. The eye shadow that came with it is nice and neutral colors so it&#x27;s good for most any occasion. It came with a black that I just put some mineral in the lid then using the pointy liner brush drip some water onto and mix then draw line and let dry then go over again so it looks black and not sparkle grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warmth and Blush : Both wonderful colors that blend well with the foundation color. The warmth can be used as the blush on the medium kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT buy this product again because of the company. I should not have to pay for broken items they send me not even to cover the cost of shipping back to them, especially when the cost of shipping is more than the product its self.all amount of primer also so people can get a real feel for the make up, but that is just my thoughts.

    <li> Make up is really good but color is lighter then expected im usually medium in most shades this is much lighter .</li>
    <li> Great coverage and great deal! I have very sensitive skin, so often react to cosmetics, but have had no problems with this makeup.</li>
    <li> not crazy about the product. always been a Bareminerals girl, thought I would try something new...it was just not the same</li>
    <li> GREAT MAKEUP GOES ON SMOOTH  IT GIVES YOU FULL COVERAGE. BUT IF YOUR FACE HAS ACNE DO NOT GET IT</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this.  My new favorite eyeshadow is in this set.  Definitely will be buying the larger set when I run out.</li>
    <li> Made my face break out!! Tried several times and same thing!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to see if this compared to Bare Essentuals and I must say it was lacking. The brush it came with was a joke and it only lasted about 4 hours till it settled in creases and clumped even with the finishing mist.</li>
    <li> got for my daughters for Christmas, looks like really good makeup. Smaller than expected. :(</li>
    <li> I was shocked at how much I loved this makeup! I have told my husband several times now how much I love it! It is so natural-looking and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I have naturally oily skin and am prone to acne, so I love that this doesn&#x27;t make me extra shiny or break out. The colors for the eye shadow are awesome too! I&#x27;ve been having fun mixing and matching them. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural makeup you want to try without spending a fortune, I highly recommend you try the IQ Natural makeup.</li>
    <li> The little samples are fun to play with and even though they are small it goes a long way. This way I will know what to order, later</li>
    <li> Not a bad product, just wish it wasn&#x27;t sooooo messy! but for the price, ill take it. comes with a lot of pieces and packaged nicely. The samples are a decent size. The eye shadows are really pretty and sparkly, all together you get a natural look. The brushes shed a lot and end up all over the place (use different brushes). Next time I&#x27;ll buy the regular sized stuff only if it has the protectors so the product wont spill all over America!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. The pots are a bit smaller than I was expecting though they are as big as you would expect for sample size. I am not certain of the quality of the make-up because it didn&#x27;t come with any directions and I haven&#x27;t had time to go to the website. Also it is summer and anything I try to put on right now will just melt right off. I will update as soon as I give it a go.</li>
    <li> Products are easy to use and I like knowing that they&#x27;re natural.  Color options have a wide variety.  I&#x27;m still playing with them but I notice I&#x27;m liking the blush and &#x27;bronzer&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I used it the very next day I got it.  The foundation was very smooth and my face does not look cakey wearing it like the liquid foundation would do.  The coverage is pretty good to.</li>
    <li> This product was OK. Application is easy. It doesn&#x27;t last very long for warm days. It would look cakey on some areas.</li>
    <li> Im not one who usually writes reviews but I loved the product and i have nothing bad to say about the product!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like the eyeshadows from this. Not quite sure what to do with the mini brushes but I guess I&#x27;ll figure it out. The finishing powder and bisque don&#x27;t do anything for me but the jars are filled to the max so that&#x27;s good. Great little kit to start off with!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 3xs now and so far I&#x27;m loving it. And it was alot cheap than bare minerals.</li>
    <li> I felt wonderful wearing it while at a photo shoot and shooting a commercial for my work.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this makeup. Covers well, feels light and that is great for the summer. You&#x27;l need separate containers to really work with it.</li>
    <li> I have used several mineral makeups and this is the BEST! I will purchase more very soon! Love it alot</li>
    <li> Thought I would try this make up because of the price.  As it turns out, it is as good....if not better...than the Bare Escentuals or Sheer Cover by far!!!!  The extra bonus is you don&#x27;t have to subscribe to an Automatic Shipping gimmick that keeps you tied to the item.  I would definitely tell anyone to give this one a try.  I did and I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, have not had any skin issues (breakouts, etc) with this.  The foundation sizes were big enough to try out to determine correct shade and the eyeshadows will last a very long time. I consider myself to have medium-fair skin, but purchased the medium which works well for me (and it&#x27;s winter right now). I think I will continue buying from this brand!</li>
    <li> I love this face make up! I was surprise when I received it because a little goes a long way! I ordered this for my sisters wedding because I always could notice cheaper, non-mineral, foundation and powder on my skin. It feels very light and airy, despite giving you AWESOME coverage. My skin gets very blotchy when I&#x27;m stressed out so that made a huge difference for me! The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because the shadows they give you are very shimmery. It&#x27;s fine shimmer but still, I felt like I was 12 when I wore them. They also could have included a better eye brush l, mine seems to have 2 concealer brushes of almost the same size. All in all it was DEFINITELY worth my money even though I don&#x27;t get much use out if the shadows.</li>
    <li> A nice variety of samples.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting the eyeshadows.  Don&#x27;t think I will use it though.  Requires a lot of time and patients to get it on evenly  and the powder is messy.  When you shake excess powder off the brush it goes everywhere and when you take the lid off be very careful or you could dump it.  Too much hassle for me.</li>
    <li> Cheap make up made me break out bad and containers sucked broke easily brushes fell apart and left little brush hairs all over .. Never again will I buy this</li>
    <li> i just got my sample! it is incredible. my husband said wow ur make up looks better then ive ever seen it look. its way better then bare essentuals. ive already recommended it to a friend! ill be ordering the big set. im so pleased with it!! the coverage is out of this world!</li>
    <li> Dry, not impressed. Didn&#x27;t look or feel good as I was expecting. I love Revlon&#x27;s Aqua Colorstay loose mineral power-AMAZING</li>
    <li> Wish containers were bigger. But this stuff covered all red ! And most sun spots. And I workout hard. It does a good job. Staying on.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to use powdered makeup because it always leaves this awful finish.  With the price of this sample set it was worth it to give it a try.  I have been using these for 3 days and I could not be happier with the results.  I will be purchasing the full set very soon.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size and nothing leaks out when in a make up bag and the brushes are pefect</li>
    <li> best mineral makeup kit &amp;#60;3 I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product for the price I will be buying these again!!</li>
    <li> the brushes are just ok but its just a sample kit but it comes with lots of options and i really like it!</li>
    <li> The product is great(made my pores vanish) but no brushes. Just an apologetic note. Poo. Still good deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.  Not for dry skin.  This product produced tiny cracks from overdrying.  Now my usually flawless strawberries and cream has turned into a messed up batch of fine lines and spots.  If you have dry or mature skin I would suggest a different product.  I am throwing this stuff out and going bare until my skin is clear again.</li>
    <li> There was a back order on the brushes and to their credit they shipped the makeup and brushes a short time thereafter.  My wife was very pleased with these products.  I cannot comment on their effectiveness as I am not the one using it.</li>
    <li> Nice kit for the price containers a little small to handle but have plenty of product in them. My first time out with mineral makeup but great instruction provided and looks great</li>
    <li> I was always very intrigued about the mineral makeup, I was about to get the bare escentuals brand but I had second thoughts regarding the price and I also read on some reviews about that extra chemicals they use on it. I have a very sensitive skin, and I break out very easily, so after reading a lot! decided to try IQ, they don&#x27;t add any weird stuff to the powders, and they have this sample kit for 12 bucks. When it came on the mail (very fast shipping) I opened my package and found 11 mini containers. 5 eyeshadows, 1 blush, one bronzer, 1 corrector, 2 foundations, and 1 finish powder or setting veil, plus the tiny-wee brushes.&lt;br /&gt;After applying them on the right order, I think is an awesome makeup, had a great coverage, looks super super natural, doesn&#x27;t get cake-y and you don&#x27;t feel like you are wearing a load of stuff on your face. The brushes are ok, I highly recommend to get your own brushes, a good kabuki for the foundations, a shadow brush for your corrector, and two more: one for your bronzer and blush, I think is best to have a brush for each product. The only brushes I&#x27;m gonna use are the 2 eyeshadow ones. the rest is too bad quality. Even when this is a sampler, the containers are filled up completely...a lot of product!, you just use a tiny bit, I swirl my powders on a big lid from other product, &#x27;coz the container ones wouldn&#x27;t hold my big brushes.&lt;br /&gt;to get best results...Wash your face, tone it up, get a good moisturizer, let it dry and apply your stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review was helpful.</li>
    <li> Biggest complaint is the size of the containers. Too small to get the application brush in. Spilt half of it on counter just trying to use (foundation and veil). Foundation brush extremely cheap</li>
    <li> Broke my daughters face out.</li>
    <li> Quality product,  very nice finish and just as good as the &amp;#34;BIG&amp;#34; market names on tv and for the price you simply can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Product is great! I absolutely love the &amp;#34;Face Warmth&amp;#34;. I will more than likely buy the full size product. It gives a nice natural looking bronze. The eye shadows have a few weird colors, but they are all beautiful. I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The product came pretty fast so I was happy with that, however as far as the product itself goes I must admit I was a little disappointed with some aspects of it. The containers are so incredibly small it&#x27;s almost impossible to get the brush in it and you will always end up wasting more than you actually use. The coverage of the makeup is pretty good I must admit but you have to go easy and light handed with it or you will look like someone just blew chalk in your face. Over all not too bad and I would order it again if and only if they made the containers bigger so you can at least fit the brush in it without making a huge mess, also the brush itself is rough and sheds all over the face, so new brush as well and will order again.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this mineral makeup starter kit. I ordered the medium shade, which is the color Ive always worn. When the item arrived, both shades of the medium were both way too pale for me. Otherwise the rest of the items were amazing. The apricot eyeshadow was stunning. I contacted the seller, and she immediately sent me the right shades for me to be able to try. I must say, Im impressed. She replied to my emails quickly and Im a very satisfied customer! I will be a loyal customer for a long time. Thanks so much IQminerals for beautiful mineral makeup from a company that cares about their consumers.</li>
    <li> comes with a great deal to try out</li>
    <li> I like it! I like how it came with eyeshadows. I did not know that it comes with it.</li>
    <li> I usually use bare minerals but wanted to try a lower cost product. Saw several reviews on a few different ones but this one had the  best reviews.  I think the product is very good. Color is hard to estimate but this starter kit came with 2 so that helped a lot. Don&#x27;t  expect too much from the brushes,  they are not good quality but i had my own. Mineral veil is just a white powder, definitely a difference from bare minerals. Overall i think the products  work well and aside from the brushes and mineral veil i would buy again.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my teenage daughter. I hated the idea of her wearing a heavy foundation and this is perfect. Creates a flawless finish and works well to cover blemishes. She really liked it. It was a great starter kit.</li>
    <li> Wow for the price this little kit packs a punch of goodies,&lt;br /&gt; The Bisque ( my fav) is awesome for concealing everything!&lt;br /&gt;The shades of foundation although a hair darker,but  I can use it in summer! (I got medium, I should have gotten the light kit) cover beautifully! Very buildable and as long as you know how to apply, directions included, I looks like second skin!&lt;br /&gt;The blush included is TRU, very light color, warmth the face bronzer and blush have a satin shimmer, I prefer matte.&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows included are very nice colors very shimmery, my kit included..DARK SOUL: gunmetal charcoal. CAFE: very very light taupe brown.KHAKI: silvery with slight hint of green. TAN BLISS: burnt orange shimmery, and APRICOT: light peach shimmer. I&#x27;m happy! ..remember  the trick with mineral powder makeup is exfoliating, toning and moisturizing before applying, and also building the coverage with brush then blend, blend, blend! or else you get the caked on powder look, ugh!&lt;br /&gt;No problem with this product, happy happy happy!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell from the picture that they are in very small test size containers. The actually make-up it self is OK. I have used Bare Minerals, Sheer Cover so this product was not too bad. If I had to rate 1.Sheer Cover, 2. IQ and 3. Bare Minerals as last.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this mineral makeup. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My wife says she likes it a lot, then said she actually loves it. It was better than she expected. She told me that she couldn&#x27;t even tell she was wearing any make-up. She is now in the process of ordering more things from this company. I&#x27;m just happy she likes it and that it didn&#x27;t cost that much. I guess now I won&#x27;t have to complain about how much money is being spent on cosmetics.</li>
    <li> fab item, very nice trial set!</li>
    <li> We all know how expensive mineral makeup can be, but this kit gives you all you need at one great price. I only gave it a three because the foundation made me break out. I didn&#x27;t like the cake-y feeling of my face while wearing the makeup.</li>
    <li> This was my first set of mineral makeup and I was very happy with my purchase. Much cheaper than other brands and still great coverage! I will be keeping this brand in mind the next time i order!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and allergies to a lot of cosmetic products. This one was no exception. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, these might work for you though. My skin is just really picky. The concealer that was included in here worked great though. The face powder didn&#x27;t seem to last long though, my skin got really oily with it.If you like glittery eye shadow, you&#x27;ll love these. If you don&#x27;t, stay away from them. They are very shiny and glittery.</li>
    <li> Great color.  Wish it came with a shake cap so it wasn&#x27;t all exposed.  One drop and you will have a huge mess.</li>
    <li> I give this product a neutral review. It is not very good but not bad consider the price.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The foundation is light but gives medium coverage. It shows a good look even after 7 hours of wearing which is more than my expectation. I like the eye shadow colors. The good thing is you can mix the colors to create your own color! I use the darkest eye shadow as brow color.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it doesnt has s stopper, as the instruction states. I wish it could have a better design. I dropped my eye shadow on table and I lost 1/3 of it... :( the foundation powder caused some itch on my cheek but I recover the next day. I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday so it is not a very big problem.</li>
    <li> love it nice  colors and great way to see what is best match</li>
    <li> the make goes on think, it does last a while though. Would suggest does NOT cause acne like base minerals does.</li>
    <li> Background: 21 year old (when I bought this in January. It is now December of the same year) asian woman with a medium pale tone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 11 samples total about 1-2 oz each: five eye shadow colors (with a little bit of sparkle in them), two foundation colors (one shade lighter than the other), one rose blush, one finishing powder veil, one concealer bisque, and one warm face color (bronzer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage: I have been using this product for a year now and still going! To be fair, I didn&#x27;t use it everyday. If used everyday, it might last me about 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Coverage: I didn&#x27;t need a lot of the mineral powder since a little actually covers a decent amount. If you have red acne scars and occasional whiteheads like me, using the foundation will make your acne appear less but will not disappear. The mineral powder is very light and hasn&#x27;t broken me out, so that&#x27;s good! I attribute that to the chemical-free nature of it, which is really why I bought it. :)&lt;br /&gt;As for the length of time it stays on, I find that at the end of the day, it looks like I&#x27;m not wearing anything at all (even with primer!).  I have oily skin though so maybe that&#x27;s just me. Even with the finishing powder I have to do touch-ups throughout the day for my face to look &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s a mineral powder, you can&#x27;t just slab your brush into the container as that will tend to grab too much and fly everywhere. I usually just dip it in lightly and tap off the excess and that works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would buy this again. I am happy to know that I can put on makeup without putting harmful chemicals on my face! What&#x27;s the point of trying to achieve that &amp;#34;healthy glow&amp;#34; if the makeup you put on are actually destroying your skin? So I rated this 4/5 stars, with one star being taken off because unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t stay on all day.</li>
    <li> Product itself is great; however the lids to the containers do not stay on tight.  When I received the product, a couple of the lids had already come loose and the powder was all over the inside of the bag.  These containers don&#x27;t work if you want to carry the makeup around with you, I&#x27;ve tried and half of one of the eye shadows is in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right, so it&#x27;s not a big deal to me to lose some of the powder; however I hope the bigger containers don&#x27;t have the same problem.</li>
    <li> The powders - good...colors - good...containers - YUCK  Who&#x27;s idea was it to put so much of a good thing into so little a jar.  Are You people Out Of Your Mind?????</li>
    <li> At first, I laughed at how small they were, but the quality is in the bristles! Like them better than Bare Minerals brushes.</li>
    <li> This was a great sample kit.  I&#x27;ve tried mineral make up from BE (my skin hated it), Everyday Minerals (like it), Lucy Cosmetics (liked it).  I really really like this make up.  As soon as i figure out what my ideal color will be (Medium? Medium Beige? Medium Beige 2?) i plan to order a full size.  The blush and warmth is also great.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Product is amazing, my skin feels fantastic since switching to IQ naturals mineral make up. My 13 year old daughter and I both love it!</li>
    <li> my first mineral make up, so far love it all, great customer service!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after trying Alima Pure and Everyday Minerals, and it works just as well. The price is really good and there seem to be no toxic ingredients! I would definitely order it again. It is true that the brushes are not the most expensive quality, but they work just as fine, I&#x27;ve had no issues so far. Thanks for a great product and a great price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t compare it to Bare Minerals though.</li>
    <li> The product had a great color , Just way to thick. Very hard to blend in all the way. For the price I should of expected.</li>
    <li> I recieved the item and was excited. I tried it on day one, and hated it. The powder went everywhere the skin color was too light, I ordered medium. The blush is too dark, and the variety of eye shadow was LAME. I even researched this product BEFORE purchasing. I tried this on a different day too see if maybe it would make me happy and less frustrated after giving it a second try. NOPE. The powder fell EVERYWHERE, its all over my floor, my cat, and it got in my eyes. I wear contacts so I do not recommend this, as when you put the shadow on your brush it goes right into your eye. So please, BEWARE before purchasing. Unless you like the powder in your eye and want to scrub your floor everyday, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> i hope the sellers read these reviews. ipurchased his set for a friend in medium dark and the colors were perfect EXCEPT the setting veil is pure white(like baby powder). i had to buy a seperate one and swapped with her. my skin is very,very fair and the white setting veil is to light even for me. Either someone goofed in packing or else its just stupid to put in that white,white shade. IQNaturals should send me (free n no shipping) the proper shade if they have one.Sad.....</li>
    <li> For the price it give alot variety to help the person select what is the best color combination for them or even help create a new combination</li>
    <li> i could not believe the amount of mineral powder you get for this price.  they may look small .....but there is a large amount.  it only takes such a small amount to cover your face.  i would  guess this kit will last for at least 4 to 5 months.  use a larger lid and mix the minerals to match.  blush is fantastic and so is the eye shadow/liner if you use it wet for a liner.  love love and will be buying the larger size</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I just ordered the samples, and not the larger foundation. The IQ foundation was a huge disappointment. It does not last, and rubs off easily. It tends to separate on my face. After just three hours it looked horrible! I would not recommend this to anyone. The eye shadows are nice though.</li>
    <li> This is a great trial size set, It is complete with brushes. Def worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this make up it is all I need to have flawless almost perfect look.  It can get messy but once you get use to using it will come natural to you and the messy goes away.  Thank you for a great affordable product.</li>
    <li> I give this a 4 star rating. Im inlove with everything it came with. Even tho there a bit small they last a long time. Im happy with it and plan on buying more :)</li>
    <li> Great coverage.  awesome  colors . The tubs are a little  small to work with but so far love it</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in good condition... Containers were smaller than expected... They&#x27;re more like a trial size to see how you like the product. Wasn&#x27;t my favorite make-up but everyone likes different things &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use all the pieces. I use the two foundations as spot treatments and my skin looks flawless. No one knows I&#x27;m wearing makeup and unlike other foundations it doesn&#x27;t make my skin worse when I use it. It&#x27;s really light but it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Good buy pretty colored eyeshadow and the powders have a decent amount of coverage</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with these samples. The colors are long lasting and the foundation is just as good as bare minerals. I&#x27;ll order it again</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase.  I read the other reviews and thought for the price I would give it a shot.  For it being just a sample set, you get a lot, and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how my skin looks glowing. I love how light it feels on my skin and lasts all day. I would definitely recommend buying, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I am so happy this make up does not have bismuth in the ingredients.  bismuth is why I had to stop using bare minerals, it wreck havoc on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my goodness you get so many colors to sample!  I ordered the medium and this review is about the 3 medium foundation shades that come with the kit.  they are each just slightly different: one is the basic medium that is very much like the color of bareminerals medium.  the other has more of a beige undertone and the 3rd has a bit of yellow undertone. All 3 looked good on my skin the regular medium being the best match for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on my skin and covers nicely.  Do use a gentle hand, you can always buff in more. I read the reviews that this coverage is more complete or heavy than other mineral make-ups so to me that means use a gentle hand, just pick up a tiny amount on the brush and swirl and tap it off a lot before applying!&lt;br /&gt;I ended up combining all three into another jar and feel this is a perfect color for me during high summer.  : )  I finish off with their&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Flawless Spritz&amp;#34; Makeup Setting Spray, and I am set! beautiful coverage that lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several days use I feel my skin is in better shape, with less rosaea and more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely repurchase this sample pack  and get the larger jar of medium for winter.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try mineral make-up and this was the perfect kit. The brushes and make-up are high quality. I was afraid that adding power to my  face would  accentuate  any wrinkles, but this didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m glad I tried them!</li>
    <li> the samples are very small but the product itself is fantastic! i absolutely love the sheer of these minerals on my skin! and no chemicals! it is the best mineral make up i have tried so far.</li>
    <li> It was great exactly what was said in the ad. Thank you</li>
