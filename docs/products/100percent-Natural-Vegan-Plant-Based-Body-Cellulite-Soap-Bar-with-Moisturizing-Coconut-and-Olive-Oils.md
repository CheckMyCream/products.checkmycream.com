<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Finulite anti cellulite work for my recommend AAA+</li>
    <li> This stuff actually worked, i believe!</li>
    <li> Just received this 2 days ago so its too early to tell how well it will work. However it arrived very quickly, was packaged very carefully and smells wonderful. My skin does feel a little softer....so far so good!!!</li>
    <li> It works been using this for about 3 weeks  now no lie I saw a difference just a few days ago but I am also walking and doing some light jogging that does help reduce fat I brelieve u canr just depend on creams not soaps u gave to incorporate exercise even if u start off with fat walking. I started usein the am pm finulite too this will or should make the process better....</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help at all get rid of my cellulite :(</li>
    <li> I used for about a week when my legs began developing acne. I stopped using this and they&#x27;ve gone back to normal.</li>
    <li> This soap really lathers well in the shower I looooove that! Really good with the body brush I bought.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any significant changes yet only been using a week,  but the product smells really great and definitely feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> I just got it today and it smells amazing! I used it one time today about 3 mins on each leg and on back of arms and it made everything so smooth! Very nice product!! Will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> OMG! First off I ordered this particular product because I was curious and wanted to know if it worked since so many others claimed to do so. It came within the 4th day that I order. The speed of delivery was amazing. I didn&#x27;t have to wait for like 15 days but anyway once I opened the package I was blessed by that peppermint scent which made me run and go take a bath just to know how it expound feel on my skin and I could honestly say I loved it. Perfect in every way. Does all that it says it does especially since hair grows on my face more than most women. It heeled a lot worth ingrown hairs and blemishes</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s seems ok as a soap and I don&#x27;t see any difference on my cellulite.Other that this it&#x27;s nice exfoliating soap.</li>
    <li> Lathers nice and smells pleasant, but does not work against cellulite</li>
    <li> Feel refreshing. Will continue to buy in the future</li>
    <li> love this ...it works</li>
    <li> The soap is awesome.  Makes my skin so soft and very moisturized. I use it with the Finulite cream and mitt and I could not be happier! Will be sporting my bikini this summer at the beach. Yay!</li>
    <li> This soap left my skin feeling firm and soft after one use! (With the assistance of a mit) I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> This soap is really works. I have been using this soap for the 4 month period. And my legs start looking and filling much smoother, I can start wearing the shorts now. The key is to use it at least every other day regime. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> It was cruelty free and came early, when i used it it felt great my skin felt AMAZING, had everything in it&#x27;s packaging, a great size to hold in your hand. It dries well and I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again when i get the money!&lt;br /&gt;This not being a fault of product if you&#x27;re in an area with more calcium in the water it&#x27;ll accumulate at the top of the tub(it&#x27;ll do that for many products not just this)</li>
    <li> Mesh bag that comes with soap not the best quality.  I put it another one that I have that is more durable.  Like soap overall.  Good lather and works well with my hand held massage scrubber. Have noticeable results when used with the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream.</li>
    <li> I bought the first bar of Finulite Anti Cellulite Soap when my wife turned 50 and complained that things that never seemed to be a problem were now suddenly something that have become a concern like, wrinkles, some very small age spots and some cellulite that was never that bad...but did bother her tremendously. I read the feedback from others about this soap, and saw a great deal involving a scrub brush where you could try this soap for free and decided to fight this problem with trying this product sense it had gotten such great reviews. During the first week she didn&#x27;t have much to say and was busy using the soap and brush in a diligent way. During the second week she said how great the soap felt, how well it lathered up and started to see that a lot of the cellulite had become smaller and...amazingly enough...some of it disappeared and she was so thrilled I decided to buy her more in efforts that the rest would disappear as well! I do believe that the combination of this soap and the cellulite brush...with the same brand name of Finulite did make a difference and really didn&#x27;t need anything else. I believe someday she will ask to look into the am and pm lotions that also go into fighting cellulite. For now she is very happy with the results she is getting from these two products and will continue to buy on a regular basis! The lotions will be looked into ...but these do well enough for now and seems to be giving desirable results! GREAT PURCHASE! Update: I just bought my wife&#x27;s next purchase of 3 bars of soap and they have just arrived today. All arrived just as the first bar did with wrapping and a mesh bag that really does help the soap last longer! She hangs it up to keep out of water and away from other forces that could make its life much shorter. She has just ordered her first tubes of the Finulite am/pm lotions and is eager to find out what these can do to accomplish her goals of , less to no, cellulite. She will be eager to write feedback after it is tried to inform future purchasers when making the decision on buying this item. At this point all thumbs up for Finulite products! Thank you Simply Skin!</li>
    <li> Dried out my skin. No noticeable benefits.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any results yet from this soap, but I don&#x27;t use it every time. I like how it makes me feel real clean, and enjoy the fact that its natural. I would buy it again, just due to that... I will start using it more often &amp; post another review if I start seeing results.</li>
    <li> will buy again. I see improvement throughout first weeks.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it helps with cellulite, but it sure does smell great, and feels great too!</li>
    <li> This soap smells beautiful and leaves the skin with an amazing softness. I haven&#x27;t tried enough time to give an honest review regarding &amp;#34;cellulite results&amp;#34;, but I will report back in a week.</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t see no improvement</li>

    <li> Smells amazing, feels refreshing, totally preps your skin for the finulite lotions! Nothing I&#x27;ve tried works as well and as quick as finulite! Love this product!</li>
    <li> Great lathering soap, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I&#x27;ve been rapidly losing weight, and I&#x27;ve now lost about 80lbs in the last 6 months. I instantly noticed that my skin felt tighter after using it. Continued use has really helped improve the appearance and feel of my skin, but I still mostly notice how effectively it tightens my skin. I&#x27;ll absolutely continue  buying this product.</li>
    <li> Love love love this. Smells great and leaves skin feeling clean and tightened. Use this in shower and the finūlite cellulite am/pm lotions when u get out and watch the results appear. I&#x27;ve been using these for over a month now, and I am a lifetime buyer now.</li>
    <li> Seems just an okay soap don&#x27;t see much of a difference. The smells is not to over bearing.</li>
    <li> Please see my review for Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt.  This Exfoliating Soap Bar was offered as a FREE product with my order of the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt as a Limited-Time ONLY Offer.  I am impressed with the offer, the contents in this product, as well as a mesh pouch that can be used while working on cellulite areas of your body, or to store the soap after each daily/weekly use.</li>
    <li> First of all it smells great! The mesh pouch that comes with the soap is great for gently exfoliating and making a wonderful sudsy-foam. It does NOT leave a waxy film on your skin like most $4 soaps from CVS. Any reduction in cellulite appearance would be a bonus lol</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling very smooth and tight</li>
    <li> Dose not worth to buy</li>
    <li> After turning 30 this year I noticed a huge difference in the elasticity &amp; texture, plus cellulite to my skin in my thigh and hamstring area. I&#x27;ve had enough, working out hard just wasn&#x27;t enough. Which put me on the search to get some extra help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am so glad I can across this product on Amazon. Since my purchase 3 weeks ago I have used this soap daily all over my body really. There has been a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin. I even gave a bar to my sister who was skeptical but she now sees it too even after limited use. Other than it really working, it smells fresh, zero residue &amp; long lasting. I bought 3 bars and I&#x27;m still on my first. I love how every package of soap they give you a mesh baggy with a string. I just wrap the string around my wrist and scrub away. Plus it makes it easy to hang on my shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this product and I will definitely stock up on this and use for a lifetime!!!! Thank you Finulite</li>
    <li> This is fine if you just want a body soap. Has a nice lather &amp; gentle exfoliation. But if you&#x27;re looking for deep exfoliation, cellulite reduction you&#x27;re not going to get it with this bar. I get better results with coffee scrubs; I bought this bar hoping to get similar results without the mess of a scrub. So back to the scrubs for me.</li>
    <li> I am a 32 active woman with cellulite.  I eat clean and work out regularly. Along with that I use the finulite cream, dry brush and this soap. My cellulite has greatly diminished.  I really like finlite products and have never had a problem with an order.</li>
    <li> I believe this is helping with my cellulite. I plan to buy and see for sure.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing.  I used it the same day I received it  and everyday day since.  I love the way my skin feels after the shower.  Getting a few more to give the women in my family and as gifts for my girlfriends!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t use bar soap but I have used and love the other products from this company so I decided to try it out. Much to my suprise it has become A favorite. It lathers really well and makes my skin look super smooth.</li>
    <li> Love the soap. Use with finulite cream and massage mitt!</li>
    <li> Just received this soap the packaging was very nicely done it comes with a case for the soap</li>
    <li> This soap is very refreshing and smell very nice.  But other than that is not very helpful getting rid of cellulite.</li>
    <li> It brighten and soften my skin but I still have cellulite. It actually removed some spots I had on my butt whitch I like but the cellulite still cilling on my legs lol I thank u for what it did do</li>
    <li> Lathers better than any soap I have ever used. Smells good and does seem to make my skin firmer! Love this soap!! :-)</li>
