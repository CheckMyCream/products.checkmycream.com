      <li>Just make sure you peel off the brown protective paper.</li>

      <li>It is true.</li>
      <li>Other than that I&#x27;m happy to have it</li>
      <li>They responded quickly and corrected their mistake.</li>
      <li>First I am ossiliate between the original One that is 19.99 bucks and this cheaper version.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So, it&#x27;s not up to my aesthetic standards, but it is practical and useful.</li>
      <li>I have upped my rating as they were kind enough to contact me to rectify the problem.</li>
      <li>I made the right decision.</li>
      <li>: I received an entirely new product very quickly with no problems.</li>
      <li>Did dry the brushes nicely anyway</li>
      <li>Makes it easy to dry my brushes and easy to store.  </li>
      <li>I love the black finish of the brush stand/tree and how easy it was to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super basic though, to the point that it easily comes apart.</li>
      <li>Thanks BESTOPE!</li>
      <li>Just used this for the first time today.  </li>
      <li>But does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
      <li>Most companies do not care about their customers however Bestope is different.</li>
      <li>I love that it has multiple size holes for all my brushes.</li>
      <li>and I have been able to trust in their service/quality for several years now.  </li>
      <li>Every time I try to pull out a brush it pulls the entire top plate</li>
      <li>: Be aware that the packaging may be deceiving.</li>
      <li>Such a great way to let brushes dry without making the bristles all funky.</li>
      <li>This is perfect, I Wash my brushes from BESTOPE in Dawn/Oxy, and put them in the rack, then put the rack on the stand, they dry in less than an hour!  </li>
      <li>Easy set up and break down, holds brushes securely.</li>
      <li>I love that my brushes now have a place to hang while waiting to dry.</li>
      <li>They are easily detachable since they slide in together, but don&#x27;t worry it won&#x27;t come apart unless you&#x27;re actually taking it apart.</li>
      <li>With the tree my brushes are able to regain their from and dry so much faster.</li>
      <li>My brushes dry so fast I love it.</li>
      <li>Very durable.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really gray.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to take up my whole bathroom counter drying brushes.</li>
      <li>The openings are very sturdy so your brushes will stay straight and not flop around.</li>
      <li>Some of my large handled brushes do not fit but that&#x27;s ok because all my other brushes fit and dried so nicely.</li>
      <li>The product also smells highly of glue.</li>
      <li>Other than my &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; missing the line that crosses it, everything else was great.</li>
      <li>I did not have a brush that I cleaned today that did not fit into one of the many sized holes..  </li>
      <li>It breaks down into 3 pieces for easy storage.  </li>
      <li>I received my order in a pretty decent amount, it was a combined order with a different seller as well.</li>
      <li>: The seller reached out to me and said she will send me a new one.</li>
      <li>You can only pick it up from the vary top and mine didn&#x27;t even come black.</li>
      <li>I fixed it with glue  </li>
      <li>Complete junk.</li>
      <li>As a professional makeup artist I wash my brushes often.</li>
      <li>Slots are small not for big brushes and frame is kind loose</li>
      <li>If I get the new item with no problems, they will definitely be getting 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I believe it would be much better if the top (the tray section) would lock into place to the base.</li>
      <li>Fits a wide range  of brushes and makes the drying process so much easier.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it&#x27;s not black as shown.</li>

<li> Before I&#x27;d wash them, use a paper towel to blot dry and then lay them flat out on the counter and it would take FOREVER for them all to dry.</li>
<li> My only issue is the plastic is very thin and when I tried to remove a few brushes, the top part broke.</li>
<li> It seriously makes cleaning ALL of my brushes so much easier.</li>
<li> I have a lot of different makeup brushes and I like the idea of hanging them upside down for them to dry.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not really stable.</li>
<li> Now my brush will dry faster!!</li>
<li> Now, I just wash, blot dry and insert them into the slots and they&#x27;re dry in a few hours.</li>
<li> The bushes don&#x27;t lose shape when being dried like this which is always an issue when drying on a flat surface.</li>
<li> Other than that it served its purpose.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works beautifully. Easy set up and break down, holds brushes securely.</li>
    <li> Item works as described. It could be a little sturdier and the brushes are a Tad difficult to get in without holder the base. But overall it does what is expected. Would give 4 stars if the standard itself was taller.</li>
    <li> I only received the brush holder not the stand. It&#x27;s also to small. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I waited a week and a half for this to come and I have to send it back.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I need it to!, and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space!!</li>
    <li> Broke already..haven&#x27;t even used it once yet. Cheap quality.</li>
    <li> This company has some of the best customer service.Most companies do not care about their customers however Bestope is different. The product its self is beautiful.It is sleek and black. As a professional makeup artist I wash my brushes often. With the tree my brushes are able to regain their from and dry so much faster.</li>
    <li> Could not be more pleased!! My brushes dry so fast I love it. Some of my large handled brushes do not fit but that&#x27;s ok because all my other brushes fit and dried so nicely. The bushes don&#x27;t lose shape when being dried like this which is always an issue when drying on a flat surface. I may order a second one for when I do all my brushes at once.</li>
    <li> This is work. First I am ossiliate between the original One that is 19.99 bucks and this cheaper version.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this cheaper one in the hope that It will turn out great. It is true. I made the right decision. I have no idea how better the more pricy one can do.</li>
    <li> Love this tool as well I have a lot of different makeup brushes and I like the idea of hanging them upside down for them to dry. It is guarantees that your brushes will dry the proper way!!</li>
    <li> Love this, getting another today!  Read someone say it was small, not sure how big you think a brush drying rack should be??  This is perfect, I Wash my brushes from BESTOPE in Dawn/Oxy, and put them in the rack, then put the rack on the stand, they dry in less than an hour!  BESTOPE is the best and I have been able to trust in their service/quality for several years now.  Thanks BESTOPE!</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it&#x27;s not black as shown. It&#x27;s got ugly brown paper on it and I don&#x27;t see a way to remove it. The product also smells highly of glue. Other than that I&#x27;m happy to have it so I don&#x27;t have to take up my whole bathroom counter drying brushes.</li>
    <li> Not the color in picture it&#x27;s really gray. But does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
    <li> Easy to put together and does the job! Makes cleaning brushes more tolerable!</li>
    <li> Fits a wide range  of brushes and makes the drying process so much easier.  Collapses for easy storage.</li>
    <li> PROS: I really do love the concept of this Makeup Brush Drying kit. It works well, it is made out of sturdy material that you can easily put together and break apart. I am satisfied with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Be aware that the packaging may be deceiving. Instead of the plastic, black material I thought it would have been as shown in the picture. Mine turned out to have brown cardboard-like material as its finish. Which is why I took off a star. So, it&#x27;s not up to my aesthetic standards, but it is practical and useful.</li>
    <li> It was a gift, but I think she likes it!</li>
    <li> Does it com with the brushes???</li>
    <li> Great stand for the price! Just make sure you peel off the brown protective paper. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Why did I hesitate to get one of these??? This thing is awesome!! It seriously makes cleaning ALL of my brushes so much easier. Before I&#x27;d wash them, use a paper towel to blot dry and then lay them flat out on the counter and it would take FOREVER for them all to dry. Now, I just wash, blot dry and insert them into the slots and they&#x27;re dry in a few hours. The best part is that its collapsible so when I&#x27;m not using it, I just put it away in a drawer unit the next use.</li>
    <li> I love that my brushes now have a place to hang while waiting to dry. The brown sticker layer was a little stinky and difficult to remove. My daughter was helping me remove it around the letters and a piece of it chipped off. Other than my &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; missing the line that crosses it, everything else was great. I love the black finish of the brush stand/tree and how easy it was to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to mention that the stand itself is a tad bit flimsy but it&#x27;s also a pro if you would like to pull it apart and put it away after using.</li>
    <li> Works well, stores in very small space.  I use it weekly.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how wobbly it is. Once you put it together it&#x27;s not really stable. It&#x27;s not going to fall apart on its own but still not sturdy.</li>
    <li> I just opens my package an I only received the top part not too happy</li>
    <li> I like it because its better than laying brushes out on a towel and saved space. It&#x27;s super basic though, to the point that it easily comes apart. You can only pick it up from the vary top and mine didn&#x27;t even come black. It&#x27;s brown cardboard colored. Not something I want exposed for all to see. Other than that it served its purpose. Just wish the quality was a bit prettier. It should for sure be cheaper for what it is like 50% cheaper!</li>
    <li> I am missing a piece. The stand only has one leg. I can&#x27;t use it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**edit: The seller reached out to me and said she will send me a new one. I have upped my rating as they were kind enough to contact me to rectify the problem. If I get the new item with no problems, they will definitely be getting 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***update: I received an entirely new product very quickly with no problems. They responded quickly and corrected their mistake. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Now my brush will dry faster!!</li>
    <li> I believe it would be much better if the top (the tray section) would lock into place to the base. Every time I try to pull out a brush it pulls the entire top plate and it requires 2 hands to put in and pull out and brush. Over all, it holds the brushes like it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> I received my order in a pretty decent amount, it was a combined order with a different seller as well. The product itself is very good. It comes in 3 separate pieces. They are easily detachable since they slide in together, but don&#x27;t worry it won&#x27;t come apart unless you&#x27;re actually taking it apart. The material is a very sturdy hard plastic. The openings are very sturdy so your brushes will stay straight and not flop around. This product was great and the most affordable I found.  Go for it!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Makes it easy to dry my brushes and easy to store.  Great if you have several makeup brushes.  The base has slots to keep it standing.  If moving it grab it by the top part or else it collapses.  Would buy again if I ever lost it.  Very durable.  Stores away nicely.</li>
    <li> Complete junk. Came with one part of the stand missing. Save your $$s</li>
    <li> Nice idea. Think I&#x27;m missing a piece not sure. Did dry the brushes nicely anyway just had to improvise....</li>
    <li> Loved mine so I bought an additional one as a gift.  It is well loved by her as well!</li>
    <li> Just used this for the first time today.  It works as advertised.  Excellent hold of brushes in stand and holes are varying sizes for various size brushes. They do not slip out or move.  I did not have a brush that I cleaned today that did not fit into one of the many sized holes..  It breaks down into 3 pieces for easy storage.  In the pic are the Magik Makeup protectors, to maintain the form of the bristles on the the USPICY set of 32 makeup brushes. There are a few odd brushes in there from my travel kit. But mostly the USPICY brushes.  All purchased on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! Such a great way to let brushes dry without making the bristles all funky. I love that it has multiple size holes for all my brushes. Even better that it&#x27;s collapsible for storage.&lt;br /&gt;The brown protective cover&#x27;s were pretty easy to pull off. Some people have mentioned a weird smell, but my husband (who works with plastics) assured me that it&#x27;s just the way plastic smells. After taking the covering off and just letting it air out the smell went away.</li>
    <li> Holds brushes very securely. My only issue is the plastic is very thin and when I tried to remove a few brushes, the top part broke. I fixed it with glue  but needless to say, I was sad that it was so flimsy.</li>
    <li> I I love the product and good customer service. Thank you again</li>
    <li> Slots are small not for big brushes and frame is kind loose</li>
</ol>
