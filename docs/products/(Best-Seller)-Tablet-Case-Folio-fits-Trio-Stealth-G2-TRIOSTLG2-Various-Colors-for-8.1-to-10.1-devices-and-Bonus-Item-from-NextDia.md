    <li> Nice case but I was hoping that since it was FOR a Trio Stealth G2 that it would actually have the camera hole in the right place so I didn&#x27;t have to take my tablet out of the case every time I wanted to take a pic</li>
    <li> These are great cases. I bought them for the tablets that my Grandkids got for Christmas. If they can&#x27;t wreck them, no can.</li>
    <li> Excellent tablet protector</li>
    <li> This fit my Trio perfectly,also you have a better grip on your tablet.I &#x27;m glad the tablet is well protected now from breakage!</li>
    <li> I its perfect for my 10 in tablet....It was a good buy I like it..keeps the glass safe from damage</li>
    <li> HATE this cover!!!! The clasps on the side do not hold the tablet in so it falls out all the time. The stand up feature doesn&#x27;t work, VERY FLIMSY!!! Went cheap and GOT CHEAP!!!! Threw it in the garbage and went to Best Buy!!&amp;#34;&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The case is good and does its job, but the clips keep slipping off. And I haven&#x27;t found many other options for colors.</li>
    <li> The tabs to hold the tablet keep slipping off. They let the tablet slip around rather than hold it tight.</li>
    <li> For the Price it offers More Protection Than the Soft Cases, But, The Tablet Fell From the Arm of a Recliner &amp; the Screen Still Cracked Because the Case Doesn&#x27;t Lock.  if you Have Children or Pets, I Suggest a Case With a Locking Latch</li>
    <li> The cover is nice but the fact that it was suppose to come with a free bonus stylus and it didn&#x27;t was a let down...</li>
    <li> Nice case. Fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought an 8&amp;#34; Zeki android.  Was hard to find something for an 8&amp;#34; screen so I went with this.  It is ok but not very stable sitting up.  At least it will help protect it if I drop it.</li>
    <li> The  holding latch cover on and off volume control.  It slips off constantly. i would not recommend. They didnt consider compotent t design</li>
    <li> I was totally disappointed.  One of the straps pulled out within two days.  I would have sent it back but I had already thrown the bag away and box with all the Christmas paper.  Definitely would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Case is fine. Amazon did not send bonus gift (stylus) with it.</li>
    <li> I HAD MY TABLET IN THE CASE AND IT STILL CAME OUT OF IT AND THE SCREEN SHATTERED ON MY FLOOR</li>
    <li> It fits my trio stealth g4 10.1 the clamps are tight but because it slips easily from the corners it may not be that good for carrying around.</li>
    <li> Love it was what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Item fits good and looks good&lt;br /&gt;Wish that there was a better selection of color like black one red is ok</li>
    <li> These are ok.  They don&#x27;t really fit our tablets and the fasteners keep moving all over the place.</li>
