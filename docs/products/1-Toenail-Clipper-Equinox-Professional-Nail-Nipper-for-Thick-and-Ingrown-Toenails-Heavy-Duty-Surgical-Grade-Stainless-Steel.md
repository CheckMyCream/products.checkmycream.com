      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>it gives you a precise cut every single time and it&#x27;s easy to carry</li>
      <li>The Equinox did exactly what I needed it to do for me.  </li>
      <li>Nice and sharp as described.</li>
      <li>but they certainly aren&#x27;t doing the job for me.</li>
      <li>The jaws open wide enough and the handles give a person good traction to easily clip the nail.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend buying!</li>

      <li>Excellent materials and product but a little too small for my large hands.</li>
      <li>The edges do a clean cut through and allowed me to simply pull out the remained.  </li>
      <li>The material is amazing and these will definitely last a long time!</li>
      <li>Decent as a cuticle trimmer, but does NOT cut nails at all.</li>
      <li>This gives you better precision than the normal nail clipper and is straight lined and not curved to get those little pieces that you may miss otherwise.</li>
      <li>does the job, but would be a little better if blade was curved</li>
      <li>I really liked this tool its made of very durable metal and will clip very hard nails.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to squeeze so hard for them to clip them very easy.</li>

    <li> It  is a great Clipper the ever. Thank you very much. Bob</li>
    <li> These clippers are sharp and they work great! They also work great for your cuticles. The material is amazing and these will definitely last a long time! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Less heavy duty nail clipper, good for hangnails. Doesn&#x27;t open as wide. The middle clasp swings forward so it can get the clipping movement working. And then you can swing/fold it back down to shut the clippers. These are a smaller toenail clipper than other versions. I like it because it&#x27;s not as heavy duty as some and served my purpose nicely, to cut hangnails. Has a slimmer nose.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp as described.</li>
    <li> They work great -  I went to a nearby store and got a toe nail clipper but did not work for me -  but this Equinox Professional toenail clipper works real nice for my thick toe nails -  heavy duty and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Product worked very poorly as a toe nail clipper. I cannot rate it with any stars.</li>
    <li> Not big enough for thick toenails.</li>
    <li> i think it was poorly made and did not work as it should have for the price paid, i would not recommend it.  i sent mine back!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably just me, but these just don&#x27;t seem to do the job.They&#x27;re awkward to use and they don&#x27;t cut well enough to suit me. However, I&#x27;ve developed curving toenails that seem to be a problem no matter what I try, so I definitely wouldn&#x27;t say not to buy these. They just weren&#x27;t right for me.</li>
    <li> These nippers do have excellent workmanship in that the edges are keenly honed, the points are precision ground, the handles are the right size for my averaged-sized hand.  Also these nippers are made from quality stainless steel.  All in all, I believe that I have the right product at the right price.</li>
    <li> great pair of clippers use for adults and the kids. with out a doubt a great pair of clippers.</li>
    <li> I suffer from horrible in grown toenails.  I have had medical advice but in the end purchased this product.  This is how I spell relief</li>
    <li> Last pair &#x27;borrowed&#x27; and missing when I needed them [btw they showed up two days after I needed them ]&lt;br /&gt;So Now I have a much better quality pair of my own in my private pedicure kit&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for offering these on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This device is so dull that it won&#x27;t cut through my toenails or my fingernails. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Expectations for product was met</li>
    <li> the tip could be sharper</li>
    <li> Takes a lot of effort to cut my nails!</li>
    <li> There is a gap in the blades.The only part of the trimmers you can use is the very tip which makes them almost useless.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t even cut paper, sent it back and got reimbursed.</li>
    <li> DULL! If you have thick, ingrown toenails DO NOT BUY THESE. It won&#x27;t cut big, thick, curving toenails; and it slips when you squeeze them.</li>
    <li> I mistakenly ordered 2 toenail clippers, but Equinox refunded me for the second pair without&lt;br /&gt;any question or fuss.  VERY GOOD SERVICE.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> Far too small.  Can&#x27;t get enough leverage to cut through the nails.  Buy the larger one with rubber grips.</li>
    <li> They work great. These clippers are easy to grip and keep in your hand and easy to trigger.&lt;br /&gt;works real nice on my thick toe nails</li>
    <li> Poor quality: the tips of the clippers bend easily, rendering them ineffective on all but the most delicate of nails.</li>
    <li> LOOKED FOR GREAT CLIPPERS FOR A LONG TIME--THESE ARE THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED THANK YOU EQUINOX!</li>
    <li> Well made but the blades are too long. It gets the job done. The price makes it worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent product overall. Durable quality and easy to use. The cutter is sharp, I just don&#x27;t know how long will it last before it becomes dull, but I think we shall see! :)</li>
    <li> Works fine.  Works best when the toes are soaked.</li>
    <li> good for horse nail.  heavy oackward.</li>
    <li> does the job, but would be a little better if blade was curved</li>
    <li> Super sharp. High grade! Cuts very easily. Highly recommend buying!</li>
    <li> Looks impressive but not very good on my tough old toenails. Would benefit from having longer cutting blades and a spring opener.</li>
    <li> This thing works great!  It allows you to carefully dig and remove like no other clipper I have had.  Already did ingrown toenail surgery on one big toe.  I think this will keep me out of the doctors office!  Be careful it is sharp!</li>
    <li> This item took care of my toe nail problems with its precise edges.</li>
    <li> Unable to use the product...nails too thick</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I tend to get an ingrown toe nail.  I needed an above average nail clipper and it had to have very sharp tips to cut through the edge and be able to pull the remainder out (sorry for the very detail visual description but I wanted to let you know what I use it for and how it has worked for me).  The Equinox did exactly what I needed it to do for me.  The edges do a clean cut through and allowed me to simply pull out the remained.  The blade is sharp in its entirety (not just in the center thicker part).  I have to admit that I don&#x27;t have very thick nails, so I couldn&#x27;t tell you how it would work if that is what you were looking for, I can&#x27;t attest to that, but I CAN say that the tool is very sturdy, you can tell is made well, of quality material.&lt;br /&gt;Not yet sure if it is right for you?  It has a 30 day money back guarantee, that makes it worth trying (more than I can say from any pharmacy bought nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my opinion.</li>
    <li> so far so good its see if they will last a little while and to stay sharp</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this clipper after reading all the positive reviews. I used it a few times and then threw out.  Sharp in the wrong places (the points) and not sharp in the blades.  You could puncture yourself easily with these and they don&#x27;t cut toe nails very well.</li>
    <li> I ordered the nail cutters but received a plastic sheath....no nail-cutters! Quite UN-happy.</li>
    <li> Very well made, excellent buy. Hard to find a good heavy duty nail nipper. Hope it lasts as long as it looks like it will.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Excellent pre and post-sale follow-up and timely shipping.</li>
    <li> The clippers I received do not fully close along the full length of their cutting edges. The tips of the cutting edges meet but that&#x27;s it. I used these clippers one time but, they did an inadequate job of cutting and resulted in jagged, torn nails. Overall, these seem sturdy and well made--just poorly aligned along the cutting edges. Waste of time and money. Will visit physical retailer (e.g., Rite Aid, CVS, Walgreens or mom-and-pop supplier) so I can see what I&#x27;m getting.</li>
    <li> I really liked this tool its made of very durable metal and will clip very hard nails. I got it for my Mom who has thicker nails and its amazing</li>
    <li> Very solid purchase.  Used to clip ingrown toenail on big toe that has fungus infection.  Cannot use medication to fix due to side effect of possible liver damage so have to live with it.</li>
    <li> The cutting blades did not come together to cut the toenail properly. I expected a well made tool and got a poorly constructed one. I sent it back.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. So happy to have found it.</li>
    <li> This is much smaller than I expected. The quality seems to very good, but will get another clipper that is larger and meets my needs better.</li>
    <li> Too small. Thought it to be bigger. Probably works well for a toddler.</li>
    <li> As advertised, delivery timely, packaged well. Am satisfied</li>
    <li> Better than the nail shop</li>
    <li> Item arrived as stated.</li>
    <li> Very good but did not cut the thickest, disgusting toe nails.</li>
    <li> I have very thick toenails and have never been able to clip them with a regular toenail clipper. This one works great. The jaws open wide enough and the handles give a person good traction to easily clip the nail.</li>
    <li> Not very sharp...  But but the material is very good and well-built.</li>
    <li> This clipper works great. My wife has been undergoing chemo therapy treatment for 4 years, which causes her toenails to become thick and tough. I have struggled with other nail trimmers with limited success. This trimmer works wonderfully. The sharp, pointed cutting blades made quick work of an normally difficult task.</li>
    <li> Tiny!  A toy and too small to be of any use.</li>
    <li> Good product, and excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Decent as a cuticle trimmer, but does NOT cut nails at all.</li>
    <li> worked on my hubbys gross thick nails</li>
    <li> Better than expected..&lt;br /&gt;I like the clippers!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I was hoping these were the heavy duty type clippers that my podiatrist has.  But unfortunately, they are not.  They do not cut through my nails very well at all.  Maybe I just have thicker nails than all the others giving this a good review?  I don&#x27;t know but they certainly aren&#x27;t doing the job for me.</li>
    <li> Very sharp but still have to work at it to get them to cut.</li>
    <li> A little light weight.........won&#x27;t do the toughest nails with ease as described.</li>
    <li> cuts toenails, but just regular nails. the thick toenails are too much for this little guy. keep the nails thin and this works fine.</li>
    <li> Not as advertised. Not strong enough to clip thick toenails.</li>
    <li> great quality. strong, easy to use , love the style and the size . easy to grab. my whole family uses it. it replaced the other  toe nail clippers we had in the house. can use it on adults and children toe nails. thank you for letting me try your product for little money</li>
    <li> Fraud, terrible product. Very dull, will not cut anything. Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and worked even better than I expected.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great quality, very easy and comfortable to grip (a problem I&#x27;ve had in the past with toenail clippers) Cuts the nail with precision. Simply a great product.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed! It doesn&#x27;t cut! -- just like the cheap crap from the dollar store!!!!!</li>
    <li> Well-made product, but smaller than I anticipated.  Works well on most nails, but doesn&#x27;t cut it for my husband&#x27;s big toenails that are hard, thick and curved.  We kept it for his other nails, but it doesn&#x27;t work for the purpose that we bought it.</li>
    <li> Finally!  Someone has come out with a straight edge clipper for ingrown toenails that works. It&#x27;s easy to handle and sharp enough to cut even tough, thick nails.  Others I&#x27;ve tried either didn&#x27;t work or were too expensive.  Thanks for a great product and super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> End of clippers is very sharp and pointy.&lt;br /&gt;They do a good job of cutting thick nails.</li>
    <li> great for ingrown toenails to clip that side peace that digs in the side of your toe.</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted.  Returned.</li>
    <li> No problem clipping nails now.</li>
    <li> Great, as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with clippers, however, I ordered two(2) pairs of clippers and I only received one(1) pair.&lt;br /&gt;Please advise&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;Tom Walker</li>
    <li> Ordered two and when I reserved my package after a long wait they were different sizes. Don&#x27;t know why. At least they are sharp. Seems like good quality.</li>
    <li> Great Toenail Clippers - allows me to properly care for toenail maintenance.</li>
    <li> Delivery on time and in good shape. Tried it on a very thick and long toe nail, worked like a charm. The handles are smooth and I discovered  it is  hard for me to hang on to them.  They need some sort of non-skid.  They are smaller than I expected but no problem.</li>
    <li> really needed a sturdier one.</li>
    <li> My husband liked it a lot good product came on scheduled.</li>
    <li> These toe nail clippers are a must have especially if you do at home pedicures. These are sturdy and &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; the toe nail wonderfully. This gives you better precision than the normal nail clipper and is straight lined and not curved to get those little pieces that you may miss otherwise. They feel good in your hand and it doesn&#x27;t take much force to make a cut. My toes look professionally groomed because of these clippers and they save me money by not having to go get them done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these toe nail clippers at a promotional price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> certainly is sharp, have to watch when cutting,</li>
    <li> Sharp but smaller then expected</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s get one thing clear: this thing is to regular nail clippers as a chainsaw is to a pair of garden shears. It&#x27;s basically a wire cutter sized and shaped for your toenails. Which is a good thing, since after having broken several of my toenails off multiple times due to various skiing and lovemaking accidents, they had grown in so thick, tough, and curved that they&#x27;d give a velociraptor performance issues. Although it took significant effort, these things cut through nail thick enough to be measured with a ruler and helped to dig out nail edges that were beginning to become ingrown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have nasty-arse, disgusting claws on your feet, these will be able to take them on.</li>
    <li> This is smaller then I somehow expected.  That is seems small in my hands but it works OK. You need to be careful when you use it as it is sharp.</li>
    <li> Too much of a gap when fully closed. Wont cut nails all the way through. The tip does close all the way but that is the only part that does. Works great for hang nails and that&#x27;s about it</li>
    <li> Very very good toenail clippers very sturdy very useful and doesn&#x27;t break tried many in the past but after once or twice they were useless this is very efficient</li>
    <li> does not clip well - hard to handle</li>
    <li> Does not cut the toenail</li>
    <li> a serious tool, nothing flimsy about this clipper</li>
    <li> I love these toe clippers my nails are very thick and these clippers cut through them with ease and I don&#x27;t have to squeeze so hard for them to clip them very easy.</li>
    <li> Useless. This tool is advertised as being heavy duty but will not cut even average nails well. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I not sure if my toenails are tough to cut or what, but these things are just plane dull. I will send them back.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nicely made little tool but doesn&#x27;t cut big thick nails very easy. The design is impeccable along with the nice pointy tip but it needs to be bigger and sharper.</li>
    <li> After purchasing numerous clippers from big box stores with little results.I deceided to check the offerings on Amazon. I purchased the Equinox clipper and cannot tell you how pleased I am. The appliance is easy to grip and keep in your hand and easy to trigger. . For super hard or fungus ridden nails this is wonderful, and the price is fantastic. So happy again with my Amazon purchase!</li>
    <li> Excellent materials and product but a little too small for my large hands.</li>
    <li> Great quality!  Gets the job done the way any tool that is right for the job would work.</li>
    <li> Quality workmanship, definitely buy</li>
    <li> supposed to be surgical steel but not sharp enough to cut toenails</li>
    <li> Great buy. it gives you a precise cut every single time and it&#x27;s easy to carry you won&#x27;t regret buying it</li>
    <li> Clippers are great,  Work wonderfully on think toenails.  small , so easy to use with weak grip in hands. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough for use as toenail clipper</li>
</ol>
