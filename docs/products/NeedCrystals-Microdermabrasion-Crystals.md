<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> You know how exfoliating scrubs have too little grit?  Or have different sized pieces that only serve to scratch your skin?&lt;br /&gt;This is perfectly uniform and you can use as much or little as you need.  Mix with regular face cleansing cream and use as a mild face scrub.  Included is a small plastic spatula ( you may have to dig a little for it).&lt;br /&gt;I use it weekly .  My skin is brighter and brown spots have started to fade.  I anticipate that this should last over a year of weekly cleansings.</li>
    <li> Skin feels so soft &amp; refreshed after I use it. No breakouts, no fragrance. Gets rid of blackheads immediately! Pores look clean. It&#x27;s pure crystals so be careful not to use too much or it will burn. Love it!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin soft and warm like a quiet storm. Great product.</li>
    <li> Works super well. Make your own scrubs at home. Works great on face and body. Glad I bought.</li>
    <li> This is a serious exfoliator - the crystals are very fine.  If you mix a little bit of this product with a facial cleanser, you can cleanse your entire face.  It&#x27;s a little too soon to tell if it diminshes fine lines and wrinkles but I really like this product.  My skin feels very soft after each use.</li>
    <li> I used the crystals for the first time and can say I like the gritty feel of what feels like sand not oatmeal that is being used as the new exfoliating skin care. It removes the top layer of my skin and does not cause any irritation or prolonged redness. After using it one time, my skin is clear, soft and more alive looking from removing the dead skin on my face. I will keep using this as it is a great way to keep my skin healthy and more youthful looking.</li>
    <li> Seems to work just fine</li>
    <li> I bought it after reading very good reviews on amazon. I have a sensitive skin and these crystals are too harsh for my skin. My skin breakouts every-time I use it.  Not for sensitive skin types!</li>
    <li> Works really good your skin feels like baby skin after you use it . It is worth it to buy it is not big jar but it will lease for while . I use it one once a week together with Clarisonic .</li>
    <li> This is the best ever will totally buy it again</li>
    <li> Feels great, keeps my skin from breaking out! Love it</li>
    <li> The product is better than what I expected. It drastically reduced the size of my pores. After using it, my pores became way smaller, the redness reduced, the skin felt smother and clearer. I definitely recommend it to people who have large pores on their skin. But please be careful do not overuse it. Maybe once in two weeks would be enough as it is not good to use aluminium oxide.</li>
    <li> I use these every few days mixed with my cleanser. These crystals exfoliate my skin wonderfully and are gentle enough to not cause any issues. There is a lot of product in the container and a little scoop to help you get it out. Because I only use a very little amount, this will last me forever.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin but this has never made me break out or anything.  I like to add it to my face soap occasionally when I wash my face to exfoliate a bit.  I also really like adding it to my body wash.  This container is huge for one person and should last a very long time.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t abrasive enough,too fine</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product because I didn&#x27;t know that it had the element aluminum in it which I know is not to be absorbed into your body because of it&#x27;s harmful effect.  If I had known the contents, I would not have purchased it.  Sorry!!</li>
    <li> right away i noticed my skin soft i use it with my cleanser but not everyday because i noticed after the 2nd say i was peeling lol but i loive the prodcut its small but its alot and goes a long way</li>
    <li> I love these crystals. I add 2 or 3 little scoops with my ordinary facial wash whenever I felt the need to exfoliate- usually 2 or 3 times a week. These crystals do the job, and my face feels extra-clean and smooth. Using this now for over a month, it has really helped my skin to look more radiant, pores appear to be a tad smaller, and my skin tone is evening out.</li>
    <li> Mixed with Olay foaming facial cleanser, adjusted once, ending up with about 1:10 ratio, which is perfect for me at this time (age 64, sensitive skin, NW PA winter).  My skin feels smoother and softer after 5 days. Use with MIU soft facial brush, which I also recommend, once a day in evening, moisturize afterwards. Actually had a couple blackheads appear after first use, which makes me think I was not cleansing my face as effectively as I am now.  Very economical, love that I can mix to my own specifications. Definitely recommend and will buy again, although this will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> added this to my liquid soap....work great...</li>
    <li> After using this product my pores are alot smaller. I bought this 6 months ago and still have half a jar left. It give a little boost to store bought face soaps. However, after mixing it in with your body wash, facial cleaner, inc it will take a little work to evenly mix it.</li>
    <li> These are not to be overused.  Microdermabrasion Crystals are tiny, tiny pieces of glass.  I use these once a week on my spin brush with noxema.  You let the spin brush do the work so you don&#x27;t over pressure while using these.  The combination of the crystals and noxema leaves your face squeaky clean and minty fresh.</li>
    <li> Great addition to my beauty routine!  I simply add a small amount to my liquid cleanser and lightly rub in circular motions onto skin.  Great results when followed up with a good moisturizer .... for best results, use coconut oil after stepping out of shower.  I do not recommend using on face, however.</li>
    <li> I have older sensitive delicate skin. This is the perfect microdermabrasion product to add to my spa regimen. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really feel a difference after a wash! You just have to keep up with washing your face with the crystals!</li>
    <li> well I am trying to see if works! let see what happends!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days now.  My skin looks much more vibrant and a little of the powder goes a long way! I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a facial fanatic for many years. This product, made up from crystallized tiny granules, is like having a micro dermabrasion treatment at home. Love the feel on my skin, the neat application, the ingredients longevity; mostly, I adore the results! My skin is looking better than ever! I&#x27;m hooked for sure.</li>
    <li> I have been using a microdermabrasion product that was rather expense that I really liked.  After checking out the ingredients I discovered that it contained aluminium oxide crystals. I found NeedCrystals on Amazon and decided to give them a try.  I mix the crystals with my facial cleanser and get the same great results at a fraction of the cost.  When comparing it to the more expensive product it&#x27;s exactly the same....THE SAME BUT BETTER PRICE! I put the crystals in a container with a pour spout and just put some in my palm and a pump or 2 of my cleanser and wash my face every morning. Exfoliates and cleans out the pores. Love this stuff. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase from Need Crystals.</li>
    <li> ouch! go easy or you will scrub your face off!</li>
    <li> Great bang for your buck!! You only need a tiny bit to wash your face and this container holds alot, I can see it lasting me a year or more. Nice grit, not too harsh but does a great job exfoliating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with these, they have made my skin look clearer smoother and healthier, absolutely brilliant would definatly purchase these again</li>
    <li> My male friend actually suggested that I try this!  The crystals work great - they are really fine, so they really do polish your skin beautifully and you can tailor how many crystals to include in your face wash for the degree of roughness. I love the fact that you can add these to your favorite face wash. You can put the crystals in with every use, but you can also just put them in your face wash container and mix. Overall, a great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> I have used this product consistently for two (2) months and I am pleased to report that it has aided in smoothing my skin. I am of African descent and have been faced with rough skin patches an dark pores in the usual problem areas as elbows and thighs. However, please note that the product requires consistent use  followed by a good moisturizer to see improvement. In my cause I used raw shea butter to lock in moisture after my bathe. I have not seen any significant change in my larger dark marks, but if you have minor hyperpigmentation or rough patches, this is good.</li>
    <li> I like it but too sharp on my face.  I just have to use it once a week.</li>
    <li> Before paying 75$ for a popular brand of microdermabrasion scrub, I decided to take a chance on these crystals and make my own scrub.  To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect much because because #1, they were so cheap, and #2, the label design looks like it&#x27;s from the 70s. But, I decided to go for it and I&#x27;m glad I did. I love these crystals! They are like a very fine, white sand and I was surprised at how much comes in the container.  It comes with a tiny spatula for scooping a small amount of crystals. In a small travel-size container, I mixed a good amount of these crystals with my favorite face-wash and I LOVE how it feels when I scrub my face with it. It instantly smooths my skin. I&#x27;ve been using them for several months, and when I use them consistently, I notice a difference in the texture of my skin as well as how well my other skincare products work. The crystals slough off the top layer of dead skin cells so my skin is able to absorb more of the product. I&#x27;m excited to try some other recipes, such as adding a bit of argan oil or coconut oil.</li>
    <li> This is the second product of this kind that I have ordered from Amazon. I like them both however I feel that this one is a much better bargain. You get a lot for the money and it works great when mixed with a gentle cleanser.</li>
    <li> I use these crystals every 4 days. I apply via a facial cream designed for sensitive skin.  Specifically,  I mix the product with the cream, then use a flat foam pad and motorized face scrubber.  I apply in the shower using a mirror and do so until I feel my skin begin to get sore. I then rinse and wash.  Anyway, WOW!  This method literally &amp;#34;sands&amp;#34; away large pores and fine wrinkles.  My face in turn has become smooth in in a way that is analogous to using a buffing compound on a car&#x27;s clear coat.  I know that is a strange comparison, but it is very accurate. Anyway, I can&#x27;t believe how well micrderma-&amp;#34;ish&amp;#34;-abrasion works. Amazing. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I had stumbled on a home use Microdermabrasion machine and was interested in the effects and uses of this machine, but wow the prices for a quality machine is way up there.  I then saw this product and read the reviews and for the price and the effects I was sold. I used this tonight and wow, wow my face feels so soft and clean. These crystals are so very small and they also do not disovle, which is great. They are so tiny that you can feel the effects in those pores really well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use a half teaspoon, or so, of these crystals with a squirt of Cetaphil to wash my face every morning.  My skin is sun-damaged and I&#x27;m older, but it has made a difference.</li>
    <li> Happy with this.  Don&#x27;t bother w expensive nonsense exfoliators.  I use it with a little of my cleanser.  Between dermabrasions and when I feel I need it.</li>
    <li> PERFECT, MIX IT WITH SOME LIQUID SOAP TO USE....EASIER ON THE SKIN.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing. This stuff does what you think it does....... sands your skin&#x27;s surfaces making it smooth as... well almost a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Being honest, it is a bit uncomfortable when rubbing it onto my skin, you feel the sting.  I blend it well with a little face wash gel and give my face a full workout.  Rinse, apply a vitamin C enriched cream BEFORE I go to bed.  My face is very flush when I go to bed but when I wake up my face looks smooth and &amp;#34;not so haggard&amp;#34;.  love how my skin feels soft and younger.  I&#x27;m a guy and shouldn&#x27;t care but at 51yrs, I enjoy seeing my skin look a little&lt;br /&gt;less aged and it not costing a car payment.  This 8oz last a long long time.</li>
    <li> I have used this everyday since it arrived and my skin looks brighter and younger. I use a small amount along with a tea tree facial wash and the results are the same as when I get my monthly facials. It is a small container, but it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the price was good.  I love mixing it with a little facial cleanser and exfoliating.  Just be careful to not pour too much in your hands.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> will never use this up... Not sure how much it does but my face is flushed when done.. so maybe....</li>
    <li> Although you are capable of getting a &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; look after using this product, I prefer the larger crystals, similar to the &amp;#34;Buff&amp;#34; at Burke Williams.  I used these crystals in my facewash or even in a clay mask, scrubbed, let the clay mask sit then washed.  I was pleased with the overall results but I&#x27;m now searing for the larger crystals which give my face a smooth, glassy finish...</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seriously, using this and then a chemical peel is the SAME as spending a lot at a spa.  It really is - I know because I&#x27;ve done both and this product is great.  You don&#x27;t need much of it and so it will last for probably more than a year or 2 even.  Great to rub on hands; neck and chest - all places that show age.  I will surely buy this again from this merchant.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I use it weekly over my whole body with dead sea soap and it leaves me super soft.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I like putting a tiny bit of this in my palm with a squirt of whatever cleanser I am using and then shower off.  Gives skin a great polish and smoothing.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Fine Crystals Does Exactly What I Wanted!</li>
    <li> I have been using Philosophy&#x27;s two part microdermabrasion product for several years now but when I went to but it recently I thought the price had gotten just a little to high, so I started looking for a suitable replacement. I found these and thought for the price and all the good reviews I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. They are finer grained then Philosophy which I like. And I think this little jar will last quite a while. Happy.</li>
    <li> I dip my wet fingertips into the jar when washing my face and use in a circular motion with whatever soap or wash I&#x27;m using.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week. It always makes my skin look and feel very soft! I have oily skin at age 53</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this! Affordable and easy to use. After only two uses, my skin is glowing! It also makes my makeup go on more evenly because my skin is evened out. I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Not as abrasive as I would have liked, but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> These microdermabrasion crystals are perfect for any gel activator or just with a cream cleanser to add exfoliation. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who does there own facials and skincare at home.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Now everyone have a great day!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for christmas (she has very sensitive skin) and proceed to use it first day directions were kinda misleading didn&#x27;t really say how to apply and the company website doesn&#x27;t give any hints. after contacting a friends wife (certified Cosmetologist) we learned you just lightly moisten and tap it in the crystals and bam your on your way. should only be used once every other week tried it on myself 3 days in a row.... paid for it dearly face was red for a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how healthy aluminum is for cosmetics but i wash it off so whatever. I love this. i was a huge fan of mary kay microderm but cant afford that. This is a great replacement.&lt;br /&gt;It has the consistancy and sparkle that baking soda has. I first thought &amp;#34;then why did i pay for this if it&#x27;s just baking soda?&#x27;&#x27; However, it doesn&#x27;t disolve like baking soda. It stays gritty and carves off layers of skin.</li>
    <li> I add a very small amount to the microdermabrasion crystals with my facial cleanser, olay regenerist detoxifying pore scrub and my face never felt so clean and smooth. It&#x27;s a small jar that will last for a long time. I have very oily skin that is acne prone. I haven&#x27;t experienced a breakout since I&#x27;ve been using this product. I also use the pumpkin face mask spa treat aha 12% glycolic acid chemical peel every other day (I have very oily skin so I can get away with it. Do not do this if you have normal to dry skin. You may want to follow the directions to once or twice a week as instructed) It does wonders with my facial regime.  I finally found a facial regime that works for me!</li>
    <li> The product probably works well for skin problems; however I&#x27;ve been trying it to reduce age spots on my face and I&#x27;ve observed no change. I mix it with Porcelana, a &amp;#34;dark spot remover,&amp;#34; and even the combination hasn&#x27;t proven effective for 8 weeks. I&#x27;ll continue using it all, hoping it might still work. I&#x27;m an 85 year-old man trying to look good.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin but am not acne prone. I read the reviews and was excited to try this product but after weeks of use have yet to see a difference unfortunately.</li>
    <li> This works amazing. I had no idea it was going to be so professional. Will be buying more as gifts.</li>
    <li> Wow, my skin is so much smoother and softer now after having used this product. I mixed about a dime sized amount with my usual facial cleanser, and gently massaged my skin with circular strokes. Results are so pleasing after the first use, I can imagine how much improvement I will see after regular use.</li>
    <li> Not impressed ! Does not do much . I feel as if the crystals dissolve rapidly when using them to wash my face . I do not see a difference on my skin after use.  Waste of money !</li>
    <li> This generously-sized jar of fine grit exfoliating crystals lets me step up any face washing to a microdermabrasion session. After lathering up, I simply dip my damp fingers into the jar to transfer the granules to my face.  I&#x27;d been searching for a facial scrub with very small crystals that didn&#x27;t dissolve too quickly in water. I took a chance and ordered these, having no idea what I&#x27;d be getting. Thanks for the pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the product because it does result in a nice smooth polish to the skin. However, it&#x27;s a bit too fine-grained for my taste. I prefer to feel the scrub just a bit more while I am using it. Also, the crystals don&#x27;t rinse as cleanly as I would like with just water, I need to use a washcloth to get it all off. But not a big deal. My normal product is Kiehl&#x27;s microdermabrasion scrub, and I prefer how clean that rinses, but I don&#x27;t prefer paying 50 bucks, so this will do just fine!</li>
    <li> this product is great i have sensitive skin and i just use water with the crystals, i noticed that my moisturizer soaks right in</li>
    <li> MICRO IS RIGHT..WAY TO SMALL TO DO MUCH GOOD..</li>
    <li> Great value. Smooth skin! Add this to face wash or spin brush gentle exfoliation.</li>
    <li> Very small crystals, which is a GOOD THING.  Some reviewers seem to think this is a minus, but I do not.  Exfoliates gently enough, but thoroughly enough.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I had some acne scars on my right cheek, easy scars, nothing deep.  I been using this along with Noxzema Deep cleansing cream for 4 weeks,(you can use any other cream or neutral soap)  and I started seeing some improves, more smooth and you can barely see some marks, but I like to continue until better results.  The only problem I seen is that if i mix another strong cream on my face I got some rash, I bought from amazon Fair and White Bleaching Gel, and next morning I had redness on my cheeks, it took two days to disappear, but I learned not to use it on the same day.  Both products works very well, but please do not expect miracles, it takes time to get rid of acne marks.</li>
    <li> The crystals are very fine so they don&#x27;t scratch but they are very effective. It lasts a long time and can be used with the cleanser of your choice. For the price it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> It exfoliates the uppermost layer of the skin and leaves the skin soft.  Good product .  I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent... I used into my scrub and face wash. Work great for exfoliating.... Love it!</li>
    <li> Love it, I use only just a very small amount making my skin almost baby soft in only a week.</li>
    <li> I was so sad when my regular at home microdermabrasion kit from L&#x27;Oreal was discontinued a few years ago and have been searching for a new one that comes close to no avail.  I finally tracked down the ingredients for the one I loved and they are these same oxide crystals.  I decided to try it and love the price.  Works just like my former favorite for half the price.  I love that I can add more or less crystals to increase or decrease the amount of abrasion I want.  You should notice results after the first use.  I just mix with a plain, gentle cream cleanser.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> This works so much better than sugar or salt scrubs, which deteriorate as you exfoliate. I mix this with my cleanser, and its awesome!!!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:3953f8d21b1703ef528db998d0c9d508]] This is amazing! Like, this stuff really washes off all of the dirt and it really leaves your face feeling extremely soft. Even though it can really dry your skin out, it&#x27;s still a great product! Always moisturize!</li>
    <li> Love this! And it comes with a scope!!! My skin feels so smooth.</li>
    <li> These are great to add to your favorite facial cleanser. This is so much cheaper than other products, and with this, you can use your favorite face wash instead! It leaves your fave feeling and looking smooth.</li>
    <li> Huge portion of Crystals. Even if you use them everyday (with your facial cleanser), they will last foreeeeeever! Don&#x27;t know what it is about these silly little micro crystals, but they do wonders for your skin!! I blend a pinch full in with my Jan Marini Facial Cleanser I use twice a day and gently message this over my face (without rubbing the skin). This is a no brainer! Top of the line treatment for your skin, and is so cheap, it&#x27;s almost free! Forget drug store brands. Buy one great brand and blend it with the crystals. You and everybody around you will see a difference!!</li>
    <li> This product really helps to improve my aging skin by exfoliating so that products absorb better. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin,  so I can use it once a week or so.</li>
    <li> this is perfect for use with my own face wash</li>
    <li> I love it. I put a pinch in with my regular cleanser (drug store special), and I am amazed with the gritty, yet gentle texture. I will be using this regularly!</li>
    <li> Love it! Much more affordable than the other at home microderm products and leaves my skin super smooth. I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and this has been helping me stay clear. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this in my home made microdermabrasion cream and it&#x27;s the perfect grade for me :) Will always buy this one!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t fond of going to spas and paying such exuberant cost for microdermabrasion, so I did some research and found this product. I am a fan. I paired this product of natropathica and Epicurean products and I love it!</li>
    <li> Upon arrival, I find out that the top was not all the way on, so some of the product had spilled out of the jar. The product itself is kind of gritty, only used it once so far just to test it out, so can&#x27;t speak of how well it does as far as results goes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful it really does the job...but be very careful you don&#x27;t rub your skin off it could easily happen..i use it on dry skin mixed with olive oil and rinse off in shower and I have silky smooth skin..</li>
    <li> I use this product along with a facial scrub as suggested. The experience with the purchase was smooth. The product works...I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> its did as it says that&#x27;s my skin feeling very smooth and with that beautiful glow. I would refer it to someone else however I don&#x27;t believe its for everyday use</li>
    <li> Love this product. My skin feels amazing! It&#x27;s so much brighter and feels extremely smooth. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> works perfect on my skin, good price, totally recommend. my pores get smaller , skin becomes smother. i use it every other day, adding to face wash</li>
    <li> Awesome skin results! no peeling, skin was bright, colorful... no pain... easy to do... used it with regular body lotion...</li>
    <li> Love this product...I will buy it again.it made my face smoother.....awesome!!! I have been using it for 3 no and I could tell the difference</li>
    <li> Awesome, and a great price. Works wonders! Can be added easily to soap or cream. Use it for any part of the body with great results.</li>
    <li> These are very gentle on your face, but get the resurfacing job done. This is a spa quality product. I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> This leaves your face smooth and fresh.  I used to pay to get the expensive treatments and this has eliminated the need.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to remove dead skin cells at home.&lt;br /&gt;I found the product to do what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars instead of five because it dried my skin a little.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and this is a re-order.  It&#x27;s a better price than found in most beauty shops.</li>
    <li> IM  NO SURE HOW USE IT, AND IT IS CAME WITHOUT INTRUCCION ii&lt;br /&gt;IT IS STILL IN THE BRAN NEW</li>
    <li> Great this actually does remove all the old skin..after i rinse i feel my skin soft its awsome just dont over doit cuz you will end up with a scraty face but other than that its great</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that I keep on hand at all times. I use these crystals a couple of times a week to exfoliate my face, neck, arms, hands etc. I notice a big difference in my makeup application if I skip even one usage. I use the crystals straight-I do not dilute with cleanser. Product works much better than any other type of exfoliators you can buy at the store. The size is extraordinary for the price and will last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> this scrub works wonders on my fce removes blackheads and dead skin lke crazy  nice clean feel when washed off would buy again and again  great price too</li>
    <li> Very great at exfoliating the face. Am using crystals to diminish stretchmarks and i wish these were bigger or rougher. But they are perfect if you are just using them for exfoliation. So i will definitely keep this batch for my face but i will buy my other regular rougher brand i use for my stretchmarks problem areas that need something rougher.</li>
    <li> Ya know, I thought this product would be really good when I read about it.  Then when I got it here, and was reading the instructions, I decided to check the ingredients.  The first thing I saw was aluminum.  Everything that I have read tells me not to use deodorant, soaps, anything like that with aluminum in it.  It makes sense to me.  You don&#x27;t need a metallic property in your soaps, and facial scrubs.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect little microdermabrasion crystals.  The price can&#x27;t be beat for the amount  you get plus the free shipping.  I add them to my facial wash and body wash for the perfect amount of exfoliation.  I love being able to scrub as softly or as deeply as I&#x27;d like because I can control the amount I add.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I only use it once a week and mix it with my CeraVe Foaming face wash. Exfoliating too much can damage your skin and make it worse. I find once a week is perfect. I get dry skin on my forehead that makes my makeup look crappy. But using this once a week makes it so I never have that issue. I have a feeling this product is going to last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The grit is very fine. Compared to baking soda it was one step up. If you are looking for big grit this is not for you.</li>
    <li> Bought this about a week ago and I can say already I am experiencing softer, smoother skin with less acne. I mix this with my African black soap every morning when I was my face and I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I think that this is the best best bang for your buck for an exfoliator.  You can add the crystals to any sort of creamy face wash and it  creates an excellent exfoliator for your face or body.  The best part about this is that you can choose your favorite creamy face wash to add the crystals to and you can also choose how many crystals you add so you can determine how strong of an exfoliator you make.</li>
    <li> I love this. I&#x27;ve used it twice already. I aim to use it once every 5 days. This in conjunction with the real radiant vitamin c has done wonders for my acne proned blemished skin. I&#x27;m am so excited! I mix it with my cleanser and the results are oh so pleasing👍</li>
    <li> I am super excited about this product! It is the BEST!!! I add it to whatever cleanser I feel like using and it is amazing! I wish I would have found this sooner. I have told everyone I know about this. You can literally turn any cleanser into a super exfoliating cleanser. You can add as little or as much as you want. What I love so much is the fact that it is just pure crystals with nothing else added, so if you are like me and have blemish prone skin, you can add it to your anti acne cleanser and not have to worry about a break out. I have tried MANY microderm products and they all have pore clogging ingredients in them so I never had good results with them. How awesome is this product!? I can just add it to my favorite cleanser and VOILA! I definitely recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> No Idea about this product. I purchased it just to give it a try.it has a good reviews and 100% satisfaction or  money back Guarantee. For the price? it&#x27;s worth to try. I used it every other day with my facial wash cleanser and at first I had noticed that blackheads came out but it wasn&#x27;t bad. i think it was after 1 week that i didn&#x27;t see unwanted blackheads at all. I absolutely will continue using this as long as it won&#x27;t hurt my skin. And so far, I am happy and satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks and it definitely exfoliates really well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to use it daily because it does leave my skin feeling raw. I&#x27;d say finish off with a heavy moisturizer (or jojoba oil) to restore the oil balance to the face. Other than that it&#x27;s pretty great</li>
    <li> Love love this stuff!! The Crystal s are so fine and cannot damage skin.  Makes my skin look amazing when I use it. I will be be purchasing more. I would recommend this product to people of all skin types.</li>
    <li> I am not sure about this product yet. Will update when i am. Until then i am giving it a five star rating because it worked better on my friend&#x27;s face lol .</li>
    <li> Wow! I was NOT expecting this to be the most amazing exfoliating product I&#x27;ve ever used! I have dry skin with oily tzone and even after using expensive exfoliators I still have to scrub and scrub with toner to get a smooth surface without the scaly patches. This just came up as a suggested item when I got some hair stuff - the reviews were good, it was inexpensive, so I thought why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one use my skin looks and feels as smooth and silky as when I was a child.I even used a 10x mirror to check and every inch of my face is smooth and glowing even under such harsh magnification!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just dab on my usual cleanser with water and two finger tips into the crystals and start circular massaging into the skin for a few minutes- that&#x27;s ALL it takes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference I&#x27;ve been using Origins modern friction grommage exfoliator, which I&#x27;ve always thought was the best, but shockingly this crystal stuff worked BETTER, giving me a flawlessly smooth complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to give a big thanks to everyone who left an encouraging review that led me to try this - you guys have helped me so much!!!. This is my most important skin care product now and I will NEVER be without it!!!</li>
    <li> Works great and the price is good</li>
    <li> I really love this product, my main target is to get rid of the uneven skin tone . I&#x27;ve some dark spot in my face caused by sun, but after regular using of this product most of it are gone. The amount is really big and can use it for long time</li>
    <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and all of a sudden started breaking out really bad on my chin. I found a cleanser that got the breakouts under control but I still had some bumps and dark spots that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. This stuff did the trick! I use it once a week and it really smooth&#x27;s and evens out my skin. I just press a wet finger in the powder and use it with my facial cleanser. It works really good on rough elbows too.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, the thought of using professional strength microderm abrasion crystal may seem a little scary and dangerous. Well, I jumped in and did it anyways and its actually much more mild than you&#x27;d think :) they dont irritate my skin at all. Also, I suffer from milia (pesky non-acne white spots that are dead skin trapped under thr surface). These crystals, in conjunction with a moisturizing wash are doing the trick of clearing them up!</li>
    <li> For those of us who can&#x27;t really afford to get microdermabrasion treatments every month, I highly recommend using this product at home, for similar results! I just use my regular face wash, and add a touch of these crystals into it... It&#x27;s a superfine texture/grit, and you control the amount of pressure you use, with your fingertips.  It&#x27;s so inexpensive and lasts about a year, using it almost daily. I love this stuff. It makes my skin so fresh and polished, and preps my skin for moisturizer, and retinol absorption</li>
    <li> Not worth the buy. Another not worth your money</li>
    <li> Why haven&#x27;t I discovered this product before?! I mix mine with cleanser and have an amazing scrub, lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I used to get professional microdermabrasions for my skin and spent a ton of money. By getting this and adding it to my facial soap, I can get pretty nearly the same thing. I have noticed a positive change as well in my skin from use of this product. Overall, the quality and quantity of Crystals are great for at home facials. Careful of your eyes!</li>
    <li> I use this with just a little water, scrub like heck! Same results, if not better than at the spa/dermatologist. You&#x27;ll have to moisturize as your sanding off that top layer and need some moisture protection. I wouldn&#x27;t use this more that every 2 days, I personally only use it every 6-12 days as I&#x27;m scrubbing incredibly vigorously and my skin needs time to repair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! and i know that alumina (aluminum oxide) is the concern of the other party but its not really that harmful coz ure only exposed to a small amount and ure gonna wash it off ure face anyway soo .. I love this product.. my skin (i use this on my legs and face) feels so smooth.. and my acne scars fades and brightens. And by the way! It has a little spoon inside! I&#x27;m guessing not a lot of people know about this haha lol..</li>
    <li> Great. I love putting it in wish my normal face wash. I even add it to my proactiv when I want more exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I mix this with my favorite cleanser. Depending on the amount, you can adjust the level of exfoliation based on your skin condition of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Since I got this I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive scrub to try out anymore.&lt;br /&gt;You will see my review on bigger grit version for body as well. That&#x27;s much I love using this!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and these crystals work great but not so much to get hype over. They will leave you sneezing like crazy if you use too much because of the dust particles  but overall very nice product.</li>
    <li> Great product and 100% good quality super exfoliant&lt;br /&gt;I mix this powder with Neutrogena cream and make a soft&lt;br /&gt;exfoliant make my skin feel and look soft and fresh</li>
    <li> Not the miracle worker it is supposed to be, but it does clean the skin. You can get the same results with several other products, though.</li>
    <li> This is a great product when you can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t want to spend money on expensive microdermabrasion products. I just mix a tbsp in my cleanser and it cleans and exfoliates very well, just like an expensive product. I also use it in my body shower, its going to last forever since you use very little and the jar comes with a generous portion. I&#x27;m just so glad i&#x27;m a loyal amazon customer, i get to use products no one has ever even heard of.</li>
    <li> I love how this stuff makes my face soft after washing it off. It goes on great, and makes my skin feel pretty.</li>
    <li> Easy to add to any face wash and feels great. The crystals are not too abrasive so it is good for regular use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE !!!!! I&#x27;ve tried it in a couple people already and the difference is huge!!! Makes your skin super soft , the container is small but a little but goes a LONG way!!</li>
    <li> This grit of these crystals is so small. It is very pleasant and takes very little to get the job done. I would recommend this to anyone whose faces needs a good scrubbing.</li>
    <li> Incre&amp;iacute;ble and perfect for my face, great product</li>
    <li> I have oily skin pron to acne. I have used different kind of scrubs, but most of them are too soft and actually do not even remove dead skin. This product is wonderful, it is looks like baking soda. Small amount is enough while scrubbing and it does its job.IIf you have sensitive skin you have to do a test before scrubbing the whole face. Use with facial liquid soap and gentle circular motions. I use the product twice a week.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use with a dermabrasion kit where the replacement pads were somewhat pricey.  i would buy again.  think it&#x27;s helping my age spots and has definitely smoothed out my skin.</li>
    <li> I love these. My face feels so refreshed and clean after using these with my facewash</li>
    <li> Awesome deal - blend with soap or lotion - just be careful not to get it in your eyes</li>
    <li> I love this product. I can see a big difference in the appearance of my skin. I have a healthy glow and clearer skin.</li>
    <li> use a little with your facial soap and face cloth</li>
    <li> works great,is equal to or better than more expensive products</li>
    <li> I think this is the perfect size crystal to exfoliate the face. I exfoliate my face twice a week and this has really helped the condition of my skin. I mix this with my Cetaphil cleanser and it works very well! A jar will probably last me a few years. They give you a lot of crystals. Don&#x27;t forget that there is a small spoon in there if you need to scoop some out. I will definitely repurchase once I run out.</li>
    <li> I only do this once a week while I wait for another cream to remove hair.  I think more than once a week would make my face raw, but it works nicely when used seldomly.  I scoop a little into my already exfoliating face cleanser and realize the few crystals in the cleanser are kind of silly.  It is kind of like pure white sand.  The company could improve it by including a tiny plastic spoon since getting it out in small quantities is a problem.  This one container should last a very long time since so little is needed each use.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;d first like to say this product arrived extra fast and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get started. It&#x27;s night one and here&#x27;s my routine... I mixed the crystals in a small bottle with Cetaphil. Next, I toned with (DIY) ACV and green tea mix, rose petal witch hazel; then 1/2 pad of DR. DENESE advanced firming facial pads, SIBU sea buckthorn hydrating serum, INSTA NATURAL advance formula vitamin c serum, (a drop of) SIBU sea buckthorn oil and an essential oil mix (grape seed, carrot, lavender, pumpkin, pomegranate, and manuka)..... Like I said, here goes ;-) Right now, my face feels so so clean and tight... Cross your fingers for me to rid of a few blackheads and a few spots here and there. The acne scars have done well with healing and fading without the CRYSTALS so hopefully they&#x27;ll speed the process of evening out my skin tone.... I will update soon!</li>
    <li> I mix it every other day with my regular face wash, and it really scrubs off the dead skin. I love it.</li>
    <li> These crystals are perfect. I add them to facial cleansers or sprinkle them on a wash cloth for my hands and elbows. I put some in a salt shaker and keep it in the bathroom cabinet so it&#x27;s more convenient. I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say they have taken years off my hands and chest area. Plus I use them to exfoliate my skin before I use the derma roller. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is a tiny jar just so you all know. I though 8oz would be big for some reason. hahaha. Anyways, I barely have to use much of it. It&#x27;s great! You don&#x27;t need to use a lot. This is super fine like you would feel in high end products. They best part about this is you can add it to your face washes you already have.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. i can put a little into my cleanser and cleanse my face carefully and it&#x27;s just as buffed as a microdermabrasion at the salon, but soooo much less expensive. I was spending $50 to have the same thing done that i can do at home now. i am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great  product .I love it</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Used it several times already, great results.</li>
    <li> Worth the money...a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This will make your skin super soft! I use it every other day! love love love it</li>
    <li> I paid for this in full myself. I am so glad I got this. I am sure you are thinking what can you do with this. If you would like to make something homemade. With this you can add as much microdermabrasion crystals to your home made exfoliate. I am putting this in lotions to make a more moisturize. I am using this to make my own scrubs with soaps. I can put as much as I want in there or not much depends on how much exfoliating I need done to my body. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot when I use this. In the long run this will save me money by making my own and I can add essential oils if I want to it.</li>
    <li> I bought these crystals to add to my facial cleansing cream for the occasional &amp;#34;buffing.&amp;#34; They really work as an additive for microdermabrasion cleansing and smoothing! The crystals are extremely fine in texture and the jar contains more than enough crystals to last many months, even with regular use. A tiny dab is all that is needed. I will also use this with my cleansing brush for a little extra exfoliation - although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this more than one a week. I use this product 3 times a week and can always see a difference in texture, tone, and smoothness on my face. Also works on the body!</li>
    <li> Took a chance on this after reading the other reviews and I am so glad I did. I have very dry skin year round even after taking vitamins regularly, using moisturizers, coconut or other essential oils, drinking extra water, etc. I had a Susan Lucci Microdermabrasion system years ago that helped, but couldn&#x27;t afford to replace it when it quit. I found this product while searching for another kit and thought it was worth the risk to see if it would do the job for a cheaper price. Have used it for approximately 6 weeks twice a week. I just mix a very tiny amount of the crystals in my hand with coconut oil. (The crystals go a long way, and I anticipate this jar will last me at least a year based on my current usage) All I do is massage the very tiny amount of crystals mixed with the coconut oil on my face while in the shower and leave it on for several minutes before rinsing off. It takes several splashes of water to rinse off well, but the crystals are doing an amazing job exfoliating my dry skin. It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of all of it due to my excessively dry condition, but it does just as well as the expensive microdermabrasion kit did, and dozens of other expensive products on the market. Love this stuff, and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product with the hopes it would be exactly what I was looking for and it is!! I mixed approximately 1/2 teaspoon to 1 cup of my cream cleanser. Unbelievable! These crystals are the same as the ones used for microdermabrasion in the doctor&#x27;s office. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This was a wasted purchase for me, as the crystals were not nearly gritty enough to be satisfactory. I&#x27;ve bought sugar scrubs elsewhere that were more effective. At the time of purchase, however, this was the highest grit level product, and so I went with that. I have only used it once and haven&#x27;t returned to it.</li>
    <li> Really like this product! I use it with my regular face wash and I can feel and see a difference it makes.</li>
    <li> I am OBSESSED!!!! I had a sample of Dr. Brandt Microdermabrasion skin exfoliant and I loooved it. However when I looked online to buy a full sized bottle, it retailed for $80! So luckily ol&#x27; faithful Amazon had just what I was looking for. I bought this and mixed it with some Cetaphil face wash and it is EXACTLY the same as Dr. Brandt&#x27;s, except for no fragrance. I did probably 75% cetaphil and 25% crystals and works well for me.</li>
    <li> Super product. I mix it with my facial cleanser and use about twice a week. I also mix it with my shower gel and use all over twice a week and every shower on my knees. I&#x27;m 62---so I need it that often! Makes my skin feel soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love how I can just throw this into any face wash or body wash to exfoliate my skin. Don&#x27;t scrub too hard!</li>
    <li> There is no information how to use it and how often. And also aluminium? For my skin it doesn&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
    <li> handy stuff to use at home (no machine) - I just add it to my facial wash once or twice a week (Keep your mouth closed when you rinse!).  Will be adding some to some soap to try that out soon too.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> works great, like that its chemical free and should last me a long time! I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Great product for my oil skin. Really helps exfoliate. Great price. I use along with my Purity facial wash. I only use 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> This works very well mixed in with some of your normal cleanser. A little bit goes a long way so this will probably last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all, the crystals are too fine.</li>
    <li> I mix with Cetaphil gentle cleanser.  Use on face, d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;, etc.  It&#x27;s one of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> Love these crystals. I use a small amount mixed with my regular face wash and my Gurin face brush. They are not too course. You can feel them scrubbing away all the dead skin. This bottle will last me a very long time. I use about a teaspoon twice a week.</li>
    <li> I just used twice however this product is a keeper ..my skin feels smoth and my pores look smaller .. i have acne marks on my skin ..waiting to see the results over time ..</li>
    <li> I have been use microdermabration for years and I love this product</li>
    <li> I like it but I wish it was already in a cream that you can just apply with an applicator.  My face was smoother and looked brighter.</li>
    <li> Whenever I need a little exfoliation, I can just add this to any face wash for glowing skin.  I have also added it to a drop of lotion for a moisturizing cleanse.</li>
    <li> This is a finer grit than what is found in Olay&#x27;s dermal abrasion but it&#x27;s good to use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I love it!! I got it on time and it was as described. Is very helpful for exfoliating, but be careful when massage because if you do to hard you&#x27;ll irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it exfoliates my skin. It feels like a baby again and doesn&#x27;t hurt. I mixed mine with some good oils, so it exfoliates and moisturizes. The only problem with that is, it&#x27;s hard to remove the crystals.</li>
    <li> I noticed this product improved my skin texture just a little bit but unfortunately overall this product did not help me personally and irritates my skin after using it leaving tiny bumbs behind.  I gave it a rest for a few days and tried again and the tiny bumps came back again after using so i know it was this product causing irritation.  This product also contains aluminum which is not good for the skin so could have been the reason why.  I used it as directed and very gently.  What may work for one person may not work for someone else.  We all have different skin. They have great customer service.  Thank you for the product.</li>
    <li> Used it just got it smooth skin like this used with normal and cloth.</li>
    <li> This combines wonderfully with Olay Total Effects Revitalizing Foaming Cleanser and the Skin Cleansing System Facial Brush &amp; Body Care Kit for Women &amp; Men. Includes 4 different heads - Large Body Brush, Soft Face Brush, Regular Face Brush and Pumice Stone. Water-Resistant products found also on amazon.com.  Will purchase again; I think, though, this will last a long time!</li>
    <li> These are very fine grain crystals you can add to your regular cleanser.  I love that I can use it daily, or just a few times a week.  I also think it will last a very long time, as I only add very little to a dime sized amount of cleanser and can feel it.  I currently add it to an oil based cleanser and follow up with a lightweight lotion.  I used to love a St. lves daily microdermabrasion that got discontinued and so this was a very pleasant surprise.  I am unsure if it would irritate skin without being combined with a moisturizing cleanser and followed up with lotion but I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, you feel the difference in one use.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my skin look refreshed and new. I use it daily with a gel cleanser to gently exfoliate my skin.</li>
    <li> Yea. Just thought it was junk. Received it in no time at all. But the product its;f sticks to your face so badly that you&#x27;re literally trying to scrape it off of your face. I use an electronic facial brush and it&#x27; still hard to get off. I go in for microdermabrasions , this is not the same. Still have the rest of it on my shelf. Guess I should throw it away.</li>
    <li> these work great and really buff the dead skin off</li>
    <li> I have oily to combination skin with acne. I bought this based off of reviews and I would say I didn&#x27;t see a major difference with my skin, which was disappointing. I didn&#x27;t realize that the crystals would be much smaller. I prefer grains that are slightly rough and as big as sugar at least. I would recommend for those who are considering purchasing this that if you own a facial wash that you&#x27;d like to transform into an exfoliator then just add the microdermabrasion crystals into your facial wash. Add as much as you&#x27;d like, it may vary by the quantity of your facial wash and your own personal preference of how you&#x27;d like an exfoliator to feel on your skin. Keep in mind that with how small these crystals are then it&#x27;s very gentle so it may work great on those who have sensitive skin and those who may not like typical exfoliators that are a bit rough on the skin because the grains are bigger.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I use it with my battery powered facial brush for a total deep clean and buffing that leaves my face feeling smoother than anything I&#x27;ve previously found.  I have also taken the advice of adding the crystals to my regular cleanser to create a nice gentle exfoliator for the times that I don&#x27;t use the brush.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good at home solution.  As with anything you put on your face, be intelligent about the amount you use and how often.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using with every wash.  I don&#x27;t think using any exfoliator twice a day every day is a good idea, but it depends on your skin and needs.</li>
    <li> If you were paying $35-40 for Vasanti or Dr Brand microdermabrasion exfoliants, listen up... Buy this instead and invest $$ you&#x27;ve saved into something more meaningful... As someone here suggested, transfer some crystals into a salt or pepper shaker, keep by the sink and sprinkle into your favorite face wash, cold cream, aloe vera gel or even into exfoliating papaya enzyme mask for double the benefits and massage in for 3-5 and rinse off. Great product.</li>
    <li> These work really good and they seem like they are going to last a long time. They aren&#x27;t as abrasIve as I hoped for. I have some acne scars/pits id like to smooth out. I can definitely feel that my face is smoother after using this. I just think it will take more time to fix the trouble spots.  I use it will my Clarisonic. I will buy again if these ever run out</li>
    <li> Too harsh for my skin, I tried several times and the following day I had tiny rash like pimples.</li>
    <li> I am done purchasing expensive exfoliation products.  This works just as well&#x27; if not better than the so called premium brand products.  I just add a small amount to my face wash and rub in circles for a minute.  The crystals are very fine and similar to a very expensive Philosophy exfoliation product that sells for much more. I will continue to purchase this product but this jar will last for quite some time since so little is needed.  Great deal and a great product!</li>
    <li> I use it several times a week and it has improved my skin.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Does anyone remember Neutrogena&#x27;s first microdermabrasion kit that came with that massager thing and the crystals?  They have since replaced it with some kind of weird exfoliant pad, but the jar of gritty crystals was my favorite thing - I didn&#x27;t even bother with the massager, I just used my fingers.  (Ok, that sentence sounded bad. LOL)  The only problem was it was expensive to buy refills.  It&#x27;s been years since that product went off the market and I never found a good replacement until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sell this stuff in an even larger quantity, which is technically a bigger deal, but this jar will probably last years if you are just using it weekly.  The only issue is that it&#x27;s hard to mix it in with your face soap or oil or whatever you are using without risking getting soap/oil in the crystals jar.  You truly don&#x27;t need a lot of crystals, but you want to get the ratio right, which means you may want to add more halfway thru when your hands are wet.  I usually pour a little bit out on to a post-it or a tiny finger bowl so I don&#x27;t have to worry about contaminating the whole jar with soap/oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can mix this with your favorite soap, or add it to jojoba or grapeseed or vitamin e oil, or even honey and scrub away.  I recommend doing it in the shower or right before because it can be hard to rinse all the crystals away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I get older (I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s), my skin gets dry in the winter, and this stuff really helps get rid of those tiny bits of flaky skin.  It also helps smooth out slight wrinkles, which I am just starting to get and feel a bit self-conscious about.  For the price, it&#x27;s really a no-brainer, and you have the flexibility of adding whatever product you want with it to customize your skin care regime.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. I used to purchase microdermabrasion treatments and I feel this is just as effective. It&#x27;s so affordable I figured I would give it a try. I love how I can just add it to my hydrating moisturizer and get exfoliated.</li>
    <li> I think they work well. My skin looks great. There is some discussion in articles about toxicity, which concerns me. Any scientific based  evidence to the contrary would be great.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I haven&#x27;t seen the results that a lot of the other reviewers made. I&#x27;ve been using it once a day for about a month now.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this item again.</li>
    <li> I mix 1-2 scoops of this with Neutrogena eye makeup remover lotion (which you can use on your face too) or my other cleansing cream in the palm of my hand to wash my face. The crystals are very fine and you don&#x27;t have to work hard and it doesn&#x27;t seem to tear up my skin like those chunky scrubs that don&#x27;t seem to be really able to clean the as well. It seems to really help keep my large pores cleaner than before if I use it 1-2 times a week. Also, this jar will probably last all year if not longer so I recommend keeping it clean and dry (don&#x27;t drip water in it from your hands).</li>
    <li> Awesome! This is exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks Amazon!  You can use it for the whole body.</li>
    <li> Love it, buy it. It makes my skin smooth and reduces acne scars and gives you a mini face lift looking young and healthy.</li>
    <li> So gentle and soft on your face. Used it for the first time cant wait to see the improvement:) Im excited</li>
    <li> These crystals are fine enough to do a superb job and not irritate the face. The jar is just right size to place the brush into and not make a mess.</li>
    <li> I wanted something like this that I could mix with whatever product I chose. I mix it with Jojoba oil and love the way it makes my skin feel. It will last a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much at all. Other products that have these crystals are way too expensive.</li>
    <li> i am a 40 something but look early thirties mother, wife, and hard-working nurse who would like to stop aging!!! I  used to get professional dermabrasion as part of my regimen but NOT ANYMORE. these are just as good (maybe even  BETTER  since YOU control the pressure) and cost pennies per treatment. bought these over 6 months ago, use for face and occasionally whole body and still have crystals to last a few more months. OK so do yourself a favor, stop wasting time and money driving to and paying for professional treatments and START doing it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO this: I mix up a recipe of yogurt with lemon juice OR crushed strawberries (design your own) and add enough crystals to make a nice scrub. Shower or wash face as usual, then follow up with diy dermabrasion by gently scrubbing desired areas in circular motions. i&#x27;m used to it so i go pretty hard on feet legs buttocks and tummy and gently but thoroughly on face.DO Rinse but DON&#x27;T wash off the yogurt residue off. something about it soothes and tones. this is one of the many  things i do to keep age at bay. makes dark patches light, pores small n clear, virtually no acne, soft allover, husband always caresses</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect for deep cleaning blackheads and pores and removing dead skin. The bottle is HEAVY, and a little goes a long way. Plus, you really only need to use it every few days! Good stuff and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> For the low price you get enough of this product to probably never have to re-order it again. I like to use it after I have steamed-up my face and applied an enzyme mask to it. It can also be used in combination with a (very, very) mild daily cleanser, otherwise it can strip your face of all its moisture. As these are silica crystals, they tend to dehydrate your skin, hence it is very important to moisturize afterwards and use it consciously, not more than twice a week. Otherwise, this product does exactly what it says it will do; remove dead skin-cells and rejuvenate the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy to give this product 5 stars because it does what it says it will do. I love the feel of it on my face, and I love my face after I use it. In the morning I sprinkle some on top of my Ceravae moisturizing cleanser and scrub away. After rinsing well I slather on Ceravae moisturizing cream. Then, at night, I use the Crystals again with cleanser, rinse and put on a light coat of Planet Earth Whole Dead Sea Mud Mask with Bentonite clay. I feel it tightening up my skin as it dries.....unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever experienced.....Then I put on a light coat (don&#x27;t need much) of Bel Essence Intensive Anti-aging  treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At dinner tonight my friend asked what I&#x27;d been up to, as my face looks years younger....only been doing this regimen for a week or so, but it, along with a sugar detox (The Sugar Defeat: Alpert &amp; Farris) I am feeling and looking better than ever!</li>
    <li> My new secret to great looking skin without a huge investment!</li>
    <li> This stuff will last me forever and makes my face shiny and glow after a cleansing with my sonic brush.</li>
    <li> Works better than some spas. My skin look much better and not expensive like spas or docs offices.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected</li>
    <li> I sprinkled the crystals on the Pro-x brush moistened with organic lite sesame oil ......after a couple of minutes of facial exfoliation ,I could see the result : glowing face ....and dirty brush !</li>
    <li> Awesome product but don&#x27;t scuba too hard!  The first time I used this I scrubbed too hard and ended up with minor burns similar to wind burn on my face!  Once you get the hang of it however it works wonders!</li>
    <li> Loved this product. Perfect exfoliator. As another poster suggested I poured some in a salt shaker which allows for easy application and use. A little goes a long way. I mix it with my daily facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> Received package opened and product beat up waiting for a new one. Will update actually product review when I get a sealed package with a new looking product.</li>
    <li> Product as described but I would prefer slightly larger size crystals....these are so tiny that they require quite a bit of scrubbing to remove dead skin.</li>
    <li> This reminds me *exactly* of the texture of crystals used in spas. And it should, since they&#x27;re made of the exact same thing. I add some of these to my cleanser about once per week and scrub - works beautifully.</li>
    <li> I have a difficult skin to take care of (very sensitive, prone to acne, half greasy half dry... :| )&lt;br /&gt;And these crystals clean my skin, tightens pores and smoothes imperfections. It makes my skin look healthier and more fresh.&lt;br /&gt;i love this product !!</li>
    <li> This was an add-on to the skin care system and it does a good job of removing the dead skin around the face and neck.  The crystals are a little hard to wash off after using but not a major issue.  Suggest that you dip the skin care system into the crystals when off and wait until you have it pressed against your face before turning on. Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> I use this about 2 times a week with my daily face wash....Over the last year I have had major acne issues, so I have been using this to get rid of build up of dead acne skin left behind (gross I know) but I my face feels awesome when I&#x27;m done</li>
    <li> I thought I might have roseacea because of the large pink splotches on my face, but after using this for a month, my skin looks good even without makeup. I took someone else&#x27;s tip and put it in a salt shaker and I put a little in my hand and then add my face wash  and it&#x27;s so easy! I have also noticed my pores are looking smaller. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  I tried the crystals in a cream cleanser as the directions stated.  I broke out because of the crystals.  Not my favorite product.  I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> great grit level! Works  well added to any face wash...a good clean feeling!</li>
    <li> Works great with Clarisonic machine and even a lesser expensive brand.  My Clarisonic machine crapped out after about 2 years so I bought a lesser expense machine.  But it just isn&#x27;t the same.  So I bought another brand and will use these crystals with that new unit.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> This product is so reasonably prices and you get a lot of crystals.  I mix them into my cleanser to exfoliate my skin.  You only need a little bit, so this size jar will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I really love these crystals! I use them once a week and to exfoliate after a peel. They are very fine and don&#x27;t feel abrasive on the skin at all but they definitely do the job. You massage them into your skin for about 3-5 minutes and then rinse really well. Afterwards, your skin feels really smooth and buttery. I use it on my lips to and they look really pink and plumped after. Also, you only need to use very little of the product, so this container will last forever. Overall, definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love to use these to exfoliate every now and then with my own cleansers.</li>
    <li> This product definitely requires a lighter hand when applying.  I don&#x27;t use it often.  I prefer a regular exfoliant instead.</li>
    <li> What more can I say? These are cheap, easy to use, and extremely effective when used properly. I recommend taking the time to do a little research before doing any microdermabrasion at home, especially if you have sensitive skin or any kind of skin condition.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Love Love it. i mix it w my cereve cleanser. just a lil goes a long long way. will purchase again. Part of my skin care routine i do this microdermabraision one to twice a week. Fast Shipping. Great price. Excellent Product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I just love these crystals.  I use it at night, and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.  I use it about twice a week.  I also use it on my neck and it is very soft too.</li>
    <li> I use it with any other cleanser and it does a great job. My face feels softer and cleaner! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I started looking for a good scrub for my acne prone skin.  I have been using sulfur based treatments, which dries out your skin and makes it flaky, so I needed something with some grit.  I combine these crystals with Neutrogena Acne Stress Relief Scrub and get smooth, flake-free skin.  Looks like the tub will last me a while too.  I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> Mix it with your favorite cleanser.  Very fine granules, so you wont feel like you&#x27;re scraping sharp pellets over your face like with other scrubs.  I use this mixed in (about half and half) with cetaphil.  I have issues with acne and cell turnover and this works great for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! My face feels very soft after I use this! I don&#x27;t use it all the time, maybe once a week or even once a month, and that&#x27;s sufficient. This gives you a lotttt of crystals so it&#x27;ll last a very long time, which I like as well!</li>
    <li> These crystals are perfect for thoroughly exfoliating your face without damaging your skin.  I have experienced a noticeable improvement in my complexion since using this.  The dullness has disappeared, my skin is fresher, looks moister and I have had a lot fewer incidents with those dreaded clogged pores resulting in pimples.  It has really helped clear up my adult acne.  I just add a little to my face wash a couple times a week.  I also use it on my body to get rid of dead skin and it has done an amazing job for my legs, especially my upper thighs and backside that always seems to have those little bumps and in-grown hairs. This product has been so useful and worked so well that I went back and ordered the larger size.  I am very pleased and feel that for once, my money was well spent on a product for my face/body.</li>
    <li> I love these crystals.  I no longer have to buy the expensive products for exfoliation.  I expect this will last me for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Works great but very difficult to get i off your face.  I recommend mixing it with water instead of oils, don&#x27;t use it in the shower (tends to get STUCK &amp;#34; in other places&amp;#34;) and use a wash cloth for removal</li>
    <li> Excellent results, use it with the almond oil for my face and have noticed a remarable improvement in the softness of how my face feels.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I mix half a teaspoon or less with a creamy fruit oil cleanser.  A little goes a long way.  Love how affordable this is, and it&#x27;s better for your face than using the average apricot scrub made with walnut shells.  This jar will last for quite some time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference. Only thing I see is my face is little brighter right after washing with it with my daily face wash.  But after that nothing.  I really don&#x27;t know how this product go such a high review? I am on to looking for something else.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF.  Throw away all of those goopy scrubs that don&#x27;t do much.  Use this on a damp washcloth by itself, or with a dab of your favorite cleanser.  This jar will easily last me years... using it a few times a week.  It feels great and makes my skin glow.</li>
    <li> These crystals when mixed with my favorite face wash give me microdermabrasion results. I cant believe it!!! You control the amount of crystals to fine or scrub. I am in love. If I want just a fine scrub I use the handy spoon it comes with and do a fine scrub. If I want the microderm effect I add more. Easy to do at home. I am a new mommy and my face is glowing. I am so pleased with this product. The price of microderm in a spa is about 50 dollars and up. Well now I can do it at home for 12 dollars or less for alot of crystals. This will last for a while. I am using this 4 days a week. Thank u Need Crystals. I am a dedicated customer now. I took a chance on this product and I am so glad I did. Be careful with the amount of crystals u use. The first night I scrubbed too hard and learned quickly how well these worked. I had minor abrasions around my eyes....which has happened with me with microderm from the spa.I under estimated the strength of these potent crystals.Happy scrubbing!! Get glowing. Also I should mention I have terrible acne. I thought my face was gonna  break out big time due to hormone changes. This has helped alot!!!  Not even those pesky blackheads in my nose.</li>
    <li> You do not need to spend big dollars on a microdermabrasion product! You can use alone with water or on a facial buffing puff or add it your existing facial cream.  It&#x27;s all a matter of modifying how much and in what manner you can deliver the microdermabrasion.  I happen to have skin that was tanned at one time and therefor I have &amp;#34;tougher&amp;#34; skin; hence, I use the product with just water and a washcloth or facial scrubber.  Its fine mill is perfect for all skin types.</li>
    <li> This product is not only affordable, it&#x27;s incredibly effective! This is the best beauty purchase I made this spring. When used as a scrub, the crystals instantly shed your dry winter skin. Within 1-2 uses, your legs, arms and face are soft and ready for a cute sundress! I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants their skin to glow without having to pay for the cost of multiple spa treatments!</li>
    <li> I bought these to use as an exfoliant as I had read in many other reviews. But the super fine crystals get stuck to my face and don&#x27;t want to let go. It took quite a bit of scrubbing with a washcloth to rid my skin of the crystals.</li>
    <li> These crystals are made from aluminum and are very toxic. I did not realize it until after my purchase.  Professionals using this on clients wear masks so they don&#x27;t breathe it in. It looks very harmless but it&#x27;s not.  Stay away. I use raw honey to exfoliant instead. Works much better.</li>
    <li> junk  and  i  was  not  satisfied,  dont  lose  your  savings</li>
    <li> thank you,,,i received this merchandised last week,just don&#x27;t have time to post my review my like it..</li>
    <li> Brightened my dull skin!</li>
    <li> my face feel good, and my acne look better!</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. I add the microdermabrasion crystals to my face cleanser and then I use the BriteLeafs Cleansing System to clean my face. It works great and I like it because you can add the crystals to any cleanser. It is more economical than having to buy a microdermabrasion cleanser and you can use your favorite cleanser. The crystals were not harsh on my face and I experienced no redness after each treatment.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Only used once so far (haven&#x27;t had it a full week yet), I like it. I mixed it on a 1 to 10 ratio as directed. After I have used it a few weeks I will post a follow up.</li>
    <li> When I first got it, I was like, &amp;#34;How do people think this is such a giant container?  It&#x27;s small!&amp;#34;  Then I realized: there are a lot of crystals in there.  Seriously, I do not foresee ever running out.  And the crystals are small and really feel like they&#x27;re doing something without abraising your skin right off.  If I ever DO run out, I&#x27;ll be sure to get these again!</li>
    <li> Good deal. As described.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Very fine crystals can be used for face or the entire body, mix with anything you want: oils, creams, masks, powders, soaps. My skin feels smoother after one day. The jar comes with a small spatula but using it with wet hands while taking a shower is rather inconvenient. Maybe a small dispenser would be a solution.</li>
    <li> Awesome! U can add these to anything!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this about a month now, religiously, 2x/day. It&#x27;s definitely smoothed out and cleared up a lot of my acne, but it hasn&#x27;t completely cleared. I would say about 60%. After another month I think it will be clear. It has definitely refined my pores; breakouts are much smaller and don&#x27;t hurt. My jawline has cleared up completely.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve yet to use. It acts like a facial scrub but much gentler. Best used with an inexpensive cream cleanser that you would buy at any CVS pharmacy with a coupon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I bought it as a replacement for the small overpriced Oil of Olay microdermabrasion scrub I had been purchasing previously. This product is a great value and very effective. I like how easily this mixes with my face wash and am excited to mix it with a cream or lotion to see how I like that! I do wish the granules were not as fine, but I that was lack of research on particle size on my part, not a problem of the product.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on this skin and a little goes a long way. Great mixed with a cleanser.</li>
    <li> love these. Face feels tight &amp; clean after use.</li>
    <li> Mix it with face wash and get a facial result, I love this product.  No need to purchase pricey microdermabrasion from fancy brands anymore</li>
    <li> Great product does a nice gentle job.</li>
    <li> Just a little mixed with your face cleanser, exfoliates perfectly.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING.  I have skin so nasty that my makeup makes it look worse. It highlights all the dead skin and looks so cakey... But when I washed myself with this... All dead skin is now gone.  My nose was so clear that I freaked out.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> It makes my face feel fresh and clean</li>
    <li> I mixed the crystal with my face wash and it made my face softer and smoother. Used it in the shower and had the same great results, soft skin and soft elbows and knees. My skin looks more softer and supple. I do follow up with Cetaphil moisturizer. Great product :-)</li>
    <li> I LOVE that I can add as much Microdermabrasion Crystals to my cleansing cream as I would like!  I had a little bit of soreness from sunburn, so I added less…if I miss using this for a few days, I can add more.  It is 120 grain crystals, so they are rather small, but they work wonderfully well!  I am so happy I found these.  I have tried so many cleansing creams with crystals already in them, and they never seem to have enough crystals in them.  This makes my skin shiny, clean and smooth!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> They are ok, much finer grind than other brand I have used.</li>
    <li> I can really tell the difference when I am done using it on my face. My skin is super smooth. It works just as good as my microdermabrasion machine.  Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Makes any cleanser an exfoliator</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, feels like your really getting a good clean.  But it is difficult to get off so must rinse for a while or when you put on moisturizer you will still feel little grains on your face.</li>
    <li> These Crystals are like magic... my face looks so nice...please do yourself a favor and just buy it..</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product. I think people should just buy this and have at home facials instead of paying a ton of money to go to spas, though it is nice to be pampered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this a couple times a month on my face and hands. I use a small amount and mix it in with my regular facial soap (as other reviews have mentioned). My skin is sensitive and it&#x27;s not harsh for me at all. I do notice slight tenderness afterwards, but it&#x27;s to be expected. You can experiment by pressing harder on the skin while using this product or being very gentle on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do is use it before bed. I use hot water to wash my face, but not super hot where it&#x27;s bad for my skin. This opens up the pores and makes skin more supple. It also helps any cleanser you use clean your face better as it can get into the pores and also helps any lotion or toner absorb into the warm skin much easier. Then I use the Microdermabrasion Crystals with my facial cleanser making sure I wash it all off properly. The tiny crystals can be missed if you just splash it off with water, so be thorough. Afterwards, I use a nice toner and lotion.</li>
    <li> This product really works.. add it to you cleaner..</li>
    <li> Love the product. Very fine crystals and works well.</li>
    <li> My favorite scrub ever was St. Ives Daily Microdermabrasion. Of course they had to discontinue it. I&#x27;ve spent years looking for a scrub that has the same finely ground crystals, but nothing came close until I found this. This mixed in with a regular plain gel or cream cleanser gives me the most amazing, fine, gentle but effective srub. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So far I have used this product once on my face and it removed many pimples that had formed from a soap that irritated my face.  My face felt smooth immediately after and it time to use it again a week later.  I have also used it in a homemade sugar scrub and it made a BIG difference on my dry, scaly legs which I&#x27;ve had for years. Nothing I tried on my legs worked from Japanese body cloths to Pretty Hands and Feet - all I could do was cover it up with a skin cream. The sugar scrub that I made mixed with some crystals removed most of the scales and so far I&#x27;m impressed. I&#x27;m off to give it a second go.</li>
    <li> effective low cost solution you can use with any cleanser instead of risking a reaction from changing cleanser suddenly. however, be aware this is  HUGE tub that would take forever to finish. split it with a few friends.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel smooth. I have sensitive skin and it don&#x27;t bother it at all. I don&#x27;t see a big big difference but it does make my face feel cleaner and my makeup look better</li>
    <li> I mix this with my facial cleanser and can feel it working. My face feels softer and looks better after using this.</li>
    <li> Was shocked how much a small bottle holds, becasue you only need a little it will last a long time for your face.  Be careful not to scrub too hard and mix it with a cleanser, so it&#x27;s not too harsh.</li>
