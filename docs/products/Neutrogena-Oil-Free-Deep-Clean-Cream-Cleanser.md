      <li>I had a lot of acne with fair, oily skin, so I would always stray towards specifically &#x27;acne fighting&#x27; cleansers.</li>

      <li>Let me tell you that this stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>I decided to try to cream cleanser based on its superior reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did:</li>
      <li>This cleanser is affordable and is a nice &amp;#34;wake</li>

      <li>Excellent for sensitive and oily skin.</li>
      <li>This face wash leaves a fresh, almost minty feeling and works great at getting off the days dirt.</li>
      <li>Most people looking for Neutrogena already know what it is.</li>
      <li>Meaning, has a more alkalized ph balance rather than a acidic, which dries my face.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>OK-</li>
      <li>with moisturizer always and sunscreen for the day on top of moisturizer</li>
      <li>I also wanted a cream cleanser because after I turned 40 skin dryness in my face became more of an issue even though I make sure to drink plenty of water.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m ordering more of this today.</li>
      <li>I  absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>Most of the complaints here are about how this cleanser doesn&#x27;t get rid of their makeup.</li>
      <li>I can;t rave enough about it, best cleanser for the price!</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Wish they continued to sell this in the store, but I guess that&#x27;s what Amazon is for :-)</li>
      <li>Its so refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Could have done with some more granules in it.</li>
      <li>I bought this product and its fantastic!</li>
      <li>In comparing the two products, the Biore does a much better job cleansing your skin.  </li>
      <li>I love the creamy feel of this face cleaner on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>When I did, it had this interesting tingly feeling.</li>
      <li>I also love the smell.</li>
      <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
      <li>However, it didn&#x27;t hurt at all, to me it was more refreshing.</li>
      <li>Love the smell also.</li>
      <li>I love Neutrogena products.</li>
      <li>I still have some of the acne scars but they are getting better with time.</li>
      <li>I tried many years ago</li>
      <li>I love the squeaky clean feeling!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I tend to rush when I wash my face and noticed it doesn&#x27;t feel very clean unless I take my time massaging my face with this cleanser.</li>
      <li>, then when I rinse it off my skin feels amazing, there&#x27;s a light tingling feeling and incredible deep clean sensation!</li>
      <li>It literally makes my face squeaky clean!</li>
      <li>Very pleasant to use, non irritating, cleans great.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a cheap, (mostly) effective  solution to your break outs, this is definitely a facial cleanser to try!you probably won&#x27;t get great results.</li>
      <li>Great product I used it for a couple of weeks and helped clear my face.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and this cleanser has been great.</li>
      <li>The cleanser is awesome, the light creamy texture is much easier to control than liquidy pump-bottle cleansers, which I really appreciate.</li>
      <li>Good products,  very fragrant</li>
      <li>For me, this is good to use in the morning when you&#x27;re face is not exposed to a whole lot of impurities and debris.</li>
      <li>but just want good soap to wash your face with, Deep Clean@ is good, but don&#x27;t get this form of the product.</li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel so clean and smooth!</li>
      <li>feels great.  very tingly and fresh feeling.</li>
      <li>After purchasing it, I quickly fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>The product has a nice scent, not too strong, and it cleans very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found this cleanser does a great job of removing light to moderate oil/dirt from the skin without overdrying.  </li>
      <li>Lighten skin and clean cery well but can be too strong.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is a great genaric version at Walmart - Equate Creamy Facial Cleanser.</li>
      <li>I found a 7 ounce (I believe) bottle at Target for probably $4 or $5, and figured for a price that cheap</li>
      <li>I wash with it daily and it makes for a great morning boost.</li>
      <li>I use an oil free moisturizer after cleansing.</li>
      <li>However, this cleanser is oil free according to its label and so  decided to try it.</li>
      <li>This does not strip your face of oil, the menthol feels good  on the skin and the salicylic acid helps keep skin clear.</li>
      <li>However, while this face wash didn&#x27;t do anything to clear up my skin, I still loved using it.</li>
      <li>I have fair sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;As with any face wash I&#x27;d suggest using a toner after washing to get rid of any residue, but really, this is one of the best facial cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used (I use it in conjunction with [[ASIN:</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very harsh on skin, left me with more acne.</li>
    <li> feels great.  very tingly and fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product because I wanted a cleanser in a squeeze tube so that I could easily use it at the gym.  Pumps are hard to \\&quot;close\\&quot; so that they don&#x27;t accidently pump into my gym bag.  I also wanted a cream cleanser because after I turned 40 skin dryness in my face became more of an issue even though I make sure to drink plenty of water.  I also purchased it for the price.  I didn&#x27;t even notice that the packaging read \\&quot;oil free\\&quot;.  I typically don&#x27;t buy oil free cleansers because I want more oil in the cleanser to moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, don&#x27;t let \\&quot;oil free\\&quot; fool you.  Deep Clean does not dry out my skin.  It works as well as cream cleansers that use the word \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; on their package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of 01/06/2012 Amazon listed this product as costing $5.74 for 7 ounces ($0.82 per ounce) and $19.77 for 21 ounces ($0.94 per ounce).  It does not make sense to me that the cost per ounce for buying in bulk (the three pack which comes to 21 ounces) is MORE than the cost per ounce for buying a single unit.  Buying in bulk usually means saving money.  I will be hitting the \\&quot;1 pack\\&quot; button when I order and then once the item is in my cart I will increase the quantity.  I will not be hitting the \\&quot;3 pack\\&quot; button.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser ever since I tried it out at my friend&#x27;s house. Before, I couldn&#x27;t really find a cleanser that was right for me. It either made my skin too dry or oily, it really differed. I think of my skin as somewhat sensitive, its dry in some places and oily in others.  However, this cleanser is oil free according to its label and so  decided to try it. When I used it at my friends house (her parents work at Johnson &amp; Johnson) so I decided to try it. When I did, it had this interesting tingly feeling. However, it didn&#x27;t hurt at all, to me it was more refreshing. Ever since I use ti, my face feels not oily and not dry, even if I don&#x27;t use lotion. I wash with it daily and it makes for a great morning boost. The refreshing, cooling feeling is great to wake up to in the morning.  I haven&#x27;t changed to another cleanser for about a whole year, and I don&#x27;t plan on it. I love it and I would definitely recommend it to any others why want to try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and stopped using this because of the salicylic acid in it. I changed to the simply clean line. And broke out like CRAZY. Finally switched back to this as it&#x27;s not harmful to the baby since it doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin and absorb a ton just using it for cleansing two times a day. And as soon as I switched back, bye-bye breakouts. I rarely get acne anymore. Unfortunately I ran out last week and went back to the simply clean and my face started flaking because it was so dry and even after using awesome moisturizer that worked great with Deep Clean, my face was flakey! So I&#x27;m ordering more of this today. My face is combination skin. Oily forehead mainly and my nose and between eyebrows is way dry, the rest is pretty normal, and this wash doesn&#x27;t dry me out or feel oily after. It&#x27;s perfect! And when you use it in a hot shower it leaves your face feelings tingly :) definitely try it!</li>
    <li> it smells nice that&#x27;s why it get any stars at all. The product is awful, it removes none of my makeup. It just smears my foundation, only after I go over my eyes with eye makeup remover and a cotton bud and over my face with cleansing lotion and a cotton bud (which is coated in foundation on both sides by the end), does my face feel and is clean. Absolutely hate this face wash, worst I ever bought, will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I love love love this cleanser!!! I&#x27;m changing products all the time to see if I find a better fit, but I always come back to this cleanser! It feels sooo good on my combination acne prone skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out, however I can feel it cleanses very well. I like to leave it on as a mask during the time I brush my teeth (about 5 min or so), then when I rinse it off my skin feels amazing, there&#x27;s a light tingling feeling and incredible deep clean sensation! They say it contains beta hydroxy, so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s acting a little kind of like very light peeling, refreshing your complexion every time...</li>
    <li> While the salicylic acid listed in the ingredients is a miniscule amount and not a medicated dose, why does it seem every Neutrogena product needs to have salicylic acid??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;brighten&#x27; or &#x27;even&#x27; your skin tone or whatever they are claiming. I don&#x27;t care for the menthol either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only plus is it doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry, which can be said for most cream cleansers.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser. Love the smell also. Works great!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t clean my make-up...</li>
    <li> Have been using it for 7+ years. one of the excellent products from Neutrogena. Its so refreshing.  There are no second thoughts on it.</li>
    <li> this is a good product that cleans without drying the facial skin or causing irritation</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING. One time I was showering and realized I did not have any soap or body wash left. Only fools cleanse their body with shampoo, so what did I do? I vigorously scrubbed every inch of my body using Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean Cream Cleanser. Not to be too explicit, but I&#x27;m happy to say that the flaky field of scabs and pockets of puss that once formed around my tail bone are now gone. I say this only because I&#x27;ve seen some acne that rivaled the skin I once had. For those who have already used this product, you know exactly how refreshing it leaves your face feeling... the rest of your body isn&#x27;t exempt from the same feeling. It may not smell like cucumber melon or Old Spice, but your skin will thank you for it.</li>
    <li> I started using this face cleaner when I was in high school. I had a lot of acne with fair, oily skin, so I would always stray towards specifically &#x27;acne fighting&#x27; cleansers. I had lots of issues with other cleansers drying out my skin, the acid causing irritation and further redness, and little success with acne treatment. My mom finally took me to a dermatologist which prescribed antibiotics, a benzoic acid topical ointment, and BC. The benzoic ointment instructions recommended a non salicylic acid face wash to reduce irritation. A friend of mine recommended the neutrogena brand which I had shyed from because it was a little pricy for me, but I heeded her advice. I searched for a non acidic, non oily cleanser, non mature-skin cleanser and picked out this one.   The cleanser is awesome, the light creamy texture is much easier to control than liquidy pump-bottle cleansers, which I really appreciate. It has a great smell and a slight refreshing tingle(not the sting of acidic washes). And it works wonders for my skin. Somehow, it manages to even my complexion so that I look better than when I used foundation/powder with other cleansers, even though I don&#x27;t use a toner. My skin has becomed more and more healthy now that I no longer wear daily foundation. It leaves skin soft, with no oily residue, and there is no drying effect. My acne went away also, though I was on other treatments as well (and it has stayed away). Between growing out of teenage acne and this cleanser, my skin is now very even-toned, my pores have shrank, and the only redness is a natural blush on my cheeks. My only complaint would be that the tube design makes it a troublesome to get all the cleanser out of the tube, however, I will be using this cleanser until it is discontinued.</li>
    <li> Most people looking for Neutrogena already know what it is. But don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking this product here is the same Neutrogena orange liquid in cream form. It&#x27;s not. They changed the formula on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the Deep Clean® pump soap that I loved, but when I ran out my drugstore only had this so I got it. This stuff stings the face; in fact, it reminds me of Noxzema. I still had my old bottle and compared the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Deep Clean® Facial Cleanser in the pump bottle: Purified Water, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate (aids wetting; makes water soak your washcloth easier), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (foam maker), Sodium C12-15 Pareth 15 Sulfonate (another wetting agent), Salicylic Acid (not aspirin, but a chemical exfoliant), Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate (stabilizing oil), Disodium EDTA (anti-binding agent), Propylene Glycol (no, not antifreeze, but a chemical thickener), FD&amp;C Yellow No 5, DF&amp;C red No. 40, Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Deep Clean® Cream Cleanser: Water, Cetyl Alcohol (a skin-softening wetting agent), PPG-15 Stearyl Ether (emulsifier; helps oil bind with water), Methyl Gluceth-20 (wetting agent), Salicylic Acid, Steareth-21(emulsifier), Gelatin, Steareth-2 (emulsifier), DEA-Cetyl Phosphate (emulsifying wetting agent), Menthol, Polysorbate 60 (thickener), Disodium EDTA, Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay attention to the menthol. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s burning my face. Mind you, when I say burning, we&#x27;re not talking 3rd degree with scars here. It tingles, like Noxzema. The tingle doesn&#x27;t last. But I personally don&#x27;t want tingle with my Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used part of it so I can&#x27;t return it, and after all, it does clean well, but I&#x27;d much rather have the plain, ordinary soap that&#x27;s in the pump bottle, only without the pump bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is that if you don&#x27;t mind the Noxzema feel, but don&#x27;t actually want to use Nozxema for whatever reason, this is good. If you&#x27;re like me and hate Noxzema but just want good soap to wash your face with, Deep Clean@ is good, but don&#x27;t get this form of the product. Find the pump bottle or the bar. And by all means, if you do decide to use it, don&#x27;t use this on your baby&#x27;s skin, and when it says avoid contact with eyes, brother they mean it!oxzema but just want good soap to wash your face with, Deep Clean@ is good, but don&#x27;t get this form of the product.

    <li> It&#x27;s not as drying as other clearing cleansers, but still a bit drying.</li>
    <li> I like this face wash.  It is creamy and doesn&#x27;t have the beads in it.</li>
    <li> I have used this everyday for years. I let it sit on my face for about 3 minutes while I am in the shower. If you let it sit it has a nice tingly sensation. It keeps the acne away.  I have sensitive skin, and this cleanser has been great. I use a different cleanser to wash my makeup off as this cleanser is too strong to be anywhere near my eyes.</li>
    <li> Very good cleanser, is soothing to skin, too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this often but when I do it feels great to my skin.  It cleans well, removes oil and dirt.  I like how does not cause that overdrying feeling once it dries.  It also seems to have a cooling aid too so if I happen to clean to harshly I won&#x27;t tell.  For those who wear makeup from my understanding it&#x27;s a good at removing it before bedtime.  This does cost a few bucks more than its competition Noxzema -- I don&#x27;t see a big difference besides you paying for the name.  Nevertheless pretty good facial cleaner.</li>
    <li> Amazon Verified Purchase&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the good reviews fool you especially if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;When I started using this product I thought it could help me to keep my face clean instead it Overdry my Skin also burned.. This was the worse experience I ever had with my skin Please if you don&#x27;t want this to happen to you don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> At 53 years old I started to break out a little...what a surprise to me!  I strated using &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; type cleaners and my skin would feel so tight, and dry and at my age I need moisterizing...I have tried moisterizing and it would make me break out...no hope.  I tried this and I love it! It did not clear up the pimple I had....BUT it did keep me from continue to get them and my skin feels so soft!  Without the break outs.  Funny thing is since I have been using this people keep saying &amp;#34;what is different about you lately...you look younger&amp;#34; this is my secret!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena and I have been kicking it since middle school when acne became a huge problem for me. I always used the Neutrogena Deep Cleanser (Orangey Gel Cleanser) and it helped my skin clear really well considering that my mother and I had tried everything including Proactiv. I used it throughout middle and high-school occassionally dealing with the tiny pimple here and there. However, I decided to switch things up a bit and try a different cleanser now that I am in my early twenties. Let me tell you that this stuff is absolutely amazing. My skin looks and feels way better with the cream cleanser versus when I was only using the gel wash. I love the tingly sensation I get when I apply it to my face ( Think Noxzema ), and overall it really helps to deep clean. I have really oily skin (all over) and this helps to control the oil while purging my pores. In addition to using this product, I swear by Witch Hazel toners which def help to keep my skin really clear and youthful.</li>
    <li> What more could you ask for thick creamy and really clears up my skin. Didn&#x27;t dry me out and smells neutral.</li>
    <li> I  absolutely LOVE this product. Just within the first night i saw results the next morning. My face was smoother and less oily, even through out the next day. I would HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> Most of the complaints here are about how this cleanser doesn&#x27;t get rid of their makeup. Well this isn&#x27;t a make-up removing product, or at least, that&#x27;s not it&#x27;s main purpose. And I agree with other people saying to leave it on for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to rush when I wash my face and noticed it doesn&#x27;t feel very clean unless I take my time massaging my face with this cleanser. But it is worth it because it&#x27;s hydrating, and does brighten my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is a con or if it&#x27;s just my skin type (dry, sensitive, acne-prone) but I notice after a while that it becomes less effective at clearing up acne. I have to alternate with another cleanser every few days to get it&#x27;s full benefits.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and its fantastic! I actually can&#x27;t wait to use it and the end of the day! It makes your skin feel so clean and smooth! I have an apricot scrub I use first, and then I use this, then finally I use some lotion and my skin feels amazing! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that it would clear up my blackheads, but it hasn&#x27;t really. But no other pimples or blackheads have popped up since I started using it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is a great genaric version at Walmart - Equate Creamy Facial Cleanser. It is about 2.97$ about 3 dollars less this this, So since Im cheap I go with the Equate. Both work amazing!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin with the occasional zit, and I use retin-A creme at night so I was hesitant to try this at first. But I decided to try it after hearing all the good reviews.  This leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry, unlike all the other acne cleansers I tried. Great product!  I bought 3 tubes and have been using it for over a year.</li>
    <li> This cleanser makes skin feel clean, yet very soft. The scent is subtle and pleasant. I can&#x27;t say the salycilic acid does anything, but if you want a cleanser to take some makeup and dirt off without leaving your skin stripped of moisture, I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Senior citizen who still gets the occasional breakout.  This does not strip your face of oil, the menthol feels good  on the skin and the salicylic acid helps keep skin clear.</li>
    <li> This face wash leaves a fresh, almost minty feeling and works great at getting off the days dirt. I love the squeaky clean feeling!</li>
    <li> i love neutrogena products they are great for skin care. i use all of them and this one was really great.</li>
    <li> Excellent for sensitive and oily skin. I&#x27;m trying to find a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry my face out but deep cleans well. This seems to be working great. I use an oil free moisturizer after cleansing.</li>
    <li> I recommend this, and all Neutrogena products.  They&#x27;ve done well for me, for the past quarter century.  You will enjoy the tingly full cleansing of this face wash.  However, if you have super sensitive skin, you may want to steer away from this one, and try something a little lighter, perhaps with cucumber in it.  This deep cleanser can cause a bit of burning, and reddening of the skin.  This, of course, dissipates.  Otherwise, I would not continue using the product.</li>
    <li> Good products,  very fragrant</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this product for years through Amazon. I&#x27;ve price shopped for it at various stores and still I have not found this size and this price anywhere. I just hope it doesn&#x27;t go up! The product has a nice scent, not too strong, and it cleans very well. Definitely will continue to use and purchase.</li>
    <li> Me and my wife both have used this product and get really clean feeling but depending on your skin it can burn a little as well.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend swears by this stuff. I&#x27;ve used it before and it does feel good, but it seems a bit pricey for me. That being said, she&#x27;s addicted to it, and with subscribe and save it&#x27;s slightly cheaper than getting it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I needed a cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my face. I am happy my skin is flaking and I&#x27;m not breaking out anymore. Doesn&#x27;t really clean eye make-up though.</li>
    <li> I have been a long-time devotee of this Neutrogena face wash.  It is a thorough, deep clean, and leaves my skin feeling soft and toned.  Plus, the tingling sensation is now a part of my morning wake-up routine.  I was thrilled to find this available on Amazon, and the ability to subscribe is a great deal!</li>
    <li> It really deep cleans and tingles, but if I use it more than once a day my face starts over -producing oil. But as a once-a-day cleanser it has really helped clear up my cystic acne.  Over cleansing/scrubbing made it worse, but just this product and warm water made it better. Also, best to moisturize after to keep skin smooth</li>
    <li> Lighten skin and clean cery well but can be too strong. I skip using for a few times and resume when feeling too tense</li>
    <li> I used this for a long, long time. I love the creamy texture, the fresh/tingly feeling it leaves and the way it smells, but it seemed to have made my acne worse. First it made my skin dry and a little flaky, but that stopped once I switched from using it twice a day to once at night. Then I noticed I was getting small pimples on my forehead and cheeks. After washing with the cleanser my face was soft and the smaller pimples disappeared. Somewhere throughout the day the small pimples would come back and grow into whiteheads. Even after it broke me out I continued to use it, thinking my skin would get used to it and clear up eventually but I was wrong. It&#x27;s great for acne on other parts of the body though, I use it on my chest and back in the shower and it clears up breakouts and makes my skin smooth. I might try it on my face again in the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t so dry, since it&#x27;s a lot of cleanser to waste.</li>
    <li> I have an oily forehead with dry nose and cheeks. I get blackheads and sometimes acne, especially if I don&#x27;t follow my skin reggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this with some other Neutrogena products for about 8 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is white and creamy. It tingles on the skin if you let it sit for a few minutes. I let it sit on my face while brushing my teeth or during the shower, then rinse with cool water. I use every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin reggie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Cream Cleanser every morning&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser OR Neutrogena Blackhead Cleaners as a wash every morning, as a mask once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Formula 10.0.5 mud mask once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Apricot Scrub once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change pillowcases every few days&lt;br /&gt;Use a separate towel for face only, change every few days&lt;br /&gt;Wash face morning and night&lt;br /&gt;Follow with moisturizer always and sunscreen for the day on top of moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Try not to touch my face, don&#x27;t pick blemishes</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser to use with a Clarisonic. Unfortunately, it has absolutely no \\&quot;foam\\&quot; to it, so the Clarisonic just feels dry against my skin. I also don&#x27;t like the fragrance at all. It smells fake and perfumey. Lastly, it does not remove makeup very well, and I wear very little makeup to begin with. Overall, I am very dissatisfied with this cleanser. I have used the Alba Botanica ACNEdote Deep Pore Wash and the Alaffia Neem &amp; Black Soap Skin Recovery Facial Cleanser from Amazon, both with far better results.</li>
    <li> Not as good as expected.  I bought this because of the ratings, but it is was not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone, oily to combination skin and this is a nice cleanser to use in the morning. For me, this is good to use in the morning when you&#x27;re face is not exposed to a whole lot of impurities and debris. The cleanser gives you a nice refreshing feeling when you splash your face with cold water because it contains menthol, kind of like when you chew mint flavored gum and afterwards drink water. Using this however, at the end of the day (at night) does not clean my face super well because I get super oily when I come back from school/work. This cleanser is affordable and is a nice &amp;#34;wake me up&amp;#34; cleanser to use in the morning. It is very refreshing and does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the creamy feel of this face cleaner on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have adult acne and normally use acne wash but I switched to this after I found out that my face was way too dry all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wash seems to work just as well on my acne (though I do use Neutrogena&#x27;s Acne Stress Control Night Cleansing Pads most nights as well to prevent breakouts) but it leaves my skin feeling both tight and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for years and I love it.  It does a good job cleaning your skin, while also leaving it soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago I switched over to Biore Combination Skin Balancing Cleanser.  In comparing the two products, the Biore does a much better job cleansing your skin.  When I am wearing make-up, the Neutrogena Deep Clean always left a little reside behind.  The Biore, however, never did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, after using Biore for 3 months, I decided to go back to Neutrogena for daily use.  The Biore was just too drying.  I never had a problem with dry skin with Neutrogena.  So, back to what I used for years before.  I&#x27;ll still use the Biore for the few times a week that I wear make-up...but, for every other day, I am going to use Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband also uses this and loves it as well.</li>
    <li> It feel good when i rub on i feel it working but thats about it. I dont feel that much of a difference</li>
    <li> Great product I used it for a couple of weeks and helped clear my face. I have  two tone skin oily and dry  so worked for me .</li>
    <li> i like this wash its very good, i have a lot of blackheads and it does work to clear them up and leaves your face feel very very clean.</li>
    <li> It is the worst ever!</li>
    <li> This product is great for everyday use and wont strip the skin like a lot of other cleaners I have tried before. It cleans the skin well, and even removes foundation. It doesn&#x27;t leave my dry skin feeling sensitive. I also like the glow it leaves. Having been in the fashion and entertainment business, I am very particular on making sure my skin looks its best and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found. Its my go to staple skin cleansing product. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have oily, sensitive skin, and this cream wash leaves my skin feeling tingly clean without making my face red or peeling. Does not foam when you use it, but the tingling lets you know if you&#x27;ve missed a spot!</li>
    <li> I like this face wash. I love Neutrogena products. I use this on my face every morning. I have fair sensitive skin. At first, it made my skin dry out a bit from everyday use. I had to switch to every other day. Does not lather as much as I would like, but I still feel tingly clean after washing.</li>
    <li> Has a low PH which is good for my face. Meaning, has a more alkalized ph balance rather than a acidic, which dries my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for years. I&#x27;ve tried many others (including more expensive products) but always come back to this.</li>
    <li> I have tried SO many products to remove acne and clear break outs. For me, break outs are hereditary and I will break out on my face, back, and chest at the thought of stress. (Or just about anything else!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as facial washes go, this has to be one of the best as well as the cheapest. Most facial washes are very expensive, and come in small bottles. I found a 7 ounce (I believe) bottle at Target for probably $4 or $5, and figured for a price that cheap I had to try it! After purchasing it, I quickly fell in love with it. It helps my break outs a lot, though it doesn&#x27;t clear them up entirely. This seems to help better than any other product I&#x27;ve used, even the more expensive Neutrogena facial cleansers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This facial cleanser like all others has a few quirks that are less than user friendly- the main one being the ability to dry out your skin in the blink of an eye. OK- it&#x27;s not quite that bad, I&#x27;ve had worse. This cleanser dried out my skin pretty quickly the first time using it, but it seems the more I use it the less it actually does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is kind of strange, though it&#x27;s not strong. I don&#x27;t believe there are any perfumes added to this product, which is probably why. You have to keep this on for a little while, almost forget about it and leave it to start drying before it really seems to work extremely effectively. I still have some small pimples in some areas no matter how much I try to rub this in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream seems very thick, and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use a whole lot of it. After about a month of using it I am just now running out of my first bottle. For someone who doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of money like myself, a cheap facial cleanser which lasts a long time is a must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is great! I use it every day before applying make up and after taking it off at night. However, buyer beware- if you can&#x27;t stick to it, this probably isn&#x27;t right for you! If you don&#x27;t use it every night and morning, you probably won&#x27;t get great results. There were a few times I skipped using it in the morning and the next few days were like when I first started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap, (mostly) effective  solution to your break outs, this is definitely a facial cleanser to try!you probably won&#x27;t get great results. There were a few times I skipped using it in the morning and the next few days were like when I first started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap, (mostly) effective  solution to your break outs, this is definitely a facial cleanser to try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> It literally makes my face squeaky clean! I can;t rave enough about it, best cleanser for the price! Do it!</li>
    <li> This product is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever tried from Neutrogena.  I love Neutrogena Liquid or Solid Facial Cleaning Formula: http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Fragrance-Liquid-Cleansing-Formula/dp/B003BMI628/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1358102195&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;neutrogena+facial&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product will not clean at all.  It is like rubbing hair conditioner on your face!  I have to use it 3-4 times just to get a little cleaner than when I started.  It is NOT a \\&quot;DEEP Cleaner\\&quot; for your face.  The product highlighted above is much better and gentle as well.  Wish they continued to sell this in the store, but I guess that&#x27;s what Amazon is for :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser for my husband. He was looking for something simple to help his complexion and he loves this stuff! I was sharing my own personal cleanser with him at first, but he didn&#x27;t like that. I decided to try this for myself a couple of times. It doesn&#x27;t foam, but it leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean. I also love the smell. With regular use, I have noticed a change in my husband&#x27;s skin for sure. Good stuff! It looks smoother and brighter.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant to use, non irritating, cleans great.</li>
    <li> I started using this cleanser last year, and I can honestly tell you that my skin has never looked better. When you rub in this cleanser it creates a cool, tingly sensation -- you can literally feel it working into your pores, and the creamy consistency makes it easy to apply just the right amount. It does a wonderful job of helping to prevent acne and blackheads without drying out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My forehead and cheeks are prone to dermatitis and used to get dry and flaky with the cleanser I&#x27;d been using, which was actually also a Neutrogena product: the Deep Clean Facial Cleanser for Normal to Oily Skin. It worked for me for a while, but eventually it started to dry me out (which caused more breakouts). I decided to try to cream cleanser based on its superior reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did: something about the composition of the cream cleanser must make it milder than the other product, because I haven&#x27;t had a problem with dryness or secondary breakouts since I made the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any face wash I&#x27;d suggest using a toner after washing to get rid of any residue, but really, this is one of the best facial cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used (I use it in conjunction with [[ASIN:B00006FE2Z Neutrogena Oil-Free Deep Clean Gentle Scrub, 4.2 Ounce]], and it&#x27;s the best skin-care combo I&#x27;ve ever tried). I hope it works just as well for you as it has for me!</li>
    <li> I have the most stubborn skin in the world! So I&#x27;ve pretty much given up on trying to fix it with normal products. However, while this face wash didn&#x27;t do anything to clear up my skin, I still loved using it. I love the tingly sensation on my skin after using it, it really makes my skin feel so clean. And it also leaves it feeling pretty smooth. Definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Since I started using this product in combination with others my face has cleared up from all zits. I still have some of the acne scars but they are getting better with time. I use this cleanser every morning after this I use Clinique&#x27;s toner and then their moisturizer for acne prone skin. I follow these steps everyday and I have great results!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff with the Clarisonic Mia, which is perfect - you really have to leave this stuff on your face for at least 1 minute to get the most benefit from it.  It leaves a slightly greasy feel to your face after you wash it off.  Not in a bad or pore-clogging way, just in a pleasant \\&quot;not squeaky clean, not tight\\&quot; way.  I can even get away with skipping the moisturizer at night in the summer.</li>
    <li> I Use it every night with my clarsonic Mia and I love the way it makes my skin feel soft and clean</li>
    <li> My skin is oily and this didn&#x27;t seem to work for me. I found the cleanser to be a  bit too thick for me. Could have done with some more granules in it.</li>
    <li> I have moderately oily skin and like to wash my face a couple times a day. This face wash is astringent enough to remove the oils and still allow me to use it a couple times a day without completely drying out my face.</li>
    <li> A all time product. I tried many years ago and I never lived it! Its really a great product and a great price.</li>
    <li> I do love this cleanser above all other cleansers. It doens&#x27;t leave my skin feeling so dry like others and it isn&#x27;t as harsh to my skin as facial scrubs. It leaves my skin feeling very refreshed, and I have no problem with acne breakouts or anything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this cleanser does a great job of removing light to moderate oil/dirt from the skin without overdrying.  It is a cream based cleanser with no abrasives in it, so it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually rub a little bit on my skin with my hands, then wash it off with water.  This is good for when you just need a light cleansing.  You can put a little on a wash rag, then rub your skin with the rag if you need a more robust cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this product.  I have very dry skin and I was my face daily with this product.  Worthy purchase.</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;-Works well for individuals such as myself who have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Large bottle that goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;-Have not found a face cleanser that works even half as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-I forget to use it everyday.</li>
</ol>
