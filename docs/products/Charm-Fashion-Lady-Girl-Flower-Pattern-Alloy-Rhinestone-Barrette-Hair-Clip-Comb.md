<li> the flower part is plastic as expected, and the comb part and the back is a delicate bendable metal.</li>

<li> Too heavy to stay in your hair</li>
<li> and i have small hands)</li>
<li> They weren&#x27;t broken, nor missing anything neither.</li>
<li> Product of poor quality.</li>
<li> I am sad...</li>
<li> I hate that I had to ask for a favor but, at least they still arrived too.</li>
<li> Broken when delivered really disappointed....</li>

    <li> My hair is a little fine to hold this piece in place.  It tends to slip out so I have to use bobby pins to keep it where I want it..  But, the piece itself is great.  I have the champagne color and it&#x27;s pretty and doesn&#x27;t look cheap or gaudy at all..</li>
    <li> Loved the stones in hair comb.went great with my dress.got lots of compliments .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but fell apart on my second wear</li>
    <li> This is very pretty but unfortunately not well put together . We were fortunate that all of the pieces fell apart within a few days and all in the house . We were able to find all of it and glue it back together . My grand daughter just loves it .</li>
    <li> Too heavy to stay in your hair</li>
    <li> I like how it Looks it&#x27;s just perfect. I like how easy is to use on my hair . It my favorite charm</li>
    <li> the clip is very beautiful. the color is vibrant and the only cons i have are the size and quality. it is a little smaller than it appears in the picture (it&#x27;s a little larger than my palm and i have small hands) as for the quality it is well worth the cost, and is very good considering, but i would definitely recommend being careful with it. it is very likely to break if dropped. the flower part is plastic as expected, and the comb part and the back is a delicate bendable metal. overall it is a very beautiful piece and well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This hair comb is very pretty. It&#x27;s big and eye catching- perfect for formal occasions. A few of the rhinestones popped off after a while but nothing a little super glue can&#x27;t fix :)&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid, I&#x27;m happy with what I got.</li>
    <li> although this took forever to arrive I was excited when I took it out of the box  - it was beautiful and sparkly.  I ordered the champagne color but upon wearing only once it fell apart.  I may try to glue it back together but was very upset and disappointed that it fell apart.  I am sad...because it was beautiful.</li>
    <li> So cute I love it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love how it looks on my hair</li>
    <li> It  was  a dark gold not Champagne which I couldn&#x27;t use. Big difference in color.  They were to big and heavy to use or even stay in my hair..</li>
    <li> Product of poor quality. Already received the product with the stones falling. I have no courage to use.</li>
    <li> This item came on time..I must add it took three long weeks too, but, I realized that thru the waiting, and all, when I received them today I wrote and apologized to this seller. If I could I&#x27;d give them ten stars for both and for the wait. I probably would say that I wouldn&#x27;t go this long waiting again on this item. It was much too far away to order it. I ended up with three combs now. But, what counts is that they did come, even though there was much confusion on my behalf. They weren&#x27;t broken, nor missing anything neither. Looked exactly like the item shown. Very beautiful! I&#x27;m happy finally. I hate that I had to ask for a favor but, at least they still arrived too.</li>
    <li> The color at the center is not as intense as the picture but I still like the item.</li>
    <li> Well made. I got the yellow/gold and I like these hair pieces. So modestly priced and well constructed. It is a bit smaller than it might show on the model (who has a small head I think). It&#x27;s not small though by any means. I decent size. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> It came earlier than expected!&lt;br /&gt;Very beautiful hair comb, can&#x27;t wait to wear it!&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I will buy more colors of these.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very cute and holds my thick hair very well!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and strong built.  I like wearing these.</li>
    <li> I wish I had ordered these in another color - it is simply a gorgeous hair clip. Everyone has been asking where I got it from. I&#x27;m still can&#x27;t believe the price of such a lovely piece of hair jewelry! It takes a long time to arrive but it&#x27;s well worth the wait! I would buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> Amazing buy on these hair ornaments.</li>
    <li> This item came to me is not the same item that is in the photo, the photo has comb crystals, which get me does not.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty but it&#x27;s very big for a little girl</li>
    <li> Broken when delivered really disappointed....</li>
    <li> The decorative top broke away from the comb the 3rd time I wore it.</li>
