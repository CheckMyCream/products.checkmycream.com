      <li>I absolutely LOVE this mouthwash!</li>
      <li>wish it were available on Prime, but what the hell!?!</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and tastes great.</li>
      <li>In a perfect world, we would all be made aware of the pros and cons of these added chemicals so that we can make our own decision to use it or lose it, but in the case of Fluoride the decision is being made for us.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>I heard he was amazing.</li>
      <li>it check this website and make your own decision -</li>
      <li>so I take responsibility for my own actions.  </li>
      <li>What I really liked though, was that he didn&#x27;t scold me or force me to give in to fluoride.  </li>
      <li>This mouthwash is a nice option for a fluoride rinse.</li>
      <li>However, I started to get used to it and liked it.</li>
      <li>Since I started using it, I&#x27;ve experienced a significant decrease in the number of cavities.  </li>
      <li>It tastes great- minty but not painfully so.</li>
      <li>My dentist told me that I should use a florid mouthwash to protect my teeth&#x27;s enamel, and he&#x27;s been very pleased with my latest check-ups.  </li>
      <li>The taste is pleasant and mild.  </li>
      <li>The taste is as good or better than the original.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I like this one better.  </li>
      <li>Best fluoride rinse I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t have extra chemicals in it.  </li>
      <li>I like the ACT bottle better because you can squeeze it to get the rinse in the top of the bottle</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s better for me</li>
      <li>and the dentist is pleased that its helping in between brushings.</li>
      <li>This time, I wanted something that&#x27;s more refreshing</li>
      <li>like so many others do.</li>
      <li>this seems to be the better product of its type, I chose to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Tried many rinses for gum problems and the beginnings of gingivitis.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s convenient, but Act&#x27;s bottles are even better where you just squeeze the bottle</li>
      <li>Hopefully there will be no issues. :)</li>
      <li>Hopefully there will be no issues. :)</li>
      <li>There is a touch of saltiness that is exacerbated by the cloying sweetness of conventional toothpaste, but I make my own toothpaste and find this rinse to be a perfect accompaniment.</li>
      <li>This brand fit the bill and we love it.  </li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t make something pleasant tasting, particularly mouthwash, then why bother?</li>
      <li>Not great but hoping it&#x27;s good for my teeth. :D</li>
      <li>so I hope it&#x27;s also promoting strong teeth.</li>
      <li>My family made the decision years ago to eliminate all fluoridated products from our lives, and since then our oral and general health has been greatly improved.</li>
      <li>Quick tip!</li>
      <li>It has a light mint and aloe taste.</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that it&#x27;s available through subscribe &amp; save.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it has no artificial sweetness or SLS.</li>
      <li>Purchased this after I got braces put on, to use as a rinse after eating - as it is especially important to ensure that no food particles, sugar, or bacteria are left sitting in your mouth, in all that metal!</li>
      <li>The taste of this rinse isn&#x27;t great, but I don&#x27;t think any of the other rinses taste any better.  </li>
      <li>Much pricier than the alternatives but happy so far with this!</li>
      <li>your interested in learning more about</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive mouth; this stuff does not cause a problem which is amazing.</li>
      <li>I have been using this fluoride rinse happily for many years because it is not as excessively sweet as other fluoride rinses I have tried and has no artificial colors.  </li>
      <li>but you get used to it quickly.  </li>
      <li>For many of us, as we grow older, our gums recede.  </li>
      <li>I am very familiar with the taste of this product, and the difference with this batch is not subtle.  </li>
      <li>I hope then, that folks realize that the &#x27;wonderful&#x27; Fluoride that&#x27;s put in their oral care products (and our public water) is not naturally occurring.</li>
      <li>I have bought another mouthwash from The Natural Dentist (orange zest), at first it tasted like warm orange soda</li>
      <li>This mouthwash tastes great and doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth like the ones heavy with alcohol do.  </li>
      <li>The Natural Dentist mouthwash contains ingredients that are safe for you to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is fresh and minty, no burn, no artificial colors or sweeteners.</li>
      <li>I love The Natural Dentist products, but we are no longer using floride.  </li>
      <li>I like it because it has no artificial colors or flavors and no alcohol</li>
      <li>It says it tastes like fresh mint, but I just taste &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>There are several varieties of Natural Dentist, but all work great.</li>
      <li>so I chose to get Fresh Mint.</li>
      <li>I trust that it is safe to use, and it does the job as far as we can see on a superficial level.</li>
      <li>As part of the combo mix I use it comes in really handy when you are in a rush or just need to freshen up as well as daily use.</li>
      <li>I use it right before bed, so I don&#x27;t have to remember not to drink/eat.  </li>
      <li>I really feel my teeth clean and doesn&#x27;t taste sweet!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was pleased to find the Natural Dentist fluoride rinse, which seems to have safer ingredients than many of the other rinses on the market (those from many of the large manufacturers).  </li>
      <li>After a year, most of my gum gaps are 2-3mm, where I previously had many 4+ gaps.</li>
      <li>Natural way of getting the fluoride needed to keep your teeth strong and reducing bacteria build up.</li>
      <li>He was very patient, and then he spent a good five minutes looking at my teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>I will use it so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste but going to bed every night with that flavor wont be pleasant.</li>
      <li>It is also very gentle on the mouth tissues (gums, cheeks, tongue) and I find that my gums feel soothed after using this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the only additive-free fluoride rinse I have been able to find.</li>
      <li>the line on the inside of the cap says 15mL. Is this a ploy to get you to use 50% more than necessary?</li>
      <li>In the cap is a measuring line to make sure you use the proper amount.  </li>
      <li>simply hope that by posting this I can increase awareness of this dilemma and help folks become more informed.</li>
      <li>After six months of use, my next checkup went better than all others before.  </li>
      <li>Previously I was using Act, but decided to switch to this brand since it&#x27;s free of dyes and alcohol and is available through subscribe and save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I definitely have noticed a huge improvement in my daughter&#x27;s breath...</li>
      <li>He was very thorough and answered all my questions.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just hoping I can get through the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>Taste really.</li>
      <li>What I really like about this product is that it contains no dyes, or the harmful chemicals</li>
      <li>What I really like about this product is that it contains no dyes, or the harmful chemicals</li>
      <li>I took all this information to heart, and decided that I would try using fluoride again ONLY if it could be delivered in a safe, natural product.</li>
      <li>I took all this information to heart, and decided that I would try using fluoride again ONLY if it could be delivered in a safe, natural product.</li>
      <li>...use it as a pre-rinse in the shower before brushing and also at work as the idea of brushing my teeth in a public bathroom after lunch is kind of gross in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m reminded of the &amp;#34;Big Bang Theory&amp;#34; episode when Sheldon was putting insects in Leonard&#x27;s food to see at what point it tasted &amp;#34;moth-y&amp;#34;. :)  I read the reviews and knew the neg.&#x27;s for the flavor so I take responsibility for my own actions.  I expected it was a strong baking soda taste which some people don&#x27;t like.  I would describe the flavor as though a stink bug was caught and ground with the liquid.  Not great but hoping it&#x27;s good for my teeth. :D</li>
    <li> Most mouthwashes are filled with horrible artificial colors and preservatives. This is the only additive-free fluoride rinse I have been able to find. It is expensive, but worth it. It tastes great- minty but not painfully so. There is a touch of saltiness that is exacerbated by the cloying sweetness of conventional toothpaste, but I make my own toothpaste and find this rinse to be a perfect accompaniment. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I loved this mouth wash... I really feel my teeth clean and doesn&#x27;t taste sweet!!&lt;br /&gt;I will def keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great - there&#x27;s no alcohol so there&#x27;s no burn.  The taste is pleasant and mild.  I have dry mouth quite often and this helps so much!  I use it at night before going to bed and I don&#x27;t wake up with a gluey mouth.</li>
    <li> Purchased this after I got braces put on, to use as a rinse after eating - as it is especially important to ensure that no food particles, sugar, or bacteria are left sitting in your mouth, in all that metal! It is great. The taste is mildly minty and pleasant (just a touch of sweetness, not horribly sweet like conventional mouthwashes). It has been protecting my teeth and keeping them looking their best, even with braces. It is also very gentle on the mouth tissues (gums, cheeks, tongue) and I find that my gums feel soothed after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am especially thrilled that there is NO DYE in this - it is just clear. Those drugstore mouthwashes with the purple, blue, green and orange dyes can probably stain your teeth over time! Not to mention the harmful ingredients they are made of, as well. The Natural Dentist mouthwash contains ingredients that are safe for you to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend to anyone who feels (or has been told that) they need extra protection against tooth decay.</li>
    <li> Long story warning! ~ I bought this rinse to try after having enamel/cavity issues. I went fluoride free for two years (jumped on the hippie bandwagon for my health), only to learn the horrifying truth that this was actually leading to my enamel loss, decay, and tooth sensitivity. :/ My teeth were horrible... receding gums, six cavities, and areas of decalcification despite having excellent oral hygiene. I had been using Earthpaste and/or baking soda, flossing with Oral B Pro Health floss, and rinsing with a xylitol mouth rinse. Upon experiencing my new tooth problems, I visited two different dentists and they both scolded me for not using fluoride. I expected this to happen, and it only made me irritable because I did NOT want to use any fluoride. I saw a third dentist... I heard he was amazing. I actually broke down and cried when he walked in to greet me at the office... \\&quot;I don&#x27;t want to lose my teeth! I need advice!\\&quot; I cried. He asked me to tell him everything about my oral hygiene practises, diet, and oral health history. He was very patient, and then he spent a good five minutes looking at my teeth and gums. He then calmly sat back, looked at me, and then shared with me ALL the information he had about tooth health, and fluoride. He agreed that yes, it is toxic, but it&#x27;s all about dosage. Iodine is an example of a toxic substance, but our bodies need it small doses. Contrary to what some people say, CALCIUM fluoride IS a naturally occurring mineral. There is also a synthetic version (SODIUM fluoride - aluminum waste byproduct that you will hear people talking about). He explained what happens to the tooth surface on a molecular level when fluoride ions make contact... it actually fills in many of the tiny pores, which strengthens and protects the tooth. He was very thorough and answered all my questions. What I really liked though, was that he didn&#x27;t scold me or force me to give in to fluoride.  He simply suggested that, I might be the sort of person who has more of a specific type of oral bacteria that contributes to tooth decay, meaning I could benefit from using fluoride topically in a rinse. This made sense to me, because even though I brush and floss regularly, I still developed cavities. However, my dad and my brother never floss and only brush once a day. They never get cavities! I took all this information to heart, and decided that I would try using fluoride again ONLY if it could be delivered in a safe, natural product. I found this rinse here on Amazon and thought \\&quot;THIS is what I&#x27;m looking for!\\&quot; I bought this with a heavy heart, still feeling a bit disappointed to go back to fluoride (I can&#x27;t find a rinse with calcium fluoride. Even this one contains sodium fluoride, which is why I give it four stars). What I really like about this product is that it contains no dyes, or the harmful chemicals that other conventional rinses have.&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks after using this rinse (I rinse every night before bedtime), I noticed my sensitivity had gone away, my gums were healthier, and my teeth were glistening! I mean, they actually shine like glass! The super-white decalcified spots have also faded a bit and are less noticeable. My next dental checkup and cleaning is in April... I will give an update on my dental health at that time. Hopefully there will be no issues. :)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading. -Lauraore of a specific type of oral bacteria that contributes to tooth decay, meaning I could benefit from using fluoride topically in a rinse.

    <li> As someone who suffers from autoimmune diseases that cause dry mouth and require me to be on medications that further make that dry mouth worse, I (and my dentist) are concerned about the likeliness tooth decay in that inhospitable environment.  Enter Fluoride and Xylitol.  To be clear, I DO NOT care for the way this tastes while it is in my mouth.  However, I have yet to find ANY fluoride rinse that I think tastes good while I&#x27;m swishing with it.  What I DO appreciate are the ingredients in this rinse and the fact that it is sweetened with xylitol.  I was able to purchase this as an Add-On item for a really great price.</li>
    <li> sodium fluoride vs calcium fluoride...hmmm...&lt;br /&gt;As this seems to be the better product of its type, I chose to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it were available on Prime, but what the hell!?! Paid the bloody shipping...&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with the taste and performance, especially given the fact that it contains nothing artificial, nor any preservatives.</li>
    <li> I use The Natural Dentist mouthwashes that contain the least amount of ingredients. They freshen and leave no slick residual film on the teeth. I had to find an alternative to Tom&#x27;s of Maine after Colgate took over and changed the formula; out with the good, in with the Poly&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Though as I read the reviews of most oral care products, it amazes me when I read about how products like this aren&#x27;t \\&quot;filled with horrible artificial colors and preservatives\\&quot; or have \\&quot;as few manufactured chemicals as possible\\&quot;. I hope then, that folks realize that the &#x27;wonderful&#x27; Fluoride that&#x27;s put in their oral care products (and our public water) is not naturally occurring. It is toxic, a bio-accumulative toxin, that is considered by the EPA as hazardous waste! It appears that they have even denounced it- \\&quot;The EPA&#x27;s professional union (including scientists and engineers) is on the record opposing the fluoridation of water. According to their statement, \\&quot;Our members&#x27; review of the body of evidence over the last eleven years, including animal and human epidemiology studies, indicate a causal link between fluoride/fluoridation and cancer, genetic damage, neurological impairment, and bone pathology. Of particular concern are recent epidemiology studies linking fluoride exposure to lowered IQ in children. As the professionals who are charged with assessing the safety of drinking water, we conclude that the health and welfare of the public is not served by the addition of this substance to the public water supply.\\&quot; This should come as no surprise though.&lt;br /&gt; My family made the decision years ago to eliminate all fluoridated products from our lives, and since then our oral and general health has been greatly improved. Incidences of cavities have not increased, but then we also drastically cut back on the amount of sugary processed foods and have eliminated sodas.&lt;br /&gt;I simply hope that by posting this I can increase awareness of this dilemma and help folks become more informed. In a perfect world, we would all be made aware of the pros and cons of these added chemicals so that we can make our own decision to use it or lose it, but in the case of Fluoride the decision is being made for us.&lt;br /&gt;If your interested in learning more about it check this website and make your own decision - [...]&lt;br /&gt;I wish you all the best in life and health!</li>
    <li> Best fluoride rinse I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t have extra chemicals in it.  The taste is a little strange (an off sort of mint), but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to avoid the artificial ingredients in commercial mouthwash. However, the taste is so vile I poured it down the drain.  If you can&#x27;t make something pleasant tasting, particularly mouthwash, then why bother? What a waste of money. Not worth the expense to return it or I would have.</li>
    <li> My daughter said it was so bad but I didn&#x27;t believe her, so I took a mouthful... and out it went. Really this stuff is so bad, do not but it.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I use a rinse, and this is the best one I found.  It is easy to use and tastes great.</li>
    <li> Taste really. Bad. Would like my money back</li>
    <li> Tried many rinses for gum problems and the beginnings of gingivitis.  After six months of use, my next checkup went better than all others before.  My dental hygienist asked what I was doing that was different.  She saw a change and improvement in health of my gums.  All I know is that my gums do not bleed anymore when I brush and floss my teeth.  Have been using for a year and a half now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fluoride rinse happily for many years because it is not as excessively sweet as other fluoride rinses I have tried and has no artificial colors.  However, the bottle of it that I recently purchased via Amazon tastes as though there is something seriously wrong with it.  It tastes toxic.  I am very familiar with the taste of this product, and the difference with this batch is not subtle.  I say &amp;#34;this batch&amp;#34; because soon afterward at a local store I bought another bottle of the rinse with the same lot number (0384) and expiration date (01/16), and it had the same nasty taste.</li>
    <li> I prefer it to ACT --even my kids do.</li>
    <li> It makes my teeth feel cleaner, and they definitely (but transiently) look whiter after I use it. Flavor is a bit strange, somewhat unpleasant, but manageable</li>
    <li> There are several varieties of Natural Dentist, but all work great. No sulphur compounds (yes, companies often put a variant of sodium laurel sulphate, a soap, in mouthwash), glycerine is the main active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this with minor periodontal issues. After a year, most of my gum gaps are 2-3mm, where I previously had many 4+ gaps. Measurable improvement.</li>
    <li> Natural way of getting the fluoride needed to keep your teeth strong and reducing bacteria build up. It also doesn&#x27;t burn your mucosa, which is a big plus in comparison to other mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> Not a great flavor but much better than all those chemical-filled rinses.  I have a very sensitive mouth; this stuff does not cause a problem which is amazing.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is a nice option for a fluoride rinse. It is fresh and minty, no burn, no artificial colors or sweeteners. My 6 year old child enjoys it and asks to use it also. Great product.</li>
    <li> Awesome mouthwash, but overpriced.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this at the local drug stores and the health food stores charge way too much for it...easier to get in on prime and move on...use this in a combo mix of Listerine, hydrogen peroxide, and this in a 1-1-1 mixture...use it as a pre-rinse in the shower before brushing and also at work as the idea of brushing my teeth in a public bathroom after lunch is kind of gross in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m highly sensitive to artificial sweeteners, they taste horrible to me and this is one of the few rinses out there with fluoride in it.  I like the Tom&#x27;s of Maine one as well, but I like this one better.  As part of the combo mix I use it comes in really handy when you are in a rush or just need to freshen up as well as daily use.</li>
    <li> The taste took some getting used to, but after a couple of weeks, it just takes like freshness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the artificial colors, flavors, and sweeteners of other fluoride rinses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One weird thing is that it says to use 10mL, but the line on the inside of the cap says 15mL. Is this a ploy to get you to use 50% more than necessary? Anyway, I just fill it about 2/3 of the way up to the line.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mouthwash! It doesn&#x27;t burn or have artificial tastes like so many others do.</li>
    <li> Only mouthwash I use for my kids.</li>
    <li> I debated for a long time whether to use a fluoride mouthwash, but finally gave in to pressure from dentists who argued that many of my recent cavities could have been prevented if I had been using a fluoride mouthwash.  For many of us, as we grow older, our gums recede.  When that happens, a small area of root surface becomes exposed and vulnerable to decay because root surface doesn&#x27;t have the enamel that protects normally exposed parts of our teeth.  Cavities near the gumline are much more serious, and more likely to lead to extremely expensive restorative procedures, such root canals, crowns or extractions.  In short, I was faced with increased dental expenses for restorative procedures which are not covered by my dental insurance policy.  I was pleased to find the Natural Dentist fluoride rinse, which seems to have safer ingredients than many of the other rinses on the market (those from many of the large manufacturers).  This product doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, for example.  The taste of this rinse isn&#x27;t great, but I don&#x27;t think any of the other rinses taste any better.  Since I started using it, I&#x27;ve experienced a significant decrease in the number of cavities.  Regular brushing and flossing are also essential.</li>
    <li> It has a very bad taste...almost like a super salty and sour vinegar. Definitely not a &amp;#34;fresh mint&amp;#34; taste. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I have avoided fluoride in my toothpaste, tap water etc. and my dentist said I needed fluoride so I bought this Natural Dentist Brand and swish for a minute each evening.  My dentist is happy and so are my pearly whites.</li>
    <li> It does the trick.  doesn&#x27;t taste awful or great, but it is a fluoride rinse.  It tastes similar to Tom&#x27;s fluoride rinse.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have artificial color or flavor.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot and can&#x27;t find this anywhere locally. Good value for price too.</li>
    <li> Unlike some mouth rinses this product doesn&#x27;t stain teeth over time. Great taste and has helped my gums use it every day</li>
    <li> The funny taste or lack of artificial flavors and sweeteners has been tough for me to get used to.  I know it&#x27;s better for me (the colored mouth rinses stain my teeth!) but so hard to get into the habit of using this rinse due to the taste…</li>
    <li> This comes with a cup style cap which I like.  Taste is minty with a hint of citrus.  The only drawback is that the bottle is fairly small, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long as some other products. But, I like it and would recommend.</li>
    <li> The taste is weird. Its like minty cilantro. I hate cilantro.  I will use it so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste but going to bed every night with that flavor wont be pleasant.</li>
    <li> This natural rinse tastes a little strange at first but you get used to it quickly.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now.  I like it because it has no artificial colors or flavors and no alcohol so it&#x27;s not strong like Listerine.  I like the ACT bottle better because you can squeeze it to get the rinse in the top of the bottle and there&#x27;s no separate cup, but I like the fact that this is natural.  I also like the fact that it&#x27;s available through subscribe &amp; save.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing. Does have a slight (weird) aftertaste but very tolerable.</li>
    <li> I agree with the others. The new formula taste is bad! Bitter, chemical taste. This used to be the best tasting mouthwash of them all, but they HAD to screw it up. There is no indication of the formula change on the bottle - the bad tasting one has identical packaging to the great old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the mouthwash for a couple of weeks and sort of got used to the taste. It still tastes pretty bad, but is usable. I&#x27;m raising the rating to three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/27/2014: I took a chance and bought another bottle. The taste is as good or better than the original. Not as strong mint taste as the original, but the weird chemical taste is gone. So either the previous one was a bum batch or they fixed the formula. Very happy about it. It&#x27;s a five star product now.</li>
    <li> My breath feels fresh and I feel like I can actually feel the flouride coat my teeth, unlike ACT.&lt;br /&gt;The kids were also using ACT, but now use the kid version of this product ( Berry Blast). I definitely have noticed a huge improvement in my daughter&#x27;s breath...so I hope it&#x27;s also promoting strong teeth.</li>
    <li> Flouride rinse with out all of the food dyes..Much pricier than the alternatives but happy so far with this!</li>
    <li> This mouthwash tastes great and doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth like the ones heavy with alcohol do.  It&#x27;s a great product and I rather use something I know is natural.</li>
    <li> After cutting-out all artificial sweetener, we needed a replacement for our fluoride rinse.  This brand fit the bill and we love it.  Gross that saccharine is in Act.  No thanks.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with some other reviewers, this mouthwash tastes absolutely DISGUSTING. I have bought another mouthwash from The Natural Dentist (orange zest), at first it tasted like warm orange soda and I didn&#x27;t like it. However, I started to get used to it and liked it. This time, I wanted something that&#x27;s more refreshing so I chose to get Fresh Mint. Let me tell you, it&#x27;s not fresh at all. It seriously is pretty gross, I have to force myself to use it. I still use it because I don&#x27;t wanna waste my money, but I would NOT repurchase.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth and I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals but the taste is pretty bad. I&#x27;m just hoping I can get through the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for about 6 months now and it works well.  My dentist told me that I should use a florid mouthwash to protect my teeth&#x27;s enamel, and he&#x27;s been very pleased with my latest check-ups.  Previously I was using Act, but decided to switch to this brand since it&#x27;s free of dyes and alcohol and is available through subscribe and save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to use it after brushing and swish it around in your mouth for 1 minute.  After spitting it out you are not supposed to rinse, or drink/eat for 30 minutes.  I use it right before bed, so I don&#x27;t have to remember not to drink/eat.  In the cap is a measuring line to make sure you use the proper amount.  It&#x27;s convenient, but Act&#x27;s bottles are even better where you just squeeze the bottle and it fills up the cup automatically and with the proper amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst aspect of this mouthwash is the taste.  It says it tastes like fresh mint, but I just taste &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34;.  On the plus side, eventually you get used to it, but initially... bleh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... a natural fluoride mouthwash alternative.</li>
    <li> I love The Natural Dentist products, but we are no longer using floride.  Do some research about it.  Especially its origins...</li>
    <li> Flavor&#x27;s odd, but not entirely unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Unlike the other reviews we like this product: the scent is refreshing, albeit different, but not bad. Plus it doesn&#x27;t have that usual chemical/unnatural taste that you find in dental product. I trust that it is safe to use, and it does the job as far as we can see on a superficial level.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why others don&#x27;t like the taste, but I do! It has a light mint and aloe taste. I love the fact that it has no artificial sweetness or SLS. I have been using it for 8 months, and since then I have hadone dentist visit. My dentist had nothing bad to say about my teeth! Oh, and just in case you were wondering NO cavities! (I have never had one.) I have it in my subscribe and save plan, so I get 15% off. Quick tip! If you put it in your subscribe and save, choose every two months.</li>
    <li> Bought this for an elderly person that has trouble taking care of their partials and dental all together, and this working out fine and the dentist is pleased that its helping in between brushings.</li>
