      <li>It is seriously the best product out there!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product that we used to use at home on my husband&#x27;s sensitive skin, which has become all the more sensitive due to being incontinent and wheelchair-bound.</li>

      <li>It is a little more expensive than most similar products, but keeping the skin in good shape prevents sores and infections</li>
      <li>It is clean and soothing on my dry skin and also soothes and helps my husband&#x27;s oily skin.</li>
      <li>The staff at his care home tried Cetaphil skin cleanser on him and found it to work better than anything they usually use on patients, so I have it sent to his care facility just for him.</li>
      <li>It has seriously made a huge impact on my life and my face rarely breaks out.</li>
      <li>figured I&#x27;d try going back to my old face wash as the first step to trying to clear up my skin.</li>
      <li>and I have had no breakouts on my face, just some old acne scar healing from now.</li>
      <li>Gentle enough to use for Rosacea</li>
      <li>It has no scent and leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>It is also gentle enough and non scented</li>
      <li>It still does, just nowhere near as badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>We keep a bottle of this right next to our regular soap in all bathrooms.</li>
      <li>My daughter has dry skin and her skin breaks out when using certain products.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t see any major issues with this face wash.</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s been a week later and my skin is almost clear except for the scarring that was done by my birth control and</li>
      <li>but I keep going back to Cetaphil because it leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
      <li>My daughter uses it and it does not dry her skin out.  </li>
      <li>and I think the benefits are well worth a few extra dollars.</li>

<li> Have used this cleanser for years... particularly when traveling &amp; there is a chance that rinsing soap will be somewhat difficult.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter has dry skin and her skin breaks out when using certain products. Then she starts scratching and makes it worse.  This cleanser works great.  Her skins has cleared up while using it.</li>
    <li> Competitive pricing and free delivery, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> i feel like these are not the legit cetaphil make im trying to look into it</li>
    <li> Received as described and as scheduled.</li>
    <li> Best part of this cleanser is that I don&#x27;t have to apply face moisturiser after the cleansing phase. No cracked, peeling or itchy skin. It really is gentle, neutral and helps to keep your skin smooth and supple.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out as harshly as other face washes.  It still does, just nowhere near as badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Cetaphil lotion though which takes care of any dryness I encounter after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it long enough to tell how it will go longterm but I don&#x27;t see any major issues with this face wash.</li>
    <li> Seems to be much more gentle on my kid who has eczema than the body wash that others in the family use.

    <li> My skin was perfect, everyone applauded me, I decided to Cetaphil, thought it was just fighting without acne facial cleanser but I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m too tired, and I don&#x27;t want to experiment, and it has been a month now and I have had no breakouts on my face, just some old acne scar healing from now. Cetaphil is a really great product, my daily therapy is now as simple as washing my face in the morning and evening, after no Frost Ward, no toners or serum, wet wash, rinse and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice, fits me well, this is good</li>
    <li> I have excema on my hands and this soap does the trick. Unlike regular soaps, my hands don&#x27;t feel further dried out or irritated after use. The soap feels silky, cleans, and washes off without leaving a residue. It is also different from other soaps in that there won&#x27;t be tons of suds after use. This is the most gentle and soothing soap I have found. Strongly suggest for others w dermatological issues on their hands.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that we used to use at home on my husband&#x27;s sensitive skin, which has become all the more sensitive due to being incontinent and wheelchair-bound. The staff at his care home tried Cetaphil skin cleanser on him and found it to work better than anything they usually use on patients, so I have it sent to his care facility just for him.

    <li> great product - has helped my skin tremendously without causing any irritation.</li>
    <li> Love Cetaphil for a long time, and I have been used it for about two years. I have a mixed skin type, and it is really like what it promise on the cover, it do works for all skin type, love it.</li>
    <li> My skin can be a nightmare in the winter. It gets red, dry, but yet is prone to break out. And some face washes will really cause it to flare up. My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser and I have been very happy with it. I have combination skin, even though it tends toward the drier side in the winter. My husband has oily skin. This product advertises that it is for all skin types and I agree. It is clean and soothing on my dry skin and also soothes and helps my husband&#x27;s oily skin. It is also gentle enough and non scented so I can use it on my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other sensitive skin cleansers when they have been on sale but I keep going back to Cetaphil because it leaves my skin feeling so soft. It keeps me from having skin flareups and it is a staple in our house.</li>
    <li> For those suffering from ezcema or any other skin irritation, this is the absolute best for routine hand washing.  It even works for semi-regular body washing (and good for little ones with skin issues).  We keep a bottle of this right next to our regular soap in all bathrooms.</li>
    <li> My skin felt oily after using this product - didn&#x27;t clean makeup off my face very well.</li>
    <li> I use it for my face. I&#x27;m missing the suds!</li>
    <li> Gentle enough to use for Rosacea</li>
    <li> A dermotologist told me to use this years ago and I&#x27;ve strayed and tried other products but always go back to Cetaphil. Gentle cleanser that does the job, no perfumes and a good size, last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash, If you have sensitive skin this will do the job and yes I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I was looking for a face wash to help appease the hormonal acne I was getting once I got off of birth control. Gave Cetaphil a shot since I saw rave reviews. I thought my hormones were still trying to re-adjust because a few months later, my skin was still irritated around the cheeks – lots of white bumps and a few big, painful ones. It wasn&#x27;t even improving though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I&#x27;d try going back to my old face wash as the first step to trying to clear up my skin. I saw a change in my skin overnight! Now it&#x27;s been a week later and my skin is almost clear except for the scarring that was done by my birth control and Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually upset I didn&#x27;t stop using Cetaphil sooner. Washing with Cetaphil didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling very clean at all, either. Perhaps it just doesn&#x27;t work out with my oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Must have for anyone.  I use this on my sensitive skin and it removes my heavy eyeliner.  My daughter uses it and it does not dry her skin out.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Perfect item for someone who cant use soap because of sensitive skin/ eczema.</li>
    <li> I wash my face with this and my face gets cleaned. What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> Parabens. I hope they have one that doesn&#x27;t have parabens.</li>
    <li> After years of trying several different face cleansers for my acne and dry face, my dermatologist suggested I try Cetaphil. My face has never been so clear, smooth, and moisturized! It is seriously the best product out there! I only use a dime sized amount every night to wash my face, which is all I need, so the product lasts for a really long time! There is seriously no need to use the strong, over-medicated cleansers out there. Cetaphil is the way to go! It has seriously made a huge impact on my life and my face rarely breaks out.</li>
    <li> My face (and only my face) gets a rash if I use any kind of soap.  This cleanser is extremely gentle but still refreshing with a clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Use it daily on my face. Very easy on my skin while cleaning it thoroughly. Great for a daily cleanser.</li>
    <li> Have used this cleanser for years... particularly when traveling &amp; there is a chance that rinsing soap will be somewhat difficult.</li>
    <li> A lot of moisturizers leave your skin feeling drier than before if you don&#x27;t use them constantly but this stuff does what its supposed to and you&#x27;re no worst than you started when skip an application.</li>
    <li> After using it for a while, I have to say it is really gentle but works pretty good. I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is non-irritating, even when one has to wash ones hands repeatedly, better than soaps that way.  The 3-pak of three 16 oz. bottles is a good deal pricewise, too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. Sunscreen has been clogging my pores and I simply rub this on my face and I wake up blackhead free! So easy to use that it is effortless to use daily. Dermatologist recommended it to me years ago and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. Amazon has a great deal on this when used with subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those who have sensitive skin. You do not even have to wash it off, just wipe it off. It has no scent and leaves skin feeling soft. My dermatologist recommended it and I am glad she did!</li>
    <li> always like this face wash. very good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> i am sensitive to fragrance so i must use products like Cetaphil unscented cleanser.  this cleanser is mild and non irritating and the price was so much less than at CVS or Walgreens.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this cleanser. Worth the price and will continue to purchase.</li>
