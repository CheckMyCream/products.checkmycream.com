      <li>Fast delivery great product</li>
      <li>This will help prevent infections or even more</li>
      <li>3 girls, wife and I just love it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I would create more pimples from using my fingers.</li>
      <li>wish I purchased a greater quantity for friends.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>totally worth it.! :)</li>
      <li>Awesome price for a cute little product.</li>
      <li>, it was easy to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>Did notice i got more than 5 pieces for some reason, which was still cool.</li>
      <li>Rest were fine.</li>
      <li>The item is fine but it took 4 weeks to get it.</li>
      <li>This has helped my skin tremendously since I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
      <li>I am really impressed with this little tool.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I can tell a huge difference in the amount of acne that pops up since I received it.</li>
      <li>Great tool, simple to use &amp; store.</li>
      <li>The upside is that they still work and are dirt cheap.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t way your money on this even if it is cheap.</li>
      <li>Used with a light touch, it removes blackheads and pimples w/o bleeding or scarring.  </li>
      <li>The cleaning is also easy, after you use clean with alcohol.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think it surrounds the blackhead better and puts pressure on more skin, it really does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was so excited to see these on here</li>
      <li>Or maybe it&#x27;s just my pores... worth the price if it pores and you get along well!</li>
      <li>but Im very pleased with results so far.</li>
      <li>Its alright but its pretty much better to use your fingers tbh</li>
      <li>They took 4 weeks to receive, but for the price and the value of this item it was worth it!</li>
      <li>Now his face remains clean and manageable without marks.  </li>
      <li>the females at the club when beyonce put a ring on it comes on lol, remember wash you face first to open pores then</li>
      <li>And to have multiple on hand, great as a give away during a spa night with the girls, or just to have if you start misplacing/losing one or a few lol.</li>
      <li>Love it,  and it really helps alot</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>course there is no cure for acne, but definitely makes you feel better!</li>
      <li>My advice is to spend a little more and get a nice one.</li>
      <li>to my surprise it was well worth the money and</li>
      <li>For the price, very nice little tools.</li>
      <li>I use warm water to open pores first then apply teatree oil to close &amp; disinfect pores.</li>
      <li>especially since it was super cheap for a pack of 5!</li>
      <li>advise you by a great amount and past them out to you friends or you children&#x27;s friends.</li>
      <li>The loop end works great for pesky blackheads, and the comedone extractor performs well, although the eye hole is fairly small.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolute garbage!</li>
      <li>first time using it</li>
      <li>they work very well!</li>
      <li>It does exactly as it was supposed to.</li>
      <li>They work ok, just wished the holes where bigger.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times as it took longer to get than most things I&#x27;ve ordered</li>
      <li>Absolute garbage!</li>
      <li>more red nose or skin from machines or pressure from fingers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First of all, 5 of these for under $3??</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this since our teen son lost the Revlon version we&#x27;d had for many years.  </li>
      <li>if I see something different on my bank account  better  be ready because I will follow you to china.</li>
      <li>but my eyesight isn&#x27;t good enough to place it properly.</li>
      <li>What a great product for so LITTLE money, and it works too !!!  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work like I saw in the video.  </li>
      <li>This is not a panacea for all cases, but eye-hole end works very well with a minimum in skin irritation.</li>
      <li>This was an absolute godsend to me as a pimple popper.</li>
      <li>much more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, it didn&#x27;t cost that much, so I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>It really pushes out the gunk and helps your pores out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&amp; we went straight to the bathroom to try them out.</li>
      <li>It cleared up my blackheads really fast.</li>
      <li>but it goes away, it depends how much pressure is being applied.  </li>
      <li>They work great but one of them on the &amp;#34;spoon&amp;#34; side at the bottom was rough and jagged, other than that</li>
      <li>I bought this for my son, who recently started breaking out, I wanted a product he could use besides his face wash to clean his face without using his hand which can carry a lot of germs.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not too impressed with this tool. Did notice i got more than 5 pieces for some reason, which was still cool.</li>
    <li> There were a couple that weren&#x27;t molded properly and had sharp metal hanging off. I. Discarded those. Rest were fine.</li>
    <li> I am not sure we are using this item correctly, but is causes a little pain extracting blackheads from face. Better than using fingernails, I suppose.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give it a one star rating!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s absolute garbage!</li>
    <li> first time using it and i love it</li>
    <li> Fast delivery great product</li>
    <li> Nice tool, just depends how well it works with what your trying to do/ and what your acne is like.</li>
    <li> excellent product for its intended purpose but they do tent to wear out quickly if used on a regular basis (once or twice a week).</li>
    <li> Its alright but its pretty much better to use your fingers tbh</li>
    <li> PEOPLE PLZ DONT WAIST YOUR TIME ON THIS GARBAGE  when you have to wait 4-6 weeks to get the piece of garbage when thy dont even work get them from the UNITED STATES you will get them in 2-3 days  and get this  it will work believe it or not  people dont be retarded  here</li>
    <li> Finally a blackhead product that worked.</li>
    <li> Mine weren&#x27;t rough like everyone else&#x27;s. It took a month to arrive. It is 5 of the same sized tool. Since it took a long time to get here I ordered one more expensive that has 5 different tools and will use that more often than this one</li>
    <li> Poor quality and these are 5 identical sticks, not 5 various sized/types as it appeared on the listing</li>
    <li> First of all, 5 of these for under $3?? Why not buy them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought blackhead extractors before but I prefer these over any previous ones for one reason: the &amp;#34;eyelet&amp;#34; end. This works better for me than the loop end. I think it surrounds the blackhead better and puts pressure on more skin, it really does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will work better if you soften your skin beforehand, so right out of the shower works the best. And REMEMBER TO SANITIZE both the instrument and your skin before and after every use, and ESPECIALLY right after you receive it in the mail - you don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s been. This will help prevent infections or even more breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course there is no cure for acne, but definitely makes you feel better!</li>
    <li> love it and so useful especially for hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to see these on here so I ordered them....especially since it was super cheap for a pack of 5! When they arrived, I gave one to my 13 year old daughter &amp; one to me &amp; we went straight to the bathroom to try them out. The holes are too big so they don&#x27;t work. We were pushing hard on top of the blackheads but nothing happened except red painful marks. It&#x27;s hard to center the blackheads in the holes as well. Not happy.</li>
    <li> My son likes it but my eyesight isn&#x27;t good enough to place it properly.</li>
    <li> Took a while to arrive so be prepared to wait a bit. Very good quality and good price too.</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Ha don&#x27;t buy this. Just keep using your finger tips these things are ridiculously ineffective</li>
    <li> Beware!! You will find yourself over using these! Lol. They are very good at extracting things from your pores...which can sometimes get angry and rebel if they feel to messed with.  Or maybe it&#x27;s just my pores... worth the price if it pores and you get along well!</li>
    <li> For the price, very nice little tools.</li>
    <li> It does exactly as it was supposed to. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times as it took longer to get than most things I&#x27;ve ordered but Im very pleased with results so far.</li>
    <li> It might be easy to push down on your skin to squeeze out blackheads pimples instead of using your fingers.</li>
    <li> these took a while to get here but they are heavy duty metal will last a long time. this maybe something you will only need to buy one time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what metal they are using, but it rusts... which is not something you want for a product meant to be used on your face.</li>
    <li> So simple and it work wonder!</li>
    <li> This is not a panacea for all cases, but eye-hole end works very well with a minimum in skin irritation.</li>
    <li> This tool has saved my face!! Check out youtube videos from Doctor Vikram Yadav.</li>
    <li> The two different loops should work better but it is underwhelming and does not really do what I expected. It</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t extract anything but make a bunch of little red circles all over my face. I would not purchase it again and I sure didn&#x27;t need five of them.</li>
    <li> Great tool, simple to use &amp; store. Approx. 3 inches long.  The loop is very useful for removing black heads. I use warm water to open pores first then apply teatree oil to close &amp; disinfect pores. Never dig into skin with this tool! Prevents infections and scarring that occur from using fingers &amp; nails. My pre-teen kids use this weekly to maintain complexion.  They misplaced the last one so I ordered another. This offer comes from China with 5 identical pieces, not sure why (plus a funky red string bracelet?).</li>
    <li> Love it,  and it really helps alot can u say good bye scars</li>
    <li> I loved them, amazing works well! Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Hard to use. The hoop end works ok, but the other end is hard to use.</li>
    <li> Other than the long wait for shipping, these things do their job.</li>
    <li> Not worth buying. It IS as illustrated, but once you&#x27;ve got it in hand, it&#x27;s useless. Who knew?</li>
    <li> They work for what they are used for and quite pain free if you use both sides correctly in removing Black and white heads</li>
    <li> Holy cow! I thought I got only 1 and I ended up with like 5 of them and they are very very very GOOD! Very strong durable metal I did not exspect it to be this good. It does hurt tho but I think it&#x27;s just the nut behind the contraption :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, who recently started breaking out, I wanted a product he could use besides his face wash to clean his face without using his hand which can carry a lot of germs.  This product works great, and is very sturdy. Now his face remains clean and manageable without marks.  The cleaning is also easy, after you use clean with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;A.H&lt;br /&gt;Hollywood, Fl</li>
    <li> Smooth loop doesn&#x27;t tear at skin which is great. I recommend sanding the bottom of the scoop though because it ca be jagged sometimes.</li>
    <li> Does not does not does not work. These things are tinny and they just don&#x27;t work unless u rip your skin off ... so disappointed. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Plenty durable and provide the function I expected. Been using it for a couple months now with no change in solidity of construction. The loop end works great for pesky blackheads, and the comedone extractor performs well, although the eye hole is fairly small. Solid construction for the price. I don&#x27;t expect to need more than one for quite some time.</li>
    <li> What a great product for so LITTLE money, and it works too !!!  Not only do you get a great little product, you get FIVE of them !!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what i thought it would...if you press to hard you&#x27;ll defiantly damage your skin....</li>
    <li> My family wanted one of these and this price was perfect.</li>
    <li> This has helped my skin tremendously since I&#x27;ve been using it! I don&#x27;t touch my face anymore when taking care of those pesky little bumps that don&#x27;t want to go away and I can tell a huge difference in the amount of acne that pops up since I received it.</li>
    <li> these did not work for me at all</li>
    <li> l love it, l did a deep scurb on my face , l used it and them suckers came poppin out like  the females at the club when beyonce put a ring on it comes on lol, remember wash you face first to open pores then go to work lol</li>
    <li> i ordered this on December 30 is now January 24 no tracking on this order, no package... o believe this is bull... if I see something different on my bank account  better  be ready because I will follow you to china.</li>
    <li> Side with the metal circle keep bending in the same areas no matter how gentle you press with the tool. I&#x27;m not impressed with it. I&#x27;d recommend a different brand.</li>
    <li> Awesome price for a cute little product. It cleared up my blackheads really fast. Perfect summer time skin! Woohoo yeah</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this little tool.&lt;br /&gt;Being made in China and shipped from China, I thought it would me junk.&lt;br /&gt;But, it didn&#x27;t cost that much, so I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;Well to my surprise it was well worth the money and much more.&lt;br /&gt;I have used vacuumed battery operated and just my fingers and other electric and manual tools on blackheads, zits and oily skin....especially the areas on the nose near the nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;It was cheaper buying 5 than just one with the postage and all.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I purchased a greater quantity for friends.&lt;br /&gt;My 3 girls, wife and I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;There was no directions come with it.&lt;br /&gt;But, it was easy to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;Just put the holed bowl over the blackhead and push down.&lt;br /&gt;The wired end is good for skin scraping and pimples.&lt;br /&gt;The wired end brings the oily deposits to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;My daughters use both ends for blackheads and pimples.&lt;br /&gt;They just switch ends for what works better for them.&lt;br /&gt;No more red nose or skin from machines or pressure from fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Just wash face and it is smiley face till you have to do it again.&lt;br /&gt;I advise you by a great amount and past them out to you friends or you children&#x27;s friends.</li>
    <li> Absolute garbage! Don&#x27;t way your money on this even if it is cheap. The hole that is suppose to extract blackheads is so small you need a magnifying glass to see it and you will never be able to aim the hole over the spot you need it to be in.</li>
    <li> Wow, quite inexpensive.  Could not find in stores!</li>
    <li> Very slow delivery. Product doesn&#x27;t work. Very cheap quality  finishing is very rough it can scratch your face</li>
    <li> These are chrome plated.  The finish is rough and may be abrasive to some people&#x27;s skin.  The upside is that they still work and are dirt cheap.  I will be looking for a different one made from stainless however.</li>
    <li> I hope China doesn&#x27;t wok us too hard after they take over the USA!!!!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> They work great but one of them on the &amp;#34;spoon&amp;#34; side at the bottom was rough and jagged, other than that totally worth it.! :)</li>
    <li> Not good quality, and hard to use.  The metal is covered in a spray on metal it looks like and the shipping took well over a month for me to get them.  Overall not a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it I like tweezers  better</li>
    <li> Seems great. My severely oily skin seems to be less oily now that I&#x27;ve been using this every so often. It really pushes out the gunk and helps your pores out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful to not push too hard or you can risk damaging your skin more than helping it. I ended up having two or so stubborn spots that I actually gave myself a red blood vessel rupture from frustration and overdoing the pressure so learn from my mistake and be gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steaming your face helps (hot bathroom with a shower) or (towel over a turned off boiling pot of water) to open the pores and make the process less traumatic to your pores.</li>
    <li> The item is fine but it took 4 weeks to get it.</li>
    <li> Received 5 &#x27;pimple extractors&#x27; which are of good quality and work well.  Used with a light touch, it removes blackheads and pimples w/o bleeding or scarring.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this since our teen son lost the Revlon version we&#x27;d had for many years.  Would have been 5 stars except the shaft should be shorter, and the wire loop at one end should be a smaller &#x27;scoop&#x27; instead, to ensure longer use-life.</li>
    <li> These little babies are the real deal! Exactly as shown and pricing and shipping are excellent. Will use these for many years to come. Thank You!</li>
    <li> This is much small than it appears on the website. It&#x27;s almost to small to hold and it&#x27;s way to small to effectively use. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was so surprised that it actually works on my face.  It does leave an indent mark on my face but it goes away, it depends how much pressure is being applied.  And to have multiple on hand, great as a give away during a spa night with the girls, or just to have if you start misplacing/losing one or a few lol.</li>
    <li> They took 4 weeks to receive, but for the price and the value of this item it was worth it! I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this tool.</li>
    <li> they work very well! i gave the extras to my friends and everyone seems to use them alot.</li>
    <li> Dont know how to use this...still trying</li>
    <li> awesome.  can&#x27;t compare to others since these are my first blackhead removers, but they work great.</li>
    <li> Works so far. I will not be providing a photo of this in action</li>
    <li> These are the best blackhead removers on the market for at home use! I bought one for everyone in my family!</li>
    <li> This was an absolute godsend to me as a pimple popper. I used to scar up my face so badly and I would create more pimples from using my fingers. Now I don&#x27;t and my face is clearer than ever without using facial products.</li>
    <li> They work ok, just wished the holes where bigger.</li>
    <li> The opening on these was not centered, and the loop metal was too thick. It looks better online...</li>
    <li> The hole in the round portion is way too big. It doesn&#x27;t work except for giant blackheads or pimples. My advice is to spend a little more and get a nice one. When you need it, you want one that works.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work like I saw in the video.  Sorta hit and miss.  Not bad for the price.</li>
