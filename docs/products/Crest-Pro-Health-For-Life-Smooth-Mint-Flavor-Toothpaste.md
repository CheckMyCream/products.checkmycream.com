### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Only time will tell if continued use of CREST PRO-HEALTH FOR LIFE will keep our teeth in their best condition as we age, but I figure it can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>and I am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>It is perfectly pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My dentist is also very happy with this formula.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product!</li>
      <li>Very good minty taste.</li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>I do like this paste as it has a pleasant and not overpowering mint flavor.  </li>
      <li>Surprising my parents for whom this toothpaste was targeted, did not like the texture of the toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>toothpaste is sooo great that I just bought 4 more tubes, just in case they discontinue it.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, I love this toothpaste!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll let you know if something amazing</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say a lot favorable or unfavorable about this product.  </li>
      <li>Seems to do the job using our Sonicare toothbrushes - Dentist says our teeth &amp; gums look fine and says keep up the good effort</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is the answer to a problem that I&#x27;ve had for many years.  </li>
      <li>The 50+ version of the toothpaste is great, and I find it gentle for my teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>you leave the toothpaste on your toothbrush for more than a couple minutes, the toothpaste sort of melts into the bristles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The texture reminds me of a baking-powder toothpaste (although better tasting).  </li>
      <li>I even bought two more tubes.</li>
      <li>Well I can honestly say my teeth feel squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>Easily removed by dentist or dental hygentist</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Pro-Health line of toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Regardless, it is still a great toothpaste, especially for those 50+</li>
      <li>+ is fabulous,</li>
      <li>, Smooth Mint Flavor was given to me for review by Amazon.</li>
      <li>Did not notice any significant whitening though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Leaves my mouth tingly and clean tasting.</li>
      <li>I really loved this product, paste is light and the gritty feel helps polish my teeth.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First, how well does it clean?</li>
      <li>What a difference having the right toothpaste!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to taste like a 5 star restaurant cooked dinner mind you - it is toothpaste (heh), but overall the taste was good, and not \\&quot;Oh</li>
      <li>This toothpaste tastes fine and it cleans my teeth pretty well</li>
      <li>Well, my mouth and breath seem really fresh and clean after using so I&#x27;m sold on that part,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>flavor!&lt;br /&gt;-Mouth feels fresh and clean</li>
      <li>It works, has a mild taste, and is plastic-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is fresh yet mild, as it doesn&#x27;t have the burn of some mintier products which some may appreciate.</li>
      <li>So, it is not only good for people with tooth sensitivity, also the whole family.</li>
      <li>I should say that I also floss regularly and have also had fluoride treatments, so I can&#x27;t say with complete confidence that my great check-ups are strictly on account of this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Because the claim of this specific kind of toothpaste is the kind that I can&#x27;t properly examine and spell out in a review here on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, right?  </li>
      <li>My gums look and feel fine and it does not make my teeth sensitive.  </li>
      <li>She was excited to here of this new toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Perhaps that, combined with my being in the target market, is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
      <li>However it feels quite grainy and I have to rinse pretty well to get that granulated feeling out of my mouth.</li>
      <li>more recently I&#x27;ve been purchasing the Pro-Health, mint flavored, whitening tube.</li>
      <li>Did you change brushing technique or toothpaste or something?&amp;#34; My first thought was this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>but it is also just plain good working toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that my teeth are whiter, and my sensitivity issue is pretty much gone.</li>
      <li>When I say squeaky clean, I mean when you run your tongue around your teeth you can feel how smooth and clean they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s start with taste, unlike several other multi-health toothpastes on the market, Crest Pro-Health for Life has a rather pleasant taste.</li>
      <li>You really can&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>never though much of it until now.</li>
      <li>really like this toothpaste and will continue to buy it.  </li>
      <li>I can say that I have not had any cavities since using this toothpaste and have had several check-ups that have been problem free.</li>
      <li>Paying $5 for something that works maybe as well as baking soda doesn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
      <li>and I am very picky about what toothpaste I use.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t really have a problem with tooth sensitivity</li>
      <li>for this review, how do you say \\&quot;OK, this toothpaste works better for inflamed gums and weak enamel\\&quot; over more &#x27;conventional&#x27; versions of toothpaste?  </li>
      <li>Bright colors in nature often mean toxic ingredients.  </li>
      <li>The taste is just OK compared to other Crest products.  </li>
      <li>And, since I had chemo several years ago, my mouth tissues have been super sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just watched the news and saw where older adults are getting the plastic balls stuck in their gum lines.</li>
      <li>I have used Crest my whole life and think this is perhaps a gentle, sensitive variety of toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Plus, I am getting older, so</li>
      <li>I have used Aquafresh for years, but it did not help with tooth sensitivity as I got older.</li>
      <li>I use the Pro Health line of products and this toothpaste is high quality also.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste is highly buzzword compliant.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>As someone else pointed out in a review here, this kind of thing is hard to \\&quot;truly\\&quot; review.  </li>
      <li>I find that it feels gentle on my gums and does not hurt my sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>So far, it works very well for sensitivity and helps fight stains from the coffee I drink every day.</li>
      <li>The product has a light, natural paste that is slightly gritty, it has the same texture as organic based toothpaste with a very baking soda feel.  </li>
      <li>I had told her about this new find.  </li>
      <li>Also, at my cleaning today, the hygienist said the new toothpaste must be working because my gum tissue is no longer \\&quot;sloughing off\\</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them for other products in the past (such as whitening strips) with very good results.</li>
      <li>I ordered it accidentally because the product name didn&#x27;t make it clear</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not over 50, but I figure that it&#x27;s never too early to start helping my teeth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My 11yr old grandson is sharing the tube with us with no complaints.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The potential long-term benefits are promising and Crest is a company I can trust.</li>
      <li>I read alot of the reviews about this product and that&#x27;s why I purchased it, so far it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
      <li>few months ago, I had another cleaning, and things went a lot more quickly than usual.</li>
      <li>Plus, this one&#x27;s often cheaper than the other Pro Health varieties, and given that the ingredients (and most of the labeling) is the same, I suspect that the only difference is the color, the flavor, and the amount of grit.</li>
      <li>I am not sure I would repurchase as I prefer something a little more refreshing and less grainy.</li>
      <li>I usually use Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste and because my husband has sensitivity, we decided to try Crest Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint Flavor Toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Not all toothpaste I&#x27;ve used in the past gives you this clean a feel.</li>
      <li>I feel a cold twist in my gut, when I see brightly packaged stuff like this.  </li>
      <li>have been using this toothpaste for a couple weeks and there really isn&#x27;t anything about it that distinguishes it from other toothpastes that Crest makes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m too old (70) for bubble gum toothpaste, but I&#x27;ve always been sensitive to the morning BLAST of mint provided by all other toothpastes.  </li>

<li> of things is a highly subjective issue, but for me, this didn&#x27;t taste like that typical taste toothpaste is like.  </li>
<li> I still get the same clean feel in my mouth as my other thick whitening toothpaste.  </li>
<li> The main difference between this Crest toothpaste for people over 50, and other Crest toothpaste varieties is the amount of sodium fluoride it contains, which is the only listed active ingredient on the two Crest toothpaste products I have.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the same little plastic &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; you find in hand soap and liquid body soap that is clogging up municipal water stations and entering our nation&#x27;s natural watersheds.</li>
<li> Other toothpastes for adults are way to strong and irritating.  </li>
<li> But it is not unique to this brand as I have found a few other brands that imparted this squeaky clean feel.</li>
<li> In the past, she&#x27;d given me samples of the Crest for sensitive teeth, but I still could use only a wee bit of that.  </li>
<li> I have been a Crest customer for as long as I can remember-</li>
<li> But I can say this: I&#x27;m intending to stick with this brand as long as the streak continues.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This toothpaste is the answer to a problem that I&#x27;ve had for many years.  Other toothpastes for adults are way to strong and irritating.  I&#x27;ve been using kid toothpaste for years because the others, including Crest, have burned my mouth.  I&#x27;m too old (70) for bubble gum toothpaste, but I&#x27;ve always been sensitive to the morning BLAST of mint provided by all other toothpastes.  And, since I had chemo several years ago, my mouth tissues have been super sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste is sooo great that I just bought 4 more tubes, just in case they discontinue it.  Also, at my cleaning today, the hygienist said the new toothpaste must be working because my gum tissue is no longer \\&quot;sloughing off\\&quot; and all looks well.  I had told her about this new find.  In the past, she&#x27;d given me samples of the Crest for sensitive teeth, but I still could use only a wee bit of that.  She was excited to here of this new toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro-Health for Life 50+ is fabulous, but I&#x27;d take that \\&quot;50+\\&quot; off the label because all of the ills listed on the label are things everyone over 35 has to worry about!!  If you wait until you are 50+, it might be too late.</li>
    <li> What a difference having the right toothpaste! My dentist is also very happy with this formula. My teeth are whiter and there is very little, if any, plaque build up.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use the Pro Health line of products and this toothpaste is high quality also.  Leaves my mouth tingly and clean tasting.</li>
    <li> Stained my teeth brown. Easily removed by dentist or dental hygentist but that&#x27;s NOT FREE.</li>
    <li> What can one say about a toothpaste? Let&#x27;s start with taste, unlike several other multi-health toothpastes on the market, Crest Pro-Health for Life has a rather pleasant taste. I can say that I have not had any cavities since using this toothpaste and have had several check-ups that have been problem free. I should say that I also floss regularly and have also had fluoride treatments, so I can&#x27;t say with complete confidence that my great check-ups are strictly on account of this toothpaste. But I can say this: I&#x27;m intending to stick with this brand as long as the streak continues.</li>
    <li> I read alot of the reviews about this product and that&#x27;s why I purchased it, so far it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say a lot favorable or unfavorable about this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now.  I ordered it accidentally because the product name didn&#x27;t make it clear it was for people over 50. I happen to be over 50 (51) but not suffering from any of the conditions it&#x27;s supposed to be helpful with.  The taste is just OK compared to other Crest products.  It seems to be doing no harm.</li>
    <li> When I chose the CREST PRO-HEALTH FOR LIFE TOOTHPASTE, I didn&#x27;t realize that this was marketed and intended for people over 50. I&#x27;m not over 50, but I figure that it&#x27;s never too early to start helping my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using the CREST PRO-HEALTH FOR LIFE for the past 2-3 months, daily (morning and night), and my teeth do look slightly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally, I get some sensitivity in two spots when brushing (I use [[ASIN:B002CVTVVY Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]), but it isn&#x27;t constant and tends to come and go and only happens when I brush, so I&#x27;m not sure if using the PRO-HEALTH actually made it stop, but the sensitivity isn&#x27;t there when I brush now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like some others have noted the toothpaste does have a gritty texture, but I don&#x27;t mind that at all because I figure that helps polish my teeth better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it tastes like Aim \\&quot;fight the cavity creeps\\&quot; Toothpaste that some of you might remember from the 70s, which has a minty-wintergreen flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell if continued use of CREST PRO-HEALTH FOR LIFE will keep our teeth in their best condition as we age, but I figure it can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> this toothpaste, made my gums, and lips, swell up. I have not had this happen to any of the other crest products. will not use again.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest my whole life and think this is perhaps a gentle, sensitive variety of toothpaste. It is fresh yet mild, as it doesn&#x27;t have the burn of some mintier products which some may appreciate. I find that it feels gentle on my gums and does not hurt my sensitive teeth. However it feels quite grainy and I have to rinse pretty well to get that granulated feeling out of my mouth. I am not sure I would repurchase as I prefer something a little more refreshing and less grainy.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste tastes fine and it cleans my teeth pretty well, I don&#x27;t really have a problem with tooth sensitivity but it is also just plain good working toothpaste. So, it is not only good for people with tooth sensitivity, also the whole family.</li>
    <li> I will go back to using the regular pro-health; not exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is highly buzzword compliant. Perhaps that, combined with my being in the target market, is why I bought it in the first place. I haven&#x27;t been happy with the purchase. The most annoying problem is that the container leaks. The toothpaste is thinner than the pastes that I normally use and, apparently, is too thin for the flip-top tubes that Crest favors. The taste also seems off to me. It&#x27;s both sweeter and milder than I&#x27;d prefer. Finally, as others have mentioned, it&#x27;s a bit on the gritty side. I do wonder what that&#x27;s doing to my teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Pro-Health line of toothpaste. The 50+ version of the toothpaste is great, and I find it gentle for my teeth and gums. Minty but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> How does one review a toothpaste which claims to have long-term benefits such as preservation of enamel? Admittedly this is very hard unless one waited for years. So I&#x27;ll just consider short-term benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, how well does it clean? Well I can honestly say my teeth feel squeaky clean. Not all toothpaste I&#x27;ve used in the past gives you this clean a feel. But it is not unique to this brand as I have found a few other brands that imparted this squeaky clean feel. When I say squeaky clean, I mean when you run your tongue around your teeth you can feel how smooth and clean they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste? Very good minty taste. No complaints. It is perfectly pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it freshen breath? Well, my mouth and breath seem really fresh and clean after using so I&#x27;m sold on that part,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks, so cannot comment on how well it works for surface stains, or weak gums or enamel.  Did not notice any significant whitening though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this in the future? Definitely. The potential long-term benefits are promising and Crest is a company I can trust. I&#x27;ve used them for other products in the past (such as whitening strips) with very good results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and it has helped reduce the sensitivity of my teeth. The main difference between this Crest toothpaste for people over 50, and other Crest toothpaste varieties is the amount of sodium fluoride it contains, which is the only listed active ingredient on the two Crest toothpaste products I have. The sodium fluoride in my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; tube of Crest is 0.243%, while the amount in this \\&quot;over 50\\&quot; variety is almost double, 0.454%.</li>
    <li> I am the daughter of a dentist and I am very picky about what toothpaste I use. I have used Aquafresh for years, but it did not help with tooth sensitivity as I got older. I have been using Crest Pro Health for a little over six months. I have noticed that my teeth are whiter, and my sensitivity issue is pretty much gone. I have tried Sensodyne, but it does not freshen your breath like Crest Pro Health for Life does. My hygienist noticed a big improvement in the amount of tarter on my teeth. This is an excellent product! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I feel a cold twist in my gut, when I see brightly packaged stuff like this.  Bright colors in nature often mean toxic ingredients.  It doesn&#x27;t say the ingredients, which is scary.  Fluoride is a rat poison, and it has negative effects even in trace amounts.  Paying $5 for something that works maybe as well as baking soda doesn&#x27;t do much for me.  God alone knows what other toxins are in this.</li>
    <li> As someone else pointed out in a review here, this kind of thing is hard to \\&quot;truly\\&quot; review.  Because the claim of this specific kind of toothpaste is the kind that I can&#x27;t properly examine and spell out in a review here on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 47 when I write this, and while I&#x27;m not the target age, I&#x27;m close.  So I thought I&#x27;d take a look at this.  I figure it can&#x27;t HURT, right?  Some of the things it says it helps with are \\&quot;Tooth Sensitivity - Weak Enamel - Tender, Inflamed Gums - Surface Stains\\&quot;.  As I&#x27;m a lifetime coffee drinker, the stains issue piqued my interest.  Plus, I am getting older, so I figure the other issues could become&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for this review, how do you say \\&quot;OK, this toothpaste works better for inflamed gums and weak enamel\\&quot; over more &#x27;conventional&#x27; versions of toothpaste?  You really can&#x27;t.  I have to assume they&#x27;re not just lying about it being different, and there is SOME difference in that paste that helps address those things, and for that reason I was intersted in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste of things is a highly subjective issue, but for me, this didn&#x27;t taste like that typical taste toothpaste is like.  Given my age, I remember when all toothpastes were essentially the same - they all tasted awful.  This one isn&#x27;t like that.  It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to taste like a 5 star restaurant cooked dinner mind you - it is toothpaste (heh), but overall the taste was good, and not \\&quot;Oh man, I hate doing this, it tastes awful\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re over 50, and use Crest brand toothpastes already, this should be a no brainer.  Again, it&#x27;s hard to PROVE in a review like this that the addtl age related dental claims are met, but I have to assume they&#x27;re being helped by using this toothpaste, though.</li>
    <li> I have been a Crest customer for as long as I can remember- more recently I&#x27;ve been purchasing the Pro-Health, mint flavored, whitening tube. The Crest Pro-health For Life, Smooth Mint Flavor was given to me for review by Amazon. In short, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The gritty texture&lt;br /&gt;-If you leave the toothpaste on your toothbrush for more than a couple minutes, the toothpaste sort of melts into the bristles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Light Mint flavor!&lt;br /&gt;-Mouth feels fresh and clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this toothpaste for a couple weeks and there really isn&#x27;t anything about it that distinguishes it from other toothpastes that Crest makes. Maybe I just need to use it longer. Regardless, it is still a great toothpaste, especially for those 50+</li>
    <li> Some toothpastes (Colgate, for example) make my gums sting and itch (interestingly, same with my younger sister), and make me sneeze. This (and any of the Crest Pro Health line) doesn&#x27;t. Plus, this one&#x27;s often cheaper than the other Pro Health varieties, and given that the ingredients (and most of the labeling) is the same, I suspect that the only difference is the color, the flavor, and the amount of grit.</li>
    <li> Seems to do the job using our Sonicare toothbrushes - Dentist says our teeth &amp; gums look fine and says keep up the good effort</li>
    <li> I picked this up on a whim at the pharmacy shortly after a dental appointment. Wasn&#x27;t crazy about the taste, but I don&#x27;t like to waste, so I continued using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I had another cleaning, and things went a lot more quickly than usual. (I&#x27;ve always suffer from a lot of tartar buildup.) The dental assistant said, &amp;#34;You usually have a lot of buildup. Did you change brushing technique or toothpaste or something?&amp;#34; My first thought was this toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been brushing the same way for years, so pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty impressed. Anything that makes dental visits shorter gets five stars in my book!</li>
    <li> I do like this paste as it has a pleasant and not overpowering mint flavor.  The texture reminds me of a baking-powder toothpaste (although better tasting).  But for the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out why it&#x27;s for people over 50.  My 11yr old grandson is sharing the tube with us with no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t fall off the brush. (An issue with the grandson).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this toothpaste and will continue to buy it.  I&#x27;ll let you know if something amazing happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh...just for the record, I&#x27;ve used it on my partial and it works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;MEF</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a month now and I am very happy with it. It works, has a mild taste, and is plastic-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only in my 30&#x27;s but have very thin enamel on my teeth complete with microscopic fissures. My dentist advised me against using firm toothbrushes and heavy duty toothpastes (Crest Complete or Arm &amp; Hammer), so a few years ago, I switched to Crest Pro-Enamel with the pink label on the box. However, I just learned that the little blue specks in that toothpaste is NOT an advantageous oral chemical but PLASTIC. It&#x27;s the same little plastic &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; you find in hand soap and liquid body soap that is clogging up municipal water stations and entering our nation&#x27;s natural watersheds. I&#x27;ve flossed these blue bits from out of my gum line in the past and never though much of it until now. I just watched the news and saw where older adults are getting the plastic balls stuck in their gum lines. This is anti-hygiene because plastic harbors bacteria. Disgusting! I&#x27;m not older but I can&#x27;t afford plastic bits to enter my gum line or even my digestive tract. Plastic is poison in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I usually use Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste and because my husband has sensitivity, we decided to try Crest Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint Flavor Toothpaste. So far, it works very well for sensitivity and helps fight stains from the coffee I drink every day. If I had a complaint, it would be that if the paste stays on your tongue for too long, it feels slightly numb. Otherwise, I love this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Surprising my parents for whom this toothpaste was targeted, did not like the texture of the toothpaste.  I did not want to waste it so it became my work place toothpaste.  The product has a light, natural paste that is slightly gritty, it has the same texture as organic based toothpaste with a very baking soda feel.  I really loved this product, paste is light and the gritty feel helps polish my teeth.  I still get the same clean feel in my mouth as my other thick whitening toothpaste.  My gums look and feel fine and it does not make my teeth sensitive.  This review may change after I see my dentist since it claims to prevent enamel wear, but all in all I would recommend the use of this toothpaste.  I even bought two more tubes.</li>
