### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great buy!</li>
      <li>The reason I continue to use this (and gave it three stars) is that it feels wonderful on your skin.</li>
      <li>In contrast, the Clinique and Aveeno products are perfect substitutes for foundation.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is perfect.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great!  </li>
      <li>Great time saver.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced break-outs because of the cream, though.  </li>
      <li>This is great BB cream.</li>
      <li>A great product I will definately buy again.</li>
      <li>lol,</li>
      <li>I have taken really good care of my skin</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t think of a good reason why.</li>
      <li>It gives good coverage and does not feel greasy or oily.</li>
      <li>Fresh feeling &amp; smelling, leaves a wonderful</li>
      <li>Very refreshing BB cream,I&#x27;ve Olay, and</li>
      <li>you need NO foundation coverage and are just looking for a nice lightweight moisturizer with sun protection to use on your face day to day, this may be a good option.  </li>
      <li>A nice formula for a good price.</li>
      <li>light coverage, spf, beautiful</li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d paid more attention to the comments on here about this product&#x27;s lack of coverage!</li>
      <li>The Olay BB cream fair to light seemed a good match.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice</li>
      <li>I have not ever tried this before, Olay has nice skin care products.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hide my age spots, but it blends my skin tone nicely.</li>
      <li>So I can honestly say that I have imperfect skin that needs help to look</li>
      <li>I keep catching whiffs of it</li>
      <li>If you are over 40 and your looking for an on the go light tint coverage, this is a good product to try.</li>
      <li>and (more of a problem for me) smelled like a cheaper plumeria scent (kind of like the Wal-mart version of plumeria body spray that they tend to bring out in gift packages around Christmas).  </li>
      <li>Now that that is out of the way, I was shopping around for a good, light spf makeup because I like for my skin to show through.</li>
      <li>I really like this one its lite and makes your skin feel real nice too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very light</li>
      <li>I use concealer over it, and so that works OK.</li>
      <li>I just liked the sound of the claims on the packaging.</li>
      <li>I love Olay products and they didn&#x27;t have this one in my country</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>But keep in mind there are much better choices out there.</li>
      <li>I gave it away, hoping it will work better on someone else.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it&#x27;s not drying like many of its peers</li>
      <li>However, I like to use a powder foundation or a pressed powder on top of it</li>
      <li>Works for senior citizen me with a more carefree lifestyle.</li>
      <li>I have never been able to wear a moisturizer with spf because most make me sooo greasy that it is unbearable.</li>
      <li>I have yet to use it instead of my moisturizer, which may be the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Because I already use and love Olay moisturizer, I will continue to use this BB cream until it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
      <li>For someone with drier skin or someone looking for a sunscreen, it might work better.  </li>
      <li>I love this item.</li>
      <li>I love the smell in my opinion.</li>
      <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try Olay BB cream in Fair to Light to have another option.  </li>
      <li>This is something I didn&#x27;t know even existed I love it, its like a light moisturizing makeup.</li>
      <li>Be sure to apply lightly..</li>
      <li>I got this because so many people said that it was light and didn&#x27;t feel like they were wearing anything.  </li>
      <li>It squeezes out easily and doesn&#x27;t pour out.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong but it does eventually go away and,</li>
      <li>I know everyone has been talking about the scent being strong</li>
      <li>I even like the very light, fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>Light foundation-like  coverage, moisturizer  and sun protection in one product.</li>
      <li>It does work like a light foundation.</li>
      <li>I also really enjoy the smell.</li>
      <li>It felt light but within hours (before noon)</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something light than this is it.</li>
      <li>The scent is great, unlike many other BB creams.</li>
      <li>When I feel confident in my skin or want to give my skin more of a \\&quot;breather\\&quot; day I wear it alone; many days I layer Revlon Total Effects Foundation for Oily/Combo skin over it or just touch up discolorations with MAC studio fix foundation/powder in NW15 -- it just depends on what my skin and the climate are doing that</li>
      <li>This is exactly like a tinted moisturizer, and I know some may argue that most BB creams DON&#x27;T have coverage</li>
      <li>Maybe after a couple months, I will see significant changes in the texture or appearance of my skin.  </li>
      <li>But I decided to test out this Olay BB cream alone to see if it might live up to its own packaging hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried this as I was hoping for a true BB cream.</li>
      <li>, that may actually work better for me).&lt;br /&gt;There is a very strong, perfume-y scent which is a little overwhelming at first, but I got used to it quickly, and it no longer bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;I have been attempting to get away from foundation, and thought this would be a great 1-step solution.  </li>
      <li>I use this daily with only a light dusting of powder on top and have noticed great results.</li>
      <li>But I suspect that would take away from its other qualities that I&#x27;m so happy with.</li>
      <li>The coverage is mild.</li>
      <li>This is the only one I have purchased more than one time, because it is ao much better than the others I have tried.</li>
      <li>I rarely breakout.  </li>
      <li>so I thought it was a worth</li>
      <li>but overall it&#x27;s a nice bb cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m someone who prefers a more natural look</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no comparison between those and Olay&#x27;s Fresh Effects Bb Cream.  </li>
      <li>It looks very foundation-like coming out of the tube but blends very very well very quickly.</li>
      <li>However in fairness this may be the right cream for someone else.  </li>
      <li>BB creams are all the rage right now, and when Olay came out with one, I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  </li>
      <li>Correcting UV Moisturizer in Fair to Light almost every day for the past 3 years.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I recommend this if you&#x27;re new to BB creams and want to try something light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it is a good moisturizer it wears off in less than an hour.</li>
      <li>First of all I am Troys wife-</li>
      <li>My skin is clear, smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, and evenly toned!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They also have a higher SPF than Olay&#x27;s &amp;#34;Bb cream&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Great coverage with SPF and not as thick and pasty like foundation.</li>
      <li>Using this technique, it actually gave OK coverage to even out the redness around my nose.  </li>
      <li>but it would never be my first choice because there are certainly better facial lotions out there.</li>
      <li>But it does exactly what is says..</li>
      <li>At first it even seemed to mattify my forehead.  </li>
      <li>I love the BB cream because it applies easily and does not feel heavy on my skin.</li>
      <li>While it might not do anything else it claims to do, it really does leave your face feeling smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>The only BB cream I could find that didn&#x27;t look too yellow on fair skin.</li>
      <li>Olay BB cream got a lot of good reviews on several different sites but after I got it home, I couldn&#x27;t figure out why!</li>
      <li>the positive side, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;smothered&amp;#34; the way it sometimes does when I wear moisturizer in the summer, and it does feel well hydrated.  </li>
      <li>pretty much everything).  </li>
      <li>, I like the packaging and bottle shape/size (whatever sits on my counter must look pretty too), and because most of the other products from this line are ones I&#x27;d repurchase.</li>
      <li>First up, I have normal skin that doesn&#x27;t break out a lot.</li>
      <li>I really like using this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, especially considering there is sunscreen in it.  </li>
      <li>It smells sort of like a mix between Jergens lotion and baby powder, with notes of bug spray-- very chemical and cloying.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it now.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First up, I have normal skin that doesn&#x27;t break out a lot. The color matches me well enough, though I know some reviewers have had problems with it looking too dark. I&#x27;m pretty darn pale, and have no problems on that front.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ordinarily wear makeup on my skin, and ordered this product mainly out of curiosity. Some people have said that this is definitely not a BB cream - I can&#x27;t speak to that, as I&#x27;ve never tried a \\&quot;real\\&quot; one. I just liked the sound of the claims on the packaging. When I tried it, I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance. It gave a little shine (just as moisturizer does - nothing too scary) and did not much else. I&#x27;ve used it again over a couple blemishes and found that it gives *no* coverage at all. Much less than even an Olay tinted moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried in the past. If you&#x27;re looking for something that will \\&quot;hide imperfections and [minimize] the need for concealer and foundation\\&quot; - as this product claims to - look somewhere else. I definitely needed to use concealer over it. The reason I continue to use this (and gave it three stars) is that it feels wonderful on your skin. While it might not do anything else it claims to do, it really does leave your face feeling smooth and soft to the touch. All in all, I&#x27;m not throwing it out, but it does nothing that your average lotion can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT INSTEAD OF MAKE UP.  I LIKE IT A LOT.  I UAW IT IN THE MORNING AND REAPPLY A FEW TIMES A DAY AS IT IS ALSO A SUN PROTECTION.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, oily and dry skin that&#x27;s acne prone.  This BB cream was a giant fail for me.  It offered next to no coverage, and it made my face look like an oil slick.  For someone with drier skin or someone looking for a sunscreen, it might work better.  I&#x27;m normally a fan of Olay products, but this was not good at all.</li>
    <li> Matches my skin perfectly, love the subtle fresh scent and creamy texture. I will definitely be purchasing this again! Only real con I have is that I have sort of oily skin to begin with, so by the end of the day I&#x27;m a bit shiny from the extra moisture this product provides. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I like my tinted moisturiser to be a little thicker than your average lotion.  This stuff is perfect.</li>
    <li> Just go buy a Korean BB cream.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed that the product had a discount sale tag on the box. Expected new product and not one that was possibly being sold as close to or out of date.</li>
    <li> I started using this product this summer after I realized that I wanted to simplify my morning routine.  Although I broke out a little at first (Common for when I try a new product), I really do enjoy using this product!  It&#x27;s light, especially considering there is sunscreen in it.  The tint is VERY slight, but it helps even out some of the redness and I even have to use less concealer under my eyes.  I even like the very light, fresh scent.  If you&#x27;re looking to try BB cream and don&#x27;t want to spend out the ears for it, I highly recommend this one!</li>
    <li> My skin is normal to oily with dryness around my nose.  I rarely breakout.  My usual skin routine is to use something to even out the redness around my nose and to cut the shine on my forehead and nose.  I actually do have a go-to BB cream (Missha) which can even out redness and stop shine.  But I decided to test out this Olay BB cream alone to see if it might live up to its own packaging hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: no, this did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NC20-NC25 skin tone.  The Olay BB cream fair to light seemed a good match.  It is...err...skin colored.  sorry!  I mean, it is neither too pink, too orange or too gray.  It is a thin consistency that seems to get on everything you touch so I applied using a damp sponge.  Using this technique, it actually gave OK coverage to even out the redness around my nose.  At first it even seemed to mattify my forehead.  It felt light but within hours (before noon) my face looked greasy and it even appeared i was a shade darker than usual!  I can&#x27;t stand moisturizers that feel heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream is also heavily perfumed.  My eyes were tearing as I applied it and i had to redo my mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was no good for me.  However in fairness this may be the right cream for someone else.  I&#x27;d suggest trying to obtain a small sample first before you buy the entire product.  But keep in mind there are much better choices out there.</li>
    <li> I was at my local supermarket when I noticed this was being discontinued--it was cheaper for this reason so I thought it was a worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream before, so that&#x27;s the only thing I can compare it to. Maybelline definitely has more coverage and covers up blemishes very well, but I overall prefer Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream. I&#x27;m someone who prefers a more natural look and I want my freckles to be shown. This BB cream does that. It evens out my tone and makes my skin feel a lot softer and hydrated. It&#x27;s also very light and I can&#x27;t feel it after it&#x27;s been applied! I also really enjoy the smell. It smells similar to Garnier Fructis products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream also doesn&#x27;t leave a cakey look. However, I like to use a powder foundation or a pressed powder on top of it because over time, it gives my face an oily appearance if I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this if you&#x27;re new to BB creams and want to try something light.</li>
    <li> First of all I am Troys wife-I am not a guy! Now that that is out of the way, I was shopping around for a good, light spf makeup because I like for my skin to show through. Women who wear too much makeup or if it is too dark just end up looking older and I am 38. I have taken really good care of my skin so I look a lot younger than I am but I still don&#x27;t want a thick cakey makeup. Olay BB cream got a lot of good reviews on several different sites but after I got it home, I couldn&#x27;t figure out why! It smells nice but it provides NO coverage as far as I could see and it has a sandy texture like it had bits of something in it. This is not good for me as I have sensitive skin. Maybe I just got a bad batch, I know that happens but I wouldn&#x27;t tell anyone to buy this. I will keep looking til I find one I like.</li>
    <li> Light, fresh cream with a slight tint.  Not too dark, heavy, or over powering.  Plenty of sunscreen for upcoming springtime sunshine. A nice formula for a good price.</li>
    <li> This is great BB cream. Light foundation-like  coverage, moisturizer  and sun protection in one product. The scent is great, unlike many other BB creams. This is the only one I have purchased more than one time, because it is ao much better than the others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love this item. Great coverage with SPF and not as thick and pasty like foundation. Only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is because I received the item squished and short dated...bought item in June and expires in October.</li>
    <li> I love the BB cream because it applies easily and does not feel heavy on my skin. I gave it a four star rating only because I would like a BB cream that I do not have to apply every 3 hours. If you are over 40 and your looking for an on the go light tint coverage, this is a good product to try. I like to wear mine when I exercise because a bare face looks blah and regular foundation is too heavy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m pale as pale can be! This tone works.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this one because I can&#x27;t find the color in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wondering why it didn&#x27;t come in a box. I can&#x27;t think of a good reason why.</li>
    <li> This will be my new moisturizer.  It goes on non-greasy and the tint smooths out the skin tone.  Also, this does not clog my pores.  Can&#x27;t say enough about it.  I have stopped using foundation daily and only use &amp;#34;make-up foundation&amp;#34; for special occasions.  Great time saver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a late 20s mom with bad skin.  I am fairly pale skinned but have lots of redness and large pores. I&#x27;ve been using this bb cream for about two weeks now. This stuff works great!  It looks very foundation-like coming out of the tube but blends very very well very quickly. My skin is smoother than ever and my pores appear smaller. It does not feel heavy or greasy throughout the day. I have never been able to wear a moisturizer with spf because most make me sooo greasy that it is unbearable. Not this!! Be sure to apply lightly..it goes further than you think its going to. It evens out my skin very well for everyday purposes(I still wear foundation if I have a date with my husband or just want to look extra special). I use this daily with only a light dusting of powder on top and have noticed great results. My skin is clear, smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, and evenly toned!&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because it could stand to have a little more coverage.  But I suspect that would take away from its other qualities that I&#x27;m so happy with. Its not a foundation..don&#x27;t expect it to cover like one. But it does exactly what is says..light coverage, spf, beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I have not noticed any overpowering scents that others have mentioned. It has a light sunscreen-esque scent for the first few minutes but that quickly disipates.</li>
    <li> I have not ever tried this before, Olay has nice skin care products. I really like this one its lite and makes your skin feel real nice too.</li>
    <li> I got this because so many people said that it was light and didn&#x27;t feel like they were wearing anything.  Well.. coming from someone who never wears makeup on their face: I definitely feel like I&#x27;m wearing something.  I wanted to try out this make up world, but this stuff makes my face feel greasy.  So maybe for someone who is used to caking on the makeup, this product might feel light, but that term is very much a relative term to what you&#x27;re used to.  it IS spf 15 though - so since I hate wasting things, I actually just use this as my face sunblock when i go lay out at the pool.  It definitely works as a sunblock</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d paid more attention to the comments on here about this product&#x27;s lack of coverage! Instead, I was lured in by the number of stars people have given it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a possible substitute for tinted moisturizers I usually use, Clinque&#x27;s Moisture Surge and Aveeno&#x27;s Positively Radiant Tinted Moisturizer.  There&#x27;s no comparison between those and Olay&#x27;s Fresh Effects Bb Cream.  If Olay didn&#x27;t label this as a tinted moisturizer, I&#x27;d have no idea that&#x27;s what it was supposed to be.  This product doesn&#x27;t provide any coverage or do anything to even out my complexion.  In contrast, the Clinique and Aveeno products are perfect substitutes for foundation.  They also have a higher SPF than Olay&#x27;s &amp;#34;Bb cream&amp;#34; does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is also annoying.  It&#x27;s stronger than what I&#x27;d expect from a facial moisturizer, and the scent is not particularly pleasant.  It smells sort of like a mix between Jergens lotion and baby powder, with notes of bug spray-- very chemical and cloying.  I keep catching whiffs of it and it&#x27;s making me want to wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;smothered&amp;#34; the way it sometimes does when I wear moisturizer in the summer, and it does feel well hydrated.  I guess if I needed a plain, non-tinted moisturizer this would be okay, but it would never be my first choice because there are certainly better facial lotions out there.</li>
    <li> Felt like trying it and seeing what it is all about. It goes on smoothly and I don&#x27;t use too much. It squeezes out easily and doesn&#x27;t pour out. Never had a problem with the product leaking out on the counter with the lid off. My daughter thinks I got a good deal as she expected the tube I received to be a lot smaller than what I got. I do need to use a little maybellines green stick underneath or my redness comes through, I do like to top it off with a little powder. My daughter says the olay bb cream is lightweight and soft. Would consider purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Covergirl tinted moisturizer and decided to give Olay a try.  Olay feels a little oiler so I&#x27;ll save it for cooler weather when my over-50 skin gets dry.</li>
    <li> I used this for one month and the only change I noticed was that my skin started breaking out.  Once I stopped using it my skin cleared up again.  Initially I had high hopes but it was just not meant to be (for my skin.)</li>
    <li> Very refreshing BB cream,I&#x27;ve Olay, and this is no exception. Fresh feeling &amp; smelling, leaves a wonderful she&#x27;s on the skin...and I&#x27;m 51! Just don&#x27;t get in the eyes...irritates a bit.</li>
    <li> I really like using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and have used Olay products for years.  My mom, aunt and grandmother also used them, starting with my grandmother&#x27;s loyalty to the original yellowish \\&quot;Oil of Olay\\&quot; in the square bottle that I remember.  My aunt and grandmother have/had fabulous skin, my mom will tell you that she neglected her face routine for 20 years and is now bearing the consequences, and I have problem skin that has had three serious bouts with cystic acne (I&#x27;ve suffered through Accutane, injections, steriods, antibiotics, Retin-A, Clindamycine and Benzoyl Peroxide, Spironoactone...pretty much everything).  So I can honestly say that I have imperfect skin that needs help to look its best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Olay for their moisturizer.  I have combination skin and keep Olay in my makeup arsenal for those days when I&#x27;m in a dryer, colder climate or my skin just needs a little more moisture.  I&#x27;ve used Oil of Olay Total Effects Tone Correcting UV Moisturizer in Fair to Light almost every day for the past 3 years.  When I feel confident in my skin or want to give my skin more of a \\&quot;breather\\&quot; day I wear it alone; many days I layer Revlon Total Effects Foundation for Oily/Combo skin over it or just touch up discolorations with MAC studio fix foundation/powder in NW15 -- it just depends on what my skin and the climate are doing that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try Olay BB cream in Fair to Light to have another option.  I was disappointed.  The product was EXTREMELY sheer and (more of a problem for me) smelled like a cheaper plumeria scent (kind of like the Wal-mart version of plumeria body spray that they tend to bring out in gift packages around Christmas).  I&#x27;m sensitive to smells in makeup and cleaning products, so this is a no-go for me.  I can layer other makeup options over the Olay BB cream, but I can&#x27;t get rid of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need NO foundation coverage and are just looking for a nice lightweight moisturizer with sun protection to use on your face day to day, this may be a good option.  If you&#x27;re looking for any sort of skin correcting coverage and/or are sensitive to smells in any way, I&#x27;d look for other options.</li>
    <li> I like the light-weight feel of this product with its minimal protection benefit. Works for senior citizen me with a more carefree lifestyle.</li>
    <li> It makes my makeup and skin look better, And I notice it made my pores a little smaller. The only reason I gave it four stars is because my face got a tiny bit irritated the first couple days, and the expiration date was for April 2014. It&#x27;s October 2014 lol, but overall it&#x27;s a nice bb cream.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products and they didn&#x27;t have this one in my country yet so I was keen to purchase on Amazon. I bought it in 2 shades so I could wear through winter and summer. It gives good coverage and does not feel greasy or oily. Stays put for hours too. A great product I will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> The only BB cream I could find that didn&#x27;t look too yellow on fair skin. You get a LOT of product. One lasts me nearly half a year. Doesn&#x27;t have a lot of coverage, but works as a primer and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I feel that the moisturizer makes my face feel greasy and just not a good feeling to have. I gave it away, hoping it will work better on someone else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it is a good moisturizer it wears off in less than an hour. The tint is almost nonexistent afterwards and I think it may be causing break outs. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it&#x27;s not drying like many of its peers, I like the packaging and bottle shape/size (whatever sits on my counter must look pretty too), and because most of the other products from this line are ones I&#x27;d repurchase. Otherwise, it&#x27;d give one star.</li>
    <li> This is something I didn&#x27;t know even existed I love it, its like a light moisturizing makeup.I def recommend it.</li>
    <li> BB creams are all the rage right now, and when Olay came out with one, I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  But, I have to admit, I don&#x27;t really get the purpose of this product.  I think my skin looks a little more dewy, but this cream gives zero coverage.  I still have to apply liquid foundation to my problem areas.  I am of Irish descent and pale, but the Fair to Light seems a little too light for me (I read another review for Light to Medium, which said it was quite pink, that may actually work better for me).&lt;br /&gt;There is a very strong, perfume-y scent which is a little overwhelming at first, but I got used to it quickly, and it no longer bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;I have been attempting to get away from foundation, and thought this would be a great 1-step solution.  I have yet to use it instead of my moisturizer, which may be the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Because I already use and love Olay moisturizer, I will continue to use this BB cream until it&#x27;s gone.  Maybe after a couple months, I will see significant changes in the texture or appearance of my skin.  ****Update: I stopped using this product shortly after writing this review, I was completely dissatified with all aspects of this product.  I gave it away.****  I was hoping to take it on a trip, instead of taking separate moisturizer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I apologize if this review does not help you to decide whether you should try this product for yourself, but I can&#x27;t really say anything too positive or too negative about the product.</li>
    <li> I tried this as I was hoping for a true BB cream. It was thick, it has a fragrance and I felt like I had thick sunscreen on my face all day. Would not recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I know everyone has been talking about the scent being strong but it goes away within 10 minutes! I love the smell in my opinion. It covers all my redness and makes my skin completely even but I still look natural because my freckles show through!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After having this for a little while I&#x27;ve come to realize that this have no coverage. This is exactly like a tinted moisturizer, and I know some may argue that most BB creams DON&#x27;T have coverage but if you compare to Garnier it&#x27;s a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really what it comes down to is what YOU are looking for. This BB cream doesn&#x27;t have a lot of coverage but it \\&quot;neutralizes\\&quot; redness I guess. It is a little runny, and very sheer. The smell is strong but it does eventually go away and, yes, it does \\&quot;sting\\&quot; a little bit. If you&#x27;re looking for something light than this is it.</li>
    <li> I picked up a tube of this at Big Lots &amp; decided to try it because it was super cheap, Olay, and I was curious about BB cream, which I&#x27;d never tried. It does work like a light foundation. It doesn&#x27;t hide my age spots, but it blends my skin tone nicely. I use concealer over it, and so that works OK. I don&#x27;t much care for the slightly tacky feeling that it leaves on my skin after application--a tackiness that lasts quite a while. I&#x27;m more aware than I want to be that I have something on my face, and that&#x27;s not a good feeling in the summer. I haven&#x27;t experienced break-outs because of the cream, though.  Update 2/2016: I&#x27;ve been using this all winter and I really like it now. Maybe the composition of the cream isn&#x27;t good for humid summers, but for dry, cold winters, it has been a boon. The coverage is mild. I use a CC cream on the age spots after I put this on. Works very well. I&#x27;ll miss it when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
