<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this dryer as a promotion for review and evaluation and I really like it! I have long, thin, fine, straight hair and I find it best to use the warm setting. I really like the concentration connector tool as well, it helped to get a nice smooth look. It connects easily and stays put for me. I love that the dryer is so lightweight because I usually dry my little ones hair first then mine so I&#x27;m holding this for quite a while. It is lighter an more efficient than the hair dryer I was using so I am happy. I have had no issues with this and will update my review if I do.</li>
    <li> very happy and really impressed with my new xtava iconic hair dryer! i have curly hair that is difficult to straighten and that is ok! with this hair dryer and the diffuser i am able to achieve beautiful curly hair that is soft and bouncy with no frizzies. i love how it has different setting from no heat to hot and low air to a lot, so i have the options i need and want for achieving any hair style i want! today i decided i wanted my hair to look sleeker and was totally able to do so with the directed tool and a round brush! i have loved giving you all my review and opinions in exchange of complementary product.</li>
    <li> Overall I like this hair dryer.  It does dry hair faster and with less frizz.  I luv being able to keep the cool air on instead of having to hold a cool shot button down (like my OLD hair dryer).  Cord is nice and flexible, not too long or too short.  Noise level is average.  My only complaint, and reason for giving it 4/5 stars is the buttons.  I can&#x27;t seem to keep them straight (power level vs. heat level) and I tend to accidently turn it off if it&#x27;s on low speed.  I think it&#x27;s just a placement issue.  Maybe an updated version with different buttons will help make it a 5/5 star product.  Hope it lasts as long as my last blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that a friend passed this one along for my wife to try. My wife states that this hair dryer is nothing short of amazing. The diffuser is huge, 5 inches wide huge! That is awesome for all the hair she has. It usually takes forever to dry normally but with this hair dryer, it takes no time flat. The diffuser allows for a greater distribution of air and therefore an easier time to dry. This hair dryer looks amazing just hanging out in our bathroom and is sleek and stylish &amp; does two jobs in one so I get more counter space instead of more hair styling products on the counter--BONUS!! My wife &amp; I love this company and this product.</li>
    <li> Seems like a lot of review of this product are coming from people receiving xtava&#x27;s product for free and write reviews after they use it.  But one thing I&#x27;m not sure why they named this hair dryer &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; and no where in the user manual or the box mention &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m returning it. Update(May, 2017) :Turn out I kept the dryer.  I&#x27;m using it even up till now, no complaint.  But not sure what is the differences if it does contain ionic.  Hope the manufacturer can respond to this comment.</li>
    <li> Great design and love the color!&lt;br /&gt;It is light, which is nice. It is easy to handle. It does seem a bit less powerful when the high button is pressed, hence the 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;What is nice is that it is tough to press the cold button by mistake. You really need to want that setting . Often I have found with hairdryers that the cold will cold on by accident simply when holding and drying; not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two attachments; a diffuser and a targeted air pointer for more direct drying. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product; recommending based on quality and construction.</li>
    <li> This is excellent.  I&#x27;m already in love.  Less than half the time to dry my hair.  I&#x27;ve got super thick and long hair and it usually takes me 15 minutes to get it partly dry with a standard hair dryer.  With the Xtava, it took me about four minutes.  Do you know how much time I saved?  I tend not to blowdry because it takes too long. Now, I don&#x27;t have to worry plus my hair has more volume and shine than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little heavier than what I am used to, but not uncomfortable.  It comes with the standard attachments for brush drying and curls.  Honestly, though I&#x27;ll probably not need either of them.  Four minutes and my hair was dry and cooled?  I can&#x27;t believe it.  The power definitely helps as it&#x27;s stronger on high and hot.  No problems or hint of getting my hair caught.  There&#x27;s certainly no way I&#x27;d go back to some other model.  I&#x27;m still a bit shocked it took such a short time to dry all of my hair.</li>
    <li> First of all, this blow dryer is extremely light.  Surprisingly light even. If you have long hair (or a lot of it), that is something you will surely appreciate.  It also has a very powerful motor so that you can get the job done in no time at all.  If you are like me at all you need to get your hair dry as fast as possible in the morning so you can get on with your day.  And not &#x27;frizzy&#x27; dry as many blow dryers are good at accomplishing....but sleek and sexy dry.  The diffuser nozzle of this product makes that possible for me.  It stays on securely while drying my hair and diffuses the air just enough that my hair no longer &#x27;frizzies&#x27; up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips on using the diffuser:&lt;br /&gt;1: apply your choice of hair products&lt;br /&gt;2: allow your hair to dry 75% before using the diffuser (if you are in a rush, use regular blow dryer first without nozzle)&lt;br /&gt;3: use clips if you want to add volume at the crown of your head&lt;br /&gt;4: if you have time, use the cool setting to dry your hair with the diffuser.  If not enough time, use medium to ensure your hair will not frizz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am truly honored that I was offered the opportunity to review this product at no cost to me.  Every once in a while you just know you have a winner on your hands, and this is such a product.  Stylish, effective, fun and extremely light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*product received free or at a discount in exchange for my review</li>
    <li> I have thick and course hair and it takes like an hour or so to dry my hair and with this dryer it takes 10-15 minutes. So glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but the difusser does not fit on the dryer so I&#x27;m not sure how I can use it.</li>
    <li> I have naturally frizzy, curly hair. It&#x27;s been the bane of my existence for pretty much my whole life. I&#x27;ve had my hair chemically straightened countless times by numerous hair stylists and eventually decided to quit fighting with my hair. It&#x27;s just going to do what it wants to do. So when I got the opportunity to try out a hair dryer with ionic technology AND a diffuser, I jumped at the chance. This hair dryer has it all - it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to handle, it&#x27;s got the easy-to-snap-on diffuser and concentrator nozzle attachments, and variable settings for heat, speed, and cool blast to adjust to whatever you&#x27;re trying to do to your hair. So I washed my hair, put some anti-frizz serum and argan oil in, and let the dryer do its magic. I used the diffuser and got the awesome results I wanted - tight ringlets with minimal frizz. I was so happy. If you&#x27;ve never struggled with your hair every day, you don&#x27;t understand how great it is to find a product that works for you. This versatile dryer is going to be in my bag of tricks for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Beautiful blow dryer! Came with a few attachments, I have straight hair, so I have not figured out what I can use them for yet, but I am excited to try some new things with them. The air is quick to get hot, and the blow dryer is a convenient size, its not little, but its not so bulky that it is too hard to take with you while traveling, plus it is really pretty, so that is awesome too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair and with it being cold in the morning I like to have my hair dry before leaving the house but my old blow dryer always took me a long time to dry my hair. So when I got a chance to try out Xtava&#x27;s Rimini hair dryer I couldn&#x27;t have been happier. It has been a lifesaver! Not only does it dry my hair fast the included diffuser helps make it even faster. The hair dryer itself is very light weight and has a nice sleek feel to it. It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and use. The diffusers go on and off without any struggle. I love that there is different switches one for cool air. Then you have a heater switch that has 3 temperatures low, medium, and high. Then there is the speed switch for how much air is blown which has a gentle and strong setting along with an off switch. I like that they are actual buttons that you press to the right or left depending which setting you want. My old hair dryer had a slide button up for strong down for light and I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have slid the button accidentally while trying to do my hair. So Xtava definitely got it right with their design I have not had one problem yet. My favorite part of all is that my hair is left feeling soft and silky and not frizzy and dry.</li>
    <li> WHOA! so when the instructions said it &#x27;reduced drying time&#x27;, they were not lying! This hair dryer is AMAZING and it has a lot of heat. I received this complimentary hair dryer for testing and reviewing purposes; so here is what I experience with this hair dryer. I have long thick hair and this bad boy right here does the job of drying my hair QUICKLY and I love the fact that it is not even loud in comparison to the hair dryers that I have owned before. It has three different heating levels and this is the cool part, it also has a COOL button which I prefer to use after I dry my hair. This is my first time using a diffuser and I&#x27;m really taking advantage of it; my hair is wavy and this brings out my curls! I am very happy I got this hair dryer. I also love the blue color. It is very lightweight and if you have long thick hair, you already know the struggle (at least for me) of drying your hair and having to rest your arm because it gets tired lol I don&#x27;t even have that problem with this hair dryer since it&#x27;s VERY LIGHT! Overall, I am impressed and satisfied with my hair dryer and I truly recommend it. It is totally worth to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of a new blow dryer but very hesitant to purchase because I have attempted twice over the years to get a new, updated one but both broke quickly and didn’t work as good as my 15 year old blow dryer. The Xtava Rimini 1500W Ionic Hair Dryer really surprised me. I mean, really. First, it is insanely lightweight (I think they say “ultra-lightweight”). There are 3 heat levels and 2 power levels and it comes with two attachments - a diffuser to help eliminate frizz and give more volume and a Concentrator Nozzle for focusing on just one area of your hair to dry that area more rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for how it performed - I have long, wavy, medium-thickness hair (and lots of it) that tends to get frizzy with heat products (so I limit them!) I generally spend 35-40 minutes to get this hair dried with a blow dryer. This, combined with the fact that I was in a bad car accident and it can get really painful when I am styling my hair for so long means I throw mousse in and let it air-dry wavy/curly more often than not. NOT ANYMORE. I LOVE this hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took only 20 minutes to completely dry my hair with the diffuser. And, my hair looked FABULOUS. It made my hair so smooth and soft and with no frizz!!! I didn’t need to use extra smoothing lotions or serums like I usually do! The cool shot button helps to “set” the style and it also helps reduce frizz and boost shine (my old one didn’t have one of these!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this enough! I wish Amazon wasn’t out of stock so I could purchase one for my sister. She’s always replacing hair dryers too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.*</li>
    <li> **Pros**&lt;br /&gt;Multiple Settings&lt;br /&gt;Different nozzles&lt;br /&gt;Quick drying&lt;br /&gt;Frizz-free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Cons**&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am drooling over this hairdryer!!! I have had Conair hairdryers all of my life and I will never, ever, ever go back to them. This Xtava hairdryer is wonderful. I have super long, THICK, coarse hair. My hair is so thick and coarse, the last time I had my hair cut I dulled the hair stylists scissors. It takes forever to dry my hair with the Conair hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought this bad boy out of the box, snapped a picture of my before hair and then jumped in the shower. I have a slight wave to my hair, it&#x27;s not really wavy, but it could be if I styled it, but ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that. After my shower I put my hair up in a t-shirt to keep the frizz to a minimum and to get it out of my face so I could do my makeup real quick. When I finished my makeup I started on my hair using the diffuser. And. Oh. My. Gosh. It took me 10 maybe 15 minutes to dry my hair (my son interrupted). I kept it on low flow and high heat and wowza it was quick and it made my hair look ten times better than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still in shock over how nice my hair looks by just using a hairdryer! I even sent my husband the picture to show him and his text back was, &amp;#34;Oooohhh!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did check out the other settings. I&#x27;m quite partial to the cool dry setting so I wanted to see how well that worked! Every setting was awesome! I love that you can control how much heat with three different settings along with the normal air power settings in a light ant and heavy. I&#x27;m hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an HONEST opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair dryer I really like the color to it. It looks fabulous. The hair dryer it self is light weight. I like to use it without the attachment because usually it works faster than with it but that is just because I have long hair that has tangling issues. The hair dryer gets hot enough to dry your hair fast and it will look great. It has a nice long cord to it that doesn&#x27;t get tangled up either. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hair dryer. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s horrible, but it&#x27;s not spectacular, not like some of the other Xtava products I have used in the past. It doesn&#x27;t look it, but it is lightweight and it&#x27;s a really nice color blue. It comes with two attachments; a big customized diffuser and a concentrated nozzle for targeting styling. The diffuser was a little difficult to get on. It didn&#x27;t fit as good as the concentrated nozzle. I also liked that it has a long cord which made it easier for me to move around when needed. This Rimini hair dryer comes with three heat levels, two power levels and a cool shot button to set your style. The different settings and attachments did make it easier when styling my hair. I could set them to what ever I needed them to be, when I needed them. I&#x27;ve never uses such a big diffuser like this before. It did dry my hair quickly, but I have very fine hair, so I don&#x27;t need a lot of heat. It did help with the frizz and left my hair feeling smooth. I felt that it could have had a bit more power to it, but it was okay. For people with thicker hair, it might take a little longer to dry. Overall, this hair dryer was not bad, it does what a hair dryer is suppose to do and gets the job done. It&#x27;s very easy to use and with all the different settings and attachments, it&#x27;s convenient too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.

Regardless, I will only recommend products or services I use personally and/or believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> pricey but excellent dryer. I like quality items.</li>
    <li> Nice product, but never got the diffuser it was supposed to come with.</li>
    <li> Very nice. I love the different heat settings and the noise level is really low compared to my old Conair hair dryer</li>
    <li> The Iconic hair dryer is great, I have really thick blonde hair and it always gets really frizzy when I go outside. It seems as if humidity hates my hair. But thanks to this hair dryer I have a solution. I love how it has three heating options depending on your hair type. An added feature that I thought was really cool was a piece that goes over the head end of the dryer, this is meant for not letting your hair get caught up inside. It also has a diffuser which is great. I love how easy it makes my morning routines, after I take a shower I plug the dryer in and my hair is done in 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention it makes me hair looking absolutely stunning. My daughter uses it too and she loves it. I love this product and I&#x27;m really glad I was given the opportunity to try it. Something I thought was really cool with the fact that they give you a 50% off discount coupon for your next purchase in the box.&lt;br /&gt; I was sent these for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
    <li> Ok ok I am a hair dryer convert now thanks to this one!  I have super curly hair (spiral curls through the back and semi-tight on the rest) and just find that hairdryers cause me to have lots of frizz even with a diffuser.  I had just gotten another hairdryer for my girls (who have beautiful straight, thick hair!) and my mom was saying how much she liked that one and needed a new one (it is also Xtava).  I was offered a discount on this one in exchange for an honest review and knew I liked the brand so I figured I would give the other one to my mom and give this a shot.  My expectations were low for the diffuser because, like I said, they never work for me.  I just don&#x27;t like the Little Orphan Annie look (the classic one, not the cute new one lol!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well color me shocked!  I liked it!  It arrived this morning so I put it together and gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the two attachments that come with it look like they should screw on, but really they just snap on, so don&#x27;t bother trying to screw them on and wasting a good 5+ minutes doing that.  Not that I know anyone who may have done that or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I sprayed my hair with some spray gel and went to town with it on medium setting and the it wasn&#x27;t so horrible!  My hair dried fairly quickly which is unusual for me and it looked just like I had air dried it with lots of product- minus the crunch.  You curly haired folks know what I mean about the crunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then this afternoon I dried my daughter&#x27;s hair- it is long and thick and comes to just about her waist.  She&#x27;s 6.  You can imagine the usual torture that her hair care involves but it went relatively smoothly.  Her hair dried fairly quickly and evenly and is nice and smooth.  She even liked the color (and she&#x27;s a pink type chick) and asked to hold it- it wasn&#x27;t too heavy or bulky for her to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess what?  Mom gets my other Xtava and I have a new hair care item!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer on February 27th. The heating element stopped working on June 3rd (so it worked for only 3 months.) It will blow air, but not hot air. Returns not allowed after 30 days.</li>
    <li> Xtava Rimini 1800w Iconic Hair Dryer with Diffuser is awesome! It&#x27;s light weight, heats up quickly and works wonderfully. The diffuser helps keep hair frizz free and shiny, which is great. There are not only three heat levels, but two power levels, so there are loads of options to get the perfect setting for you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to review this Xtava Hair Dryer. All opinions are my own and not influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works so wonderfully! The diffuser is something I had never tried before, but I feel like it left my hair with fewer fly-aways. The dryer was powerful and helped me cut my &amp;#34;getting ready&amp;#34; time down by a few minutes, because the dryer I was using before wasn&#x27;t very good!  I&#x27;ve been using this nearly every day now for a few weeks and I have nothing but good things to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review to give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> So far used only one time, but I liked how it handled and it did a good job.</li>
    <li> I bought this in March and by July it stopped blowing hot air. It&#x27;s such a shame because it was a really great hair dryer when it was working. I noticed other reviewers have said the same thing, which makes me think it&#x27;s a flaw in the design.</li>
    <li> This dryer is so light weight!! I was amazing by that. It is perfect for what I needed.</li>
    <li> I love this Rimini Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Professional Hair Dryer with Diffuser by Xtava!!!&lt;br /&gt;When I received this hair dryer in the mail I was so excited to test it out as my old hair dryer just stopped working last week. Xtava Never fails to impress me with their products this dryer works amazingly!!! It has a stunning sleek blue &amp; black design!!!! It is very light weight making it a great dryer for someone like me with long hair that can take awhile to dry I need a dryer that I can hold for a long period of time without my wrist hurting &amp; getting tired. This dryer is made of high quality materials, which is great so it will last a longer time before needing a new one!! Its a powerful dryer and takes less time to dry then other dryers I have had it the past!! It comes with a customized Diffuser and concentration nozzle for precise styling and maximized condensed air flow control to the area you are targeting!!! It has two power speed settings &amp; 3 heat settings so you can adjust to your liking!!  I am really impressed with this dryer &amp; I definitely would recommend this Hair Dryer by Xtava &amp; brand to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is awesome! It uses tourmaline ionic technology for drying, which I was looking for. It dries my hair with less damage compare to other form dryers. Rimini 1500W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Professional Hair Dryer is inexpensive. It comes with concentration nozzle and customized diffuser. It is lightweight and the quality worth higher end hair dryers. It has cold shot button, 3 level heat button, and high and low power settings. I am pleasantly surprised by how good it works! It dryers my hair in half the time as my old dryer and my hair is so smooth and soft. No more frizzies. This product was provided for review by by Xtava.</li>
    <li> Wow! This dryer is powerful! I love the long thick quality cord. The dryer is made well but not too heavy like some profressional dryers. That can cause arm fatigue.  It comes with a diffuser and slit attachment which both attach securely without a problem.  The only thing I had a problem with is the latch on the back of the dryer. After some fiddling and a broken nail I got it. But lets be honest...the real reason I needed this dryer is because the color is to die for! I was fortunate enough to receive this product as complimentary to test and review for the company, and when I saw this electric blue color I fell in love. It is so beautiful! This is a very professional style hair dryer and the quality is evident.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair and I blow dry it frequently without any issues, I  love this blow dryer by Xtava! The hair dryer is awesome! It has three heat levels and two power levels. What&#x27;s amazing about this blower dryer is that it dries my hair super fast! I mean it cuts drying my hair in half! My hair usually is frizzy and dull,How awesome is that! I must add that I love all Xtava products! Xtava company has awesome quailty products! I can&#x27;t get enough of them! I highy recommend this blow dryer and all of Xtava other products to everyone that wants and needs, I got this product on a discount price for review purposes. thank you</li>
    <li> Im tired of this review being deleted.I rated it 5 stars so hopely it wont be deleted again. This hair dryer is heavy.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous hair dryer.  It comes in a nice box and a nice color blue.  It is so light weight which makes it easy to dry my long hair.  Normally it takes a while to dry my hair but with this hair dryer it probably cut the time in half.  It has a nice diffuser along with 3 heat settings.  I like to start out on high, then a curling brush and low heat and finally cool to set my hair.  I love the cool shot to set it too.  My hair has less frizzies and looks a lot healthier since using this hair dryer.  I am so glad I got to try it complimentary  for a honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I cannot express how much I love this hair dryer! It&#x27;s small and sleek. It gives me the hair I want to have, that look that I was always jealous of others having. I no longer look like a big frizz ball! I didn&#x27;t know that hair could look this good, and I&#x27;m thankful for the opportunity to test this product complimentary and give my experiences and feedback. I love all the features of this hair dryer. The cooling feature is by far the best feature along with the nozzles. I use to let my hair air dry and it took so long to dry being my hair is so long. This hair dryer took about 10-15 minutes. I didn&#x27;t get tangled hair that hurt brushing out like I did with other hair dryers. This is the best dryer!</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and long.  It dries frizzy without blowing it dry.  I do not get  the chance to go to the salon much.  The attachments on this dryer make me feel like I am doing something for myself without devoting more time.  I love the color blue and black.  I loved the opportunity to use this dryer.  In exchange for I am also providing my honest and unbiased opinion.  The drying time on my hair was cut down by a few minutes.  I have a three year old daughter that will not be still for anything. I used it on hers for just a minute on low cool.  It was perfect.  Not too strong but enough to help knock out the wetness.  I prefer the high warm on mine.  I do not need to further damage my hair.  Which means cutting out the drying time is preserving my hair some.  Without the attachments this hair  dryer should travel easily.  The cord is not too heavy and should roll up easily.</li>
    <li> I am so excited to have finally replaced my 10-year-old hair dryer..and with this beauty!&lt;br /&gt;My old hair dryer worked..just not very well. It only had one heat setting, and two speeds..which didn&#x27;t make it very versatile. This sleek-looking blue beauty is the perfect addition to my bathroom, and my hairstyling routine! :D&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer has THREE heat levels, and two power levels, PLUS a cool burst, so that I can &#x27;set&#x27; my hairstyle with a shot of cold air to really lock in the style! I LOVE that it came with a diffuser AND a concentration nozzle, so when you add the option of using just the dryer itself, you have THREE ways to use it!&lt;br /&gt;First, we used it to smooth out the plastic over our windows....the high setting was perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Then, I finally got to take a shower, and was thrilled to be able to dry my hair in just a few minutes! Usually I end up leaving my hair damp to avoid damaging it with high heat, but thanks to lower heat settings, I was able to completely dry my hair without heat-damaging it in record time!&lt;br /&gt;I thought that my hair looked surprisingly great and not-frizzy for having been blow-dried. I have color-treated hair, so it has a tendency to get too dry very easily. I have to be careful, and this dryer is the perfect solution!&lt;br /&gt;I was even able to dry my 4-year-old&#x27;s hair without her complaining that it was too hot. I was going to give my daughter my old dryer, but I&#x27;ve decided to use this beauty for the whole family, and give my old one to charity, so that someone who doesn&#x27;t have one at all can use it until they can get something like this! :D&lt;br /&gt;I received this hair dryer for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use. I was not told what to say, only asked to give an honest review based on my own experience with the product.</li>
    <li> Extremely fast delivery and the product works great. Very happy!</li>
    <li> I have had the opportunity to try quite a few Xtava products and I am overwhelmed by the quality of their items.  I&#x27;d never heard of Xtava prior to November and for being a virtual unknown in the heavily competitive beauty market, they really are creating products that will last.  I hope that they are able to get a foothold in this industry and keep on making such great items!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rimini blow dryer for starters, is a gorgeous hair dryer.  We desperately needed a new hair dryer because ours is ready to die anytime now.  This definitely is a step up from the cheapo dryer we had purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It drys our hair so quickly.  Even my daughter who has much thicker and coarse hair than myself it doesn&#x27;t take much time at all until her hair is completely dry.  There are two speed settings, low and high as well as three heat settings plus the Cold Shot button.  I find that I use the medium heat and the high speed settings the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it has a little hook on it so that you can easily hang it on a nail for easy access in your bathroom.  The cord is long enough to be able to style your hair just about anywhere you need it.  It&#x27;s not like REAL quiet, but it&#x27;s not as loud as some hairdryers.  It really is one of the best dryer&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s definitely the best hair dryer that I&#x27;ve ever personally owned!!  I&#x27;m so impressed by the quality of Xtava and their products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  Review Product Received</li>
    <li> Really good dryer but now its seriously overpriced. Bought ours on Amazon in March for only $32. Totally worth every penny, however totally NOT worth $200. Not sure where the price increase came from.....</li>
    <li> I have lots of hair,  this blow dryer gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair that takes forever to dry. Every morning, I spend about fifteen minutes blow-drying my hair with a regular dryer before I flat-iron it. After I tried this dryer for the first time, my hair was dry within seven minutes. I used the diffuser to prevent frizz and lifted my roots as I dried it. It gave my hair some extra bounce and body. I did not use any styling products except for a heat activated repair cream that I always use.  This is the only blow dryer I will use from now on and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a faster dry time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a free product for review purposes but it does not alter my opinions. I was not compensated in any other way.</li>
    <li> I am one of those lucky people who can achieve poker straight hair or curly hair just by the styling tool I use on the end of the blow dryer.  When I was given the opportunity to test this Ionic Hair dryer for quality, I was super excited.  There were many things I liked about this blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I like the shape of the unit.  I was able to hold the dryer by both the shaft and the handle depending on my needs to get the best angle for all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  It took about 1/3 less time to dry my hair than with my other blow dryer even though that one has more watts.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was due to the less drying time of the fact that this is an ionic dryer that my hair was less frizzy.  It&#x27;s winter here in Indiana and I generally have to use argon oil on my hair after drying to tame the frizzies.  I did not have to use the oil after using this blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  It&#x27;s extremely light weight and quieter than my previous dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  It came with both a diffuser and a concentration nozzle.  I use the diffuser when I want curly hair and the nozzle when I want to go straight and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice is a burning smell the first time I used the unit.  By the time I finished drying my hair though, the smell was gone.  Overall, I am very impressed with the quality and results of this Rimini Xtava.</li>
    <li> I have been impressed with each Xtava product I have tried and this hair dryer is no different. This dryer is powerful enough to dry my hair completely in a short amount of time. I like the attachments, especially the diffuser. I&#x27;m also quite fond of the bright blue color. Product provided to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product i was a little sketchy, as hair dryers normally make my hair super frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is amazing. The diffuser works just as it should. My normally frizzy hair was smooth and flyaway free, which is attributed to the ionic technology.&lt;br /&gt;This dryer has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings, as well as a cool button, which is always good after a long time of use on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Its very lightweight and easy to use. Even a beginner, like myself, can get use out of this product.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice cool blue tone on the front, which is good for me.&lt;br /&gt;All in all i&#x27;d say this product is the best hair dryer i have used to date. Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> EDIT This dryer&#x27;s heating element died about 3 months ago. It can only blow cool air now :( I expected it to last much much longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok I have to say... this is an awesome hairdyer!! The  Rimini 1500W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Professional Hair Dryer by XTAVA is LIGHTWEIGHT yet... super powerful! The very best party for me is the DIFFUSER and concentration nozzle. As you can see from my picture, my daughter has extremely curly hair and it only looks it&#x27;s very best when we use a diffuser until it is about 80% dry. You can see what it ends up looking like when it is left to air dry.. the curls fall out and are very flat. However, when we use the a GOOD diffuser and Iconic hair dyer they end up looking fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like how the diffuser is made to fit this particular blowdryer. No worries about it slipping off or being extra careful Just screw it on and it is part of the unit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dyer feels really good in your hands. Very sturdy feeling but not heavy. When you are blow drying your own hair it can be extremely tedious when you need to keep your arm up for a very long time. You will be able to dry for longer with this dryer because it ends up being so lightweight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer comes with all the settings you need as well. Cold &amp;#34;freeze&amp;#34; button for a cold blast, 3 fan speeds, and 3 degrees of warmness. Plus the US style plug has a reset button which is great because not all devices come with those anymore. The fan is the back is VERY well protected with a fine mesh screen. If you have EVER gotten your hair stuck in this end you know how important this feature is haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly.. the COLOR!!! how cute is it?? I&#x27;ve always had black or silver dryers. This is just a nice pop of color that wouldn&#x27;t look bad left out in your bathroom.</li>
    <li> Nice hair dryer. It comes with a diffuser and concentrator. Each piece snaps on the hair dryer and will not fall off. The concentrator snapped on easily. However, the diffuser was a little more difficult to snap on and off. I had to push harder but it eventually snapped on and I had to tug a little harder to remove it. It has three heat settings, cold, warm, and hot. You can definitely feel the differences in all three settings. It also has a &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button that you push and it gives you a blast of cold air. It really does feel cold too. I love the blue color. This hairdryer is very lightweight and comfortable to hold. This is a very nice looking and functional hair dryer that comes with everything I want. I am so excited to receive this product for my review because I love it and  my old hair drying had a big crack in it and it was time for a new one. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I have used other hair dryers from Xtava, and this one is by far my favorite. The other one was great for quickly drying my hair, but it left my ends feeling really dried out. This one takes a little longer to dry my hair, but it leaves my hair feeling so soft and not damaged at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is very easy and pretty straight forward to use. There are three heat settings on the heat switch, three speed settings on the speed switch, and a cool shot air button. On the heat switch you will find low, medium, and high temperatures. On the speed switch you will find off, gentle, and strong. The cool shot button is used to set your style. I like to use this dryer on him heat and strong speed. I use a round brush to style my hair, then the cool shot to set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer comes with two attachments, a concentrated and a diffuser. The diffuser is great for those with curly hair who want to reduce frizz. The connector is great for people who have straight hair. It really helps me style my hair straighter, without needing a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how hight weight this dryer is. I have been having some weird back/shoulder problems over the last couple years, so the lightweight hair dryer is something that I can really appreciate. I have small hands and I think that this is very easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer is quite and while it might not have the power you are used to, it works great. I like that my hair appears to be far less damaged with this dryer than any other i have used, and it only takes a couple more minutes to dry. That is a tradeoff I am more than willing to make. This is the dryer I will continue to use on a day to day basis. Like others, I did receive this to review, what I have written is honest. I would not mislead consumers as I would not want to be mislead. This is a product that I stand by.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer actually worked great for a few months but after using the cool button the other day it will not blow any warm air.</li>
    <li> I am not a person who is big on drying my hair or my daughters...I just cannot stand how long that it takes and how sore my arm feels after holding a heavy hair dryer for what seems like hours! This has not been my experience with the Rimini 1500W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Professional Hair Dryer by XTAVA! It is VERY light! When I first took it out of the box I thought that the lightness might indicate that it wasn&#x27;t of the highest quality and would perform as well I would hope...but that wasn&#x27;t the case! It worked very very well! It was light as I stated and didn&#x27;t make my arm feel like it was going to fall off and it was fast! I was able to dry my hair in about half of the time I could with my old cheapier dryer! Plus I didn&#x27;t feel like I was burning my head off, which is a huge plus! There are are three heat settings as well as two power settings, which allows you to have ultimate control of your blow drying experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this dryer has a cold shot button for setting your hair and I REALLY love that it comes with a consentrator nozzle which allows me to focus more on one particular spot! This is super convenient for me and a great feature of this fabulous dryer! I don&#x27;t know a ton about the  ionic, tourmaline and ceramic features...I just know that they DO make a difference and DO work! I really love this dryer and highly recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, comfortable effective hair drying option! I was sent this dryer to test out in my home, with that said, these thoughts and opinions are my own and I&#x27;m not sure that I could live without this dryer after being so spoiled!</li>
    <li> This Xtava Rimini 1800 W hair dryer totally blew me away! It is a powerful 1800 watt hair dryer comes with a customized diffuser and concentration nozzle for precise styling and maximized condensed air flow which makes it superb for achieving the absolute perfect desired look.&lt;br /&gt;I am a licensed cosmetologist and I can tell you from experience that this hair dryer is professional quality and is exactly what I would use in my home salon. It is adjustable with three heat levels and two power levels to achieve complete control of your styling and lock in your perfect look with the cool shot button.&lt;br /&gt; Styling hair is an art and a Stylist is only as good as her tools. This dryer is a top of the line styling tool which means it saves me time and energy while I am styling and I get the desired look almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;Say goodbye to frizz with this iconic hair dryer because it&#x27;s designed to emit powerful negative ions to seal and smooth the hair&#x27;s outer layer while it increases my hair&#x27;s own natural shine while providing me with healthy and hydrated hair. The Xtava Rimini 1800W Hair Dryer has totally exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received the Allure Hair Dryer during a promotion in exchange I would tell you what I thought about the Allure in this review. All statements made are solely my own and are based on my own personal experience while using this hair dryer. That being said, I would absolutely recommend this hair dryer to persons of all ages, it works better than great!</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this blow dryer again. It did arrive on time, but the package was damaged. I have yet to use the product so can not comment on its power, but aesthetically speaking it looks terrible. The diffuser does not screw on and the blue paint was chipping from the product. It looks as if I received one that was returned. I would not purchase this item again and I would not recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> This has got to be my favorite hair dryer EVER! I have very fine hair. It has been very damaged and I have been trying for quite some time to get it back in good condition. One of the things I have focused on is drying my hair on a cooler cycle. My hair drying routine with my old dryer was taking me over 10 minutes which is ridiculous considering how fine and thin my hair is. I have been using the Rimini dryer for almost a week now and I am in love with it! 3 minutes max (I am being conservative) to dry my hair on a medium heat... It takes about 4 minutes if I use the cool air function. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product - I have been looking for this for years!</li>
    <li> I was offered this product purely for testing purposes and providing my honest feedback. I think the dryer is a nice size and weight. Love the vibrant blue color and the two attachments, the diffuser and  concentration nozzle.  I have a lot of hair but its really fine so it doesn&#x27;t take overly long to dry it.  I have what one would call a short hairstyle but it&#x27;s shorter in some places and longer on top. With that being said I like that I can use low heat on the area that&#x27;s really close to my scalp and kicking up the heat after attaching the concentration nozzle for adding lift and body to the longer portions on top. I&#x27;ve yet to use the diffuser. At over 4&#x27; I don&#x27;t find the cord to be short at all as some reviewers have stated. My plug is close to my vanity so I guess I don&#x27;t need as much length as they did. I did find the concentration nozzle moved around as it heated up but most of previous dryers did the same so it wasn&#x27;t a huge shock to me. Lastly the smell was strong...as soon as you open the box you can smell an odor of plastic and it smells somewhat when you turn it on to use. I&#x27;m hoping this is will go away with time and in no way deflects from it&#x27;s usability. I also want to state that &amp;#34;Iconic&amp;#34; is not a feature of the dryer but used in a descriptive way as in &amp;#34;widely known and acknowledged especially for distinctive excellence&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:6b7e0afffc20a0848aca8b1d073aa4af]]My hair is fuller and shinier than it&#x27;s ever been now that I have this hair dryer! When I blow dry my hair I flip my head down and begin the process..I do this for 2 reasons..one is because my hair gets more body and looks fuller; and the second reason is because I feel like I get less frizzy hair on top of my head when I aim the blow dryer at the under side of my hair instead of the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to when this 1800W  blow dryer came in the mail. I had just gotten out of the shower so it was perfect timing. I plugged it in and used the diffuser attachment. The diffuser made so much difference in the way my hair looks and feels! Not only do I not have to flip my head over to blow dry anymore but I never have a frizzy hair day. My hair plumped up and got the full body look while I stood straight up blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it gives me options to use a cooler setting, and also the hook makes it really easy to hang up in the bathroom after I am done using it. My hair feels and looks great thanks to this hair dryer! The hair tool is well made and has a nice thick cord, which should help keep this hair dryer in working order for years. I do recommend this brand and style of hair dryer if you are looking for a new one. I was provided a sample for evaluation and review.</li>

    <li> Straight out of the box this is the best blow dryer I have ever used.  It is really light weight and easy to handle.  There are 3 settings and 2 temps with a cool blast for setting your hair.  I  have long thick frizzy hair that some days I would love to cut all off.  My other hair dryer, never got rid of any of the frizziness.  Big plus also is the diffuser  attachment that is included.  What a difference, with the 1800 watts my hair is dry in 1/2 the time and is smoother than I could have every imagined.  This is definitely a salon grade product at a great price.  I did receive at a special deal and love the fact that I was able to test such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have thick long hair that takes what it seems like hours to dry. So I had to see if this hair dryer  was as great as it says. And it is! My hair drying time got cut more than half of what it usually is. And my hair doesn&#x27;t feel frizzy like it does most of the time. I never tried a iconic hair dryer before but I heard good things about it. So I am excited to have this one. And it&#x27;s big but it is also light weighed, which makes it perfect. It comes with two attachments and I tell you when I tried both of them out, it felt good on my scalp. It was like a light massage. I am proudly leaving my honest opinion about this product that I have received.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a very long time since I&#x27;ve been able to really blow dry my hair without my arms killing me before it&#x27;s dry.  I ordered this blow dryer because many of the reviews I read talk about how lightweight it is.  However, I was still surprised when I received it and tried it out.  It&#x27;s sooooo light weight!  I was able to dry my entire head of long, thick hair before my arm gave out.  For so long I have had to plan ahead when I wash my hair and make sure there is enough time for it to air dry before I can use my other styling tools.  With this Xtava Rimini hair dryer, I&#x27;ll be able to cut my drying/styling time way down!  Also surprising is how powerful it is with being so lightweight.  The diffuser works well too and my hair seems to be less frizzy and feel softer after using this dryer.  The last time I was at the salon, the assistant went over my head with the cool setting after blow drying and it felt really good.  With the cool shot button on this dryer, I can do the same thing.  It seems to sort of &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the hair so if you don&#x27;t plan to style further, the smoothness after drying will last longer.  The dryer comes in a very nice box that I&#x27;ll continue to use to store my dryer and the attachments in when it&#x27;s not in use.  The dryer has several heat and speed settings that I&#x27;m still playing with in order to find what&#x27;s best for my hair.  The electric blue color is great too.  I had a little bit of trouble getting the diffuser to stay on, but I that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m not familiar with how to use it and it could have been user error.  I&#x27;m happy I was able to receive this item in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I wanted and looks exactly like the picture. It works awesome.</li>
