### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I ended up with a Tom&#x27;s unscented soap as a replacement for the wonderful Oilatum soap that is no longer sold in the US.</li>
      <li>this soap is awesome.</li>
      <li>I was extremely happy to find it on Amazon and the price was excellent.</li>
      <li>Jergens neither dries out nor causes skin to break out; neither clogs the sinuses nor causes them to drain; while working beautifully for every family member from youngest to oldest.</li>
      <li>This is also good deal.</li>
      <li>but it cleans good with out leaving</li>
      <li>In the summer, when shipped, the heat causes the paper to stick to the bar fairly well.  </li>
      <li>I like this soap because it lathers up good</li>
      <li>i was very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>great price, loved the free shipping.</li>
      <li>This is a great price on some quality, mild soap!  </li>
      <li>Good deal on Good Clean Soap.  </li>
      <li>The wrapping sometimes doesn&#x27;t come off very easily though, for some reason.</li>
      <li>I use to be able to get this soap at almost any store</li>
      <li>I wanted something cheap but still nice smelling.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>the scent is not too strong.</li>
      <li>Love the price, arrived in timely manor, works wonderfully, bars are smaller then normal, and go a lot faster</li>
      <li>It used to be available in ALL stores.</li>
      <li>Good buy, soap does not dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>So this is a good basic soap like Ivory.</li>
      <li>it was sent quickly and promptly after i ordered it.</li>
      <li>really helps my skin feel smooth and blemish free.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dissolve quickly.</li>
      <li>I loved the soft scent of this soap (it was the real thing not a knock off)  </li>
      <li>The bar is a good size and is not missing a chunk out of the middle like most companies are doing these days to save a buck.</li>
      <li>Favorite facial soap.</li>
      <li>This Jergens soap gets you clean without drying out the skin, unlike most other bar soaps.</li>
      <li>Not actually unscented, this soap has a strong smell like Ivory but twice as powerful.  </li>
      <li>Hard to find locally around me, very mild soap good for people with skin problems and very reasonably priced for what you get.</li>
      <li>so I really can&#x27;t fault them for it.</li>
      <li>instead soft and refreshed!</li>
      <li>Like most of the other reviews, this is a plain (non deodorant) soap with a mild scent.  </li>
      <li>Very difficult to find in local stores, very happy with the price and the produce.</li>
      <li>but, I no longer can find it in any retail store near my home.</li>
      <li>The only soap my bf uses -  very convenient to order online and have it shipped because I can only find it in Walgreens</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as I am used to (I&#x27;m guessing this is due to them not including some certain regular bar soap chemicals), but it still gets the job done.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good deal on Good Clean Soap.  No overpowering deodorants or fragrances.  And it is MADE IN USA!&lt;br /&gt;Would Recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> So this is a good basic soap like Ivory. However, I associate Jergens brand with the lotion and somehow thought this soap would be moisturizing like Dove. That is not the case but it&#x27;s not advertised that way so I really can&#x27;t fault them for it. I don&#x27;t think I would be the only one to make this association though so I thought I&#x27;d put the word out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jergens Bar soap for 30+ years. Other soaps caused rashes or itchiness or are just too expensive and don&#x27;t last long. I use to be able to get this soap at almost any store but, I no longer can find it in any retail store near my home. I was extremely happy to find it on Amazon and the price was excellent.</li>
    <li> Love the price, arrived in timely manor, works wonderfully, bars are smaller then normal, and go a lot faster but it cleans good with out leaving you feel sticky, but instead soft and refreshed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Jergens for almost 30 years. It used to be available in ALL stores. Today, I can find it only at Dollar Tree or through Amazon. Jergens neither dries out nor causes skin to break out; neither clogs the sinuses nor causes them to drain; while working beautifully for every family member from youngest to oldest. In my life, Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap is for my face and hair. Jergens soap is for everything else.</li>
    <li> Hard to find locally around me, very mild soap good for people with skin problems and very reasonably priced for what you get.</li>
    <li> Good buy, soap does not dry out my skin. The wrapping sometimes doesn&#x27;t come off very easily though, for some reason.</li>
    <li> I like this soap because it lathers up good and it is not overly scented.  The bar is a good size and is not missing a chunk out of the middle like most companies are doing these days to save a buck.</li>
    <li> Not actually unscented, this soap has a strong smell like Ivory but twice as powerful.  I need unscented items since a whiff of perfume gives me a sinus infection, almost instantly.  This soap soon had me reacting as if it was perfumed.  I ended up with a Tom&#x27;s unscented soap as a replacement for the wonderful Oilatum soap that is no longer sold in the US.</li>
    <li> Favorite facial soap. Doesn&#x27;t taste soapy if it gets on your lips!</li>
    <li> This is a great price on some quality, mild soap!  This Jergens soap gets you clean without drying out the skin, unlike most other bar soaps.</li>
    <li> We have no complaints on this soap.  I wanted something cheap but still nice smelling.  This is it!  Price is spot on too!</li>
    <li> I loved the soft scent of this soap (it was the real thing not a knock off)  great price, loved the free shipping.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to find in local stores, very happy with the price and the produce.</li>
    <li> Just a regular white bar soap. I have also heard from some friends that they find this less irritating to their skin than the Dove white bar soap. It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as I am used to (I&#x27;m guessing this is due to them not including some certain regular bar soap chemicals), but it still gets the job done. This is also good deal. 24 Bars for $8! (A little bit cheaper than what my local stores are selling them for).</li>
    <li> I love the smell. the scent is not too strong. Doesn&#x27;t dissolve quickly. Even my kids like it. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Like most of the other reviews, this is a plain (non deodorant) soap with a mild scent.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin like some other soaps/deodorant bars. My only complaint is the paper wrapper.  In the summer, when shipped, the heat causes the paper to stick to the bar fairly well.  It took a week or two indoors to get the bars to where they did not stick to the wrapper.  Not a huge issue, but I took off a star for it.</li>
    <li> The only soap my bf uses -  very convenient to order online and have it shipped because I can only find it in Walgreens</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3.5 oz bars. They sent the 4.5 oz bars. I&#x27;m not happy about it and don&#x27;t want to bother with the hassle of returning it.</li>
    <li> this soap is awesome. really helps my skin feel smooth and blemish free. it was sent quickly and promptly after i ordered it. i was very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
