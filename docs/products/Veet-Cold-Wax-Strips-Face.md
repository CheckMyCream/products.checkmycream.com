<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I decided to try these for my upper lip. I&#x27;m Asian, so my hair is dark but it&#x27;s not that coarse. Previously I&#x27;d been using the Sally Hansen wax strips, but I felt like trying something new...and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I was so impressed! When you rub the strips together in your hands, it really does seem to almost liquefy them. These have a totally different consistency than the Sally Hansen ones (and in a good way). As per the directions, I placed down the wax (at a diagonal, following the direction of hair growth) and vigorously rubbed it in the direction the hair grows, then ripped the strip from the bottom up, pulling against the direction of hair growth. ALL my hairs were visible on the wax strip after one pull. The Sally Hansen ones were decent, but they never managed to remove all the hair and sometimes I&#x27;d have to go over the same spot 2 or 3x. I&#x27;d never tried Veet before, but now I&#x27;m even considering trying some of their other products to see if they&#x27;re just as effective as these wax strips :)</li>
    <li> They work. I have coarse facial hair. They work good. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> These work a lot better than I expected. I didn&#x27;t think the wax would be warm enough just rubbing it in my hands like that, but it worked. I was also able to use the strip two to three times before the sticky was gone, so I only needed to use one set. This box should last a long time, making it really worth the money. My only complaint is the size of the wax strip itself compared to the backing cloth. The cloth is so wide that you can&#x27;t see to line up the next strip with the area you&#x27;ve just waxed, and the strip is so narrow that one &#x27;pull&#x27; wasn&#x27;t enough. If the wax was wider or the cloth narrower (so I could see to line the wax up better) I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my face break out with tons of tiny little zits and irritation.  I did my upper lip and brows.  It lasted several days.</li>
    <li> I am 35 and have been waxing my upper lip for many years.  It seems that heat and humidity can influence the waxing process and yield varying results.  I have yet to mater the basics of this, but I am very gentle and cautious when waxing at home, knowing what the hazardous result can be if I am not. I have taken skin off before when waxing.  I was never quite sure if I rubbed too much or too hard after waxing, trying to get the wax out with the baby oil wipe or washing it off afterwards, so I am very careful now with the process.  If I don&#x27;t wax my upper lip, I will develop a little mustache of fine hairs.  They are too fine to pluck, so wax is my only cost-effective alternative (short of learning how to thread my own upper lip - I have tried and it is pretty challenging and not very effective.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, for nearly the fifth time using Veet facial wax strips, I took nearly half of the skin area that I was waxing off with the wax strip.  I can tolerate this no more!  I was careful with the pressure, pulled it off at just the right angle, and was very gentle with the cleaning afterwards and did not rub at all.  Frankly, I don&#x27;t care to go through this again to find out just what the cause is anymore.  It hurts a lot and I will have embarrassing and painful red marks over my lip for a week or so while it heals and then drys out and eventually the dead skin peels and flakes away.  It&#x27;s not worth it to me anymore, I&#x27;m switching brands.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to my worst enemy.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this product and again, my hopes were dashed. (Except for shaving, I have yet to find a hair remover that works) It was a joke. And a complete waste of money.  It did absolutely nothing for me except make my chin sticky as heck.  The wax was so soft, and remained so soft, I didn&#x27;t see how it could possibly work unless I stuck my head in the freezer for a few minutes.  No thanks.  I&#x27;ll stick to shaving.  It&#x27;s easier and much less messy...hey, and much more effective.</li>
    <li> As long as you follow the exact directions that come in the box on the instruction sheet, this will work as indicated. I bought this to use on my upper lip. I have a bit of sensitive skin so I did break out in a few pimples about a day or two later but they quickly went away and there were only a few. Left skin smooth and clear of hair. There was a bit of redness but that went away within an hour or two of applying. There was no further irritation.</li>
    <li> better than paying at a salon, satisfied.</li>
    <li> just too damn small to do any good damage</li>
    <li> Works very well! I use mine for the upper lip and it does a great job. The redness lasted less than an hour after the fact, but that would probably depend on your skin sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like these</li>
    <li> hair MUST be long enough for wax to grab on the hair or you will be stuck with little hairs all over.. I never seem to get all the hair, even having a friend do it..I dont like having to wait weeks in between waxing just to have legs smooth a little longer.. so I find myself shaving again... Professional waxing is MUCH better,, and about 15 dollars per leg.. not much more cost and does a way better job.</li>
    <li> The box was opened and only half of the strips were delivered.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth even a single cent. It doesn&#x27;t remove any hair at all. If you enjoy the feeling of pulling wax off your face then I guess this is for you. If you want an effective product I&#x27;d suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Great product and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Best product I have found.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me.  I was pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> removes the big hair but the little guys stay on my chin tight</li>
    <li> These are great at home wax strips. I use them for my eyebrows, and they work extremely well. I just trim smaller pieces from the big strips in order to make them easier to use on the face.</li>
    <li> Not removing haires.... After using, my face and hands get sticky all over.</li>
    <li> terrible. wax just peeled off the strip and onto my face in a gooey mess. Tried twice - have used other wax strips before with no problems. It wasn&#x27;t warmer than 75 degrees in the house - so i&#x27;m not sure what went wrong. i would have given no stars but that&#x27;s not possible. complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using wax on my upper lip. I made sure to follow the instructions completely and at first, when I pulled the wax off, I felt like I had ripped off half of my face. But it only hurt for about 2 seconds and it removed about 85% of the hair on my first try. I had been using hair removal creams and would always end up with red patches/burns. This veet wax is a hundred times better. I will never use hair removal creams again. I think I will get better at using this product and eventually see/improve my results. I like this because it&#x27;s so easy to use and is a very good price. I can&#x27;t say everyone will have the same results but I definitely recommend trying it, at least!</li>
    <li> These work great. They are so easy to use and I like how they are so easy to use and no clean up or mess. If you are in a hurry these are perfect.</li>
    <li> If your goal is to adorn your unwanted facial hair with gooey wax then this is the product for you! Or perhaps you&#x27;re the variety who enjoys giving yourself intense facial burn from the skin it takes off. I&#x27;m still not sure how it can remove skin and yet leave the hair completely intact, it&#x27;s a wonder.</li>
    <li> These are hard to use and really don&#x27;t work well for fine hair on the upper lip. You would have to grow it out pretty dang long for it to be effective. I would reccomed getting it waxed when you get your brows done.</li>
    <li> Honestly, these strips didn&#x27;t work at all. Used it on my face only to remove skin and leave hairs behind. Awful! It stung and looked HORRIBLE. I do not recommend these.</li>
    <li> It seriously felt like I just stuck a sucker on my eyebrown and tried to pull hair off with it. I tried the wax in like three different temperatures, and still, it did absolutely nothing. To all those people saying it was so adhesive that it peeled the top layer of skin off, please share your secret, because I can&#x27;t get it to pull ANYTHING off. Leaving the strip on for a bit doesn&#x27;t even work, and I&#x27;m pulling toward my nose, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is garbage, and not worth 7 bucks.</li>
    <li> These are much better than some other cold wax strips I&#x27;ve tried. You don&#x27;t need to heat them too much to separate them and they pull a lot of hair. My skin doesn&#x27;t like waxing much, though.</li>
    <li> it left trails of gluey wax on my forehead which was more painful, the wipes provided are doused in oil and has a weird citronella kind of smell.&lt;br /&gt;it was horrible for the job it was meant to do as it didn&#x27;t remove any hair ....a big thumbs down</li>
    <li> They work great and was shipped fast</li>
    <li> My daughter has started using wax strips and she likes this brand.  I hate it because there is now wax stuck all over the bathroom!  Pricing seems good, a bit lower than the local mega-marts</li>
    <li> Pros: Worked well the first few times I did it. Cons: Every other time since these have not worked at all. They come with 20 strips, but I really only got use out of the first 2 or 3. It seemed like after a couple of weeks the strips got melty- too melty to work correctly. They would just leave a bunch of sticky goo on my face and not pull out any hair.  I tried putting them in the refrigerator to to cool them down, but to no avail. Then, there are only 4 wipes. This product will leave very sticky wax on your face and if there are no more wipes left (do the math, 20 strips, 4 wipes) it is pretty much impossible in my experience to get the wax off. I guess Vaseline kind of helped, but the product should come with enough for every use.</li>
    <li> While this product is better than most wax strips in removing hair, it may be a little too effective- it ripped off the skin on my lip!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little messy for my taste cause I would have leftover wax on my face but the oil cleansing sheets definitely help, leaving your skin smooth (a bit too shiny though). This kind of thing definitely takes practice because it took me a couple of tries to get rid of all of my facial hair. the strips can be a bit smaller too but i cut them into little strips so no big deal. otherwise pretty goood for someone who doesnt like going to the salon.</li>
    <li> Product is way too rough (used the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin),too much product on the strips, leaves very gooey residue impossible to get off with the wipes provided (which contain acetone!) and the formula seems to have changed, as I did not get chemical burns before and had used many times successfully. Not sure whether the burn and scabbing was from the wax strips or the wipes, but these are definitely too harsh.</li>
    <li> This removes most of my hair, and is not too messy.  I have blondish hair, so it is not very coarse.  This is the easiest way I have found so far for waxing.</li>
    <li> Love these wax strips they. Are. The best and they work great, so this is definitely a 5 stars,thanks so much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not found this product very good at all.  I tried this brand because Veet is well known, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a great product it would seem.  Despite following the instructions the wax is an inferior quality and the wax-area on the strip is smaller than others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Very effective and gentle..</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible product. Did not work at all!! Only left a sticky mess of soft wax on my skin. Didn&#x27;t remove any hair. Used baby oil to remove sticky mess of wax- glad I knew this trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried Sally Hansen wax strips and it worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I retried the veet strips one more time to double check, and I had the exact same issues. I guess I was unlucky and got a defective box!!</li>
    <li> Great strips.  Super easy, affordable, and effective.  Just follow the directions and it will work as it&#x27;s supposed to.  The wax is easily removed with coconut oil too.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using alcohol to remove the wax on a freshly waxed piece of skin.</li>
    <li> These work, they actually work! Unlike the leg and body ones, they remove all the hair. My face was only red for about 10 minutes and it didn&#x27;t hurt. Well, only a little bit anyway. And the wipes removed all the excess wax. Quick, easy and effective. I love these. Saves me money from going to the salon.</li>
    <li> It works well for me, but I giving 3 stars to the seller because I receved only 18 wax strips instead 20. I&#x27;m very upsed because I subscribed to the product.</li>
    <li> This product will completely burn your face!    DO NOT TRY TO KEEP PULLING HAIR OFF  IF YOU DIDNT DO IT THE FIRST TIME.    I&#x27;m suffering a huge burn on my  face. I really don&#x27;t know what to do and its  scary because I dont know if it&#x27;s going to leave  a huge scar...save yourself the horror. DONT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I love these wax strips.  I have tried nair brand, sally hansen, nad&#x27;s......and these strips are superior.  They are easy to use, less painful, and don&#x27;t leave as much residue as the others.  I especially love that they even get most of the little tiny baby hairs.....you know the ones you normally have to pluck after you wax.  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> It WILL rip off the skin in the area...but leave the hair behind. COMPLETELY POINTLESS.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like these at all. Maybe it&#x27;s me and I&#x27;m not putting it on correctly but they are messy and they don&#x27;t pull off the hair. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this brand again.</li>
    <li> I use it in between  shaving when I have time and it works ok on the lips. A bit painful</li>
    <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member. Although I am a member, this is my own personal story and experience. My friend Brooke recommended Veet Facial Hair Remover Cold Wax Strips and I am delighted that she did. This is my first attempt at removing facial air with anything other than tweezers, so I was a little nervous and skeptic. I ordered the strips and we took them on our gf getaway for mani/pedis and facials. She did hers first so I could watch and she showed me which directions to pull the strips back off and it was so easy and worked liked a charm. I am so happy, because I can&#x27;t see much at all and I needed a safe way for hair removal. Now my mission is to buy some more of these strips, some for my eyebrows, and my legs. No more razors for this lady! Thanks VEET!</li>
    <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member. I really like how the strips feel on my lip..I use to hate getting waxed because it burned! But not with these cold wax strips...so much nicer and easy to use! No having to have a professional for these!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my Latin genes have kicked in and what was once one or two hairs has evolved...I now have more of a mustache and thicker chin hair than most adolescent boys... Threading is good but gets expensive so I thought to try wax. The first time I used it, after the patch test, it didn&#x27;t work at all. Nothing came off and I was left with sticky glue everywhere that wouldn&#x27;t come off even with the wipe, so I have little bits of glue stuck to my upper lip and chin for a few days even after I washed my face twice daily. So I wait a week and a half and try again...This time the hair comes off...And takes half my face with it!!!!!!!!! It was SOOOO red and irritated after the one swipe that it was painful to move my face at all :( I thought it would go away but today it&#x27;s still so red I can&#x27;t hide it with makeup and it has scabbed over and looks like painful crocodile skin. I tried rubbing CerAve lotion into it since it&#x27;s gentle and it&#x27;s softer but still red and STINGS when I first apply the lotion...So unhappy. I am a grown woman and it looks so &amp;#34;highschool experiment gone wrong.&amp;#34; NOT happy. I do have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve had my face waxed professionally before and never had this issue. I threw the other strips out.</li>
    <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member. These Veet facial wax strips worked really great and I only had to use 1 strip each time over a 3 week-month time period. They removed all the hair the first time and didn&#x27;t leave my face red or sore like the last brand I used. With this being said I would definitely recommend this product to those with sensitive skin like myself. The price is affordable as well, compared to others that cost a lot more and are not as good.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I have tried hair removal cream for the face, but always end up a burnt, bloody mess (ok, exaggeration, but it is not pretty). I ordered a few different brands to try out with wax for the face and just tried this one tonight. It works really well. I tried it on my peach fuzz on my upper lip, which I normally try to pluck, which seems to take forever, and I am way too impatient for that, and the product worked very well. It took off most of the hair, not all. I still have to go back over with a tweezers, but it&#x27;s manageable. 10 hours later, and there is no redness, no tenderness. I will go with this product again in the future. I don&#x27;t know how well it works on the bikini area or underarms, which is what it also seems to be for, so am not sure how it is with coarser hair. I can definitely recommend it, however, for use on the small hairs on the face for someone with sensitive skin. It is very easy to use with very little mess.</li>
    <li> Very weak, does not remove much hair.</li>
    <li> It somehow doesn&#x27;t have the best grip compared to other wax strips, but its satisfactory&lt;br /&gt;Even enough to buy the product again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price , its worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if your budget is better than mine you can go for a better product</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t rip my skin like the other brand did. Have ordered again.</li>
    <li> It removed majority of hair from my upper lip but irritated and left some dry patchyness on it. I stopped using it and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it again. The patches didn&#x27;t go away for like 2 weeks. I used the oily napkin things that came with it but it still got irritated.  I would much rather just pay to get it taken off.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and does a good job in removing upper lip hair.  The wax stays soft over time not like the old wax they used to make that came in the blue box</li>
    <li> The wax stays on your face and doesn&#x27;t remove any hair</li>
    <li> So at first I had to read online...is it 20 strips or 10 two-sided; I thought some amazon gremlin stole 10 of my strips but lo and behold it&#x27;s 10 two-sided strips which mathematically means 20 strips.  A bit of a marketing &amp;#34;ploy&amp;#34; if you ask me.  But anyway after now going through a box of these I&#x27;m not entirely sure where I stand.  While it works...it seems like I grow back faster than other strips I&#x27;ve used.  Maybe it&#x27;s not grabbing the follicle enough?!  I don&#x27;t know...I&#x27;ll give it another 20 strips and then I&#x27;ll make my decision.</li>
    <li> They do just what you need for a small area. I like them for the convenience and easy clean up.</li>
    <li> Does not pull off chin hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip wax I&#x27;ve ever used. Painless soft wax and doesn&#x27;t leave hairs behind.</li>
    <li> The only thing I would change is the scent.  No fragrance is necessary and I am sensitive to most fragrances.</li>
    <li> It gets some and hurts pretty bad but it never gets them all. I might have to go to a salon or something.</li>
    <li> This product works well for me between trips to the salon!  Tip: rather than warming up the wax by rubbing the strip between your hands, aim the blow dryer at it for a few seconds.  Works much better!</li>
    <li> I have used face strips bought from drugstores. they take out hair pareity well once you get used to it. But I get so many bumps on my face after using it. May be it&#x27;s just my skin or the product i don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> These strips hurt SO bad but got rid of so much hair!!! I kept going on my upper lip over spots I missed and the product is so strong it literally ripped off an entire 1 in by 1 in layer of top skin near my lip, causing burning, redness, and then scabbing (ouch). This is 3 days later now and I still can&#x27;t find a way to cover it up with the dryness and ton of MAC Make-up coverup I own. So, If you buy it, it&#x27;s cheap, so it&#x27;s easy to screw up. Unless you&#x27;re a professional who can work with a crappy product with a smile, buy something that easier to use at home and won&#x27;t leave a scar.....because I sure as hell am hoping this won&#x27;t (fingers crossed).</li>
    <li> I use to use Sally Hansen wax strips until I saw all the great customer reviews on this product.  I am so glad I tried these wax strips.  They work way more effectively due to the cloth backing.  These will definitely be my new go to wax strips.</li>
    <li> Excellent ; removes even very very small hairs on face :) I use it for 2/3 years and had no problem.  I am wondering why they increased the price! I bought this wax strips for 5$ a couple of months ago! I am shocked!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are very convenient for removing any unwanted hair.  It only takes a few seconds and save you a lot of money and time.  Once I purchased this product I stopped spending money at the salons.  I use this for my lip area and it removes all the unwanted hair quickly.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Walgreens and it worked so well that I got on here to buy more. I was very surprised to find nearly all negative reviews so I wanted to share my experience. I don&#x27;t know exactly what the other reviewers are doing in order to actually remove skin but I would guess the skin their waxing is not being pulled taut enough. I think it&#x27;s an extremely important step in the instructions when waxing thin and sensitive areas like the upper lip. Also if you miss a few hairs the first time around you need to wait awhile, until the next day possibly before waxing the same spot. It says that clearly in the enclosed instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a firm believer that not every wax works for every person or even every location on on persons body. These strips worked fine in the middle of my brows but I wouldn&#x27;t use them for shaping, their just too large for me for that purpose. I have used Nair melon scented microwaveable sugar wax on my brows before and it worked perfectly, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my upper lip except hurt really bad. I&#x27;ve also tried Sally hansons hard wax for face and it again, did nothing but hurt. The hairs on my upper lil are very short and fine, barely noticeable except to me. So I gave these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rubbed one strip between my palms for probably 15 seconds, longer than necessary but I wanted to be sure it was warm enough. Following the directions I did one side of my upper lip at a time. I set one strip down an applied one to the right side. I rubbed downwards on the strip several times in really quick firm motions....probably creating a little more heat. Then I held my upper lip straight down to make the skin very taut and from the outside in I pulled back on the strip quickly staying as close to my skin as possible and pulling the strip straight back on itself towards my nose as instructed. It hurt but was over in an instant and it removed all but the tiniest hairs. There was still plenty of wax on that stripso I did the same thing on the other side of my upper lip using the same strip over again. Once again it worked beautifully. Since I still had a whole other strip to use I touched up only the corners of my upper lip where I&#x27;d missed entirely. I then used that strip to go up and do the area between my brows. I applied the strip and rubbed it briskly upwards as directed. Again, probably creating a little more heat to the wax. Then holding my brows apart to keep the skin very tight I pulled the strip down quickly, staying as close to my skin as possible and once again these strips did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think everyone has to find not only what product works for them but should also consider using different products and brands all together on different body parts if need be. This one happens to work perfectly for my upper lip and between my brows and I&#x27;ll probably give it a shot on my legs and under arms if it doesn&#x27;t cut it there for me I&#x27;ll just keep trying different waxes until I find what does.  In the mean time I would encourage those with very fine and short upper lip hair like mine to give these a shot in spite of the negative reviews. It&#x27;s not super expensive and you may be extremely pleased with the results as I am.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using the Veet brand strips on my face and had a very unfortunate reaction. I broke out into the nastiest hives and itchiest I&#x27;ve ever experienced! I have successfully used formulas from Nads, Parissa, and Sally Hansen for years and never once had a reaction while waxing before, so I am quite upset. In terms of hair removal, the strips worked quite well. However unfortunately the hives are not worth it! I will be throwing away the remaining product and going back to my trusty old brand.</li>
    <li> i like this a  lot better than the sally hansen. this you can one strip atleast twice but the sally hansen ones are only sticky for one time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why so many people complain about cold wax strips. To me, they work perfectly. However, I have only tried it on my face (note that it is very risky to do it on your eyebrows, only do between them). The pain is completely bearable, and I am usually overly sensitive. Sometimes within the next 24h a bump or two will show up on my face, but no big deal at all. And that happens with all brands. Considering quality and price, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t get it, but I found these very hard to use, and very very sticky after trying to wax. Even with the wipe I had to scrub it off hard.</li>
    <li> Didnt like them at all. Dont stick well so absolutely useless!</li>
    <li> hands down my favorite wax strips for the face. much much better than sally hansen. gets even the tiniest hairs out. easy to use. very affordable too!</li>
    <li> Works, it did not remove short hairs as it claimed it would, but that is difficult. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Good buy. I&#x27;d buy it again&lt;br /&gt;I can finally say goodbye to shaving</li>
    <li> This works great for older men also. Getting hair in your ears and tired of plucking or watching them grow. these strips are great every week or two to clean up those unwanted hairs.</li>
    <li> “I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried creams but they irritate my skin. I have found that this cold wax strips works best for me. It easily removes unwanted hair above my lips. The results seem to last a reasonable amount of time and the price for the amount of strips is fair.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but I will not purchase this product again. My upper lip stays very red where the wax was &amp; burns for a couple days after. It&#x27;s noticeable that I had waxed it. Also it made my upper lip super dry.</li>
    <li> My favorite brand.  Somehow they do the job that the rest leave behind - ladies you know what I mean - without the hassle of hot wax.</li>
    <li> I love the simplicity of this product however it is a little harsh on my sensitive skin would just be careful with this product</li>
    <li> This product works as well as waxing at a beauty salon.</li>
    <li> This works well, I use this for my bikini area and stomach. It is painful, initially but after a while your skin gets used to it. It does manage to pull out all of my hair. I don&#x27;t usually have to use it twice in the same area.</li>
    <li> I got this last week in my mailbox and I tried it on my upper lip yesterday! Unlike some other reviewers mentioned - the strips are not dry! They are as expected and were in good condition. Just be very sure to read the instructions before you head off pulling out some hair! That will help to avoid any mess you might make in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that a slight wax residue was left on my upper lip as I pulled off the wax strip, (And, a little is acceptable and expected) but the cleansing wipes given along with this product are soooo good, that even one goes a long way, and can be used until the next time! It has a lot of oil to wipe clean any residual wax off your face. So no problems there! I now have another one of this set ordered for me, and its going to be a constant supply in my house ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for the times, when you can&#x27;t run off to the beauty parlours due to shortage of time, or the times when you are travelling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the final result of using this wax strip was a absolutely neat &amp; tidy skin area (in my case, upper lip). I am sooo pleased with how well it worked! No half-effective outcomes - it worked a 100%. Does what it says, and does it very well! Go ahead and buy one and trust me, you wont be disappointed! :)</li>
    <li> Veet is insisting I leave a good review of this product. They won&#x27;t leave me alone. I don&#x27;t know what to say. Do I leave a good review or risk getting harassing email from Veet?</li>
    <li> easy to use and nice product!</li>
    <li> I was scared by the comments. It&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t hurt too much for me. It&#x27;s not good with short coarse hair and the wax strip is super thin. Prolly won&#x27;t buy it again though.</li>
    <li> They are smaller than they used to be or I would have given them 5 stars.  They are the best strips out there but I wish they had kept hem the same size!</li>
    <li> This product works great and will save you a lot of money!&lt;br /&gt;Although not included in the instructions I find it best to use a combination of hot and cold.&lt;br /&gt;I warm up the strip between my hand to separate the two sides,&lt;br /&gt;I apply the strip to one side of the upper lip and press down for full contact,&lt;br /&gt;then, I rub an ice-cube over the strip back and forth a few times, otherwise the wax it&#x27;s too gooey to work,&lt;br /&gt;I rip off swiftly like a bandage,&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s all gone.&lt;br /&gt;A few stubborn ones can be removed with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I use a rich moisturizer cream to remove the left over wax, it works much better that the oil wipes.</li>
    <li> Work well, virtually painless and quick.</li>
    <li> These work great. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands that don&#x27;t work at all, and really shouldn&#x27;t even be sold. Veet, however, works great for the fine hairs on the face..</li>
    <li> cheapest way to get a quick wax on thin hair</li>
    <li> just read the box great product works just as describe, remove hair perfectly without hurting the skin, gonna buy againg</li>
    <li> These strips work great.  I was a little hesitant to try.  Will be buying again for sure.  Will not need to go to the salon.</li>
    <li> The strips are very harsh on the skin, I&#x27;m never going to use them again.</li>
    <li> Works very well for me. I do not have much facial hair and I used to pull it one by one with a tweezer, but it is hard as I need glasses.&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to use and works fast without any significant problems.</li>
    <li> I was using a brand for 10+yr&#x27;s and was only available at 1 store so I decided to try the Veet brand. Super results and half the price..Excellent product</li>
    <li> Great product. I noticed If you don&#x27;t pull it fast it will become sticky. By once you pull it correctly it works great and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
    <li> Works great best wax strips for upper lip</li>
    <li> This is a great product to get rid of facial hair. It is really easy to use and will save lots of money.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to comment on the previous review by jmz.&lt;br /&gt;Jmz: &amp;#34;Someone else mentioned this packaging flaw: you get 20 wax strips (which are really 40 once you pull them apart)&amp;#34; -- in the package you get 10 pairs of strips which makes 20 individual strips.&lt;br /&gt;Jmz: &amp;#34;But what about the other one? Well, it&#x27;s sitting there, being cooled down. And it&#x27;s not as effective. And well, design flaw, anyone?&amp;#34; --indeed the other strip just stays there cooling. What I did, I folded the strip and warmed it up again. Actually, I need just one strip per use, so I fold the other side and leave it until the next time.&lt;br /&gt;Jmz: &amp;#34;For whatever reason, this side just didn&#x27;t work as well as the first side. Fresh wax strip or no, it just was not happening.&amp;#34; --I assume this is because we are either right/left-handed which makes it harder to use on &amp;#34;the other side&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my comments will be helpful!</li>
