      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it online.</li>

      <li>I love this color for fading on eyelids with the gold color on lids.  </li>

      <li>I have ordered this more than once and love the color.  </li>
      <li>Love it....</li>
      <li>LOve it...</li>
      <li>I got mine at Wal-Mart, but it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love this matte, velvet&#x27;y shadow.</li>
      <li>Lovely brown color in a matte color.  </li>
      <li>very beautiful when you smoke it out w/ Black liner.</li>
      <li>Please keep it available.</li>
      <li>Goes on lightly, if applied correctly, but can get really rich with layering.  </li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>Wish Maybelline would make a lighter color (or a more compatible color) for brown hair dyed a red color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>But much to my delight, I found it--and ordered 10.  </li>
      <li>and this really enhances them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Also is good as a soft, smokey eyeliner; I just have to use a wet Q-tip to get it to the right color intensity (because it&#x27;s so dark).</li>
      <li>This shadow is very pigmented and can be layered for light to heavy color.  </li>
      <li>Looks very natural.</li>
      <li>Not too light or not too dark.</li>
      <li>Being a redhead with hazel eyes wearing this with outher close colors really helps bring out the blue in my eyes.</li>
      <li>Exactly the color I wanted and packaged carefully!</li>
      <li>--brown hair dyed a soft red.</li>
      <li>I recommend this brand to everyone who wants deep color and long lasting color.</li>
      <li>It goes on very dark so use caution on your first application.</li>

<li> Difficult to find this shade of brown,</li>

    <li> Being a redhead with hazel eyes wearing this with outher close colors really helps bring out the blue in my eyes. I love that the chic naturals has so many close color options mattes and shimmers.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years as a powder eyeliner. The color works perfectly for my eye color.  Love it! I was thrilled to find it online.</li>
    <li> Love it....couldn&#x27;t find in store!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow, deep and rich color in my favorite shade. I recommend this brand to everyone who wants deep color and long lasting color.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow is my favorite of all I have tried. Please keep it available.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colour, and nice even coverage.  Great for a smoky eye look.</li>
    <li> It was great.  This color is hard to find so let me know if you get more</li>
    <li> I have ordered this more than once and love the color.  Look forward to ordering again when my current supply runs out..[</li>
    <li> I was very happy to have found this item. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Exactly the color I wanted and packaged carefully!</li>
    <li> I love this color for fading on eyelids with the gold color on lids.  Last a long time as well.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect color to make my green eyes pop! I use it as a liner sometimes, and as a lid crease color too.</li>
    <li> I have olive skin, and it&#x27;s too dark alone, so I put it over a ballet-pink base shadow. It comes out the perfect shade that way--a soft rosy brown--and I can then wet it with a dampened makeup sponge. Looks very natural. Also is good as a soft, smokey eyeliner; I just have to use a wet Q-tip to get it to the right color intensity (because it&#x27;s so dark). I&#x27;ve literally been searching years for the right raisin/plum shadow, and this appears to be it. It&#x27;s matte, rich, and lasting--like an expensive shadow. I got mine at Wal-Mart, but it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s available on Amazon. I especially like it with the Neutrogena Vintage Wines eyeshadow quad (also at WM or on Amazon).</li>
    <li> Great Makeup! Fast delivery! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great Color on Tan skin</li>
    <li> The quality of Maybelline&#x27;s eyeshadows  can&#x27;t be beat.  Lovely brown color in a matte color.  Not too light or not too dark.</li>
    <li> I love this matte, velvet&#x27;y shadow. Its a beautifully pigmented Eggplant/Brown color. It goes on very dark so use caution on your first application. I use this only on my lids and Lancome Color Design hghlighter &#x27;Filigree&#x27; on browbone.. very beautiful when you smoke it out w/ Black liner. I have Olive skin and dark brown eyes and this really enhances them.&lt;br /&gt;This has been discontinued but occasionally it pops up at discount Dollar stores. In the meantime, Lancome Color Design &#x27;Fashion Label&#x27; matches almost identically.</li>
    <li> Great shade of brown with just the right amount of rosy color.  Goes on lightly, if applied correctly, but can get really rich with layering.  Stays on all day.  I also use this color to line bottom lashes with lining brush.  Difficult to find this shade of brown, so... LOVE you, Maybelline!</li>
    <li> LOve it...Just my color!!</li>
    <li> I also use it for my brows.  Wish Maybelline would make a lighter color (or a more compatible color) for brown hair dyed a red color.&lt;br /&gt; I used this Nutmeg color because I couldn&#x27;t find- Light brown 598UB-10--lighter and a perfect color.  Maybeline discontinued.  But much to my delight, I found it--and ordered 10.  Nutmeg way too dark for me--brown hair dyed a soft red.</li>
    <li> This shadow is very pigmented and can be layered for light to heavy color.  It lasts well without creasing.  It is a basic chocolate brown color with yellow undertones.  No blue or purple or red tone can be discerned.  It blends well with other colors if you want to customize.</li>
