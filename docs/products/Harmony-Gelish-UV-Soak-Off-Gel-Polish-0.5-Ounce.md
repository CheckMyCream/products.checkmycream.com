<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this for a white polish in the fall. It wears great. Much better than the white hard gel.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. 2 coats work just fine for French manicures.</li>
    <li> Love Gelish! This is perfect white for French tip, I like the fun colors too BUTfrench is always safe color...it matches EVERYTHING!</li>
    <li> The Gelish - Sheek White, is just the color I expected, really white, great for a french manicure and you can pair it with any of the gelish colors for designs and accents, but I generally use it for my frenchs. I did put 2-3 coats to make sure I get a real uniform white color.</li>
    <li> It is white however it is a little more thing and sheer than I expected. I did a french manicure on my toenails, and it chipped sooner than the other shellac on my fingernails which I&#x27;m much rougher with! It could have been my mistake, painting it wrong but I was somewhat disappointed. However, I do not regret my purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like this nail polish.  It is easy to put on and hardens in two minutes!  Really you can do anything in two minutes!  The only thing that prevents me from giving it five stars is that it does take awhile to soak it off...longer than putting it on!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect color for those wanting to have a long-lasting french manicure. It just adds one more step to the Gelish process, so maybe it takes 5-7 minutes longer than a typical mianicure -- but so worth it!    This white is PURE white, so you will only need one coat.    One pointer, though - when painting the white tips, paint one hand then process it under the UV or LED light, then do the other hand. Otherwise, the white tends to spread out beyond the tips if you wait to process it.</li>
    <li> goes on quickly and no need for multiple applications. This is a great white</li>
    <li> This is the best white gel polish I&#x27;ve used for french tips.  I would highly recommend it, it works GREAT!!</li>
    <li> Pure white, cured well, and was exactly as expected. I failed miserably at doing my own french manicure, but that was my lack of skill nothing to do with this product. Fortunately white nail polish has been in this year so I was able to still wear it.</li>
    <li> I love all the Gelish polishes and this one is no different. I have had a slight problem with it separating which hasn&#x27;t happened with any of my other colors but it&#x27;s easily remedied by shaking the bottle.</li>
    <li> Did a French Manicure for m-i-l a few weeks ago, she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I did two coast of Bashful color (almost clear) and then&lt;br /&gt;dry brushed the smile line and applied two coats smile of&lt;br /&gt;Sleek White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thin enough that it is easy to work with, and thick enough&lt;br /&gt;that 2 coats creates white opaque for tips. All Gelish polishes&lt;br /&gt;self level so imperfections in your application will even out&lt;br /&gt;if you give it a few seconds before curing. Easiest tip color&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ever done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to apply this thinly beneath light color polishes&lt;br /&gt;that are not as opaque as I&#x27;d like - I think it should \\&quot;white-out\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;and provide a nice base to build light colors on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Gelish polishes - quick UV cured gel that is hard as nails and&lt;br /&gt;helps protect mine while they grow out from past acrylic enhancements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;French Manicure Gelish combinations I&#x27;ve tried so far:&lt;br /&gt;Bashful/Sleek White &#x3D; clear shiny base / white tip&lt;br /&gt;Ivory Coast/Sleek White &#x3D; light tan base / white tip&lt;br /&gt;Light Elegant /Sleek White &#x3D; Pale Pink Shimmer base / white tip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I bought this to make design(peacock on light pink - Pink Smoothie with silver - Water Field) on nails. Pure white, good constancy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this gel nail polish through Amazon.  It is the perfect color of white to use for a french manicure.  Very happy with this vendor.</li>
    <li> Two coats really makes for a nice white smile on fingernail tips.    I have on right now a French Manicure of one coat of June Bride and 2 coats of Sleek White at the tip. Shimmery and elegant!     Tip: In order for the white not to bleed into the rest of the base coat, i wipe the tip where i am going to paint my white with a paper towel to remove the tackiness. I also use a small paper towel strip that i fold and roll into a triangle and use the tip of the triangle to shape and wipe off the rest of the stray white at the base coat to form a perfect smile tip.    I read somewhere that the tackiness helps the next coat of polish to adhere but i found out that is not the case.    Try my pointer and people will think a professional nail tech did your nails.</li>
    <li> Gelish is a great product! The only thing about this color is that if you are using as a tip color it is a bit runnier so you have to apply a thin coat each time so the smile line is clean.</li>
    <li> I really like this color for french tips. It is a thin white color that does spread easily.  I do not use the sheer color that I purchased, my coats get too thick.  I let the foundation be the full nail covering.  Here is the process I use.  Step 1: Apply foundation and cure the same length of time as a color so it really sets up.    Step 2: I apply a very thin and see-through coat of the white as a much bigger tip than I want it for the french tip.  Also do the edges of the tip.  Step 3: I go back with a itty-bitty art brush that I dip in plain old water.  I just get the bristles wet, not drippy.  I dab off any extra liquid because I just want a flexible brush to pick up the extra white I spread around.  I first pick it up from the nail, letting the tacky layer pull hard against the brush while I swipe the smile line. Then dab the brush off before I continue to the next nail.   Step 4: I check the cuticles and under the tips to be sure I picked up all the stray paint with my art brush or an orange stick.  I final check all the smile lines to be sure I&#x27;m happy with their uniform shape.  If I don&#x27;t like one, I use the art brush to pull off all the white and re-apply.    Step 5: Then I cure in the light for a full color time.   REPEAT for a solid white tip.  Remember, the coats should be very thin. You&#x27;ll be suprised how the second coat really makes it a nice solid white even though it is very thin. Don&#x27;t go too thick or you will see bubles and fat tips that peal off!    POINTER #1: Cotton-balls are your enemy. I keep them away from my nail kit because every little particle or fuzzy shows up on your nails as glossy mountains! I find that the art brush is really handy for picking up any clingy fibers and flakes!   Pointer #2: Save the wine to celebrate after your nails are finsihed...I&#x27;ve made the mistake of starting that before french tips and it didn&#x27;t turn out well. :*)</li>
    <li> This white is too loose, cant make French design with it :( And if you dont use it for a while it gets (dono how to say in english) separated on white and some yellow clear liquid in the bottle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other colors i used are great.</li>
    <li> This sheek white color is perfect for a French tip manicure. it looks great with just a top coat. Love it!</li>
    <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an artist who&#x27;s been painting her nails&lt;br /&gt;for quite some time, though. If this happens to&lt;br /&gt;be the case for someone buying the Gelish set,&lt;br /&gt;it takes a lot of practice to get used to this&lt;br /&gt;procedure, especially for a French.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to save money and do it myself. I bought the:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Foundation&lt;br /&gt;2. Ph Bond&lt;br /&gt;3. Sleek White&lt;br /&gt;4. Top It Off&lt;br /&gt;5. Nourish - which smells AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my moms UV light which was great&lt;br /&gt;that I didn&#x27;t have to buy. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s so&lt;br /&gt;old that I don&#x27;t know how strong the bulb is so&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty much guessing on cure times.&lt;br /&gt;There are just a cople French Gelish Manicure videos&lt;br /&gt;on YouTube but I wish there were more. I am having such&lt;br /&gt;a hard time making the white perfect on myself. I even&lt;br /&gt;recently bought self-adhesive reinforcement circles&lt;br /&gt;to help make the line more perfect. We&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
    <li> I used this color to do the tips on my french manicure with bashful.  It came out amazing and did not chip for over two weeks.  I ended up taking it off because I got bored and wanted to change colors.  I love Gelish!</li>
    <li> This white color is a little too watery but it works fairly well for French manicures. A thick coat bubbles up when curing in the UV lamp.</li>
    <li> Great for French Manicure.  I really like the Harmony Gelish.  It lasts for several weeks. Looks nice. Cures fast with the UV light.</li>
    <li> Love it that my french manicure came out so great the first time! I have been using this line of GEL POLISHES now for 3 months and could not be HAPPIER!! I love all the color choices.  I also love its durability and how easy it is to put on and take off.  ONLY follow the YOU TUBE video on how to apply Gelish that is done by HARMONY.  There are other ppl who have put out their own YOU TUBE videos on how to apply it, however they have you curing the gels for 1-3 minutes each time...and according to the HARMONY GELISH TUTORIAL VIDEO on YOU TUBE...that is NOT necessary.  I have followed the Harmony video with great results now for 3 months! TAKE YOUR TIME when applying and with a little practice, you will be just as pleased as I am! Wishing you beautiful sexy nails!!</li>
    <li> My first Gelish experience was for my sister&#x27;s wedding a year ago... the salon suggested and performed the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; I was so in love with the results, but could never bring myself to keep up the salon expense...  Finally jumped in and bought the system - Love!!!  No harder than a regular polish manicure and fantastic results... I used Sheek White tips over the base with no other color, just the top coat.  I painted on the white from mid nail to tip and wiped away the crescent shape with a small makeup brush dipped in non acetone remover...  I found no problem with the thinness mentioned if 2 coats are done...  and I love the super clean, glossy look!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really in love with these products after just one use!  Used the white polish for a french manicure and it looks great!</li>
    <li> I Recently order the sleek white as \\&quot;SLEEK WHITE\\&quot; 01323 as shown in the pictures however when I received the package it said \\&quot;SHEEK WHITE\\&quot; which makes it a fake version of the real version of Harmony Gelish. It not as thick as the actual gelish making it difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> Using 2 coats gets me a soft-looking white for french tips, but it is not opaque initially, and is a pale white, not a hard contrast. I like it with Sweet Dreams for a very natural, almost faded look.</li>
    <li> I use this color as the tip for a French Manicure with the gellish product. At the beginning there is a learning curve to this because you want to do real thin coats throughout the whole gellish process. After about three times of applying I have finally gotten them to last for 2 weeks. I would advise getting Sally Hansen UV top coat to freshen up the manicure after about 5 days. I think that this extends the life of the manicure and freshens it up from normal scuffing and scraping of your nail if your an active person. I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to any person instead of the other products that are much more expensive. This product last up to three weeks. The trick is to make sure you cure the product more time. It usually says 2 min. but I do 3.5 mins on each coat, and it wont chip. Get color for the french manicure look!</li>
    <li> A very opaque white, great for mixing to make more pastel versions of my other Gelish colors.</li>
    <li> for some reason all of my other gel nail polishes work just fine...no problem. this brand was the cheapest and I use it for french tips and it literally peels off in 1 or 2 days. I don&#x27;t understand. I have attempted it multiple times and same results every time. really annoying.</li>
    <li> Works great with my gel system. Used this for french tips. Going to try some polka dots like others tried in the pics.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great color for decorating...I got it for the 4th of July nails, and it worked great. Love it...</li>
    <li> I only gave it 4 stars, because it is so difficult to apply a french manicure by yourself. I was partially aware of that , watched several youtube videos,but it will take a lot of more practice to get it right.  It would be nice if for the high price they would supply a brush to fix the french manicure, I went ahead and purchased one seperately from amazon.   Nothing really wrong with the product, just a tiny bottle ! but it should last for a long time, like I said just make sure you are willing to learn and spend enough time doing your own french.  Was thinking about going for just one all over color, but could not find one to match, but now I have the whole UV kit, gelish kit and will just hang in there and try to make it work. Just be aware that it all is not as easy at first as you think it is to make it look as perfect as the salons  UPDATE: took the product to my nail salon, I was advised something must be wrong with the one I got, it is way to liquid, nothing compared to the same brand and color they have in the store.  Requested a refund from the seller, and will definitely leave the gel nail application to the professionals</li>
    <li> This is by far the best white polish I&#x27;ve used. It goes on so easily that I don&#x27;t need to touch up after I&#x27;ve applied it.  It&#x27;s the best manicure I&#x27;ve gotten and lasts at least 2 weeks chip free!</li>
    <li> I love to have great looking nail but I do not want to keep paying for something that I have to keep getting fixed. I can do my own nail so this is while I added this product as an additional to my nail collection and I am so happy for this product.</li>
    <li> I have order a lot of gel products from u and the sheik white on is the worst product I ever received its very watery and runs all over your nail when using when your able to clean it up and cure it its very streaky and uneven color no matter how many coats u put on</li>
    <li> Pretty streaky - not sure if this one has been tampered with or not, but I can&#x27;t use the color because its too watery/streaky.</li>
    <li> I received the item promptly and am very pleased. The store was easy to work with, and product works great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this color to do a french manicure.  It was exactly what I expected.  Good coverage and consistency.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have several Gelish polishes and have never had trouble like I did with this one.  The color is so thin that it runs off the nail right after you apply it.  It also is separated and has a lot of yellow to it.  I suspect I got a really old bottle and am really disappointed.  13 bucks down the drain since it is just going in the trash.  If you order I would recommend NOT ordering from Beauty Shine as their stock may be really dated.  Otherwise I love Gelish products!</li>
    <li> Nice white polish.  it goes on evenly and looks great with 2 coats of polish.  I have used this color many times and it always looks great.  it would also serve well for french tips!</li>
    <li> Very nice white!  I did my first French manicure on my sister today and this white was very nice.  It&#x27;s a good white that can be soft or bright depending on the number of coats you apply.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a great long lasting gel polish. To get a solid white color for nail bed or for tips you need at least two coats. But overall great product! Very happy!</li>
    <li> I use this white for my french manicures, absolutely fabulous with Little Princess!!Will buy again and again and always share my delight with Harmony and the prices on Amazon with my friends!!!</li>
    <li> I thought that arctic freeze was a good white, this one is even better. Application is a bit easier then arctic freeze as well, which can tend to be a little thick..this one goes on perfect. It is a nice bright white.</li>
    <li> I use Gelish products and Opi and have been very happy with them but I guess I got an old bottle this time. I used the Sheek White for my french manicure (same brand used by my manicurist) but it was much thinner and very hard to control. Had to use my clean-up brush ALOT. Even after two coats it&#x27;s very pale and uneven. Will probably buy from a different supplier next time.</li>
    <li> this product was as expected.  fast shipping, great price. It did go thick after one month.  But overall it worked for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great white for French tip! It is opaque with 2 coats. Always comes in brand new condition and applies great!</li>
    <li> Very nice Opaque color.  Covers in 1 coat even over red or bright colors.  cures well. no issues.  better deal than at sally&#x27;s</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect white it just is kinda runny and wrinkles when cured in UV light, other than that i like it.</li>
    <li> I bought Sleek White to use with my gel light (see my other reviews for a how-to) and it worked like a charm. It went on smooth and I only needed 1 coat of white. I did this (see photos) freehand and it worked great. I did put it on too think on a couple of nails so it rippled after it cured under the light. But, after using the Gelish topcoat,[[ASIN:B006KLDLIG Harmony Gelish Top-it-off \\&quot;Top Coat Gel .5oz\\&quot; Ship Now]] the rippled smoothed out. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I used the Sheek White for a French manicure for my wedding day.  I used two coats Sheek White for the tips and used one coat of Champagne over the base of my nails and tips.  For my accent finger, I made arches with two small rows of yellow rhinestones.  My colors were ivory and pastel yellow and my nails were perfect!!  The Sheek White is thinner than the Arctic Freeze, but two coats worked well.</li>
    <li> The polish went on nicely, however I noticed that it almost turned a little yellowish after a few days. It started to chip, none of my other Gelish polishes chipped so I dont know why it did.</li>
    <li> Get exactly what you order!</li>
    <li> I have many bottles of Gelish polish, and love them all.  Except Sleek White.  For some reason, this seems much thinner and runnier than other colors.  It&#x27;s hard to control and goes on streaky.  It takes a minimum of two coats to get an even, smooth application.  If you are using it for french tips, this can cause a ridge at the end of the nail which can be hard to smooth out.  It wears as well as other Gelish colors, but not happy with the application.</li>
    <li> The colors are really good I really like this product.  I would suggest Gelish product for all people that want to use gel nail polish</li>
    <li> I got this polish to do tips and it worked well. I did some nail art and painted my whole nail white. but after a few days, it started chipping. I have my hands in water a lot and that may have a lot to do with it, though.</li>
    <li> It came right on time and I used it for a french manicure and it was just awesome!  I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase and I will definitely be ordering another one.</li>
    <li> I think this is a perfect color for the white tips in a French manicure.  I don&#x27;t do my own French manicures any more - my hands aren&#x27;t steady enough.  My usual manicurist does a great careful job, but the only white color he uses is the brighter white (e.g., Arctic White), which looks like Whiteout with my coloring and stands out too much.  I like a softer more natural look.  After doing some research on colors, I bought a bottle of the Sheek White and took it with me for my last manicure.  I think it&#x27;s fabulous.  Note: my manicurist doesn&#x27;t like it because he thinks it&#x27;s boring.  He likes bright colors and fancy designs, so my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; French manicure is not his style, but he can write his own review :-).</li>
    <li> Not terribly exciting- just a plain white. However, it does apply nicely with full coverage after 1-2 coats (depending on how thick you apply). I&#x27;ve had it wrinkle once in curing, but for the most part it has been a good color. This one is definitely my &#x27;go to&#x27; for French manicures. I paint the tips, then use a brush dipped in alcohol to form a nice line, cure, and I&#x27;m set!</li>
    <li> Painting your nails white is hot right now. I have noticed in fashion magazines and on TV that white nails are back. I am a fan of Gelish polishes and was pleased with this white polish. I had previously had French manicures at salons and was disappointed in them because they seemed to chip and did not last as long as when I got a color. I used this polish on my entire nail after using the ph bond , and foundation. I then applied the clear top coat using the light between coats of course. It looks beautiful, especially with a summer tan and it lasted as long as the colors that I have purchased.</li>
    <li> i pretty much only use this color for french tips (which i do a lot) and it is perfect - it isn&#x27;t a stark white but also doesn&#x27;t look dirty for french tips.  it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> loves this color and she really loves the gel as she does not have to do her nails every few days, more like every few weeks now.</li>
    <li> horrible product .this gel polish comes out very thin and yellow. hopefully the seller will replace!</li>
    <li> Bottle was overfilled , very running . Had to run over to Sally&#x27;s and get a mini , it&#x27;s been fine .</li>
    <li> ended up not using it.  Too bad!</li>
    <li> Bought this white to go with red and blue glitter for 4th of july, my nails lasted all week up north and looked very festive.</li>
    <li> I JUST LOVE IT! IT WORKS GREAT BUT YOU NEED TO USE AS INSTRUCTED!! WORKS GREAT WITH LED LIGHT. YOU CAN FIND VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS ON THE GELISH WEBSITE OR YOUTUBE. IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS, IT WILL WORK FOR YOU TOO! MY NAILS ARE ALWAYS BEAUTIFULL AND THE LED LAMP AND THE COMPLETE KIT PAID FOR ITSELF IN ONE OR TWO MONTHS DEPENDIGN HOW OFTEN YOU GET YOUR NAIL DONE. WHATCH THE VIDEOS IF YOU ARE NEW TO SOAK OF GEL POLISH.</li>
    <li> This is a very thin white, it is good if that is what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> This polish peeled off after a day or two. I have other polishes from the manufacture and they last up to two weeks.</li>
    <li> I like this. Be noted though that this isn&#x27;t going to be a stark, crisp, in your face white. It&#x27;s more of a natural looking white. I like it. The only reason this didn&#x27;t get five stars is because after awhile it starts to separate some in the bottle. I am pleased with it, and am happy with the seller. Will probably repurchase when the time comes when I need a replacement. Can&#x27;t beat the prices for gel polish on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Great for a french manicure, but if used alone, appears streaky.  I have used it a few times for a base coat under very pale gelish colors, and that works really well also.</li>
    <li> This is pretty but it needs 3 apps to not be see through. I love the brand, but didnt particularly like this color.</li>
    <li> I describe as brite, cloud white, pure, and simple.... does not look chalky like white paint. I would definitely recommend this to others</li>
    <li> I recieved this for a gel kit and it works really well for french tips...Perfect white color and goes on easy and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using gelish for about a year now and I normally just do a color nail polish. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the french manicure by gelish for some time now and I&#x27;m glad I did. This is the perfect white to do this. I read through other reviews to make my decision and I&#x27;m glad I took their advice. It does need about 2 coats to become the perfect white. Make sure you apply it in thin layers because it tends to bubble up a bit. I put a foundation gel first, then cure it, then one coat of white, clean it up with brush, cure it, then another coat, clean it up with brush and then cure it again.Then I put Simply Sheer over the top and cure it again. I also use the Top coat by gelish for this.</li>
    <li> I love my purchase. Gelish nail polish works the best and is so expensive in stores.. This is a good deal.</li>
    <li> This is the prefect white for you french manicure I used the snow bunny which is a more natural white and is pretty as well but if you want a white that pops a little more for your french manicure this is the white to get!</li>
    <li> Great product, the way it goes on, not leaky. Easy to work with. The only problem is removal. I am still in search for the product that removes easily. Also it seems to get dirty fast if you use light colors.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT.  Get a lot more for your money.  Sally sells bottles half the size for same amount of money.  Will always buy here</li>
    <li> Excelent product and delivery on time</li>
    <li> Separated and turned a little yellow. Also seemed to be a little runny. I ordered their Artic White and was much happier with it.</li>
    <li> this is a beautiful color but i think there is something wrong with it. I did my nails like I always do and 4 of 10 fell off the next day. disappointed</li>
    <li> Great quality polish, competitive price, just as described.  Nice to do my own french manicures at home with a UV light.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect shad of white for french manicures.  Please be sure to apply lightly as this is a bit on the runny side of the gelish polish and as many reviewers have said, a thin application is an absolute necessity.</li>
    <li> One coat was all I needed to apply to my nails, but I did add a second one to obtain thicker coverage.  I had many compliments on this, yet its just white.</li>
    <li> I have the lamp and I use this white to make the French Nails. It goes on smooth and lasts for weeks once you get it on.&lt;br /&gt;I highly rcommend this to anyone who&#x27;s tired of paying so much for a manicure. The first time I did my nails with it, it took a while to get it on correctly. Now I have no problems. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Streaky. takes 3 coats.</li>
    <li> These gel polishes are great. You have to use a UV light in between coats or they do not dry.</li>
    <li> Gelish was the first brand that I started with when I started using SOG and it&#x27;s worked fairly well for me.  I do have a few issues of chipping/peeling on my dominant hand but I&#x27;m thinking that is user error.  They say to use a very thin layer but I think perhaps my layers have been too thin.  Once I started making the layer more thick, my wear issues reduced.  As for the color itself, this is a white that I use for my french manicures.  I like a really white french so for me it could be slightly whiter but it&#x27;s pretty good.  I use Gelish Little Princess with it on my french and that&#x27;s the perfect pink for it, in my opinion.  I have also used the white as an under layer to brighten up or make another color more opaque.  I&#x27;ve even used it mixed with another (Gelish only) color to change colors.  I do this on a piece of aluminum foil or in a dampen dish.  So, it&#x27;s a very versatile color...which is good b/c I purchased 2 by accident!</li>
    <li> I thought since it was called sleek white that maybe it would be a little pearly but it doesn&#x27;t. It looks like paint on my fingers. It could&#x27;ve been whiter too cuz when i put Vegas Nights over it then it turned a greenish/yellow tint. I should&#x27;ve got artic white. But hey at least i have white.</li>
    <li> Very good as I expected !!! Will soon order again  !</li>
    <li> Perfect for a French Manicure :) Also looks great as a solid color on nails. Use 2 coats minimum though if you are doing the whole nail.</li>
    <li> I use this white to do french manicure, polka dots and also to cover the entire nail with and it is perfect. I recommend it if you want a brighter white than \\&quot;Snow Bunny\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought this product knowing it may not be genuine due to the name of the color SHEEK white vs SLEEK white a listed on Harmony Gelish website. I used 2 coats as French tip, easy to apply (not thick), no problem curing with LED lamp, no chip for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a link for all Gelish colors. Notice that color name is different from this Amazon listing&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Strong white color.  It was had to tell on line, the difference between Artic white and sheek white.  Artic white has a little gray cast in it.  Sheek white is just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I just bought my UV light and Harmony Gelish High Voltage, Tiger Blossom and Sheek White polishes and I could not love them more. Reason why I give this a four star though is because on the Sheek White the color window shows a gray color. I even pulled the sticker back to see if that was what was making it gray and it was still gray. I haven&#x27;t used it on my nails yet as I have High Voltage on right now but I did test it out on a nail like surface and it was indeed white. When you pull the brush out it also looks white so I don&#x27;t get it. My order was filled through Beauty Shine so maybe you will want to try to go through a different vendor. When I use it though I&#x27;ll make sure to come back and post how it turned out.</li>
    <li> This is a good pure white, I use 2 coats to obtain opaque white. It has a nail polish like consistency. No complaints from me. :)</li>
    <li> It is not a full, solid white. It applies streaky and you have to do several coats to get a pure white color otherwise your nails look &#x27;faded&#x27;. Disappointing since Gelish does not have any other pure white nail colors for a good french manicure.</li>
    <li> Much larger size than I had been receiving at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply so pretty stoked :D same price as the minis with the same quality.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly well.  Not streaky, super opaque and white</li>
    <li> Decent white gel polish. Not the most opaque and does streak a bit, however it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these items.  I t is saving me bunches of money/  I even do my families and friends nails for a small fee.</li>
    <li> Some reviews said it was super thin but I prefer that so when I do my french manicures it doesn&#x27;t get super thick just on the tip of my nail.  Great purchase.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great color for French or to nail art. It goes on easily. If you make a mistake easy to clean and reapply.</li>
    <li> When this product is used for the white tips in a french manicure, only one thin coat is needed to make it look natural.  This polish makes the french manicure look absolutely stunning!  I love Gelish!</li>
    <li> Love the gelish system. I used this color as my French tip white. I only used 1 coat for my tips &amp; it was just enough to enhance my natural French tip nails.</li>
    <li> This is much larger than what I have bought from the store and was almost the same price! I really lie it. It&#x27;s a bit thinker than what I&#x27;m used to, but I just brushed less. I will buy more!!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love a french manicure, but geesh, they only last a day or two...until Gelish. Two weeks of life in a tidy french manicure. I&#x27;m a fan of the whole line, actually.</li>
    <li> Universal colour which lasts and looks fresh for over a week. My best colour.</li>
    <li> this is a great white to use on the tips for a french manicure - you can also soften it a bit by just taking a a drop of it, placing it on something nonporeous and adding another drop of a light pink or whatever - because it is a gelish polish it will not really dry out while it sits</li>
    <li> Having my own White Gel Nail Polish allows me to do my own French Tips (saves me money).  This color, along with the other colors I&#x27;ve order, is great to have.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone doing their own nails. I have used this color beofre doing French tips and it works well.</li>
    <li> This color is just right.  Not too chalky looking and white enough to stand out without looking really fake. My clients like it.</li>
    <li> Perfect white for french tips or for under a water marbling color. cant wait to try it with other colors and tips</li>
    <li> Perfect color for doing your own french manicure look at home. Pairs great with Harmony Simply Sheer Polish. Love the look!</li>
    <li> I love IBD polishes for color. This is a nice white. You HAVE to shake this bottle for a few minutes before use. I find that to be true of any white polish or paint. It will come out streaky if you do not shake it properly. If mixed well, it goes on great! White is a tough color to use in general.</li>
    <li> DID NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO USE.</li>
    <li> I bought this polish to do French tips gel polish on my nails. It turned out perfect! It&#x27;s so nice to have a French manicure that lasts weeks and weeks! Without having to get those acrylic fake nails. I found out that if you do double base coats and double top costs it will last longer if your just doing color in the tips instead of over the whole nail. I have ordered several polishes from the Payless nail supply and I&#x27;ve been happy with everything every time!</li>
    <li> Shipping is very fast! Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;However, hopefully it is real Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Passion, because I do know why the nail shop gave me a manicure once a month by using the Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Passion, which can be holden  perfect well more than a month, but when I did a  manicure by myself at home by using this ordered products , which  can able to hold it less than three days.</li>
    <li> I like the color, but after a while it started to look dirty or used. It may be the chemicals I work around, but I am not sure</li>
    <li> I have not tried this color out yet but it is white very nice. Looking forward to trying the French Manicure.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty opaque color.  I am very happy with this purchase and the price I paid for the item.</li>
    <li> I have used this for simple french manicures, nail art and as a base for nail art and I have never been disappointed. The color is true and it hardens under the lamp as it should. The amount you get is a great deal for most stores charge this price for 1/4 the amount of product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a truly white gelish color and this one is perfect for french manicure, I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love all the Gelish products.  I have many of their products and I have never had a problem!</li>
    <li> great polish for gel nails. Cheapest place to buy it and shipping was quick. I love gel nails and I love doing them at home myself even more!</li>
    <li> White is white. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, I would guess there is a huge learning curve to do French nails , but I am willing to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Love it, just wanted I needed. I will buy again, alot cheaper from buy in store. Hope the buyer has more colors.</li>
    <li> Gelish products are definitely the best when doing gel nails and this sleek white is nice a bright for the french manicure.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
