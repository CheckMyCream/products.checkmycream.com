### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>This is the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>This is the best floss.</li>
      <li>The best floss I have ever used.</li>
      <li>It is the best floss out there.</li>
      <li>Great Dealer.</li>
      <li>It stretches, so doesn&#x27;t cut off the circulation in your fingers while flossing, yet does a great job.</li>
      <li>Great for arthritis fingers.  </li>
      <li>Great price for a great product.</li>
      <li>This leads to superior performance.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite floss ever!</li>
      <li>My wife likes this kind.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent floss that doesn&#x27;t snap or break between my very close together teeth.</li>
      <li>Reach&#x27;s superior performance makes it worthwhile.</li>
      <li>My favorite floss.  </li>
      <li>but with much better results.</li>
      <li>I love this floss.  </li>
      <li>I can no longer find it in any of our local department and grocery stores, and am very happy to be able to purchase it here,</li>
      <li>One of my two favorite flosses.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more flexible.</li>
      <li>Thus, it covers more surface area and is easier to hold.&lt;br</li>
      <li>hope they redesign the container with the cap on top - that closes.</li>
      <li>I love the floss.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, why would they design the cap to be at the bottom where it could pick up so many germs from the counter, moisture, etc.</li>
      <li>Best floss for tight spaces.</li>
      <li>I also find it works as smoothly as the tape or \\&quot;Glide\\</li>
      <li>It is now the only kind I will ever buy again!</li>
      <li>I called the manufacturer and found out this was rebranded and is now called listerine ultra clean floss, mint.  </li>
      <li>This is the best floss to use if you have the issue of it either getting stuck on dental work or have hard areas to floss through.</li>
      <li>Really gets your teeth clean!</li>
      <li>Well worth a try</li>
      <li>exactly right or keep changing your grip.</li>
      <li>The rough surface is also better at material removal than smooth waxed</li>
      <li>I first learned about this floss from my Dentist.</li>
      <li>I was using this floss along with the regular Reach floss, but now I&#x27;m using this stretch one more and more.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, I look first at Amazon for all my routine purchases...and the savings per year pay for the Prime membership...</li>
      <li>My favorite floss until now was the woven, thread like floss by J&amp;J/Reach, but Total Care is now in the lead.</li>
      <li>This may not seem like much at first, but the stretchyness means that you do not have to get the length</li>
      <li>Best so far but not perfect.</li>
      <li>Who knew I would like floss so much that I would write a review?</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying this product.  </li>
      <li>Both the floss and the mouth rinse are very rare finds in local stores.  </li>
      <li>This floss however gives a little since it has elasticity, but is still very very strong and resists shearing.</li>
      <li>Great dental floss; slightly expensive but is wider than most others and does a great job; got sample from my dentist; very hard to find other than on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is the only stuff that works good in getting through the tight gaps i have between my molars.  </li>
      <li>Reach Total Care Floss costs more than standard dental flosses.</li>
      <li>Gentle on the gums, too (mine are sensitive).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thin and stretchy, does not break easily, and does a fabulous job, without &amp;#34;waxing&amp;#34; your teeth.</li>
      <li>And, the large size of the Breath Rx does not exist in any of our stores... and the large size at Amazon is about the same price as half the size at drug stores/discount stores.  </li>
      <li>Gets the gunk out, gets in tight spaces, and rarely breaks.</li>
      <li>The only other floss i&#x27;ve had success with is the Glide floss.  </li>
      <li>It will have to do until the old Glide makes a come back!</li>

<li> It seems to have a little less in the container than the other floss, but I also realized that you don&#x27;t need as much floss compared to other floss.</li>

<li> Item is hard to find in local stores, usually sold out...</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t catch on any dental work or shred like the woven floss and scrubs teeth just as well, if not better.</li>
<li> Disappointed when Glide changed their formula and the the new Glide floss would break every time.</li>
<li> Very hard to find in my area.</li>
<li> Too expensive.  </li>
<li> But the worst part is that the cap will NOT stay closed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only way to floss</li>
    <li> Great dental floss; slightly expensive but is wider than most others and does a great job; got sample from my dentist; very hard to find other than on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Item is hard to find in local stores, usually sold out... my purchase was for (2)small size Reach Floss and (2)Breath Rx alcohol-free mouth rinse in the giant size.  Both the floss and the mouth rinse are very rare finds in local stores.  And, the large size of the Breath Rx does not exist in any of our stores... and the large size at Amazon is about the same price as half the size at drug stores/discount stores.  So, I look first at Amazon for all my routine purchases...and the savings per year pay for the Prime membership... what could be easier?</li>
    <li> My favorite floss.  Gets the gunk out, gets in tight spaces, and rarely breaks.</li>
    <li> I first learned about this floss from my Dentist. It is the best floss out there. Very hard to find in my area. Give it a try. Great Dealer.</li>
    <li> Reach Floss is different from other flosses in several key characteristics. This leads to superior performance. It is a ribbon not a thread. Thus, it covers more surface area and is easier to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surface is rough, i.e. the microgrooves, also making it easier to hold. The rough surface is also better at material removal than smooth waxed surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it stretches. This may not seem like much at first, but the stretchyness means that you do not have to get the length exactly right or keep changing your grip. The length adjusts to your need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one downside: the cost. Reach Total Care Floss costs more than standard dental flosses. However, it is competitive with Oral-B Floss Tape. Reach&#x27;s superior performance makes it worthwhile.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> I called the manufacturer and found out this was rebranded and is now called listerine ultra clean floss, mint.  It&#x27;s $2.79 on drugstore.com.</li>
    <li> I love the floss. No shredding or pulling out of tight spaces.  I was using this floss along with the regular Reach floss, but now I&#x27;m using this stretch one more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is another story....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, why would they design the cap to be at the bottom where it could pick up so many germs from the counter, moisture, etc. But the worst part is that the cap will NOT stay closed. I&#x27;ve been through three containers already and all of them click to shut but then spring open and refuse to stay closed. So since the cap won&#x27;t close, there&#x27;s no way to stand the container on the counter.  It has to lay flat and open and susceptible to microbes.  I&#x27;ve been taping the cap closed and intend to contact Johnson &amp; Johnson about this, but have been too busy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they redesign the container with the cap on top - that closes.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss to use if you have the issue of it either getting stuck on dental work or have hard areas to floss through. It is soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt like other floss can. Well worth a try if you&#x27;ve never used it before. It is now the only kind I will ever buy again!</li>
    <li> This is the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used. Really gets your teeth clean! Gentle on the gums, too (mine are sensitive).</li>
    <li> only floss i ever use.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss. It stretches, so doesn&#x27;t cut off the circulation in your fingers while flossing, yet does a great job.</li>
    <li> I love this floss.  It&#x27;s thin and stretchy, does not break easily, and does a fabulous job, without &amp;#34;waxing&amp;#34; your teeth.</li>

    <li> The best floss I have ever used. Buy it, you will like it</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Too expensive.  J&amp;J used to have a 90yd pkg for half the price--why did they discontinue it?</li>
    <li> My wife likes this kind. For some reason, it&#x27;s always out at the stores.</li>
    <li> Disappointed when Glide changed their formula and the the new Glide floss would break every time. Found this.  Best so far but not perfect. This floss stretches like a tough rubber band but is very resilient. It will have to do until the old Glide makes a come back!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floss ever! I have very tight back teeth and this gets into everything and pulls anything out I think is stuck. It wont shred your gums and leaves a slight mint taste that isnt over whelming. It also DOES NOT SHRED! Thank you reach, forever your flossing friend!</li>
    <li> Great for arthritis fingers.  It&#x27;s more flexible.</li>
    <li> One of my two favorite flosses. Unfortunately, I was notified by J&amp;J that it has been replaced with my most unfavorite Listerine flavor. Guess I&#x27;ll stockpile from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Best floss for tight spaces.</li>
    <li> Thanks for carrying this product.  If your teeth are closely spaced you will appreciate this floss.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that works good in getting through the tight gaps i have between my molars.  The only other floss i&#x27;ve had success with is the Glide floss.  This floss however gives a little since it has elasticity, but is still very very strong and resists shearing.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent floss that doesn&#x27;t snap or break between my very close together teeth. I can no longer find it in any of our local department and grocery stores, and am very happy to be able to purchase it here,</li>
