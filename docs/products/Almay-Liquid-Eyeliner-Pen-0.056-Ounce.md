      <li>I love this easy to apply eyeliner pen.</li>
      <li>Easy to remove.</li>
      <li>Easy to remove.</li>
      <li>Makes for easy and neat application without having to pull eyelids taut.</li>
      <li>Lasts forever and so easy to apply not like some liquid pens.  </li>
      <li>Kudos to Almay for this fine eye marker.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and smears clean easily.  </li>
      <li>Genuine product.</li>
      <li>this is a revolutionary way to apply eyeliner, it is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s about the size of a normal pen</li>
      <li>Easy to use eyeliner but not for the person who wants it to stay all day.  </li>
      <li>I can line my eyes with far greater precision than with a brush applicator.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to many eyeliners and my eyelid tissue is extremely soft.  </li>
      <li>So easy a monkey could do it:)</li>
      <li>Because its like a marker, its very easy to get a nice line as thick as you want to make it.</li>
      <li>thank you for the fast service and the description was right on!</li>
      <li>The shipping was super fast with this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product and it last through an entire work day!</li>
      <li>it helped me to purchase the exact thing that I needed.</li>
      <li>Glad to finally restock.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately I&#x27;ve not been able to locate it in any local store.  </li>
      <li>This is the first liquid eyeliner I have purchased.</li>
      <li>and it stays put exactly the way I want it.  </li>
      <li>This eyeliner is super easy to put on and hit stays put all day long.  </li>
      <li>This eyeliner pen is easy to control and my first one lasted a long time.</li>
      <li>It goes on neatly, and gives a nice soft color....not the deadly black.</li>
      <li>The cap fits quite tightly, which is a good thing, but because the makeup tends to run into the cap a bit, I get it on my hand struggling to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just the nature of all liner pens, or if it&#x27;s how this particular one is made.  </li>
      <li>Then I bought Lancome liner, more expensive but not as smooth as&lt;br /&gt;Almay &amp; they did not have the color brown/black.</li>
      <li>Provides soft, natural definition.  </li>
      <li>this eyeliner is like water paint, barely has color</li>
      <li>Makes a small sharp line, but smears easily.  </li>

    <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve bought.  This eyeliner is super easy to put on and hit stays put all day long.  Beautiful lines, I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Provides soft, natural definition.  Easy to remove.</li>
    <li> Smears, disappeared soon after applying</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this item! I have searched all the local and distant stores in my area and could not find it! thank you for the fast service and the description was right on! it helped me to purchase the exact thing that I needed.</li>
    <li> Great liner.  Will stick with this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brand of eyeliner pen, so I have no basis of comparison.  It&#x27;s fantastic!  I can line my eyes with far greater precision than with a brush applicator.  It goes on smoothly and smears clean easily.  The color looks  awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the tip weeps down the pen a bit.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just the nature of all liner pens, or if it&#x27;s how this particular one is made.  The cap fits quite tightly, which is a good thing, but because the makeup tends to run into the cap a bit, I get it on my hand struggling to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, no complaints at all.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in any stores around me.  Not sure if it was discontinued so I purchased it on Amazon.  Love, love, love it.  Lasts forever and so easy to apply not like some liquid pens.  Color looks great on me.</li>
    <li> The BEST ! this is my favorite eyeliner. Unfortunately I can no longer find it in stores. Goes on like a felt-tip marker and stays put ALL day. Much less messy than regular liquid eyeliner and easier to apply than pencil. You can make it as thin or thick as you like easily. Happy to have found it again!</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner. I cant find it in the store locally for some reason. Because its like a marker, its very easy to get a nice line as thick as you want to make it. Easy to remove.</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast with this product. I love the fact that it&#x27;s about the size of a normal pen and the tip is very fine. It&#x27;s a great product and it last through an entire work day! I love it!</li>
    <li> Makes a small sharp line, but smears easily.  Will probably try a different brand in the future. This is the first liquid eyeliner I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and have been very pleased with it.  Unfortunately I&#x27;ve not been able to locate it in any local store.  I believe it may have been discontinued.  This eyeliner pen is easy to control and my first one lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> First and foremost this was the 1st liquid eyeliner I used months ago, bought it in CVS and loved it. When I went to buy&lt;br /&gt;another one, they don&#x27;t sell it, I tried many places. Then I bought Lancome liner, more expensive but not as smooth as&lt;br /&gt;Almay &amp; they did not have the color brown/black. Thrilled that I can buy it on internet. Great quality, great price and&lt;br /&gt;great color. Love it.</li>
    <li> Genuine product. Received on time.</li>
    <li> Is not permanent...I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  I could have used a kids marker and that would have worked better.  The ink in this eyeliner doesn&#x27;t go on the lower lid at all.  It washes away with the slightest moisture.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore and love the foam tip for application</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and your service.  I will definitely be ordering again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find anything that I like better.  I am allergic to many eyeliners and my eyelid tissue is extremely soft.  This felt-tip liner applies in a gentile stroke without dragging or hurting like pencil liners.  I would like a color somewhere in-between the black-brown and brown.  I wish it would stay on all day but I love it!</li>
    <li> Goes on easier than any other liquid eyeliner I have used.  Stays on all day.  Love the color.  Will reorder.</li>
    <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner I have found.  Can no longer find in the stores.  Glad to finally restock.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes for easy and neat application without having to pull eyelids taut.</li>
    <li> this is a revolutionary way to apply eyeliner, it is fantastic.  I do use a shadow control cream which I apply before the eyeliner and it stays put exactly the way I want it.  thin to thick, exactly how I intend for it to go on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best ever.</li>
    <li> this eyeliner is like water paint, barely has color and if you wanted to wear it out you would prob have to apply it five times</li>
    <li> Easy to use eyeliner but not for the person who wants it to stay all day.  It might need a touch up, but I like it because it is a fine felt tip applicator that is hard to mess up!</li>
    <li> I finally found it. Been looking for it everywhere. This is the one that works and lasts. Appears that they might have stopped making it which I cannot understand.</li>
    <li> I love this easy to apply eyeliner pen. So easy a monkey could do it:)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner. It goes on neatly, and gives a nice soft color....not the deadly black. Kudos to Almay for this fine eye marker. I would buy again and recommend to all.</li>
