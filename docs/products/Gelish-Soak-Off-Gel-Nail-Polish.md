      <li>The &#x60;My Favorite Accessory&#x27; teal polish didn&#x27;t disappoint me.</li>

      <li>My favorite Accessory gel polish is a pretty bright teal.  </li>
      <li>This is a beautiful teal color and completely opaque with 2 coats.</li>
      <li>this color is incredible, great coverage with 2 coats, the pics are very accurate, just one of my favourite colors, no shimmer or pearl, just pure true deep color!</li>
      <li>with other Gelish polishes, I&#x27;m sure the quality is great.</li>
      <li>The color is very fun, almost tropical.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice color, I wear a blue uniform to work, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll wear it a lot.</li>

      <li>This is a very pretty color.</li>

      <li>Fun color, covered well in 2 coats.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite Gelish colors so far.</li>
      <li>This polish seemed just the right consistency.</li>

      <li>The gelish shipped quickly and was packaged very well in bubble wrap.</li>
      <li>and it seems to be very reasonably price compared to its competitors.</li>
      <li>and it was also pretty.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>However, I am always changing my color so I normally don’t go a full two weeks.</li>
      <li>Received order very fast and it was packaged very well.</li>
      <li>very nice color.beautiful coverage with just two thin coats.not blue, not green kind of turquoise.clients</li>
      <li>When I bought this color, it thought it would be more of a teal color, but it is a flat slate blue.</li>
      <li>Its a little bit more darker that the color in the picture.</li>
      <li>I opened it and the color started to spill out, so it&#x27;s not possible for me to say if it was new in the first place.</li>
      <li>I wanted teal blue and this is exactly that.  </li>
      <li>Lasts for weeks and looks fresh and shiny for a long time.</li>
      <li>It flooded the outer bottle and required a lot of tissues to clear it up.</li>
      <li>Make sure that you are applying thin coats to prevent that lumpy look.</li>
      <li>Its like a dark turquoise, you will only need two coats because is very pigmented.</li>

    <li> A truly beautiful color, and looks great with silver or white nail art. One of my favorite Gelish colors so far.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember it was a while ago.</li>
    <li> I really love gelish. I&#x27;ve tried other gel polishes and those don&#x27;t have the same consistency. Gelish always seems to be super easy to put on and is pretty opaque after two layers of color.</li>
    <li> Love this color! Topped it off with Izzy Wizzy Let&#x27;s Get Busy and looked fabulous!</li>
    <li> This is a great teal polish. No glitter or sparkle. Applies evenly in two coats. The color is pretty true to the onscreen swatch. Great for fall.</li>
    <li> This color is just like the picture and goes on well. Very satisfied since colors are not always as they seem when you can&#x27;t see them in person.</li>
    <li> It is a pretty color, but the blue wasn&#x27;t as light or bright as I was hoping it would be.</li>
    <li> Bought this color for something different. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on it. It is different. After putting it on I would describe it as a bluish green color.</li>
    <li> very nice color.beautiful coverage with just two thin coats.not blue, not green kind of turquoise.clients love it.very good for fall.just go for it!!!</li>
    <li> Unlike some gelish colors, I think this is almost identical when applied to the sample photo seen here.  I use so many sparkly or pearly polishes so I wanted to have something different to shake it up from time to time.  This is a beautiful teal color and completely opaque with 2 coats. I also put a sheer glittery color--Izzy Wizzy-- over a few nails, just to try it out and it was also pretty.  I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on it, though I&#x27;d probably use it more in the spring or fall.  I&#x27;m glad I got it, wish I had unlimited funds to buy all the colors!</li>
    <li> This color is perfect for Fall and goes with so many outfits.  It is teal blue in color and only required 2 coats.</li>
    <li> My favorite Accessory gel polish is a pretty bright teal.  With the gelish gel polishes my gel manicure will usually last about two weeks. However, I am always changing my color so I normally don’t go a full two weeks.</li>
    <li> Its a little bit more darker that the color in the picture. Its like a dark turquoise, you will only need two coats because is very pigmented.</li>
    <li> This color is a  perfect teal color.  I got so many compliments from this color. Looks just like the picture</li>
    <li> Love this brand and this color.  Lasts for weeks and looks fresh and shiny for a long time. Would recommend</li>
