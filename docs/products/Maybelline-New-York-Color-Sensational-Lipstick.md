      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>My favorite color too.</li>
      <li>LOVE.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more burgundy in person.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more of a burgundy color?</li>
      <li>Love the color, it applies smoothly too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve included a photo of me wearing the Maybelline New York Color Sensational Creamy Matte Lip Color, Divine Wine.</li>
      <li>For the price, this is a fabulous lipstick.  </li>
      <li>It is very matte and looks nice when applied.</li>

      <li>So far I really do like it, but I find that I do need to reapply more than I would like to.  </li>
      <li>Great long lasting color</li>
      <li>So Creamy, good for dried lips</li>
      <li>Not the most long-lasting lipstick, but never makes my lips feel dry as some of the longwear products can.</li>
      <li>It stays on really well</li>
      <li>The matte color is more modern looking than the red, red candy apple color I used to wear in my 30s.</li>
      <li>This is my new GO TO color!</li>
      <li>I decided this was a worth while purchase (not too expensive &amp; great brand) to see if I could pull off some lipstick with minimal frustration.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not sure I could wear the beige nude or pinks, but the wine color looks pretty much like the photo.</li>
      <li>I have bite, makeup forever, and bare minerals lipsticks</li>

<li> But this is so purple, but then again, it is supposed to look like wine but the pictures look less purple.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not your typical lipstick fanatic because I&#x27;m not fond of looking like a goof if it gets on my teeth.  </li>
<li> not good quality</li>

    <li> It stays on really well</li>
    <li> This is my new GO TO color! Love the color and texture of the lipstick. The matte finish is great and the color looks nice with a gloss applied on top as well. Not the most long-lasting lipstick, but never makes my lips feel dry as some of the longwear products can. Love this product and will purchase it again!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and texture! My mom is tan and this colors looks perfect on her plus being matte it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a fabulous lipstick.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Colour good and great value for price.</li>
    <li> Great long lasting color</li>
    <li> So Creamy, good for dried lips</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, stays on without drying your lips</li>
    <li> The color is simply divine! It&#x27;s smooth and the color looks absolutely amazing with my skin tone. I was expecting to receive a lipstick that was melted during shipment but surprisingly the product was in excellent condition. I can leave it matte or vloss it up. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not your typical lipstick fanatic because I&#x27;m not fond of looking like a goof if it gets on my teeth.  I decided this was a worth while purchase (not too expensive &amp; great brand) to see if I could pull off some lipstick with minimal frustration.  So far I really do like it, but I find that I do need to reapply more than I would like to.  As for it getting on my teeth-- not an issue... I have yet to see any lipstick marks on my teeth so I suppose that&#x27;s a plus. I&#x27;ve included a photo of me wearing the Maybelline New York Color Sensational Creamy Matte Lip Color, Divine Wine.</li>
    <li> I expected a color with a reddish-brown tint. I was expecting more of a burgundy color? But this is so purple, but then again, it is supposed to look like wine but the pictures look less purple. I like it but the color is not what I was expecting. It is very matte and looks nice when applied.</li>
    <li> When i rolled the lipstick up it got stucked and I had to throw it away .... not good quality</li>
    <li> I was waiting for ever in the stores to get Devine wine and it was always sold out. Shipped fast and love the color. Like a burgundy color. My favorite color too. So sexy for a night out on the town. And creamy matte it is. LOVE. I have bite, makeup forever, and bare minerals lipsticks but this lippy is so color potent. It&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s more burgundy in person. Super good. I am tan skinned toned.</li>
    <li> I love the color. Good matte finish but not drying. Color stayed for 4-5 hours</li>
    <li> Quite happy with the intensity of the Divine Wine color. I have dark hair and dark skin so I&#x27;m not sure I could wear the beige nude or pinks, but the wine color looks pretty much like the photo. The product itself glides on creamy. If you give it a sec to dry then it won&#x27;t transfer onto your teeth. It will transfer to cups though, it&#x27;s not like a lip stain. The matte color is more modern looking than the red, red candy apple color I used to wear in my 30s. Product certainly has staying power - I don&#x27;t usually reapply in an 8 hour day unless I ate something.</li>
    <li> Love the color, it applies smoothly too.</li>
    <li> This color is amazing , lasts for hours !&lt;br /&gt;Could never find it in stock at store though , so ordering was the only way to get ahold of this lipstick , shipping was super duper fast! Will purchase againnnnn (;</li>
    <li> Gave it to my friend.  Looks good with her dark skin tone.</li>
