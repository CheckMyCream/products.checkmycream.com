    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem as sharp as others I have used. Will not repurchase</li>
    <li> Great Product! No complaints. Works just as I expected it to! thanks</li>
    <li> These are similar to the Shiseido razors but arrive much quicker. Great to remove dry flaky skin and fine facial hair. Be sure to use an unscented, gentle, mild cream or salve afterwards since these can cause some irritation. A light, consistent touch at the proper angle wink ensure you complete your treatment without causing abrasions, bleeding, or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this done professionally and a surgical blade is used. After my home treatment I used Algernist Overnight Restorative Cream tisooth and moisturize</li>
    <li> Got these within 2 days of ordering. They are exactly as pictured and work well. Will def order again</li>
    <li> I switched from Shiseido Facial Razors to the Gabriella brand because Shishedo was abrasive and left my face irritated and&lt;br /&gt;the skin flaking.  However Gabriella feels even rougher.  I won&#x27;t reorder either brand.  Surely some company&lt;br /&gt;makes a small, sharp, smooth-edge facial razor that glides more smoothly, like the larger razors made for legs, etc.</li>
    <li> not sharp, very cheap.</li>
    <li> These work well, but don&#x27;t throw caution to the wind because you can cut yourself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands and these are without a doubt the very best. They actually cut the hair, what a concept!</li>
    <li> handy little gadget for those pesky facial hairs. no nicks either</li>
    <li> thought it would work better</li>
    <li> i did not like this at all</li>
    <li> I saw these on YouTube.  I really like them...just use at an angle.  Very easy to use....have not succeeded with under my eyebrow....darn it, so keep tweezing there.</li>
    <li> Great for at-home dermabrasion. Just be sure you do your homework and know what you&#x27;re doing (e.g., clean skin, correct angle, areas to use, frequency, etc.). But these little razors will last 3-4 uses in my experience.</li>
    <li> save your money, don&#x27;t buy these. I bought 6 of them but they were not packing like the picture. The quality is very cheap. I tried the first one, the razor is not sharp enough. The second one broke into three pieces. Save your money!!!</li>
    <li> did not come in original package</li>
    <li> Idk what review I read to make me buy this, but I bought two packs thinking hey it&#x27;s popular may work good, but I was wrong. I grow these annoying hairs on my chin and side of my face...this &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; does absolutely nothing! I was hoping it would, but all it did was hurt my skin so bad I broke out. Before you buy this remover this does not imitate a razor in any way and does not successfully get rid of hairs. I&#x27;ve had my mother try it too with no success. Will never purchase this crap again</li>

    <li> A few months ago I bought the Finishing Tough groomer which worked fine; however, it is impossible to find replacement blades.  When I saw Gabriella razor and the very reasonable price I thought it a better option to have disposable razors instead of one razor without refills!!  These are great.  Very easy to use and I might add, &amp;#34;a very close shave.&amp;#34;</li>
