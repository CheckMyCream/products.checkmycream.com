      <li>I love the product I just wish it didn&#x27;t fade</li>
      <li>But way better than using a eyebrow pencil...</li>
      <li>My eyebrows are becoming gray, which makes them patchy looking.  </li>
      <li>This is an easy product to use at home.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Works well, easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>I colored my brows three weeks ago, and the color is staying strong.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m fine.</li>
      <li>Just be careful when you&#x27;re opening the capsule with the dye, to make sure it doesn&#x27;t fly all over your bathroom sink.</li>
      <li>Wears off quite fast if you are using a make up removing face wash!!!</li>
      <li>The soap leaves my face  squeaky clean, and I&#x27;m not switching soap to experiment too</li>
      <li>I have fair skin with brown hair, yet my eyebrows are very blonde in spots.</li>
      <li>Quick and convenent way of tenting eyebrows between hair colors.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple, quick and effective.</li>
      <li>The color is nice after 2 3min applications and about a 10-15min final application.</li>
      <li>Rich and very natural color</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s from experience my first time using this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t do the maximum amount of time for your first application, because you can&#x27;t undo it.</li>
      <li>i had to use vaseline and rubbing alcohol to take it off because i darn sure wasn&#x27;t going out in public looking like that!</li>
      <li>I have naturally medium/dark brown hair and my eyebrows were almost light brown.</li>
      <li>I ordered the dark brown, rather than black shade, and I am very happy with the results!  </li>
      <li>This makes them look much fuller.</li>
      <li>I really like the product</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve reapplied 4 times using one capsule (it doesn&#x27;t take much).</li>
      <li>I have naturally light blonde eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Right now, I&#x27;m experimenting with washing around my eyebrows; so far I&#x27;m on day 4</li>
      <li>I used an entire capsule plus about 6 large drops of the developer and it was way too much, more than enough for 5 people.</li>
      <li>Probably should have ordered the Brown rather than the Dark Brown to more closely match remaining hair color.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, takes less than 10 minutes for the whole process.</li>
      <li>I have reapply a new application every 4 days.  </li>
      <li>Put it on for a short amount of time at first, and then you can always do it again.</li>
      <li>but since this was my first time trying it, i didn&#x27;t want to go too heavy right off the bat.</li>
      <li>Maybe because I wash my face frequently, or because I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much eyebrow I actually had until I used this dye.  </li>
      <li>It does not irritate your skin and makes your eyebrows look natural.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t make a big mess.</li>
      <li>As per directions, you can apply it a second time to achieve the color you seek if the first attempt was not dark enough.</li>
      <li>exactly how long you left it on, and how it came out.</li>
      <li>I use a little almond oil right under and above my eyebrow to avoid skin stain.</li>
      <li>I would prefer a product that would stay on and stain the skin at least for a full 7 days and last throughout washing my face as well.  </li>
      <li>This color is good for every day for me, so ill stick with the dark brown.</li>
      <li>This works very well...just be careful not to loose all the pieces to it.  </li>

<li> I recommend, just be careful where you put the dye!</li>
<li> I followed directions and managed to get dye stains just about everywhere, but other than that</li>
<li> and I use dark brown.</li>
<li> I did have to leave it on the longer time recommended in order to get a dark color</li>
<li> Also, write down on the package (or wherever)</li>
<li> It leaves the skin a little dark so be very careful applying it</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the fading is due to the soap I use on my face</li>
<li> It does stain the skin but washing your face everyday makes the product come off.  </li>
<li> but that comes off within a few days and is no darker than a brow filler would be.</li>
<li> For years, i&#x27;ve been coloring them in, with the occasional (expensive) dye job to treat myself.</li>
<li> for a couple of months my eyebrows slowly started to be bleached by the benzoyl peroxide.</li>
<li> I used to go to an expensive spa every time I wanted my eyebrows tinted.</li>
<li> The spa costs were ridiculous, and making an appointment every time is annoying.</li>
<li> In the worst case scenario, your skin will be a little darker for an hour or two.</li>
<li> the quality is very bad.</li>
<li> it was terrible my eyebrows and eyelids were swollen ended up in the hospital so if your allergic to hair dye this is a no no</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I order this product on a  friday/saturday night it came in that Monday evening, Impressed! I like this product, its easy to apply and the color comes out perfect. The downfall (for I) is I have oily skin, therefore I wash my face two times a day, so the lasting three/six weeks is cut to three days. It takes me 1-2 minutes each to apply, so I&#x27;ve been reapplying before I get in the shower and rinse and they are perfect. The kit comes with four capsule and I&#x27;ve reapplied 4 times using one capsule (it doesn&#x27;t take much). Right now, I&#x27;m experimenting with washing around my eyebrows; so far I&#x27;m on day 4 and I haven&#x27;t seen any fading. I love the product I just wish it didn&#x27;t fade so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the fading is due to the soap I use on my face (Shea Moisture African Black soap). The soap leaves my face  squeaky clean, and I&#x27;m not switching soap to experiment too see if its the cause of the color fading.</li>
    <li> I have naturally light blonde eyebrows. For years, i&#x27;ve been coloring them in, with the occasional (expensive) dye job to treat myself. When I saw this, I was nervous of the color, but I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I followed directions and managed to get dye stains just about everywhere, but other than that (they fade!) I LOVE my eyebrows! no more needing to spend so much money on eyebrow pencils or dye jobs when I can do it myself with such an efficient product. I recommend, just be careful where you put the dye!</li>
    <li> it was terrible my eyebrows and eyelids were swollen ended up in the hospital so if your allergic to hair dye this is a no no</li>
    <li> I use half the capsule to make the product last longer. I use a little almond oil right under and above my eyebrow to avoid skin stain. If it gets on my skin it goes away in a couple washes but without the oil I look like Groucho Marx. As per directions, you can apply it a second time to achieve the color you seek if the first attempt was not dark enough. Easy to use, takes less than 10 minutes for the whole process.</li>
    <li> This product dissapointed me. The color doesn&#x27;t stay in for too long, maybe for 2-3 days...the quality is very bad. I don&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Quick and convenent way of tenting eyebrows between hair colors.  Rich and very natural color and I use dark brown.</li>
    <li> I open the capsules and use half, then close for a second application. The color lasts about 2 weeks on my brows. I have fair skin with brown hair, yet my eyebrows are very blonde in spots. This makes them look much fuller.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is easy to use.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much eyebrow I actually had until I used this dye.  I will definitely use this product over and over again.</li>
    <li> After using Proactiv+ for a couple of months my eyebrows slowly started to be bleached by the benzoyl peroxide. I have naturally medium/dark brown hair and my eyebrows were almost light brown. This worked perfectly! It&#x27;s simple, quick and effective. I left the dye on for less than a minute, the color was equally distributed throughout and it didn&#x27;t stain my skin. The only suggestion I would make to everyone is to only use half the amount of dye they advise you to. I used an entire capsule plus about 6 large drops of the developer and it was way too much, more than enough for 5 people. With that being said, next time I&#x27;ll be saving half of the powder from the capsule and mixing in the developer as needed.</li>
    <li> Wears off quite fast if you are using a make up removing face wash!!! But way better than using a eyebrow pencil...I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are becoming gray, which makes them patchy looking.  I ordered the dark brown, rather than black shade, and I am very happy with the results!  I colored my brows three weeks ago, and the color is staying strong.</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to apply.  Probably should have ordered the Brown rather than the Dark Brown to more closely match remaining hair color.</li>
    <li> I cannot stop recommending this product to fellow blondes. I used to go to an expensive spa every time I wanted my eyebrows tinted. The spa costs were ridiculous, and making an appointment every time is annoying. This product solved all problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t make a big mess. Just be careful when you&#x27;re opening the capsule with the dye, to make sure it doesn&#x27;t fly all over your bathroom sink. That&#x27;s from experience my first time using this.&lt;br /&gt;2. Put it on for a short amount of time at first, and then you can always do it again. Each capsule has plenty of dye to redo it twice. Don&#x27;t do the maximum amount of time for your first application, because you can&#x27;t undo it. Also, write down on the package (or wherever) exactly how long you left it on, and how it came out. This way, the next time you use this you remember what you did the time before.&lt;br /&gt;3. The package recommends using Vaseline around your eyebrows so you don&#x27;t get dye all over your skin. In the worst case scenario, your skin will be a little darker for an hour or two. I wash my face with makeup remover and I&#x27;m fine. Use Vaseline just in case, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only little tiny complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough. Maybe because I wash my face frequently, or because I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot. I need to redo my eyebrows every 3 weeks or so.</li>
    <li> This product works amazing and will save you time and $$ at the salon. I swear by it. Love it!</li>
    <li> This works very well...just be careful not to loose all the pieces to it.  It leaves the skin a little dark so be very careful applying it but that comes off within a few days and is no darker than a brow filler would be.</li>
    <li> loved it....followed directions and it worked perfectly....will definitely purchase it again.  I did have to leave it on the longer time recommended in order to get a dark color</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a caramel color (about an NC44 in Mac foundations) and I applied it twice for the recommended length but it had a yellow greenish haze, i put it on, made dinner then wiped it off and it was great. if id gotten the black, it probably would not have taken so long but since this was my first time trying it, i didn&#x27;t want to go too heavy right off the bat. The color is nice after 2 3min applications and about a 10-15min final application. it tingles from the developer but it&#x27;s not painful or difficult to do. nice product and i will be purchasing again. This color is good for every day for me, so ill stick with the dark brown. Thanks!! (found it through watching YouTube videos.)</li>
    <li> The tint is easy to apply, results great, and  the color lasts.  I use this eyebrow tint when it is needed,  I have used this product for several years.</li>
    <li> This is an easy product to use at home. It does not irritate your skin and makes your eyebrows look natural. Leave it on longer for darker brows. The only issue is it does not keep the gray covered for six weeks; 3-4 weeks max.</li>
    <li> Oh my god, i looked like groucho marx after using this product! if you have sparse eyebrows like i do, do NOT use this product! it looked like i took my nephew&#x27;s paint brush and painted eyebrows on my face. i had to use vaseline and rubbing alcohol to take it off because i darn sure wasn&#x27;t going out in public looking like that!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 5 months and it is great product easy to use and the price is right!</li>
    <li> I really like the product but it doesn&#x27;t last ad long as I would like to.  It does stain the skin but washing your face everyday makes the product come off.  I have reapply a new application every 4 days.  I would prefer a product that would stay on and stain the skin at least for a full 7 days and last throughout washing my face as well.  The product mixes very easily and begins to color immediately.  Takes a total of 5-7 minutes.</li>
