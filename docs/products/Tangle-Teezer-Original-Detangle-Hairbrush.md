      <li>it make you comfortable</li>
      <li>in loooooove with this fabulous brush ðŸ’“</li>
      <li>I have a lot of split ends because my hair breaks easily, so I thought this would be a more gentle alternative to my paddle brush.</li>
      <li>with a good detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will never go back to a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush!</li>

      <li>/&gt;Start from the top and work down using light strokes.</li>
      <li>One of my granddaughters recommended this for our 6 year old granddaughter&#x27;s super curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I have had much better results with the Wet Brush.</li>
      <li>The bristles flex, so they don&#x27;t get caught in snarls and pull the hair - they just glide over them, gently un-snarling them one brushstroke at a time.  </li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>It has really helped save the health of my hair.</li>
      <li>I also use it on my child&#x27;s hair , simple and pain free detangling</li>
      <li>Smooths my wiry, frizzy hair, gentle and inexpensive.</li>
      <li>My daughter has very curly hair and this makes brushing time way quicker in the morning.</li>
      <li>It gets the job done fast, and well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cost much anyway.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using it since it makes my hair easier to brush even though it seems to cause just as much breakage as a paddle brush.</li>
      <li>She calls it her &amp;#34;kidney brush&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s made getting ready each morning much easier.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t understand the hype about this brush?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Amazing hair brush,I will recommended for all my friends!</li>
    <li> If you have ever had a little girl in full tears during hair brushing... this is a must buy.  It works great on my 6 year olds medium curly, medium thick hair.  On my other girls thick straight hair, it helps but doesn&#x27;t always get all the way through</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull at all, even when hair is wet.</li>
    <li> This brush is a god send! My daughter has very curly hair and this makes brushing time way quicker in the morning. Also if her hair is wet, it takes seconds. I love it!</li>
    <li> in loooooove with this fabulous brush ðŸ’“</li>
    <li> I like the feeling hair brush touching my scalp.</li>
    <li> Love this thing , not only do I use it on my hair I also use it on my child&#x27;s hair , simple and pain free detangling</li>
    <li> Is really good for hair</li>
    <li> Skeptical at first for daughter&#x27;s hair, but this thing works really well, even with dry hair.  She calls it her &amp;#34;kidney brush&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s made getting ready each morning much easier.</li>
    <li> Brush works well but brush tips bend and break off easily.</li>
    <li> You will love love love this unique brush!</li>
    <li> my mom loves it. i gave this comb to her as a gift. she said it worked very great</li>
    <li> This is my third one! I like it!</li>
    <li> it make you comfortable</li>
    <li> very good, my child love it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this to be a good de-tangler at all. The shape is awkward to hold and it hurt my head. The noise it makes while brushing your hair is scary to say the least. I prefer the wet brush.</li>
    <li> Very good for my curly daughter hair</li>
    <li> Love it and will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Good product for my daughter. She loves it. :)</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller !!!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to use, can comb hair easily, nice look, i like it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good, and I like this colour.æƒ æƒ è´­ç‰©åŠ©æ‰‹å°±æ˜¯å¥½ç”¨ :-D</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a revolution in long hair brushing! Love</li>
    <li> My three year old hates having her fine hair brushed and we were desperate! So far this has been wonderful! We&#x27;ve only used it while her hair was wet but no screaming at all. I was on the fence about this but I&#x27;m glad we got it.</li>
    <li> works great for tangles for curly hair</li>
    <li> This really helps untangle and soften if you have thin hair or are trying to grow it out. It has really helped save the health of my hair. And it doesn&#x27;t hurt! Love my Tangle Teezer.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter, who is a few weeks shy of 2. This is the only brush she will let me use on her, because it doesn&#x27;t pull her head all around. It gets the job done fast, and well. She also likes that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;PINK!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> One of my granddaughters recommended this for our 6 year old granddaughter&#x27;s super curly hair.  We all Love it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best item I have ordered in years!!!  It goes through tangles in one pass without pulling.  Simply amazing!!!</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> If I called this brush &#x27;llife altering&#x27; it would not be an exaggeration!  Okay.  Well, maybe.  :)  BUT - is is AMAZING!  I have a pack of girls, each needing time in the morning to turn their epic bedhead disasters (what DO they do all night?!) into something socially acceptable.  I used to have to do each one, detangler in one hand, assorted brushes and combs in the other - HOURS, I tell you, HOURS per week, including tears, accusations of torture, temper tantrums, and that&#x27;s just ME.  The kids were even WORSE!  :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the tangle teezer.  I bought one on a whim at a local drugstore.  Oh. My.  We all stood in awestruck silence.  Peace reigned morning after morning.  This brush has soft, flexible &#x27;bristles&#x27; of different heights that gently push through each layer of tangle, going deeper each time as the tangles are smoothed into submission.  The bristles flex, so they don&#x27;t get caught in snarls and pull the hair - they just glide over them, gently un-snarling them one brushstroke at a time.  The BEST BEST BEST part is that the kids can do this THEMSELVES!!!  Oh happy day!  I just got back at least 7 hours each week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only fly in the ointment was that I do have that &#x27;pack of girls&#x27; so one brush wasn&#x27;t going to do it for us.  At the store, I&#x27;d paid about $15 for one, so buying a bunch was going to get pricey.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  For $8 apiece, I could afford to get one for each kid, plus two &#x27;house&#x27; spares to keep in our go-bag, and linen closet.  Seriously, it&#x27;s made a huge difference in our morning routine - every morning - and that&#x27;s absolutely worth it!</li>
    <li> I have 4 girls all diff hair type curly thin thick and  long and this brush saves tears and time we now own 5 one for each girl and one for myself :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful gift for myself and girl friend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so comfortable! I bought it for the second time!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very amazing. I just drop little hair when I use it to comb my hair.</li>
    <li> It is very good and i wanna buy two more for my mom and nanny</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay, not really special.</li>
    <li> Febulous!!!!It&#x27;s fresh, varied, fun!!! Like it very much!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I can use on my hair, wet or dry, to de tangle. I have long, thick hair, and it&#x27;s a beast! This little thing has made life a lot less painful. Hallelujah. It really works.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush in the hopes that it would be better for my hair. I have a lot of split ends because my hair breaks easily, so I thought this would be a more gentle alternative to my paddle brush. I love how easily I can brush my hair now, especially right out of the shower. It&#x27;s definitely a good buy if youre looking for something that won&#x27;t hurt your head when you brush. However, I&#x27;m a little dissapointed with how much hair it pulls out. It still hasn&#x27;t helped the breakage problem. I&#x27;m still using it since it makes my hair easier to brush even though it seems to cause just as much breakage as a paddle brush.</li>
    <li> Very good, I like also to buy next time.</li>
    <li> Very welll, good as it&#x27;s described.</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING.  My daughter has a crazy bed head every morning due to her thin hair. I used to spend forever trying to deranged it.  The spray products didn&#x27;t help.  It takes seconds to get the tangled mess out with this brush.  It was a great invention.</li>
    <li> My granddaughters have fine hair that gets snarls in it.  Using this brush has taken the tears away.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my three year old because of hair brushing issues. She has very long hair that gets tangled very easily. Hair brushing was the most stressful part of our morning routine. If anyone has had a child with sensitive hair, you know what I mean. Crying, screaming, running (sometimes on my part). It got so bad that I considered shaving her head. I finally went to Amazon to try and find something that I could brush her hair with as a last resort. Let me tell you this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is a LIFE saver. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought three now. We call it the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; brush. Both my daughters and myself will only use this brush. If I can&#x27;t find it, I will not use another brush. I will stop everything I am doing to go find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it perfect? No. It does still pull hair on occasion, especially when you get down to the last few tangled strands. But my daughter will actually sit still when I brush her hair. I would pay any amount for this brush for the benefit it has on my sanity alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Useful things to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start from the top and work down using light strokes. It might take a little longer but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to drop, it fits in the palm of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use with a good detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will never go back to a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush!</li>
    <li> Smooths my wiry, frizzy hair, gentle and inexpensive. I bought three!</li>
    <li> price is better than British, but not for persn who has thick and long hair. I still use my old  Horn Comb before use it.</li>
    <li> This is a life changer if you have kids with tangles. We now own 4 of these and I wont even travel without one! Works incredibly well. Makes getting tangles out painless.</li>
    <li> This is amazing&lt;br /&gt;I will buy 2more</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see the hype in this hairbrush honestly. I have VERY thick hair and this hairbrush really doesn&#x27;t brush to the bottom of my hair and the middle parts of it. As other reviewers said, this caused some knots in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin hair, unlike me, this may be the brush for you but thick hair people I would recommend to stay away from this.</li>
    <li> Very nice comb. Same day delivery is awesome!</li>
    <li> used it like 1.5 times. excited to use it more. I pray for tangle free hair!! :)</li>
    <li> I like this very much</li>
    <li> If you can, def get the second gen as it&#x27;s wayyyy better. I&#x27;ve used mine for a few weeks and I can see it slowly going bad :/</li>
    <li> excellent product, fulfils it&#x27;s promises</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend it!</li>
    <li> All of my friends who use it said they super love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to my Mom.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it because of the easy-using and color.&lt;br /&gt;Very convenient.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this item! My daughter&#x27;s fine hair rats terribly at night. This combs right through with out the screaming fuss. This brush may have saved my sanity!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the hype about this brush? For my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is wavy, not curly, it worked the same as any other brush.</li>
    <li> this is a great brush for fine hair.  For thick hair you have to cut amount in half.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and it does take some time to get through it but t does pretty well with the tangles. It would be great for a little girl. It also fits in the palm of your hand which allows them to do it themselves</li>
    <li> bought it as a gift for my sister because she likes mine a lot. big fan of this product, I bought the big one and leave it in the house too! makes my life easier. I have really damaged hair and I hate to brush my hair because it&#x27;s just too painful to do so. but who doesn&#x27;t like silky hair?! but I do have to say that, this product is not make for people have really really thick hair, I mean if you dont mind brush it couple times, why not! get one!</li>
    <li> It works...but not better than any other brush. It was a cute stocking stuffer but not sure how much its worth...</li>
    <li> One word: UNBELIEVABLE. We struggled every morning untangling our daughter&#x27;s long hair. Every time, she ended up crying and letting go of a loud scream to show us how mad she was for hurting her. This brush is truly amazing. I still can&#x27;t believe how it manages to go through her hair at such ease untangling even the toughest tangles. The best purchase I did in years... and at such a low price. This is the product I recommend all my friends with daughters with long hair. And yes, no more primal wails in the morning.</li>
    <li> Hard to grip in smaller hands (mine and hers)  and there is not a handle option.  Not sure what is so special about it.  It doesn&#x27;t seem any different than other brushes.  My daughter said it hurt and I didn&#x27;t notice it getting any tangles out any better/ easier.  Her hair is medium length and kind of fine, but tangles very easily.  Super disappointed because I really need something to help with my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this brush but was disappointed. I have very thick hair that tangles easily and thought this would be a great solution based on the previous reviews but it felt like it just skimmed over the top of my hair. I have had much better results with the Wet Brush. This product might be excellent for children but I was not impressed.</li>
    <li> like it a lot. but a little bit hard to grab it. and the brush a little bit to small. but still like it.</li>
    <li> After seeing so many good reviews, I can not help giving it a shot.  It did not work so magically for me.  It doesn&#x27;t cost much anyway.</li>
    <li> I use this several times a day. It&#x27;s used in the shower after I&#x27;ve used conditioner and after I&#x27;ve gotten out of the shower. I also use it throughout the day, I like how it feels on my scalp. It truly helps in getting knots out of your hair, I have very fine hair.</li>
    <li> Best thing I ever bought for my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice and good</li>
    <li> Bought this after a recommendation from a friend. My daughter and I both have fine and tangled hair. This does seem to help. Not sure it was worth $8 though.</li>
    <li> As every desperate mother here I bought into the idea that this regular ole bristle brush would miraculously detangle my daughters crazy curly hair! Let me tell you, it was no miracle brush! She screamed just the same! We dont even use this waste of money anymore because if she is going to scream and cry im going to at least use my brush with a handle! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! It is not worth it!</li>
