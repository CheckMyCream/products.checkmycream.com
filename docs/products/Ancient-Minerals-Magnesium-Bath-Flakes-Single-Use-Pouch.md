      <li>I know, Ancient Minerals would rather sell you the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; and they may even have a point that theirs is better processed, but making my own still works great for me and my family and the benefits</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great seller*** great product</li>
    <li> Great way to get your magnesium.&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking magnesium for over a year orally and it did&#x27;nt seem to help much.&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be a much more effective way to get the magnesium I need at a great&lt;br /&gt;price 40 dollars.</li>
    <li> Arrived so quickly and is great for the deodorant I made. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Excellent I am totaly happy this product is the best I have ever purchased, top quality.</li>
    <li> I love taking a long hot salt bath this is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as discribed</li>
    <li> A good tub soak once a week, with these minerals, helps relieve my foot and leg cramps.</li>
    <li> The bag is quite large and very expensive and was dismayed when the directions instructed a full bag be used for a single bath.  I have been using less than two cups per bath and have experienced some calming effect.  Too expensive for the purpose.</li>
    <li> they helped my daughter alot</li>
    <li> This along with Bob&#x27;s baking soda in a full bath got rid of my eczema!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I have metabolic syndrome, which makes it hard for me to lose weight. When I started using this product regularly I noticed not only feeling better but I had a little weight loss! This product is also so wonderful and just relaxing your muscles and making you feel good overall. I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 6 months and fully intend to keep using!!</li>
    <li> 8 lbs is a lot of magnesium flakes, wow. Shipped in good condition.  I made magnesium oil homemade with it and it turned out great from what I can tell.  I have sensitive skin and I find magnesium oil makes certain parts of my skin smart and lightly burn, whereas my husband slathers it on without a single problem.  I find it best to apply, wait the 20-30 mins for absorption, then wipe surface of skin with wet cloth. Works fine that way, and actually my legs feel so relaxed following a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon, for offering this large bag with Amazon prime and at a good price! ($39.95)</li>
    <li> Ancient Minerals Magnesium bath Flakes is used for a bath soak to relieve sore, stiff muscles after a day of yard work</li>
    <li> Minerals were everything I expected.  Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! I made a detox bath with hot water and stayed in tub approx 20 minutes.  Drink plenty of water!  You will feel great. Sore muscles went away, sleep like a baby!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> best way to infuse magnesium</li>
    <li> Beautiful magnesium flakes, just as they were advertised.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I did two bath soaks with Magnesium Chloride by Ancient Minerals. Wow, I never felt better. I do not take baths in general. I mixed 3 cups with 1/2 cup baking soda (can do 1 cup, but I have sensitive skin), and 1/4 cup bentonite clay. You can do foot soaks instead, which is much more economical. Most Americans are deficient in Mg, and transdermal absorption is the best way to rapidly bring up your Mg levels, plus you won&#x27;t get diarrhea, which you get if you ingest too much Mg too fast. You can also do the oil, apply 20-30 min before a shower as you will eventually itch like crazy.</li>
    <li> The package arrived fast. I use the minerals in a footbath before I go to bed. The minerals relax me to a profound degree. I have never slept better.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has difficulty in sleeping.</li>
    <li> Great product. I would order this again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> nice big bag and we use for foot bath and mix with distilled water for transdermal spray. I do see where the AM people advise using their oil and claiming that the heating process to make flakes puts some undesirable elements in the flakes for making oil but too many others make the oil from the flakes and the cost is much less. I know they say it costs them a lot to properly filter the oil but can&#x27;t see why it would be unsafe to spray on but okay to soak in???  haven&#x27;t read anywhere that someone has been adversely affected by making the transdermal oil spray, if anyone knows please post facts.</li>
    <li> Only complaint is that I ran out. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> LOVE these in my bath.  Have been the most helpful thing to me of anything I&#x27;ve tried for my back pain.</li>
    <li> I was having angina from coronary arterial spasm (rather than blocked arteries).  It was brought on by stress, not exertion.  I had used epsom salts in baths and they were relaxing, but didn&#x27;t do anything for the chest pain.  When I read about this I purchased the Ancient Minerals&#x27; special of 1.65 lb bags for about $7.50 each.  I put in 1 lb of the flakes to a hot tub of water and soaked for 45 minutes.  It completely took away the chest pain.  Now I use the flakes to make the magnesium oil (mg dissolved in water), and use it topically after a shower.  Or if I have angina--It may take 15 minutes to work, but it works.  I reported this to my doctor, because it worked better than a prescribed calcium channel blocker, and she gave it her approval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t say this will work for standard angina that is caused by arteries being blocked by plaques, and I&#x27;m not advocating that anyone with heart disease go outside a doctor&#x27;s advice, or use this instead of prescribed medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just giving an account of my own experience.  And, I&#x27;m convinced this is well absorbed through the skin and relaxes muscle and blood vessels.  Maybe I&#x27;m just deficient in magnesium or I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem to start with.  I don&#x27;t like to take pills with stearates, so this works best for me.</li>
    <li> I look into and try many magnesium products..  This is magnesium chloride flakes not the magnesium sulfate that make up Epsom salts.  I am not the expert to say what one is better for you, I use both and others taken orally.  This product is on the expensive side, the bag suggests using up to the entire 8 pound bag for one bath.  Other magnesium chloride product are less expensive. Frankly I cant afford to use this often. I wish they clearly stated what else is in the flakes. The bag says its 47% magnesium chloride with no mention of what filler products are used or why they need 53% of filler products..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I will go with my favorite product, certified dead sea salts supplied by &amp;#34;salt works&amp;#34; (often mixed with a quality Epsom salt).  As for recommendations I would refer to Dr Carolyn Dean&#x27;s book, &amp;#34;the miracle of magnesium&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> One of three ingredients for a long bath soak... particularly good after a long, electrolyte depleting workout. It&#x27;s one of my staples.</li>
    <li> In order to get the best results, you need to use at least 5-8 lbs in your bath.  This means the dosage for a bath would take the whole bag of flakes.  At $42.00 per bag, that makes a bath pretty expensive.  We prefer this brand and they make an oil that we cannot live without.  But we will probably only use this on a very rare occasion.  The product is worth 5 stars if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this to make Magnesium Cream - helps put me to sleep at night :)  I&#x27;ve tried to do a spritz for after showers for my husband - he sometimes remembers to use it! I&#x27;ve read a lot about being low on Magnesium..so every little bit helps!</li>
    <li> I make magnesium oil with it and put it in blue bottles and have a small spray one and give it as gifts.</li>
    <li> I use this as a foot soak - after working in heels all day, it feels great to soak my feet.  I have used Epsom salt, but I have to say that I prefer the magnesium flakes.</li>
    <li> This is great quality magnesium. It makes very nice magnesium oil and is great for bath soaks. Transdermal magnesium helps insomnia, muscle aches, and constipation!</li>
    <li> Very good for the price and seem pretty clean, great for a nice bath.</li>
    <li> This  is  very helpful for  painful conditions that are generally treated with ordinary epsom salts. It goes beyond in theraputic value  to  relieve pain, and provide magnesium  through the skin.</li>
    <li> I made my own magnesium spray which I need to spray on my body a lot each day - but too often I forget.  I would add to a good bath but I shower because it is hard for me to get out of the tub - Can you imagine - with my having a hard time to get out plus the fact of how relaxed I would be after this bath - how much harder it would be to get out....  lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No reason to worry about getting too much magnesium as our bodies secret anything it doesn&#x27;t need.  The problem with us today is that we don&#x27;t get enough by eating the foods that no longer grown with lots of magnesium - much too depleted today.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Made magnesium oil. Spray it on everyday</li>
    <li> If you purchase this SAME item from the manufacturer you will get hit with a unnecessarily high shipping charge (more than your product cost). These salts are amazing and have helped me with my body aches. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> These came recommended to me by my doctor so I really believed they&#x27;d work. I am so upset I wasted $40 on these because I didn&#x27;t see any relief at all. Cheap regular Epsom salts have the same effect.</li>
    <li> This product is essentially Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate [MgCl2(H2O)6] - the most common hydrated crystalline form of Magnesium Chloride. That makes it approximately 12% by weight magnesium. It is the magnesium in an easily absorbable form that provides the bennefit from this product. Magnesium Chloride is remarkable soluble in water. At high concentrations it feels almost oily or slippery which is why it is called &amp;#34;Oil of Magnesium&amp;#34; in this form though, there is nothing but water and magnesium chloride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag contains eight pounds of snow white flakes about the size of &amp;#34;Kellogs Corn flakes&amp;#34;. I cannot speak as to the purity of the product, but my impression is that since it is apparently processed by re-crystallization (sort of like table salt is processed) it is probably fairly pure. This product is not labeled for consumption or oral usage as far as I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make a strong solution of Magnesium Chloride by weighing out 700 grams (1 1/2 pounds) of the flakes in a 1 liter (1 quart US) container. This amount fills the the container by volume when dry. Then I pour in distilled water to fill the container to the 1 liter (1 US quart, 32 US fluid ounces) capacity with the water and calcium chloride flakes. Then stir and let it sit to fully disolve. This concentration happens to equal to 420 mg of magnesium (US RDA for senior men) per 5 ml (one US teaspoon). However, remember that this product is NOT labeled or certified for oral use - this is just a reference as to the strength of this particular solution. Let the solution sit about an hour to be fully dissolved. Then I strain the solution through a clean, fresh coffee filter to remove whatever hasn&#x27;t dissolved. Then I heat the strained solution in a Pyrex container in the microwave until it just begins to boil. The purpose is to kill any microorganisms that might be present. I then rinse my glass or plastic bottles (and funnel) to be used for storage (after they have been thoroughly washed) in ordinary 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Drain, but do not dry the inside (the peroxide kills microorganisms that might be present in the container). Once the solution has cooled enough to safely pour into the storage bottles you are done. You now have your own mix of &amp;#34;oil of magnesium&amp;#34; considerably cheaper than buying it pre-mixed. If you don&#x27;t feel like doing all the steps to be sure you don&#x27;t have any microorganisms or contaminants in your mix, then buy the already made solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary reason to use the concentrated Magnesium Chloride solution on your skin as opposed to in a bath is for economy. Assuming it takes two to four times the oral RDA equivalent applied to your skin (2 to 4 teaspoons) per day, the cost is around 8 to 16 cents per day at Amazon&#x27;s current price for the 8 pound bag. If you use the magnesium chloride flakes in your bath you will need to use at least 1/4 pounds at a cost of $1.35 per day.

Drain, but do not dry the inside (the peroxide kills microorganisms that might be present in the container). Once the solution has cooled enough to safely pour into the storage bottles you are done. You now have your own mix of &amp;#34;oil of magnesium&amp;#34; considerably cheaper than buying it pre-mixed. If you don&#x27;t feel like doing all the steps to be sure you don&#x27;t have any microorganisms or contaminants in your mix, then buy the already made solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary reason to use the concentrated Magnesium Chloride solution on your skin as opposed to in a bath is for economy.

    <li> I am not as impressed as I was hoping.  I did not find it any better than Epsom salt and for 35 plus 15 shipping it was not worth it.</li>
    <li> Magnesium Bath Flakes are such an easy way to get much needed magnesium supplements. They dissolve quickly and my muscles love the relaxing bath or foot soak. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I read about Magnesium bath flakes and decided that it was a product that would help me as well as my family. I made the oil, put into spray bottles and have seen results. It is a short term relief. But it is helping me with pain. I know it is a great way to get more magnesium into my system. I shared some with my neighbor and she also has experienced positive results.  MP</li>
    <li> Use this after a strenuous workout if I&#x27;m in a lot of pain. It helps relieve the tension and I  sleep better. Helps with anxiety to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this magnesium to make Magnesium oil (1/2 cup flakes to 1/2 cup hot distilled water, mix thoroughly, allow to cool, &amp; put in spray bottle. use 10-15 sprays daily) &amp; Magnesium body butter. This is by far the best brand of magnesium flakes I&#x27;ve tried so far. It&#x27;s very potent &amp; I feel it working right away relaxing the tension right out of my muscles.</li>
    <li> best soak ever! I feel great! I think you should try this at least once to know weather or not it could help you.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I put on 2 different kitchen scales and it was just barely over 7.5 lbs with the bag... :(</li>
    <li> I followed another reviewer&#x27;s directions for making my own Oil of Magnesium.  I dissolved 1/2 c. Of the flakes in a 1/2 c. Of water, then put it into a small spray bottle.  I use it to sooth tense, painful muscles.  This is definitely more cost effective than buying the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;.  And I don&#x27;t have to use near as much of my magnesium supplement;this is pretty potent stuff!</li>
    <li> Works well, goes too fast.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. This product seems to be quite in the short term, that is, for the period of time I have used it which is about a month</li>
    <li> I received timely. Packaged well. Great quality! Suits my purpose of making my own magnesium oil and lotions. Will be reordering this product when I run out.</li>
    <li> When it comes to simple relaxation, soothing aching muscles and menstrual cramps, this stuff is the best. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it always delivers great results. And the 8 pound bag is a far better deal than the 5 pound container.</li>
    <li> When my back injury is causing unbearable pain, and/or my muscles are very painful from my back down my leg, and up to my neck, I soak 20 minutes in a warm bath with magnesium flakes and the pain stops completely.  When I get out of the tub, I have no pain at all.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  If I could afford it, I would use it at least twice a week, as I have a back injury that never heals and causes me great pain. I have been to chiropractors who did not help at all, to pain clinics and received steroid injections in my back that would kill the nerve pain for only a few months, to orthopedic surgeons who drugged me with muscle relaxers and pain pills, but no relief, but the magnesium bath soaks is the only remedy for relieving and healing muscle pain instantly and long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reports that say magnesium is 100% absorbable through the skin only, and it is really a waste to take magnesium pills because they mostly pass through as waste.  Very valuable information. That&#x27;s why I ordered the magnesium flakes for soaking baths, and the magnesium oil for massage.  And it&#x27;s important to buy the best brand, Ancient Minerals, per Dr. reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a scale of 1-5, I rate it a 20.  Nothing better for you and more effective.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Makes a soothing foot soak &amp; oil spray.  Helps alleviate plantar fascitis.  I will continue to recommend these magnesium flakes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Good for sore muscles, hemorrhoids, rashes, etc. Better that the run-of-the-mill epsom salts.</li>
    <li> Everyone says this is the most trustworthy brand, and the prices on Amazon are way better than at my local health shop, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Eight pounds is a lot of product. I got a lot of uses out of it.</li>
    <li> My child suffers from leg cramps and growing pains.  He was waking up a couple of nights a week with them.  The doctor couldn&#x27;t find any medical issues so we started to look at nutritional deficits.  I didn&#x27;t want to add more Magnesium from standard supplements, so I tried this in his bath instead.  I was skeptical, but it actually does seem to help.  I put about a 1/4 cup in his bathtub at night before bed and he just soaks and plays a usual.  I have noticed that when I forget to put it in or I have run out, he is more likely to have a leg cramp that night.  We have gone from two to three a week to maybe one or two a month now.</li>
    <li> I am low in magnesium and along with medication love to use Ancient Minerals Magnesium as bath flakes and for foot soaks.  It is very relaxing and helps me to fall asleep faster.  It is also a better quality product than the crystals found in most stores.</li>
    <li> Fantastic addition to the bath.  Wish the price were a bit less.</li>
    <li> We use it and like it.  Good way to get magnesium into body soaking in bath tub.</li>
    <li> I used magnesium baths for a few months and found out that after testing my magnesium levels did not change at all.  I made sure the water was at the appropriate temperature.  I put in much more than 1.65lb in the tub.  Strangely, some of my muscle tightness went away and I had some decent nights sleep.  I thought this was due to the magnesium.  So I thought I was doing its job of getting magnesium into my body.  Well I was shocked to find that it did absolutely nothing to my Mag RBC test results.  I was taking mag orally so I actually think it caused my magnesium levels to go down!!  Please get tested before and after using this product to ensure it is doing what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I love this big bag. I made my own magnesium lotion this time which is very nice.</li>
    <li> I loved using this product brand as an alternative to buying magnesium oil in the bottle. This has saved me allot of money.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with making your own magnesium oil with these flakes.  I have used the flakes in my bath as well as my oil and my muscles are thanking me.</li>
    <li> I like the salts and I&#x27;ve found that by placing one flake on a sore with a little warm water, it&#x27;s better. It&#x27;s just so pricey for the bag.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product for many reasons. I started using it over a year ago and have all three of my daughters using it also. Really helps balance our hormones for starters. Just really relaxes the mind and body also. My husband uses it for a bad back. Works well.</li>
    <li> I read about the important of Magnesium and searching I find out about Ancient Minerals brand. I am really happy, also I recommend the Magnesium oil.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really compare the bath flakes to anything else, as I have never used bath flakes before.  The reason for the purchase, was to make a magnesium oil to spray topically and it&#x27;s the best thing ever! I am soooo very relax, no stress and no pain in my fingers. After I shower, I spray my legs, arms and tummy (approx. 20 sprays) and for me it works instantly, I will never do without!</li>
    <li> Perfect! used it for foot soaks and also to make magnesium oil.  I am very happy with it in every way.</li>
    <li> I have purchased other magnesium products from another source, but have found this magnesium to be the best quality. I have suffered with chronic pain for over 10 yrs from a car accident and my spine was twisted which causes muscles to be over taught in my back from my neck to my low back. This gives my muscles almost instant relief. Instead of running for the advil, I rub on magnesium oil. Major relief without the side effects! Won&#x27;t be without!!</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping, happy with purchase. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> worked as advertised by Dr. Mark Sircus.</li>
    <li> This is far more effective than Epsom salts. I&#x27;m a fitness instructor, and I have Fibromyalgia. So I rely on this to keep my body functioning!</li>
    <li> The product is amazing for a foot bath and for making Magnesium Oil - 1 part Magnesium to one part boiling water, stirred and put on a glass bottle gives you a good Mg-oil with which to spray your skin. My husband&#x27;s psoriasis on his scalp is gone now, my split thumb nail is healed after 10 years, my skin is getting smoother, softer and less wrinkled, my feet are less calloused (pedicure much easier for the spa). I recommend the product and did read a book - Trans-dermal Magnesium Therapy - before I STARTED USING IT.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Love these. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great for everything!!  From aches and pains to sleeping better.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Will buy it again...</li>
    <li> I bought  this product to get more magnesium into my system, hoping it will help alleviate some muscle twitching.  I think it might be working!  I isoak in it and also make a &#x27;lotion&#x27; out of it by boiling two cups of water, then dissolving a half cup of flakes in it, put into a spray bottle and use on sore/ injured muscles (10-30 sprays per day). It leaves a salty residue and can be a little itchy like sea water is after swimming in the ocean but this can be wiped off after a bit.</li>
    <li> It was worth buying the 8 lbs bag for $39!</li>
    <li> I use this product to make a magnesium oil that I spray on myself.  In my experience, it helps with healthy elimination and restful sleep.  I have no complaints about this product!</li>
    <li> I use this to make magnesium oil, its wonderful.  Most people are deficient in magnesium and using the mag oil is a great way to get more magnesium.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product. I&#x27;ve dealt with severe core cramping for months and after several attempts to resolve, it became evident I has a serious magnesium deficiency. After 3 baths, cramping disappeared completely. I use this on a regular basis and my wife who has foot pain has experienced almost immediate results from doing foot soaks. I do think it is overpriced, though the benefits outweigh the cost.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was recommended from one of my favorite bloggers to fight (cough . . . ) constipation. See this article on how to make your own magnesium oil using this product: [...]  In case you need this for the same reason, I also take the Vitacost brand magnesium supplement that she refers to (Magnesium Calm) and do everything on her list except the water enema; just can&#x27;t bring myself to do it and everything is pretty much normal anyways now. :)</li>
    <li> makes for a great bath !! really nice flakes and creates relaxation ......</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how easily this dissolved.I made magnesium oil by using equal amounts of distilled water and magnesium flakes, put into a squirt bottle and it works great. I just spray it on my arms and torso and then I get this surge of energy like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. Maybe its just me because my daughter said it makes her tired. I sprayed some on my grandaughter&#x27;s arms and she said it stung and burned. She had to wash it off and a rash appeared all over her arms where it had been. She has always had very dry skin so maybe that had something to do with it. My husband sprays it on his arms and torso, said it seemed to give him energy, but one day sprayed it on then put on a ribbed thermal shirt to go to work and had to take the shirt off when he got to work because of the burning and stinging. He said everywhere the ribs of the thermal came into contact with his skin burned like crazy. I have had slight stinging when spraying it on after scrubbing in the shower, but just for a few seconds. However, I believe I feel better and more energetic since starting  using it.</li>
    <li> These are far superior to your basic Epson salts.  My wife swears by them to help her sleep a night.  She says when she takes a hot bath before bed she feels like jello when she gets out of the tub.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my 3 year old son who has eczema.  It works amazing.  After about a week of baths with at least 2 or 3 cups of the flakes his eczema is gone.  Nothing else works. I follow up with Mustela Lipid replenishing balm. After his skin heals I use less flakes in the water. I know it&#x27;s not cheap but I&#x27;ll pay anything to make him feel better.  I did notice that it does seem to have a calming effect on my son too. I told my son&#x27;s GI doctor that I&#x27;ve been using it and she immediately Googled it. She said that it makes sense because the salt will kill any bacteria in the wounds and heal it. She also said that the magnesium is great especially if a child who doesn&#x27;t get it from vegetables. She also said it can have a positive neurological effects.  Great stuff</li>
    <li> This is great for making magnesium oil, which helps with aches and pains.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting that the recommended amount to use in a single bath was half a bag to the entire contents of the bag, depending on what concentration you want. As expensive as this stuff is that is too much. I will say it seemed to have helped my 87 year old dad with his muscle cramping, but then he also uses the magnesium oil spray made by this same company and gets the same results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my bath flakes in foot soaks and in my bath tub. I even learned how to make magnesium oil and used this high quality bath flakes from Ancient Minerals, I carry my magnesium chloride with wherever I go. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results of the transdermal magnesium therapy.</li>
    <li> I use these salts in the bath for aching muscles - add a few drops of lavender oil as well.  Relaxing like Epsom salts, but the effect of the bath stays with you longer than Epsom salts.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> really works, if you are consistent for couple of months pains disappear</li>
    <li> Everyone needs this in their regular routine!!!  It REALLY helps with aches and pains and replenishes our magnesium levels that are soooooo important ----  but soooo  depleted!!!</li>
    <li> Works great!!  I make the magnesium oil (half bath flakes and half distilled water).  It is helping me with my blood pressure, with sensitivity to cold, I feel more relaxed and also a skin rash I have had for 4 years is gone.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without my baths. They have helped me so much. I use a cup to two cups at a time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using magnesium flakes, lotion, and oil for a few years now. When money was tight I bought another brand thinking it would save me money. Big mistake. I ended up using twice the amount and still didn&#x27;t feel the same results I get with Ancient Minerals. If you need to be convinced about magnesium and its benefits and necessity in the human body, do your research. When you&#x27;re done get this brand! Unless something changes I&#x27;ll most likely be a customer for life. My body does not function optimally without monthly soaks in this.</li>
    <li> This is a great price ($40 for 8 lb) for this Mag salt to make the mag oil(brine) at home for a fraction of the price they charge for it themselves. 1 cup salt in 1 cup water is the recipe for the brine. They charge $86 last I checked for a 64 oz bottle of the Mag oil. You can make it for less than $10 here with their mag salt.&lt;br /&gt; Magnesium deficiency is real and causes so many diffuse health problems that many people go their whole lives without realizing that is the root cause of many of their problems and why they are taking what amounts to a small pharmacy daily.&lt;br /&gt;It causes arrhythmia, joint pain, muscle pain, eye twitches, insomnia... Right there is about ten different medication prescriptions that could be solved with a combination of magnesium baths, magnesium muscle massage and a good magnesium glycinate supplement like Premier research labs magnesium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This salt is a good value even if you just buy it for baths, but for more bang for your buck, make the magnesium oil.</li>
    <li> Good product, but expensive.  But not any more expensive than other products of this type.  Dissolves very quickly.  I would reorder.  It&#x27;s an excellent way to replenish magnesium in your body.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Clear when disolved in water. No grey residue.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Arrived on time and very helpful for improved health</li>
    <li> The best deal around for the only real solution I have ever found for my magnesium deficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I know, Ancient Minerals would rather sell you the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; and they may even have a point that theirs is better processed, but making my own still works great for me and my family and the benefits are huge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste these flakes by dumping them en masse into your bath, either. If you are rich enough to do that, give some to me instead because I am not (lol). But even if you have the money to burn on this, why waste these flakes when there are better ways to get the benefits from them? Please, do keep reading:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While soaking, just put about a teaspoon on your damp but exposed arm, leg, stomach, whatever and let them melt. Gently spread the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; and let it soak in for about 20 minutes or so. If it is too irritating for you, bail by rinsing, then just put on the oil after you leave the tub. Or put oil on while in the tub instead and rinse it off after 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do the above, these bags will last you a long, long time and become and even better value then they already are by buying 32 lbs. at a time (offered elsewhere here on Amazon). You can save some money that way.</li>
    <li> I received salts in a timely manner, they are as describe. I use it for soaking my body after a hard day at work and for me it&#x27;s very relaxing.</li>
    <li> It was ok. Better cheaper brands though.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, IT REALLY DOES WONDERS FOR THE BODY</li>
    <li> Worked wonders!! I love it - always feel like a million bucks when i use it for soaking!</li>
    <li> Sorry this is a waste of money for me.......not effective for me</li>
    <li> Fabulous product and great service.  You can make magnesium oil by using one cup of distilled (pure) water to one cup of magnesium flakes; place in spray bottle and spray either the abdomen or bottom of the feet.  You can also use the magnesium &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; to make lotion.  The conditions this helps with seem to be endless.</li>
    <li> These are simply the best magnesium chloride flakes I have used!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after learning how to make my own magnesium oil and lotion. My boyfriend swears by this lotion for sleeping great at night. It&#x27;s also great to use in the bath for sore muscles.</li>
    <li> Excellent service!  Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Using this for the last month instead of deodorant...so far so good!</li>
    <li> received quickly. too soon to relate effects.</li>
    <li> Great at getting rid of muscle aches and pains and helps reduce swelling, only complaint is that it does sting a little depending on where you put it, but the aches and pains it gets rid of far surpass the annoying sting. The bag goes along way. I made magnesium oil, 1/2 cup flakes to a 1/2 cup distilled water. Works great in a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I know what you&#x27;re thinking...this is really spendy bath salt. At least, that&#x27;s what I was thinking. However, my ND recommended magnesium supplements along with magnesium baths due to stress, headaches, and body aches. Bathing in these is very different from your typical Epsom salts. For one, I am completely relaxed and sleepy after bathing with these (due to the effect of the magnesium). I also notice that my body is more buoyant, as in my arms snap up to float on top when I&#x27;m lying in the tub. Perhaps this means they&#x27;re more concentrated? Really great stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality!!! Love it! Great results!</li>
    <li> I enjoy much improved sleep with Ancient Minerals magnesium that I boil in a 1:1 ratio with water to make my own magnesium oil.  I finally finished off my four pound bag, and decided to go for the bigger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make magnesium oil spray bottles as gifts for my family, and everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> AllVia, SWANSON AND LIFE FLO are ZECHSTEIN and the EXACT same product!! These other companies that say Zechstein have much better prices for the exact same product. Ancient Minerals has issues. You are better off switching to AllVia, Life Flo or SWANSON and saving money plus supporting better companies.</li>
    <li> I use it as a nutrient source in baths as I found  getting enough magnesium from pills had a side effect. The runs.  This seems to be good for softer skin also.</li>
    <li> I have been noticing that prices are sky rocketing on anything healthy. I used to be able to buy something like this for about $15. The bag literally says.. pour in the whole bag for an eczema soak.. REALLY? An 8lb  $40 SOAK? I have used epsom salts and this.. to be honest I cannot tell a difference. 8 pound bag is not as much as one would think. I was able to put the whole bag in a gallon glass jar. Personally, I think we are getting reamed by these prices and claims. I can remember 20 years ago the box on epsom salt said add 1/4 cup per tub.. now it says 2 cups, why? Same with minerals like these. I can remember when the gallon of bleach said one teaspoon per gallon of water.. now it says a cup... wake up folks. NIGARI is a magnesium chloride additive for tofu.. straight magnesium chloride.. do a google search for NIGARI Solution &amp; save yourself a lot of cash..</li>
    <li> Dr. Mark Sircus, OMD. DM, wrote of the use of this product in his 2011 book (purchased from Amazon).  We blend 1 cup of the Magnesium flakes with one cup of distilled water-stir til dissolved with a chopstick- in a glass container.  For main use, 4 ounce blue glass spray bottles are used.to apply per directions.  Often, after application, a homemade coconut oil skin balm is smoothed over top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, the  mix is used in a tub bath for a really restful sleep.  It seems to reduce the pain of osteoarthritis in my hands after using the weed whacker and tiller in my gardens.</li>
    <li> perfect for making your own mag oil</li>
    <li> Great seller, great product. This truly helps with pain it relaxes those muscles really well.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic that transdermal magnesium would work. But this proved me wrong.. One month of daily foot baths with this and my constant headaches and migraine incidents have gone way down!</li>
    <li> Buy it. You&#x27;ll love it! It stops soreness and stiffness of muscles after workouts or strained muscles. It&#x27;s good for just a healthy relaxing soak as well.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I use it in my bath along with Epsom Salts to help maintain a better magnesium level in my body.</li>
    <li> Great product. Whether I use them in a bath or to soak my feet I feel wonderful afterwards. I have recommend this product to my friends including one struggling with cancer. She also feels that it has made a difference.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. I bought an 8 pound bag of Ancient Minerals magnesium chloride flakes several months ago, and used it almost daily, for foot soaks, and as a spray-on home-made &amp;#34;oil.&amp;#34;  I think it did its job, as my atrial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias were abated, I was less hyper, more calm, fell asleep faster, slept better. I was also using CALM oral drink once a day.&lt;br /&gt;Just now, I looked on the Amazon site to purchase another bag of Ancient Minerals, only  to find that the price of the bag I paid around $38 for is now around $105  --- that is 23/4 times what it was a few months ago. Obviously, I am not going to be buying a second bag. So, good product, but ...no thanks. That&#x27;s extortion.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite!</li>
    <li> Best bath salts. Amazing. Highly recommend. soothes sore muscles and makes skin soft while relaxing you. Have purchased this several times.</li>
    <li> Life saving. I love Ancient Minerals and am a huge believer in Magnesium baths for stress, aches, pains, relief of depression, and overall better health. I had a few minor health issues this year and this product was incredibly helpful. It&#x27;s nice to use with the oil as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Just what I wanted.</li>
