      <li>He told me that he&#x27;d go over it many time with the razor</li>
      <li>so I looked respectable, toss the thing in a briefcase and run into a washroom at the airport or before a meeting to spiffy up, and although it was not as close as blades, it was acceptable and durable and convenient.</li>
      <li>and im sure you have read into it.</li>
      <li>I have used cheaper electric razors that do a better job, save your money.</li>
      <li>But the thing that please me the most was that my face was not irritated after 12 minutes of shaving.</li>

      <li>and im sure you have read into it.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t get more if you pay more thats for sure.</li>
      <li>This has to be the best deal going as it came with not just a second set of heads (blades) but also the beard trimmer attachment.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll say this is a pretty good razor if you are not too picky with wanting a very clean shave.</li>
      <li>If you have fine or thinner facial hair this will work excellently for you.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I upgraded from a 5 year old Philips (not sure what model). This shaves just about the same for me. I have had it for 6 months now. The only good thing about it is that it is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I switched back to my handheld. This find not work better than my hand held in my opinion. Doesn&#x27;t shave well if growth has built up so Ai think you have to shave daily for this yo work well. Has a nice look and comfortable shave and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Very well and will recommend my friends to buy when the price is lower.</li>
    <li> For those folks who have a thick beard, this razor will more than disappoint you. I had an older Norelco razor (older version of Philips Norelco PT730/46 Shaver 3500) that wasn&#x27;t wet/dry, and was pleased with its results so i decided to give a wet/dry one a go. My older razor wasn&#x27;t the most powerful razor, but it held its charge and could shave even my thick beard. This razor is about half the power of my old razor. I have to go over my beard multiple times to even get something that approximates a shave. If I do not shave with this everyday, the razor will not, no matter how many times I try, shave off my two day old beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a thin beard or are blond, this razor will be perfectly fine for you, otherwise, get something stronger.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it, it shaved the beard clear, and no hurt. A very good daily shaver to use and live with.</li>
    <li> Excellent and excellent service from supplier</li>
    <li> Rest razor blade love the close</li>
    <li> i like it so much and buy for my whole family</li>
    <li> So I snagged this little guy when amazon had the $20 off coupons. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. And better yet, the same shaver with \\&quot;bonus replacement head\\&quot; package cost the SAME! And the coupon was still applicable. So I left the metaphorical door at $75 after tax. Not bad considered replacement heads are $20-30 seperately. Let me first start this off by saying yes, I am reviewing this as of day one of owning this product. I realize it takes 2-3 weeks for a man&#x27;s beard/face to properly acclimate from any system of shaving to another. So I will periodically update this review until two weeks have passed and will shave every day with it. I must say, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this guy. But lets go through all the iffy/bad things about it first. When I first started using the shaver, it was really quiet. And by quiet I mean, \\&quot;where is the motor on this thing?\\&quot; Compared to the foil razors I&#x27;ve used that buzz like a chainsaw and actually vibrate like mad in your hand, this thing was quiet and felt very very weak. I even charged it fully upon opening the box. Regardless I managed to get 75% of my face in one 12 minute session. The handle is very weird and contoured in a way I would never choose. Also what I thought was important to many: there is no plug-and-shave feature with this razor. WIth both Foil razors I had they had charge ports on the bottom where you could stick the plug in and shave while directly connected to power. The charger is built in to the cradle for this device. There are two studs on that must make contact with two points on the shaver in order to charge. I miss that feature and wish It was on this. And lastly, there are no self-sharpening blades like advertised on the Foil razors (now I&#x27;m just looking for things to complain about). So in short, there&#x27;s not much I can find fault with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this I was using a double edge safety razor. I loved using it but it was just extremely hard on my skin. I have thick hair but delicate skin. Go figure. So shaving daily was out of the question. I would shave then let the stubble grow out and then shave a week later. And I&#x27;d still manage to nick myself every now and again. So I needed something gentler on my skin. I used a Foil shaver a while back. Two actually. I really wanted to give that style of electric shaver a shot. One was a Panasonic and the other was a Braun- both in the $50-$80 range. My issue with both of these electric shavers was that they irritated my skin like nothing else! I remember them failing horribly at getting all the hair on my face and no matter how many passes I made with the correct technique, it would just cut so close to the skin (without getting the hair) that my face would be red and feel itchy. So I figured the Rotary shavers would be the same. I was wrong. Sure they are less powerful and (I&#x27;ve heard) don&#x27;t shave as close as the Foil shavers do. But my first impression with this razor was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll talk about the positives. Anesthetics are great, not going to talk about them too much. I&#x27;m a fan of electric blue and clean design so we&#x27;ll leave it at that. My first shave felt great. I sprayed some gel into my hands and lathered up. I didn&#x27;t want to try it in the shower since the other Foil razors I&#x27;ve used said they were shower friendly and shaving immediately became harder under the stream of water and humidity. So I cleansed my face of oils/dirt, lathered up with foam, and then shaved as I normally do. Except this time I&#x27;m making circular strokes as I shave (per the instructions). Fyi, the blades are spinning counter-clockwise. My knee-jerk reaction was that making circular motions in any direction would be the same, but I think it&#x27;s more efficient when you are making circular strokes in the opposite direction. so looking at yourself in the mirror you would be making clockwise motions along your face. But the thing that please me the most was that my face was not irritated after 12 minutes of shaving. Now, about 75-80%of my face was stripped of hair (the direction of my hair growth is a big factor in that result). But what pleased me what expecting the feeling of razor burn but it not being there. I couldn&#x27;t believe there was not even a minor feeling of irritation. In fact, I&#x27;m touching my face now and the result length is something I would definitely be fine with on an everyday basis. Now on a special date or night, I would definitely use my triple blade or double edge safety razor for that unmatched closeness of shaving. But again, if you&#x27;re like me, you don&#x27;t want to be doing that everyday. The replacement for the heads is recommended at about 12 months. We all try to push our objects past the recommended usage- try to make every last penny of that cost count. But if that&#x27;s the manufacturer&#x27;s recommended replacement date, I have to say that&#x27;s not as bad as I was expecting. The product is waterproof so you can use it in the shower or rinse it while on. I like that the head is so easily detachable. Someone in the comments said they put that in the dishwasher and let it rinse on the high heat cycle. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a great cleaning method once every 3-4 months when stuff really builds up over time. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it weekly. It still is a fragile disposable part. The interface of the shaver unit is plastic but feels like thin plastic coating something. It feels almost exactly like one of those Lifeproof cases that you buy for your smart phone. That weird frontal plastic face. It&#x27;s nice, I guess that&#x27;s how they make it waterproof. Charge time like the box says is an hour for 50 minutes of use. Power charge option in case you need to shave real quick. I don&#x27;t know why this is a \\&quot;feature\\&quot; though. I think everyone knows you can charge the device for X number of minutes and get X-5 minutes out of it.  Anyway, will add to this review two weeks from now.of my face was stripped of hair (the direction of my hair growth is a big factor in that result).

    <li> I think the price of this item should be lower.</li>
    <li> Birthday gift for friend</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Valentine&#x27;s gift to my boyfriend. I didn&#x27;t hear any complaints from him and assumed it worked well. but noticed he would miss the hairs where underneath the chin and neck meet. He told me that he&#x27;d go over it many time with the razor but it wouldn&#x27;t cut. Till recently I watched him use the shaver on his entire face.. It was so horrible to watch. As he ran the shaver over his checks and chin, it missed so many hairs! I was thinking it was gonna all be gone once he ran the shaver over his face. As I continued to watch so many short hairs were still left on his face. It&#x27;s too late for me to return the product but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the razor. Shaving with an electric shaver should be this difficult right?!  Save yourself the money if your facial hair is on the thicker side. a good electric razor shouldn&#x27;t make shaving a chore</li>
    <li> Good ,and the price is so cheap</li>
    <li> My brother in law really likes it.</li>
    <li> Razor cuts nice, but not better than my old one</li>
    <li> great shaver  best I have ever had</li>
    <li> If I compare with the old 7110x, the 1150x is too noisy and not really smooth, even that it has a good design and good power consumption index.</li>
    <li> best Norelco razor I have owned.  works best with clean beard.  close shave, less time than before and easy to clean.  only difference from my old one is that the compartment under the heads, being more flexible for obvious reasons, doesn&#x27;t contain the beard shavings so I have to lean over the sink more while shaving.  I imagine that is what makes it easy to clean.  no worries though, simple rinse and away the mess goes.  either way, very good razor.  been a Norelco user for life, and that life has now been extended.</li>
    <li> Bought for my dad as a gift. He loved it and using it with his normal shave gel was an even better shave than an expensive hand razor. Charges great and lasts more than enough time to shave. AND IT CAME WITH AN EXTRA HEAD FOR FREE!!! what a bargain. I am going to get one for myself now. I hate shaving but this thing works so well and is so easy that it might be less of a chore.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t speak to longevity since he has only been using it for a month now but so far is great for someone who shaves everyday.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the money. Works equally well wet or dry.</li>
    <li> It waa very easy work and cleaning</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco products for over 50 years. I estimate I have purchased 10-12 different Norelco products over that period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the last one.  It is going back today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOISE. It is noisy and loud. Instead of a clean, smooth, whirring sound of high precision blades meshing at high speed, like a turbine or the gear set on a great car, this monstrosity emits a high-pitched whining moan that is so loud my wife walked across 50 feet of house to ask what the noise was. The sound is very distracting and generates low confidence in the quality of engineering in its design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHEAP. The product lacks the usual heft. IT is light, but feels cheaply manufactured. IS Norelco in that much need of cost savings to go to the extent of ruining it &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; superior engineering?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT SHAVE? Instead of the usual fast, clean shave I have expected and received for, let&#x27;s say, the previous 5,000 to 10,000 or so Norelco shaves, it got a face and neck covered by patchy, short stubble after 5 minutes of moving this weed whacker over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST FOR LAST. It came with a card offering a 2 1/2 year warranty if you register this product on line. Great. However, the product model number (6100) and the bar codes were both rejected by the website as not being recognized Norelco products. The product number on the box had been taped over. Could this be a clue? Is this a knock-off from some unnamed place where cloning great European engineering is a national core competency?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this mix-up is part of the &amp;#34;rebranding&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;relabeling&amp;#34; scheme described in the product description on Amazon. BEWARE. Read the Norelco product descriptions carefully, and walk away when you see a change in product numbering as part of the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, I hope this s the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DENOUEMENT. When I filled out the return product email on Amazon just now, the product was listed as being supplied toAmazon by &amp;#34;HappyFace.&amp;#34; My international rip off theory looks like a better an better guess as to the root cause of my dissatisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just goes to show you what a happy world we live in. This product was designed to make somebody &amp;#34;happy.&amp;#34; It just was not the consumer.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it very much</li>
    <li> My father likes it, except that it can not be charged directly, but through a bottom. He told me that, if he ever goes a biz trip, he has to take both chargeable bottom and shaver together, which is not convenient. He does not know why it was designed like this.</li>
    <li> It is very good and smooth but it leaves a few hairs on neck, battery lasts for ever!</li>
    <li> Just tried it today and wow it&#x27;s a lot quieter that my old remington, and yes it does give a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;My order included a Bonus replacement head and to my surprise in also came with the trimmer head. The charging base is very cool.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very clean shaven, body feeling very comfortable, and cheaper than Chinese territory!</li>
    <li> The Shaver does not live up to any standards, it bites your skin, leaves ingrown hairs, just not as good as they claim.  I returned it to Norelco under their 45 day money back guarantee, well within the 45 days, they confirmed they received it 9 weeks ago, yet their website and forms state that it takes 6-8 weeks for the check to arrive and what&#x27;s more is that they cannot even tell me if the check was mailed out or even cut, they just tell me to call back again after 10 weeks have passed. Now they tell me that they need to send me another paper form via US Mail.</li>
    <li> This shaver is okay, and the price is fair especially with extra head.  But...  the stand/charger is large, there is no battery display until it is about dead.  Side burn trimmer is an add on, a separate piece versus old pop-up.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, does the job but my husband said his old one was much better.  Shave is nice and the shaver is a nice weight.</li>
    <li> good shaver and good price.Though it&#x27;s a little noisy, I still love it very much.</li>
    <li> It is a perfect present for my man!</li>
    <li> By far the best electric razor I have ever used.  It is fast and gives a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> My second wet shaver works better than dry!! Easy to use design.</li>
    <li> Great shaver that gives a far closer shave than my last triple header.  Also the battery lasted for almost a full month, and that with my shaving daily.</li>
    <li> I like the older model better...</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it! Comparable to a 200 dollar shaver that I got him 10 years ago!</li>
    <li> This was my first electric shaver I have used in over 15 years. I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Fusion blades (the vibrating Fusion gives an excellent shave) but was tired of paying the high price for blades. I switched to the dollar shave club for several months and used their Executive blades. Not nearly as good as Fusion but much cheaper.  They consistently left me with irritation and cuts. So I decided to give electrics a try again and ordered this one since I had used Norelco years ago. I didn&#x27;t do my homework on this purchase and bought this since it was mid-priced and very popular. I used it for about 3 weeks and was never really satisfied. Dry shaves irritated my skin. Wet shaves were much better but did not meet my expectations. I&#x27;ll say this is a pretty good razor if you are not too picky with wanting a very clean shave. A wet shave with this was comfortable and generally pretty good. It is easy to use and clean. Since I started using electric again, I decided to read about other shavers. The Braun Series 7 and Panasonic Arc 5 kept coming up as excellent shavers. I decided to send this back and try a Braun Series 7 799cc (waterproof model). I have never used a foil shaver before this. The Braun gave me an incredibly close shave (honestly as close as a blade) with no irritation or cuts, wet or dry. I absolutely love the Braun and wish I found this years ago. The Braun cost me about $300 at Bed Bath and Beyond (the lowest price I could find). My final thought is this... Spend the extra money if you want a really good shave. I shave daily so making it a pleasant experience is well worth the money. I highly recommend the Braun 799cc. Well worth the investment.    A side note - it&#x27;s hard to get a true rating for this Norelco based on the Amazon reviews. There are very many low ratings based on customers not receiving rebates and very many reviews from people in China giving it a five star rating because they think it makes a great gift. These reviews are not based onthe performance of the shaver and should be deleted.</li>
    <li> Husband love it - great shaver. Good for kissing him after he shaves.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really not as good as I expected, it looks so cheap</li>
    <li> I have owned Norelco shavers for years. My last one is about 20 years old, every two years I have replaced the Nicad batterys. New shaver blades yearly. This Norelco beats my old one. The closeness of the shave, the ability to use preshave  and the way the head can get close to trim around ears, in ears makes this the best Norelco I have ever owned. Hopefully the lithium battery pack will be available at a later date so it can be replaced when needed. The charging stand is a little funky. It takes 1hour to fully charge, instead of /2 hour for older model. Battery life has been three weeks of shaving, which is nice, which means will not need charging stand when I vacation. Sadly no travel case is included. However do get a useful trimmer  that snaps on when you take off shaving head. And the trimmer works well. Built in trimmer on old Norelco was useless. Progress has been made!</li>
    <li> I dont see the difference with cheaper models. I have to go over and over the same spot in order to get it decent (not perfect) enough. I dont like it at all. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> not a daily shaver, but so far i only charge my battery once since the beginning</li>
    <li> good product. smooth shave.</li>
    <li> My previous razor for 10 or so years was a Norelco XL (can&#x27;t remember number) that I liked very well, ran for a long time, used the 55 heads. I could shave dry, get a decent shave so I looked respectable, toss the thing in a briefcase and run into a washroom at the airport or before a meeting to spiffy up, and although it was not as close as blades, it was acceptable and durable and convenient. All I wanted from an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new one does not work well dry at all for me. In order to get a decent shave it must be used wet with soap or gel. Also the thing MUST be cleaned after EVERY use or it hardly works at all. Now I understand all the 25 year old cool guys I worked with that always had a couple days of stubble and that&#x27;s fashionable nowadays. They have razors like mine that are inconvenient as hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you told me that I had to have a razor that needed to be used wet and needed to be cleaned meticulously after each use I would assume you were describing shaving with blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor may goes against the very reasons I chose electric 15 years ago: convenience, ease of use, decent quality shave, low maintenance. My only big plus for this versus my old NiCD razor is that the batteries stay charged for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just didn&#x27;t read the item description carefully before I bought this, but be sure it must be used wet and kept meticulously clean to work well, and forget about those quick washroom before meeting brush ups to get rid of 3pm shadow unless you have a hot towel and shaving cream handy.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and no issues with this shaver. My new favorite.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this slot he wishes it would get even closer but for an electric razor he really likes this one. He actually said this is the best one he has ever had</li>
    <li> Thank you good product.</li>
    <li> If you have fine or thinner facial hair this will work excellently for you. Myself on the other hand... I have thicker and manlier hair and the result is spotty. If you look at my picture it remover about 80% of my facial hair and I have to dig deep and hard on my face to achieve this. You will notice a blood spot on my face that doesn&#x27;t hurt by any stretch but does indicate that I have to push hard for the results you see. Leaves a smooth soft face after 45 minutes, but I&#x27;ll be returning this because I can shave with a straight blade in 25 minutes for the same smooth soft face and in 15 minutes with a regular shaver.</li>
    <li> This item is great ,I like it~</li>
    <li> I received it in Europe even earlier than I was told. This Philips Norelco is absolutely awesome and my husband is satisfied a lot too. Every word you hear in the ad is true, although I haven&#x27;t been previously convinced.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t get more if you pay more thats for sure. If youre hoping to replace your razor with this, you will not be able to, unless you go for that patchy look. You have to charge it with it on the stand, as the razor hooks into the stand, and the plug goes into the stand as well. This is only a minor nuisance as I&#x27;ve used it a lot and haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet. I have thick hair, and a lot of it, and this razor just does not do the job. It leaves red marks immediately after shaving (because you have to press hard just to try and get all the patches off) and leaves razor burn as well. Not good if you have sensitive skin. I have used cheaper electric razors that do a better job, save your money.</li>
    <li> It &#x27;s not powerful enough, and very tedious to switch the head.</li>
    <li> kinda futuristic... I had many Norelco / no doubt the best in electric razors......... I have had ALL the other........ back and forth el. razors have really vibration probs,,, they have to Stop to travel in the other direction...Norelco is Smooth,, circular motion........and impossible to beat Norelcos high quality........... and,, you can count on having it for a very long time........works on 110v and 220v.</li>
    <li> Does not do a clean cut.</li>
    <li> Nice Price! First choice among &amp;#60; USD 100 shaver.</li>
    <li> excellent shaver. very happy with it</li>
    <li> the shaver does not work as expected and very proudly explained in Philips advertisements/experts. This does not shave all the hair especially the chin. While shaving without using shaving lotion it hurts and starts pulling the hair after sometime.&lt;br /&gt;over all the product was dissapointing and i expected a lot more as a lot of reviews were positive.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco 1150X/40SP Shaver 6100 with bonus head.&lt;br /&gt;I have many models of Philips norelco and they all works just fine for about 2-3 year or more.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this one would work like other my old norelco shavers.&lt;br /&gt;+ Of this, for 89$ you get extra bonus head that costs 30$. You get best shaver for 60$ good deal i guess ;)</li>
    <li> It is good in quality and quick in delivery.</li>
    <li> very good quality very nice i recommended...........</li>
    <li> not bad. That&#x27;s nice if could be cheaper</li>
    <li> Gift for my other half, he loves it but it does miss some spots on his face.</li>
    <li> Sleek design makes easy to hold while shaving and tracks well to facial curves with flex blades.  Blade assembly easy to clean under running water.  Initial battery charge lasted 3 full weeks (expect more frequent as battery ages)...  overall I[&#x27;m well pleased with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I was shaving with a Philips Norelco dry razor, with less than satisfactory results.  Upon receiving my new Phillips Norelco shaver that can be used dry and wet, I have been using it with shaving cream and hot water and getting much better results.</li>
    <li> Just tried it today and wow it&#x27;s a lot quieter that my old remington, and yes it does give a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;My order included a Bonus replacement head and to my surprise in also came with the trimmer head. The charging base is very cool.</li>
    <li> It fits me well but the huge box even doesn&#x27;t include a fabric travel bag. It&#x27;s a design pity for this model.</li>
    <li> Everything is fine, I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Bought for husband.  Takes getting used to but is beginning to like it.</li>
    <li> Perfect shaver and fantastic price!</li>
    <li> My picky boy friend absolutely loves this razor. For once, a winner at Christmas!</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Received early. Son loves it.</li>
    <li> I think this razor is good, it is worth purchasing</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco has once again put a hand of cards of full house on the poker table and taking the win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product Is not only sleek and stylish it offers quality that is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you have seen, the shaver is a glossy blue, most beautiful look, yet it offers the quality that would expect to receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, what I want to tell you is about the shaving mechanism and its quality because that is what I was mostly intrigued with. I have short stubby hairs on certain sections of my chin and check, yet I have long, short and hard to trim hairs. I was amazed at the fact that this product will trim and shave both with ease. For you, who doesn&#x27;t like to read the manual, I will tell you that, the manual recommends that, as you shave, shave by making swirls. Small or large swirls or rotations, whatever one sounds apealling, doing so will allow the precision blade to trim off and then shave off small stubby hairs and larger longer hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend that you us gel shaving cream or any shaving cream, this will give you a smooth shaving experience and save you time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I will mention that it will take you atleast three tries to really get a good feel and handle on this product. Your probably wondering what Im talking about. Well, my first experience on trying this product was unsatisfactory, keep in mind that I have short and long stubby hair, so, I did not know how to use this product. In my first attempt to shave was not difficult, but I did feel that I left some spots with small short stubby hair. I was wrong, you need to wash your face after your done shaving, hence, you might have shaving cream and small hairs stay trapped in the foam, so, when you rub your face itl feel like you have short stubby hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lastly, when your done shaving you might fell a minor rash, not a big deal, this minor rash is normal for first time users. It takes atleast three shaves to accustom to this. After you finish, that minor rash goes away at about 4 minutes. then after you will feel that your cheeks and jaw area are smooth like that of a new born baby. This smoothness is due to the dual precision blade that cuts short and long stubby hair.&lt;br /&gt;  The Gyro flex 2D and Aquatec adds to the ability to receive a close and smooth shave. Gyro Flex 2D offers an inward tilt to the heads and the head allow for a pivot, both allows for a easy, close and near perfect experience on the chin, neck and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the details, I wont go over them, its all on the webpage and im sure you have read into it. If you have a girlfriend, wife, or simply like to look good, rest assured that you will receive some sort of compliment, either from the person your dating, your wife or simply yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I a satisfied with my purchase and I hope you will be too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Found a You tube video for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Link is below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;SvR72il_okUs. then after you will feel that your cheeks and jaw area are smooth like that of a new born baby.

    <li> Under powered.  Battery life seems short.</li>
    <li> great! easy to use and much cheaper than in China</li>
    <li> Maybe my expectations are too high for a low priced shaver. Takes forever to shave and does not do a real good job in the neck area. I normally have to supplement with a regular razor. For this reason I don&#x27;t use this electric shaver often.  I probably should have purchased a higher priced shaver.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it since the one I got before was broken just after 2 years. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice good shave like it</li>
    <li> Nice razor, could have come with travel bag.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with Norelco elec. razor! You have made me a future customer, thanks I might add what a lifesaver that razor was. You see I underwent a Dermatology application of the face, scalp &amp; arms that made me a Leper, honestly and that Norelco undulating action was all the facial skin would support. My wife &amp; I must appear in our facility dining room each night, me clean shaven. Norelco is my razor, Amazon is my retailor, thanks again ---GCZ</li>
    <li> so good,the price is so cheaper.在中国的商场需要2700人民币，这一比，便宜好多好多</li>
    <li> Basically a good shaver. Not as close as advertised. I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor I am a barber  for the last 52 years. One of my custormers told me about this razor he loves it . The razor preformes ok but I have to be onest with you i am used to a close shave .I am having trouble  under the chin area and jaw bone it seems to miss places I should have purchased the better modell. Iwill recomend this razor to my customers  lI beleive it is a good value for the money.I think if i research your top of the line norelco .i most likely will purchase that rasor.I am a barber at this location for the past 51 years  Thank you  Santo Sciortino</li>
    <li> Liked the razor except it did not have a trimmer.</li>
    <li> SHAVER IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT, EXCEPT THE PACKAGE DID NOT CONTAIN THE EXTRA BONUS SHAVING HEAD ... I HOPE THAT CAN BE REMEDIATED!</li>
    <li> I get a close shave from this shaver ever time and it keep a charge for over 20 shaves. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied a shopping experience, product quality is very good, very satisfied with the speed of logistics</li>
    <li> Help my father to buy. hope he likes it</li>
    <li> schnell und schön leise&lt;br /&gt;integrierter Langhaar-Schneider fehlt leider</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He didn&#x27;t even use it yet.  I can&#x27;t get that ridiculous stand to stay up!  I think they could have made the stand a little better.  It is such light plastic.  I had to prop something behind it to stand erect.  I hope it does what he wants it to do as far as shaving!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it and wish to return it.</li>
    <li> This Norelco shaves closer than my older one. I also like the charging stand better. My previous Norelco served me for three years. I hope this one will last as least that long.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE OPENED IT UP RIGHT AWAY OUT OF EXCITMENT! WHAT A FAILER....IT DID NOT CUT HIS FACIAL HAIR VERY WELL AT ALL! HE WENT OVER AND OVER NUMEROUS TIMES AND IT LEFT SO MUCH HAIR BEHIND! HOPE IT WAS JUST A DEFECTED ONE BEACUSE PHILLIPS NORELCO IS A VERY KNOW BRAND....TO BAD IT GAVE HIM A BAD FACIAL HAIR CUT LOL</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good choice, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I gave it a one star because that&#x27;s the minimum you can rate it. This is a piece of junk. This razor is useless and leaves your face patchy. I tried it with and without shaving cream. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect a close shave.  Tried with shaving cream.  Did get closer shave but gummed up the head&#x27;s had to replace them after third shave as I could not clean out the heads.  When I tried they fell apart.  Not a very good shaver.  Would not recommend anyone to buy.</li>
    <li> If only there were ZERO star reviews.  I have used Norelco coolskin products for years.  They have discontinued them.  The one I bought in 2011 they have already discontinued the heads for, so they are available from exploiters for upwards of $70 (retail was $35).  With my two year old head I figured time to get a new coolskin - but no such thing anymore.  Norelco told me that this was the &#x27;upgrade&#x27; for the shaver I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it is the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had - which is because it doesn&#x27;t come remotely close to cutting anywhere near the skin.  No damage, no sensitivity and NO POINT IN USING IT.  I shaved after with my 2 year old, worn out HS8020 and got tons more stubble removed.  Shave lasts about 5 hours with this, 10 with HS8020.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the old Coolskin had an open head - cut hair dropped through, or rinsed out easily - great if you shave over a sink as I always do.  New one has a closed in head.  So if you make the mistake of trying to use it with any kind of foam (it IS an Aquatech) - then it simply whisks the foam into a nice thick mess which insulates you even further from getting a decent shave.  Sold as wet/dry - only works dry and is not good even then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco - bring back Coolskin with Nivea, it was a great system and I&#x27;d happily pay three times the cost of this useless device to have a shaver which really works wet again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW:  Dropping supplies for a 3 year old shaver - real bad, that policy needs to change too!</li>
    <li> They call it a &amp;#34;2D Electric Razor&amp;#34; so I refer to it as my Homer razor since they must be marketing to cartoons characters. You&#x27;d think 3D would be a more appealing description when talking about your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this design much better than my previous Norelco, which was more of the classic design (without the floating head). This design really does follow the curves of the face better and also makes getting under the nose easier -- I guess most people would refer to that as the mustache. I do not use an electric shaver as my daily shaver -- I only use it when I run out of time. You are supposed to train your face to be use to an electric shaver so perhaps this Norelco has more to offer then I allow it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand that it comes with is super-nice. It&#x27;s not the auto-washing tub-thing, but just a nice stand -- much nicer than having plug in a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beefs:&lt;br /&gt;- The Power Supply for the charger sticks out of the wall, I wish it would &#x27;hang down&#x27; so it was more-flush (flusher?) to the wall.&lt;br /&gt;- The Power &amp;#34;button&amp;#34; is just a flat area on front of the shaver. I have to look at the shaver to turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;- Kobe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: Although this will work in the shower the instructions say you get the best performance with a dry face. Going as far as saying you should wait and hour (maybe they said 30 min?) after a shower before shaving.</li>
    <li> Love it i will buy over and over.</li>
    <li> It does cut well! but still leaves a bit of stubble (small signs of hairs in my pores) behind which of course I&#x27;m not too happy about.</li>
    <li> This shaver shaves pretty well. I use it during the weekends, but during the week, when I want more precise shave, I still use manual razors instead.</li>
    <li> Not a very good razor but you get what you pay for... To bad I have always shaved with a straight razor and got tired of it so I researched and found this one. Don&#x27;t like it ..</li>
    <li> Disappointing after having used the 3D Senso Touch.  My mistake for wanting to spend less.</li>
    <li> To be clear, I ordered the 1150x/40SP Shaver 6100 with bonus set of heads. This has to be the best deal going as it came with not just a second set of heads (blades) but also the beard trimmer attachment.  Perhaps that was an accidental insert, it isn&#x27;t mentioned on the box...  Anyway, my concern when I opened the package was how light the shaver is. I have had a Philips 3 head shaver for 5 years of faithful service and it has never let me down, always providing a close-enough shave with a reassuring heft. Just lately the batteries won&#x27;t hold a charge and the blades came up for replacement. It was cheaper, not to mention easier, to buy a new unit than replace both of those. As I said, this unit is so light that I was worried about it breaking the first time I used it. 2 weeks of very nice (closer than my old shaver) shaves later I have gotten used to the light weight and can say I am entirely satisfied. Only dry shaves for me so far but perhaps I&#x27;ll try wet-shaves when I get a chance. I do like the new shave heads with their multi-shaped perforations. I have not found any area of my face that needs particular attention, my old shaver had problems with longer neck hairs for example.  Not to say there aren&#x27;t some flaws: you can rinse the unit under hot water to clean but there is no exit for the trapped shavings so you WILL need to remove the blade-carrier (easy pull up operation) to clean. The charging stand is also flimsy but seems up to the challenge.  Overall I am delighted.</li>
