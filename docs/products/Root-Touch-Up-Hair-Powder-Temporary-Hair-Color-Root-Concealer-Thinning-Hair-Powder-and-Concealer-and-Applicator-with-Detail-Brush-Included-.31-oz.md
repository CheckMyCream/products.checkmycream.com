      <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Goes on very easily and builds to the amount of coverage you want and/or need.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best root cover-up I have ever tried, and I have tried them all.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
      <li>It works FABULOUS!  </li>
      <li>Thank you for making such a wonderful product!!!</li>
      <li>I try to keep on top of coloring, but sometimes I just don&#x27;t have time or money to get to the salon.  </li>
      <li>I love that it is inexpensive and portable.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;light blonde&amp;#34; would be a better choice for platinum gals?</li>
      <li>My wife is so in love with this product.</li>
      <li>This product blends naturally and matches up great.  </li>
      <li>It is a powder, so it can come off easily.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and does not fade.  </li>
      <li>Product delivered very quickly.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t always fit my hair appt into my schedule.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t like to wash my hair everyday and this is the perfect solution!!  </li>
      <li>Covered my gray roots until a touch-up appointment became available.  </li>
      <li>I no longer feel rushed to get back to the salon.. and my hair looks great.  </li>
      <li>Goes on easy and quick and no problem at all with my curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I had highlights in May then enjoyed a few great beach and pool days.</li>
      <li>I tried the warm blonde and absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>The powder is bright yellow</li>
      <li>I love the warm blonde color in the winter because I can go so much longer in between touch ups with my stylist.</li>
      <li>I have the cool blonde for summer and the warm blonde for winter and love them both!</li>
      <li>I am usually sensitive to most products, but not this one.  </li>
      <li>This is like magic fairy dust that gives your hair a natural, sun-kissed look without paying hundreds of dollars in the salon.</li>
      <li>The rest of the time I&#x27;m able to touch up my roots seamlessly with rootflag.</li>
      <li>However, this powder was worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Just not the right shade.</li>
      <li>the concept is wonderful but the color looks a little orange when I am outside in the sun.</li>
      <li>She had about a good inch and half of roots</li>
      <li>Really surprised me - this works and is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>As far as consistency and coverage, it was fine.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The last thing I wanted to do is pay for more highlights, so I tried Rootflage.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t tell anyone ;)</li>
      <li>Rootflage does exactly as promised...</li>
      <li>But, this product did EXACTLY what I hoped it would.  </li>
      <li>Rootflage is genius, and is an absolute saviour for those between-appointment times when you just can&#x27;t stand your roots!</li>
      <li>I have tried several temporary fixes for my gray roots and this one does the trick and is also a great dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>In fact, I use t more as a dry shampoo than as cover up for the roots though that works too.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend to anyone that wants to wait longer in between salon visits!</li>
      <li>Color was a perfect match for my warm blonde base with light blonde highlights.  </li>
      <li>&amp; it really doesn&#x27;t blend your roots at all.  </li>
      <li>I guess I should have gone for the light blonde.</li>
      <li>It has now been 2 whole months since she has gone to the hair salon</li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work for me.</li>
      <li>It really helps stretch out my salon appointments.</li>
      <li>It really did cover up my 1 1/2 inch grow out from my highlights.  </li>
      <li>I would highly suggest you try this!</li>
      <li>I was skeptical about how natural it would look, however it matched my hair perfectly!</li>
      <li>The mineral powder application is very easy to use and I can use as much or as little as I need.</li>
      <li>I like to mix the Warm Blonde, Cool Blonde, and Light Blonde to match my mix of highlights and it never let me down.</li>
      <li>It really does temporarily highlight the new growth and make the roots blend in with the highlights.  </li>
      <li>My hair grows quickly, and I felt like I was at the salon every third week getting my roots done.  </li>
      <li>A friend had given Rootflage to me to try and now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>Watch my demo using warm blonde for highlights and working as a dry shampoo at the same time:   http://youtu.be/SnzlHc7hiyQ</li>
      <li>The warm blonde lightens things just enough, and a side benefit is that it works as a dry shampoo, too.</li>
      <li>Rootflage provides a very natural looking coverage for roots.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
      <li>Finally, a product that REALLY works to hide my overgrown roots!</li>
      <li>We have save $400 now so far!</li>
      <li>The packaging is small enough I can justify carrying it with me on the road and the results are spectacular.</li>
      <li>Shipping was so fast, we got it next day.  </li>
      <li>The powder went all over my hair and didn&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t always use the same products as people with straight hair.  </li>
      <li>I wish there were a less yellow version of the blonde range, but even so, it looks better than roots growing out before I can get to the hairdresser.</li>
      <li>The helpful tip my sister gave me is to blend it in, just like foundation, blending is key to achieve a natural look!</li>
      <li>If you get it anywhere near your scalp, your scalp will be yellow.  </li>
      <li>Works well to cover roots but is very &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; and you can see it on your scalp if you don&#x27;t apply carefully.</li>
      <li>I was so happy that it arrived the day before I was leaving on a trip, ad took it with me, but was disappointed that it did not really work very well.</li>
      <li>Somehow, with my busy schedule, a few more weeks usually go by from that day till my next hair appointment.</li>
      <li>I open the base and use a makeup brush that is more precise</li>
      <li>This works better than any of the other products I have tried and is certainly a lot better than my past desperate self-highlights!</li>
      <li>My budget is tight and I don&#x27;t normally spend money on things like this, but this is way cheaper than a trip to the salon!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sorry, this was way too light for my hair.  Looked very yellow and fake.</li>
    <li> Really surprised me - this works and is easy to use.  Color is great for my multi highlighted hair!  Will suggest this product for my sister to use on her roots!</li>
    <li> The powder went all over my hair and didn&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
    <li> Covers your scalp, not your roots! :(</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have purchased Rootflage. Good root coverage. I have tried several temporary fixes for my gray roots and this one does the trick and is also a great dry shampoo. Product delivered very quickly.</li>
    <li> I tried the warm blonde and absolutely LOVE this product. I would recommend it to anyone and know they would love it! Just use it once and you will be hooked.</li>
    <li> This is a truly amazing product!  I was a little skeptical at first because I have really curly hair and I can&#x27;t always use the same products as people with straight hair.  Since I can&#x27;t comb through my hair when it is dry I didn&#x27;t know how it would be to apply it.  It works FABULOUS!  Goes on easy and quick and no problem at all with my curly hair.  Finally a product I can use between coloring my hair!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Goes on very easily and builds to the amount of coverage you want and/or need.  No muss, no fuss.  Covered my gray roots until a touch-up appointment became available.  Color was a perfect match for my warm blonde base with light blonde highlights.  I admit I was skeptical about this as I&#x27;ve tried Joan Rivers touch-up hair powder in blonde and was very disappointed, and $40 poorer.  However, this powder was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Rootflage is a life saver!  Covers the roots, looks AMAZING and saves time and money!  I can extend my coloring by 2-3 weeks!  Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> The color of the powder is almost a perfect match for my lightest highlights (I have two tones in my hair.) I gave it only four stars because the powder doesn&#x27;t come out the brush like it is supposed to so maybe mine is defective. I open the base and use a makeup brush that is more precise so it works out well to apply it that way. To get it so stick all day you may want to spritz a little hair spray or use something a little sticky before brushing it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do be careful not to get it on your part as it can look yellowish there if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does the trick, especially while waiting that last week before going to the salon.</li>
    <li> I could not get the product to cover the areas I was trying to cover.  Hardly anything came out of the bottle.  I think I will have to figure out a way how to use it with a tiny brush instead.  I was so happy that it arrived the day before I was leaving on a trip, ad took it with me, but was disappointed that it did not really work very well.</li>
    <li> Orange.  Not much else to say.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work for me. I do all my ordering online so sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to really tell the color. the concept is wonderful but the color looks a little orange when I am outside in the sun. I guess I should have gone for the light blonde. I would return it but it is too difficult for me to get to the post office.</li>
    <li> Not sure how it works for other non-natural blondes out there, but I swear there always comes a day between hair appointments when out of a sudden I look in the mirror and realize- my roots look awful!! Somehow, with my busy schedule, a few more weeks usually go by from that day till my next hair appointment. Since I started using Rootflage, I don&#x27;t have to dread the awkward dark root period anymore. Rootflage provides a very natural looking coverage for roots. It&#x27;s easy to apply and blends perfectly with the shade of my hair. Another benefit- on days when I run out of time to wash my hair (or, hm, get lazy), I use Rootflage to freshen up the hair and take the oiliness away. Just don&#x27;t tell anyone ;)</li>
    <li> This is by far the best root cover-up I have ever tried, and I have tried them all.  It is easy to apply and does not fade.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a little touch-up between hair appointments.</li>
    <li> Finally, a product for those times when you just can&#x27;t get to the salon. My hair grows quickly, and I felt like I was at the salon every third week getting my roots done.  I almost gave up on doing my hair because between time &amp; money, I was spending a lot of both and managing my hair appointments in my already busy life was getting ridiculous.  But, now, I finally have something to hold me over in between visits.  This product blends naturally and matches up great.  It&#x27;s a perfect solution...and one I&#x27;ve been waiting for.  I no longer feel rushed to get back to the salon.. and my hair looks great.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My wife is so in love with this product. I got this for my wife as she was having to do her roots every month for $200+ each time by the time you get color, cut and tip.  I thought she could try this product and see if it would work for her.  Shipping was so fast, we got it next day.  She had about a good inch and half of roots and it worked amazingly! It looked like she just got her roots touched up.  It has now been 2 whole months since she has gone to the hair salon and she is still rockin&#x27; the ROOT FLAGE.  We have save $400 now so far! Thank you for making such a wonderful product!!!</li>
    <li> I am a natural dark blond with blonde highlights and now some gray at my temples. I try to keep on top of coloring, but sometimes I just don&#x27;t have time or money to get to the salon.  Rootflage to the rescue!  It really does temporarily highlight the new growth and make the roots blend in with the highlights.  And best of all, it covers up those sneaky gray hairs at my temples! Thank you Rootflage!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  In fact, I use t more as a dry shampoo than as cover up for the roots though that works too.  I just don&#x27;t like to wash my hair everyday and this is the perfect solution!!  I gave this product a 4 because the casing that protects the brush broke.  As a result, I can&#x27;t replace the cap without the brush getting messed up.  However, I&#x27;m thinking mine is probably just defective.  I would highly suggest you try this!</li>
    <li> Finally, a product that REALLY works to hide my overgrown roots! I have 3 kids and never enough time to get to the salon to repair my dark roots in a timely fashion. You know the stage when you have made your hair appointment...but it is still weeks away...and ALL you want to do is put your hair in a ponytail every single day to mask the roots? This stuff is incredible. Shake it on your roots, run your fingers through it, and you can actually wear your hair down instead of up! Rootflage is genius, and is an absolute saviour for those between-appointment times when you just can&#x27;t stand your roots!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a brunette who Loves my blonde highlights. I travel all the time for work. Can&#x27;t always fit my hair appt into my schedule. Using RootFlage (warm base) has made my life so much easier. I dont have to worry about my roots looking bad. Not only does RootFlage cover the dark growth it makes my hair look thicker. Its a winner!</li>
    <li> I had highlights in May then enjoyed a few great beach and pool days. While my highlighted hair lightened up with the sun and chlorine, my roots remained dark. The last thing I wanted to do is pay for more highlights, so I tried Rootflage. It worked like a charm! This is like magic fairy dust that gives your hair a natural, sun-kissed look without paying hundreds of dollars in the salon. I think I&#x27;m good until Fall--sorry hairdresser!</li>
    <li> Waste of money ! Just turns your scalp a god awfully yellow.</li>
    <li> I love this product! As a busy mom with 3 kids it can be hard to get my salon appointments scheduled in a timely manner. I&#x27;m usually off by a week or two. Rootflage helps me between appointments when my roots are showing through. The mineral powder application is very easy to use and I can use as much or as little as I need. Ingenious!</li>
    <li> works ok ....not impressed</li>
    <li> Watch my demo using warm blonde for highlights and working as a dry shampoo at the same time:   http://youtu.be/SnzlHc7hiyQ</li>
    <li> Save your money doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> It works but it&#x27;s quite messy, I rather buy the spray type.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Great for touchups between appointments.  It is a powder, so it can come off easily.</li>
    <li> Works well to cover roots but is very &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; and you can see it on your scalp if you don&#x27;t apply carefully. That said its good for dirty hair days at the end of your color!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I am not very diligent about booking my hair appointments so I battle dark roots. A friend had given Rootflage to me to try and now I can&#x27;t live without it. It really helps stretch out my salon appointments. I love that it is inexpensive and portable. I keep one at home and one in my purse. I recommend to all blondes. If your hair is looking greasy it will also take care of that too!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Rootflage</li>
    <li> My career has me on the road for 6 to 7 months every year. I have a very short window to schedule in my hair appointments but I am not willing to give up my blonde highlights. Rootflage to the rescue! The packaging is small enough I can justify carrying it with me on the road and the results are spectacular. I like to mix the Warm Blonde, Cool Blonde, and Light Blonde to match my mix of highlights and it never let me down. This works better than any of the other products I have tried and is certainly a lot better than my past desperate self-highlights!</li>
    <li> I am surprised at how well this powder works to cover dark roots! I wish there were a less yellow version of the blonde range, but even so, it looks better than roots growing out before I can get to the hairdresser. It doesn&#x27;t seem to build up and feel unclean, either. It&#x27;s also very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and works better then anything out there for roots!  I am usually sensitive to most products, but not this one.  I cannot wait to share with friends and family.  I highly recommend to anyone that wants to wait longer in between salon visits!</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all!  The powder is bright yellow &amp; it really doesn&#x27;t blend your roots at all.  If you get it anywhere near your scalp, your scalp will be yellow.  Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> In theory this is an excellent idea - however the color is not &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; it is more like a mustard yellow - looks very fake</li>
    <li> I like it, but there was not really instructions on how to apply it correctly.  It has been a try and try again process.</li>
    <li> I got this from my sister for my birthday and it is amazing!! I was skeptical about how natural it would look, however it matched my hair perfectly! The helpful tip my sister gave me is to blend it in, just like foundation, blending is key to achieve a natural look! My budget is tight and I don&#x27;t normally spend money on things like this, but this is way cheaper than a trip to the salon! I will be buying my own rootflage from now on.</li>
    <li> Rootflage does exactly as promised... it temporarily hides my dark roots without looking chalky. The warm blonde lightens things just enough, and a side benefit is that it works as a dry shampoo, too. Haven&#x27;t seen anything like it before!</li>
    <li> I have medium brown hair that is bleached platinum. I tried the &amp;#34;cool blonde&amp;#34; shade and it was way too yellow. As far as consistency and coverage, it was fine. Just not the right shade. Not sure if &amp;#34;light blonde&amp;#34; would be a better choice for platinum gals?</li>
    <li> I have the cool blonde for summer and the warm blonde for winter and love them both! I love the warm blonde color in the winter because I can go so much longer in between touch ups with my stylist. Now I only color my hair once in the fall and one touch up in January. The rest of the time I&#x27;m able to touch up my roots seamlessly with rootflag. This product is wonderful and worth its weight in gold!</li>
    <li> I never, never write a product review. NEVER.  But, this product did EXACTLY what I hoped it would.  It really did cover up my 1 1/2 inch grow out from my highlights.  It takes very little product to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be a regular user!</li>
    <li> it will hide your dark roots, but it&#x27;s hard to figure out how much to use</li>
