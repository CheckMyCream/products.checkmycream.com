      <li>I just love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Use it for more then just my teeth.  </li>
      <li>SO MUCH BETTER THAN TOOTHPASTE</li>
      <li>Okay, so this wellness formula for our mouths and gums and teeth is so healing, cleansing and something I have been wishing for.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>Teeth feel very clean and are whiter to boot.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, you gotta do what&#x27;s best for you, and IMHO this is the product to long term oral  health.</li>
      <li>Makes your mouth feel truly clean!</li>
      <li>and it was a reasonable price for something that does good, or it supposed to.</li>
      <li>My Favorite Brushing Blend in the Whole Universe!!!</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S EASY TO USE WITH THE BRUSHES ORAWELLNESS RECOMMENDS.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t give you that really clean feeling like ORAMD which cost a lot more.</li>
      <li>THE BLEND COMPLIMENTS FLOSSING AND MY TEETH AND GUMS FEEL VERY CLEAN AND LOOK CLEAN AFTER EACH USE.  </li>
      <li>and I even get a free toothbrush now for being a loyal customer!</li>
      <li>Sometimes, I am not as attentive to keep it spic and span.</li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t taste fresh so you don&#x27;t have that nice mint fresh taste in your mouth</li>
      <li>I had such high hopes for this product, I looked everywhere for this product to find the best deal.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews here, generally I believe the Amazon community is truthful and honest, and this was the case.  </li>
      <li>I also use to clean gums.</li>
      <li>I have never had a cleaner feeling in my mouth after brushing, but this stuff literally gets your teeth squeaky clean</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, with some bentonite clay, and it seems to clean as well as any toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I do not like sweet things.</li>
      <li>Really, this stuff works better than any Listerine or product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I prefer really mint taste (not the case) or not mint at all to be able to use it while taking homeopathy.</li>
      <li>My teeth are super clean</li>
      <li>Overall a good product.</li>
      <li>My mouth feels fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 4 months pregnant and also have periodontal disease, of course I&#x27;m worried about the health of my unborn child</li>
      <li>Packaged well, arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>It tasted super clove-like, which is pungent if you&#x27;re not used to it, but I made friends with it because it helped me get rid of funk and bacteria that caused odors and soreness.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel really clean and definitely my gums love it!</li>
      <li>Great for the Bass Brushing Method.</li>
      <li>1 bottle lasts me about 6 weeks, but I&#x27;m very generous with it, you could easily get 2+ months out of each bottle.</li>
      <li>(I could see the through it in the very bottom of it), and could easily distinguish from the whiter/denser part of the teeth.</li>
      <li>We use OraWellness on a daily basis and love it!  </li>
      <li>Everyone Should try This Brushing Blend, I HIGHLY Recommend this for Everyone!!!</li>
      <li>but I think given the noticeable improvements I&#x27;ve already started to see, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>My mouth definitely feels more clean after I use it.  </li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ORAL HEALTH IN KEEPING YOUR TEETH &amp; GUMS CLEAN.  </li>
      <li>Pretty</li>
      <li>This is the second time I have purchased HealThy Mouth.  </li>
      <li>OraWellness is one of the many products I&#x27;ve tried as I convert my personal products to \\&quot;all</li>
      <li>The company is lovely to deal with and they always add a personal note</li>
      <li>My kids are okay with it too and my youngest actually prefers it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks OraWellness!</li>
      <li>The bristles are different and more spread apart</li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;m back for more.  </li>
      <li>Yess breath smells good and last long health fresh gums</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good deal to get these in a three pack - they last for a long time.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use too much toothpaste anymore.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do not like sweet things. I stopped brushing my teeth because all regular toothpaste made me nauseous with its sticky sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;This oil blend is AMAZING. I love how it tastes! My mouth feels great. Its the best for travel. It lasts for a long time. I just love this stuff. I brush my teeth sometimes 3 times a day now because its not a problem any more. YAY!</li>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase for me.  I bought the 3 piece kit with toothbrush and tongue scraper.  Now, I&#x27;m back for more.  Really, this stuff works better than any Listerine or product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I put a drop or two on top of my toothpaste and brush as usual.  At night, after brushing, I add about 5 drops of HealThyMouth to ~1/4 cup water and swish it around my mouth for a minute or so.  My oral health has never been better, and my gum/tooth sensitivity has vanished.  1 bottle lasts me about 6 weeks, but I&#x27;m very generous with it, you could easily get 2+ months out of each bottle.</li>
    <li> My mouth feels cleaner; Also my teeth look brighter.  It is very economical, as only three drops are required for cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> I love patronizing this family business.  I have already&lt;br /&gt;re ordered once (I keep giving it away to family:) )&lt;br /&gt;and will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;I add a couple of drops on my toothbrush along with&lt;br /&gt;a small amount of natural toothpaste.  I am expecting]]&lt;br /&gt;good reports at the dentist!</li>
    <li> Good tasting, not too strong, does not burn, heals most mouth ulcers. Recommend for those unable to use stronger OTC mouthwashes. Just wish it were less expensive!</li>
    <li> Love the taste (I even put one drop on my toddler&#x27;s toothbrush and he was ok with it). I use it in the morning to brush my teeth. In the evening I use tooth powder, and between the two of them the bad breath is gone. They are a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> Yess breath smells good and last long health fresh gums</li>
    <li> Was alright really no work for me ...üòï</li>
    <li> I have adult braces. It needs high maintenance care: floss, brush, mouthwash after each meal and before bed. Sometimes, I am not as attentive to keep it spic and span. This causes some bad funk and soreness between my gum and teeth. I did not have a good solution to help my gums feel better until I bought this after watching some lady do a youtube tutorial using HealThy Mouth Blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 3 pack and have been brushing thoroughly with 2 drops on my toothbrush without any toothpaste. Every 2 days before bed, if not everyday. It tasted super clove-like, which is pungent if you&#x27;re not used to it, but I made friends with it because it helped me get rid of funk and bacteria that caused odors and soreness. After I brush my teeth with it, I use a small pick brush to clean between each tooth in order to get the oils in every nook and cranny. Finally, rinse mouth with water, scrape my tongue to get the max benefits from 2 drops and it feels super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of diligence, I had no more bad breath and my soreness went away. When my orthodontist sees me, he compliments me on how clean and white my teeth look. I have noticed that plaque hates this stuff so it has a hard time growing on my teeth now. I feel so thankful that I no longer have to worry about gum soreness, plaque and putrid breath.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased HealThy Mouth.  I bought the three pack to give my mother and mother in law a bottle to try as well.  My mouth definitely feels more clean after I use it.  I like the refreshing feeling and the flavor is good.  I mostly taste the cinnamon.  My mother in law said she detected the clove more so.  My gums bleed less after using this for a couple months.  Also, I find that my teeth feel as though the plaque is gone after brushing with it.  My daily routine is using organic extra virgin coconut oil upon rising to oil pull for 20 minutes, followed by brushing with a sonicare toothbrush at this HealThy Mouth oil.  I then brush again with it before bed.  I will continue to purchase and use this.</li>
    <li> Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> I was doubtful. I read the ratings, I have heard various people talking about it. Enough positive press to give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 drops is all it takes. I brush like normal, not really needing to spit since it doesn&#x27;t foam like toothpaste. I add a bit of water at the end and swish the formula around my mouth like mouthwash. My teeth are super clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one deep pocket near a crown that bleeds and is decently sensitive. I also get a lot of food stuck around it so I am flossing 2-3 times per day. All the sensitivity and bleeding has stopped. It&#x27;s weird. I mean, this has been a problem for years and it will stop after just a couple days? Where has this stuff been? Pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the price stop you from trying for yourself. It will take a while to use this up at 2 drops a brushing...</li>
    <li> OraWellness is one of the many products I&#x27;ve tried as I convert my personal products to \\&quot;all natural.\\&quot; I love the taste of this product and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, with some bentonite clay, and it seems to clean as well as any toothpaste. The reason for 4 starts instead of 5 is because of price. It&#x27;s hard to pay this amount for a tiny bottle, but my hope is that it will last much longer than a tube of toothpaste. Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: after years of terrible dentist visits usually resulting in fillings, I had the best visit ever this week. I did not tell my dentist what I&#x27;ve been using, but she kept commenting on how good my teeth and gums looked. My cleaning was done in rapid time, with little pain and sensitivity.  I can&#x27;t say it was all OraWellness or the combination with the tooth powder. I do wish it was cheaper!</li>
    <li> 2 drops is what I use to brush my teeth with the Bass toothbrush. My wife uses 3.&lt;br /&gt;We use 2 drops when rinsing mouth out.&lt;br /&gt;I use 1 or 2 just for refreshing my breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s potent! It works and my wife&#x27;s gums have begun to regrow.</li>
    <li> The product seems to be working okay but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t give you that really clean feeling like ORAMD which cost a lot more.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this product, I looked everywhere for this product to find the best deal. I finally decided to go with amazon, because I had the account set up and it was a reasonable price for something that does good, or it supposed to. My issue is that after using this product my teeth started getting yellow and really thin (I could see the through it in the very bottom of it), and could easily distinguish from the whiter/denser part of the teeth. I was really sad, because I had such high hopes for the gengivities on my gums. Now I use it through the gums now and then until the bottles ends, but I don&#x27;t find it a necessity.</li>
    <li> Love it!* My teeth feel really clean and definitely my gums love it!** üëç great product. I recommend it to everyone!*</li>
    <li> Packaged well, arrived quickly. I put three drops on my brush before adding some of my favorite toothpaste (Earthpaste, Wintergreen flavor). My mouth feels fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Five stars for OraWellness HealThy Mouth Blend.  My mouth feels clean, like just left the dentist&#x27;s office on a daily basis.  The oils in this blend kill the bad germs, leaving a fresh and healthy mouth.  Never will return to traditional toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. A little pricey, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My mouth feels so good with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 4 months pregnant and also have periodontal disease, of course I&#x27;m worried about the health of my unborn child so I kept searching for something healthy and safe for the both of us and I think I found it! I have never had a cleaner feeling in my mouth after brushing, but this stuff literally gets your teeth squeaky clean and you have fresh breath for a really long time.</li>
    <li> Teeth feel very clean and are whiter to boot. Freshens breath as well.</li>
    <li> Use it for more then just my teeth.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff,  works well wouldnt be without it.  shipped fast was wrapped well</li>
    <li> We have bought this 3-pack twice now. It&#x27;s a fantastic alternative to nasty silica and fluoride filled commercial products. We&#x27;ve found our last teeth cleaning solution in OraWellness&#x27; product. Just had my 6 month checkup at the dentist and they commented how amazing my teeth were. However when I showed them what I&#x27;m using now, they were skeptical as it doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride... So don&#x27;t be surprised if you get a little push back from the dentist office. Nevertheless, you gotta do what&#x27;s best for you, and IMHO this is the product to long term oral  health. Thanks OraWellness!</li>
    <li> I have used conventional toothpaste all my life and then switched to fluoride free but with no relief from sensitive teeth, painful  and receding gums and tartar buildup. After researching on the internet about natural mouth care, I came upon OraWellness and have never looked back.  My teeth and gums have improved so much over the past year. My dental hygienist commented about how much better my teeth and gums looked and there was substantially much less tartar!  I love the toothbrushes they also recommend. The bristles are different and more spread apart and they can get between the teeth.  Check out their website for a whole new way of brushing your teeth. You&#x27;ll be amazed at the difference it makes.  The company is lovely to deal with and they always add a personal note and I even get a free toothbrush now for being a loyal customer! Spread the word about this amazing product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The Orawellness brushing blend listed here has greatly improved my teeth sensitivity.  I don&#x27;t like to run out of it because the sensitivity comes back when I&#x27;m not using it.  Ordering it in bulk like this is a good deal, too.</li>
    <li> Everyone Should try This Brushing Blend, I HIGHLY Recommend this for Everyone!!! My Favorite Brushing Blend in the Whole Universe!!! I&#x27;ve been using OraWellness Brushing Blend for almost a year and the results are Incredible!!! Every dentist I visit tells me i have no Plaque and my teeth Look Great and very Healthy!!!

    <li> We use OraWellness on a daily basis and love it!  We put one to two drops at each brushing.  Makes your mouth feel truly clean!</li>
    <li> I can tell after using Heal Thy Mouth for just a few months that my gums are much healthier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all my family will use.</li>
    <li> Great packaging, blend in glass bottle.  Organic oil blend to kill the bad bugs, and not kill the good bugs. I love the taste and aroma.  I use a drop to clean tongue, as mouthwash, tooth cleaner, and add a drop to floss to kill the bad bugs between teeth. I also use to clean gums. Oil is not diluted with water, so one drop goes a long way.  Wonderful, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> WOW..really great stuff!!  Stopped my aching tooth.  Recommenced by my natural Dr. and now I can get it for less in bulk!!&lt;br /&gt;Try it you&#x27;ll like it!!  I don&#x27;t use too much toothpaste anymore.</li>
    <li> fast shipping. well packed. this product is working real well for me. the excellent reviews i read before buying have shown to be true.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t love the taste of this!</li>
    <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ORAL HEALTH IN KEEPING YOUR TEETH &amp; GUMS CLEAN.  IT&#x27;S EASY TO USE WITH THE BRUSHES ORAWELLNESS RECOMMENDS. THE BLEND COMPLIMENTS FLOSSING AND MY TEETH AND GUMS FEEL VERY CLEAN AND LOOK CLEAN AFTER EACH USE.  SO MUCH BETTER THAN TOOTHPASTE BECAUSE IT&#x27;S MADE FROM NATURES INGREDIENTS AND NOT HARMFULL IF I SWALLOW THE OIL.</li>
    <li> Okay, so this wellness formula for our mouths and gums and teeth is so healing, cleansing and something I have been wishing for.&lt;br /&gt;My gum healed where it was hurting,my teeth look better than ever and my cleaning/checks are great. My tongue is happy (tongue scrapper) and flossing is good too. I look forward to taking care of my teeth. Bought this and the toothbrushes (I recommend) for everyone in my family and some friends. I am hooked and they are getting hooked too. Thank you Orawellness.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Keeps my breath fresher longer than regular toothpaste and if I use it at bedtime, the morning &#x27;dragon breath&#x27; is virtually gone.  Reason?  Well, they say it kills bacteria, so maybe that&#x27;s it.  No bleeding gums when I floss anymore either.  BIG plus there.  My kids are okay with it too and my youngest actually prefers it.  It was hard to get used to using only 2-3 drops when I normally like to load the brush with paste though.  Someday maybe they will come out with a paste? (Hint, hint! : )</li>
    <li> I read the reviews here, generally I believe the Amazon community is truthful and honest, and this was the case.  I have receding gums and after using this for even just a week I&#x27;ve noticed my gums between the teeth are plumper and healthier.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t see the receding gums on the actual gumline to be fixed (I know receding gums don&#x27;t grow back but I was hoping they would have the similar effect as the gum between the teeth). I don&#x27;t really notice the fresh breath that is reported by others, it&#x27;s a very slight hint but I doubt anyone talking to me could smell it.  My teeth aren&#x27;t noticeably whiter, but I hope with continued use it will brighten up like others have reported.  My teeth sensitivity appears to be less also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is steep but I think given the noticeable improvements I&#x27;ve already started to see, it&#x27;s worth it.  But I do wish the price can drop a bit.  around $50 for 3 bottles is harsh.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I am a bit dissapointed. I thought it didn&#x27;t have any mint oil at all. I prefer really mint taste (not the case) or not mint at all to be able to use it while taking homeopathy. This one doesn&#x27;t taste fresh so you don&#x27;t have that nice mint fresh taste in your mouth but it still has some mint so you can&#x27;t use it while taking homeopathy. A pity!</li>
    <li> Great for the Bass Brushing Method. SOO, glad that this formula is all organic. It&#x27;s a good deal to get these in a three pack - they last for a long time. A little expensive, esp., when compared to conventional toothpaste, but they&#x27;re a great value for the quality you get.</li>
