      <li>This scent is no longer easy to find anywhere</li>
      <li>Nice strong scent because I really stink, and I need something to mask the smell</li>
      <li>Smells great, keeps me from smelling, and last all day!</li>
      <li>Old Spice always has been good product.</li>
      <li>and I like it, very fresh scent and reminds me of the beach.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed using Old Spice products for many years now.</li>
      <li>strong scent powerful one</li>
      <li>so if you arent a big risk taker this is a good bet.  </li>
      <li>Deodorant has fresh smell and works well.</li>
      <li>Provides good protection through the day but rubbed off a layer of skin as an active prrson.</li>
      <li>but this deodorant has not failed me so far even in the most strenuous of activities.  </li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>Description fits the product exactly.</li>
      <li>AF is no longer able at local retail stores</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s how much I love the smell of this red spice product plus it blends with my cologne.</li>
      <li>Deodorant comes in pack of 3, and 1 more outside of the package.</li>
      <li>This is a Deodorant and not an Antiperspirant, but it really smells great and is long lasting.</li>
      <li>The four sticks he bought have lasted more than 6 months now, so this stuff lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good deo, as usual</li>
      <li>It holds up better than expected.</li>
      <li>Really lives up to the 24 hr brag.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>My husband found the Arctic Force scent in a more remote town and now we can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
      <li>Thanks..</li>
      <li>It has a nice fragrant that is not overly strong like other brands, including other Old Spice brands.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more convenient than heading down to the store once every couple months intending to buy deodorant and returning with a tube of Pringle&#x27;s and 6-pack instead.</li>
      <li>It is pretty similar to pure sport</li>
      <li>Leaves me smelling clean and fresh all day long, without making my underarms feel sticky or gross.  </li>
      <li>I like the scent as well because it&#x27;s got some of that Old Spice smell without being overpowering or overbearing and smells much cleaner than others.</li>
      <li>New smell for me</li>
      <li>the ladies will appreciate it when they get close enough ;)</li>
      <li>I got this &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; after hearing it was discontinued and very disappointed that this great version won&#x27;t be sold any more.</li>
      <li>Similar to pure sport.  </li>
      <li>Arrived in same package as another item, packed very well..</li>
      <li>so I purchased before Old Spice discontinues.</li>
      <li>My husband likes the old spice&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
      <li>Smells great and consistently keeps me smelling great (or at the very worst, not smelling bad) even after intense gym sessions.</li>
      <li>Also, and this was key when I switched to Old Spice Deodorants, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing.</li>
      <li>Old Spice has been my go-to since I was a teen, and they have done well with this product.</li>
      <li>I usually order in bulk and I am good for at least a year.  </li>
      <li>Old Spice High Endurance Arctic Force Scent Men&#x27;s Deodorant is a somewhat similar scent like the long lasting Old Spice traditional scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to antiperspirants, presumably due to the aluminum content in them, so I&#x27;ve always been very picky about the underarm products I use.</li>
      <li>If you sweat a lot and smell bad fairly often like I do, this is the way to go.</li>

    <li> Great deodorant.  Leaves me smelling clean and fresh all day long, without making my underarms feel sticky or gross.  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> This scent is no longer easy to find anywhere and it&#x27;s the only one my boyfriend will wear. I hope Amazon continues to carry this, because I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;ll do if he can&#x27;t find &amp;#34;his&amp;#34; deodorant anymore. I like the scent as well because it&#x27;s got some of that Old Spice smell without being overpowering or overbearing and smells much cleaner than others.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this one. he likes it and the price is good.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using Old Spice products for many years now. This deodorant lasts all day and then some. The scent is great and a lot of people around me(mostly women) have taken notice of it and have told me that I smell really good. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Provides good protection through the day but rubbed off a layer of skin as an active prrson. The deodorant creates a grip then rubs anywhere jt touches. I&#x27;m definately returning....</li>
    <li> Deodorant has fresh smell and works well. Fragrance is not as likeable as discontinued Mountain Rush. AF is no longer able at local retail stores so I purchased before Old Spice discontinues.</li>
    <li> strong scent powerful one</li>
    <li> Same quality product as always.</li>
    <li> Great products and quick shipping</li>
    <li> Awesome.  I now smell like a Norse god.</li>
    <li> Smells great and consistently keeps me smelling great (or at the very worst, not smelling bad) even after intense gym sessions. Also, and this was key when I switched to Old Spice Deodorants, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing.

    <li> Old Spice is the best, nothing more to say!!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, great save for buying in bulk!</li>
    <li> I love this brand of deodorant!  I usually order in bulk and I am good for at least a year.  This deodorant is my favorite.  I ran into it about 2 years ago and since then I have not run into any other type that could replace it.  It has a nice fragrant that is not overly strong like other brands, including other Old Spice brands.  I am a sweaty guy but this deodorant has not failed me so far even in the most strenuous of activities.  I love it and I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really smells good. My husband found the Arctic Force scent in a more remote town and now we can&#x27;t find it anywhere. The four sticks he bought have lasted more than 6 months now, so this stuff lasts a long time. I love it when he wears this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No rashes or burns for him. Even when he&#x27;s sweaty, this stuff seams to just smell better.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the old spice&lt;br /&gt;High Endurance, it has been hard to&lt;br /&gt;find most of the time. So we shopped&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com and there it was . Thanks..</li>
    <li> Wish you could still get this stuff in stores but getting here is just as good.  Plus I think it ended up being cheaper</li>
    <li> Love it! Arrived in same package as another item, packed very well.. Deodorant came plastic-wrapped, works great, and with the four pack, I can keep a steady supply at both home and work!! I&#x27;ll probablyorder again..</li>
    <li> Similar to pure sport.  Its hard buying a new flavor of deod online.. The artic force is a very good scent. It is pretty similar to pure sport so if you arent a big risk taker this is a good bet.  Its not obnoxious and the ladies will appreciate it when they get close enough ;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good deo, as usual</li>
    <li> Awesome deal!!! Great smell! Can&#x27;t get this price in any store! New smell for me and I like it, very fresh scent and reminds me of the beach.</li>
    <li> Great odor control. Really lives up to the 24 hr brag.</li>
    <li> Old Spice High Endurance Arctic Force Scent Men&#x27;s Deodorant is a somewhat similar scent like the long lasting Old Spice traditional scent. The High Endurance Arctic Force Scent smells great and holds up quite well.  It leaves me feeling clean and refreshed! This is a Deodorant and not an Antiperspirant, but it really smells great and is long lasting.</li>
    <li> Old Spice always has been good product. Works great.</li>
    <li> Great deal, love the smell. Discontinued in stores here so glad we found it!</li>
    <li> Went to 3 walmarts trying to find this specific deodorant and had absolutely no luck. That&#x27;s how much I love the smell of this red spice product plus it blends with my cologne. Better then sport and definitely better then original. The only other old spice deodorant that can compete with this is swagger. Granted I&#x27;m of the younger age. It would be kinda awkward if my 76 year old grandfather smelled like a high school kid haha. Great product and great smell! Definitely recommend plus this bundle will last me a life time.</li>
    <li> The best scent from Old Spice. I wish I could find it in stores.</li>
    <li> If you sweat a lot and smell bad fairly often like I do, this is the way to go. The Arctic Force &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is superb. It smells good but isn&#x27;t overpowering. If someone is close, and I mean close, they can maybe smell it. But it protects you all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you workout, it won&#x27;t protect you from being stinky, but that&#x27;s working out (if you sweat like I do)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the pack of 4. It&#x27;s more convenient than heading down to the store once every couple months intending to buy deodorant and returning with a tube of Pringle&#x27;s and 6-pack instead.</li>
    <li> Smells great, keeps me from smelling, and last all day! All around good!</li>
    <li> One of the best deodorants I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m allergic to antiperspirants, presumably due to the aluminum content in them, so I&#x27;ve always been very picky about the underarm products I use. Old Spice has been my go-to since I was a teen, and they have done well with this product. I will admit that after a long, active day using Old Spice&#x27;s other products from this line, I typically wound up with a somewhat undesirable scent by the end of the night, unless re-applied. With this Arctic Force scent, I no longer have that issue. It holds up better than expected.</li>
    <li> Nice strong scent because I really stink, and I need something to mask the smell so I can get a date for the weekend.</li>
    <li> Description fits the product exactly. Deodorant comes in pack of 3, and 1 more outside of the package. Smells delicious.</li>
