      <li>It is a real pick-me-up.</li>
      <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>it is very noticable.</li>
      <li>Now girlfriend is jealous and wants one too.</li>
      <li>I pair this with a dark red lip liner and they compliment each other wonderfully.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more expensive than the original I get from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I put a thin layer of foundation on my lips before applying the lipstick for a more consistant and vivid shade, but it isn&#x27;t a must.</li>
      <li>I wear it when I go out (or want a statement lip) and keep my eye makeup very simple, usually a VERY soft brown smokey eye.</li>
      <li>I never wear lipstick, so this was a little drastic at first</li>

<li> This lipstick is nothing like the original even the packaging is fake.</li>
<li> Instead of being dry on the lip, it&#x27;s oily n messy.</li>
<li> Try it if you like very dark.</li>
<li> This is very dark and vampy-like.  </li>
<li> Another plus is that it you can go a few hours without having to do a touch up.</li>
<li> Little dark, but don&#x27;t put it on too thick per the Mrs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> To make it worst</li>

    <li> The daughter love it !</li>
    <li> I ordered this lipstick in the shade diva and I love it. It was a bit darker than I was expecting but it looks wonderful. It is not as drying as I originally thought it would be, although, chapstick will be your best friend. If you have any sort of chapped lips it is very noticable. Sometimes I put a thin layer of foundation on my lips before applying the lipstick for a more consistant and vivid shade, but it isn&#x27;t a must. Another plus is that it you can go a few hours without having to do a touch up. I pair this with a dark red lip liner and they compliment each other wonderfully. I love the look and I am extremely happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Little dark, but don&#x27;t put it on too thick per the Mrs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks awesome .</li>

    <li> Love the color! Great matte finish.</li>
    <li> I thought the color diva was more purple and darker. I think it&#x27;s a knock off so I&#x27;m better off buying the real thing.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is nothing like the original even the packaging is fake. Instead of being dry on the lip, it&#x27;s oily n messy. To make it worst it&#x27;s more expensive than the original I get from Macy&#x27;s. Very disappointed. This is not the Original MAC DIVA lipstick.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is fabulous!! It looks great no matter your complexion, hair color, etc. I never wear lipstick, so this was a little drastic at first, it is now my daily wear color.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this lipstick at every MAC store that I go to, and everywhere, they are sold out of Diva.  It is long-lasting, and the color is rich.  Do yourself a favor and try this lipstick. It is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> love my lipstick! Beautiful color!!!</li>
    <li> Really really beautiful color ,long lasting ,and will def purchase this color again it&#x27;s elegant great for a night out</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift to someone and she absolutely loves it. Now girlfriend is jealous and wants one too.</li>
    <li> Red Russian is the best of the reds.  This is very dark and vampy-like.  For Goths maybe.  Try it if you like very dark.</li>
    <li> Love the rich color and the matte look of this lipstick. Mac products are excellent. great product and would buy again</li>
    <li> I love this color.  It is so 90s and so in right now.  I am not super super pale, but I am more medium fair toned and this color worked perfectly on me.</li>
    <li> VERY FAST SHIPPING! :) I ordered this lipstick on February 20. 2014 and now it&#x27;s my possession on February 24. 2014. The lipstick itself was new and placed in a nice shipment container for safety. The quality is fabulous (as most MAC products are) the color looks great and compliments my olive skin tone nicely. I wear it when I go out (or want a statement lip) and keep my eye makeup very simple, usually a VERY soft brown smokey eye. Overall I love this color and would MOST definitely buy from this seller again! VERY PLEASED!</li>
