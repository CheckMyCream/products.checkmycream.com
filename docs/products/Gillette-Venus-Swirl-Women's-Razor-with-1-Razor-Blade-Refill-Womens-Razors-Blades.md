<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was not impressed like I thought I would be about the product.  Refills are expensive . Will stick with the Venus embrace.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor at Walmart. It was a little over $12. It was an impulse buy because of their little display that showed the razor gliding over bumps with ease. You can also watch the video on their website. I was thinking the razor would move on the ball in all directions but really it only goes side to side. So unless you shave in a zig zag pattern I really can&#x27;t see how this would help. The razor never moves on the ball when I use it. The blade, when you press down firmly (to get a close shave) flips down (meaning it is laying flat instead of at an angle like most razors) this seems to make it much harder to get a close shave. It seems like I have to press extremely hard to get a good smooth shave, but then I&#x27;m cutting myself all over. (Not just knees and ankles, just randomly causing Knicks!) it&#x27;s really hard to get a good shave with this razor. I pretty much hate it. I thought I&#x27;d take the time to review this so no one else falls for the neat little demo! You can however get a refund (2x your purchase price) but you have to send in recept, UPC and razor. I threw the package away last week so that&#x27;s out for me. :/</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail today from the company. I used it with the Violet Swirl shave gel. Using both made my shaving expericence very smooth and effortless. Only thing I can say that&#x27;s annoying about it is, if you go fast like up your leg the ball will make it turn and you lose control over it. I recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I have been using men&#x27;s razors for the last 10 years or so because I was fed up with the sub-par shave that girly razors were giving me. But I&#x27;m happily sold on this razor now. It gave me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time. I didn&#x27;t have to press down at all and it cut through my neglected leg hair easily. My favorite feature is the ball joint because it glided over my awful knees without nicking them, something that has been pretty much unachievable since I started shaving. I&#x27;m usually a lazy shaver (I&#x27;ve been known to give up after 1 leg), but today I shaved EVERYTHING. I rush my baths during my toddler&#x27;s nap time so I can get everything else on my list done and I am always happy with something that makes that easier to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This razor was provided to me free by Venus, but the review is all mine</li>
    <li> I got to try this razor free courtesy of Gillette.  I had much higher expectations for this razor because of the hype and all these 5 star reviews; however, it was just another razor with a gimmick.  I thought the flex ball would provide a smoother shave and transition in different directions.  It did not and only moved side-to-side, which is great if you shave in a zigzag pattern rather than up your leg.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t shave this way.  I did like the moisture strips.  Overall, it seemed like any other razors - nothing special to make me purchase it again.  I&#x27;ve had better, closer shaves from other razors, but this is fine for occasional use.</li>
    <li> Love the Venus flex ball razor it was an awesome shave nice and smooth it just slide along my leg and didn&#x27;t have to go over again thanks for the razor</li>
    <li> So I got this shaver via bzzz agent for free.... Tried it out and got amazing results. Firstly, this shaver has 5 BLADES !!!! ding ding already a winner !! Secondly, I was able to shave the hard to reach places like the knee area,behind the calve area and right above the ankle ... I was amazed since I got NO CUTS!! FINALLY... IT&#x27;S RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> hands down the best razor I will ever use! I tried this product free thanks to Venus &amp; I am so glad that I have! You should try it! It will be the best shave and you won&#x27;t be able to stop using it!</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free from bzz agent and I love it. It gives a nice clean shave and leaves your legs smooth</li>
    <li> I tried this razor as part of a promotion from Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I really didn&#x27;t care for the design. The actual blade part of the razor swivels on the base, and I found that it swiveled way too much- it was hard for me to shave with it, because it wouldn&#x27;t stay close to the skin. To actually shave, I had to apply way more pressure than I like to, because when I do that, I usually end up cutting myself. Overall, I would not buy this product. I think the swivel design is a cool idea, but very poorly executed.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for my chance to try out the Venus Swirl. I was more than willing to give the razor a try. The design drew me in right away...a razor that had flexiability...I couldn&#x27;t wait!&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to the test... The flex that I couldn&#x27;t wait to try ended up biting me in the end. On the first glide on my leg I ended up with a pretty deep cut. The contour razors and the flex did not like the movement around my knee. A second little nip of my skin and I gave in. Thanks to Venus for the opportunity.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I got this sample complimentary of Bzzagent.com and was blown away!!!  The razor glided across my skin so smoothly and closely. I was left with a great shave which rendered wonderful results. There was no irritation or razor burn.Its a soft shave with those little moisturizing pads that are on the razor. I will recommend as well as continue to use this product!1</li>
    <li> I like this razor it is easy to use. i like that the blade moves to make it easy to get the back of my legs.i like that the blade has 5 blades that makes the shave close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor: I did not find any use for the flexi ball i think its useless it moves at a very small rotation left and right. under the flexi ball water gets into it so i hope that doesn&#x27;t cause problems later down the road. the handle is pretty and has grips so it will be easier to use. it has a pretty design too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade: the blades are interchangeable it has a part on the razor that you slide up and it pops off. the blade has moisture stripes all around the blade which i like. i also like that it has a grip under the blades so it will not be easy to mistake and cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*i received this from Venus/Gillette company for review*</li>
    <li> As expected, 5 blades, close shave with moisturizing strip. Really like the pretty swirl pattern on the handle.</li>
    <li> Gillette has released their new Venus Swirl line,which I received for my honest review through a promotional opportunity. The Venus Swirl razor has the new flexiball technology which allows the razor blade to pivot left and right while the blade also moves to flatten against your skin like most non-disposable razors. It has five contour blades that are flexible and thin so they get an extra close shave. The combination allows for the razor to move across the contours of your body smoothly and without cutting your skin. I found this combination very accurate. I was able to quickly shave my legs without having to worry about the direction I was moving the razor. No awkward positions trying to reach difficult places. I shaved my legs, armpits, and bikini line with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t cut myself at all and that is partly due to the water activated moisture ring around the blade to help the razor glide on the skin. You might think that it would prevent the blades from getting a really close shave or would cause it to miss hairs, but it is designed specifically not to do that. After one swipe with the razor, I noticed that nearly all the hairs on my leg had indeed been cut and very close to the skin. The pictures below show first what my leg looked like prior to shaving and how close of a shave I got with a single pass over of the razor. You can see that my legs weren&#x27;t super hairy, but there is a difference in the pictures.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor!! I got it free from #Venus along with the Violet Swirl Shave Gel. They work well together and the razor is amazing. The shave was effortless and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was hacking away at my legs. It&#x27;s the next day and I don&#x27;t have the usual stubble I get with other razors. This is a great razor for anyone who wants a fast and effective shave that lasts a bit longer than other shaves. The pivoting head also lets me get all the hairs on my knee on the first try. Big plus!!</li>
    <li> I got this Venus Swirl Razor a couple days ago as a promotion from Gillette and just tried it on my arms and I LOVE IT!!!!!  It is the best razor I&#x27;ve used in a very long time.  I normally use Veet or a cheap disposable razor and you can feel it pulling the hairs on your skin.  This was so not that, it literally slid across my skin so effortlessly and quickly.  I really didn&#x27;t think it was shaving anything because it was just moving so smoothly.  I advise everyone try this razor!!</li>
    <li> The handle and color of this razor is very pretty. The grip makes it very easy to hold while in the shower. This handle is unlike other Venus razors that I have used before, such as Venus Spa and Venus Tropical, which will slip out of my hand while in the shower [although I love the scent of those razors]. The flexiball allows me to have control over the razor for a cleaner shave. #Sponsored    FTC: I was sent this razor for review through Venus. All reviews are written with 100% honesty from my own perspective.</li>
    <li> I had received this razor from Venus as a product to try out.  I had first seen this flexiball on a men&#x27;s razor while shopping a while ago and wondered what made a man&#x27;s face more important than a woman&#x27;s many areas we shave that they needed this technology and we didn&#x27;t.  Needless to say, I was quite happy to see Gillette stepping up and not forgetting about us.  The box came with the razor itself and one disposable cartridge.  I will say, trying to get the cartridge out of the package was a little hard as the blade is surrounded by a soothing serum that is quite large.  Once I was able to try it out, I was no longer cussing out the cumbersome soothing serum as it felt as if it was helping the razor glide along my leg.  With the flexiball, I was able to get around my ankles and knees without making a mess like the Psycho shower scene.  The handle is easy to grip and didn&#x27;t get slippery when wet, popping out of my hands.  The only problem I have with this package is that it didn&#x27;t have a holder to place it in, which would be nice because laying it down in the shower caused the serum to dry onto the shelf which pulled off when going to use it the following shower.</li>
    <li> I (Sara) Got to try this product for free! Thanks Venus! I have been a loyal venus user for almost a decade, this product has just reminded me why. I only had to make one pass over the areas I was shaving to be done. The ball technology allows the razor to move with the contours of your body. No more nicked knees!! I recommend trying this new one out.</li>
    <li> Love this razor, it glides over your skin so smoothly that it doesn&#x27;t even feel as though you are shaving, but you are. Really enjoyed the Flexi Ball feature that comes in handy in areas such as your knees and around ankles. It glides over so smoothly you don&#x27;t have to slow down with your shaving. It made the process much faster. I really enjoy this product and recommend anyone to purchase. I am glad Gillette Venus sent this to me for free to try :)</li>
    <li> I received this Venus Swirl free from Venus to try.  I really love the way it shaves.  The flexball lets is shave around the knees without any cuts.  It left my legs really smooth.  This is a very good razor to own. When I shaved my legs I used the Venus Swirl with a touch of Olay shaving cream and it left my legs so soft and smooth. Thanks Venus for such a great  product. I have tried the Venus Swirl with flexball several times now.  It gives me such a wonderful shave everytime.  Easy to get around my knees without any nicks.  I really love this razor.  Every woman should try it.  It is absolutely great.  I  got mine free from Venus.  You won&#x27;t regret buying it.  I promise</li>
    <li> I was able to try this razor as a gift from Gillette and BzzAgent. My favorite part of the razor is the water activated MoistureGlide Serum that surrounds the blades. Personally, I shave my legs in the shower after I&#x27;ve bathed. I always think this will make my legs more soft so that the hairs release easier. Anyways, when activated with water, the moisture glide helps you to shave your legs effortlessly. You don&#x27;t really need any shave gel with this razor, for this reason. I just love it! It made my legs feel so smooth and luxuriously silky.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus Swirl Razor as part of a promotion from the Venus.  The razor is AMAZING!  It gives a close shave with out the nicks!&lt;br /&gt;It glides across my legs so easy and smoothly.  My new favorite:)</li>
    <li> This razor, given to me by Venus is wonderful!  I was intrigued by the sleek design and comfort grip and the blades were like no other razor I had used before.  When I used it, I could not even feel the blades on my skin- I really did not think it was even working- until I felt my leg!  Wow!  Smooth as possible!  No hair and no feeling of blades on the skin- great product and I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Venus, to test.  I have very sensitive skin and tend to get razor burn fairly easily.  I used this razor and ended up with my usual razor burn, but also had little nicks everywhere.  I had spots of blood all over my legs.  My skin also itched a lot, even after I put lotion on.  This razor is okay, but nothing fantastic.  For the price it is, I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided as a free trial by Gillette and BzzAgent for reviewing purposes, but let me tell you, this is a quality razor. Shaving this morning, I didn&#x27;t even nick myself around my ankles or knees, and the handle provides great grip and control. However, the shave isn&#x27;t as close as I would like it (maybe because I didn&#x27;t use shaving cream), and also the blades don&#x27;t have that nice tool that helps to clean the hair out --you know, the thing that you can press down to slide in between them, that &amp;#34;ejects&amp;#34; the gunked up hair and nastiness that accumulates and clogs the blades. Regardless, this razor is fantastic, I only wish refills weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette for sending me this amazing tool to test out! I can already tell im soo loving this and that it will be my go to! It has these 5 blades that make sure to get every single hair follicle and the unique flexibal makes the process much more easier. I have very dry sensitive skin and the moisture glides leave my skin extra soft and moisturized just as it should. Since its my first time using it i will be seeing how long it will last with ots greatness! Thank you Gillette!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several types of razors over the years. As a mom anything that can reduce my shave time is a plus. I was very excited when I got this product sponsored through bzzagent to try.&lt;br /&gt;This venus swirl razor definitely helps cut down time with its ease &amp; maneuverability.&lt;br /&gt;It moves easily and quickly over the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Add the venus swirl shave gel and you&#x27;re set!&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good razor with its sleek design and the surface area around the blades.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This razor offers a totally unique movement, moving in multiple directions to get a closer than ever shave in all of the tricky areas of your legs&lt;br /&gt;The blades are smooth and sharp and I experienced zero nicks and cuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades glide so smoothly in water- you hardly need shave gel. My legs and underarms have never felt better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs felt moisturized, hair free and the whole experience of shaving was quicker than ever before!</li>
    <li> Gave a really close shave and made my legs feel smooth</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Venus for free to review. THIS IS THE BEST RAZOR I HAVE EVER USED! Ive always used disposable razors. But i will NEVER use any other razor than this one. Its been the closest shave I have ever gotten. It leaves my body feeling better than it has ever felt and beyond smooth!! Try it and you will be satisfied.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Venus to test how it works. I admit, it looks super pretty with its dark purple handle and silver ball, which is supposed to be the &amp;#34;swirl&amp;#34; part of the razor. I have to admit, even though the razor advertises itself as being able to move to contour to my body, I did not notice any noticeable difference in the movement of the razor head. Another thing I am slightly disappointed in is the cap for the blade; it may just be something I&#x27;m personally picky about, but the cap is super bulky and it causes the outer layer of &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; to get gloopy inside of the cap because it is slightly wet after I put it back into the cap. Other than these problems, I think that this razor does a really good job with getting my hairs and is much better than my previous razor that I had been using.</li>
    <li> My wife received this fancy razor from Venus to try for free.  She already uses a Venus brand (disposable) razor and wasn&#x27;t sure the experience would get much better, but she was pleasantly surprised by the movement and close shave of this razor.  The gentle movement and swivel follows your body&#x27;s natural contour to get a nice close shave every time, everywhere.</li>
    <li> I received the new Venus Swirl Shaver from The brand to try it out.  I found that the swirl ball made shaving my legs so much easier! The effortless shave also saved time.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor free in the mail to test as a promotion from Gilette Venus. This razor is not all that it&#x27;s hyped up to be. In my opinion it&#x27;s much like a regular, run of the mill razor. I still get razor burn, and I still miss tiny patches of hair. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this product to anyone who wants to make shaving less of a chore.</li>
    <li> *I recieved this product for free from Gillette. However, that did not sway my opinion in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gave my a very smooth underarm shave and two days later I have no signs of hair regrowth. For the first time in my life I could not feel the razor biting my skin and wasn&#x27;t even sure that hair was being removed because it was so smooth. However, all the hair is gone leaving smooth skin. I understand this product is on the expensive side but I do think it is worth it. My only negative comment is that the blade can be inserted onto the handle in the wrong position. It would have been nice if there was only one way to insert the blade so that there is no confusion.</li>
    <li> I was given this item for free from bzzagent. Although i did not think it lived up to the hype as far as a better shave but the razor stick is amazing! It is a great concept the razor contours to your skin and glides across. It makes shaving your knees, behind yours knees and close to your ankles so effortless. The handle has a nice grip to it and it fits perfectly into your hand and fingers. With the flexiball, it&#x27;s able to shift and bend so you get a nice smooth, close shave, so for that i love it!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a sample product from Venus. It is light weight and slim compared to the other moisture infused razors. The FlexiBall makes shaving around the ankles and knees a breeze with no little hairs left behind. I highly recommend this razor to the young and the old.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used the Venus brand for shaving and was satisfied at the quality, so when this one came along i know it&#x27;s worth trying. The new handle features the ball made famous by the men&#x27;s line of Gilette razors. Im guessing their ladies have been stealing and using it from their men and well we all want our own. It easily glides on curves and that dreaded knee. The reusable handle and interchangeable razor heads is still a plus.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! I&#x27;m attached to the Venus brand anyway, but this razor glides and shaves beautifully! The &amp;#34;swirl&amp;#34; feature allows for the razor to easily shave closely on curves. I love how easy it is to use on knees and the back of my legs!</li>
    <li> This is an easy to use, bodily versatile, refreshing product!</li>
    <li> I received this product as a promotion from Venus, and I found it to be an average product. I also didn&#x27;t find the Flexiball to serve any real function. While the razor was great for shaving larger areas, like my legs, the bulky size of the razors head made it impossible to shave the bikini area. The wear and tear on the aloe strip was pretty minimal though, and that was a small bonus, especially if you had to do a rush &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shave.</li>
    <li> I received the Venus swirl from Gillette to try (via BzzAgent) and I am so glad I did! Thanks Gillette for this improved design, the handle is comfy to hold and the flexball allows the five blades to glide over problem spots. I would always seem to miss a few spots, not noticing until I was dressed lol not so with this razor. Silky smooth legs will BE MINE this summer!</li>
    <li> I recieveed this from the bzz agent campaign. So I have sensitive skin and got this hoping it would be able to get the job done without any nicks or cuts.When I first use a razor it tends to be just too sharp and this was about the same. I have to use a sensitive shave gel and the first use still left some cuts. But I will say that the grip is nice and it does have a little extra with the flexiball, but the ball only allows it to swivel in two directions. So as I shave it really did not make that big of a difference. I think it is a new advancement but it can get better just needs more work! It still is a nice razor though, just my sensitive skin makes me picky! #sponsored</li>
    <li> I received the Venus Swirl razor as a promotion from the brand and was excited to try it out immediately. It is very important  to me to get the closest, smoothest shave possible on my legs or what is the point?! My normal routine consists of shaving my legs in several different directions, now with this shaving session I was able to make one continuous stroke from ankle to thigh and right on over the knee without any cuts and not even needing any shaving gel. My legs are super smooth and it took less time than my normal razor. One happy gal.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing I received free from Venus and buzz agent along with the The venus violet swirl with the touch of olay shave gel to review and give my option and experience but in no way was I influenced, this is my own review and experience with the Gillette Venus swirl razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is amazing and awesome the packing is cute and very easy to open ,it comes with one cartilage and it has the ultimate movement for a perfect close shave even in the rough spots such as your Knees and ankles. I am a woman but I&#x27;ve never been into using woman&#x27;s razors in my opinion mens razors always provided the closest smoothest shave for me without cuts and now that I&#x27;ve gotten to try this razor, I am in love and never going back to men&#x27;s razors it has everything I look for in a razor. It has five blades and a water activated serum around the whole razor head for and smooth moisturizing shave with out getting all slimy. My legs were so smooth and soft like silk when I was done. The handle has a beautiful design it has some rubber so it&#x27;s easy to grip, the flexi ball provides the best movement you can ask for in a razor. To top it off it&#x27;s my favorite color purple I definitely recommend this razor to all my gal friends and family.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this razor free thanks to Venus, but I would have bought this without getting it free because I am always on the hunt for the best razor. I loved this razor, it glided smoothly over my skin and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with hair left behind on nicks. I don&#x27;t think it is so much the ball it is on, which only moves a small amount, but has everything to do with the water-activated MoistureGlide serum. The MoistureGlide serum was really what made this razor for me!</li>
    <li> It is really hard to find a razor that I can use regularly and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin (and that ACTUALLY shaves!) The Venus Swirl Razor that I received free courtesy of Venus actually does both! The flex ball lets me get close without cutting around the back of my knees and ankles. Plus, the moisturizing strip on it makes my leg so slick and soft while I shave, I wouldn&#x27;t bee too worried if I ran out of shaving cream, I&#x27;d be just fine without it in a pinch. I normally will just use a disposable razor because I don&#x27;t like to re-use the same one more than just one or two times because it will break my skin out from the blades getting dull.  I&#x27;ve already used my Venus Swirl Razor more than that!  This may be the game changer. The one that I actually keep and just buy the replacement heads. They&#x27;ve made a great one this time, I love it and you will too.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of brand promotion, but that shouldn&#x27;t matter because I&#x27;ve always been a committed customer to Gillette Venus!    As always, Venus has created a razor that further meets the needs of women! All women know the struggle of hair removal and shaving, and Venus makes it that much easier to remove hair without the scariness of razor burns. Honestly, the Flexiball definitely helps in reaching the contours of my body! The 5 blades make the shave that much more smoother. For the long term and overall value that you get, definitely get the Venus Swirl Razor. I&#x27;ve used Venus ever since I was in middle school (I&#x27;m now almost 23) and they&#x27;ve never let me down!</li>
    <li> I received the razor free as part of a promotion from the brand. It is easily my favorite new razor. The flexiball technology makes shaving so much easier, and so much safer. Normally I at least have some nicks from my razor, especially around my knees, but with this razor it&#x27;s simply not the case. The handle is perfect, it fits in my hand perfectly. It&#x27;s not awkward to hold, and it is durable. It left my legs feeling super smooth and silky, definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I loved this razor that I received free as a part of a promotion on behalf of Gilette. I was utterly amazed at the closeness of the shave.  I typically have patches I have missed and forgo shaving knees and ankles do to nicking myself.  These problems have been resolved with the venus swirl.  What an inovative idea!  Finally a close/smooth shave.  I will never go back to a my old disposible razors.</li>
    <li> See the review of the razor refills..</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a promotion, and am so thankful that I did. Admittedly, I&#x27;m a bit of a lazy shaver in that I usually wait as long as possible between shaves...but this razor (and the Violet Swirl Shave Gel) may make me rethink that plan. The razor allowed me to move easily over bumps and curves and I got a close shave that left my legs feeling nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to BzzAgent. I usually use men&#x27;s razors because they usually give a closer shave than women&#x27;s razors. This razor changes that. I can get a really close shave with this razor. My legs have never been as smooth as they are now.The five blades give a closer shave than I have ever had with women&#x27;s razors. It is also great for hard to shave places like your ankles or knees.Shaving is so effortless with this razor. The handle is comfortable to hold, and  is also aesthetically pleasing. This razor is fantastic. I would recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Good quality razor. Love how it contours so you don&#x27;t cut yourself with the harder to shave places on your legs.</li>
    <li> First i wanna say that i am trying this product FREE thanks to Gillette!! I absolutely love this razor! it contours to your skin and leaves you with silky smooth skin. it easily glides on your skin, for the best shaving experience! no cuts, razor burn or stubble!!</li>
    <li> I love this razor! The flexible design allows for the closet shave I&#x27;ve ever had and I love the pretty color!</li>
    <li> I was able to try out this razor as a part of a BzzAgent campaign.  I have used Gillette razors in the past, but the Venus Swirl Razor is far superior.  The design has a ball that helps contour against your skin, but I really only find that element helpful when using it to shave around my knees. My knees have frequently been knicked when using razors in the past, but the contouring prevents that from happening. The handle is lightweight and easy to use. The five razor blades is my favorite feature on this razor.  It allow for a close, smooth shave.  I found that once the waterglide moisture is activated on the razor there is no need to use shaving cream.  Using this razor makes shaving your legs a breeze.  It works well against your skin and leaves the surface smooth and clean.  I think that the five blade technology is the key to making this razor great.  I have used the razor multiple times now and the only observation I can say is that the hair on my legs is not growing back as fast did with other razors.  Also, the time it takes to shave is less using this razor.  I no longer need to go over an area multiple times to get it to work.  It&#x27;s an easy to use, effective razor.</li>
    <li> Ive always used disposable razors. But i will NEVER use any other razor than this one. Its been the closest shave I have ever gotten. Try these and you wont be unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> I was able to try out the new Venus Swirl Razor for free thanks to Venus.  IT IS AWESOME!  This is the first time in years that I haven&#x27;t cut myself shaving near my heals or on my knees.  This razor contours to your skin and glides across.  It makes shaving your knees, behind yours knees and close to your ankles so effortless.  The handle has a nice grip to it and it fits perfectly into your hand and fingers.  With the flexiball, it&#x27;s able to shift and bend so you get a nice smooth, close shave.  The 5 blades make sure that there is NO hair left behind!  It works wonderful for shaving your under arms, also!  It seems so much easier with the razor&#x27;s flexiball.  I&#x27;ve never gotten that close of a shave in my underarms!  I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this razor.  My old razor is in the garbage already!  This Venus razor is purple and has a super cute design! Everything should be cute!!</li>
    <li> This razor is so flexible and easy to use! It got all the hard to reach places with ease! One of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used! -I&#x27;m trying this for free from venus.</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try out from Gillette Venus.All in all this is a pretty decent razor.My skin is super sensitive and it was nice that i didnt get in razor burn however I would have liked my skin to feel a little smoother after using this product. This razor has a easy to handle design and is very easy to grip.I would say this is probably the best razor made for women that i have used.</li>
    <li> NO knicks or cuts!!  This is an awesome razor.  I am the type of person that will have bandaids all over my legs after shaving.  A. because I&#x27;m not very careful and B. because I didnt have a razor that curved to my legs.  This is a razor that will make your legs feel silky and smooth!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be chosen to test this product for free!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature would have to be the comb! I know that sounds a little silly. A comb on a razor,but it helps!&lt;br /&gt;Now in the winter time i am one of those ladies who dosent shave much so this razor had its work cut out for it. It tackled my yetti looking legs, arms, and bikini area like a champ! The 5 blades cut close and keep your legs smoother longer! I love this product and will use it again!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor that gives the closeness of a man&#x27;s razor. The head contains some serious moisturizers and didnt irritate my skin at all! I received this razor as a promotion from Venus and was anxious to try it out!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I got it for free for test. it is a great product it makes your skin feel so good and smooth yall have to try it.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette to try for free.  The first positive was that the package was easy to open.  We were off to a good start.  This razor is very easy and ergonomic to hold.  It didn&#x27;t once slip from my hand like the disposables I normally use.  I loved that it had a great grip on it.  I also loved that it contoured easily on my leg, around my knees and even my arm pits.  Usually the first time I use a new razor, I always end up cutting myself, either on my knee or ankle and this razor didn&#x27;t cut me!  I loved the razor while shaving my arm pits because I felt like I was able to get a good shave.  I&#x27;m not exactly a small person so my arm pits aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; and I felt like it was able to get into my arm pit well and able to maneuver the flab really well.  The downside, I figured the shave would last a bit longer than 1 day.  By the evening my legs were stubbly again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I went to use it for the second time, the purple part of the razor was starting to come off.  I think it&#x27;s just the &amp;#34;MoistureGlide serum&amp;#34; (which is just &amp;#34;shave gel&amp;#34; activated by the water) so I didn&#x27;t notice it impacting the razor at all, however, I think the more I use it, the more it will affect it.  I would have hoped it would have lasted a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Contours well&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic&lt;br /&gt;No more nicks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;MoistureGlide serum&amp;#34; starting to come off after first use&lt;br /&gt;Shave didn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> This is an amazing razor that left my legs flawless. It was able to get all my trouble spots with the first shave and I will never buy another razor!!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a promotion from Venus.  I have been using my husband&#x27;s razor for a while now because the women&#x27;s razors never seem to get a close enough shave but I will say that the Venus razor can compete.  The ball technology does seem to help it glide across the bumps of ankles a lot better than some of the other women&#x27;s razors.  The only thing is I wish that it came with a holder to attach it to the wall because the MoistureGlide Serum will stick to the tub or sink once it dries.  So if you are like me and just leave your razor on the side of the tub you will need to make sure that you turn it facing upwards otherwise you will have to pull pretty hard to detach.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this razor. I shave every day. Smooth legs are very important to me. However, I always, always always cut myself up. Especially when shaving the first time with a new razor, because of its sharpness. I have always used disposable razors and really liked the closeness of the shave, but not the cuts .  I was skeptical that the Venus swirl would be any different. WOW. Was I pretty amazed and impressed with the close shave AND no cuts. Plus at first I thought the grip would be awkward and uncomfortbale, like many razors are to me, but the venus was quickly liked by my hands. HOnestly the first few swipes felt a little out of sorts, but once I felt confident and comfortable and realized I was not getting knicked, things really improved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this razor from now on. I am very happy with the end results and the super close shave. My legs were so soft and smooth, I also used the violet swirl shave cream, which could have added to the softness, however I will test and try without to see the results!</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try for free from Venus and it is awesome! I have used men&#x27;s razors for over 5 years because I just wasn&#x27;t happy with the women&#x27;s razors that I had been trying but this razor changed that! I love the flexiball for getting around my ankle and I got a really nice smooth shave! Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This razor is great for women with sensitive skin who are looking for a nice, close shave. I personally had to use a men&#x27;s razor for the past few years since my skin would always get red bumps on them after shaving. With the men&#x27;s razors, there was options to get more blades which helped to minimize any red bumps after shaving and helped to get a nice close shave. I was so excited when Venus allowed me to try this product for free and I was not disappointed by the results. The razor glides smoothly over your skin so not much pressure is needed to shave and delivers a close shave without those wonderful nicks due to its flexibility on those tough areas such as the knees. There is a coating surrounding the razor which helps the razor the more easily glide over your legs which is nice but do not face your razor blades down in the shower as it may stick to the shower. Overall, I love this razor and I am so glad to see a women&#x27;s razor with so many blades.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be chosen by Venus to try out the new Venus Swirl Razor. When I first opened up the razor the first thing I noticed was the Flexiball. I was eager to try it out because of that feature because I tend to ALWAYS cut my legs when I shave and I was excited to see if the razor was up to the challenge. When I first used the Venus Swirl Razor I was completely amazed at how it glided down my leg. The 5 blades definitely got rid of every hair it encountered and I only had to go over my entire leg twice compared to about 3-4 times with other razors. The Flexiball made it easier to hug my body as the razor did its job. I am happy to say that I came out of the shower cut free. My only complaint would be that the Flexiball should be a little bit more flexible. I found it hard to get comfortable and to get in the groove of shaving since the Flexiball has a very limited movement. Hands down my favorite razor to date!</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette I was able to try the Venus Swirl for free.  The Venus Swirl razor is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used!  I&#x27;m always nicking my knees when I shave with other razors, but not the Venus Swirl razor.  The Flexiball technology makes shaving my knees so easy and painless.  And the Venus Swirl&#x27;s five contour blades give a super close shave and leave my legs feeling so smooth!  I would definitely recommend the Venus Swirl.</li>
    <li> Not quite sure if the ball really works or if it&#x27;s just a gimmick but I will say I love love love this razor! The only downside is there is no holder for it :(  if it had a holder it would get 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I received this razor and a Venus Swirl Shave gel for free from Bzzagent. Though I absolutely loved the shave gel, I wasn&#x27;t as enthusiastic about the razor. My initial thought upon receiving it was that the roller ball would allow it to reach all the hard to reach places, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. The rollerball gives this razor some flexibility, but very little (just a slight tilt). The shave was definitely a smooth shave, but because the razor cartridge is surrounded by a bulky rubber, I couldn&#x27;t really feel if it was shaving me or not (this may be a good thing to some people, but I like to feel my razor against my skin). Overall, the experience was ok. But thanks to Bzzagent  and Gilette for allowing me the opportunity to test this product.</li>
    <li> This razor is great. My only complaint is that it does not last as long as the Gillette fusion before needing to be replaced.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor with a super close shave. I love the way it left my legs feeling so silky smooth. What was so excellent was that I got it through bzzagent as a free promotion from Venus and it was awesome. If you haven&#x27;t tried it give it a shot it&#x27;s worth it, no doubt!</li>
    <li> This is one sleek razor!</li>
    <li> Venus sent me a razor to try for free. I have to say,  I was impressed. I usually use a men&#x27;s razor, but this one was pretty special.  Using it with their shave gel, I couldn&#x27;t even feel any of the razor&#x27;s 5 blades, and there wasn&#x27;t a hair to be found that was in the razor&#x27;s path.  Thank you, Venus!</li>
    <li> So delitghted to recieve this product from BzzAgent for free... smoothest, easiest shave ever... the way it glides over your skin you have to take a second look to make sure you believe what you see... definately my new favorite razor.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from bzzagent.com and at first I was like ok. Even after I got the razor I still was like OK . But after I used it I was like oooooohhhh ok good razor. I also went out and got the shaving cream with the coupon I got. And it works great. It does go with your body. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is after one use . I does seem like u would have to change the head. But with the shaving cream. It works ok to me .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor. Its one of the cleanest and closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had! I really enjoy the strips on the top and bottom of the razor that helps moisturize your skin. Theres no need to use a TON of shaving cream.... the razor does it all by itself with little to no help. It&#x27;s really easy to get behind my knees or near my ankles. Shoot, I even shaved my toes. I haven&#x27;t niched myself yet!!!! I love this! I also love that it&#x27;s purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to receive this product from BzzAgent.com thanks to Gilette! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I’d like to introduce you all to the Gillette Venus Swirl. I received this in the mail thanks to BzzAgent. It’s a razor that has a pivoting head due to the flexiball in the center of it. It has 5 blades and is very comfortable to hold onto, with a place to rest your thumb so that gripping it is easier.  I’m not one to try different kinds of razors. I’ve been using the same kind since I was in high school, the Gillette Fusion Razor for men, which is another razor with 5 blades, but I have to be honest in my statement that the Venus Swirl gives it a run for its money.  They both cost about the same, so price isn’t an issue. The question here is quality. The Venus Swirl gave me a close, smooth shave that was almost just as good as the Fusion (there was some stubble left here and there on my face and arms, but it was an insignificant amount).  My arm pits were a whole different story. I had not shaved my underarms for weeks when I used the Venus Swirl on them. It got rid of the hair in half the time it takes other razors to, and there was no stubble left behind. The flexiball really worked its magic on the contours of my underarm.  I love my Gillette Fusion and don’t plan on switching from it any time soon, but the Venus Swirl is a good razor (better than the Venus &amp; Olay Razor). I definitely recommend it to those of you who aren’t already stuck in the ways of a different razor like I am.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor, not the best but does the job, be watchful and pay close attention when shaving because it can cut you. Don&#x27;t leave it in the shower or at the very least dry it off because mine did get rusty fairly quickly. Overall I probably will just stick to my Venus Olay Razor. I didn&#x27;t care too much for the ball. Overall it is just okay. I did receive this product for free for testing purpose from bzz agent. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I received this razor for free from Venus and of course, I thought that if a company had to GIVE a product away for free that it wouldnt be worth buying.  BOY WAS I WRONG!!The flexiball technology in this razor really gives you the closest shave without having any nicks or cuts to worry about.  I typically shave with mens razors because I would find that every womens razor I tried just didnt give me the close shave that I longed for.  The blades seem to last alot longer than other disposable razors.</li>
    <li> The virus swirl is amazing. I just tried it yesterday. It really makes my legs feel smooth. It&#x27;s painless. it fits and conforms to the curves of my legs for a close shave. It has 5 blades but it is safe and has not caused any cuts. I was able to try this product for free thanks to buzz agent and Venus.</li>
    <li> I received this razor to try out from Gillette Venus. I was not so impressed by this razor. The razor was not flexible at all. My skin is super sensitive and I didn&#x27;t get any razor burn. It did not give me a close shave. For the price, I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Venus I got to try the Venus Swirl with FLEXIBALL technology for free and it was amazing! Best shave I ever got and left my skin feeling silky smooth with no missed spots and no nicks! The razor was comfortable to hold and glided across my skin flawlessly, no catching. I was able to get all the hair I wanted gone in ONE swipe! I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same spot over and over because those 5 blades and the piece that pulls the hair into the razor worked awesome. Best razor ever!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I purchased this new Venus shaver with the FLEXIBALL technology but WOW was I amazed at the ease of it gliding over those hard-to-reach places. It truly performed as advertised and as a result cut my shaving time down and left me with extremely smooth results. It has been two days and still no stubble. I&#x27;ve been using another Venus shaver for years and was happy with it but after using the Venus Swirl I&#x27;m 100% sold on the Flexiball technology and five Contour Blades. Anything that can save me time while still giving me exceptional results is a win win in my book.</li>
    <li> I been using  other brands  for years and after try gillette venus I feel  my skin smooth and the flexball allowed the razor to slide great on the skin and  thanks for venus I try this amazin product for free ...</li>
    <li> I received this from a promotion from the company. I would say it gave a close shave and was easy to hold. The ball made it a bit difficult to control though as it tended to want I slip side ways and I was worried about getting a nik. The head was also a bit large for my tastes so it made it a bit difficult getting into tight places.  Over all I think it lived up to it&#x27;s promises.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome, I got this thanks to Venus and bzzagent . It glides so smoothly, don&#x27;t have to go over same spot like I normally did with standard disposable razors. Left my legs feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a free sample from Gillette.  I was very excited to try a razor that had five blades.  The razor does a really great job of providing a close shave.  My legs were very smooth after I shaved.  It does glide really well over the skin.  However, I did not feel like it did a better job on my hard to shave places, like the knees, than any other decent razor.  For that reason I only give this product 4 stars.  It didn&#x27;t make my legs stay smooth for a longer period of time.  The next day I had regrowth like I usually do.  This is a pretty good razor, and is perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t mind shaving every day.</li>
    <li> I got this razor to try out for free (not from Gillette) and I love it! I usually use the plain original Venus razor but this one is WAY smoother! I thought there was a cap on it because it glides so smoothly! My knees and ankles weren&#x27;t a problem at all. I shaved my legs in (I swear it felt like) half the time and they feel amazing. :)</li>
    <li> The Venus Swirl razor is great! I achieved a close shave even on hard to maneuver areas like my knees. The grip is cushiony. I have always used Venus razors, but definitely liked this one best! I did receive this free to review, but will look to buy in the future!</li>
    <li> Today I received the new Swirl razor from Venus. I immediately noticed the deep violet color and &amp;#34;swirl&amp;#34; design - embossed into the rubber grip and in silver on the handle &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; - and I thought it was so pretty! The weight of the razor was lighter than a metal one but heavier than a disposable plastic one and felt balanced in my hand. Venus redesigned the handle in order to accommodate the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34;. It is slightly more rounded and the &amp;#34;pinky grip&amp;#34; has a flattened base but more closely follows the rounded handle shape than tapering out like the other Venus refillable women&#x27;s razors. Before attaching the blade cartridge, I played with the silver &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; to test it&#x27;s range of motion. It allows the razor head to pivot from side to side in addition to the flexing motion that is present in the other Venus products. The cartridge has 5 blades surrounded by a violet moisture strip. I cannot say how much moisture it added to my skin or even IF it added moisture during shaving because I used shave gel. Just below the blades is a tiny raised &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; for guiding the hair into the blades. I could not feel the comb against my skin or feel it guiding my hair so I&#x27;m not sure if that feature was beneficial to my shaving experience. Amazingly, the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; technology made shaving so quick and easy. I did not have to slow down around my knees, ankles or shins and shaving behind my knees was effortless. I did not nick myself or miss any hairs and my legs are so amazingly smooth! The only reason that I gave the Swirl 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had trouble rinsing the blades completely free of all hair. I will most definitely purchase additional cartridges if for no other reason than the ease of my shaving experience today. I can&#x27;t wait to see how long this ultra-close shave lasts!</li>
    <li> I got this razor from Venus for free as part of a promotion and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it! the flexible helps to keep me from cutting myself in those hard to reach places and it&#x27;s the close shave I&#x27;ve gotten from Venus since I started using razors from the brand. love it!</li>
    <li> What a smooth amazing shave I got with this razor. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. My husband actually even noticed and said he was cancelling our shave club because this is the smoothest my legs have ever been after shaving. My skin feels soft and silky smooth. No need for other razors if you own this one. I was able to shave around my knees with ease. I got to try these free from the company which makes this even better. Thanks Venus.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample razor with 1 Blade thru BuzzAgent &amp; I have to say this is one of the best products I have ever tried on their site!  The closeness of the shave &amp; the ease of the razor was the best I have ever tried by far!  From now on this will be the only razor I will ever use!  I have tried many different razors &amp; have never been completely satisfied with any of them.  Its about time they make a razor that is just perfect for women of all kinds!  Good Job Gillette!</li>
    <li> Best shave I have ever had on my underarms and knees! I always have missed hairs but with the Venus swirl I had not a single stray hair on my knees and my underarms were super smooth. The silver ball allows the razor to pivot easily and the head is very slender. The handle is slender but has grip on it so I had no problem using it safely in the shower. I received the razor from Gillette along with shave gel. I don&#x27;t usually use a shave gel, but this razor does need it to help the razor glide and as a result the two made my legs silky and sexy.</li>
    <li> I received the Venus Swirl razor from Venus for testing purposes. I was really excited to try this razor and experience the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; technology.In my opinion this razor is lacking a lot of swirl. The razor handle (ball part) moves side to side slightly and doesn&#x27;t move back and forth at all. I was really disappointed with the capabilities of the razor handle and found it slightly pointless for it to move from side to side.&lt;br /&gt;My next big issue I had with the razor was the blade itself. It is a 4 or 5 blade razor. The blades are all so tiny and close together. Which in my opinion caused it to not give me the smooth shave that my normal razor does. I also didn&#x27;t enjoy the size of the razor head itself....it&#x27;s huge!!! I mean trying to maneuver that big razor head in tight spots was quite tricky. I would possibly try this razor again if they developed a new razor head attachment for the handle, but other than that this product was not for me.</li>
    <li> UPDATED AFTER A MONTH OF USE, so I received the Venus Swirl Razor free from BUZZ-AGENT &amp; I&#x27;m glad I had the opportunity to try it  but now that i have used the Venus Swirl Razor I can give it more of a full review. There are a few dislikes and a few likes. Ill get the bad news out of the way. One thing i am not loving is the fact the razor gives me razor bumps after a few days. Never get them with my normal razor. Lastly it does not get that close of a shave like I am use to. Now on the flip/ good side I love the way the Flexiball moves feels while holding it. It grip is soft and has a rubber piece that fits perfectly in your hand. I love the feeling of the razor and how it glides across your body while shaving. It has a built in venus shave gel that lasts, in fact it still has the lubrication after a month of use. Over all i don&#x27;t mine using it, but when i need that close shave I still steal my husbands razor ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not normally very picky when it comes to razors. That being said, this one was nothing special. There is a little bit of movement because of the ball, but nothing that in my opinion enhances its ability to shave. The blade quality itself is average. I wouldn&#x27;t change from my current brand of men&#x27;s razors(i am a woman) to this one. If you are looking for a woman&#x27;s razor, this one does it&#x27;s job, just don&#x27;t expect anything special because of the pivoting head.&lt;br /&gt;I received this sample for free and agreed to give an honest opinion</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this razor, it help with shaving different parts of your leg and gets anywhere you want it because it&#x27;s so flexible. I liked the blades also, it definitely lasts over a month for me.  I would say if you never used one of the Venus razor before, you should get this one. Even though it&#x27;s a great razor and a little ball helps get a better shave, I don&#x27;t think I would have bought it since I have one of the Venus razors already. But it&#x27;s just me. Overall I&#x27;m very happy I got it for free from Gillette and BzzAgent and I&#x27;m looking forward to using it.</li>
    <li> I just love this razor! It is such a close shave that I don&#x27;t feel the need to shave the next day. I have not nicked myself yet... Even around my knees and ankles. This razor is a dream. I don&#x27;t usually buy razors with replaceable heads but this one is a keeper! Well done, Venus!</li>
    <li> This razor changed my attitude about shaving.  I like shaving now.  It glides so well even over the knees.  It works well even with very little shaving cream.  It also worked well in the most intimate areas.</li>
    <li> I got this to try along with the Violet swirl shave gel. I love it! 5 blades usually seem excessive.... But I got one of the smoothest shaves ever! Will definitely purchase in the future to continue to keep my smooth legs :-).</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying for a certain razor blade refill that&#x27;s the opposite of &amp;#34;out&amp;#34;-tuition so I began my search for the best at the right price. After a few tries and getting to re-experience razor bumps and ingrowns I reconsidered going back to the $5/refill. So glad I saw these first! They&#x27;re grrrrreat! Give &#x27;em a swirl!</li>
    <li> I love how the ball in the razor allows it to move with the form of your leg.  This allows you to get a close shave and even hit those hard to reach parts, like your knees!  It was probably the first time I didn&#x27;t have to go back and reshave afterwards.  Plus it didn&#x27;t actually feel like I was shaving.  The razor was so smooth against my skin.  Love that I was able to try this product for free from Venus, but will definitely be purchasing more in my future!</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the best razors I have used before!  I received it from Venus to try and I am so glad they did because I am in love with Venus again!  I was using a different brand but was getting annoyed by the closeness of the shave, and my skin was very irritated.  Once I tried this razor, my skin was never cut and never irritated and it provided a super close shave that I have not experience in a long time!  Also, I am not scared with the razor to shave my armpits, knees, ankles and bikini area, and it does not get irritated, which is a huge relief for me!  I will definitely be purchasing this from now on!  Thank you Venus!</li>
    <li> I was able to try this razor out for free thanks to Venus. First off, I was very happy with the packaging. I was able to get the razor out easily without using scissors and no cuts on my hands! The razor itself is beautiful, I really like the purple color. I used it on both my legs and underarms. It worked fine on my legs, although I did need to use extra lotion afterwards. It did give a really close shave though. I did end up with razor burn on my underarms though, hence the 3 stars. I think if the blades were a little thicker that wouldn&#x27;t happen, just my opinion.</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion from Venus. I was very happy with how my legs felt after shaving. I used with and without the Violet Swirl shave gel. This razor provided a close, smooth shave with both. The water activated moisture strip left my skin very silky without gel or cream. The Flexiball was a nice feature moving over my knee cap and behind the bend of my knee, no nicks, cuts, or pulling hair. My only complaint about the refills is the price. It turns an amazing shave into a luxury item and leaves me having to settle with another product, having to choose between half a tank of gas or a silky shave.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor for an equally awesome price.</li>
    <li> I had gotten to try this for free through Venus and I must say I love it. I always use to steal my husbands razor but now with this razor having 5 blades, I don&#x27;t have to take it no more due to it gets right down to my skin. It even leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and I don&#x27;t even have to shave them every other day!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome razor!I had received this item as a free promotion from Venus Swirl and I am so glad I got to try it out.  Usually I hate shaving,  but using this made things so much easier.  It curves in the hard to reach areas (back of knees,  etc...)  and when I used it,  it didn&#x27;t feel like one of those cheap disposable razors.  It glided so well over my legs that I checked after the first stroke to make sure it had actually worked.  Also I liked how the back of the shave head was open more.  It made it easier to clean.  I will be sticking with this razor from now on.</li>
    <li> A big thank you to Venus for letting me try this razor for free. This razor is absolutely wonderful. Very close and clean shave. Easy to get in the tricky places because of the flexiball being so flexible. The five blades makes your skin very smooth and soft. Long lasting shave. The design of the razor is wonderful. The grip on the razor is very good, no dropping it due to grip shortage. All in all I would recommend this razor to anyone, it is absolutely just amazing.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from Bzzagent to try out for FREE! It&#x27;s great! I love the ball in the handle for flexibility! Really makes for smooth legs and no nicks!</li>
    <li> I received this awesome product for free from Bzzagent and honestly it&#x27;s the best shaving product I have ever received. for almost a year Ive been using plastic disposable razors, my hair has always grown back.</li>
    <li> I got to try this razor free thanks to Venus. I really like the Flexball. It glided over my contours and gave me a really close shave. The handle is also really pretty.</li>
    <li> I got the chance to try this razor and the Venus Shave Gel Violet Swirl with Touch of Olay for free thanks to Venus and all I have to say is WOW! The combo is amazing! The razor gives me a nice close shave and the pivoting head keeps me from nicking myself. The head is not very flexible but it moves enough to keep myself from accidently moving the blade at a bad angle and nicking myself. It hugs my ankles and knees making that less of a headache. The shave gel smells INCREDIBLE and stays on thick to make shaving even smoother! I definitely plan on continuing to use this razor!</li>
    <li> I recently received this razor to try and I love it. It has a rubber grip that keeps it securely in your hand and a large razor head that flexes to your body. I was able to shave faster with no irritation!</li>
    <li> I receive this free as part of a promotion from the brand. So glad I did as this razor is amazing. First off, my armpits have never looked so good. Previously I felt like I would always miss some hair or it would still be visible somehow. Now with the Venus Swirl! Secondly, it glides along my legs like a dream. Its actually kind of fun to go from my ankle to my thigh without worrying about nicks or missing hair. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This razor is hands down the best razor I have ever used! I was lucky enough to receive this amazing razor free from Venus  and initially did not have high hopes.  Venus swirl razor with flexi ball is not a joke. The contour blades and the flexi ball are legit! I was quite amazed when I used this for the first time and could shave with ease! I highly recommend this to you and everyone!</li>
    <li> I was given the Venus Swirl Women&#x27;s Razor as a member of BzzAgent to try.  Here is my review:&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical using the Venus Swirl Razor.  I was already using a store brand 5 blade razor so I didn&#x27;t think I would get a closer shave.  I used the Venus Swirl Razor for a month and noticed I did get a smooth shave but saw most of the smoothness was from the Violet Swirl with Touch of Olay Shave Gel.  I did not see any point or difference with the flexball stuff so that is an unnecessary.  It wasn&#x27;t until I went back to my old razor that I noticed that the Venus razor with extra moisturizers actually did make the shave smoother.  It&#x27;s still really expensive compared to store brands, but with a coupon I could see myself buying regular Venus razors.</li>
