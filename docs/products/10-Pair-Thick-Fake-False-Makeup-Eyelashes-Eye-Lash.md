<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the staggered eyelashes that aren&#x27;t all straight across. The one&#x27;s in this photo depict the ones I like, but are not. The image is misleading. Disappointed. This happens a lot.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and affordable. I am using these for practice to apply fake lashes in my makeup class. The strip where you apply the glue is not the best, but for the price and practice. No complains!</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous! Easy to apply. The only thing negative I can say about these lashes is that you may have shape them to your eyes. They are a little stiff.</li>
    <li> great for the price, took a while to receive but it&#x27;s worth the wait</li>
    <li> they were nice beautiful</li>
    <li> Im all into thick eyelashes these were not what I expected they feel super plasticy and they&#x27;re hard too put on... I usually can get my other eyelashes within 1 minute I couldn&#x27;t even get these on ... Not worth waiting on them</li>
    <li> There awsome! Came quick</li>
    <li> I bought these for a movie that I was doing makeup for and found that they are much heavier feeling then the brands that you can get at any drug store. They look nice once they are on (you have to cut them to size because they are very large too).</li>
    <li> They are easy to put on and blend with your own lashes. Not the most natural looking but great for a more dramatic look. Not reusable but the amount of lashes is great.</li>
    <li> Love them very thick lashes I ordered 3pk</li>
    <li> I am very pleased, my purchase came in a timely manner and not damaged. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. The lashes are very cute, thick and long. The band is very thin though, which can be good or bad, for me it&#x27;s good since I can easily bend it to fit my eyes. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it came in terrible condition. The package was crushed, some of the lashes were damaged and I had to spend 10 minutes straightening them out.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Theses lashes were thick and they barely bend to follow the eyelid when putting them on. They are very stiff and in my opinion they aren&#x27;t worth the hassle of trying to put them on. I wouldn&#x27;t advise any one to purchase them. The quality is cheap just like the price. No deal.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy these lashes unless your using them for Halloween or something like that. They don&#x27;t look normal to just wear everyday .</li>
    <li> Meh. Good for night time. They look too plasticky in actual light. But good for the price. Perfect for cosplay or going out to the club. There actually easy to work with if you&#x27;ve put on eyelashes before, as with all lashes , you need patience. These in particular are kind of stiff which I like, BUT you have to time and put a lot of glue. Had to cut them which was fine, I cut all my lashes since my eyes are small. Do I recommend this product ? Sure, just not for everyday day time use.</li>
    <li> These lashes are great this is my second time ordering them and I will order more these lashes make my lashes real full and neautiful this is a great product!!! And good quality!!!</li>
    <li> Really liked them huge makeup junkie so these are amazing, only complaint is the actual box it came in was bent but the eyelashes were safe</li>
    <li> I love these lashes u bought 3 boxes an I am only  on my second box they last and there GREAT</li>
    <li> I love my eyelashes definitely will be getting some more.</li>
    <li> Awsomee lashes! Second time I buy and absolutely love them!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited about these lashes as I wear falsies on a daily basis. I was INLOVE once I opened these, there are a bit thick on the band but still not a really big issue. They are also able to cut to your own size if your eye is shaped smaller. However these lashes are fabulous Will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;OH and I also got them before my expected delivery time! How great!!</li>
    <li> Lovely. They look very authentic.</li>
    <li> Heavy and very fake !</li>
    <li> I really like these eyelashes. I just have to cut them to make them fit my eyes but they stay on all night. i only use them once so i dont have any input on re-use. but I order atleast 6  boxes of these a year</li>
    <li> Nothing&#x27;s wrong with them, they&#x27;re just not as appealing as I&#x27;d thought they&#x27;d turn out to be. They do look good on the girls who posted pictures with them on! I guess they just suit some over others. So you never know</li>
    <li> Hate them!!! So thick and cheap!!</li>
    <li> Too thick and hard, like really!!!? Am I supposed to use bonding glue to get them to stay on? This would damage the #! $*&amp; out of your eye lashes! If you dont care for having eye lashes anymore than this is for you!</li>
    <li> Got it at a perfect time! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Hate this product eyelash is stiff and is very hard to stick</li>
    <li> Yes these are FAKE LOOKING false eyelashes....if you are going to go all out glam don&#x27;t you want fabulous thick lashes!?! I love them, really make your eyes pop!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed about these lashes, upon reading the review I was excited, I love trying on the thicker lashes. But when I received them they couldn&#x27;t even bend to my lids. I tried everything with them and nothing worked I guess I just got the crappy ones? All of them were stiff and wouldn&#x27;t even bend to my lids, unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t even use any. Such a disappointment</li>
    <li> This item came much quicker than i expected. The eyelashes are for a cosplay I am gonna do. I love it and it work great</li>
    <li> I will be ordering more they are the best I&#x27;ve ordered more expensive and I&#x27;m in love with these lashe. I strongly recommend them and they feel like mink lashes but much durable and stronger</li>
    <li> This is very big and exaggerated in my opinion.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! Bought them for one cent and they are way better than MAC eyelashes that&#x27;s for sure! They don&#x27;t have any weird material (as reviewed before) they are made out of the same material most false eyelashes are made of!&lt;br /&gt;They look so pretty on too! One cent for ten of them? and they are sooo durable each pair of eyelashes will last me a lonnnngggg time! Really happy i grabbed these! They aren&#x27;t too dramatic and can be worn everyday if you like</li>
    <li> Love these! Very beautiful... I am a first time lash user and they seem very nice and fluffy without being too over the top&lt;br /&gt;  Chandell Arsenault&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> THIS WAS MY FIRST PURCHASED FOR MYSELF AND IAM HIGHLY PISSED THAT IT WILL TAKE THREE WEEKS TO A MONTH JUST TO RECIEVE MY PURCHASED AND I WILL NOT BE SPENDING ANY FURTHER MONEY AT THIS POINT</li>
    <li> When I first received the eyelashes I thought that they looked a bit plastic-y but once I tried them on their absolutely gorgeous it&#x27;s not a natural look but they&#x27;re not ridiculously long I think they&#x27;re the perfect length nicely noticeable.. I LOVE IT!!! Will most definitely purchase them again.</li>
    <li> They look really nice and exaggerated (which I love), but my only complaint is that they look a little plasticy and shiny. But a little mascara can cover that up enough.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these lenses before from last year and they are just as beautiful and flexible when you apply the right amount of adhesive, I use these lenses for cosplaying and if you were to apply to lashes on each lid it gives you that kawaii kawaii big anime eye look but on the other hand it makes you fell like a doll with medium heavy eyelids that flutter open and close if you widen your eyes or semi close them in comparison.These  10 pairs of eyelashes go a long way! Follow me on instagram @loli_rose_bunni :3</li>
    <li> Great deal! Arrived right on time (:</li>
    <li> Beautiful lashes will buy again</li>
    <li> It looks just like the picture. :)</li>
    <li> conm the product met my expectations. Shipping took a bit but it was worth . it is recommended :)</li>
    <li> Wife did not like them, too brittle, did not bend when applied.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes... a bit hard to put on because of the stiffness but I worked them right in..</li>
    <li> These are great! Super more cheaper than regular eyelashes &amp; the amount lasts forever. Did take awhile to arrive but it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Not the WORST eyelashes out there, but the base of the lashes are much too thick for them to form properly to your eye shape.  They work fine with very heavy eyeliner because you can mask it, but these are not suitable as regular falsies.</li>
    <li> i would have gave this a 5 star but sadly when i tryed to take one set of lashes out half of the lashes on the strip pulled out :( .....but otherwise i love how they look in the box and on my eyes, very nice! You can wear these everyday, not to dramatic but yet sexy!</li>
    <li> hard to remove fom box so it distorts the last</li>
    <li> For the prie, these are pretty cute. The only thing is the band is thick on these and the over hang over my eye is annoying that I always had to cut it off. Either way they&#x27;re okay; look a bit fake though.</li>
    <li> THEY REALLY LOOK NICE ON.</li>
    <li> I like them alot because they are so bid and it goes with my make up I will need some moee soon</li>
    <li> These are my first and they don&#x27;t seem that bad. (not that i have anything to compare it to) They are flexiable and have length. I just wish the packing was better so when i get done using them i can put them back. But that&#x27;s alright to because i will just put them in a small container or something.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time. I use them as one time use though. Great price.</li>
    <li> These lashes a huge I mean huge if your looking to make a statement these are it I bought them to wear when I perform being im a cheerleader and bigger the better they are fleshly and wonderful and I love them only one thing about them is that after a couple hours of wearing them they can start to be a little uncomfortable</li>
    <li> good for costumes...you can tell theyre  fake from a mile away</li>
    <li> this eyelashes are great and their pretty long too just like iwanted them to be! great for the price and i even got them earlier then expected.</li>
    <li> These lashes are not what they look like in the picture. They are thick, but with that also comes stiffness. Not the worst, but they were 2$ so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> These are the worst lashes ever they don&#x27;t stick, they look horribly fake, worst experience ever. never again.</li>
    <li> i am very happy  w them the are very goodif u are learning goit comes alot</li>
    <li> Definitely not for an everyday use. And they are worth exactly how much u pay for them.</li>
    <li> wife loves them, Thanks...</li>
    <li> I bought these for cosplay only. If u are look for eyelashes for every day wear, don&#x27;t buy these, they are WAY too obvious. For the look i was going for (dolly eyes FOR COSPLAY), they are perfect.idk what they&#x27;re made out of, they kinda feel like the lashes on a REAL baby doll..kinda plastic and thick..i love them tho :)</li>
    <li> Great buy cheap good quality</li>
    <li> they look and feel like a piece of paper :(</li>
    <li> Lovee them! Not to long or not to thick!</li>
    <li> Nice, it&#x27;s thin and easy to apply :)</li>
    <li> Since they are cheap, they are worth the price. But there should not be an excuse when it comes to the point where the item is filthy and balls of dust is in the &amp;#34;new box of false lashes&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The packaging I got said &amp;#34;Phone case&amp;#34; instead of Eyelashes, so I was scared that I got the wrong product. I&#x27;m glad it was mislabeled but the packaging was damaged. The false lashes were still undamaged though so that was good. I&#x27;m also glad it arrived early.</li>
    <li> Um, not the look for me.  Maybe it&#x27;s good for Halloween or if you perform on stage in very theatrical makeup.</li>
    <li> Very cheap feeling and stiff i couldnt get them to stay on</li>
    <li> The band is to big!!!  Not worth it at all!!!</li>
    <li> Awful! The band is very thick and not easy to work with at all. The best it could do would be to cut in half and use as a bottom lash for like Lolita or anime looks! That is the only thing I found them good to be for. I had such a hard time getting this to work because the band was so so so thick and very uncooperative.</li>
    <li> I only received 6 of the 10.</li>
    <li> These lashes are amazing~! For the price, of about one pair of drug store lashes, you can get 10 of these. I got them quick, and they were everything I expected. I will order from this seller again. These lashes are not too dramatic, and can be worn everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the 1 star review was deserved, they were not made of felt. They were made out of synthetic hair, and have a generous lash line, which makes for the application of glue easier. They don&#x27;t come with glue though. But that&#x27;s fine. I use the Dolly Wink eyelash glue, which is great.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes. Easy to apply . Would purchase these a again. Received on expected arrival date. Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love them will be buying more  in the near future</li>
    <li> I was going for a more natural look.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, but aren&#x27;t very cute</li>
    <li> i love these they are reuseable and very nice</li>
    <li> Terrible.  extremely plasticy and uncomfortable the band is too thick made my eyes sore and they just look cheap:/</li>
    <li> I would never purchase this product again. Their cheap and not durable and insanely hard to put on. I&#x27;ve used fake eyelashes many times before but these are the hardest and worst ever</li>
    <li> Too hard, they don&#x27;t form to the eyelid well, so they don&#x27;t stay down properly for the glue to hold them.</li>
    <li> These are beautiful, thick, full, flirty. They are super black and feel luxurious and soft. For the price I am amazed at the quality of these handmade lashes. Gorgeous. So happy.</li>
    <li> The cheapest, stiffest, hardest lashes I&#x27;ve ever worn. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> They are good but the lash band looks to fake</li>
    <li> They look cheap and drag queenish!!! They really don&#x27;t hold well. If u need them for a costume, u should be fine!</li>
    <li> The tracks on these eyelashes are so thick, I had to use black hair bonding glue for the lash to lay down flat, and a blow dryer to keep the track in place until dry. Nice length and not to long. You can also sleep in these lashes without them balling up out of place. Will I order again.....very unsure</li>
    <li> i still have them months laters&lt;br /&gt; i love them</li>
    <li> Worst lashes ever the look like plastic,I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them I hate them.</li>
    <li> Great, but it takes a lng time to get a shipment delivered.  Now I just order 100 at a time</li>
    <li> Are as pictured...really thick, dark lashes</li>
    <li> looks like totally fake,</li>
    <li> When I got it, the lashes were all smashed and curled weirdly. Also it&#x27;s really hard to work with. Too thick and kept popping off of my eye lids. You have to cut it to pieces or something i don&#x27;t know. Never gonna buy these ever again</li>
    <li> if I could rate 0 I would! box was all ripped lashes all messed up not satisfied at ALL !</li>
    <li> I only gave one star because you can&#x27;t give a negative amount but if I could have I would!!! DO NOT ORDER THESE, they are cut out of a cheap felt or something. I threw them all away!!!  WHAT A RIP OFF</li>
    <li> If you wear lashes often, this is the best deal ever.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected!!</li>
    <li> Ugly. So ugly. When I first opened the package, the first word that came out of my mouth was &amp;#34;wtf?&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Took a while to arrive, but worth it.  These are great for theatre.</li>
    <li> Thick but not to much. I am not really an false eyelash girl but this is great. I will need to buy an eyelash curler though they come out very straight.</li>
    <li> They are too heavy and feel like plastic instead of natural lash hair.</li>
    <li> Not as thick as advertised but I really like them.  Very easy to put on</li>
    <li> They are not as good quality but aren&#x27;t so bad .</li>
    <li> This is, like, my 6th time buying these lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I love them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are plastic, so they are harder to put on. Practice is key with these babies!</li>
    <li> These lashes are hard to apply. I wear lashes daily so i&#x27;m no amateur.It&#x27;s NOT human hair and definitely not for everyday. I use it for shows and that&#x27;s it. Not my fave.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the thickness of these lashes</li>
    <li> Just as good as the high end lashes just&lt;br /&gt;About 20 dollars cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;But you do have to trim the ends,&lt;br /&gt;Worth the wait &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many different false eye lashes and these by far were the worse purchase. Took about 3 weeks to deliver and it appeared they had been run over by a commercial sized vehicle and now are also pointing in every direction eyelashes shouldn&#x27;t . They are very straight and the natural eye curves therefore they will NOT fit properly. They are of no use to me but I refuse to waste any additional time or money to send them back to the hills of west bubble china</li>
    <li> Look great on and got here quicker than expected.</li>
    <li> Worst lashes on the planet! They feel like plastic and they don&#x27;t stay on. Hence why they&#x27;re so cheap!!</li>
    <li> Very hard texture made it hard for them to bend.</li>
    <li> AY these are amazing! So beautiful and luscious! id recommend these to anyone that wants full long eye lashes. buy em!</li>
