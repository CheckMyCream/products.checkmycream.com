      <li>My wife has been using KMS styling gel for 15+ years, so she must love it.</li>

      <li>great hold, minimal flaking by the day&#x27;s end</li>
      <li>Good enough for Robert Smith of The Cure, good enough for me!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
      <li>The smell that everyone is talking about is not bad.  </li>
      <li>It lingered in my car for hours and was still pretty strong.</li>
      <li>Received quickly from seller.</li>
      <li>Arrived in quick time</li>
      <li>The old formula smelled better but it&#x27;s not bad now.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years in my boys hair, would never use anything different not only does this gel work very good</li>
      <li>give you an idea of how powerful the smell is....  </li>
      <li>This stuff works so well with my perm, and the price was definitely right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to toss an almost full 25.3 oz.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>I like the gel nice and strong for my thick hair.</li>
      <li>Liking the cheap stuff I usually use better.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair flakey at all and has a slight (but sexy) salon fragrance to it as well to keep you looking, feeling and smelling fresh all day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tries many hair gels in my time and this one does the job.  </li>
      <li>The smell has changed but doesn&#x27;t matter much to</li>
      <li>many other gels bu always return to KMS</li>
      <li>created this new ingredient and approved it should be fired!</li>
      <li>I stopped purchasing this a couple of years ago when they switched from the mild smelling pink-capped cranberry smell, to this toxic gas-smelling &#x27;pepper&#x27; blue bottle.  </li>
      <li>main thing I was concerned about was the hold it has.  </li>
      <li>As long as it smells clean, that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
      <li>I definitely noticed the new smell right away.</li>
      <li>so, i went ahead and ordered a bottle of the new stuff.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough about the quailty of this gel.</li>
      <li>My hear aired out</li>
      <li>mouth bottle is helpful with emptying it out when it&#x27;s nearly gone.</li>
      <li>so i tried unsuccessfully to locate bottles of the old formula.</li>
      <li>I have been using KMS since high school when they used to be in a light yellow bottle with black lettering.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve learned to tolerate the new &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34;, but apparently it smells stronger to others around me, based on comments from friends and coworkers as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very similar to how the older version of this smelled,</li>
      <li>Please go back to the classic honeysuckle fragrance</li>
      <li>New bottle with same great gel, but has a bad smell.</li>
      <li>unless KMS goes back to the old &amp;#34;cranberry&amp;#34; fragrance, i&#x27;m going to have to look for an alternative.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, but worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I was afraid of the new bottle since many people were complaining of the smell.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and this gel is thick and heavy enough to hold it through my 10hr work shifts without looking like one of the dudes in Night at the Roxbury.</li>
      <li>Good product, my bf doesn&#x27;t notice any bad smells as others have said in reviews online...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love KMS, it came one day after I ordered it.  I don&#x27;t know why other reviews say this stinks.  It smells fine to me.</li>
    <li> I stopped purchasing this a couple of years ago when they switched from the mild smelling pink-capped cranberry smell, to this toxic gas-smelling &#x27;pepper&#x27; blue bottle.  The latest good reviews seem to indicate that maybe they learned from this and reformulated their scent and so I decided to give it another try.  Unfortunately, the same unbearable toxic scent is still there - the smell is so strong that it stays in your fingers and towels after several washes.  It&#x27;s truly unbearable and nauseating.</li>
    <li> was really good and what I ordered</li>
    <li> I like the gel nice and strong for my thick hair. But it does get crusty after awhile...</li>
    <li> very happy! at least my hair is...LOL</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well with my perm, and the price was definitely right. I even told my hairdresser about it</li>
    <li> I use this product on a regular basis.  Arrived in quick time</li>
    <li> I sport an old-school flattop (slightly longer than normal). This is by far the best styling gel I&#x27;ve tried. It holds well, lasts the entire day and yet doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve glued or greased my hair (it can flake a bit if you overdue it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product can be difficult to find locally and is typically much more expensive. I&#x27;ve had repeatedly good experiences buying it hear on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Excellent hold and no flaking. I&#x27;ve used this gel for ten years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Good price.  This lasts me well over a year!&lt;br /&gt;wide mouth bottle is helpful with emptying it out when it&#x27;s nearly gone.</li>
    <li> my husband&#x27;s favorite hair gel for many years... great hold, minimal flaking by the day&#x27;s end</li>
    <li> With gel I think it all depend on the look you are going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde finer hair, but lots of it and I style it just slightly messy. I apply this gel to my hair when it is dry. (When I apply it to wet hair, it looks wet all day). I would say it has a medium hold. My hair does not have the spiky look but has some hold to it. I can ran my hands through my hair easily, but it still holds its shape. That is why I like it. I have tried things like Axe styling gel and others and my hair goes flat after a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is perfect for me</li>
    <li> Good enough for Robert Smith of The Cure, good enough for me!</li>
    <li> The hold is still great, but my wife has threatened to leave me (hopefully said in jest) if I don&#x27;t find another product. I&#x27;ve learned to tolerate the new &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34;, but apparently it smells stronger to others around me, based on comments from friends and coworkers as well. After a good workout, the stench is really amplified. Sorry KMS. Please go back to the classic honeysuckle fragrance and maybe I&#x27;ll come back to you.</li>
    <li> I love the product and the hold is just right for my hair. But like a lot of other reviewers, I find the scent unpleasant. I wish KMS would bring back the honeysuckle scent. I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good packaging, no leaks. Fresh new product, good price.</li>
    <li> New bottle with same great gel, but has a bad smell.</li>
    <li> Works great. Multiple year supply for a guy.</li>
    <li> Liking the cheap stuff I usually use better.  Sorry</li>
    <li> I have been using KMS since high school when they used to be in a light yellow bottle with black lettering.  I was afraid of the new bottle since many people were complaining of the smell.  The smell has changed but doesn&#x27;t matter much to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing I was concerned about was the hold it has.  I have thick, coarse, hair which store bought gel never seems to work.  Seems to be just as strong as the KMS I have used for the past 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price here is excellent also.</li>
    <li> Good but not as good as the old formula.  Hold and flaking is the same and very good.  The smell that everyone is talking about is not bad.  It&#x27;s more like a beauty saloon smell.  The old formula smelled better but it&#x27;s not bad now.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great, &amp;#34;NO FLAKES&amp;#34;, no damage to hair, not greasy, just a great product. The attention to customer service is very good, product arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> Good product, my bf doesn&#x27;t notice any bad smells as others have said in reviews online... He was using it before the package change and yes it smells different now with the blue packaging as the product has been modified, but it works just as well as before. He is happy with this product so I am too.</li>
    <li> I have been using KMS hair gel since 2002. My Barber introduced me to it as the best hold and shine money can buy. I lean towards agreeing to that statement. The smell of the product is not great but it&#x27;s not bad at all. There are products that smell far worse scented or not. As long as it smells clean, that&#x27;s all that matters. I haven&#x27;t even noticed a change in fragrance since I started using this product. I am about to buy one now because I&#x27;m running low.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a permanent hair styling gel that I can use for my luscious, hard to maintain, wavy hair that I like to comb forward and raise it from the front and I found it in KMS California. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair flakey at all and has a slight (but sexy) salon fragrance to it as well to keep you looking, feeling and smelling fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Received quickly from seller.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough about the quailty of this gel. I bought the gel before and it has lasted me a very long time. I use it every other day.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years in my boys hair, would never use anything different not only does this gel work very good it smells good as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using KMS Styling Gel for over 15 years. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t clump, only slightly shiny when used, and does a decent job holding my wavy hairy. I definitely noticed the new smell right away. It&#x27;s very similar to how the older version of this smelled, just more potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea of how powerful the smell is....  I went to work and put on some gel... drove 15 min to the office, went to work for 8 hours.... came out to the parking lot and sat in my car and I got a huge whiff of the smell from the gel. It lingered in my car for hours and was still pretty strong. My hear aired out so I didn&#x27;t smell up the office but I was definitely taken aback from the smell in the car. I still like the gel.... and the smell is not that bad just overwhelming sometimes.</li>
    <li> Been using this gel for years! My hair is very fine and this gel is thick and heavy enough to hold it through my 10hr work shifts without looking like one of the dudes in Night at the Roxbury. It smells fine, its not like it smells like a cat litter box or something! hahaha</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tries many hair gels in my time and this one does the job.  They changed the scent of this gel a few times, and this is by the far the worst.  Otherwise it would get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I agree with one previous poster. I have been using the KMS HairStay styling gel for years and loved it but this new formula just smells nasty. And it stays on your hands and hand towels, etc. I&#x27;m getting ready to toss an almost full 25.3 oz. bottle and will try to find another product to use. Sorry, KMS, I think you lost me with this change.</li>
    <li> This product has been around for many years and it&#x27;s the best firm-hold gel you can buy.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. No complaints!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using the KMS hairstay gel for over a decade but i was down to my last little bit. i read with trepidation all the other reviews that said the new formula stinks so i tried unsuccessfully to locate bottles of the old formula. so, i went ahead and ordered a bottle of the new stuff. well, on one hand, it doesn&#x27;t smell like rotting garbage (which is good), on the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t smell nice either. i would describe it as kind of &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34;-smelling. the worst part though is that it is strong. even if i use the smallest amount in my hair, i can smell it. and, if i can smell it, everyone around me will be able to too. i&#x27;m kind of bewildered by KMS&#x27;s move here...what in the world were they thinking?!? bad, bad move. unless KMS goes back to the old &amp;#34;cranberry&amp;#34; fragrance, i&#x27;m going to have to look for an alternative.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for years. I have fine curly hair that has a mind of its own. This gel seems so thick but used in the correct amount it helps create lift and control. I have used many other gels bu always return to KMS</li>
    <li> Really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using KMS Hair Stay Gel for 20+ years. From time to time KMS will change their bottle packaging and/or fragrant of the gel.  However, their latest change(to the bluish/green bottle) to fragrant is absolutely awful; it leaves a nasty stench on your hair and hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever created this new ingredient and approved it should be fired!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using KMS styling gel for 15+ years, so she must love it.</li>
