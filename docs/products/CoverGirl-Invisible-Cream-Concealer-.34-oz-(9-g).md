      <li>Great coverage, not &#x27;cakey&#x27; or unnatural, great color that blends well.</li>
      <li>The Amazon price was great.</li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>and if you apply it and wait 5 min then wipe away any creasing then you will be good for the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>thought it important as a man to show this products versatility and also needed to share for me how perfectly it blends into my skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and have been very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>love!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found such a great deal on this, love those add on items!</li>
      <li>It looks natural and blends in perfectly with the tone of the rest of my face.  </li>
      <li>Great product and does exactly what it claims.</li>
      <li>and I still prefer this some days its lighter and creamier than my nars under eye canceler and has a much better finish</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and the coverage is better than anything I&#x27;ve found for a lot more money at the make-up counter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than any Almay or Revlon concealer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>One of the be top concealers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product,especially this great price.</li>
      <li>I would say this provides a medium maybe full coverage and has a nice hydrating feel to it.</li>
      <li>I love this light coverage concealer.</li>
      <li>There is nothing like it available for men so to women&#x27;s cosmetics I went.  </li>
      <li>The formula is light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>No matter how lightly I applied it, the product would &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34; in some of the lines on my face.</li>
      <li>Been using this for years, and it works for my light rosacea -- covers it well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
      <li>It goes on nice and smooth and blends really well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 54 year old male and take very good care of my skin - always have.  </li>
      <li>So this concealer works great just to touch up a few spots here and there without putting foundation on, which can clog pores.</li>
      <li>the price is worth it</li>
      <li>This product simply and effectively has been taking care of the problem for over a year now.  </li>
      <li>I am a makeup artist and I work with high end products which I also get for free because of the company I work for</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like wearing a lot of make up in the summer since it&#x27;s so hot</li>
      <li>I use it mostly for under my eyes and to attempt to cover the occasional blemish.  </li>
      <li>As the day goes on, even if I sweat a lot in the summer, it never runs off, and it actually seems to blend in even better as the day progresses.  </li>
      <li>This CoverGirl product is exactly what a concealer should be - it provides &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Thanks CoverGirl for helping out this man.  </li>
      <li>my whole life up to now.  </li>
      <li>, I really can&#x27;t comment</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I used to buy a high end department store line concealer.</li>
      <li>It seems to stay on fine and the wear is expected.</li>
      <li>I use a soap for sensitive skin and a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It actually covers my blemishes (it goes on pretty opaque if you dab it on), and it stays on for a long time.</li>
      <li>coverage (no further make-up required) or a perfect base for additional make-up (foundation, powder, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Block defect effect in general</li>
      <li>IF you are looking for a very rosy shade, absolutely devoid of any yellow/beige/light tan undertones, this is not the one for you.  </li>
      <li>I only ever need to reapply it if I wash my face a second time with water in the early evening which makes sense.  </li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than I expected but it&#x27;s a very good concealer! I just need to tan some and it&#x27;ll be perfect Lol :D</li>
    <li> One of the be top concealers I&#x27;ve used. It actually covers my blemishes (it goes on pretty opaque if you dab it on), and it stays on for a long time. I would definitely recommend it. It&#x27;s better than any Almay or Revlon concealer I&#x27;ve used. Just a small dab will do you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and the coverage is better than anything I&#x27;ve found for a lot more money at the make-up counter.</li>
    <li> Serves the purpose, not the greatest concealer, but not the worst.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 54 year old male and take very good care of my skin - always have.  I use a soap for sensitive skin and a moisturizer.  For some reason over the past year my nose gets red and there are sometimes very minimal bumps.  I have been told it is not acne, not blackheads and that it is just my regular skin tone.  Very frustrating for this was never an issue my whole life up to now.  Then I tried this CoverGirl invisible concealer.  There is nothing like it available for men so to women&#x27;s cosmetics I went.  This product simply and effectively has been taking care of the problem for over a year now.  I put a small amount of moisturizer on my nose and then put two small dabs of the concealer on and just blend it into the skin of my nose.  It miraculously makes the redness disappear without looking like I have makeup on my nose.  It looks natural and blends in perfectly with the tone of the rest of my face.  As the day goes on, even if I sweat a lot in the summer, it never runs off, and it actually seems to blend in even better as the day progresses.  I only ever need to reapply it if I wash my face a second time with water in the early evening which makes sense.  Then I just apply it the same way and it performs just as well the second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it important as a man to show this products versatility and also needed to share for me how perfectly it blends into my skin.  A little goes a long way for effectiveness, my simple problem of a red nose is now gone and no one ever knows I am wearing concealer.  Thanks CoverGirl for helping out this man.  Highly recommend this product.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and I work with high end products which I also get for free because of the company I work for and I still prefer this some days its lighter and creamier than my nars under eye canceler and has a much better finish and if you apply it and wait 5 min then wipe away any creasing then you will be good for the rest of the day. I would say this provides a medium maybe full coverage and has a nice hydrating feel to it. love!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really weird color. I have a reddish tint to my skin but this stuff is orange&#x27;ish.</li>
    <li> Great Coverage when needed. But needs Reapply</li>
    <li> Great product and does exactly what it claims.</li>
    <li> For me it barley covered my acne</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, and it works for my light rosacea -- covers it well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and have been very pleased with it. The brick and mortar price has gotten out of hand.  The Amazon price was great.</li>
    <li> Great coverage, not &#x27;cakey&#x27; or unnatural, great color that blends well. I highly recommend this product,especially this great price.</li>
    <li> I got this Covergirl Concealer as an add on item. I got a really great deal on it too. I chose medium since summer is here and I&#x27;m about to get so sun. I don&#x27;t like wearing a lot of make up in the summer since it&#x27;s so hot and I sweat. So this concealer works great just to touch up a few spots here and there without putting foundation on, which can clog pores. It goes on nice and smooth and blends really well. It&#x27;s the perfect shade for summer. I&#x27;m so happy I found such a great deal on this, love those add on items!</li>
    <li> Helps to cover dark circles and age spots.</li>
    <li> The concealer itself may be alright, I really can&#x27;t comment because the color was so off, it&#x27;s not useable.  IF you are looking for a very rosy shade, absolutely devoid of any yellow/beige/light tan undertones, this is not the one for you.  Trust me, this formula has that much red in it.  Not for me at all!</li>
    <li> i used this all the time. i like the products. not too bad. the price is worth it</li>
    <li> Block defect effect in general</li>
    <li> I bought this with a coupon and have been very happy with it.  I use it mostly for under my eyes and to attempt to cover the occasional blemish.  The formula is light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It seems to stay on fine and the wear is expected.</li>
    <li> I love this light coverage concealer. It helps cover blemishes and hyperpigmentation. I used to buy a high end department store line concealer. No matter how lightly I applied it, the product would &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34; in some of the lines on my face. This CoverGirl product is exactly what a concealer should be - it provides &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; coverage (no further make-up required) or a perfect base for additional make-up (foundation, powder, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t really go wrong giving this a try w/ the low cost. Plus, it&#x27;s a quality concealer.</li>
