      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>I have ordered Hair Illusion after reading good reviews on amazon.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more than happy to say that out of the 100</li>
      <li>The fibers tend to clump a bit upon application and fly aways during application get and stick on your face, so make sure to re-wash your face afterwards.</li>
      <li>Hair illusion has given me the most confidence!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t liked.  </li>
      <li>It gives very good scalp coverage and looks natural - much better than the well-known keratin fiber products I have tried before finding this.  </li>
      <li>Well sure, about 75% of it does...</li>
      <li>This is my second buy because it&#x27;s excellent blending with the thinning hair.</li>
      <li>However, it comes off on the hands just on touching it after application.  </li>
      <li>More fibers ended up my body then my scalp.  </li>
      <li>gonna get more when I get paid,  </li>
      <li>Looks better the more you blend it out.  </li>
      <li>I am also really impressed with the fact the CEO/founder is accessible and available to chat with directly if you have questions.</li>
      <li>I have tried some other hair loss concealing products and find that Hair Illusion looks amazingly like my own hair!  </li>
      <li>Product looks good when it&#x27;s IN, however falls out very easily with even a slight rub or tap against relevant area.</li>
      <li>Product has good potential .</li>
      <li>The company was good enough to provide me with a refund</li>
      <li>I am extremely pleased with my daily appearance and Noone has been able to detect that I&#x27;m concealing a bald spot.  </li>
      <li>There are many similar products, and in my ipinew topic is match better.</li>
      <li>I am still working with it, but so far this is a great product, will definitely be ordering again.</li>
      <li>just receive satisfied so far</li>
      <li>While the product wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
      <li>I found it ok, but kinda messy, they say its charged with static to help stick to your head...</li>
      <li>Just mess around with it till it looks good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy just the price a little too high</li>
      <li>Thank you so much !</li>
      <li>is way better than any similar products (after having used Caboki and Hair Illusion) in the market.  </li>
      <li>i Will definitely look forward to buying  more products</li>
      <li>That being said, i really like it and the restored hairline.</li>
      <li>Product really does not stay in place as promised.</li>
      <li>Really works well.  </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>it clearly falls off and furthermore yes I used hair spray glue!!.</li>
      <li>I was very worried that this product would not blend  in seamlessly and would look unnatural.  </li>
      <li>pretty embarrassing if you&#x27;re out in public</li>
      <li>JUST WOW !</li>
      <li>Works great for small empty spaces... but for big bald spots this wont work out to well.  </li>
      <li>Toppik works effectively even on thin hair and looks very natural on my hair.  </li>
      <li>once IN blends well with natural hair.</li>
      <li>Makes me look and feel young again.</li>
      <li>hopefully that will have some benefit but other than that it just drops straight to the bottom, not so much if u use hairspray but still drops and it looks unnatural and all i have is a widows peak</li>
      <li>Inside or outside in direct sunlight</li>
      <li>I am only 20 years old.</li>
      <li>I starting crying seeing my edges full again.</li>

<li> Toppik works effectively even on thin hair and looks very natural on my hair.  </li>
<li> once IN blends well with natural hair.</li>
<li> Makes me look and feel young again.</li>
<li> hopefully that will have some benefit but other than that it just drops straight to the bottom, not so much if u use hairspray but still drops and it looks unnatural and all i have is a widows peak</li>
<li> Inside or outside in direct sunlight</li>
<li> I am only 20 years old.</li>
<li> I starting crying seeing my edges full again.</li>
<li> Use a small comb or anything you can think of really.  </li>
<li> I do wish it came in grey too</li>
<li> Not good if you sweating it will wash out and don&#x27;t get stuck in the rain because it will wash away and that can be very Embarrassing  unless</li>
<li> Also, applicator holes are so small that it takes FOREVER to apply complete coverage of thinning/bald area.</li>
<li> and when I tried to use this product, it straightaway drops on my scalp first, rather than on my thin hair</li>
<li> it just looks like u got a haircut and all those little hairs stuck to your face, havent tried it for facial hair</li>
<li> So socially, it&#x27;s extremely rough for me if I have no solution.</li>
<li> the other 25% ends up coming off here and there, but all in all it does the job.</li>
<li> Product did not blend in as well as other products I have used.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other products on the market to no avail.  </li>
<li> /&gt;You use it indoor only Lolo so not good</li>
<li> It falls down in few hours</li>
<li> a little hair spray takes care of that.</li>
<li> Also the holes are too little for the product to come out.</li>
<li> and then it gets to the hair, leaving the scalp really messy.  </li>
<li> Basically, for the price charged, not much better than Toppik, since both are a mess.</li>
<li> As with any fiber product, there can be a little flaking (very little) of those hair fibers that haven&#x27;t adhered fully but</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t tell my edges was thin.</li>
<li> Too expensive.</li>
<li> sorry about. ..</li>
<li> I have very thin hair</li>
<li> I was so very wrong.  </li>
<li> I just want to say that I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to cover up my severe bald spots, and have been disappointed time after time.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll stick with Caboki until science catches up with this stupid issue.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is my second buy because it&#x27;s excellent blending with the thinning hair. Makes me look and feel young again.</li>
    <li> Product looks good when it&#x27;s IN, however falls out very easily with even a slight rub or tap against relevant area. Also, applicator holes are so small that it takes FOREVER to apply complete coverage of thinning/bald area. Otherwise once IN blends well with natural hair. Currently using Toppik...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product. It&#x27;s very gritty and when you comb your hair the product winds up on your shoulders and then of course if you have on a dress or shirt, it winds up on your clothing.</li>
    <li> Works great for small empty spaces... but for big bald spots this wont work out to well.  I found it ok, but kinda messy, they say its charged with static to help stick to your head... Well sure, about 75% of it does... the other 25% ends up coming off here and there, but all in all it does the job.</li>
    <li> It falls down in few hours</li>
    <li> Really works well.  Looks better the more you blend it out.  Use a small comb or anything you can think of really.  Just mess around with it till it looks good.  That should serioulsly be the directions.  That being said, i really like it and the restored hairline.</li>
    <li> I was very worried that this product would not blend  in seamlessly and would look unnatural.  I was so very wrong.  I&#x27;ve tried other products on the market to no avail.  I am extremely pleased with my daily appearance and Noone has been able to detect that I&#x27;m concealing a bald spot.  Hair Illusion is the Best!</li>
    <li> Product did not blend in as well as other products I have used.</li>
    <li> Wont stick at all it just looks like u got a haircut and all those little hairs stuck to your face, havent tried it for facial hair hopefully that will have some benefit but other than that it just drops straight to the bottom, not so much if u use hairspray but still drops and it looks unnatural and all i have is a widows peak</li>
    <li> Product has good potential . However, it comes off on the hands just on touching it after application.  It needs to be treated in some way to avoid flaking and coming off on one&#x27;s hands or on pillows.</li>
    <li> The product is well-made  i Will definitely look forward to buying  more products</li>
    <li> Not good if you sweating it will wash out and don&#x27;t get stuck in the rain because it will wash away and that can be very Embarrassing  unless&lt;br /&gt;You use it indoor only Lolo so not good</li>
    <li> Mie sincer sa spun nu mi-a placut.  I don&#x27;t liked.  sorry about. ..</li>
    <li> They shouldn&#x27;t advertise it stays on even in wind when you shake your head over the sink it clearly falls off and furthermore yes I used hair spray glue!!. pretty embarrassing if you&#x27;re out in public you know that&#x27;s why we buy the item.</li>
    <li> Product really does not stay in place as promised. Hair fibers simply fall out, so please do not comb your brush or comb. Basically, for the price charged, not much better than Toppik, since both are a mess.</li>
    <li> There are many similar products, and in my ipinew topic is match better.</li>
    <li> I am really happy to have found this product.  It gives very good scalp coverage and looks natural - much better than the well-known keratin fiber products I have tried before finding this.  As with any fiber product, there can be a little flaking (very little) of those hair fibers that haven&#x27;t adhered fully but a little hair spray takes care of that.</li>
    <li> Even though it is supposedly &amp;#34;natural hair&amp;#34; it looks chalkier and faker than Caboki. Also the holes are too little for the product to come out. I&#x27;ll stick with Caboki until science catches up with this stupid issue.</li>
    <li> Amazing product works wonders!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product that met explanations as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy just the price a little too high</li>
    <li> I have tried some other hair loss concealing products and find that Hair Illusion looks amazingly like my own hair!  Thirty years of thinning gone in about one minute. I am also really impressed with the fact the CEO/founder is accessible and available to chat with directly if you have questions. What a great product!!</li>
    <li> The product would not stick to my hair or scalp. It would fall off on my clothing.</li>
    <li> It works great gonna get more when I get paid,  it works great thank God for science</li>
    <li> Too expensive. More fibers ended up my body then my scalp.  Going back the cheaper fibers for fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much ! I just want to say that I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to cover up my severe bald spots, and have been disappointed time after time. I am only 20 years old. So socially, it&#x27;s extremely rough for me if I have no solution. I&#x27;m more than happy to say that out of the 100+ products I&#x27;ve tried. Hair illusion has given me the most confidence! Again, THANK YOU</li>
    <li> The fibers tend to clump a bit upon application and fly aways during application get and stick on your face, so make sure to re-wash your face afterwards.</li>
    <li> While the product wasn&#x27;t right for me. I can see where it can help some people in need. The company was good enough to provide me with a refund</li>
    <li> I have ordered Hair Illusion after reading good reviews on amazon.  However, this product is not for me.  I have very thin hair and when I tried to use this product, it straightaway drops on my scalp first, rather than on my thin hair and then it gets to the hair, leaving the scalp really messy.  I have been using Toppik and Toppik is way better than any similar products (after having used Caboki and Hair Illusion) in the market.  Toppik works effectively even on thin hair and looks very natural on my hair.  So, for me, its a no to Hair Illusion.</li>
    <li> the product is perfect, i will be ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;  thanks</li>
    <li> Yesss!!!!!! I starting crying seeing my edges full again. I was sweating I splashed water to simulate rain I used my blow dryer to simulate wind and NO RUNS!!!!!!! Inside or outside in direct sunlight I couldn&#x27;t tell my edges was thin. JUST WOW ! THANK YOU GUYS FOR GIVING ME MY EDGES BACK!</li>
    <li> I am still working with it, but so far this is a great product, will definitely be ordering again. I do wish it came in grey too</li>
    <li> just receive satisfied so far</li>
    <li> Awfull, completly awfull,.I put it over my head and it just make a mass over my head. I do not recomend it</li>
