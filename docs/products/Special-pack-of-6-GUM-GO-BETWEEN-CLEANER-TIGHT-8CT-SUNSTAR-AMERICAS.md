<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. Makes flossing easier and more convenient to carry. Will continue to use this for dental care.</li>
    <li> Best product for keeping the spaces between your teeth and gums clean!  My last visit to my Dentist&#x27;s office for my annual cleaning proved that they work really well!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t feel like I have a fresh mouth if I don&#x27;t use these. curse the day that dental hygientist turned me on to them with her silly &amp;#34;will stimulate gum growth&amp;#34;. whatever. but they do act as a quick floss in my opinion. but just another expense.</li>
    <li> flossing doesn&#x27;t get the gunk out that these do.  Use every night or else.  Good service from this seller.</li>
    <li> Great product and speedy delivery, will definitely order again in the future.</li>
    <li> More. healthy teeth!!</li>
    <li> These do not fit between my teeth. The soft picks do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the &amp;#34;neck&amp;#34; and handle are too flexible so you can&#x27;t control where it goes very well, and the central part of the brush is metal so it injured my gums. :(</li>
    <li> Not any better or worse than others per my husband.</li>
    <li> My son has a permanent retainer on the bottom of his teeth and needs to use these to clean in between instead of floss.  We go through these things like water!  It is great to be able to order them in bulk like this. They came quickly and exactly as described. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I use these and the wider type after flossing my teeth. My dental hygienist is happy when I come in for my cleaning.</li>
    <li> one of the best I used, no more wooden sticks, sharp plastics, hard floss wires.. does the job, will buy more!!</li>
    <li> Great for on-the-go usage when I can&#x27;t brush or floss.  Recommend</li>
    <li> Everyone in the restaurant kitchen has a pack now...lol</li>
    <li> the advertising was incorrect as I received refills not GO BETWEEN CLEANER TIGHT  so I had to return it</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without these! Perfect. What floss won&#x27;t accomplish, these will. I have small teeth and a small mouth so this size is everything i need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no youngster (okay in mind and spirit but that&#x27;s about it at this point in time) and my teeth are showing their age. I keep one of these in the car, at the office, in my pocket. They help me get between the ever-expanding spaces my older choppers are starting to develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like em...I think you will too.</li>
    <li> The dental hygienist recommended these to be a part of my regular dental routine. They work great and I have had no dental problems for over a year. I always reorder because I love the product, delivery is quick and the pricing is good.</li>
    <li> I like them, but they are too expensive to use as I would like to.</li>
    <li> as advertized,  and they work great</li>
    <li> Great, like a pipe cleaner, gets those little guys out from tween your teeth!!</li>
    <li> It does the job but I find it difficult to fit the brush between the teeth, it tends to bend.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful teeth cleaners. My wife and son love them.</li>
    <li> This product helped me to get my first, in a long time, A+ from my hygienist. The only issue I have is that the tip breaks off too easily and I end up going through them quickly. I would like to find a sturdier product.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than floss!  Loved that they have caps for ease of transport and hygiene.</li>
    <li> These are just the best for anytime use. One in each purse, one in the car.  Also beneficial to use before flossing.</li>
    <li> excellent product at a good price</li>
    <li> These work great as I am a first time user of these brushes. They bend a little too easy but can be straightened. If the metal was a bit stiffer it would get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I started to use these go between proxabrushes after my Dentist gave me one to try. I ordered the Tights and they are tight enough to go between my teeth where flossing is difficult. I think they do a better job than Floss. I received exactly what I ordered from the Vendor, 6 packs with 8 brushes in each. They seem to be good for about a week and then the brushes lose their grip and come undone from the handle which is why I ordered 6 packs. Since Amazon seems to be the only place where you can get them I will continue with the Vendor. Dental cleanings have been going much better since I started using them.</li>
    <li> I purchased the cleaner for my dad as he&#x27;s been looking for an upgrade over regular floss. So far he&#x27;s been happy with them. The price was a little cheaper than if purchased locally and the shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Great item that works real well.  Top notch.</li>
    <li> The picture on the page where I placed the order showed the NON-flexy grip. Furthermore, although the description says &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; the brushes I got were in fact &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34;, that is to say very big and completely useless to me.&lt;br /&gt;The only positive aspect of the experience was Amazon&#x27;s customer care, the rep was fast, efficient and very kind in handling the return.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price and shipped promptly</li>
    <li> The refills I had before were shaped as shown in the little picture on the package -- straight like a pipe cleaner.  The new ones are narrow at the point and quickly thicken out.  I don&#x27;t like that -- afterall, I ordered tight because I need the narrower size and the thicker ones are difficult to use in tight spaces -- DUH.  Unfortunately, I purchased enought to last a long time.</li>
    <li> These are the first brushes I have found that are small enough to go between most of my teeth which are very tightly spaced.  So tight, in fact, I don&#x27;t let the hygienist floss between them because she always hits the gum.  As other reviewers said, the neck is flexible but if you hold it where the &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; is, the brush works just fine and doesn&#x27;t bend.</li>
    <li> Product code 872 was the same as previous shipments but product looked different and was packed differently. Called1 888 777 3101 and found out that the former version was discontinued and was replaced with an improved version.  My wife tells me that it is indeed improved.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many interdental tools.  My teeth are very close together, so floss is hard to use.  Sawing it down between the teeth usually shreds the floss, or leaves me with a nasty cut when it finally snaps through to the gum.  Wooden toothpicks and interdental probes tend to splinter, with the obvious dangerous results.  Various plastic toothpick substitutes work better, but if they&#x27;re strong enough to get in, they are often too hard to get the plaque.  So I was very pleased when my good friend &amp;#34;Uncle Ogre&amp;#34; gave me one of these after we&#x27;d eaten my barbecued beef ribs.  The wire core allows enough thrust to get into the gap between teeth and gum, while the soft bristles scrub away the plaque.  I use them once a day, at night, and each one usually lasts several days.  The bristles have an antibacterial coating, so I&#x27;m not jamming a flourishing colony of nasty bugs onto my gums when I reuse a brush.&lt;br /&gt;After 6 months of using these, my regular prophylaxis session is noticeably easier and quicker!&lt;br /&gt;One concern:  dispose of them carefully, with the cover on tightly!  Pets might swallow the used brush and be internally injured by the wire core.</li>
    <li> go betweens are the best way to cut down the time you spend at the detest and the way to cut down you rental bill</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I like the &amp;#34;Tight&amp;#34; Gum Go-Betweens as they will clean in between most any teeth, no matter how close together they are.  Hard to find in my local stores so it is much easier to purchase online, especially since you receive a 6-pack here.</li>
    <li> For those of us with gaps in our gums and crowns, these little brushes work wonders.  Better than using floss.</li>
    <li> Great for gum health. 6 packages of 8 each. These things get stuff that floss can&#x27;t get.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft hence not abrasive, and clean between teeth very well. They can be washed (I use tooth paste) and reused a few times, before the post starts to bend and becomes too hard to use.</li>
    <li> I was assigned go-betweens by my dentist, and being an obedient patient, I gave them a try. Cripes! What a pain! Doing the back teeth, which of course you cannot see, means flying blind and stabbing yourslf multiple times. Gradually i got the hang of the little brushes,and was mortified at all the crud that came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably needed two months to become really proficient with this product, but once my skill set was in place, I felt like a dental saint. No plaque growing on me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clue: Do the teeth during the day, not at bedtime. You are better coodinated, and with the additional natural light, you see better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janet</li>
    <li> These are hard to find, so I was pleased to find them on this site. They fit between most of my teeth--not all.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than in the local super market. Excellent for cleaning between the teeth.</li>
    <li> I think this product is a graded &amp;#34;second&amp;#34;. Not as good as the samples given by the dentist. But on the other hand great price. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use interdental brushes as part of an oral hygiene program and these are just right for what I need.</li>
    <li> Gets out stuff between your teeth that floss doesn&#x27;t.  Love these cleaners.</li>
    <li> Boldly goes where no pick has gone before!</li>
    <li> These little brushes go between teeth, and really clean. My dentist told me to go longer between cleanings, about 9 months, since my teeth were so clean. However, I liked the old go-betweens better; these are not holding up as long as the old ones. I think the wires that hold the little bristles are less sturdy. However, these are the only brushes available now - you can&#x27;t get the old ones. So, this is the best you can get. They are portable, easy to clean, and work extremely well. I like the \\&quot;tight\\&quot; size, it slides between the bases of your teeth easily.</li>
    <li> I uses these at every brushing.  They are easy to use and are an effective tool for removing food bits from between your teeth.  They also seem helpful in reducing plaque buildup.</li>
    <li> These were hard to find locally and they had a new kind which I like much better than what I have been using.</li>
    <li> I have been using these GO-BETWEENS for several years since they do a great job at cleaning between teeth and keeping tartar buildup down between dentist cleanings. Buying them at the supermarket or drug store is very expensive so I jumped at this great deal. Shipping was fast and the product is great.</li>
    <li> Not what I ordered! I got the new kind where the wire is too weak. I wanted these because my store only has the new kind now.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended these some years ago, and I noticed an immediate improvement on the condition of the gums.  I was able to go from having my teeth cleaned from every 4 months to every 6 months.  Well worth the investment.  I use 1 gum brush every week (every night after flossing), and just rinse it off after every use.  So this pack lasts at least 1 month!!!</li>
    <li> Girlfriend told me she needed some of these for her braces so I got on Amazon and BAM...got them for a super good price to.</li>
    <li> These are the best teeth cleaners I have ever used.  They are hard to find in stores.  I didn&#x27;t realize they came in different sizes.  This was the right size for me but there are options for every mouth type.  The price was great and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> I should have paid attention to recent reviews!!&lt;br /&gt;These little cleaners are useless!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so sorry that I bought them. They are not rigid enough and bend too easily making their use next to impossible!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to ask my dentist if he knows of a better product!</li>
    <li> they work great for mr because of my crowns. the regular is very hard to go between.</li>
    <li> The cleaners in the picture are not the same as the cleaners we received. The ones we like have a white cover as shown. The ones we received have a clear cover and the brush has a different firmness than we are used to.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful. I have a couple of deep gum pockets that need to be kept scrupulously clean.  I&#x27;ve used the tight, narrow go-betweens before but they never lasted very long because they would become bent and break off.  Not these babies.  The handle is flexible!  Now I can clean those spaces twice as fast and they no longer bend and break.  But do be extra diligent in keeping them clean since they do last longer now:)</li>
    <li> Good product and it helps to keep food out between teeth that some times toothbrush is not able to do</li>
    <li> easy to use and very effictive</li>
    <li> I have been using the GUM go betweens for years and what was delivered was a different product from GUM. I do not like the new product and will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but not very strong and does not hold up well.&lt;br /&gt;Have had other gum go-between cleaners in the past that were much stronger.</li>
    <li> Great product - it cleans out a frightening amount of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; from between apparently clean teeth.</li>
    <li> After using these for 6 months, the time it takes my hygienist to clean my teeth has been cut in half. These remove plaque from your teeth. Your teeth cleaning time and discomfort will be greatly reduced if you are vigilant using these bottle brushed between your teeth every day.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.  MY TEETH ARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER AND THESE LITTLE CLEANERS JUST ZIP THROUGH&lt;br /&gt;NICE &amp; EASY.  I WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my mom.  She says they are just what she wanted and she had not been able to find them locally.</li>
    <li> These are discreet and effective teeth cleaners. They&#x27;re so easy I use them 2-3 times a day.</li>
    <li> These go-between little bristle brushes to an additional job (beyond floss) to get anything out between the teeth. My dental hygenist recommended these little brushes and they get out some things that floss doesn&#x27;t always get.</li>
    <li> have a gap that floss and regular toothpicks don&#x27;t clean. this does</li>
    <li> I love these cleaners better then any ones I have tried.  My Dentist recommends the brushes.</li>
    <li> I like the new style very much.  With the old style, the brush part bent easily when there was much resistance pushing through between teeth, causing me to have to throw it away.  With this new design, the handle bends first, preserving the brush.  So I find these lasting longer than the old style.</li>
    <li> Same as buying it at the drugstore.  There is no difference.  I did, however,&lt;br /&gt;find the price cheaper than buying it direct from GUM.</li>
    <li> What value!  You get a special 6 pack basically for the price of one or two packs in you local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works great.  Bought these in the store until I found I could order in bulk via Amazon and save money.</li>
    <li> What a bummer! GUM just made a great product into something totally useless for me. The flexible handle makes it impossible to use when you try to reach into teeth in the back of the mouth. Where can I still find the old rigid handle ones?</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and I love it. It is small enough and flexible to get in between teeth and around the gum area. I would definitley buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have a fixed bridge for years, and there were times when I wished I had one of these when I&#x27;m not at home because I had particles stick behind my bridge and wanted to get them out.  I am glad to get these so now I can use them on the go if I have this trouble again. :) They do clean between bridges and dental work well (not implants though per what the instructions on the package says).</li>
    <li> The design of these gum cleaners is good and all of it is well made EXCEPT the metal post.  The third time I use it the post bends and I have to discard.  Why did they put so much quality in every part except the post?  Because of this major flaw, I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I wish I did not need it, but it is superior to flossing. Just as fast and thorough with much less gagging.</li>
    <li> Love, love ,love these</li>
    <li> Too flimsy...not worth it</li>
    <li> Perfect for in-between brushings!</li>
    <li> Great deal on a ton of gum go between teeth cleaners. These are so much stronger and longer lasting than the ones I get from my dentist.  Great tool for keeping the tartar and plague off between the teeth.  I was getting ok dental check ups but now my dentist is amazed at how clean I can keep my teeth.  Keeps asking me when I last had a teeth cleaning.  So this is a great product and value.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years.  They work well to supplement flossing (contrary to what some reviewers have implied, using interdental brushes or other devices is NOT considered a flossing substitute---BOTH procedures plus brushing are the program I follow for good dental hygiene, as advised by my periodontist and by my dentist).</li>
    <li> As usual, exactly what I wanted and delivered on time as promised.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Fast shipping! Wish they were a little cheaper! But I love this product!</li>
    <li> She had been given a couple of these at her last dental visit. So ordered them on Amazon as much, much cheaper than in the stores.  She is happy wife!</li>
    <li> Thin enough to fit the tightest spaces</li>
    <li> As I have aged, my teeth have &amp;#34;drifted&amp;#34;- my dentist&#x27;s term, resulting in large gaps between my back teeth.  The food just packs in the spaces each time I eat.  This is very irritating.  These tiny brushes are exactly what I needed to get it out.  This pack of several lets me keep some at home, some at my office and some in my purse.</li>
    <li> Love these.  They really help me keep the plaque under control.</li>
    <li> Hard to find and I really think this is the best there is.</li>
    <li> I was recently at my dentist for my 6 month check up. He offered me these as samples.  I use the tight ones. This works better than floss, dr toothpicks all rolled into one. Not abrasive. Gets all the food out between teeth.  Has a nice cover to take with you. One lasts from  4 days to a week. Will not be without it. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Have ordered this product before and am very pleased with it.  Great for traveling.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and at a great price</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> So probably you shouldn&#x27;t give up flossing, but these little reuseable, portable, fabulous tools for your teeth will get your dentist thinking you&#x27;re flossing twice a day!  Love them!</li>
    <li> This product has substantially improved my teeth and gum health.  Far surpasses the benefits of dental floss, which I also use in addition.  Service of provider was outstanding!</li>
    <li> These now bend and break with the slightest pressure.  Nowhere as good as they used to be.  Plain toothpicks just as good.</li>
    <li> Best brand of interdental cleaners. The bristles on the Dentek brand actually fell off while using them! GUM brand is stronger and an all around better product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for sometime and they have the small which I need.  The price on this bundle was quite a money saver and I know this is a good dependable product.</li>
    <li> Concerned about a few \\&quot;deeper than we&#x27;d like\\&quot; pockets around my teeth, the hygienist suggested that \\&quot;go-betweens\\&quot; would be most useful. She just didn&#x27;t know where to get them since not all drug stores carried them all the time. I simply assumed Amazon would be the place, and of course, so it is! The product works fine and of course, I love the Amazon prime service. So easy!</li>
    <li> Really good for those of us with teeth tightly together</li>
    <li> Why, oh why do companies insist on fixing something that ain&#x27;t broke.  These used to be fantastic, now the handles are so bendable you cannot get any traction to clean up into the space between your teeth and gums, which was the whole point of buying these; to get a good deep clean and keep you out of the periodontist&#x27;s office.  I am SO disappointed! Anyone have an alternative product suggestion?</li>
    <li> This is a tool to clean between your teeth safely. I recomend it 100%. Forget about the regular wooden toothpick that breaks leaving a piece of wood jammed between your teeth.</li>
    <li> My dental checkups have improved SO much. These aren&#x27;t a complete replacement to flossing, but if you&#x27;re someone who isn&#x27;t adamant about flossing every day, these will really help. They are so much easier than flossing - especially if you have braces. You can use them watching TV etc and really get into hard places that is difficult for floss.</li>
    <li> It will take a while to use all of these, but they work well and seem to do a good job cleaning between the teeth.  It takes a bit to get used to the flex compared to the older ones that were stiffer with more metal, but they feel better in use.</li>
    <li> The item pictured here is what I wanted. However I received proxadent (small brushes). I am trying to use the small brushes but  prefer the in and out. I got confused in trying to complete the amazon form for return and am stuck with the small brushes.</li>
    <li> Good value. fast service.</li>
    <li> this item is a must have!! I have been buying this when I started to use braces, but I will continue using them after they remove them. Oustanding product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, shipping and experience.</li>
    <li> The brushes were a bit big for between my teeth, so didn&#x27;t not work well for me.  I like the idea of the product, just not the right fit.</li>
    <li> Good product. I cannot use dental floss easily. this is easy and it works</li>
    <li> These have got to be the best replacement for toothpicks ever. I shared them with my son as both of us have the same problem of food between the teeth. Also the lid on the little brush keeps it so clean. They can be washed and kept longer also.</li>
    <li> I think these are the best cleaners for between your teeth, they are thin enough and have enough bristles to do a great job.</li>
    <li> wonderful product would not use anything else</li>
    <li> Thanks, your product 6-Gum cleaners is the best !!!!</li>
    <li> I like these better than flossing, but, as others have pointed out, the brush wire bends way too easily. Also, on more than one occasion I&#x27;ve accidentally lacerated/punctured my gums -- the point of the wire is kinda sharp. I showed these to my dentist and he isn&#x27;t a fan. :-(</li>
    <li> Ok, however not worth it.</li>
    <li> Good value for these cleaners.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended I try these. I use one per day so I needed to buy in bulk. These fit between most of my teeth, I have a few spots where I still need to use floss because my teeth a very tight. I wish they&#x27;d make this product with brushes that could be popped into a holder instead of throwing out the whole thing ..seems expensive and wasteful .i still give it 5 stars because they are so easy to use and they really tackle the hard-to-reach areas between teeth.</li>
    <li> I first started buying these at a grocery store but they have about a 200% mark up so I decided to buy the 6 packages and have them with me 24/7, and leave them buy the TV for just doing a cleaning when I feel I need one.  Has really helped on the dental cleanings with lessening the plaque build up.  I would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this product. Just what I need to clean between implants and fillings.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately these are not as good as the older version of the same product.  The wires holding the bristles are much weaker than they were in the earlier version.  The bend and break very easily.  I can seldom get through my teeth without straightening the wire.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use these daily.  Each brush lasts me about 2 days, maybe 3 if I&#x27;m unbearably gentle.  Good multi-pack pricing and quick shipping from this vendor.</li>
    <li> They changed the handles from hard plastic to soft gel. Harder to push thru teeth with. Also they made the wire that the bristles are, much flimsier so it is almost impossible each of these  more than once.</li>
    <li> good product. multiple reorders...</li>
    <li> The best deal on the product.  Delivered on time and as represented.</li>
    <li> This is the exact same product found in retail stores.  The price here is less than what I find these for in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended these.  I brush several times per-day and floss too.  And I think I do a good job.  But, I am constantly amazed to have food particles brought out by the Go Betweens even after a seemingly-through brush and floss.  My check-ups have improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go Betweens are very small and each comes with a cover.  So, you can pop one into your pocket to use after a meal, like a super-charged toothpick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that a Go Between lasts about a week.</li>
