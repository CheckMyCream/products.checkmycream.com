      <li>But this was special.</li>
      <li>Just take special care concerning the heat.</li>
      <li>Very compact and works as advertised and as most of the reviews have mentioned.</li>

      <li>Steams towels very fast.</li>

      <li>My clients love the extra pampering.</li>
      <li>Burned my thumb on my first try, don&#x27;t snicker at the tongs.</li>
      <li>The following reasons were why I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should purchase this item.</li>

      <li>This is a very cheap product and not at all what I expected.</li>
      <li>For those of you claiming it doesn&#x27;t heat the towels very well, you have to saturate them while they are IN the steamer.</li>
      <li>Thanks anyways</li>
      <li>Fast Ship</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only good when steaming all 6 towel, using less causes towels to be too hot.  </li>
      <li>Make sure to put in wet towels, and they will come put steaming!</li>
      <li>I am perfectly satisfied and would recommend this to anyone looking for a simple steamer for general purpose.</li>
      <li>He has sensitive skin and uses the hot towels as a part of his shaving regimen.</li>
      <li>It would help if it could hold a little more water.</li>
      <li>Also, watch out for steam coming out of top, burned myself a few times.</li>
      <li>But so far I have no complaint with them being that I want to travel with this thing.</li>
      <li>I now keep it outside of the room, and bring my client a hot towel toward the end of their session.</li>
      <li>The plastic container that houses the towels during the steam seems a little chincy but for the price i like it just fine.</li>
      <li>Make sure to pre wet the towels before hand or they will never get wet</li>
      <li>I have just used my steamer twice so far.  </li>
      <li>My warrenty offers a Chicago phone number which rings but is never answered.</li>
      <li>No they are not heavy duty.</li>
      <li>I only wish there was a way to turn down the heat a bit, because the towels get very HOT!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t think of any major complaints for this product, however, this is what I needed.</li>
      <li>Other than that, I think this is a great item, and if it ever fails, I will purchase another like it as a replacement.</li>
      <li>The only downside is you have to wet the towels before you put them in if you want them hot AND moist in 15 minutes</li>
      <li>I clean mine thoroughly immediately after every use and prefer to use bottled/distiller water to protect from hard water stains.</li>
      <li>Only reason why i gave it a 4 star out of 5, is because i wish it made a little sound when the timer ended, but thats it a very minor issue.</li>
      <li>I read a complaint that it&#x27;s a pain because you had to clean it and fill it up with water.</li>
      <li>I have used it a few times now, and it does exactly what it advertises.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> For those of you claiming it doesn&#x27;t heat the towels very well, you have to saturate them while they are IN the steamer. Put it on 10-15 mins before you need it &amp; they are nice &amp; HOT but be careful they can get REALLY hot. I had to &amp;#34;hot potato&amp;#34; a few lol&lt;br /&gt;Great product &amp; exceeded my expectations! I recommend!</li>
    <li> Item works, towels are small, this only fits 4 salon size towels. Make sure to pre wet the towels before hand or they will never get wet</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and I absolutely love this product. It is perfect for my needs and very quick, easy and convenient to clean. I clean mine thoroughly immediately after every use and prefer to use bottled/distiller water to protect from hard water stains.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews, I toyed in my mind if I should get it. I never write reviews but I feel like I owe one. The following reasons were why I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should purchase this item. 1. Poor quality. 2. Cleaning/water usage. 3. Size. This product is what it is. It&#x27;s extremely light weight. It&#x27;s a plastic &amp;#34;strainer&amp;#34; for a lack of a better term that sits on top of a &amp;#34;bowl&amp;#34; that you fill with water. It reaches extreme temperature, and comes up through the holes to steam the towels. The lid is also plastic. So you have three pieces that come together. No they are not heavy duty. But so far I have no complaint with them being that I want to travel with this thing. It serves it&#x27;s purpose extremely well. I read a complaint that it&#x27;s a pain because you had to clean it and fill it up with water. I don&#x27;t find this being so strenuous. There&#x27;s not deep crevices that makes this task ever so unbearable. Get a cleaning product, swipe, voila! Get a cup and fill her up! Easy peasy. Another complaint was the size. &amp;#34;I could barely get six towels in&amp;#34; I was in awe when I rolled them up and had room for three more towels and got the lid on perfect. Before I put them in I feel I should mention, I got them wet and wrung them out. They were steamy within minutes. If you purchase this, don&#x27;t expect it to surpass your wildest dreams. It gets the job done extremely well! Burned my thumb on my first try, don&#x27;t snicker at the tongs. Your fingers will thank you. I can&#x27;t think of any major complaints for this product, however, this is what I needed.</li>
    <li> Smaller that I thought.  However it will serve the purpose I purchased it for.  Also good for travelling.  You do have to keep adding water but that is not a problem.  I made the mistake of just taking the top, If you are not going to use immediately, best to add some more water and keep it together so towels will remain hot.  They cool off real fast.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for travel!  The only downside is you have to wet the towels before you put them in if you want them hot AND moist in 15 minutes</li>
    <li> This is great.. However it gets SUPER HOT!! Watch out! Burn baby burn</li>
    <li> Okay, I don&#x27;t write many reviews. But this was special. I order this steamer and it shipped from \\&quot;who-know&#x27;s-where\\&quot; and it took a fair bit of time to arrive. I was dissapointed to see the lid for unit was not in the package after I opened it up. So I contacted Amazon and requested the seller to send me a lid. Now for the good part . . . . . I got a response in my email directly from the seller within 90 minutes of me contacting Amazon. They indicated a lid would be shipped promptly. This was on a Friday. On Monday the lid arrives. So I fire the unit up and it works great ! The towels feel like they came out of a nuclear reactor ! This thing is pretty awesome, it&#x27;s cheap and the customer service through Amazon and the seller was beyond expectations. Get one of these things to pamper yourself, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> returned this item. way too small for my needs</li>
    <li> ...for xmas and he loved it. He has sensitive skin and uses the hot towels as a part of his shaving regimen. I mixed cucumber and eucalyptus wash with the water to give them a clean refreshing feeling and soothe his skin. I also use have used them for facials/masks and just for a quick &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34;. I dont recommend keeping the wet towels in all the time; we just throw a few in at a time when we need them. It heats up very fast. Also, change the water and keep the reservoir clean. I noticed the heating element gets covered in this funky metal looking material and will steam up into the towel. The towels are soft and good quality and the steamer itself is also great quality. The plastic container that houses the towels during the steam seems a little chincy but for the price i like it just fine. The unit is a lot smaller than i thought it would be, which is great, it sits right on the vanity in the bathroom without taking up all the space. I am perfectly satisfied and would recommend this to anyone looking for a simple steamer for general purpose.</li>
    <li> Very compact and works as advertised and as most of the reviews have mentioned. I use mine primarily to soften my morning beard in preparation for shaving and, indeed, it works beautifully. If you dampen the towel and wring it out, you&#x27;ll get a faster heat up. I have never had to wait more than ten minutes, tops and even then I have to wait for some cooling to take effect after spreading the towel over the top with the forceps. Just take special care concerning the heat. You can end up with a bandage around your hand in less than a second if you&#x27;re not careful (personal experience!). Make good use of the forceps.</li>
    <li> Got this for my sister who&#x27;s a massage therapist. She travels to her clients a lot and LOVES this towel steamer.</li>
    <li> I only wish there was a way to turn down the heat a bit, because the towels get very HOT! Other than that, I think this is a great item, and if it ever fails, I will purchase another like it as a replacement.</li>
    <li> This is a cute little steamer that works great.  You do have to watch the water level if leaving it on for extended periods.</li>
    <li> This works great!  I have used it a few times now, and it does exactly what it advertises. Make sure to put in wet towels, and they will come put steaming!</li>
    <li> Fairly simple steamer but works great. Towels are nice and it is exactly what I was expecting. Only reason why i gave it a 4 star out of 5, is because i wish it made a little sound when the timer ended, but thats it a very minor issue.</li>
    <li> wet the towels prior to using them, let them simmer a minute or 15 and you&#x27;ll be scalding your client if you&#x27;re not careful. Works well for someone who doesn&#x27;t use a lot of towels in a day.</li>
    <li> Heater gets the shaving clothes very hot if you damp them a bit. Essentially the same design as a vegetable steamer, would go that way if I had to do it again.</li>
    <li> I would not order this product it is very cheaply manufactured and the seller is not ethical. There is no heat control which causes burns.</li>
    <li> This steamer fits just about anywhere. Steams towels very fast. Hold 5 + hand towels!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband! He is a barber, and uses the hot towel on his clients! He LOVES this! He says that it works great and the tongs make it very easy to handle! He is able to warm about (5) small towels in here at once! Arrived the very next day to the salon, and he&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hear up all the towels with one streaming. Kinda disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this towel steamer! I find it works best when I fill up the water reservoir as the directions state, then put WET towels in the towel holder. They get piping hot! This is easy to use, easy to fill, easy to clean. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the slight &amp;#34;ticking&amp;#34; noise from the timer. I planned to use this in my small massage room, but the ticking sound is slightly distracting. I now keep it outside of the room, and bring my client a hot towel toward the end of their session.</li>
    <li> My husband and I were talking about Christmas presents. He said it would be nice to have hot towels like they used to have in barber shops. Not to be out done, I thought I would get my iPad out and see if I could find anything. There it was, Amazon had it! Amazon has everything! He was really surprised and happy to get it. He spent about an hour checking it out and reading booklet. It made his birthday!</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap product and not at all what I expected. Its essential a plastic bowl on top of a burner. I returned it immediately</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed...Its a big bother to return it so its just another gadget in my bathroom! Thanks anyways</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised! Be sure to dampen the towels first and you will be rewarded with steaming hot towel. Do not forget to use the tongs which are provided to remove the towels. I have had the best hot towel shave to date thanks to this little device, love it!</li>
    <li> The product is flimsy and its makers are elusive. I received the steamer in late April band only used it fout times before it failed to function. However what was even worse was to discovery that the maker of the unit vanishes after the sale. My warrenty offers a Chicago phone number which rings but is never answered. Out of curiosity I called repeatedly, all different hours but no answer and no answering machine. I went to the Beauty Pro where they list a toll free number for customer inquiry. This time a message comes on, acknowledging Beauty Pro but stating that they will be away until May 30th and will review customer calls when they return. Hardly the way one expects a merchant to operate. The BBB will hear from me. Joe Carbone</li>
    <li> Fast Ship Very Nice ,Thanks</li>
    <li> Love this item. Very good to use with skin treatments.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only good when steaming all 6 towel, using less causes towels to be too hot.  Also, watch out for steam coming out of top, burned myself a few times.</li>
    <li> I have just used my steamer twice so far.  I like the small size so I can travel with it to people&#x27;s homes when I do reflexology.  Pre-moistening the washcloths does help.  My clients love the extra pampering. It would help if it could hold a little more water.</li>
