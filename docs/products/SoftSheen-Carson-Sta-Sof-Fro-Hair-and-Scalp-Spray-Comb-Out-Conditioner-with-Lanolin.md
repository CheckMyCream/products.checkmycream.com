    <li> This product works well but has too much perfume.  I bought it for my 10-year-old son and he refuses to use it. I would not want that much scent either, but some might not mind.  It is otherwise a very good product, better than a lot of the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Great hair moisturizer.  I have very thick and dry hair, this gives excellent shine and smoothing results.</li>
    <li> Nice and soft..easy to comb!!!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Too much can cause build up.  But my hair loves it.  It makes my hair soft especially in braids.</li>
    <li> The only problem was the cap was broken.</li>
    <li> This keeps my hair soft which reduces damage and breakage to my hair. It&#x27;s an old favorite that I intend to keep on my list of must haves. The price here may be a bit higher than a retail store but the convenience of having it delivered balances using gas and energy to go to an outlet.</li>
    <li> I am alarmed how horribly this product smells!  I don&#x27;t know if it works well or not, I (or my family!) can&#x27;t get over the musky smell.</li>
    <li> The only spray leave in that has made my hair soft,actually works,&amp; last for my natural hair.Back 2 the basics.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, use if when my hair is braided because I know it will really moisturize my hair.</li>
    <li> It is really an effective product!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written on Amazon and I&#x27;ve bought hundreds of products here. I picked up this product by chance on a clearance rack at Walgreens just looking for a spray conditioner that was inexpensive. I didn&#x27;t even realize when I bought it it was intended for African American hair. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well my curly hair responded after using this (along with my normal curly products) My curls were tighter and more defined than ever! I absolutely love this product and will recommend it to all my curly girl friends. You do have to experiment with the amount your hair can handle or it will look oily. It didn&#x27;t work well on my daughters hair which is only slightly wavy, but I know I sprayed too much. This product will have a permanent home in my bathroom as long as I live!</li>
    <li> Great. Been using for over 30 years. It actually makes your hair softer and therefore less likely to break. .</li>
    <li> This is a great product that leaves your hair silky soft and manageable. No oily build up at all. It&#x27;s so good, I told my Caucasian and my Latino friends about this quality product after they complained about struggling with dry scalp.  Just spray a small amount in your palm, rub it together and massage it vigorously into your head.  Style your hair the way you like and you&#x27;re ready to seize your day.  It lasts a long time as well.</li>
    <li> Gives hair that sheen...</li>
    <li> for me this product goes back to the 60s for the afros. I used to purchase them at wallgreens, but one never knows when they might stop stocking them.</li>
    <li> This is an original product we used from the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s and it works. it keeps you hair moist and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. It&#x27;s light and can be used several times throughout the day if need. I&#x27;ve been natural  for over a year and have tried many products. After spending a lot of money and time I thought to myself &amp;#34; my hair was natural long and healthy when I was a child, what did my mom use back then&amp;#34;? Sta-Sof-Fro Afro Sheen and coconut oil came to mind so the search was on and Amazon had it yeay! The ingredients are natural and good for your hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used for black hair. It really softens the hair and makes it very manageable especially during the combing process. I have used this product since the 80&#x27;s and there is nothing like it. All you need to do is spray a little on the hair, rub it in, comb it out, and you&#x27;re done. It stays in for many days after application and it keeps your hair very soft soft. It can be also used to prevent the hair from drying out and splitting at the ends. Don&#x27;t put too much on or else your hair will become too oily. All you need is just maybe 3 sprays and you&#x27;re set. This helped my fro&#x27;s maintain a nice healthy and soft texture. I sear by this product. If you wear your hair in braids, this product will be a relief from an itchy dry scalp also. I use this product with a K cutter comb or the black fist natural afro comb.....Just keepin&#x27; it real ya&#x27;ll....</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have two different textures. My hair is curly, wavy, kinky and hers is course. This product works well for both of us. It softens your hair more than what God gave you. I have her use it twice a day where I would use it every few days. I highly recommend this for natural hair. Who knew what a product from my youth would still be as relevant today. (I am singing the Hey hey Hey Hey...what&#x27;s the matter with your afro it wont grow, into a natural. rhyme now).</li>
    <li> Started wearing my hair in it&#x27;s &#x27;natural&#x27; state several years ago. I tried many different products, but kept going back to this tried and true product that my Dad used. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this old classic.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product great service</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for years, and he loves it.  His hair feels really dry after it&#x27;s washed, but when he applies this product It immediately soften his hair, controls it,  yet dosen&#x27;t leave his hair feeling oily or wet.</li>
    <li> Used it for years.  Love it!</li>
