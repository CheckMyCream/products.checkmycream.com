      <li>I love the fact that it has wheels and can be moved anywhere in the house.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> wonderful hair dryer and at a good price</li>
    <li> It falls over because too top heavy.</li>
    <li> I used it twice and I love it.</li>
    <li> It arrived about 5 days after ordering and I&#x27;m writing this review after using it 5 or 6 times so far.  Setup was a breeze.  I actually put it together while watching a video.  And trust me, I&#x27;m allergic to tools - they make me break out in frustration.  I NEVER attempt to put anything together if I hear the rattle of screws in the delivery box. :)  I usually hand it over to someone... my son, my husband.  But, when it arrived I was home alone, and was so anxious to use it that I dared to put it together myself.  And it was a breeze (despite the limited instructions which was just pictures).  If I can do it, anyone can! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love how quiet it is! Wow! And it dries WAaaay faster than that counter top dryer I had.  I have very rarely used hair dryers but recently changed the way I style my hair.  I&#x27;m African American with shoulder length natural curly hair spending WAY too much time on styling then discovered a quicker wash-and-go style which prompted me to get a dryer.  It works!  Super fast in-shower styling and super fast drying!  Love it! (oh, and for my sista naturalistas, just search for &amp;#34;TRUE Wash &amp; Go Styling for Kinkier Hair Types | Hair Rules&amp;#34; on YouTube for that quicker in-shower wash and go method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it dries so evenly all around my head.  No wet/damp spots like with a counter-top dryer.  I keep the setting on 60 and that works fast enough for me.  But I like that you can run it at a very low or cool temp as well if you prefer no heat.  When drying, I like that it seems to cycle through heat then cooler while drying.  Not sure why it does that but hey, it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, that daggone bell is LOUD when it shuts off.  I forget that every time I use it.  Startles me all the time. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it is indeed top heavy so be careful when moving it around or it could topple over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  Give it a minute or two to warm up to the temperature you set it at.  It blows cool for a little bit.I usually turn it on about 3-5 mins before I need to get under it so it&#x27;s ready when I&#x27;m ready.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer.  It heats like a professional dryer.  The only con is that the wheels don&#x27;t roll that well and you have to hold the bonnet when moving it to prevent it from toping over.</li>
    <li> It is sturdy and works as described.</li>
    <li> Yes, the dryer is top heavy, so you need to hold the head when your moving it about, which I find is not an issue for me. I&#x27;ve used the dryer twice since I bought it, it works perfectly, I had to put it on 60 for an hour, cause anything higher was too hot. It&#x27;s very quiet and easily adjustable to the heights you require. I bought this dryer to cut down the costs of going to the hair salon for a wash n dry, since both my daughter n myself have weaves in for the summer. I also bought a padded folding chair, so I can use the dryer anywhere in my apartment.</li>
    <li> I Purchased this for my mom on Mothers day and she Loves it! she tells me something everyday about it hehe her hair drys up in 20 mins !&lt;br /&gt;she has no issues! she completely loves it!</li>
    <li> it is almost impossible to assemble but the dryer itself works well.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good dryer. My only complain is that when you move it from place to place, it almost fell on the floor if you don&#x27;t hold it very tide. It has not stability</li>
    <li> My wife really LOVES this dryer. It was easy to put together and works Great. It dries her long hair just the way she likes it. She&#x27;s Happy.. I&#x27;m Happy.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this dryer because I was tired of paying a lot to do my hair. I&#x27;m Dominican and have a lot of curly long hair. This dryer was perfect, it is really big so even with my head full of big rolos I was able to fit. I put it on the highest temperature and it really is hot, which I like because it dries it fast. My hair came out really smooth and shiny. I think for the price is worth it, plus it got to my house extremely quick in 1 business day.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best thing I&#x27;ve ever brought on Amazon and I&#x27;ve brought a lot of stuff. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is because it takes a little longer to dry my hair than the salon but I will take that extra 30 mins saving $60 a week going to the salon. I have Malaysian hair sew in, I usually go to the salon every week for a roller wrap or some wand curls but I will never ever go back to the salon again unless I&#x27;m going for a sew in. My curls come out so bouncy and pretty. I look like I just stepped out of a salon. The dryer was easy to assemble and it&#x27;s better being in the comfort of my own home</li>
    <li> The instruction paper is comes with says it has a wind speed selector but it really doesnt</li>
    <li> I waited 6 mos to write this review because I wanted to be sure it atleast lasted that long. This thing is perfect for home use. I use it on myself and my daughter. roller sets come out perfect. twistouts dry in half the time wash and go&#x27;s have less shrinkage because the gel cast sets faster. I&#x27;m so glad i ordered this product. It is top heavy when you try and roll it I support the bottom and top as I push but it mainly stays in one spot. The bell can be a bit startling but mainly because you tune out the sound of the dryer so when the timer goes off you&#x27;ve forgotten what you were doing. i dont find it necessary to crank the heat all the way up, at mid range my hair is dry in about 40min. In Short... I love this dryer and if anything happened to it I would gladly purchase again. I ordered my dryer the week of Christmas it was on my doorstep the next day</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is everything I hoped it would be.  It is simple to use and does the job.  I have my hair professionally colored and highlighted.  I have used blow dryers, hot curling irons and hot rollers for many years but the curl and body I get from hair rollers and this dryer is way better and stays curly longer.  My hair actually feels like it did when I was younger.  My only complaint is the dryer came with a broken clip that holds one wheel (of the stand) on and no instruction booklet for use.  I would like to have these things, if possible.</li>
    <li> Nice, sturdy good quality.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet but plugged it in and waited a while for it to get hot but had to turn it off before it actually produced real heat.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer, especially if you have long hair. It runs so smooth and light i can actually watch TV while drying my hair and not have to max the volume. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer for my girlfriend for her birthday last year because she is always complaining about getting her hair done and how much people charge her (which I end up paying for anyway) so I thought what better thing to buy her for her birthday than something she can use and benefit from forever. She loves this hair dryer, she puts her hair in rollers and sits under. It gets very hot too! Thanks for the great buy!</li>
    <li> Too big and too heavy. So the top is wobbly</li>
    <li> I love this dryer.  I purchased about 3 weeks ago and have used it almost every other day since I bought it.  It dries extremely fast in the morning so it allows me to not have to blow dry which is essential with African American hair and relaxers to prevent dryness. The settings are great and It is super quiet which is what I was looking for.  Those are all definite positives.  However, I would have to agree with one of the other reviewers.  It is extremely top heavy and I had the same problem in that yesterday it fell over and the visor in the front broke.  Now I am hoping I can find someone that replaces the part as the part is screwed in and if that is the case then this would possibly increase my score a little but you still have the problem of it falling over in the future.  If I cannot find a part to replace it online then I would drop this review to a 2 or 1 since it doesn&#x27;t work as well without the visor keeping the heat in.</li>
    <li> Just got this delivered today, fast service. Put it together, but the directions and picture show a power on/off switch, mine doesn&#x27;t have one, and instead of Fahrenheit it is Celsius. The dryer goes on when you set the timer. The picture on the box also shows a on/off button. Other than turning it on, I haven&#x27;t used it. Tomorrow I will try it out.</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing a hair dryer instead of a hand held one. I really like this product, dries hair fast and I can sit comfortably while waiting....the downfall is not being able to hear the television while hair is drying, however it gives me time to check out magazines or read a book while waiting. It is big, so I store it in my closet, luckily I have a walk-in.</li>
    <li> Dries our thick African American hair quickly ( I have 3 teen age girls). Like being able to adjust the temperature. Like the mobility.</li>
    <li> Dries in half the time of the portable dryer I&#x27;ve been using for the past two and a half years. The timer is new for me and I am so grateful for it! The adjustable neck is awesome bc my clients are of different heights and the wheels are an added convenience. It&#x27;s a great dryer and I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It was easy to put together too!</li>
    <li> Love it. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The dryer is working fine so far. There&#x27;s no question that it is top heavy and the bottom part is more flimsy than I would like. I move it around with care and support it with both hands. For the price I expected to be so. In the future, if I adapt to it, I might fiddle with the design and make it more stable. Do not expect wonders.</li>
    <li> Great Dryer! Gets very hot. Very little assembly. If you have DIY hairstyles this dryer is perfect.</li>
    <li> My wife liked it after they sent the necessary parts to assemble the hood. It may be a bit noisy but, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get. I&#x27;ve been wanting one for a very long time. I am very satisfied with my new hair dyer.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that responds well to a hood-style dryer, and before now, the only time I had access to one was at the salon.  I set this unit up this morning before work (took about 10 minutes).  The results were great - just like the salon!  Other reviewers mentioned the high heat, so I set the temp in the middle range, and it was perfect.  This dryer is a great unit for the price!</li>
    <li> This product is better than the dryers at the Beauty Salon - I have long hair and, even with a roller set, my hair was perfectly dried in less than an hour.  I love the fact that it has wheels and can be moved anywhere in the house. This dryer is a Blessing and if anyone is looking for an inexpensive hair dryer this is a good choice, with it&#x27;s quick warm up feature and definitely gets the job done with ease!</li>
    <li> Great product, it&#x27;s so quiet!!! I own a salon and it&#x27;s weird not to have to talk over the dryer!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works as well as in the salon..dries hair in less time, large hair rollers fit comfortably under the bonnet..quick,fast and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The reason I bought this dryer was because I wanted to stop wasting my money going to the salon and just do my hair myself. I have African American, relaxed hair with a black color rinse. I set out on a hair journey to use all the products and tools my stylist uses on my hair so I could just do my hair myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me talk about the shipping. I live in Orlando, Florida. I purchased the dryer around 11am on a Thursday and received it the very next day (Friday) around 4pm. Not sure if Mix warehouse is located near me, but I was so pleased with the speedy delivery. Now I originally wanted to purchase this dryer in black but there was only one left and I have this fear about buying the last of an item because I think it has the potential to be defective. So I decided to go with the dryer in white because it got overall better reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting it together is very easy. I will say that it came with only one sheet of instructions and they were very vague. But using the pictures and your common sense you can figure out what goes where. The dryer is fairly tall and the hood is very large. I have a peanut size head but someone with a larger head can definitely fit comfortably under it. I&#x27;m short (5ft 1in) and it adjusts perfectly to my height so that I can sit in my chair comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls for temperature are in Celsius but thats not really an issue because there is blue, yellow, and red coloring indicating cool, medium and hot. There is also a timer which sounds like a timer used for baking. It&#x27;s fairly loud when you are under the dryer. It made me jump in my chair the first time it went off. The dryer is extremely quiet as well. My favorite part about the dryer is that it is low in wattage.  Its only 1000 watts. A conventional microwave is about 1200-1300 watts and most people use that everyday. So the dryer is very cost effective compared to some of these dryers being sold with 2000+ watts. The dryer also gets very hot. I normally use it on 60 degrees Celsius which is the first hot setting and it is goes up to 75 degrees Celsius.  Overall, I am very pleased with this dryer. It is worth the investment and will save you alot of time and money making trips to the salon.</li>
    <li> Love it! Dries my locs in 50 minutes fully. The stand is a little tilted the higher up it goes but I&#x27;m not that tall so lowering it isn&#x27;t a problem. It&#x27;s quiet with just some ticking in between.</li>
    <li> totally enhanced my natural hair journey!!</li>
    <li> It works great! The dial for timing it&#x27;s backwards but it works just fine.</li>
    <li> So far so good!! I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks now and it&#x27;s still working good. Blowing really hot. Quick dry time.</li>
    <li> I have used the dryer several times and it works great.  I had questions which were answered promptly by other customers which was helpful in making my decision.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good buy for the price my only complaint is the timer is also the power knob.  When the dryer is on it ticks the entire time which gets annoying after awhile especially that one of the awesome feature is the dryer itself is very quiet.</li>
    <li> need a stool or low back chair to use, stand does not go high enough and needs to be offset a little in order to lower over head without touching the chair.</li>
    <li> Very good over all!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this great pick up buy this people</li>
    <li> Great dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I have natural hair and needed something that would provide a set that I could once only achieve in the salon.  Found it!!!&lt;br /&gt; One of the reviewers warned of the timer going off.  She was right (tee hee), startled me.&lt;br /&gt;Great product though once I found the right chair to sit for 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Gives me the set I need with out having to go to the salon.  Used it four to six times now with a book in my lap, too cool.&lt;br /&gt;You may want to drape a towel around your neck, as the dry will heat up, but I like it warm.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this dryer very often but when I have it has thoroughly dried my hair.  It gets very hot.</li>
    <li> This dryer  was  pretty  much as I expected  it  to  be : I&#x27;m a hairdresser &amp; I have  this  type  of  dryer  in my  salon. I was  purchasing this  one for a nursing home because  theirs  had worn  out.  This  type  is good  for  that  situation because  that age of client  often  has stooping posture and/or is in a wheelchair.  The  only one  that  would  be better  is the wall-Mount  variety.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer  arrived  in good  time  ane in good  condition. The quietness is great!</li>
    <li> This item it&#x27;s been working perfectly fine, I&#x27;m glad i ordered!!</li>
    <li> I have very curly, color treated hair that gets too curly and frizzy when dried with a diffuser. This dryer is perfect to dry my hair and do deep conditioning treatments. I usually let my hair air dry, which can take 2 hours! With the dryer, I put it on cool for about 25-30 minutes while I return emails, and I&#x27;m good to go! I like the ability to roll it around as well as the temp and timer dials. Shipping was very fast! I&#x27;ve used it about 3 times per week for a couple of weeks, and so far so good!</li>
    <li> Plenty room in hood.  It is not to loud.  Like that I can adjust the temperature and use the cool air.&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair and the air speed and the temperature do not dry my hair out like normal hair dryers.</li>
    <li> - Its great for roller sets on my curly 3B long hair! 45 minutes &amp; my hair is straight! I just have to touch up the roots with a flat iron because my hair is curly. No biggie. I only use this like 3-5 times a year to prevent heat damage but I&#x27;m saving more money using this than a salon visit! Smart investment. I use it watching Netflix. [&#x3D;</li>
    <li> It drys fast, good timer and temp control but it is Not sturdy, it tilts everytime I use it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a Christmas present for my daughter.  Needless to say she hasn&#x27;t used it yet as she hasn&#x27;t received.  I will update my comment after she utilize the dryer. I will say I received the dryer in a timely matter.  The smaller package was a little torn and retaped. Hopefully, all the pieces are here. 5 stars for timeliness.</li>
    <li> I Like the hairdryer but feel the stand could be made of stronger material for better stabilization and  the shield that drops down over front of face is a bit&lt;br /&gt;uncomfortable.  Regardless, the hair dryer does a good job and am happy with it overall.</li>
    <li> It made my wife very pleased.</li>
    <li> I put this dryer on my wishlist and it was purchased for me by my husband. It gets very hot, just like the ones in the salons. The temp. is adjustable and the motor runs without creating a lot of excess noise. I like that the hood is extra large and adjustable.Great color combination too. The instructions on how to put the unit together could be a bit more clear, but are not totally confusing and shouldn&#x27;t keep anyone from purchasing the drying.</li>
    <li> My Wife loved this, See shows it off every chance she gets. Warning though, it can get very hot. Seems very solid. It&#x27;s a bit tipsy, instructions suggest placing a sand bag around base, I would say thats a good idea.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this thing, she said It feels like a real saloon.</li>
    <li> quick delivery, great product, thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to use, light and attractive.</li>
    <li> It was a far better product than I anticipated for the money. It arrived earlier than I was told and I was pleasantly surprised by the quietness of the motor. I am able to watch TV movies while drying my hair. I have NEVER been able to do that with any other hair dryer that I have ever owned!!  Better quality, arrived sooner than expected and more quiet, how can you beat that?? Thanks!!!  IS ALL GOOD!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s missing a screw to put this together :-( Besides that.....I received it on time; it&#x27;s the right size, and the price was excellent.......</li>
    <li> top heavy so hard to move around but warms up quickly.  gets really hot so u don&#x27;t have to put the setting high</li>
    <li> Very good. Fast shipping and works awesome!</li>
    <li> I just turned it on and the temperature is cool no matter what setting I turn it to. Also I do not have a button or anything to change the wind speed. What am I doing wrong?</li>
    <li> Awesome dryer, gets hot. Dries my thick hair. Assembly is not difficult, but you do have to figure out how to work the two pieces (the dryer is separate from the stand). Made well and I think this will last.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I ordered this item around 12AM and and was surprised to see that the seller had already shipped by 9AM(LIGHTENING FAST SHIPPING) AND RECEIVED 2DAYS EARLIER THAN ESTIMATED ARRIVAL...WOOOW! I&#x27;ve used it 4 times (hair treatments and drying),daughter and I must say we&#x27;re African American with THICK COARSE HAIR, other dryers even at the beauty shop took 1hr 1/2 to dry.THIS DRYER TOOK ONLY 25 MIN.on 60/DEGREES(HOT ENOUGH TO COVER YOUR EAR S0 IMAGINE THE HIGHER SETTINGS(up to 165-degrees Fahrenheit temperature control is adjustable AS IN PRODUCT DESCRIPTION** \\&quot;I HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED YET\\&quot;)MUST SAY EACH TIME OUR HAIR RESULTS IS SILKY, BOUNCY AND FRIZZ FREE, LOVED THE CONSTANT COOL DOWN THEN TEMPERATURE INCREASES BACK,FEATURE WHILE DRYING,THE TIMER MAKES YOU JUMP, VERY EASY TO ASSEMBLE,OVERALL EXTREMELY PLEASED!!! \\&quot; WILL UPDATE IN FUTURE.</li>
    <li> Get the job done but just don&#x27;t fell right.</li>
    <li> Great item, my wife and daughter are pretty happy, timer is great.  No flaws that i can see. I will post in the future how is it working.</li>
    <li> works like the dryers in the salon. its a must have</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading another reviewer say it cut the time she needed to spend under the dryer drying her roller set in half.  I have a professional belvedere that normally takes 1 hr 45 minutes to dry my roller set.  This dried my hair in 1hr 5 minutes.  The hottest setting was too hot for me, and I was worried that 1000 watts wouldn&#x27;t be hot enough!  I did need to put socks over my ears, because the dryer is so hot and if I could stand the hottest setting my hair would probably dry in 45 minutes.</li>
    <li> It dries well and is easy to put together and roll around.  I was hoping to use it more but I don&#x27;t like the noise the timer makes.</li>
    <li> Definitely more convenient thatn going to a salon all the time. I love doing my own hair at home now and this has allowed me to spend less time blow drying and styling it.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long hair that takes over an hour to dry, I bought this product so I could save some time by working on my laptop while my hair is drying.. I am pleased with it so far. It&#x27;s very quiet and adjustable. I haven&#x27;t figured out a way for it to dry the underneath back part of my hair but it honestly takes less than 5 minutes to blow dry after sitting under this for a cycle. The only con, is the storage aspect obviously. It&#x27;s big but the height can be adjusted to make it a little smaller. It&#x27;s very portable and durable.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer for personal use at home. It works well to dry my naturally curly hair. It&#x27;s like air drying but a lot faster. I will also use it to do deep conditioning treatments or process colors. The down sides are the large bonnet and it being top heavy and needs both hands to maneuver. The other odd thing is that when using the dryer a small clump of hair gets pulled up to the screen. At first I thought this was going to be a problem, but it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It&#x27;s perfect.  It actually works and does what it says it will.  Accurate temps and a wide range of temps.  Very adjustable.  Only slight downside is it requires a strong hand to screw in stuff when setting up otherwise it&#x27;s wobbly.</li>
    <li> it is quiet, face guard is claustrophobic! base is really large, top heavy, do not expect pole to last, would NOT purchase again!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the hair dryer so far. It works perfectly. My hair gets dry quickly and it is so easy to use. I mostly bought this hair dryer for my daughters. They have longer hair and it costs me so much money and time to bring them to the salon. So now I have my own salon at home. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I am sorry i thought i left a comment on amazon. However, i brought this for my wife and she loves it. She feels that she does not have to now go to the hairdresser for treatments when she can do them at home herself. Thanks Guys. HAPPY WIFE HAPPY LIFE!</li>
    <li> My wife does hair and her old dryer went out. Saw these and bought 2. OMG clients do NOT sit under the dryer long at all. Will be buying another one soon.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times but so far I love it. It heats up and works as good as the one in the beauty shop that I go to. I just hope it will last a long time. I would give it a 5 star if I had it longer than I have.</li>
    <li> Yes, it shoots out air from unheated to way too hot for me. Yes it is on an adjustable stand. But here is why I do not recommend this dryer: the way the fan is housed in the top, pulls my hair up into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my stylist does my hair, she sits me under the hood dryer for a while, then finishes with her blow dryer. This is much healthier for the hair than straight blow dryer and is actually faster. I wanted to replicate this at home, but could not afford the real professional dryer, so I settled for this. I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried it with curlers, my biggest ones will not fit under the hood. Too late to send back. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is the best hooded dryer I have ever owned!!! I will be buying another one so my daughter can have her own at her place.</li>
    <li> Very top heavy, be ready to catch it when you try and move it...it WILL fall over. Mine did and broke the visor. It&#x27;s pretty much useless now. Hard to adjust the height and tough to position it so you can actually get under the damn thing. Save your money and buy the chair-style.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and this dries my hair in 45 minutes.  With my other hair dryer it took me 1 1/2 hours.</li>
    <li> This Pro Bonnet Style Dryer shipped fast from the seller and was easy to assemble.  It is whisper quiet and does a great job drying hair evenly.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The instructions for assembling this item were not good.  Obviously written in Chinese or Japanese then poorly translated.  However, my husband did eventually get the item assembled and I have used it only once.  However, I am happy with it.  It is quiet and efficient and dried my hair raidly.  At this point I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have 4a/b natural hair and I don&#x27;t like to use direct heat (blow dryer/flat iron) on it very often. I ordered the dryer because I often don&#x27;t have the time to wait around for my hair to air dry after washing/conditioning and styling. This dryer is great. It was easy to assemble and seems to be durable. The tempature and timer settings work well. It get&#x27;s the job done!</li>
    <li> I love love love this hair dryer....wash my hair seat for 30 min Nd I&#x27;m done...</li>
    <li> This no name hair dryer was delivered earlier than expected.  Setup wasn&#x27;t difficult.   The temp control is an awesome for  sensitive scalp.      SEPT. 30, 2014 UPDATE:   For the first 30 days, hold onto your box.  This isn&#x27;t an Amazon item so if you need to send it back anytime thereafter, you will have to pay 1) return shipping and 2) $25.00 restocking fee.  Also, the head on this dryer is not very deep or extremely wide to accommodate a lot of rollers  Therefore, it will be uncomfortable trying to dry your hair with limited movement.  Unfortunately, I must sell this because I prefer to set my hair bi-weekly or at least monthly.  Any taker&#x27;s?  Mint cond.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer!!!! Am so glad I purchased it :)</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recently showed me how to get my wavy hair to be a bit more curly by finger-styling my hair and then sitting under a hood dryer.  I purchased this hair dryer and it worked faster and better than the salon dryer!  I sit under it for about 4 minutes and my hair is dry enough to hold whatever style I give it.  I have a lot of hair so having it dry this quickly is terrific.  How nice it will be to have dry hair every morning this winter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service was fast and the packaging was appropriate.  A totally positive experience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really works well the only problem is the stand not very sturdy</li>
    <li> I used this dryer for the first time yesterday and I really like the salon quality results.  I am African American and like to roller set my hair.  I was using a collapsible bonnet dryer and the heat was not distributing evenly so some of my hair would be dry and some of it would still be damp when I took out the rollers.  I also didn&#x27;t like having to sit the dryer on top off my table since collapsible dryers are table top units.  I purchased this dryer so I could sit more comfortably since I have to be under it for a while ( my hair is only shoulder length but it is very thick so takes  1 1/2 hours to dry).  The dryer was sorta difficult to set up because the holes to enter the screws to attach the wheels were stripped on the unit I received so I ended up needing a wrench to tighten and a few of them are still a little loose.  The bonnet is very top heavy so when I placed it on top of the pole it leans, so it cant stand on its own so when I roll it from my bedroom closet to my living room I have to hold the top so it doesn&#x27;t fall over.  I use it at a table so I can sit in a chair and it leans against the chair behind me when I use it so the fact that it cant stand on its own is ok for actual use.  Some things to note: its surprisingly quiet (so you can hear the tv without blasting the volume), because part of the hood is see through I can actually watch television while under the dryer, and it has a timer which I like so I don&#x27;t have to keep track of how long I&#x27;ve been under it myself.  I didn&#x27;t watch television I actually worked at a table on my laptop and it was so comfortable the time just flew by. The heat distributes evenly and my hair turned out great.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is extremely easy to use.  The only flaw is that it blows harder on one side.  I have to clip the hair down.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this hair dryer! i cant believe i waited so long to buy one. great for roller sets ( my 2 1/2&amp;#34; rollers are almost too big- they barely fit , i think a 2&amp;#34; roller would be more comfortable) and deep conditioning treatment, i do one almost everytime i shampoo now its that easy. it is large and raising and lowering the bonnet is not easy but it only takes about 15 minutes for my hair to dry with a roller set at the setting on 60, you cant beat that! no more tugging and pulling on my fragile bleached hair to blow dry it ( which takes me about a half a hour) i just sit and relax for 15 minutes and then touch the set up with a flat iron. i would buy this over again in a heart beat!</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks but it is working very good.  It seems pretty sturdy.  It is a little top heavy so you have to be careful moving it.  Also because of the design it doesn&#x27;t not angle down quite as my as I would like which forces me to lean back in my chair a little.  It is quiet except for the timer.  It provides plenty of heat I usually have to lower the temperature after a few minutes.  It was easy to put together.  Overall I am pretty satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> It was damaged when received. Now I have to pay to return it.</li>
    <li> Arrived soooo fast made me very happy!!!!!! and the dryer it self is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy that I purchased this hair dryer!  I have lots of fine hair and it dries my hair in about 30-35 minutes.  It does get pretty hot so I suggest a setting around 50 – 55.  It’s very top heavy so heed the directions and secure it somehow.  I do have to say, the first thing my husband said when he saw it was “are you going to the moon?” – as it does look like a space helmet.  The directions are not very clear but I managed to put it together just fine by myself and it’s very sturdy.  I definitely would recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> Great dryer... Easy to assemble, heats up quick, heat is adjustable, mobile, works like a charm... No complaints!</li>
    <li> Works perfect and is not loud at all.</li>
    <li> Large hood on this dryer. My husband assembled it, it had many pieces to put together. Dries quickly, but has a loud ticker and bell to signal when turning off. Works well drying my curly hair. Doesn&#x27;t seen to cool down quickly when set to cool cycle. The dyer was delivered earlier then promised, which was very nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3-4 times now and it dries quite quickly. I have hair; locs down the middle of my back and I like that the bonnet is large so that my entire head dries. I tend to either braid or curl my locs and it takes forever to dry them when I set them. But I can sit under this dryer for an huor or less and my hair is fully dry.  I did not give a 5 because one of the casters arrived broken. I haven&#x27;t had time to make a claim with the company and I probably won&#x27;t because it&#x27;s such a pain in the neck. I just chose not to insert the wheels.</li>
    <li> okay so i just recieved my dryer today and i am super excited. i want to do my hair tomorrow but i have one concern the picture of the fan  in the middle of the dryer on the head piece . is it suppose to do anything when you push it?</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer!! I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed once we got these together.  Although they are advertised as having adjustable wind speed, they do not.  There is simply nothing where the diagram says the wind speed button should be.  We ordered three of these and they are all this way.  Good looking dryer, but will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Although this dryer is powerful enough to dry your hair quickly, it is incredibly top-heavy! The first one I bought fell over and cracked the visor, making it completely useless. I purchased a second one thinking perhaps I&#x27;d just put it together incorrectly. Sadly, at this point it&#x27;s clear the problem is a design flaw. When I&#x27;m not sitting under it, I&#x27;m going to have to take the hood off of the stand in order to avoid having a second broken dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
</ol>
