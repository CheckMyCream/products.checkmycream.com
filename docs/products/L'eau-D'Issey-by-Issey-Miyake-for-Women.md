    <li> Bought this for the wife, she loves Issey !  Great price and great and fast shipping, will probably buy this again from here !  Thank You Amazon !</li>
    <li> It smells so pretty, I pick up lilac and some other soft flowers. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last long or maybe I just don&#x27;t notice&lt;br /&gt;that it&#x27;s there. Anyway its very nice and pretty big bottle. Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> excellent perfume love it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as she used to wear it all the time and had trouble finding it anymore.  I LOVE the way it smells on her.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne I have been wearing it for years. I normally buy it at  perfumeforless for about $80 but amazon has it for $45 what a bargain! if you buy this cologne you will get lots of compliments</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite for years!</li>
    <li> It is not the original. Really disappointed.</li>

    <li> Amazing!! Everywhere I go people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing!</li>
    <li> Great price. Have been waring this fragrance for years and receive many compliments.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne with a purse sized container &amp; I love it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite!  Has been for years!</li>
    <li> Smells like it should!</li>
    <li> This is my Signature scent. When people smell your Signature scent, you want them to remember you.</li>
    <li> Great, my wife (and I)  love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome love the smell</li>
    <li> Same great fragrance I remember. The last couple of years, I have been trying out other smells. Saw this at the store and it was $86+ for 2.3 ounces, a little spend so decided to look on Amazon. For $30+ less and bigger bottle, I bought it. Was delivered on time and right when I was done getting ready and ready for the &amp;#34;spritz&amp;#34; of the day.</li>
    <li> It seems to be original</li>
    <li> If you like a light floral scent this is for you.</li>
    <li> Great smell and the pkg was delivered fast and well pkg</li>
    <li> Product just as described and shopped fast!</li>
    <li> Other Fragrances I liked:&lt;br /&gt;La Perouse - Gilly Hicks&lt;br /&gt;Light Blue: Islands: Dreaming in Portofino - Dolce &amp; Gabbana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of those are discontinued.  This one smells very nice.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the original Issey Miyake, but a bad imitation. Do not buy!!  I have been using Issey for over 10 years and the perfume in this bottle does not smell the same at all and does not last very long. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to get a refund..I&#x27;m surprised that Amazon selling this junk.</li>
    <li> Great price!  Wife loves it!</li>
    <li> First of all my bottle was not full .... I would guess my first 20-30 Sprays were missing... Not worth the money per the amount I was sent .</li>
    <li> Very please with the service and product, all lived up to their excellent  expectation will use them again.  F.fronsdal</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all good, the wife liked&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Eau De Issey</li>
    <li> So happy that this was the correct fragrance that I wanted to buy- I&#x27;ve read where some people got a fake or one that had extra alcohol- this one was up to par.</li>
    <li> Love the Fragrance . HAPPY with the seller .Thank you</li>
    <li> Just what I thought it would be</li>
    <li> The best smelling perfume ever - I get so many compliments and people asking me what I am wearing</li>
    <li> Smells like cheap deoderizer....</li>
    <li> Barbara&#x27;s Favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> I bougth this item for my girlfriend and she smell amzing. The fragance is durable. 10 points!</li>
    <li> This was originally bought as a gift for another family member,  my wife decided to keep it for herself. It looks like the real thing, we can tell no difference in packaging from the store bought perfume and this. That being said, we really don&#x27;t know what the store bought stuff smells like. Either way we are happy with the purchase for the money.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume and always easy to find on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I am loving this perfume. Smell fantastic and is authentic. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great cologne. Shipped fast</li>
    <li> Purchased fragrance for Christmas gift, Close but no cigar. It&#x27;s not the real Issey Mikaye perfume</li>
    <li> Great value totally satisfied</li>
    <li> The full and true description of the item and delivery  was very fast. It’s a pleasure to deal with you (great communication). Thanks a lot! I will purchase more.</li>
    <li> The product appeared to be the same as I had purchased in the past from Macy&#x27;s; however, I do not think that the scent remains as long as it previously did, so I think that you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> After all these years...still love this scent. Arrived as expected, glad to have it.</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent for over ten years. The product I received is NOT ISSEY Miyake for women.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Just as I expected.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE!!! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This is not real one which is I used before.</li>
    <li> I got it for my wife for valentines day,so loves it!!! And she smells amazing, not to mention it was at a great deal!!!!</li>
    <li> I loved  this perfume</li>
    <li> Love love love the smell! Dainty yet sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;One minus is that it does not last so long.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when I wear this</li>
    <li> I love this scent - it is mild and slightly floral.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using l&#x27;eau de Issey by Issey Miyake for years now and the ORIGINAL FRAGRANCE is absolutely beautiful, and will always be my favorite. BUT this particular version is NOT THE ORIGINAL FRAGRANCE! IT SEEMS TO BE AN IMMATATION OF LEAU DE ISSEY. This particular fragrance or should I say, stench, is far from the real thing. More like a cheap drugstore parfum, overbarering alcohol fumes is all that comes out of this product. Its worth the small price difference to go with a department store  on this one.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this amazing fragrance and love the quality, packaging and price of this purchase!</li>
    <li> Just perfect As expected</li>
    <li> Love, love this perfume and receive many compliments on how good it smells.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Totally met my requirements and rec&#x27;d the product in 2 days.</li>
    <li> No original, this it is a fake!!! The worst is that you can&#x27;t return this item.</li>
    <li> Issey Miyake has been my perfume for the past decade. It is the only one I use and I get complimented on it ALL THE TIME. I mean ALL THE TIME! I&#x27;m grateful it works with my body chemistry. It is truly a beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> Very pleased, just as described will do business again</li>
    <li> **UPDATE** I wrote review below before actually receiving product since I already knew how much I loved this perfume. I opened my delivery this evening and sadly my bottle was cracked and most of the perfume had leaked out. I sent the supplier an email requesting replacement or refund. I expected to have to ship back cracked bottle before receiving refund, if they would even refund me at all. To my surprise I received notification less than 5 hours later (on a Sunday evening) that my refund had been issued. What an OUTSTANDING company dedicated to CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I will be placing my order for replacement bottle of this to die for fragrance ASAP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100 stars in my opinion! Have used this fragrance for about 15 years. I have tried different perfumes but always return back to Issey. I get compliments EVERY time I wear this scent without fail. I catch myself smelling my sweater or wrists throughout the day when I wear it because I cannot get enough of it. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly light, but fresh and welcoming.</li>
    <li> I was quite disappointed and really believe I got a weak imitation.  There was almost no scent and it lasted only a brief time.  Do not buy this product!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Was worried it would be knock off, but smells true, and last long</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!!! Came safe and sound it bubble wrapping.  The perfume smells great and is almost half the cost at the department store!!!</li>
    <li> Great delivery and price.</li>
    <li> Great seller, great product</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume. Unlike other perfumes, it stays with me all day. I try others and always go back to L&#x27;eau De Issey. I haven&#x27;t found it in any store under $95. Great deal here!</li>
    <li> Siempre me ha encantado!</li>
    <li> Pleased with product and savings.</li>
    <li> love this and price was great</li>
    <li> Ok i read the reviews on this i also no that this mess is watered down its not real smells more like alcohol then perfume amazon should be ashamed of this mess im done buy at your own risk people👎👎👎</li>
    <li> This is my signature cologne and the price was what I pay for at the Helen Brett Jewelry Show that comes to&lt;br /&gt;New Orleans three times a year.  That&#x27;s the only other place that I can get that price.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love Issey Miyake. A great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so angry with this bottle, it leaks, and it was a waste of money. It&#x27;s like I threw money in a garbage can. My fiancée was so let down, and I got so embarrassed. Amazon took care of me and refunded me, and it&#x27;s for that reason that I gave 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Clean scent..long lasting.</li>
    <li> Purchased for birthday gift, very happy with the purchase...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite since 1997...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like freshwater with a perfect fragrance. ..</li>
    <li> The real deal. Great price here compared to most stores. My wife loves this flavored water.</li>
    <li> This is the worst fake.  I have been wearing this scent for 15 years and this is a horrible fake.  This bottle smelled like rubbing alcohol.  I also brought it to Sephora and compared the writing and ingredients and it was a horrible copy. Amazon quickly refunded me.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite smell. I took it to Sephora to check for authenticity and it was authentic. My only concern was that the bottle was not filled fully, it was missing about one ounce. Also the scent does not last forever.</li>
    <li> Fast service great product and price.</li>
    <li> Large bottle and the best price.</li>
    <li> Nice product and service!</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance, and this is a good price!</li>
    <li> good price and a great perfume - always complimented on the scent.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your prompt shipment!  This will be a Christmas gift I am excited to give.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes! Long lasting and vey distinctive-- I always get a compliment when I wear it...</li>
    <li> Excellent,  I&#x27;m very happy,  thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Excelente,  estoy muy feliz,  gracias... Pura vida 👍</li>
