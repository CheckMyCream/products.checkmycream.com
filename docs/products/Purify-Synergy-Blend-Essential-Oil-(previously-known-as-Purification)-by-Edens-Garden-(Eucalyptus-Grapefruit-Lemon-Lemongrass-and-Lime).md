      <li>Smells amazing and neutralizes everything.</li>
      <li>Smells really nice.</li>
      <li>:) Smells good and does the job.</li>
      <li>What kind of purification does the product offer?</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to test it yet, but it makes a really nice deodorizer.</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t that one of the reasons why most us use fragrances in our bedrooms?</li>
      <li>and I love using it for cleaning and diffusing.</li>
      <li>I love the citrus smell.</li>
      <li>Sometimes, it&#x27;s not just safe to believe the claims on the varieties of aromatherapy products on the market.</li>
      <li>Love it, smells just like some pricey brands, but a much better price.</li>
      <li>Love the aroma so refreshing for the house in a burner or a spray bottle, thank you,will buy again,love it</li>
      <li>I do more like 4 or 5 drops in my oil diffuser.</li>
      <li>(among other things) I find this brand perfect for it!</li>
      <li>This smells so clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Just love the scent, makes everything smell clean but not flowery.  </li>
      <li>Strong, great essential oil!</li>
      <li>My hubby purchased this product in a set with Joy Synergy Blend Essential Oil.</li>
      <li>By the way, looking at the constituents of this product, I would have believed that its primary work should have been in the area of skin care.</li>
      <li>I think aromatherapy has advanced beyond what I could explain.</li>
      <li>Really, with the good scent it has, like any other sweet-smelling substance, I feel good about it.</li>
      <li>I have had to use almost 3x as many drops and still doesn&#x27;t linger like pure essentials</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good that the constituents are mentioned in the description, and the product brochure as well reveals 101 ways to use essential oils.</li>
      <li>I diffuse it in my office to keep it fresh.</li>
      <li>Based on my findings to prove the essence of the natural ingredients, I found out that eucalyptus is a strong ingredient in the blend.</li>
      <li>love my essential oils!!</li>
      <li>Lime juice can be used to clear the skin from skin infections so as to have a smooth skin.</li>
      <li>Love all the essential oils I purchase from this seller.</li>
      <li>Sweet scents touche the brain and clear mind.</li>
      <li>So, I can&#x27;t really figure out how this oil blend works to address some strain in the mind and of course the body.</li>
      <li>As a layperson with limited knowledge in aromatherapy, I would say that it does speak well to conclude in agreement with the product maker that this purification synergy blend essential oil plays a great role inensuring some emotional well-being.</li>
      <li>I live in Thailand and there&#x27;s a company called HARN selling this exact same stuff for almost $90 a bottle.  </li>
      <li>Typically, products like this blend oil shouldn&#x27;t pose any danger to the body, most especially the lungs and the brain.</li>
      <li>They are 100% natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>Never put an essential oil directly on your skin, because they&#x27;re too concentrated and will sensitize you.</li>
      <li>As a housewife who is busy with household chores on a daily basis, I&#x27;m just beginning to appreciate the value of the product.</li>
      <li>Smells good but very weak scent!</li>

    <li> Strong, great essential oil! Delighted with it. :) Smells good and does the job. What else can I say?</li>
    <li> I love this oil,it has a wonderful aroma and I love using it for cleaning and diffusing. It is an exceptional value.</li>
    <li> Love it, smells just like some pricey brands, but a much better price.</li>
    <li> wonderful to diffuse.</li>
    <li> I love using Purification in my Laundry routine! (among other things) I find this brand perfect for it!</li>
    <li> Smells good but very weak scent!</li>
    <li> Just love the scent, makes everything smell clean but not flowery.  Use it all the time to mask a wet dog smell in the house.  Also mix with some water and spray in the house for a freshener and if I do not have time to bathe my dogs.</li>
    <li> I would rather call this purification synergy blend essential oil as mind purifier.  My hubby purchased this product in a set with Joy Synergy Blend Essential Oil. Of course, both of them serve me well. By the way, looking at the constituents of this product, I would have believed that its primary work should have been in the area of skin care. I know lime as an anti-oxidant and as a cleansing substance. Lime juice can be used to clear the skin from skin infections so as to have a smooth skin. I think aromatherapy has advanced beyond what I could explain. So, I can&#x27;t really figure out how this oil blend works to address some strain in the mind and of course the body. Sometimes, it&#x27;s not just safe to believe the claims on the varieties of aromatherapy products on the market. It&#x27;s good that the constituents are mentioned in the description, and the product brochure as well reveals 101 ways to use essential oils. Based on my findings to prove the essence of the natural ingredients, I found out that eucalyptus is a strong ingredient in the blend. I don&#x27;t know if it was made to work like &#x27;menthol&#x27; which gives good breath and clears the throat. The description states that it is meant to give some purification feelings. That however is not detailed. What kind of purification does the product offer? Really, with the good scent it has, like any other sweet-smelling substance, I feel good about it. Isn&#x27;t that one of the reasons why most us use fragrances in our bedrooms? Just to feel the way we want to feel...I can&#x27;t express that in words. It&#x27;s a bit psychological. It all depends on individual&#x27;s response to scents. Typically, products like this blend oil shouldn&#x27;t pose any danger to the body, most especially the lungs and the brain. They are 100% natural ingredients. As a layperson with limited knowledge in aromatherapy, I would say that it does speak well to conclude in agreement with the product maker that this purification synergy blend essential oil plays a great role inensuring some emotional well-being. Sweet scents touche the brain and clear mind. My hubby, who ordered for it few weeks ago, said it eases the mind from strain after a day&#x27;s work.

    <li> Love the aroma so refreshing for the house in a burner or a spray bottle, thank you,will buy again,love it</li>
    <li> just what I needed, worked great</li>
    <li> This Is my second order of Purification.</li>
    <li> I love the smell! However, it seems with only with three drops the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long. I do more like 4 or 5 drops in my oil diffuser.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and neutralizes everything.</li>
    <li> Smells great. I diffuse it in my office to keep it fresh.</li>
    <li> I like this brand for the other oils but this one did not freshen my house like its more expensive counterpart. I have had to use almost 3x as many drops and still doesn&#x27;t linger like pure essentials does</li>
    <li> love my essential oils!!</li>
    <li> Love their service and products!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I use Edens Garden oils all of the time.  Purification is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I love the citrus smell. It provides a pleasant smell to the bug-fighting potion I put together.</li>
    <li> I live in Thailand and there&#x27;s a company called HARN selling this exact same stuff for almost $90 a bottle.  Smells great!</li>
    <li> Good item for the price i am very satisfied with the quality of the product.  Very good deal for the money.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet, but smells great.</li>
    <li> I am an essential oil addict.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s also a great bug repellant. Never put an essential oil directly on your skin, because they&#x27;re too concentrated and will sensitize you. Just miss it with a little water or carrier oil, and spray away.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice. I bought this to add to water to use as a mosquito repellent. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to test it yet, but it makes a really nice deodorizer.</li>
    <li> This smells so clean and refreshing. It is my go to blend to use in my ultrasonic diffuser on cleaning days or days were I could use a &amp;#34;perk&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s consistency is a bit on the runny side but it is perfect for diffusers!</li>
    <li> Love all the essential oils I purchase from this seller.</li>
