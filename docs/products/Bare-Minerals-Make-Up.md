      <li>It gives my face the look of warm sun against my skin and looks so healthy.</li>
      <li>I love warmth and have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>I love the product, and I&#x27;ve used it for a number of years.</li>
      <li>This Bare Escentuals i.d. &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; mineral powder is great for a nice tan look.</li>
      <li>Gently distribute it in the contouring areas with the Application Brush before blending it out and it will not overwhelm those with fair  complexions.</li>
      <li>It is also great when used to define such areas as your cheekbones or nose.</li>
      <li>Using a little at a time like this makes it look natural and flawless.</li>
      <li>Love this brand of bronzer little bit goes a long way great pigment</li>
      <li>Got exactly what I wanted and it arrived super fast.</li>
      <li>I use this as a gentle blush on top of my Bare Escentuals powder foundation.</li>
      <li>Getting this product on line was so much easier than traipsing to the mall.</li>
      <li>All you need is a few sprinkles in the cap, swirl it lightly into the brush and contour away!</li>
      <li>Plus I was able to get a smaller sized for half the price at the mall.</li>
      <li>Since a little bit of this product goes a long way for me, I was extremely pleased.</li>
      <li>I am a rather pale individual normally, but this really gives my face color.</li>
      <li>The size is small but that&#x27;s not a big deal since you really should only be using a sprinkle or two, if that much.</li>

    <li> I love the product, and I&#x27;ve used it for a number of years. However, I didn&#x27;t realize how tiny this one would be. I think it&#x27;s very expensive for the amount of product you get.</li>
    <li> The size was much  smaller than I  expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered before....just what I wanted</li>
    <li> smaller than expected</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I wanted and it arrived super fast. Good seller. Ty. Flo.</li>
    <li> Love this brand of bronzer little bit goes a long way great pigment</li>
    <li> This Bare Escentuals i.d. &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; mineral powder is great for a nice tan look. It is a bit darker than I expected but I use this sparingly on my cheeks, forehead and chin. I am a rather pale individual normally, but this really gives my face color. It is also great when used to define such areas as your cheekbones or nose. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.</li>
    <li> Good color for tan/brown skinned gals</li>
    <li> Everything was very nice</li>
    <li> My favorite and great price</li>

    <li> This all over color is great. The size is small but that&#x27;s not a big deal since you really should only be using a sprinkle or two, if that much. Gently distribute it in the contouring areas with the Application Brush before blending it out and it will not overwhelm those with fair  complexions. Don&#x27;t fear the warmth lol There are great tutorials on youtube etc.</li>
    <li> Getting this product on line was so much easier than traipsing to the mall. Plus I was able to get a smaller sized for half the price at the mall. Since a little bit of this product goes a long way for me, I was extremely pleased. It arrived two days after it was ordered as promised, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I use this as a gentle blush on top of my Bare Escentuals powder foundation. A little goes a long way, and it looks very natural. I don&#x27;t like to look made up and this does the trick.</li>
    <li> awesome natural bronzer without the orange looking coverage</li>
    <li> This was purchased to be a part of a future gift.  I do know that the person it will go to is very pleased with this product so I&#x27;m assuming that opinion will continue.</li>
    <li> Warmth is a great product for every season of make-up wear.  I wear it in the summer and winter and it blends nicely no matter my skin shade.</li>
    <li> I like the product but the price for what you get in the product is ridiculous.  It is less than a &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; size.  If I had known how &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; of the product I was getting I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.  Seriously, for &amp;#62;$9, this is not a serious order, this is a &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; of an order.  Won&#x27;t buy it again. They cheapened the container as well.  The product is good people but it&#x27;s not that good.</li>
    <li> this is a sample size and the description is misleading - buyer beware.</li>
    <li> A little goes a LONG way with this stuff. I had the same size pot for probably 4 years before it ran out. All you need is a few sprinkles in the cap, swirl it lightly into the brush and contour away! Using a little at a time like this makes it look natural and flawless.</li>
