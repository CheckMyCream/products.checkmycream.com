      <li>nothing but awesome compliments by women.  </li>
      <li>This one is legendary for its longevity - and it lives up to that reputation.  </li>

      <li>Excellent gourmand -</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!!!  </li>
      <li>It does well with persons with severe allergies, and the price was awesome.  </li>
      <li>Even then it might be best to wait for a couple of hours for it to settle some.</li>
      <li>&gt; Perfect</li>
      <li>Great Service and item</li>
      <li>i got my package in four days and in great condisioun.  </li>
      <li>LOL.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a very, very warm fragrance.</li>
      <li>but it smells amazing!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m good.  </li>
      <li>And then I remembered how much I loved it after running out</li>
      <li>My son in law is very pleased with Angel.</li>
      <li>Fragrance is very nice and refreshing.</li>
      <li>this is very good, but if you dont like sweet smells,its not for you.</li>
      <li>This cologne is amazing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s that amazing.  </li>
      <li>Heck, it almost feels warm when you spray it on.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the kind of fragrance that should be worn out on the town or in a club setting.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Purchase from A&#x27;s Market Place ( LMAO I should have known better!!!)&lt;br /&gt;1x</li>
      <li>/&gt;Purchase from A&#x27;s Market Place ( LMAO I should have known better!!!)&lt;br /&gt;1x</li>
      <li>Smells nice.</li>
      <li>Angel Men is a very very strong &amp;#34;gourmand&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>very easy to od on this cologne</li>
      <li>if you can handle and get threw the first 30 minutes of this you&#x27;ll have a very nice caramel, chocolate, vanilla, honey, coffe masterpiece of a fragrance.</li>
      <li>it may just get you more attention</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, the reason I felt like I had to review this is because it is among the best colognes I&#x27;ve ever run across, and the bottle only cost me $30 or so.  </li>
      <li>So, what they do is take the registrations and ID off of the box package, and many times remove serial numbers from the bottles, then reseal the package.</li>
      <li>ok though&lt;</li>
      <li>such an awesome smelling cologne.  </li>
      <li>the product code is ripped off the inside top?</li>
      <li>Glad the gentlemen have one too.</li>
      <li>it guys, and chicks love it</li>
      <li>I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Simply the best fragrance a man can wear!  </li>
      <li>, so I bought more in 2009.  </li>
      <li>ok though&lt;</li>
      <li>but after about 30 minutes it turns into a brand new amazing fragrance!</li>
      <li>Live Jazz --&gt; good</li>
      <li>Live Jazz --&gt; good</li>
      <li>I personally do not like how it smells on me for about the first 45 minutes, after that it is wonderful.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t strong, but rather light and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>But once the fragrance begins to settle a bit, it is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Best to wear in the cooler months, as it is too heavy for summertime use.</li>
      <li>The first 30 minutes or so can be overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>and she said that her husband originally received it as a gift</li>
      <li>He loves it.. and people get a kick out of it when we both smell similar but in our own gender way!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The reason for the Don&#x27;t buy, is I don&#x27;t want to many people out there wearing it...  ;)</li>
      <li>but I think this one is slightly better due to its superior longevity.  </li>
      <li>Sweet fragrance that smells like baked goods.  </li>
      <li>I have gotten comments from several women telling me I smell GOOD, and wondering what I was wearing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The decanter that it comes in is really nice, but still maintains a masculine appearance.</li>
      <li>He has always used another popular brand of mens cologne for a long time, but now I think I will be buying more.</li>
      <li>and this is beautiful cologne not for little boys</li>
      <li>This is totally worth</li>
      <li>Heavy vanilla and tar notes give it a very &#x27;warm&#x27; scent.  </li>
      <li>I agree with most of the other reviewers, this is some strong stuff.  </li>
      <li>I think if everyone wore it properly it would be all love for A*Men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s asinine policy of sending out bottles of it that aren&#x27;t good enough to be sold elsewhere lost it a star, but overall, I think the purchase was still worth it, and I won&#x27;t be returning it.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I gave this for Christmas present to my father and he is so in love with that perfume.</li>
      <li>and you should only spray 3 times at the most.</li>
      <li>We are not blind.....</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t pretend to be able to identify every note present, but it reminds me of holiday baking--pumpkin pie and the like.  </li>
      <li>this does not smell the same, but is very light, sweet and masculine</li>
      <li>others have said, it lasts forever (I burn through most colognes in 3-5 hours, this one is still there after 8+), and is very rich and complex.  </li>
      <li>Whatever images or feelings that conjures up for you may be positive, but not so for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Gouramand scents are generally not my favorite, but if you like this style, this is certainly a good choice.  </li>
      <li>I have pure coffee and pure malt and ice man</li>
      <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t smell like dark temptation It does smell similar and has a very nice chocolate smell.  </li>
      <li>A very well done fake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase</li>
      <li>people are paying for â€œnew&amp;#34; products and are not recieving the whole package they are paying for.</li>
      <li>I had no idea how this scent may resinate with him, but he&#x27;s always remarking to me how much he loves the scent of Angel that I wear, so I ordered it for him.</li>
      <li>I ran straight out and bought it that day, which I never do.  </li>
      <li>A very well done fake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase</li>
      <li>Play Intense (tar, vanilla, coffee notes),</li>
      <li>then I get a free bottle after several purchases.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely different and unique.</li>
      <li>I wear it more often than any of my other colognes and get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
      <li>This is fine with me, inasmuch as the scent is intact (smells just like the one at the department store), but I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll remain that way.  </li>
      <li>Only makes sense right?!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not edgy enough to go out at night in, but good none the less.</li>
      <li>scent last for several hours and smells better as the day goes on.</li>
      <li>The box can many times show you signs if you suspect the product to be factory second or grey market.</li>
      <li>This is my new go-to for winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After my first 5 minute date the girl said \\&quot; I don&#x27;t know what you said in the last 5 minutes because all I can think about is licking that scent off your body.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance, but hard to pump</li>
      <li>I think it smells better than dark temptation!!!</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;package\\&quot; came and my husband sprayeda little on him for the first time, and since then, he has raved!!</li>
      <li>This was purchased directly from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I wear this scent myself, and I don&#x27;t think it is too masculine.  </li>
      <li>The registration code was removed, even though it was bought directly from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Purchases Directly from Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;2x A*Men --&gt;</li>
      <li>I sprayed some on my wrist (too much looking back on it) and the smell lingered, even after showering nightly for 3 days</li>
      <li>Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the fragrance, but hard to pump</li>
    <li> 5* while worn in winter I would give it 1* for summer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very, very warm fragrance. Not to be worn yearly. I prefer when the weather is 25 degrees or lower. This is when you will get the complements. I personally do not like how it smells on me for about the first 45 minutes, after that it is wonderful. 1 spray on neck and 1 wrist (touch together, not rub), and that is all for me&lt;br /&gt;This is known as a love / hate fragrance. I think if everyone wore it properly it would be all love for A*Men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit*&lt;br /&gt;I realized that the box I received has had the registration code removed from the inside of the box. Grey market? This was purchased directly from Amazon. 5* still (the frag itself is 5* and Amazon CSR taking care of the situation 5*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------Past Fragrance Purchases-------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchase online, I take it to the department store to test out. ALWAYS do this, and do not throw the box away instantly. The box can many times show you signs if you suspect the product to be factory second or grey market. Factory second refers to a fragrance that the manufacturer has not sold yet, and has deemed to be \\&quot;to old to sell\\&quot;. So, what they do is take the registrations and ID off of the box package, and many times remove serial numbers from the bottles, then reseal the package. These will never make it to a department store, but they seem to make their way to Amazon. Amazon then sells them as \\&quot;New\\&quot;. IMO, if the package has been opened, and the contents altered, these are no longer \\&quot;NEW\\&quot;. Also since they are \\&quot;OLD\\&quot;, more than likely they are stale or they will not last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchases Directly from Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;2x A*Men --&gt; Both factory second, registration codes cut from box. Stale and weak&lt;br /&gt;1x Terre d&#x27;Hermes --&gt; Factory second, ID etched off of bottle. Stale and weak&lt;br /&gt;1x Cartier Roadster --&gt; ID cut from box (suspected factory second) smells ok though&lt;br /&gt;1x Le Male --&gt; good&lt;br /&gt;1x Live Jazz --&gt; good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase from A&#x27;s Market Place ( LMAO I should have known better!!!)&lt;br /&gt;1x Gucci Guilty --&gt; A very well done fake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase from Purfumania:&lt;br /&gt;1x La Nuit --&gt; Perfecty second) smells ok though&lt;br /&gt;1x Le Male --&gt; good&lt;br /&gt;1x Live Jazz --&gt; good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase from A&#x27;s Market Place ( LMAO I should have known better!!!)&lt;br /&gt;1x Gucci Guilty --&gt; A very well done fake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase from Purfumania:&lt;br /&gt;1x La Nuit --&gt; Perfect</li>
    <li> Excellent gourmand - if that&#x27;s your thing.  This one is legendary for its longevity - and it lives up to that reputation.  Will last all day.  The opening is quite harsh, but it settles down quite nicely.  I find this similar to Givinchy Play Intense (tar, vanilla, coffee notes), but I think this one is slightly better due to its superior longevity.  Some people think it has a burnt (chocolate, tar, rubber, etc...) scent, but I think that is a common complaint of all colognes of this class, and I find it just has that burnt sensation for the 1st 30 min or so.  This cologne is not really for everyone - it&#x27;s one of those \\&quot;love it or hate it\\&quot; scents - but I have received many compliments while wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gouramand scents are generally not my favorite, but if you like this style, this is certainly a good choice.  Best to wear in the cooler months, as it is too heavy for summertime use. Just be careful - a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> One of the greatest scents of all time at a great value! I wear it more often than any of my other colognes and get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I decided to take a leap of faith and purchase this \\&quot;Angel for Men\\&quot; for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day. I had no idea how this scent may resinate with him, but he&#x27;s always remarking to me how much he loves the scent of Angel that I wear, so I ordered it for him. The \\&quot;package\\&quot; came and my husband sprayeda little on him for the first time, and since then, he has raved!! He has always used another popular brand of mens cologne for a long time, but now I think I will be buying more. It isn&#x27;t strong, but rather light and not overpowering. It has such a heavenly scent. The decanter that it comes in is really nice, but still maintains a masculine appearance. Very Nice!!!</li>
    <li> Sweet fragrance that smells like baked goods.  Long lasting due to the tar notes.  Something Casual i&#x27;d wear during the daytime.  It&#x27;s not edgy enough to go out at night in, but good none the less.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!  I have gotten comments from several women telling me I smell GOOD, and wondering what I was wearing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the Don&#x27;t buy, is I don&#x27;t want to many people out there wearing it...  ;)</li>
    <li> i was a little nervous about buying cologne over the internet. i got my package in four days and in great condisioun.  this was a complete blind buy but it smells amazing! the initial 30 minutes of this fragrance is less than desirable thanks to the harsh tar note. but after about 30 minutes it turns into a brand new amazing fragrance! but be careful this is strictly a fall/winter fragrance and you should only spray 3 times at the most. if you can handle and get threw the first 30 minutes of this you&#x27;ll have a very nice caramel, chocolate, vanilla, honey, coffe masterpiece of a fragrance. i will definitly be getting another bottle once i run out.</li>
    <li> this is very good, but if you dont like sweet smells,its not for you. it projects a lot and lasts very long, if you spray it too much, it can get very annoying</li>
    <li> Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaattttttttt thats all i can say very beautiful I have pure coffee and pure malt and ice man and this is beautiful cologne not for little boys</li>
    <li> Been using Amen for quite a while always bought the glass bottles. I didn&#x27;t like the rubber bottle, sprayer didn&#x27;t work well. I won&#x27;t buy rubber bottles again plus fragrance wasn&#x27;t very strong smelled weak.</li>
    <li> Came on time, also came with small travel bag and shampoo that i did not know was included. You can put 1-3 sprays of this cologne on and it will last for about 24 hours! Don&#x27;t over spray, would buy again when a run out.</li>
    <li> In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angel Perfume reeks of chocolate-scented bathroom air freshener &amp; some kind of orthopedic shoe powder with a Godforsaken undercurrent of nursing home pastries.  Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma...</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cologne that smelled similar to axe dark temptation.  Based on other reviews, I decided to go with A*Men instead of other scents.  Although it doesn&#x27;t smell like dark temptation It does smell similar and has a very nice chocolate smell.  I think it smells better than dark temptation!!!..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I do not like about this cologne though is the button is a little hard to push due to the style of bottle they decided to go with.  This is only a minor complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent last for several hours and smells better as the day goes on.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other person who reviewed it and said it&#x27;s extremely different.  This cologne is amazing.  I wear this scent myself, and I don&#x27;t think it is too masculine.  I actually smelled it on another woman back in 2004 and she said that her husband originally received it as a gift but she preferred it for herself.  I ran straight out and bought it that day, which I never do.  And then I remembered how much I loved it after running out, so I bought more in 2009.  It&#x27;s that amazing.  I think most people either love or hate the scent but it&#x27;s definitely different and unique.</li>
    <li> such an awesome smelling cologne.  let me tell you. nothing but awesome compliments by women.  I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Angel Men is a very very strong &amp;#34;gourmand&amp;#34; fragrance. It&#x27;s without a doubt the longest lasting cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn. I sprayed some on my wrist (too much looking back on it) and the smell lingered, even after showering nightly for 3 days I could still smell it on my wrist.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to od on this cologne, so I recommend spraying some in the air and then walking through the mist. Even then it might be best to wait for a couple of hours for it to settle some. Believe me, too much can be sickening...as bad as BO.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend wearing it to work unless you wear very little. It&#x27;s the kind of fragrance that should be worn out on the town or in a club setting.</li>
    <li> It was just what we wanted.  I have worn Angel for women for years.  Glad the gentlemen have one too.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. I lov it. Last really long. Exactly what I needed. I recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> someone opened the box and pealed off the serial numbers. I add those numbers to the Thierry Mugler website then I get a free bottle after several purchases.</li>
    <li> I only like one cologne so far, unforgivable! this does not smell the same, but is very light, sweet and masculine and I happen to like it. hate the strong men&#x27;s cologne smell!</li>
    <li> I gave this for Christmas present to my father and he is so in love with that perfume. .thanks. .</li>
    <li> I had been wasting time with scents made by people who make clothes.  Save yourself the trouble--buy a scent made by people who make scents.  This is my new go-to for winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, it lasts forever (I burn through most colognes in 3-5 hours, this one is still there after 8+), and is very rich and complex.  I don&#x27;t pretend to be able to identify every note present, but it reminds me of holiday baking--pumpkin pie and the like.  A little goes a long way.  One spray on chest (plus/minus an additional on one wrist and then touch the other wrist as stated in a previous review) is enough.  I&#x27;m betting this little 1.7oz bottle will last me all winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I&#x27;m hoping it will be gone, because it is, as others have stated, a factory second.  The registration code was removed, even though it was bought directly from Amazon.  This is fine with me, inasmuch as the scent is intact (smells just like the one at the department store), but I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll remain that way.  I guess I&#x27;ll just try to use it up fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the reason I felt like I had to review this is because it is among the best colognes I&#x27;ve ever run across, and the bottle only cost me $30 or so.  Amazon&#x27;s asinine policy of sending out bottles of it that aren&#x27;t good enough to be sold elsewhere lost it a star, but overall, I think the purchase was still worth it, and I won&#x27;t be returning it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this fragrance.  The same scent is often found in the lobbies of apartment leasing offices and model homes in the South OC area.  Whatever images or feelings that conjures up for you may be positive, but not so for me.</li>
    <li> I met my fianc&amp;eacute; literally because I was wearing this stuff. The scent is amazing, it literally makes women crazy!!!. I mean they already are crazy but seriously this stuff brought me so much attention you won&#x27;t want to leave the house after a while, you&#x27;ll be so tired of all the comments. I was at a speed dating event. After my first 5 minute date the girl said \\&quot; I don&#x27;t know what you said in the last 5 minutes because all I can think about is licking that scent off your body. Needless to say this led to a date and another date and the rest of history. Where engaged now- 2 years later and this cologne is all I ever wear.  I LOVE it. The woman who sold me the first bottle in a large department store told me in a serious voice, \\&quot;dude\\&quot; this stuff if dangerous, you must be careful wearing this it may just get you more attention then you can handle\\&quot;. LOL.  Buy this!!!</li>
    <li> Angel has been my signiture pefume as a woman. SOO.. i bought my boyfriend the male version of it! Only makes sense right?! He loves it.. and people get a kick out of it when we both smell similar but in our own gender way!</li>
    <li> So I got two of these from my px only to find that they were weaker than the one I had gotten in the Amazon find. This is totally worth it guys, and chicks love it</li>
    <li> Obviously, its the correct cologne and not an imitation, or reformulated........but, something fishy is going on. Why do everytime I purchase Angel Men the product code is ripped off the inside top? Without the code there is no way to register with the manufacturer.........contacted FragrenceNet.com and they stated thats how the get it from the manufacturer? Whats going on here......people are paying for â€œnew&amp;#34; products and are not recieving the whole package they are paying for. Love the cologne and price, but come on, don&#x27;t treat your cutomers like they are dumb. Tell us the truth, what is going on with this? We are not blind.....</li>
    <li> Simply the best fragrance a man can wear!  It does well with persons with severe allergies, and the price was awesome.  I will continue to order.</li>
    <li> Great Service and item</li>
    <li> I agree with most of the other reviewers, this is some strong stuff.  Just a couple of spritzes, one on the front of the neck and one on the back, and I&#x27;m good.  The first 30 minutes or so can be overwhelming.  But once the fragrance begins to settle a bit, it is fantastic.  Heavy vanilla and tar notes give it a very &#x27;warm&#x27; scent.  Heck, it almost feels warm when you spray it on.  Since it is so heavy and dark, I only wear this during the winter months.</li>
    <li> My son in law is very pleased with Angel. Fragrance is very nice and refreshing. It was a Christmas gift.</li>
