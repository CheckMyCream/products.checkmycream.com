<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Soft? Not at all. Cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Great value and durable brushes.</li>
    <li> Another excellent deal for Toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Good, small head size</li>
    <li> Cheap, but wear out really quickly. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> tgese are the best and with 3 of us I have 2 months worth of toothbrushes</li>
    <li> The toothbrushes are soft to brush one&#x27;s teeth, however, the handles are too big to fit in the toothbrush holder that is in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product an is happy to order them from you.</li>
    <li> Wear out after two weeks</li>
    <li> Hooray!  These will last me a long while, work well, and I don&#x27;t have to be forever remembering to include these on my grocery list!</li>
    <li> Bought this on a lightning deal for 99 cents. Great for the price!</li>
    <li> The work as advertised.  these are my disposable, travel toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Nice multipack for visitors who come and forget their toothbrush.  I can&#x27;t speak to quality, but there are six of them, and they&#x27;re inexpensive to provide to guests.</li>
    <li> Good deal. Work just fine lol</li>
    <li> These brushes are a bit disappointing.  They are not as soft as I have come to expect soft bristles to be</li>
    <li> For a decent price toothbrush that I can save even more when using the subscribe and save program, it gets the job done. Still no cavities when I visit the dentist!! That&#x27;s probably not all dependent on the toothbrush, but it is a good value.</li>
    <li> Not soft - hard and rough- hurt my gums&lt;br /&gt;Painful to brush teeth</li>
    <li> 6 toothbrushes for about $6 is a great deal.  These brushes are also good quality.  I also like that each brush can be separately removed.  So instead of tearing open the whole thing, you just rip open the perforated section of each toothbrush.  I will definitely buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Got these at a great price. Handles are plenty thick enough not to bend during use which tends to be an issue with toothbrushes at this good of a price. I would of paid more at a local store for 2 toothbrushes of similar quality. Fast shipping from amazon. Will buy these again</li>
    <li> Not so soft; uncomfortable handle with sharp plastic mold parting line.  The handle is small -- child-sized.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy and low-quality.  You get what you pay for, and here I would recommend getting 1-2 good toothbrushes instead of this pack of low-quality ones.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good quality toothbrushes. The bristles stay in shape very well.</li>
    <li> Great price! Love the variety of colors.The tooth brush itself is pretty stiff itself and made my gums bleed at first though.</li>
    <li> These get stiffer with use.</li>
    <li> Good price and my teeth be clean</li>
    <li> not the best but work just fine</li>
    <li> My fav toothbrushes at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Good  quality strong toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok, but smaller than I anticipated. The ad says full head, but smaller than most.  Has fly away bristles after only using couple of times.</li>
    <li> Works Well and You Can Not Beat The Price.</li>
    <li> Got these on subscribe and save for around $5.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the value. Good toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I bought these from my local favorite store, so I knew how they are. But purchasing them from Amazon saved me some change towards something else. Nice!</li>
    <li> these arrived at my house covered in soap from another order. You ever brush your teeth with soap? I just did. It blew. Bubbles.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my kids&#x27; toothbrushes, and they like these. I have 3 girls and 3 boys.</li>
    <li> Great cleaning bristles and seem to do the job of cleaning my teeth very well!</li>
    <li> they are thinner then expected</li>
    <li> Good price, good product, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for with these.  Don&#x27;t let the Colgate name fool you, they are are pretty low quality tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrushes. Good price.</li>
    <li> Head is too big and pointy</li>
    <li> Awesome. cant go wrong with these</li>
    <li> Great buy!  Each brush are a bit thinner than I expected.  But a good deal.</li>
    <li> These are the same toothbrushes i buy from the store but for less. They are awesome and always clean my teeth just perfectly :D</li>
    <li> Love this brushes! I prefer the not soft ones when it comes to toothbrush. Suits my style.</li>
    <li> They do the job. I use them as auxiliar toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> So cheap and holds up great! Prefect for replacing everyone&#x27;s toothbrush all at once!</li>
    <li> Soft is a little firmer than I expected, but otherwise great. Easy to hold, and normal shaped bristles.</li>
    <li> Not soft. More like medium</li>
    <li> Travel brushes, since I seem to keep on forgetting these at the hotels I&#x27;m staying. Cheap and does the job.</li>
    <li> Just like the multi-pack you would buy in the store, except probably cheaper! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> this product met all of my expectations and surpassed them. the item is quality personified and would definitely do business again!</li>
    <li> Decent brushes for a good price</li>
    <li> Good deal for toothbrushes</li>
    <li> These brushes don&#x27;t have a very good grip.  Seems like they reduced the amount of plastic by 25% to save money and for my average size hands (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&amp;#34;) I find I have to grip the brush tighter than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Does not feel like soft bristles. They are harsh on my gums...ouch!</li>
    <li> Great deal. I have this item on auto-delivery for every couple of months. It allows me to routinely change my toothbrush but also have some extras for guests that forget their toothbrush. Colgate is a brand I trust and this item was delivered in a timely manner as always.</li>
    <li> Says soft. Still rough on my gums and teeth</li>
    <li> Great, my usual brushes right at home! :-)</li>
    <li> Great price on good quality basic toothbrushes for the family.</li>
    <li> good brushes for good price.</li>
    <li> Bristles were not that soft</li>
    <li> I love the fact, I can get these on autoship.  A nice simple toothbrush with a soft head.  Great for familys and nice to have extras for travel and overnighters.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re supposed to replace your toothbrush every so often, and with two adults here in the house it&#x27;s nice to have extras on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come in multiple colors which makes it easy to distinguish between two people using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrushes are pretty much as described. Soft (if you bought the soft and not the medium) with a firm but flexible-ish neck. They do a good job of cleaning my teeth, and I&#x27;m glad that I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> They are not too soft. This one would be medium, as for me. They are also very durable with a firm and flexible handle. Seemed to hold up well and didn&#x27;t scrape the gums harshly the way some toothbrushes can do. I like toothbrushes with large heads, and this toothbrush has one. My mouth feels cleaner after I use it than with most manual toothbrushes, but the “soft” bristles are more what I’d call a medium. Good quality!</li>
    <li> Colgate.. enough said.</li>
    <li> Great price for great quality toothbrushes. This toothbrush doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums at all and that&#x27;s the most important thing I look for. I have really sensitive gums so I&#x27;m extra careful with what I use. These are really great.</li>
    <li> Nice toothbrushes. Gentle on the gums.Cleans very well.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest but not bad and a good value for a large family or if you change your toothbrush frequently.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper then buying them individually. They are very sturdy brushes and the bristles take longer to loose effectiveness as other toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. I keep these as extras for guests as needed</li>
    <li> Use them at the same time for maximum cleaning results.</li>
    <li> MY TEETH ARE SO CLEAN! WOW! FIVE STARS!</li>
    <li> Good price for those of us that like to keep these kind of things stocked up at home.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good set! Saves me both the time and money by having this pack on ready.</li>
    <li> For large families, vacations or oral hygiene advocates, i would recommend this steal.  I have never found such a great deal!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Overall good price for a set of six! I use them as a backup.</li>
    <li> They are OK.  Rather unsubstantial, but seem to get the job done.  They were a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> I dislike this toothbrush. I usually use an Oral B toothbrush and had gotten used to the firm grip on the handle that the Oral B affords me. The OralB has an ergonomically shaped handle that is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Colgate Extra Clean has a shorter handle by about 1/2 inch and it is rounded. As a result of the roundness it tends to slip or spin in my hand as I&#x27;m brushing my teeth.. and the shorter length just makes it feel like it&#x27;s a childs toothbrush rather than for an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this while on a vacation because I forgot to bring my Oral-B toothbrush. It was an impulse buy as it was on display in the front of the store. Bad purchase. I would never purchase this style again and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice firm/soft feel to the brushes, excellent for sensitive gums. My big gripe is the pointed bottom needs to be rounded otherwise it &#x27;digs&#x27; into your palm as you are brushing your teeth.  Another solution is to lengthen the handle which is already a tad short. Would I buy this again? Yes, because it has the right &#x27;feel&#x27; on my teeth and gums, hopefully my palm will develop a callous by the next purchase :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a good deal and brand name.</li>
    <li> It says 6 but only 5 on pack&lt;br /&gt;Really bad product</li>
    <li> These are cheap toothbrushes. Not cheap in a good way, cheap as in cheaply-made. I never thought I would care that much about the quality of a toothbrush but as soon as I picked one up I thought the handle was too thin, too light, not flexible enough and had poor grip. They&#x27;re made to look like they have rubberized grips but that&#x27;s just colored plastic. The bristles are way too firm and brushing feels harsh. After a week of using this toothbrush my gums were feeling sensitive from the abuse. So these are going in the garbage. I think there is value to a more expensive and higher quality toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a basic toothbrush, it works, and there are six of them. Great to use for travel or whatever else you might need a toothbrush for.</li>
    <li> Colgate makes a good toothbrush and these are some of them, like them a lot. I can recommend them with confidence, good product.</li>
    <li> This brush feels and works well on my teeth and mouth.  The size is appropriate and solid.  Well constructed with solid bristles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but it feels like the same &amp;#34;mediums&amp;#34; that I just tossed away!&lt;br /&gt;My parents said it was good but thats their opinion, so....</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush at a good price.</li>
    <li> Great price for good toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I like to always stock up on these. Like the price.</li>
    <li> brush into 5 stars :-)</li>
    <li> great price, narrow size reaches waay back</li>
    <li> Ususally on the first day of switching toothbrush, I would find some bleeding from my gum. This one worked just fine from the very beginning!</li>
    <li> We always use an electric toothbrush at night, but use a manual one in the morning and afternoon.  These are just perfect for the job and help me remember to always have a new toothbrush ready for replacement.</li>
    <li> Honestly not a fan. They&#x27;re mediocre at best. They were a little harsh but did not do a great job with periodontal care. Recommend to have for emergencies or house guests.</li>
    <li> totally not like description, and not knowing&lt;br /&gt;i was given a Promotional certificate I actually got freewith money from damaged product but wish I knew about product and certificate and would have gotten money off a higher priced order!!!</li>
    <li> I approve these toothbrushes. They are far better quality than some I&#x27;ve seen in stores for $3.00 apiece. I usually use a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; bristle feel, but I bought these on account of the fact that some reviewers stated they were not really that soft. And just like Goldilocks, these are just right. For me. If you want super soft bristles, the kind as soft as angel farts, please look elsewhere. Otherwise, great value. Especially when using Subscribe &amp; Save combined with Amazon Mom.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery! Product as described.</li>
    <li> These are good basic toothbrushes.  My only problem with them is that there is no color on the head of the toothbrush, so you can&#x27;t really tell which one is yours at a glance.</li>
    <li> My husband and I really disliked these toothbrushes. They&#x27;re flimsy plastic, with a small head, and sharp bristles. We tossed them after a couple uses. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> These brushes are harder than I was expecting. Had I known that they were to feel like this I would not have purchased them.</li>
    <li> excellent toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for a toothbrush.  I like the fact that you can purchase several in a package, since toothbrushes  need to be thrown away once the bristles start bending.  With multiple people in the house, you can also designate different color toothbrushes to different members of the household.  If you like a soft toothbrush, I would definitely recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> nice toothbrush and cheaper than what I brought at kroger</li>
    <li> Good value for decent quality toothbrushes.  My main complaint is that they seem way firmer than what I would consider a soft toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price. Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> These tooth brushes are made in China, so who knows what kind of possibly unsafe plastic is used to make them.</li>
    <li> Awesome having toothbrushes delivered to my door. No complaints!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for when you are traveling, I much prefer the Colgate 360 for everyday use</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it is soft.</li>
    <li> A great value. Good to have for company.</li>
    <li> They are affordable toothbrushes.  No surprises here.</li>
    <li> good toothbrushes. they are soft headed and gentle. they still get the job done</li>
    <li> Love that you can subscribe to these and save on them. They are your standard tooth brush, but I&#x27;m a repeat buyer because it&#x27;s convenient to receive these in my door step at a discount every time I need some.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrushes very much.  The full heads are shaped well for my mouth.  I can get into all the crevices we have towards the back of our mouth easily.  I brush 2 or 3 times a day and change my toothbrush out at the first signs of bristle wear.  These brushes seem to last longer than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Only brand of toothbrush I use.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> not really what I expected to get.</li>
    <li> They get the yuck off.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap toothbrush.  If you need a cheap toothbrush, then get these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is large, which is okay, I guess.  I suspect that some people will really like that, and others will really dislike it, and that most people will be like me and not care a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is too skinny for me.  It&#x27;s thicker than a pencil, but not by much.  There&#x27;s also something about the grip, or the way that it goes from slightly thicker to thin again that seems to land in exactly the wrong spot for my fingers.  Perhaps it&#x27;s just my arthritic fingers, but I just can&#x27;t use this with any kind of comfort.  The rest of these are going in the &amp;#34;in case you forgot something&amp;#34; cabinet for guests.</li>
    <li> It cleans your teeth.</li>
    <li> Good value. Not as soft as I hoped but work fine.</li>
    <li> It was delivered in a timely manner and everything was intact, thanks!</li>
    <li> Cheap and effective, but not great quality.</li>
    <li> While I use a sonic toothbrush, I use these old school.brushes after lunch. And I like to use a new one every few weeks which adds up.  These tooth rushes are just awesome.  The affordability factor is important.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t wear out like other brushes, meaning you don&#x27;t end up w/ bristles in your mouth.  We end up tossing out for fresh ones after a few months for hygiene purposes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pack of toothbrushes.  They work for brushing teeth.</li>
    <li> This is my chosen toothbrush because its bristles are gentle on my gums and teeth. It lasts long too.</li>
    <li> bristles are quite firm for a soft brush</li>
    <li> good price, straight forward purchase</li>
    <li> Are you one of those people that likes to have &#x27;extras&#x27; in the house? You buy something BEFORE you run out, not after.&lt;br /&gt;This set of value priced toothbrushes by Colgate are in assorted colors, great to have on hand for guests or if you accidently drop the toothbrush in the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t matter how clean you keep the loo, once you hear the dreaded ker-PLUNK, that brush is toast.&lt;br /&gt;Pull a fresh one out of this pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to find a name brand toothbrush at a per brush price as low as this. They feel better than the drug store bargain brand.&lt;br /&gt;Very good deal.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> What can I say - they&#x27;re toothbrushes. Good product for the price and the various colors are great for families.</li>
    <li> nice soft toothbrushes for sensitive teeth, great.</li>
    <li> Good to have extra toothbrushes when needed and for travel.</li>
    <li> The brushes are not soft at all</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat these. The bristles start off between Soft and Medium and quickly become Soft. Nice knowing I wont have to bother with toothbrushes for a few months with a single order of these. Whoever said the handle was flimsy was partially right, it&#x27;s just cheap plastic. But who cares? Get over it and move on with your life guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the toothbrushes and tooth brush.</li>
    <li> My gum bleeds every time I use this brush.</li>
    <li> My tusks are amazingly clean after using just one of these brushes.  And I only paid $.99 for all 6.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this style before and really like it.  Feels like it cleans teeth better.</li>
    <li> these are a good value</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush.......I think I will go back to the Reach brand. These handles are just so flimsy, but it does brush those teeth!</li>
    <li> I like that the bristles on this brush don&#x27;t go all flat after a few uses (my husband brushes quite vigorously). They clean teeth well, have a small head to get into the hard to reach places, and generally hold up well.</li>
    <li> Good deal with the subscribe and save..</li>
    <li> Great for travel. I grab one anytime I travel for work and just throw it away when I leave the hotel. I wouldn&#x27;t use these for my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; at home brush though, they are cheap and the bristles are very stiff.</li>
    <li> Works like a toothbrush should!</li>
    <li> A very good value. i was able to have a tooth brush at home and at work and will be able to change them on a regular basis since I have an ample suppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author Running for My Life-Winning for CMT</li>
    <li> Good Quality. Low price</li>
    <li> OK Brushes, but not soft at all. Says soft on packaging, but brushes are not soft at all</li>
    <li> perfect for the family</li>
    <li> Brushes are not soft, not very fine. The head is also pretty large for it&#x27;s size. It is easy to rinse and good for travel.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted...</li>
    <li> The handles on these toothbruses are skinny - not super comfortable to hold.  If I were purchasing again, I would consider these back-up toothbrushes for guests rather than everyday items.  Otherwise good - well constructed, bristles are soft, seems well-made.</li>
    <li> These are as expected.</li>
    <li> I like these toothbrushes are they are effective and yet on the cheaper end of toothbrushes. As someone who likes to change toothbrushes ever few weeks, this brand and style is the most cost effective for a family of five.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, exactly as described!</li>
    <li> They are not as soft as most soft toothe brushes I purchase but they are still pretty good. I prefer soft. I;d say these are medium</li>
    <li> Great deal! The brushes have just the right firmness - not too soft, not too firm.</li>
    <li> Durable , easy on the gums , 6- pack , &amp; CHEAP&lt;br /&gt;10/10</li>
    <li> These brushes are definitely not your average &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes! I would say they are more of a medium, but they are still so the job. For the price, I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush and great price.  I&#x27;m not swayed by fancy heads and multi-faceted arrays of bristles.  My teeth want something soft but durable.  The brush doesn&#x27;t matter as much as the technique.  Circle circle angle angle.</li>
    <li> Very good tooth brushes at an outstanding price.  I&#x27;ve had some problems with bleeding gums in the past even with other brand &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes but these don&#x27;t cause problems. Buy several packs in case of emergencies.</li>
    <li> do not buy it.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not soft at all</li>
    <li> Not soft like advertised. Even our son got a sore in his mouth from regular brushing with it. Good price, but you get what you pay for in this instance.</li>
    <li> no excuses for scum mouth......</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t spend a whole lot on toothbrushes.  I use a Braun electric toothbrush in the evening.  The toothbrushes I usually buy at this price are small.  This is a full size head.  I seem to recall a Consumer Reports review which stated the expensive toothbrushes did not clean any better than the less expensive ones.</li>
    <li> These are priced very nicely and the smaller tapering at the top makes getting into those tough spots so easy.</li>
    <li> Not great toothbrushes. Small heads.</li>
    <li> As I expected them to be - hubby complained they weren&#x27;t soft enough though. I thought they were fine!</li>
    <li> These are more like medium-soft bristles, which I&#x27;m not too happy about since soft bristles are better for your teeth and gums to prevent/slow enamel erosion and receding gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah well. I&#x27;ll just be careful brushing and will be using these as travel toothbrushes in the meantime.</li>
    <li> I use these to brush my teeth.  They seem to enjoy.  Feel softer than I expected though...</li>
    <li> These are not soft. They are more on the firm side.</li>
    <li> nice toothbrushes , soft and cheap</li>
    <li> These are not really &#x27;soft&#x27; bristles. Kinda hard for my taste.</li>
    <li> Always pays to have extra toothbrushes, this was so reasonably priced I ordered it and they are Great!!</li>
    <li> Not a favorite of mine.  I have bought these several times and each time the bristles fall out sooner than other brands (based on my style of brushing).</li>
    <li> perfect toothbrush, great buy at &amp;#60;95 cents per toothbrush.  I use them for cleaning jewelry, teeth and grout.  Giddy up.</li>
    <li> These are good, inexpensive toothbrushes.  With the subscribe &amp; save discount, the price is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> These are a great price for some good toothbrushes. I like to have a reserve at all times just incase I lose one or drop it on a dirty floor. My only sort of complaint is that these are not the softest bristles, so if you have really sensitive teeth even the soft version of these may not be for you.</li>
    <li> When I first received these tooth brushes, I didn&#x27;t think that much of them. They are shaped in a way that I thought would be not to my liking, but they are not bad at all. I have said that shopping for tooth paste and tooth brushes now days is like car shopping. There are so many models, and so many varieties of each model that it gets very confusing to say the least. I try to select the old familiar things to buy for my personal needs, and I thought that was what I was getting here. The product description, like so many times on Amazon&#x27;s site, left a lot to be desired, and there was no good description of how the brushes were shaped, or no fancy name to clue you in.</li>
    <li> Very nice tooth brushes and very nice price</li>
    <li> they are tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about a package of tooth brushes, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, great value :)</li>
    <li> Nothing better than using a nice new toothbrush!</li>
    <li> The bristles are ok. But the handle is so flimsy. Feels like holding a cheap plastic stick!</li>
    <li> i love how they pack six toothbrushes into one pack</li>
    <li> They are very rough on the gums, I had to stop using because they were cutting my gums, and I have healthy gums so that was not the issue.</li>
    <li> Still slighty hard not that soft</li>
    <li> got these for our frequent overnight guests who often forget theirs. I reccomend getting travel cases and keep everyone in your home best and organized!</li>
    <li> good deal fast regular delivery</li>
    <li> The bristles are SO HARD! They are definitely not soft. It feels like brushing teeth with wires. Terrible. After 2 days of using it, my teeth hurt the whole day because it damaged my gums. I thought I was getting a great deal, but now I have 6 toothbrushes that I can use maybe for tile cleaning. Stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> Smaller than you would expect</li>
    <li> The price was good and the reviews were good so we ordered a pack as spares. Don&#x27;t think we can go wrong with Colgate!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cheap, and they work, but as others noted, they are not the softest.  I really think they&#x27;re about a medium, and a bit flimsy at that.  You get what you pay for in this case.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush. Cheap.</li>
    <li> We use these to exfoliate our skin and as travel toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For brushing teeth - there is not a better manual toothbrush IMHO. These work great and are economically priced.&lt;br /&gt;For exfoliation - the bristles are a little rough. I use these, but probably would prefer a softer bristle for future brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - these are great and well-priced.</li>
    <li> Bristles are a little hard</li>
    <li> great price, great value. Love to have extra tooth brushes around for kids who spend the night or ready for when our kids need new ones</li>
    <li> Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> These are not soft/medium bristles. They are hard.</li>
    <li> Economic choice with good quality</li>
    <li> very happy with product and seller</li>
    <li> not as soft as expected but they do the job!</li>
    <li> A basic toothbrush that works. I had some trouble with some loose bristles coming out of the brush. There are six toothbrushes though and they were fairly cheap, so it is easy enough solved by just grabbing another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head of the brush seems a bit small but it is useful for cleaning. At first, it seemed too soft, but as I used it, it seemed tougher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a basic toothbrush for brushing your teeth. Works, but no thrills, no frills.</li>
    <li> These are NOT soft toothbrushes. I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;re even legally allowed to call them that. I kept them because well, who returns toothbrushes? But I&#x27;ve been brushing very carefully.</li>
    <li> CUT MY GUMS AND MOUTH DO NOT BUY! DANGEROUS! These are incorrectly labeled as soft and are really extra hard. Would return if the window hadn&#x27;t passed.</li>
    <li> A little to soft for me, but they work fine.</li>
    <li> I think this toothbrush has Really Stiff Hard Bristles and I don&#x27;t like brushing with it. Ordered the Soft, but Yeccch.  Can&#x27;t image the pain those who ordered the medium might be going through!  Won&#x27;t get them again.</li>
    <li> As several other reviewers have already noted, these brushes are not soft, and labeling them as such is misleading.</li>
