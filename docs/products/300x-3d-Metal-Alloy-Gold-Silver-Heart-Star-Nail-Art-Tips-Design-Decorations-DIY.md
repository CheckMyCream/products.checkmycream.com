<li> and they are not too big not too small.</li>
<li> Just $1.40 for 400 little nail art 3d nail decorations.  </li>
<li> They were packaged in 6 tiny little ziplock baggies and I was totally bored watching TV</li>
<li> Falsely advertised.</li>

    <li> These are so adorable. I love them i received them so fast and they are not too big not too small.</li>
    <li> When shipment was received it was five small bags of hearts and no other shapes. I was under the impression it would be a variety pack. I have not contacted the sender yet.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 5 set dotting pens and the Metal alloy heart nail designs and realized later that they shorted my order , only the dotters came , I ordered so much stuff and it all came @ once and overlooked  the shortage,then waited for it and the nail designs never arrived ..will keep you posted on how that was handled</li>
    <li> I received exactly what was shown in the picture and in perfect condition! I am very pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Catherine</li>

    <li> Great product for prices and very durable, easy to use.  Lived up to all my expectations for performance!!  Good deal!</li>
    <li> Awesome price for a lot of nail art pieces.  I should have bought more then I could use them in nail swaps...  Definitely a great item to spruce up a dull manicure.</li>
    <li> On the selling page you can choose if you want hearts, stars, diamonds or otherwise, i did not choose hearts and thats what i was sent. not going through he hassle of a return.</li>
    <li> Very nice, just as described</li>

    <li> I was thrilled to receive exactly what I ordered.  I placed an order for 300 of the little hearts and they arrived from China just over 2 weeks later. They were packaged in 6 tiny little ziplock baggies and I was totally bored watching TV so I counted them.  I ended up with just over 400, so that was a bonus to get 30% more than I paid for.  Honestly, this is such a steal.  Just $1.40 for 400 little nail art 3d nail decorations.  And free shipping.  I love them.  They work great if you apply them correctly and you MUST top coat them.  No way around that.</li>
