      <li>This is a great shampoo for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Indeed, no one wanted to give this shampoo up to try another kind</li>
      <li>it perks up nice with this.</li>
      <li>(some kind of sickness or something), my hair stopped falling off after three days of using another shampoo.</li>
      <li>I noticed when I squeeze them they leave a kind of oil on my finger tips.</li>

      <li>Might not be as great as the $20+ shampoos, but for $6, it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>safe, effective, shampoo</li>
      <li>As mentioned, I have very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Dove i heard is the best brand and only brand that doesnt use wheat in most of their products so if you are gluten free or have celiac disease this would be great for you.</li>
      <li>It smells great, very clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>It is very light and gives my hair lots of moveability.</li>

      <li>This shampoo is so much better.</li>
      <li>it works better.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> safe, effective, shampoo</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shampoo....it is not runny it is very thick and lathers well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sick of the incredibly over-inflated prices of the &amp;#34;professional salon&amp;#34; shampoos and conditioners….they are often quite nice, but I always question if they are really worth three to four times the prices of what you can buy in the drugstores.  This shampoo is one of several cheaper shampoos I&#x27;ve tried lately and it seems pretty good.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the negative things mentioned in other reviews, such as those little beads in the hair, I can&#x27;t imagine where that came from as I haven&#x27;t seen it.  The shampoo has a nice, mild scent (scent is important to me as some shampoos have a really sickening scent), it&#x27;s of a good thickness, it cleans nicely, it washes out well.  I don&#x27;t see anything particularly special about it, but it does the job and leaves my hair feeling nice.  I use other conditioning products on my hair after washing….a conditioner in the shower, a spray of leave-in conditioner, and some hair oil moisturizers for my ends.  I have very fine, fragile hair (highlighting) and somewhat dry hair (at the ends)  and I&#x27;m happy with how my hair feels and behaves, so I give it 4 stars.  Good price, too!</li>
    <li> smells and works great,price here better then store!</li>
    <li> First product review I&#x27;ve ever written here!!! First off, I have fine, slightly wavy, over-processed, (as in bleached and colored)  shoulder-length hair, along with various scalp issues that is basically pissed off at the world, 99.9% of the time. Styling is labor-intensive with typically average to below average results IMO. I am very knowledgeable about products and styling tools; I swear I have bought one of everything!!! Drum roll . . . This stuff is crazy amazing!!! I have used it from time to time since I bought it nearly a year ago at my local Meijer store. EVERY TIME I USE IT, my hair is transformed into sleek, shiny, MOISTURIZED hair found only in a magazine. I&#x27;m not kidding!!! I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner with it. And then, styling was a snap!!! I did use a very minimal amount of styling products (Aveda Damage Control and Aveda Sleek Infusion), but I&#x27;m confident I could have done without. From the time I combed it out, until the time I pulled the last of it through the flat iron, it was less than a half hour!!! Absolutely amazing for me!!! And I felt beautiful. I was my prettiest me. It&#x27;s been a long time since I felt that good about myself. Try it, you may just love it!!!</li>
    <li> I got a good sized sample of this shampoo and conditioner from new beauty test tube. I&#x27;ve only been using it for like a week but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for daily use. I think it is like a clarifying shampoo, it makes my hair sooo squeaky clean it&#x27;s almost unsettling. Way too dry and after I wash it, it looks terrible and damaged. I cannot comb through my hair anymore wet or dry without breaking my hair. And that&#x27;s after using the conditioner. Maybe this would be useful to clarify however I noticed today that it leaves tiny hard clear beads on my scalp! What the heck. I&#x27;m not even going to finish the sample as a clarifier. Do not recommend. I also want to mention my hair is normally extremely oily to the point where it&#x27;s oil soaked halfway through the day after I just washed it. This shampoo has resolved that problem and now it&#x27;s less oily than usual (maybe can go 24 hrs without washing) but at what cost? Awful</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I can&#x27;t believe so many negative reviews. Maybe they are used to having to use a lot of shampoo to get their hair clean. With this I have noticed a little goes a long way. Although I still use a fair amount of conditioner in the ends of my hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t lay flat on my head it perks up nice with this. Moisture beads?? I have never found any moisture beads.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is suitable to use daily, it cleans gently but does not weight hair down.  Perfect for thin, fine hair.  Leaves hair with body but doesn&#x27;t overdry.</li>
    <li> this shampoo also is a gentle moisturizer.. love it.. bought several more..</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! It leaves my hair feeling very clean. Not oily or dry like some other shampoos. I highly recommend you at least try this shampoo. Might not be as great as the $20+ shampoos, but for $6, it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> i could not find this at my local target or walmart. glad i found it on amazon. price ws cheaper than wat i paid for in the retail store. i have fine hair and this shampoo is one of the few that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. also doesn&#x27;t cause buildup. great for every day use, although i might alternate between this shampoo and a deep cleansing one, for good measure.</li>
    <li> My favorite brand for my shower time is Dove. However, this Dove oxygen moisture shampoo smells so good. When my hair has dried it is soft, doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch, and it smells fantastic. My husband grabs my hair and smells it several times in a day. ;.)</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and it has been working fantastic for my hair type. I have fine hair, but I have a lot of it. Most shampoos have a tendency to weigh my hair down. The Dove Oxygen Moisture Shampoo leaves my hair feeling soft and light weight. I will definitely purchase more when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t use this shampoo but I got it for my wife.  So I will be letting you know her opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Her hair type is thick and straight.  She said it left her hair feeling soft and had a nice smell as well.  She did say you need to use it with other products still to get your hair right.  But that&#x27;s shampoo in general anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Overall she said it is probably worth the money.  But nothing special.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad to say that my hair was flyaway from this product.  Both the shampoo and conditioner.  I have color-treated hair.  I guess I will stick with my current shampoo - Nexxus.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for fine hair.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or leave it oily like some shampoos.  I like the pleasant, not too strong, scent.  Makes a great family shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big proponent of Dove products.  It&#x27;s my brand of choice for shampoos, soaps, deodorants, and shaving products.  My only issue is that they tend to be a little overpriced in stores.  That&#x27;s why I always appreciate getting them at a deal here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, let me state outright that I&#x27;m not all that picky with shampoos and such.  That said, I like this one.  At first I thought the smell was a little too chemical for my liking, but it&#x27;s grown on me.  However, I do think the conditioner smells better oddly enough.  I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in volume or the texture of my hair, but then I&#x27;m a short-haired guy and wasn&#x27;t really looking for that.  Sometimes I think regardless of label, the solutions can&#x27;t be that much different (volume enhancer, wavy hair, shine and sleek, etc.).  But it gets the job done and leaves my head feeling clean, so no complaints.</li>
    <li> I rarely use drugstore hair products (moms a cosmetologist) but I do love the consistency of this shampoo. So far, no matter how dirty my hair has been, it has lathered completely on the first wash. My hair is stick straight and super flat, so I tend to gravitate towards volumizing shampoos... I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference with this, but I can definitely feel the little &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; it gives my hair. I agree with the others about finding the little moisture balls on my scalp throughout the day, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. As for the smell, nothing special there- just your average &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; scent.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy, very oily hair that I must shampoo every day.  Conditioners were a no-no since it left my hair flat. I am currently using Pert Plus and Prell which does a good job of cleansing my hair (more than others), I decided to try this at my local drugstore because my hair was lacking body and bounce.  The first shampoo and I noticed how bouncy my hair was and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  I will use this in my rotation with my other two.  If I use one shampoo too often, it builds up residue.  I love the light, fresh scent and it makes a lot of lather with just a little amount applied.  Amazon has a better price so I&#x27;ll re-order through them.</li>
    <li> I find cosmetic companies&#x27; advertising claims to be meaningless hype, and &amp;#34;oxygen fused ingredients&amp;#34; (what does that even mean?) is no exception.  BUT I do like a few things about this shampoo and one of them is that it leaves my hair very clean.  I&#x27;m middle-aged, with dry hair and skin, so I try to shampoo only every other day instead of daily.  With some shampoos my hair is flat or limp or greasy by day 2 but with this Dove it still looks clean the second day.  It works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;+ Very thick, so it doesn&#x27;t run off of my hand or my head before I even start lathering... I feel this is less wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;+ Leaves my hair very clean and not limp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE MEH:&lt;br /&gt;- Boring scent.  I like a little aromatherapy in my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  Not groundbreaking but I enjoy how clean and un-weighed-down it leaves my hair.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft and light, really bouncy!  I have fine, thick hair.  I use with the Oxygen Moisture Conditioner and one squirt of Dove cream oil on the ends of my hair before blow dry.</li>
    <li> In many ways I like this shampoo: it has a light scent; it doesn&#x27;t foam excessively; it rinses nicely.  But it adds no volume to my baby-fine hair and my hair seems to get dirty faster after using it.  So it&#x27;s a no-go for my situation.</li>
    <li> I love the overall idea of the product, but just seems to be an average shampoo (&amp; conditioner). The smell is great and does leave my hair smooth and soft, but does nothing to help with volume. Throughout the day I would get a random itch on my scalp and would discover a moisture bead in my hair! I thoroughly rinse my hair and still have found these &amp;#34;moisture beads&amp;#34; on my scalp. Of course everyone&#x27;s hair is different so give it a try, but watch out for the lingering moisture beads!</li>
    <li> From what I&#x27;ve gathered, this shampoo cleans extremely well- so thoroughly that other&#x27;s hair might be completely dried out.  As someone who has had the greasiest hair though, I&#x27;m totally in love with this shampoo!~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for several year to replace my favorite shampoo, Herbal Essence&#x27;s Degunkify, the only shampoo that could actually get my hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, within 24 hours of not washing my hair, my head will look slimy and greasy to the point of over-gelled, but after using this shampoo for the 3rd time, I was able to use one of those creamy, &amp;#34;revitalizing&amp;#34; shampoos and conditioners, and my hair looked amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as this shampoo is around, I&#x27;ll be buying it!</li>
    <li> The first thing that put me off is the fact that the top was off the bottle and 90 percent of the contents was spilled into the padded envelope and my mailbox. It took me a half hour to clean everything up and find I actually had enough left to wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is thick and creamy and smells really fresh, not perfumed. It suds up thicker than my usual shampoo but I didn&#x27;t feel like it cleaned as well. My hair felt thicker, but like it was coated. After drying my hair it was quite a bit more tangled, but I didn&#x27;t use a conditioner. Once completely dry, my hair did feel softer and fuller. Even the next day my very curly hair feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> I love the new Oxygen Moisture line by Dove.  It is great.  The smell is fantastic.  It lathers well and rinses clean leaving soft, smooth hair after rinsing.  It is the perfect pairing with the Oxygen Moisture conditioner.  The combo is perfect for my fine hair and really did give a little more fullness.  It is reasonably priced, and I would buy it again.  Great product with an exceptionally nice scent!</li>
    <li> I have tried many shampoos, trying to find the perfect one for my long thin fine colored hair, and this is the closest to perfect I have found.  Even while shampooing, my hair felt moisturized.  The fragrance was pleasant and I didn&#x27;t have to use too much to get a good lather.  Combined with Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner, this left my hair very very soft and with a fullness that I rarely see with other shampoos.  The only negative I found was that the lid broke off at the hinge the first time I opened the shampoo, so perhaps a stronger lid/hinge is needed.  I will gladly overlook that minor issue, though, for the great results I got with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed many of the Dove family of products. The soaps and the body washes have been favorites because they work well with my sensitive skin. But this was the first time I had picked up Dove shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo smells good- not too strong and perfume like. There are little moisture beads in the shampoo. My daughter used it first because she has dry hair, and this particular shampoo is supposed to be very moisturizing. The problem was that when she had trouble fully rinsing her hair (as a child), she could find little white beads in her head when it dried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she made sure to rinse her hair fully, we didn&#x27;t have the problem. It did work to moisturize her hair. The quality of the shampoo is good for the price.</li>
    <li> The variety of Dove shampoo that I sampled was listed as adding volume.  After use, I did notice a little more volume - not as much as other volumizing shampoos I have tried - but this one did not dry out my hair as others tend to do.  There is very little scent, and it does not linger after rinsing out, which I like.  It seems like I&#x27;m able to go an extra day between shampoos.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I have fine and flat hair and have tried many different products over the years.  Many such products for just my kind of hair often claim to be hair thickening shampoos which also add volume.  Some help a little and some do nothing. This Dove Oxygen Moisture shampoo claims to give bounce and natural volume.  I am a guy with short hair so cannot comment on the bounce but a definite increase in volume was noticed by only the second day of use.  This shampoo is a pleasure to use.  Very little is needed to get a rich lather and it has a very pleasant clean scent.  I could really feel that it cleaned my hair thoroughly.  I did find that not as much volume was achieved if the shampoo was not used with the conditioner.  After using both my hair had a healthy volume not seen in a while.  The only negative I find is that if I only use this brand after about 2 week its effectiveness starts to lessen and the product starts to feel like it is weighing heavy on my hair. But all I need to do is switch to another brand for  a day or two and then the Dove again provides the great volume and adds the same natural feeling to my hair.  If you have fine and flat hair I&#x27;m sure you have also tried many products.  I definitely recommend giving this brand a shot.</li>
    <li> Love this line from Dove! Makes my hair shiny and manageable. I have somewhat oily hair that must be washed every other day. This line makes my hair stay looking good the whole time.!</li>
    <li> Dove is a great product &amp; so is this shampoo. leaves my hair clean &amp; shiny.  It is easy to handle hair after.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic difference in my hair between this shampoo and the regular dove moisture shampoo that i always use. The two minor differences i did notice however were that i liked the scent of this one better, its more sweet smelling, and its a thicker consistency. not sure if the latter is better or not.  i would recommend this to other dove shampoo fans.</li>
    <li> I have medium to thin hair that is fairly curly, which often results in frizzy flyaways. I am constantly looking for a shampoo that gives me silky, bouncy hair; however, I often find that when I come across a shampoo that accomplishes this, it is so overly moisturizing that after a few days of use, my hair becomes weighed down and looks oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is not like that. It is very light and gives my hair lots of moveability. Some people have said that the little moisture beads in the shampoo get stuck in their hair or that the shampoo overly dries their hair out, but I have not experienced either of these things. I have not become discouraged after about two months of use and will likely buy another bottle when this one is empty.</li>
    <li> I hope this comes on sale again. I love it.</li>
    <li> Like most women, I have used very expensive shampoos and conditioners. This is as good as any of the expensive brands. Extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair very squeaky clean.  When used with the conditioner it leaves my hair manageable and easy to style.</li>
    <li> I wish I read the other reviews before I bought this. I would have NEVER bought this shampoo had I known it had moisture BEADS in it, I use a shampoo to WASH things OUT of my hair not ADD odd things too it. The beads stay in your hair?! Plus It&#x27;s REALLY thick and not in a thick and rich and creamy way but thick like a hair gel paste way and it&#x27;s hard to lather its so thick. It was hard to rinse out and left my hair feeling like STRAW and KNOTTED. I literally couldn&#x27;t COMB my hair with a wide tooth comb after using this there were visible knots in my hair. I have thin flat hair and this made it much worse plus all knotted and dry. Gross. I felt like I needed to get right back in the shower. Never again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a month and I&#x27;ve got great results. I have a very fine, flat, dry and dull hair. This shampoo has actually made my hair shiny for the volume, bouncy and soft. He has a very light and Plesant sent, makes a really nice thick rather that he only have to wash your hair once to get clean hair and scalp. I will definitely continue to buy this shampoo and might try the conditioner as well to alternate between the one I am currently using, which is the Dove damage therapy daily moisture conditioner.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing this as my wife used it and reported on it, in combination with Dove Oxygen Moisture Shampoo. This is a combined reviewed that appears for both products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my wife&#x27;s report after some little while using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers nicely, and is very gentle. It gets hair clean without any sort of chemical feel and doesn&#x27;t cause hair damage. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it as it really expands. With a good rinse, there is none of that sticky &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; feel you get from some cheaper products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She continues to say that she thinks it is best to use with the conditioner. The conditioner also feels gentle, and it leaves her hair feeling soft with what you might call a bright appearance. The conditioner also helps her with a brittleness problem. She also says her hair is easier to comb out and style afterwards than with some of the products she previously used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes this product combination very much and plans to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Love love love this shampoo and conditioner.  I love the smell, the wash it washes and how my hair dries and styles with it.</li>
    <li> I first had the Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam and liked it so I thought I&#x27;d try this to see if they worked better together.  I hate to say that I am not impressed. My hair seems drier after using this rather than the claim of it adding moisture.  I&#x27;m not sure what the \\&quot;oxygen\\&quot; has to do with anything, but I suppose some marketing person promoted it as a positive thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is more like a gel when it comes out of the bottle.  You really don&#x27;t need much as it lathers extremely well.  My hair was squeaky clean in no time, which seemed more like a clarifying shampoo&#x27;s results than a moisturizing one.  I didn&#x27;t have their conditioner but used a volumizing one that I had, then rinsed and towel dried.  I then used the leave in foam and a heat activated conditioner I normally use and blew it dry.  My hair was soft and had some body, but was not as shiny as usual.  I&#x27;ve used it a number of times like this and, unfortunately, haven&#x27;t changed my opinion that it dries my hair more than my normal shampoo that I&#x27;ve been using for a couple years, Biolage by Matrix Hydratherapie Hydrating Shampoo, which was recommended by my hairdresser.  My hairdresser even commented that my hair seemed drier when I was in to see her last week for a trim and she had no idea that I&#x27;d been using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that you need to clarify your hair occasionally, especially if you use a lot of products on it regularly.  I will keep using this for that until it&#x27;s gone, and I will update if I feel anything has changed my opinion.  I do have color treated, fine textured, wavy hair, so that could make a difference, and it may work better for others.  I don&#x27;t see myself repurchasing this.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing and volumizing are often at odds with one another.  And frankly, well I don&#x27;t like the feeling of dry hair, I&#x27;m not usually too bothered by most shampoos and rarely do I feel the need for more volume, either!  But this is a solid product - my hair feels clean and not left with residue and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel flat or too dry, either.  The shampoo&#x27;s scent is pleasant without being overpowering or too perfumey.  It&#x27;s a fair shampoo representation of Dove bar soap, in fact . . . so if you like that, you&#x27;ll like this!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this shampoo because it was exactly the kind I needed for my thin, flat hair and I started going gray young so my hair has always needed all the moisture it can get. It&#x27;s Dove, so I also expected that wouldn&#x27;t even be a problem. Boy was I wrong. From the first time I used it I noticed that I lost a lot more hair in the shower than I ever did before. My hair also felt dry, like straw. I thought maybe the conditioner would help, but it didn&#x27;t do much except make it slimy-feeling. Even once I rinsed it out and toweled off my hair, it felt like the moisture beads were still in there gunking my hair up. I would have given it one star, but it did actually make my hair a little fuller in the back. Of course that was at the expense of my hair&#x27;s moisture and so I had a frizzy mess. Never again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but when it made me break out in itchy little bumps on my face I had to return it. The positives are that it is extremely clarifying, it has a unique thick lather that does not waste product, nice light scent (which I&#x27;m probably allergic to) and it made my hair soft. The negatives are that it would leave my hair with no shine and left it frizzy. It&#x27;s not a horrible product considering it&#x27;s pretty cheap, but it&#x27;s not for me. If anything I think the dry oil line by Dove is better.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo at a retail chain (not Amazon), so I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what.  The moisture beads don&#x27;t all dissolve and when my hair dried I found a few tiny glassy beads in my hair.  I freaked and thought they were some sort of egg...until I squished one and the obvious smell of shampoo wafted out.  I then I examined some shampoo from the bottle and found the beads (which I hadn&#x27;t noticed when I inititially lathered up).  The shampoo was alright but the leftover beads were off putting.</li>
    <li> I have not seen a difference in my hair with this product. It smells good and washes my hair well, but my hair is still very dry regardless of the claims.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is OK. Its not the best and its not the worst. i recently received a sample and used the whole 1fl oz. i don&#x27;t see anything special or different about it. Some people say its great for there hair. Maybe you should attempt to try it. Dove and the store that you purchase it from will let you take it back for a full refund even if its opened.</li>
    <li> Dove Shampoo with Oxygen Moisture is the best shampoo for my hair, hands down. I have really fine hair and it not only smells fantastic, but it gives my hair volume while leaving it shiny, not greasy. The only complaint that I might have with this shampoo is that it is so expensive. The best way to purchase this is on amazon because you can &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; to an order you already have going. This shampoo is almost twice as expensive as any other mid level brand but if you add it on to an order, you pay 50% the store price!</li>
    <li> basic shampoo so you can&#x27;t really go wrong plus there&#x27;s not much of a scent if that&#x27;s what you prefer.</li>
    <li> I first tried the conditioner with my other shampoo and loved it, then I tried both the shampoo and conditioner and felt like it really made a difference for me. I have long hair and it&#x27;s not as thick as it used to be, so I&#x27;m always looking for something to give me more volume and I really like this stuff! My hair isn&#x27;t thin, but it&#x27;s not thick either, and my part is a little wider then I like, so volume is definitely something I need. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I have been trying the gamut of shampoos lately, as my hair&#x27;s consistency has been changed by being on a medication that causes hair loss.  Vidal Sassoon, Aussie, Clairol, Suave even. All of them were tangling my hair to the point where I felt I was losing even more hair on comb out from not being able to comb out with a wide tooth comb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the series of 3 products and used a leave in detangler to comb out and the hair loss was 1/2 reduced!  AND the best part - my hair is lifted up OFF my scalp like it used to be before the medicine!!!  Cannot tell you how good that feels after six months of stuck to scalp feeling.  My hair looks very smooth too but not flat.  Exactly as the packaging advertised, what a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is a total surprise too - a gel, thicker than shaving gel.  I used a whole palmful but will be able to use much less in the future as it lathers like crazy and had the perfect feel after shampooing - squeaky but not tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really happy I found and tried this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to switch from a volumizing to get this, but it is worth it and looks more sleek and smooth.</li>
    <li> Awful product. The shampoo goes on thick. And like others have said leaves behind moisture beads. It makes my head itch. Would never recommend this product. Gross Dove, very disappointed in this one.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and I have tried so many different kinds/brands of shampoo and conditioner. The oxygen line by Dove was suggested by a Youtuber that also had really fine hair. This is the only shampoo/conditoner that has ever actually made a noticable difference! I love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see how leaving behind \\&quot;egg like\\&quot; moisture beads for you to discover throughout the day is a good thing. I didn&#x27;t appreciate the freak out moment I had when I discovered these beads lingering in my hair and on my scalp. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this at a store that takes returns, I will be returning both the shampoo and conditioner I purchased.</li>
    <li> I just bought this (elsewhere) and have been using for about a week.  I was checking the price on Amazon and had to comment after reading other reviews. Mine has no moisture beads. So, I&#x27;m not sure what that&#x27;s all about.  It smells great, very clean and fresh. My very fine (lifeless and flat) hair felt great after using the shampoo and conditioner. It was soft and fluffy.  No hair loss, as others have mentioned.  No oxygen miracles,  but it&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
    <li> my bestfriend with celiac disease (gluten sensitive immune disorder) left this at my house after visiting me so i just used it up. I have flat to fine hair that gets flat all the time and i definately think this helped a little bit. Dove i heard is the best brand and only brand that doesnt use wheat in most of their products so if you are gluten free or have celiac disease this would be great for you. The only thing i dont like about it is the lather, you kind of need a lot to make it all the way throughout long long hair. Also if you dont rinse thoroughly it will leave moisture beads in your hair. but other than that it works and it smells wonderful. i love doves philosophy and will continiue to buy their products.</li>
    <li> I have thin baby fine hair and always have trouble finding a shampoo and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. This stuff really works and is the first shampoo that I&#x27;ve actually used the whole bottle and bought another. Usually I get halfway through a bottle and the shampoo stops working so well...my daughter in law and granddaughters are never out of shampoo lol as they get 5 or 6 half bottles of the good stuff at a time! Really love this shampoo, love the lather and love the light scent it leaves behind. Does give my short hair more volume and bounce and I don&#x27;t usually do reviews.</li>
    <li> Luckily, I found these reviews in a google search.  I was actually searching for strange beads coming out of scalp and thought I had some horrible condition.  Good news, I use this shampoo and never thought about that being the cause.  Bad news, I will be throwing it out!</li>
    <li> I have been using the original Dove for a long time. I tried the oxygen moisture and it is really nice. It makes your hair feel super clean, has the same scent as the original and still moisturizes.</li>
    <li> I am 61 with waist length hair &amp; very little gray.  I have psoriasis &amp; the shampoo I used for many years was discontinued some time ago; scalp has never been the same; hair has been falling out too.  I have tried numerous shampoos; my linen closet reflects this.  Nothing helped; in fact, most often, made my situation worse.  I used this shampoo yesterday.  I am happy so far.  It&#x27;s not 100% but there is a difference &amp; I like it.  Will be upping to 5 stars if reaches 100% in the future.  l will continue to use til the bottle is empty.  I might be stock-piling on this shampoo by Thanksgiving, just incase this one gets discontinued.  The smell &amp; feel is very nice also.  I did not purchase the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Bottle was broken and spilled shampoo over everything else inside the package.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Her hair is shinier and healthier and has a lot of bounce. Will definitely re-order this and the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have pretty fine hair and I was using the conditioner without the moisture shampoo because I had a backlog of other shampoos. Once I switched to this shampoo and it&#x27;s paired conditioner I was really impressed. This doesn&#x27;t add a lot of body but it gives a great deal of shine and flyaway control. My hair is currently cut in a bob and I haven&#x27;t needed the straight iron with this shampoo. Clean feeling and light, a very tiny bit is all you need to use.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair dry, fly away, and flat.  Maybe with extra product it works better.  I won&#x27;t purchase this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and it looks dry and damaged. This shampoo instantly gave my hair a noticeable amount of volume and also makes it so much healthier. My hair feels light and clean! The shampoo is more like a gel so I only use a tiny bit and it lathers well. The smell isn&#x27;t so great but it does what it says it does!!</li>
    <li> This Dove Oxygen Moisture Shampoo has a subtle, pleasant scent, washes away cleanly, and- as advertised- delivers noticeably extra volume to your hair.  Myself, I&#x27;m glad I also tried (and described in a separate review) the companion Dove Oxygen Moisure Conditioner, which helped keep that extra volume under control.  But that&#x27;s just me; the shampoo alone is a fine product that will make your hair look clean and shiny, as well as smell nice.  This shampoo is a big hit in our household and I&#x27;d be inclined to get it again.</li>
    <li> I love Dove beauty products and I&#x27;m rarely disappointed by them, unfortunately this is one of the few times that I wasn&#x27;t entirely pleased with one of their products. After using this product for a month I can honestly say that there wasn&#x27;t any noticeable volume in my shoulder length, medium-thick hair. In fact, it seem to make my hair feel oily even after I used less shampoo. This particular product just didn&#x27;t work for my hair and maybe it&#x27;s just because of my hair type. It does have a very clean, fresh scent that lathers nicely and a little bit goes a long way, so it may work great for someone else&#x27;s hair type.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with shedding.  I was on a streak of at least 6 months without losing much hair, until I started using this shampoo.  Moisture beads are left in the hair after it is dried and I feel like it clogged the roots.</li>
    <li> The scent is great! The bottle looks cool! Problem is the shampoo is not all that wonderful. I could see maybe a little volume in my hair but the most notable was the residue it seemed to leave behind. Even with the conditioner, my hair felt dry and brittle. Would not use again.</li>
    <li> As mentioned, I have very fine hair.  Without the right shampoo/conditioner, it is lifeless and super straight.  I constantly work to find something that I like that is not super smelly or expensive.  This is pretty good.  The shampoo is really thick, which I actually liked.  It made me feel like I could use a little less (which probably is the recommended size) and still get a clean feeling.  I used this paired with the conditioner and have been happy with the result.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for several weeks.  It is light and makes my hair feel very clean. It moisturizes, but doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue. Smells great!  Shipping packaging was not great - the bottle arrived 3/4 empty with shampoo all over the packaging-- easy solution: tape the top of the bottle to secure it.</li>
    <li> I find myself really liking this old but almost forgotten name brand. They have stepped up to the bad with this one and have come up with a really unique hair product that fits the average budget. No need to go to the salon and pay high prices for a shampoo that leaves your your hair feeling like it has life! This product will satisfy AND not empty your wallet!</li>
    <li> I use Dove shampoo on pretty regular base and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it so I was willing to try this new oxygen moisture shampoo. I found this shampoo to be pretty nice. It has a good smell and a great lather. It cleaned my hair very nicely and after I dry my hair, it feels nice and soft. I would definitely continue using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have tried Dove shampoos in the past and figured I would love them because I love the soaps and deodorants. But the shampoo I have used in the past left my hair feeling heavy and like I couldn&#x27;t get everything out. This shampoo is so much better. It has a nice, fresh smell and lathers so well. It leaves my hair feeling light weight and manageable, not heavy and almost oily feeling. I would definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> My wife uses quite a bit of Dove products and she tried this shampoo for 3 weeks hoping to see more bounce and volume in her hair. However, after 3 weeks, she did not really notice much more volume. She has thick, medium length, black hair. She actually complained that the shampoo left her scalp a bit itchy. She said that while the shampoo didn&#x27;t work for her, it might work for other&#x27;s with different types of hair.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that shampoos get their share of five star reviews and one star reviews.  I have come to the conclusion that everyone has a certain body chemistry that works well with certain kinds of shampoo, and not so well with others.  Having said that, this shampoo got rave reviews at our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that the three people who have used it remark on the way it leaves their hair feel, along with the pleasant smell.  Indeed, no one wanted to give this shampoo up to try another kind (may I have that one back now, please?).  Yes, we have tried many different brands and types of shampoos, but there is something about the way this one works on our hair that makes us want to jump in the shower for a quick shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could quantify or explain better how this shampoo works for us, but I have yet to put my finger on it.  In the meantime, I can see this shampoo will be a popular buy when we need more shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> All day I have been finding little tiny clear beads on my scalp. I noticed when I squeeze them they leave a kind of oil on my finger tips. After doing a google search, I finally figured it out! It&#x27;s this shampoo! I didn&#x27;t even realize it had these little moisture beads, but you can be sure I won&#x27;t be continuing to use this product.</li>
    <li> Girls with thick dry natural curly hair listen up. The Dove oxygen care package says it is for thin hair BUT IT IS FOR US curly tops with thick hair too! Ohh my goodness I am in love with Dove Oxygen Moisture Shampoo .  I am beyond Thrilled I do not have to pay salon prices for a quality shampoo  that actually works on my hair! It smells divine too! Do yourself a favor and try it! You will not be sorry !</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleans hair well yet does not dry the hair out and it gentle enough to use daily.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and skip this shampoo. It gave me dandruff and I ended up using it to clean my toilet bowl  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase much better hair products like Shikai.</li>
    <li> First use and my very fine, thin mixed Asian hair is voluminous and shimmers even in the dark. My one complaint thus far is that I would have appreciated if the conditioner also added a level of sleekness as well because my hair is also incredibly frizzy and unmanageable. At any rate, I am pleasantly surprised to see that this product actually delivered on its promises and attempted to tame my unruly mane.</li>
    <li> I recently got a free sample of this shampoo and really like it.  I like most of the things that other people have complained about.  I don&#x27;t notice or mind the moisture beads. I love that the shampoo is really thick - having long hair I feel like I can use less.  I have no issues with lathering.  I will say that when I rinse my hair after using the shampoo my hair does feel a bit dry and/or stripped (squeaky clean?).  I don&#x27;t have the same feeling with Pantene which is what I normally use (and what has worked best for me over many years).  That being said, the conditioner more than makes up with it.  It may not feel as soft after rinsing with that (compared to Pantene) but I definitely notice a difference once my hair is dry.  My hair is long - 1/3 way down my back - and this shampoo/conditioner will probably give me the patience to grow it a few more inches so I can donate my hair and still have it long enough for a ponytail.  This shampoo/conditioner makes my very old ends feel soft and not knotty. I also wouldn&#x27;t consider my hair thin or fine but I do have asian straight hair.</li>
    <li> I do not have fine hair but it is generally flat. I received a free sample of this shampoo and conditioner and both were so awful.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does not lather. I had to use the entire large sample bottle to even cover my entire head, and that was just the roots! It&#x27;s basically a cream. I rinsed it out and instantly my hair felt like straw. The conditioner was not much better. It smoothed easily over my long hair but was also drying. Throughout the day I was picking little &amp;#34;moisture beads&amp;#34; off of my scalp and out of my hair. And today my hair is so incredibly knotty that it took me about ten minutes to finally be able to run a comb through my hair without snagging on knots. I know I lost a lot of hair just trying to carefully comb my hair, and also due to breakage. I have no volume and in fact my scalp is unusually greasy today. One use and this shampoo and conditioner completely RUINED my hair! STAY AWAY! DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I do give it 5 stars :) Rarely done but I really love this shampoo. It does exactly what it claims, no nonsense!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. This is even better than the regular dove shampoo. Makes your hair soft without all the weight.</li>
    <li> Smells great..but like every other review I&#x27;ve read, it leaves moisture beads in my hair. I&#x27;ve had this shampoo for a few weeks, bought it at Target, and after using it and running my fingers through my hair I&#x27;d always hit something with my finger and think it was a bug. Simultaneously I&#x27;d be pulling what looked like glass balls out of my hair....which REALLY freaked me out. I popped one and the smell of the shampoo wafted out so I knew it wasn&#x27;t anything gross, just the &amp;#34;moisture beads&amp;#34; that all these reviews mention. I did a Google search for reviews and apparently I&#x27;m not the only person who&#x27;s experienced this. Good news is it was cheap, bad news is I&#x27;ll be throwing it away</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair and thought this would be a good substitute for an expensive shampoo I was using. It was not. After a couple weeks of use, my scalp hurt when moved my hair, it was very dry and I noticed increased shedding. A lot of extra shedding. I also found some of the beads from the shampoo in my hair after washing... Switched shampoos and the scalp pain was gone after 2 washes. The dryness is beginning to go away and the shedding has lessened. I don&#x27;t know if it was a chemical or an allergic reaction, but it was bad. Why does this have beads that don&#x27;t wash out?! Whatever stayed in my hair seriously irritated my scalp. I&#x27;ve never had this issue with any other shampoo</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this product I began to loose hair. At first I thought that I was imagining things but after two weeks, my hair was way thinner and not just a small amount of hair was falling, I had larger amounts that began to fall. I stopped using it for a week to make sure it wasn&#x27;t something I had (some kind of sickness or something), my hair stopped falling off after three days of using another shampoo. Just yesterday I wanted to retest my theory I washed off my hair and I lost a bunch of hair again. I didn&#x27;t have this problem before, ever with any other shampoo&#x27;s so I am sure that it is this product that has cause my hair to fall.  I feel sad because I had long normal beautiful hair and now my hair is thin and flat (exactly the opposite of what I was going for). I will never use this product again. They should really take it of the market and retest it, it is a bad product.</li>
