    <li> This is a lovely scent.  I get compliments whenever I wear it.  Light, and a little  reminiscent of baby powder.  It puts me in a marvelous mood for the entire day when I spritz it on.  What more can you ask of a scent?  At $30 for 8 ounces, it&#x27;s an absolute steal compared to pricey name perfumes that charge more for the packaging than the contents!</li>
