    <li> Better products out there. Just my little opinion.</li>

    <li> haven&#x27;t tried it long enough to form an opinion.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. What a difference.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I&#x27;ve been using Azure Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer for almost six months now. I love how my skin looks and feels. I&#x27;ve tried other similar products like this, but was unhappy with the results and all of the &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; ingredients. Thank you Azure Naturals for creating such a pure organic product that delivers.</li>
    <li> I like the product so far, the first shipment i received the top of the bottle was snapped off, luckily they packed it well and it didn&#x27;t get everywhere. I contacted the company to inform them of this and not only did they rush ship a replacement to me but they also included and sample of their eye serum which i like as well. so far, nothing but good experiences from this company. The products seem like high quality products, i love the packaging, they are very neutral and not female or male oriented, just very simple and clean looking. While the price could be a little cheaper. so far i feel like its a goo deal.</li>

    <li> No results but, I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;2oz lasts 3 months, I use 2-3 plumps a day (prior bed actually). I cannot know yet if it has anti-age qualities. It&#x27;s not a moisturizer, however. Use such a few minutes after applying</li>
    <li> Great product and it last for a long time. I get dry patches and this takes care of it without leaving my skin irritated.</li>
    <li> very effective for a small amt for a moisturizer</li>
    <li> Kinda of sticky but does keep skin moisturized. The vertical wrinkles on my chest disappear on days I use it. If I don&#x27;t use it, the come back and reveal my age.</li>
    <li> Opens the pores and has a wonderful orange scent. Easy to apply.</li>
