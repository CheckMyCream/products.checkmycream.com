<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;my favorite. So good.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do my hair w/o it. Love it, my hair is so shiny and healthy</li>
    <li> Pleased with the product</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product. That pretty much speaks for itself.</li>

    <li> Fast Service, Great Product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It feels so good in my hair and on my skin.</li>
    <li> My mom really loved this and I&#x27;ve ordered the 4th bottle for her.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive, yet this is a regular repeated purchase by a family member.  And if this is what she is most happy with, then it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For you fellows with beards, if someone else in your household uses MoroccanOil Oil Treatment, here&#x27;s a tip: sneak in and try some on your beard.  Seriously.  You shan&#x27;t ever use cheapo beard oils and waxes again.  ;)</li>
    <li> Great product. Got it in a week or so. Totally amazing what it does for the hair. Non greasy just healthy looking</li>
    <li> Love MoroccanOil Treatment. It makes my hair so smooth and soft.  Would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Got it for my Mom because she ran out of her first one and she lives it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It smells amazing and makes my hair soft and glossy!</li>
    <li> If your not using this you should be!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used moroccanoil oil for a while now, I use it after washing my hair and just before applying leave in. I have curly hair and the oil makes my hair feels silky and frizz-free. I love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff makes dry brittle hair look soft and think. Great for keeping split ends from splitting further up the shaft when you are trying to grow your hair out.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and was delivered quick!</li>
    <li> Amazing product being using it over 8 yrs now...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Came right away and no complaints. It&#x27;s a miracle treatment for my hair. No split ends, and it gives me soft, shiny hair. Expensive but WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> Fake product... Came in the mail opened!! Also didn&#x27;t ship a large bottle, but two, small bottles.</li>

    <li> Use this product all the time, smells nice and keeps my hair in great condition.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it every morning on my hair...as we age hair looks dull and lifeless, this restores the shine and takes away the dryness</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my 4-5 bottles I&#x27;ve been using this and I can see improvement of my hair.  Be sure if you don&#x27;t want to wait for over a month to receive the product check the seller&#x27;s profile before you bought.</li>
    <li> Price is high but works great on curly hair is the summer.</li>
    <li> Paid for a 200 ml bottle and received a 100 ml bottle.!</li>
    <li> I buy over and over. Love this stuff. I have very curly hair. I use this when I straighten my hair. My hair is so soft and smells so great. I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love! It&#x27;s kind of pricey, but well worth it! My hair is so soft and manageable after this is put on my wet hair! I use it on dry, also...especially when my hair is so dry in the summer months! Great oil!</li>
    <li> Best stuff in the world!!!</li>
    <li> Works wonders for your hair</li>
    <li> I just received my bottle of Moroccan oil today. So, I noticed on the box, and on the bottle, both stating NOT FOR RESALE ??? I have been using this product for years now, and something is off. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing. My hair feels tacky with it, when wet. On the ad, it shows a normal.bottle, without the NOT FOR RESALE on it. Not feeling good about this at all. This is very misleading. Fast shipping though...</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t start my day without this!</li>
    <li> This is the only argan based oil for hair that I use. Nothing else comes close. It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Best thing for your hair!</li>
    <li> This is real product it&#x27;s not fake</li>
    <li> Great seller; love the product; quick ship; highly recommend product &amp; seller. Five Stars!!!!! A+++++!</li>
    <li> love this stuff ! so amazing</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for four years. I have nothing but nice things to say. Everyone should own a bottle.</li>
    <li> great quality product</li>
    <li> hair looks like silk.  wonderful</li>
    <li> great oil, not greasy and also good for massage. smells clean and (sexy?) - a little pricy</li>
    <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt;Have used it for several years, never lets me down.&lt;br /&gt;The only product that smooths my waves and frizz without feeling oily or heavy.</li>
    <li> It is so great for my fine, frizzy hair.  Especially in southern, summertime humidity.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of products, but it is the best!</li>
    <li> Use small amount every evening, no matter what length my hair is this is the best product I&#x27;ve found for all kinds of weather...under scarves, hats or loose, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I love this product and the way it was packaged it was perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;Melisa</li>
    <li> Although,  I just purchased the M. Oil,  I have tried it and my hair seems very soft !  I have blonde hair, straight, and only need a dime size for my whole hair, shoulder length ! I recommend this product !</li>
    <li> Super product for the hair.  Although it isn&#x27;t pure Argon oil, I think it&#x27;s better.  I&#x27;ve tried the pure stuff and (a) it smells; and (b) it&#x27;s so thick and oily you can&#x27;t use it as a hair dressing.  This is light and non-gunky.  I recommend using it before and after you blow-dry or use a curling iron or straightening iron.</li>
