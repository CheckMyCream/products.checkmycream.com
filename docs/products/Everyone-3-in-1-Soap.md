      <li>I don&#x27;t like a lot of odoriferous products as I can easily get a headache if the smell is too potent.</li>
      <li>Tried all the scents, the citrus + mint is the very best, though it&#x27;s mostly citrus, not much mint to speak of.</li>
      <li>Then if I review this add-on and give it an excellent review, I will pay twice the price when  it will be available only on Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great scent, great soap, speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. Good smell. Lathers great</li>
    <li> i really like this product: it has a subtle citrus mint scent, and is usable for the bath and shower, and also as a shampoo. no need to have multiple products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the 32 ounce size is great, which means you get a lot of product for your dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are no sulfates, and it is a gentle product.</li>
    <li> Products great.  Buy locally.  Kept coming exploded.</li>
    <li> This smells great and works well on my hair as well as my skin.  I thought it might dry my hair out, but I can use it and skip the conditioner.  It foams up nicely and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get the job done.</li>
    <li> it seems to do the job</li>
    <li> Leaves you clean the refreshing</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Gentle on the skin and smells great and a great value.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Packaging was fine. I got the Citrus Plus Mint. Though at first, I thought it was great. Suds up really nice. After about using it for a week, I&#x27;ve come to realize that this stuff smells exactly like Pine Sol. LOL. It does a great job of getting me clean or I would like to think it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, maybe try a different smell unless you like smelling like Pine Sol. I really don&#x27;t smell any mint in mine.</li>
    <li> Refreshing fragrance.  I typically have headaches from fragranced products but this is mild and doesn&#x27;t trigger a headache.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the essential oils in this soap.  I use it for body and hair and it is wonderful.  I have dry skin and this nourishes it.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion and the soap! Wonderful scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty hesitant buying things online and I&#x27;ve been trying to be more practical and environmentally friendly lately. Great brand, paraben free, cruelty free, Eco friendly, and non-greasy. This lotion/moisturizer is amazing I have all of them except the citrus and lemon because it&#x27;s like $15 when everything else is half the price. Lavender and aloe is great for stretch marks, rashes, burns, and scars; the lemon and coconut is great for stretch marks, wrinkles, dry, sensitive, and oily skin; and the mens cucumber and lemon is great for wrinkles, post shave, and body acne ( doesnt clear up acne but helps prevent clogged pores ). All smell great and for best results use before bed</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I&#x27;ve used other bath washes like Kiss My Face and Burt&#x27;s Bees and either i couldn&#x27;t stand the scent (the former) or it was way too expensive for the amount (the latter). I think my search is over for a relatively all-natural product that cleans and rinses well, does not contain sulfates or detergents, and is at a reasonable cost for the large amount. Cheers to the makers of this product. Now I just have to try the other scents, but I love the citrus and mint!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather very well.  Just OK.</li>
    <li> Poorly designed dispenser, and I don&#x27;t like the soap. This soap is ver hard to rinse off, it leaves a &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; feeling on the skin. It takes a large amount of soap to do the job.</li>
    <li> Great quality and non-drying!  I loved the subtle fresh scent. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product for those using John Masters Blood Orange Wash.</li>
    <li> We use this for our kids.  Seems to do the job - cleaning two very active kiddos without all the nasty ingredients</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks as shampoo, body wash, and face wash. It smells good, lathers good but not&lt;br /&gt;too much, and rinses easily. I will definitely buy this again. This is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for , a safer shampoo without all&lt;br /&gt;the harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> Love the pump, easy and convenient when bathing kids!  Also love that it is a body wash and shampoo all in one.</li>
    <li> I like this soap.  It has a nice, clean scent that is not overpowering.  The amount that one gets is well worth the price.  In my opinion, much better than the standard soap(s).</li>
    <li> My boys love this smell and you can&#x27;t beat this price.  Highly recommend any of the EO products.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  Doesn&#x27; dry out my skin and my whole family really likes it.</li>
    <li> Smells good. No soap scum with bath. Feel clean and relaxed after use.</li>
    <li> Buy yourself a  scrubee, sudz it up, and wash yourself up. I use it as a handsoap as well, there is always one next to my sink in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I just got a bottle of Citrus Mint Everyone Soap; and it&#x27;s fabulous.  It has a great scent and good foam.  Although we have it in the shower to use as a body wash,  it makes a really nice bath with lots of bubbles.  Really good for kids and a busy family and an excellent value!  Highly recommended--</li>
    <li> We love this soap.  My husband and I use it as our daily bodywash.  It cleans perfectly and smells great (even to my engineer husband who is VERY particular about smells)!!!  It doesn&#x27;t dry our skin and it doesn&#x27;t turn the washcloths dingy gray or gunk them up with moisturizers.  It&#x27;s just good bodywash and we hope to continue to be able to buy it for a very long time to come.  We don&#x27;t use it as shampoo, though.  It would probably dry out your hair if used as shampoo... not enough moisturizers for that.  However, it&#x27;s still the best bodywash we&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> Love the scent and feel of this bath soap. Planning to re-order again!</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like this product but now the scent is growing on me. Citrus mint. You need to use a lot of it to spread over your body because it will dissipate and it doesn&#x27;t suds very well. I will use up the bottle I have but won&#x27;t be purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> Whole family uses it now.  Love this.  No junk in it.  natural</li>
    <li> Packaged well and arrived on time. Very good product, my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Love this product and that it is organic :)</li>
    <li> The scent was okay, but unfortunately shortly after using this product, my skin broke out in hives.  It only lasted about an hour or so, but I have never had any reaction like this to any soap or laundry detergent I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I do like many of the everyone soap varieties. I saw this one for about half the price of the others so i gave it a try.  Yes, the smell of cucumber and lemon is in fact as bad as you think. Yuck.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for about a year. It&#x27;s well-priced and lasts a long time. I use about 3 squirts on my loofah</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used nothing but this soap for over 2 weeks.  I shower twice a day, once before work and once after the gym.  My skin is not dried out, it rinses clean and smells pretty good.  Also use as shampoo and I have no complaints whatsoever.  Will definitely be my soap of choice from now on</li>
    <li> I am going to get another one of these. I like the refreshing smell and it is really good for anyone. If you are going on a trip and want something to take for everyone in the family, just pump one smaller bottle of this and let everyone share. Saves tons of space!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other reviews because I was looking for an alternative to an uber popular peppermint soap. This soap didn&#x27;t have the tingly feel but it was very nice how it did not dry my skin. The scent was very nice and mild and the size lasted a long time. I can see my self getting more soon.</li>
    <li> I love this soap when amazon had it on subscribe and save I got it at a good price but now I think I will return to driving to sprouts to pick it up.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something with citrus since it&#x27;s supposed to help you wake up. I don&#x27;t know about that but I use this for my hair and skin and it smells great and not perfume-y. It doesn&#x27;t have a ton of additives and you can tell because they make a point of printing the ingredients in big letters on the side. I&#x27;m on my second big bottle; it lasts a while.</li>
    <li> Great soap! My kids love the smell (boys) and they also like the idea that it is a shampoo, face wash and body wash!</li>
    <li> Nice soap. Use it on dog and family. big Value for a big bottle. Great product. Yes I will buy again.y</li>
    <li> This scent is similar to the cedar/citrus scent, but smells a bit better. Both smell really nice, but this one has the edge.</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff. Feel clean without the dryness and film! Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Nice flexible soap but not as thick and creamy as Alba Mint body lotion I use regularly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...This is a fabulous product. Good shampoo, shower gel and it smells awesome. But because it&#x27;s an add-on, I noticed that when we rate them &amp;#34;too good&amp;#34; they come back at twice the price on Prime. So should I review my pruchased add-ons honestly if Amazon act like that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As it is, I just paid $79 for my Prime membership and everything that I need on Prime became more expensive than last year. Now, if I want a certain product and it&#x27;s an add-on...well, I need to order for $25 from Amazon. Then if I review this add-on and give it an excellent review, I will pay twice the price when  it will be available only on Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Isn&#x27;t it the way it works now on Amazon? This is probably the last year that I pay for Prime membership. An advice to the maker of that soap (I also have the lavender lotion) : Sell on your own website and I&#x27;ll buy it. I know $9.99 is too good to be true for 32 oz of your quality product, but I won&#x27;t get hooked and pay twice the price when it will be available on Prime only. It&#x27;s very dishonest from the part of Amazon, it is a bad marketing to threat customers like morons.</li>
    <li> I was at Whole Foods to pick up a new bottle of Dr. Bronners and I saw the EO soap in Citrus and Mint. The packaging was attractive, the ingredients are natural, and the price was five bucks cheaper than Dr. Bronner. I figured I check it out. I&#x27;m sorry I did. The soap is light and non-greasy to the touch and smells nice. But that&#x27;s where the positive ends. This soap creates no visible lather at all unless you use four our five pump fulls to fill your whole hand with the stuff. As for hair, it goes in and disappears immediately and leaves a jagged pulling effect rather than foaming up into a lather that cleans the hair. I have not yet tried it for a bubble bath. But I have a feeling that the \\&quot;bubble bath\\&quot; option is the way that I am going to justify dumping the rest of this stuff out so I can clear the space to get my old Dr. Bronners back into the bathroom with me. Extremely displeased.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this soap sooo much but I just like it. I wanted something that had a citrus scent that lingered but this does not. It does however produce a fair amount of nice suds but I&#x27;ve had better. Very economical and certainly non irritating. I think that I would buy again if I had children taking baths every night but since its just me and hubby I can splurge on something more scentful and bubbly.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great as a body and face wash.  Wouldn&#x27;t use it as a shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have cradle cap and this is one of the best shampoo/ body wash I&#x27;ve ever used, love it</li>
    <li> My only complaint with the product has been the design of the pump on the bottle.  Simply put, it is a fat bottle with a pump&#x27;s overhang that does not clear the edge of the bottle.  If you attempt to apply this to a body scrub, it just does not reach enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself, is great.  I love the smell, but it could use a little more mint for the feeling.  I have not tried this as a shampoo or a bubble bath though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it as a body wash, but I love the refreshing scent---what a way to wake up!  Plus, it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This soap is perfect. It lathers beautifully, its smells fresh and light, and it doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel tight or dry after your shower. I was looking for a brand that is cruelty free and now we use EO for the entire family. I couldnt be happier with the product.</li>
    <li> Love the concept of a green soap and a single product that can do everything and replace all of the other bottles in the shower. Works great for those with short hair as a three in one product. Has not worked well for my wife or daughter as a shampoo.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for the colder months, when my skin dries out. The scent is invigorating and the soap is very gentle. As with soaps that are free of foaming agents, it is doesn&#x27;t foam. However, a pair of exfoliating gloves helps it along without needing more than a pump&#x27;s worth. My skin is clean, isn&#x27;t dry and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean my whole body and my hair, it last a long time and leaves you feeling clean and smelling great, I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Not only does this have way fewer chemical compounds than most other shampoos, but it washes out more easily from my 2- and 4-year old daughters&#x27; hair (literally half the time, as we used to dump 10 buckets of water to get the shampoo out, and now it only takes four, with one extra just for good measure). If your kids scream like mine do when getting their hair washed, you get why this is a big deal. Smells nice and is less drying to my hands than the stuff we used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great body wash for me, but didn&#x27;t work for my thick hair, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and makes all of me clean :)</li>
    <li> Nice clean scent. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This soap seems to do the job! It&#x27;s not a miracle soap or anything but its great because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my children&#x27;s skin and they both have really sensitive skin.  The only complaint is the smell... I bought  the citrus one and it smells less like oranges and more of a medicine like smell or dish liquid.</li>
    <li> We like this soap.  It lathers well and has a very clean scent.  Like that it is a more natural soap. Will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this for my hair and my body. It washes well, smells nice, and lasts (and lasts and lasts).  Great value especially compared to other natural products.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this value. The bottle is huge and lasts for months because a small amount goes a long way. The smell is light and fresh- more citrus than mint, but is a nice scent for both my boyfriend and myself. I use a little bit with a bath pouf and it produces substantial lather. I have used it a few times as shampoo when I was out of my usual and it actually worked well, without drying out my hair. I also like that it is cruelty free and it does not contain the typical detergents that tend to irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for great soap that was natural and gluten free.  Believe me even if I didn&#x27;t need a GF soap - I am so glad I bought this.  It lathers up great and smells so good.  I am going to try the other scent next time and order it to come every month.  Try it....you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of Everyone Soap - I previously purchased one of the Everyman scents for my husband since it has 3-in-1 uses for the lazy man!  I liked the scent and used it myself so I purchased a second bottle in a different scent for myself.  I primarily use this soap as bubble bath, and you get nice foamy bubbles with a citrus scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering or antiseptic.</li>
    <li> U have to use a lot of this stuf evem to lather up a wash rag. I definitely prefer dr bronners over this but i also use EO lotion everyday and will only use it</li>
    <li> I liked the soap for the most part. Smells nice.  I typically buy Jason&#x27;s body soap but wanted to try something new.  I still like Jason&#x27;s better. :)</li>
    <li> This is a good enough liquid soap. Nothing special about it, but nothing wrong with it either. It is mild and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> Love this product, The smell is mild and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. I like that it has natural ingredients. I also want to try other scents they offer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product twice and will continue to purchase. I originally stumbled on it when I was looking for the soap that the Sheraton Hotels carry because I love the citrus / mint combo. I don&#x27;t like a lot of odoriferous products as I can easily get a headache if the smell is too potent. That is not the case with this product. I was with it but I don&#x27;t feel like I reek of it. The smell is not like the Sheraton Hotel soap (which they sell a CUP [8 oz) on the Sheraton site for more than the cost of this soap).&lt;br /&gt;  I love the fact that it is made with essential oils and is &amp;#34;Cruelty free, paraben free, polysorbate free, disodium EDTA free, gluten free, non-GMO verified, sodium laureth and lauryl sulfate free&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;  The only thing negative I would say is that it&#x27;s very thin/runny compared to other soaps like this. I use a shower puff in the shower to lather and this soap dissipates a little more quickly than other soaps, so I feel I use a bit more than I do with other soaps. Despite that, I will continue to us this product because I feel the benefits outweigh the minor negative.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, the smell is amazing and goes well with Vi-Tai&#x27;s organic deodorant spray</li>
    <li> Love the Everyone Soap citrus and mint. I purchased it because my son was having skin issues with regular store brand body wash.  It leaves your skin feeling soft, and no harsh chemicals to irritate your skin. I just bought another bottle for myself.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the pump is convenient.  It&#x27;s soap</li>
    <li> This product is the same as the EO body wash but half the price for 2 times the product.  Love this!</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  Cleans wonderfully without all the nasty chemicals and additives!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and does a good job of cleaning without being too drying.</li>
    <li> This a wonderful, lightly fragranced all-purpose wash that is slowly replacing the bevy of products that used to populate my shower. I love that it provides a great lather without lots of chemicals.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Nice scent.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap, not harsh chemical anything! Smells great!  Tried all the scents, the citrus + mint is the very best, though it&#x27;s mostly citrus, not much mint to speak of.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin a little dry.</li>
    <li> Citrus mint is okay. Smells a little funny to me. I like the cedar and citrus much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product as a hand soap in the past month.  I&#x27;ve also had eczema on the back of my hands for the past 11 years (ever since I had kids and had to wash my hands much more).  I can&#x27;t believe that after a month of using it, my hands look normal again!  I like the citrus + mint scent - nice and clean but not overpowering.  I haven&#x27;t used it as a shampoo or body soap yet, but I did try it on my face and it didn&#x27;t leave it feeling dry like other soaps do.  I&#x27;m so happy that it&#x27;s now available on Subscribe and Save!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the past week as shampoo and soap.  I see what some people say that it doesn&#x27;t lather as well, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  My hair feels clean and silky and so does my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t leave that weird film other soaps do.  I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
