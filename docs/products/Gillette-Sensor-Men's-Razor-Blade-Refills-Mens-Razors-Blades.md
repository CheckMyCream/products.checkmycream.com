      <li>Nothing gives me a better shave than the 2 blade Sensor.</li>

      <li>Glad to find them through Amazon.</li>

      <li>It really takes about a month or so to make a final conclusion which is best for you and provides the most comfort.</li>
      <li>it shave&#x27;s just fine.</li>
      <li>To the Gillette Community Manager....are the handles for the Sensor (not Excel) available to be purchased?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They are of such great quality.</li>
      <li>SO I have tried every available razor from one to 5 blade, two kinds of electric the Braun and Remington and these Gillette Sensor both disposable and reusable.  </li>
      <li>light weight and not bulky.</li>
      <li>One shaved great the second pack seemed like counterfeits and tore my face and neck all up.</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;m sure no one wants that)</li>
      <li>Back to my favorite razor... 2 blades better than 5.  </li>
      <li>So I was fed up and found you could find the old products that really give you a good shave online.</li>
      <li>The double edge continues to be my favorite for many reasons - just hope Gillette doesn&#x27;t think about discontinuing this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m lucky to get two shaves out of them.  </li>
      <li>Sure, the triple and quad blades cut closer, but I also felt more stubs later in the day, but then again, others swear by them.</li>
      <li>Consistently provides a close comfortable shave, each cartridge lasts about a month...</li>

    <li> Excellent blades that last for 20 shaves. With 10 blades I&#x27;m good for 200 days!  Now due to water rationing I shave every other day so I&#x27;&#x27; now good for a whole year plus some.</li>
    <li> Great razor, good price, been using this exact product for over 10 years. See no reason to upgrade to triple, quadruple, quintuple or whatever the latest multi-blade fad may be. Be sure to buy from Amazon directly, not 3rd party, as their are tons of counterfeits out there (and yes they are selling on Amazon, not just the auction site). Gillette makes a great quality product and I get many shaves out of each blade before I have to go to the next.</li>
    <li> They are great razor cartridges! They work really well and give a close shave.</li>
    <li> Have used Gillette sensor for years.  does an excellent job where you have to be careful like around the ears, nose and lips.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing blades on Amazon and right out of the box these didn&#x27;t feel like they are real. I have no proof that they are not other than that the ones I get at the store are a different color and don&#x27;t give me ingrown hair like this one does.</li>
    <li> Glad I was able to get a pack before they sold out. I am sure Amazon will restock but I needed a pack now. Great value. Would recommend to anyone that likes a twin blade razor.</li>
    <li> Good price for good old school razors. Don&#x27;t let the razor companies (like Gillette) talk you into the high priced razors just because they&#x27;re new models</li>
    <li> Blades are a rip off compared to the retail store brands. These are black and knock off.  They last 50% estimated compared to the gray cartridges.</li>
    <li> I had bought the less expensive sensor type blades. I went back to the Gillette blades to see if they were really worth the difference. They were. When you calculate how many shaves you get from a blade better to think in terms of better shave than pennies saved</li>
    <li> Very hard to find this product, husband is happy now.</li>
    <li> 24 years using the same shaver, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of others.  This works best for me.</li>
    <li> Great price - great blades.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t meet the quality and I really want to return it and want the same kind made in USA. This Germany made makes cuts while shaving. Pls advice. Thanks</li>
    <li> The best blade out there. Getting hard to find. Husband will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> To the Gillette Community Manager....are the handles for the Sensor (not Excel) available to be purchased?&lt;br /&gt;I have used this razor for over 20 years and want to keep using it since I love it but my handle is getting a bit old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as these razors sold on Amazon are concerned, price is good but as others have noted, these are getting hard to find.</li>
    <li> Good item for the price.</li>
    <li> hard to find razor blades.</li>
    <li> I was using a cheap disposable for a few months, but I refilled my Sensor, and it feels so nice. Where I would usually not go against the grain on my upper lip, this thing does it without a hitch.</li>
    <li> What can you say about razors really?  They&#x27;re sharp, easy to install but expensive!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my S.O.  The only difference with these blades versus the ones that he had purchased at a local drug store is the lubricating strip is more narrow. So, it took him a couple of shaves to get used the difference.  Now, he says that they are just fine and are very sharp to give a close shave.</li>
    <li> My favorite blade. Going to triple or quadruple blade is useless and not as easily maneuvered into tight spaces.</li>
    <li> I bought two 10 packs. One shaved great the second pack seemed like counterfeits and tore my face and neck all up.</li>
    <li> I got the black ones, instead of grey, I think they are fake b/c they don&#x27;t perform nearly as well, I just realized this and it&#x27;s been awhile so yeah,  I got ripped off again...</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s preferred shave.  Just the right number of blades, works well in the corners near his nose.  Glad to find them through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Bees using it for 20 years. Better than the others that have 3 and 4 blades. 2 blades on the Sensor make it much easier to shape your goatee. 3 and 4 blades make shaping very hard and clumsy.</li>
    <li> I love these razors.  They are of such great quality.</li>
    <li> Blades have not been uniformly sharp, and is not as good as Sensor Excel from Germany.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Need to change product as too expensive on an outdated product</li>
    <li> High qaulity good price</li>
    <li> Despite the fact that Gillette and other companies are trying to push the consumer into buying those monstrosities with lord knows how many multiples of blades that don&#x27;t work well quite frankly (for reasons I can&#x27;t get into without starting a discussion on physics and geometry.... and I&#x27;m sure no one wants that), these babies are still the best shave you can get.</li>
    <li> Typical Gillette Sensor Razor Blade.  Nothing more or less</li>
    <li> These blades do not have the same feel I am used to with Sensor.  They do work but I won;t buy from this source again.</li>
    <li> With so many knockoffs available I feel confident about this purchase.</li>
    <li> Only buy these if price is top priority.</li>
    <li> Yep they are razors and they shave well at a great price</li>
    <li> These are not like the old blades. They are cheaper and don&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
    <li> These are hard to get in the store.  I get them on Amazon and I really like these blades.</li>
    <li> Razors, make the last longer.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his Sensor razor, and it&#x27;s difficult to find the refills in the stores anymore. These come at a great price, whenever we need them.</li>
    <li> Using these blades for over 20 years.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price</li>
    <li> Excellent product that delivers quality results</li>
    <li> Through the years the manufacturers have continued to bring out newer wet shave devices.. I was using the Gillette Sensor 2 blade for many years. I guess to feel like I was a &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; guy I sequentially bought 3, 4, and then 5 blade models. Both Gillette, Shick, and store brands. Both disposable and non-disposable. Both &amp;#34;extra sensitive&amp;#34; and not. Both with the battery operated electric vibration feature and without. And also every type and brand of shave cream (or &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;), but don&#x27;t get me started on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve got a drawer full of every make and model that you can imagine. But I keep coming back to the two blade Sensor (and not the Sensor &amp;#34;Excel&amp;#34;). Nothing gives me a better shave than the 2 blade Sensor. I&#x27;ve found that once you exceed 2 blades, the &amp;#34;plane&amp;#34; of the surface becomes too wide to make proper contact with the curving skin and it makes it hard to see exactly where the blades (as opposed to the surrounding plastic) are actually touching the skin. And think about it: Can you really believe, for example, that 5 blades really cuts more hair than 4 blades do? Or 4 vs. 3, etc.?  Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I get one full month with my Sensor blades. I think that most guys replace their blades because they just think that they &amp;#34;should&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve read where the hairs do not dull the blades (think about it: steel vs. fur, who to you think wins?), It&#x27;s really the chemicals in the water that degrade the blades. But let that pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m back to the reliable Sensor. Hey, I don&#x27;t care if newer models have 5 or 50 blades. My opinion is that it is just nonsense. Sensor is classic, honest and simple. And it gets the job done, often better than the expensive blades.</li>
    <li> Glad I found it here, the stores do not sell the razors.  It&#x27;s working great.  It was a great buy.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in retail stores very often.  So nice to have a quick and easy way to do his shopping.</li>
    <li> Still the best cartridges from gillette!</li>
    <li> Two blades are better than single blade because second, trailing blade cuts pulled out shaft of whisker for closer shave.  Two blades are also better than three or more blades (popular on most modern razors). Multiple blades are all aligned in a plane and, as the number of blades increases beyond 2, the plane area defined by the blades increases to the point that the curvature of your face becomes a factor.  With two blades, the area is small enough that you can press blades to skin and get good contact.  If you try to do this with higher number of blades you get nicked by the middle blades that protrudes into the curvature of skin.  The only way to shave with 3+ blades without getting nicked is with very light pressure.  This results in a less close shave and uneven stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Sensor blades provide the best results from a two-blade head that I have experienced.  I think it is probably their ability flex to avoid nicks.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Hats off to China.  The Gillette Sensor razors I ordered were not of the same quality as those manufactured by Gillette.  The color of the plastic is black, not gray as from Gillette.  The lubrication strip is much thinner in depth and width and does not last very long as the replacement blades I buy from Gillette.  Thirdly, the metal blade are less strong and thinner and the blades angle is slightly different so the shave is not smooth and is irritating.  The blades I buy from Gillette are very smooth and non-irritating.  Finally, you charge as much for these blades as Gillette does for theirs but your quality is way below even being acceptable.  Thank you for the rip-off.  I will send this imitation to Gillette for their comparison.</li>
    <li> Good blades, last about two weeks. Nice shave for a nice price.</li>
    <li> Always like these blades myself I have a rather thick heavy course now graying beard and these blades slice them right off with no irritation</li>
    <li> Consistently provides a close comfortable shave, each cartridge lasts about a month...light weight and not bulky.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I like this better than all the newer blades and shavers on the market. I recommend it for us older guys.</li>
    <li> Always like Gillette blades because they shave the closest without any scratching or pain.  I would recommend them to anyone who asked.</li>
    <li> In my opinion these are less irritating to my sensitive face than the Sensor Excel blades which are more common.</li>
    <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like all the fancy extra blades, they make more nicks, the two are great but they sure have gotten expensive.</li>
    <li> Back to my favorite razor... 2 blades better than 5.  That said, the proper shaving cream makes the biggest difference.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat custome for a needed item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Confused....As all men and women that use this product (and similar products) will testify, that the standard market pricing on razors, shavers et al borders on &amp;#34;criminal&amp;#34; !! - I have used this brand for 20+ yrs. It seems odd to me that when I buy this item (in bulk) from this retailer to save money, I get cut and nicked with every shave, every day.&lt;br /&gt;If I pay 20% to 40% more when purchasing in a single pack from any grocery or drug store...it shave&#x27;s just fine. There must be a quality threshold that this product falls out of to allow them to be sold at the discounted price, but it is not disclosed. I will not be re-ordering...I will shave and save money other places to justify the street price.</li>
    <li> good deal on a good product</li>
    <li> Item is easy to order online than going to a big box store.  Good quality and no issues, arrives right to the front stoop.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> No need for additional blades like other razors have.  These have all the blades that are needed - at an unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> These cartridges have gone drastically downhill.  As an eight year user of a Gillette Sensor, I really hate giving the cartridges just one star, but their quality has seriously deteriorated (assuming that we&#x27;re not being sold counterfeits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single cartridge used to last me a week or so.  Now I&#x27;m lucky to get two shaves out of them.  I finally became so disgusted that on an impulse when I was shopping in Costco last month, I bought Gillette&#x27;s Proglide Fusion Power Flexball.  It&#x27;s looking very promising - I&#x27;m still using the first cartridge after three weeks.  I&#x27;ll write a full review after I&#x27;ve gone through a few blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I suspect I won&#x27;t be using the Sensor any more.  It&#x27;s a shame.  For eight years I was completely satisfied and had no interest in replacing it, but now the cartridges just don&#x27;t last.  As an experiment, I tried the Sensor with a new cartridge after I&#x27;d been using the Proglide for a week.  The Sensor gave a great shave on the first day, a fair shave on the second, and was completely useless on the third day.  I had to finish shaving with the Proglide, which after three weeks is still shaving better than the Sensor did on the second day.</li>
    <li> Reviews on items that are not needed. Everyday item here.</li>
    <li> Very dull.Will never buy again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a woman&#x27;s shaver, I use the Sensor and these blades leave my legs feeling sooo smoothe!</li>
    <li> The double edge continues to be my favorite for many reasons - just hope Gillette doesn&#x27;t think about discontinuing this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will do my best to provide insight for people whom may be deciding to go with a single, double, triple, or quad blade design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, try each and every shaver for at least a month and compare the following:&lt;br /&gt; 1) Which shaver makes your face feel good after using it for a month. Most likely, this will be the razor you will use forever. For me, triples and Quads remove too much and leave my face feeling very dry.&lt;br /&gt; 2) Upper lip - cutting away the mustache before it occurs! Yes, some of us have hair growing right up to the nostrils and it is important for a razor to clear the way for a clean shave. Once again, the double fits perfectly - but this isn&#x27;t about me, it&#x27;s about which works best for you.&lt;br /&gt; It really takes about a month or so to make a final conclusion which is best for you and provides the most comfort. Sure, the triple and quad blades cut closer, but I also felt more stubs later in the day, but then again, others swear by them.</li>
    <li> I have used most all razors on the market, but these Sensor heads cut best--especially under the nose.</li>
    <li> So glad you had these.  My husband has been using this brand for years and we cannot find them locally.  Thank you for the super fast service.</li>
    <li> Much better than the cheaper replacement I biught earlier.</li>
    <li> quick service, good price</li>
    <li> This seems to be about the only place I can find these razors in large quantities.  I buy them on the subscribe &amp; save program and have been very happy.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head for more than a year now and I started with a Gillette Fusion Proglide.  The Proglide was great until I had to start buying the refill cartridges... Talk about being expensive!! I decided to give the Sensors a shot and see how it went.  I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between the Proglide and the Sensor cartridges when it comes to performance.  I would highly recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> Great. I have a subscription for these so I never run out.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m a sensitive guy with sensitive skin...shaving every day causes &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34;.  And I don&#x27;t like it.  SO I have tried every available razor from one to 5 blade, two kinds of electric the Braun and Remington and these Gillette Sensor both disposable and reusable.  This the brand and these are the type I use.  The Gillette Sensor disposable perform as well but really you can get 2 or 3 shaves at most out of the razor and they feel too light.  The shaver worries the disposable handle might break mid-stroke.  These beauties can handle 10 - 12 shaving days (as long as they are kept far away from feminine legs).  Please rate helpful should you find it so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for at least 20 years. They are still great blades. If you want a more classic blade (not a mach 27 with six blades and batteries that you can&#x27;t fit into small areas like your nose and lip), this is the blade. It was revolutionary when it launched with its laser cut blade years ago and still preforms better than any other traditional blade head of this type. It aint no Bic, but it is a modern generation of blade that never cuts. I think Gillette has moved the bulk of its sale to foreign countries so it can profit and compete in the blade wars in the US. Too bad because these just work. I wonder if the crazy over styled blades are whats been driving the no shave movement. If you are afraid of 6 blades at once in a large package, try these out.</li>
    <li> Going back to the past because the newer generation Mach Turbo EMC&#x3D;2 blades are expensive and don&#x27;t last but a week if that per cartridge. So I was fed up and found you could find the old products that really give you a good shave online.</li>
    <li> Accidentally bought these instead of the XL kind. They are interchangeable with the XL so they worked on my razor and I figured I&#x27;d give them a shot. I do think they are a little inferior to the XL in terms of comfort and they seem to leave a thin layer of shaving cream with each stroke in a way the XL blades do not. But they&#x27;re certainly functional.</li>
    <li> Received whats on the box.</li>
    <li> APPEAR less quality than the Gillette Sensor blades I have, in a side by side visual.  Don&#x27;t yet know how they perform.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a difference between these old type sensors and the sensor excels we have today. First shave was fine and almost as good as the excel. The second shave was brutal and I was happy to get out of it without bloodying myself. Basically a one and done deal with these, whereas I can get at least 5 great shaves from the excels. Got it for about 6 bucks for ten, so no big loss. Makes me love my excels even more!</li>
    <li> what can i say about gillete blades.they are of very good quality and i am completely satisfied.the price is high but competitive.</li>
    <li> Gillette Sensor Cartridges 10 Count&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sensor disposable razor &amp; blades are the best I have used in my 76 years. With only 3 blades &amp; shaving twice a week I have had no clogging. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The absolutely best blades for sensitive skin. My job requires I have a clean shave everyday. Having sensitive skin I need the best blades out there. I&#x27;ve tried all the other blades. 3,4, and 5 blades and they don&#x27;t last as long as these. Using anything else tears up my face due to my sensitive skin. Been using these since 97&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Cartridges received in good condition.  Do not seem to be off-spec or defective.  Shave great just like retail store purchase, and I did not have to go out to purchase.</li>
    <li> Great razor and dependable service</li>
    <li> Great deal. I&#x27;ll. Be back fore sure.</li>
    <li> The only blades I use</li>
    <li> Was and still is the gold standard of shaving!&lt;br /&gt;Been using Sensor since High School.&lt;br /&gt;No need for for headlights and 5 blades on your razor.</li>
    <li> Good price, they do the job!</li>
    <li> good blades, delivered on time.  I like the triple blade action.  The color of the package is nice i think ... wouldn&#x27;t you agree?</li>
    <li> These Gillette Sensor blades gave me a very bad shave -- rough, not close-to-the-skin, and irritating.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with them, but they are not the same blades as I buy in the store. Maybe it&#x27;s because the lubrication strip doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> Have always enjoyed the Sensor over any of the newer versions because of the number of different directions my facial hair tends to grow.  I will continue to buy these as long as they&#x27;re available and dread the day I have to change to the wider blades.</li>
    <li> In my opinion these are still the best razors out there.</li>
    <li> So far each blade has lasted for 5+ shaves without dulling. Good price, too.</li>
    <li> The razors dull quickly where they pull your face etc.  Also the edge of the razor is made such that you can&#x27;t do detailed shaving around tight areas.  These are rather expense and just not a good value.  The razor companies need to rethink their strategy of jamming as many blades into a cartridge as possible so they can charge a higher price.</li>
    <li> Does what it supposed too.  There are probably cheaper alternatives though.</li>
    <li> Really good.  Last many shaves</li>
    <li> The strip is smaller than the original gillete sensor had. Will not buy again from seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with these blades for decades. You&#x27;ll notice that even though Gillette and others keep coming out with &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; blades, these are still coveted after all these years. That&#x27;s because they are as close to perfection as the industry has come. The newer styles seem to be toys for young shavers.</li>
    <li> These blades are not up to the standards of Gillette original blades. They are not the same color or construction. I honestly could not finish one shave with these before they were so dull and completely useless. Do not buy them!!!!</li>
    <li> been using this type for over 25 yrs; price is better than WM</li>
    <li> great price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These old style blades are the best! Plain Sensor.</li>
    <li> Great razor for a great price.</li>
    <li> good blades and you cant beat the price.</li>
