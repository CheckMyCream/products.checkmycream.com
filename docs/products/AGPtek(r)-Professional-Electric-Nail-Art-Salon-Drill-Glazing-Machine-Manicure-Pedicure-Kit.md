    <li> Was broke out of the box. Returned.</li>
    <li> Does a great job. Comfy and quiet</li>
    <li> When I got the item the packaging was awful! Everything came with it which is good. However the unit where you put the drill bit was to tight. I couldn&#x27;t get them to fit. My husband took it apart and rebuilt it and it has been great.</li>
    <li> This is working very well. I am happy with the drill and the price was good too!</li>
    <li> I was excited to begin using my drill but when I received it, one of the drill bit boxes was broken. Okay, that could&#x27;ve happened in transit. The drill came with a drill bit in place, I had to use pliers in order to remove it for the actually drilling bit. After taking the drill apart, and going on Youtube, I could not get a drill piece to fit in the drill. I had to send it back. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Received this item this morning as promised. Works great. Bits are way better than I expected.  Glad I didn&#x27;t spend $ on extras.  Very pleased with my order.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter, she is a nail tech. She have not use it yet just turned on to see if it works, and so far she love it. It look very pretty and come with lots of extras, and most importantly it cones with bids. Supplies selling very few machines and you have to buy bids separate witch they dont sell in a store.</li>
    <li> item was shipped back 2 days after i got it,... not all pieces were with it...&lt;br /&gt;very sad, i really thought it was goring to be a great item to have..</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say anything about this because I followed instructions and could not get drill bit out. I had to pull out with pliers and can&#x27;t get new drill bit in. Either defective or I&#x27;m doing something wrong. I was so excited to use this too! Anyone have advice before sending it back? Would be great if I could just have hand piece replaced.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing :-( I got my drill today, read the directions and still had to use pliers to remove the initial bit, but none of the other bits fit either...sending it back tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Although it overheats and stops working, and I had to buy a second one, all in all I do like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Got the drill kit today but I&#x27;m sending it back tomorrow.  Need to have better instructions on how to get drill bits in and out.  I pull the first bit of with my teeth but I couldn&#x27;t put the new bit in.  My dad and mom and brother tried so very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Its kinda heavy and my hand gets tired after a couple fingers. The drill runs of the nail plate and cuts my skin. Maybe im not using it properly. Just seems more of a hassle than using a regular nail file.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!!! A big plus on the shipping</li>
    <li> It Sounds pretty much strong but gel coundnt put away well. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great drill!  Doesn&#x27;t vibrate.</li>
    <li> Absolutely unimpressed. Received it, set it up in the salon I work at, had a client come in and needed it to use on her nails... Didn&#x27;t work at all. Didn&#x27;t even make a sound. Very irritating to have to send my client to the nail tech next to me because my drill didn&#x27;t work. So now my clients for the next &amp;#34;however long it takes to get a new drill&amp;#34; will have to go to her to have them worked on.</li>
    <li> This works well for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product. Just as described and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful...So quiet.  Easy to use.  You get a substantial amount of bits.  Packaging was not up to par but items were all there.  I recommend this machine as it is moderately priced and a workhorse.  It doesn&#x27;t have an issue of turning off when it gets hot as some others do.</li>
    <li> Perfect high quality, very professional product.</li>
    <li> Drill was the worst money I every wasted my money on</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and the product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> At first I had a hard time getting the rod out of the hand peice and it ended up totally coming apart and tried  several times to put back together. Finally it did. I used it and am actually pretty happy with it. I&#x27;m a licensed nail tech so that is a big compliment</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for, and meets my needs.  It gives you the option of using the foot pedal, or hand held operation, which I like since I use it for myself, and use the hand option.  Does not have the power of a dremel, and has perfect speeds for using on finger nails, and toe nails.  I have an ingrown nail/toe nail fungus, and was told by my doctor to file down the nail so the medication can get through the nail faster, and work quicker. It also is much easier the reach the ingrown nail without any pain. This machine does the perfect job. I always use alcohol on the bits after each use.  Do not lend this machine to anyone, or use on another person, if you would be using it for any type of fungus.  I clean it for use by myself not to spread the fungus, and will also purchase extra attachments.  It does come with pleanty attachments so you will have pleantly of uses before needing to purchase extras.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Great, easy to use , portable,  low maintenance,  highly recommend</li>
    <li> Works well, it is being used in a salon</li>
    <li> i feel like a professional. awesome.</li>
    <li> Works great and delivery was fast!</li>
    <li> i just got my drill today and returning it tomorrow. let my supervisor test it and the first thing she asked me when using it was if I could return it. Its not sturdy enough and said it was ok for a beginner i was so excited but now disappointed but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I use this in a salon for manis and pedis. It works good, but i will be buying my own better performance bits for it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed nail technician and I LOVE this drill!! It was delivered fast and came with tons of extras!! Excellent product at an excellent price!!</li>
