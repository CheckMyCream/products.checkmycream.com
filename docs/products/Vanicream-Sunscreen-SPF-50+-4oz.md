      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t break out with most skin care products.  </li>

      <li>My Dermatologist recommended this for our family as we are out in the sun most of the year.</li>
      <li>ok, here is the deal.</li>
      <li>It looks more like cottage cheese.</li>
      <li>I am extremely pleased.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Recommended by my dermatologist and so far so good!</li>
      <li>I have always liked Vanicream products as I feel they provide superior protection from the sun, but do not like the new formulation of SPF 50.  </li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It has filled the need and more.</li>
      <li>My Skinceuticals zinc based sunscreen is good for the face, but much too pricey to use on the body.</li>
      <li>This would be the most perfect sunblock in the world if it was a tad less greasy.</li>
      <li>My very fair skinned daughter burned for the first time this year because of this new formulation.</li>
      <li>light cream easy apply would buy again.</li>
      <li>Great product, the only sunscreen my daughter can use.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread too smoothly and takes quite some time/sweating</li>
      <li>I used foundation over it and it spread smoothly and corrected the issue.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product and use it primarily on my face to prevent sun damage.  </li>
      <li>I appreciate that our dermatologist recommended such a great</li>
      <li>I used moisturizer beneath the sunscreen to help it spread more evenly; that helped but it still is gummy and does not feel good on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The ONE positive note; it did not make my sensitive skin react or break out.</li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>originally got this because my dermatologist recommended it and indicated that she uses this level of spf every day year-round.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen was recommended by our dermatologist for my son with significant eczema.</li>
      <li>If you use Vanicream, you know what a great product it is for dry and problem skin.</li>
      <li>It is nothing like the former SPF 60 Vanicream, which I loved.</li>
      <li>I received exactly what I wanted and it arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly.  </li>
      <li>Works great on my 3 year old&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This is  recommended by my dermatologist and it goes on pretty smoothly and blends in quickly</li>
      <li>Great sunscreen for my rosacea and sensitive skin - have used for years;  great price from this seller; arrived earlier than expected.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>The reason for the smell is that there are no artificial perfumes in it.</li>
      <li>All worth it for me because without vanicream every time I go out in the sun</li>
      <li>The SPF 60 version, was odorless and completely absorbed into the skin.</li>
      <li>no white streaks, blends in, no irritation, no smell, great for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>and she was right.</li>
      <li>Was super nervous about putting sunscreen on my daughter&#x27;s skin, she has very severe eczema.  </li>
      <li>Goes on easy and last for a good amount of time even wet.  </li>
      <li>We also use the same brand moisturizer and it truly keeps our skin more youthful looking.</li>
      <li>Great thick zinc type cover.</li>
      <li>starting with when my dermatologist recommended it and told me I needed to take better care of my skin.</li>
      <li>We also use the vanicream lotion daily and love the thickness and ease of using the pump.</li>
      <li>The 60 % is a lot better, the 50% my face still dry.</li>
      <li>I certainly hope I can always find this for purchase...</li>
      <li>Rubs in nicely and the white film is definitely not as bad as some other zinc sunscreens.</li>
      <li>4 stars cause it is heavy and white, but if you rub it in, and use tin tented cream on top it is fine and since I like my nose where it is, I will continue to use Vanicream!</li>
      <li>It really works.  </li>
      <li>I really like the ingredient list</li>
      <li>I can enjoy being outside</li>
      <li>It is an emollient cream that does rub well in if you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>The downside is you really need to avoid getting on your glasses because it is a challenge to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a sample from the Dr&#x27;s office and the texture is very creme and smooth,however the one I got has a glue sticky feel to it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Got this for my 18 months old who has super sensitive skin and it works without giving her a rash.</li>
      <li>If anyone has any suggestions for an oil free SPF for sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast, let me know.</li>
      <li>Main ingredients are not &amp;#34;avebenzone, etc&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It was a little oily, but I was okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>bought Eucerin Lotion with 15 SPF to use on my arms and legs and apply a little of the vanicream on top.</li>
      <li>This is meant for sensitive skin and really does stay on my face and not run into my eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of thick</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product for sensitive skin, a bit pricy but works</li>
    <li> It is a little too thick...a bit hard to rub in so doesn&#x27;t show on face, but it does keep out the sun!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery...no issues</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product.  I use it every time I go outside.</li>
    <li> Works great on my 3 year old&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have an autoimmune illness which makes being out in the sun very difficult. Despite this, my husband and I planned a dream honeymoon to Disney. I used this product the entire time I was there and never burned...not once. It is not greasy like other sun products and does not leave a white residue. I reapplied every few hours and never had issue with breaking out in my skin. There is no odor and I have started recommending it to all my friends. Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  I use on face only and below eyes.  Have to put on in advance so it has time to soak in.  Main ingredients are not &amp;#34;avebenzone, etc&amp;#34;. Not sure it is going to be &amp;#34;the one for me&amp;#34;.  Will update review if necessary.</li>
    <li> great! Water beads up on it. Baby didn&#x27;t burn or break out at all!</li>
    <li> This is  recommended by my dermatologist and it goes on pretty smoothly and blends in quickly</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist and so far so good!</li>
    <li> my son has allergic reactions to every sunscreens excepts this one. Vanicream contains no grease and very light. My son lets me put it on his skin ( faces ) w/o any fight. Thank you previous buyers to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great thick zinc type cover.</li>
    <li> If you use Vanicream, you know what a great product it is for dry and problem skin. The sunscreen I like less, as it leaves you a bit chalky and &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;. But it is SPF 50!  I used foundation over it and it spread smoothly and corrected the issue.</li>
    <li> We buy this whenever we are going on vacation.  My boyfriend usually burns whenever he is in the sun.  If he uses this, he can be out all day and not burn at all.  This stuff is awesome!  I recommend you lather it on if you are fair skinned.  It will give you unbelievable protection from sunburn.</li>
    <li> Recommended by our dermatologist. Works for our entire family!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample of this when I complained that sun screens - even ones meant for use on the face tended to leech into my eyes when I perspired. This is meant for sensitive skin and really does stay on my face and not run into my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have a sample from the Dr&#x27;s office and the texture is very creme and smooth,however the one I got has a glue sticky feel to it. It looks more like cottage cheese. I&#x27;m debating if I should return it :(</li>
    <li> The only sunblock that protects my sensitive daughter from the sun!</li>
    <li> This would be the most perfect sunblock in the world if it was a tad less greasy. But on the bright side, me and my family have never gotten sunburned when using this. And for someone who suffers from severe solar dermatitis, having a sunblock that is somewhat greasy but gets the job done is a big deal.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist after,2 skin cancer removals.  4 stars cause it is heavy and white, but if you rub it in, and use tin tented cream on top it is fine and since I like my nose where it is, I will continue to use Vanicream!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the best!  It is perfect for sensitive skin and has nothing that smells funky or that can stain clothing.... You can&#x27;t go wrong with Vanicreme for protecting your skin.  Great for use on kids and adults!</li>
    <li> I have re-orded this twice now; I use it on both my two little boys and myself.  Goes on easy and last for a good amount of time even wet.  We are very fair and this keeps us from getting any sunburn.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for my rosacea and sensitive skin - have used for years;  great price from this seller; arrived earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> No burning in the Jamaican sun.&lt;br /&gt;My entire family and I used this sunscreen on our recent trip to Jamaica. Worked GREAT...didn&#x27;t burn. We re-applied as needed. It leaves a bit of a white glow when you first apply but that fades in a few minutes. I appreciate that our dermatologist recommended such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it didn&#x27;t break an of us out. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Was super nervous about putting sunscreen on my daughter&#x27;s skin, she has very severe eczema.  She has had absolutely no reaction to this sunscreen!  We also use the vanicream lotion daily and love the thickness and ease of using the pump.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny.  The only sunscreen we&#x27;ve used for three years now.  Protects my wife&#x27;s sensitive skin and trust my kids with it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen.  It&#x27;s a little  thick but it&#x27;s worth taking the time to rub it in and wear everyday. My dermatologist recommended it because I have sensitive and unpredictable skin. I am so happy she did because I love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not buying this again.  It sticks on my hands and won&#x27;t wash off but comes off on my phone.  By the end of the tube the sunblock seems thicker.  I definitely see a white cast to my skin when I use it.  I&#x27;ve been mixing it with makeup just to use it up.</li>
    <li> I have an allergy which makes it necessary to use this product. It has filled the need and more. The only negative is the odor but you can get used to it. The reason for the smell is that there are no artificial perfumes in it.</li>
    <li> Having developed an allergy to sunscreen, my dermatologist recommended this product. It works well and does not cause a reaction. The only down side is it makes you look a bit white when applied. Worth it!</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended this for our family as we are out in the sun most of the year. It has not broken our skin and a little goes a long way. We also use the same brand moisturizer and it truly keeps our skin more youthful looking. I would recommend to people with sensitive skin. This is the first sunscreen that hasn&#x27;t broken me out. I certainly hope I can always find this for purchase...</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product and use it primarily on my face to prevent sun damage.  At first, it feels a little heavy, but once smoothed into the skin, the heaviness is gone.  I then apply makeup to my face.</li>
    <li> This cream stays on and protects better than anything we&#x27;ve  tried in the past 20 years.  The downside is you really need to avoid getting on your glasses because it is a challenge to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for over 16 year old that are out in the sun for long periods of time.</li>
    <li> Took this to the beach with me. Works great. Didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff - not one burn</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Great product, the only sunscreen my daughter can use.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly.  Good price.  We use Vanicream sunscreen for the grandchildren for years.  Excellent product.  Not filled with a bunch of chemicals.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s greasy. Yes it makes your skin look ghostly. All worth it for me because without vanicream every time I go out in the sun I develop an itchy rash all over. Vanicream makes going outside in summer possible for me. I can swim and stay out for hours and no rash appears. The SPF 35 works OK, but the 50 works best. Also, since it has no harsh chemicals, you can rub it onto your eyelids without it stinging. When you&#x27;re finished applying to your skin, wipe your hands into your hair for a little extra hair protection! Plus it&#x27;s a great skin conditioner. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Non greasy and offered great sun protection.  Great for those with lanolin allergy.</li>
    <li> stays on long time, recommended by my derm dr.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that works</li>
    <li> Very nice cream.  I don&#x27;t look like a clown in white face when I put it on.  Blends in nicely and feels good.l</li>
    <li> Got this for my 18 months old who has super sensitive skin and it works without giving her a rash. However, she turned into a white face ghost after no matter how little amount I tried to put on her face. I guess that&#x27;s what you get for all mineral sunscreens.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen was recommended by our dermatologist for my son with significant eczema. It works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
    <li> My son has very sensitive skin and he shows allergy reaction to all kinds of sun screen and this is the only sunscreen so far that doesn&#x27;t make him break out. I use it all the time when I play golf and I like it. It&#x27;s kind of thick but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> no white streaks, blends in, no irritation, no smell, great for sensitive skin.  I like it.  Good product for us.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since my son was 6 mos old. We love knowing it has none of the icky chemicals of other sunscreens and have had no problems with it keeping him (or us) from burning. We&#x27;ll continue ordering this sunscreen every summer. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> light cream easy apply would buy again.</li>
    <li> The 60 % is a lot better, the 50% my face still dry.</li>
    <li> Works well but it gets all over your clothes and it&#x27;s super hard to wash off in the shower. Sticks to you like glue.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased. I received exactly what I wanted and it arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> ok, here is the deal. my skin is very sensitive to sunscreens. Even the ones for babies,  I get small red pimples from most sunscreens, but not this one, this why I give it  5 stars. I don&#x27;t like the texture, but I mix is with a moisturizer or an oil.It is a trade off but I don&#x27;t break out. I don&#x27;t break out with most skin care products.  I always buy my skincare products without the sunscreen,</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several years (recommended by dermatologist). The new SPF rating of 50 (the max.mandated by the gov&#x27;t.)  seems just as reliable as the former, higher rating. Excellent vendor. Price was great and delivery swift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen for several years.... starting with when my dermatologist recommended it and told me I needed to take better care of my skin. It is an emollient cream that does rub well in if you don&#x27;t use too much. I&#x27;ve gotten much less sun spots with the use of this sunscreen and feel that I am taking better care of my skin because it&#x27;s a physical sunscreen using Zinc oxide. It doesn&#x27;t burn with sweating and I don&#x27;t need a separate moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Product was what I ordered and shipping was great.</li>
    <li> Really thick and doesn&#x27;t spread well. I got ghost-faced like other reviews said. I looked pasty and sick.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen that I can use that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.</li>
    <li> I add a drop of sunflower oil to make it more spreadable.</li>
    <li> It is a great sunscreen, I&#x27;ll by more for my family</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is disgusting. It is nothing like the former SPF 60 Vanicream, which I loved. The SPF 50+ is extremely gritty and chalky and drying to the skin. It smells horrible and I can&#x27;t stand to rub it into my face. It also does not work as well as the old SPF 60. My very fair skinned daughter burned for the first time this year because of this new formulation. The worst part about this sunscreen is how ridiculously white it leaves the skin. We literally look like ghosts with it on and the whiteness never goes away. Do not waste your money on this horrible sunscreen. Too bad Vanicream has no interest in bringing back the old formulation.  I guess they don&#x27;t care about those of us with extremely fair, delicate, dry skin and they just listened to people who thought the old SPF 60 was greasy, which it wasn&#x27;t. Every other zinc based sunscreen on the market is also chalky and drying, except for blue lizard baby, but that is only SPF 30. My Skinceuticals zinc based sunscreen is good for the face, but much too pricey to use on the body.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Use every morning before applying makeup.  If you have dry skin it works to moisturize as well.  Longer exposure time without reapplying as often when in the sun/water.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Having a sun allergy, it was a great relief to find a product that protects from the effects of this allergy. I can enjoy being outside</li>
    <li> I am literally allergic to the sun. After looking forever, my Dr., told me about Vanicream, it saved me! It&#x27;s the one and only sunscreen I use.  None of the crazy chemicals yet excellent protection from the evil old sun. Your skin will turn white, but it does absorb. If you are looking to protect your skin this is the stuff!</li>
    <li> only sunscreen my sensitive skin child can use.  little thick, but does the job</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why lowering the SPF number on the label required a completely new formula. The SPF 60 version, was odorless and completely absorbed into the skin. It was a little oily, but I was okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new SPF 50+ formula smells very chemically and leaves a very harsh white cast to the skin. Being a women of color, I am not happy about this. I bought the two pack and tried it on my arms, legs, feet before trying it on my face and to my surprise I had a white cast that did not go away until it was washed off. It is likely that this sunscreen works well but I cannot use it on my face if it leaves a white cast. That&#x27;s not pretty at all. I tried putting some johnson baby oil gel before putting the sunscreen on my arms and legs and the white cast is less, but I&#x27;m fearful that it&#x27;s not protecting as well. I just don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Eucerin Lotion with 15 SPF to use on my arms and legs and apply a little of the vanicream on top. I didn&#x27;t notice the white cast as much but note that I also use the Eucerin Intensive repair underneath that which is an intense moisturizing formula. At least I feel like my skin is protected, but this regimen is not for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Vanicream SPF 30 and 35 sport and a left over tube of SPF 60. I also use the Hope in a Jar oil free SPF 30 when I wear makeup as it&#x27;s less oily. These will have to do while I search for a higher SPF to use on my face for everyday. If anyone has any suggestions for an oil free SPF for sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast, let me know.</li>
    <li> The best of the micronized, chemical-free sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried!  I have tried several other chemical-free sunscreens and I like this because it is the smoothest to apply and, though it does cause a bit of &#x27;whiteness&#x27;, it is even and works well with my makeup on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;I originally got this because my dermatologist recommended it and indicated that she uses this level of spf every day year-round.</li>
    <li> Stays on through 1.5 hr swim practice.  Never burned.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the sunscreen not rubbing in all the way after reading reviews that it left a white film on your skin. We were able to completely rub the sunscreen in and it worked great!</li>
    <li> I have always liked Vanicream products as I feel they provide superior protection from the sun, but do not like the new formulation of SPF 50.  It leaves a white sheen, unlike the previous SPF 60 product.  I called Vanicream and they recommended that I use less, but that is contrary to all I read about using enough sunscreen to ensure coverage.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it was SPF 50 and for sensitive skin. Big disappointment! Ironically the product is called Vanicream; good luck in getting it to vanish. The product is gummy and difficult to make the absorb into the skin. I used moisturizer beneath the sunscreen to help it spread more evenly; that helped but it still is gummy and does not feel good on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The ONE positive note; it did not make my sensitive skin react or break out. That&#x27;s why it got 2 stars instead of just 1.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> It really works.  My dermatologist said it was the best and she was right.</li>
    <li> makes your face white</li>
    <li> Rubs in nicely and the white film is definitely not as bad as some other zinc sunscreens. Not greasy at all!</li>
    <li> I live in Miami and go to the beach a lot. This sunscreen is definitely great at preventing sunburn. I mostly only use it on my face and I always  get nice and tanned on my body but I don&#x27;t even get slightly red on my cheeks or nose. I really like the ingredient list and my dermotologist gave it s thumbs up. I dont like how white it makes your face though. Serious ghost face so only a tiny bit is necessary. It doesn&#x27;t spread too smoothly and takes quite some time/sweating/swimming to fade into your skin. When my two bottles run out I&#x27;m going to shop around for a different sunscreen but I like the brand so I&#x27;ll probably stick to Vanicream.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy probably due to the zinc, but it works well and blocks the sun.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Stays on and works well--no smell and no chemicals.</li>
