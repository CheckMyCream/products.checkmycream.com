      <li>Great deal and</li>
      <li>Love these products!!</li>
      <li>The formula has changed and not in a good way.  </li>
      <li>:) I have used Redken Color Extend for many years, and I needed a change, and this was an excellent choice!</li>
      <li>The pump is really handy.</li>
      <li>This is a very good value given the product size and the positive qualities from using it.  </li>
      <li>Leaves it feeling soft, manageable, and smells great!  </li>
      <li>For me, Back to Basics works best.</li>
      <li>I like this conditioner better than humectress.</li>
      <li>The most amazing shampoo/ conditioner I have used for naturally curly, color treated hair.</li>
      <li>It may cost more, but you don&#x27;t need to use as much of the cheap stuff and it works better.</li>
      <li>The shampoo smells nothing like the genuine Nexxus Color Assure Shampoo or Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I love the large dispensers.</li>
      <li>The prior Nexxus conditioner did so this one isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend and be sure to check Amazon for the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m waiting on the next deal to get some more.</li>
      <li>I gave a 3 because it&#x27;s a stellar deal</li>
      <li>boy, I should have read the reviews first.  </li>
      <li>My husband comments how my hair is no longer snarled post shower and how soft and full it is now.  </li>
      <li>I am a very picky consumer when it comes to my hair, and I will usually spend whatever it takes on a good product.</li>
      <li>Amazon sells for much cheaper too.  </li>
      <li>Be careful when purchasing, I bought my shampoo/conditioner at Ulta and was easily returnable at the store.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this combo.</li>
      <li>Was looking for something new....</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>dries my hair out, not the old nexxus i used in HS</li>
      <li>Nexxus shampoos have always left my hair feeling soft and silky and this one does not do anything for me.  </li>
      <li>and I am sure that these bottles would last your average single lady a LONG time.  </li>
      <li>My whole family chooses this over any other hair products.  </li>
      <li>It smells good, but it leaves a really gross residue on my roots that&#x27;s impossible to get rid of.</li>

<li> Saves us buying the little guys over and over.</li>
<li> I could not rinse the crap out of my hair, I even washed with a different shampoo.  </li>
<li> My hair felt horrible, stiff and coated, and even worse, made my ash low lights brassy.  </li>
<li> Leaves my hair heavy and greasy. :(</li>
<li> and this is fake.  </li>
<li> So annoyed!  </li>
<li> I received the wrong conditioner because it did not have a detangler.</li>
<li> Both of these products were incredibly disappointing.</li>
<li> This is the most disgusting, awful, nasty shampoo I have ever purchased.  </li>
<li> I have used nexus color assure products for years and never had a bad thing to say about them.</li>
<li> Horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> dries my hair out, not the old nexxus i used in HS</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised.  Amazon sells for much cheaper too.  If you color your hair I would highly recommend and be sure to check Amazon for the price.</li>
    <li> Great deal and I scored points with my girlfriend. I&#x27;m waiting on the next deal to get some more. Amazon always comes through.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Leaves my hair heavy and greasy. :(</li>
    <li> Second time purchased for my wife who uses this product regularly. The items were delivered on time and in perfect condition. Budget minded people will find the price very attractive. I only wish we could purchase in gallon size to refill these dispensing bottles. We will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My whole family chooses this over any other hair products.  It may cost more, but you don&#x27;t need to use as much of the cheap stuff and it works better.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair.  Went back to using previous Nexus shampoo and Conditioner</li>
    <li> purchased the promend nexxus shampoo and conditioner from this same company and I feel like the product is not genuine..  Nexxus shampoos have always left my hair feeling soft and silky and this one does not do anything for me.  I have always bought the product in the store so I will never buy online again.</li>
    <li> Recieved these leaking all over the place, with only 1/4-1/3 in each bottle!!! The box was saturated in shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner feels amazing and smells wonderful! I am a very picky consumer when it comes to my hair, and I will usually spend whatever it takes on a good product. :) I have used Redken Color Extend for many years, and I needed a change, and this was an excellent choice!</li>
    <li> We have bought Nexxus products since they were exclusively a beauty-parlor product.  I love the large dispensers. Saves us buying the little guys over and over.</li>
    <li> I gave a 3 because it&#x27;s a stellar deal and I am sure that these bottles would last your average single lady a LONG time.  However, that being said, I have thin, blonde, easily tangled hair and this specific type seems to weigh my hair down quite a bit.</li>
    <li> This is not a Nexxus product. I ordered it because it&#x27;s the one brand I am not allergic to and this is fake.  The conditioner has white balls in it and the shampoo does not lather.  The shampoo smells nothing like the genuine Nexxus Color Assure Shampoo or Conditioner.  I got a rash on my back and on my scalp.  I feel foolish for ordering this online.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong conditioner because it did not have a detangler. The prior Nexxus conditioner did so this one isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
    <li> Both of these products were incredibly disappointing. The conditioner was gritty and made my hair greasy for days afterwards. I have used nexus color assure products for years and never had a bad thing to say about them. I will not order shampoo and coditioner online again. It was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> It smells good, but it leaves a really gross residue on my roots that&#x27;s impossible to get rid of. Makes hair extremely greasy.</li>
    <li> The formula has changed and not in a good way.  This is the most disgusting, awful, nasty shampoo I have ever purchased.  I could not rinse the crap out of my hair, I even washed with a different shampoo.  My hair felt like straw and was greasy the next day.  I have never returned shampoo to the store before, but this stuff I did.  Be careful when purchasing, I bought my shampoo/conditioner at Ulta and was easily returnable at the store.</li>
    <li> Love these products!!</li>
    <li> This is a very good value given the product size and the positive qualities from using it.  The pump is really handy.</li>
    <li> It is four weeks and I still have hair color... wow!</li>
    <li> These hair products are great, I love them because they keep the color of my hair and my  highlight !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband comments how my hair is no longer snarled post shower and how soft and full it is now.  I highly recommend this combo. Previous shampoo was Redken Color Treated shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have slightly oily hair. This product felt like a film was on my hair and made it feel worse--even when I rinsed it with vinegar, it still felt coated. Gave it to a friend who has really dry hair. For me, Back to Basics works best.</li>
    <li> The most amazing shampoo/ conditioner I have used for naturally curly, color treated hair. Leaves it feeling soft, manageable, and smells great!  I gave used nexxus all my life, even as a child. (My mom was a hair dresser.) I like this conditioner better than humectress.</li>
    <li> Was looking for something new....boy, I should have read the reviews first.  My hair felt horrible, stiff and coated, and even worse, made my ash low lights brassy.  So annoyed!  Will NEVER use Nexxus again!</li>
