<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Made my hair look horrendous!</li>
    <li> I have always loved the way that my hair looks when I take it out of a braid, the waves are so pretty.  I have s full size wave iron but the impressions aren&#x27;t as deep as this one is. I love the lovely waves I get from it and love that it&#x27;s so small and compact that I can easily take it with me on a trip, packed in my suitcase and not worry about taking too much space! If you like the wavy look you will love this!</li>
    <li> Ive used this on trips, fits great in a carryon. I have shoulder length or shorter hair and it has worked fine so far.  Practice with it a few times, it is a fine line between too much hair frizz and too little 80s crimp hair.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for my hair because my hair is thick and it looked really poofy. But everyone&#x27;s hair is different but that&#x27;s how my hair reacted</li>
    <li> Its crimps more than waves. Was hoping for deeper waves. Would be cute for a Halloween party or a young girl. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> If you cant get your hair done by the hairdresser, then you must get this...totally awesome and glad to find it here.</li>
    <li> Cool LITTLE tool.  I only gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t LOVE it, as 5 stars would suggest.  I read through the reviews and decided to get this Mini one due to the fact that I have a short inverted bob that&#x27;s not quite to my shoulders.  It was said that this one is good for short hair.  Well, that it is.  I do like the size.  The entire tool from tip to where the cord comes out is only 6 1/2 inches.  That&#x27;s about as wide as the average person can spread their thumb and pinky apart.  There is no temp control, so I personally would think its too hot for childrens hair.  It gets hot in a matter of seconds.  As fast as my CHI flatiron.  The barrels on this tool are about 1/2&amp;#34; wide.  That&#x27;s pretty dang small.  I wish that someone would have written that in a review before I bought it.  It does NOT make waves.  It makes tight crimps.  Not the sharp edge crimps but crimps nonetheless.  Its totally 80&#x27;s hair.  I wont use it again.  I&#x27;ll give it to a friend for her girls in cheer.  But I WILL buy the jumbo one.  This is a great tool, works perfectly as it says, it&#x27;s just the barrels are way too small for the beachy waves that everyone is looking for.</li>
    <li> Love this waver. Bought it for my daughters and it&#x27;s perfect for them. It is very small (guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called \\&quot;minipro\\&quot;) but they have fairly short hair. I wouldn&#x27;t want to try to use this for someone with really long hair. Works for us and gives a nice result.</li>
    <li> This small styler really doesn&#x27;t create waves for me. However, it smooths like a flat iron and gives a nice curl/bend at the end of my shoulder length hair. I cannot seem to achieve that with my Chi flat iron, but it is easy with this styler. It is very small, and excellent for travel. I almost got the minipro curling iron instead, but I kept reading about people burning their hands with it. I haven&#x27;t had that problem with this one, and am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> overall this product is ok just make sure the size work for you my kid has way to much hair for this to be time efficient and an adults hands would most likely be to big to not occasionally burn your self</li>
    <li> easy to use and works well.</li>
    <li> Only giving 2 stars because I ordered on my phone in too much of a hurry and didn&#x27;t read that it is the MINI waver. I wanted a big waver for big beachy waves but obviously that&#x27;s on me! Just make sure you read the description so you&#x27;re not surprised when you open the box to find a doll-sized waver like I did! :)</li>
    <li> Love this styler!!  I have very short hair, but with length on the top and this wave styler gives it a really fun look!!</li>
    <li> Came out to be more of a crimp to me than a wave, but I still like it.</li>
    <li> Cute and functional easy to pack ,place in a drawer with just a little room.Works perfectly as described ....Just my own unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> I love this little thing!  I don&#x27;t know why some people were expecting big waves when its a mini hair waver.  I have a big waver as well.  The barrels are much bigger than this.  I have a short bob right now and this helps when I&#x27;m feeling bored with my hair style.  My big waver will not work on my short hair.  I recommend this and yes, it will make your hair look crimped.</li>
    <li> It was smaller than expected but it works wonderfully! I would for sure buy again.</li>
    <li> Perfect waves!! I have a short bob and was tired of the flat straight look. So i bought this to give my hair some volume and texture. Everyone loved it !!</li>
    <li> I gives you the effect of a bad perm. I bought this to see if t might be an easy fix to my chronically Bad Hair as decribed by a beauty editor. It wasn&#x27;t. I should really have given it an extra star, because as far as crimping irons go, I suppose it&#x27;s fine. but it&#x27;s no miracle, which is what it is purported to be in the ads.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected and just don&#x27;t like it at all need to describe more in the preveiw</li>
    <li> The description says that this will &amp;#34;create long-lasting waves with a silky smooth finish&amp;#34; but it makes tight frizzy crimps with raggedy ends.  The description says &amp;#34;the ceramic plates also reduces frizz by eliminating static in each strand of hair&amp;#34; but seriously, I tried this and it made my hair more frizzy, not less frizzy.</li>
    <li> The product works very well. The only problem I have is that it is very small. While the description gives you the impression that it creates waves, it actually creates a crimp. The product works the way it was intended. However, it is a little misrepresented.</li>
    <li> Only one ripple? Not much of a crimping iron.</li>
    <li> Easy to travel with. Makes mini waves in your hair.... Looks like a perm.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that would give me soft big waves. This product, works well, but gives your hair more of a tight 80&#x27;s crimped hair style.</li>
    <li> works well need a bigger one works good will order larger one  later very happy with this one ! !</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travel and works very well. I love it!</li>
    <li> A good value.  I&#x27;ve never bought an iron like this so really didnt know what I was looking for.  This  is a crimper and it will give you 80s hair.  If that&#x27;s what you want....you&#x27;ll love it.  It&#x27;s true to its name &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;.  I have medium length, fine hair and it was easy to handle with my hair.  It probably deserves more stars but the description lead me to believe it was not a crimper, but instead would give curls.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece who has started fixing her hair and she loves it. Easy to use and gets results. She hasn&#x27;t mentioned having any challenges using it which was what made me a little nervous getting her an electrically heated product, but it was a success!</li>
    <li> The product is ok but poorly displayed as MINIpro waver.... ITS REALLY SMALL... I dont recommend for long hair people</li>
    <li> Works good should have gotten a much bigger one for my long hair!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Heats up I&#x27;m seconds!!</li>
    <li> This made my hair rather frizzy, but maybe I was doing something wrong, so I returned it. Not for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this to wave my 4 year old daughters short hair it works wonderful although its mini so the waves are small much like a crimp. It works great for what I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have shoulder length hair and its perfect for me. I like that it is compact and does not take up a lot of room.</li>
    <li> Heats well, let labeled and well small waves as if he had done well tight braids and makes really fast. It would not be very useful for those who want wide wave in S because the barrel is very thin. Good for trasportar too!</li>
    <li> So my eleven-year-old wanted the \\&quot;Bedhead\\&quot; brand of wavers. Problem is, the price for that one is high and my kid is young with small hands. Heck, my hands are small. I knew I would be the one doing the grunt work anyway, so I decided to get this Conair mini waver. So glad I did! The price is right, and it is the perfect size for hobbits. I read the reviews on this critter a few times before purchase, and decided that people will never agree on waving vs. crimping. Crimping is very tight and geometrical- check out the pic at \\&quot;Wikipedia\\&quot;- while waves are loose and curl-like. Like, well, waves. The tools are entirely different as well- a crimper has triangular plates, while a waver has curved plates. Whether or not you want to say if certain waves are beachy or not is up to you...I think it depends on the humidity and a person&#x27;s hair. I have had minor waves and major waves after beach trips of about the same length, so it can definitely vary. I did my younger daughter&#x27;s fine hair, and my own tougher hair, and ended up with the same results. Waves do not depend on a time factor- less or more heat time gives the same results as well. For some reason, my waves were gone in the morning, while my kid&#x27;s were still present. Waves even lasted a week on my older daughter&#x27;s locks. Anyway, anyone younger than thirteen will probably get burnt using this waver. Gets hot quick and stays hot. Does not turn off by itself. Has cord and on/off switch. If pics do not help, let me know. Can redo. What you see is what you get. Go get pretty.</li>
    <li> So glad I have this it is so good to know short hair has a chance for style.</li>
    <li> it worked great for shorter hair but is not as deep of a wave as the larger size of coarse.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair super frizzed and horrible, don&#x27;t try it.&lt;br /&gt;Probably the bigger one works better. Was a waste of money</li>
    <li> Decent product for the price, but... It was too small to do my hair...and my hair length is just past my collar bone (&amp; I have thin hair)...</li>
    <li> makes very sexy waves</li>
    <li> Ehh. I gave it away wasn&#x27;t as effective as I thought</li>
    <li> I just bought this as an impulse buy at Walgreens, it was reg. $20 on sale for $15 and the last one, but see it&#x27;s $15 on Amazon too. I just tried it not thinking it would do much but it&#x27;s great!  I have a full size wave iron but the waves don&#x27;t hold as well as this one- I have long hair but layered with bangs so now can finally have the same wave effect evenly throughout my hair. It heats up quick and is heavier/studier than I thought it would be. It&#x27;s compact to even throw in my purse. It heats fast and I don&#x27;t have to hold it on my hair long to get the wave. I love the look of the wave it creates, and if I &#x27;break up the waves&#x27; with my fingers it still leaves a nice result. i used to crimp my hair in the 80s and this isn&#x27;t the same, much nicer. I&#x27;m very impressed with it!</li>
    <li> Love it. Exactly what I wanted. When I ordered I found it difficult to get a true idea of the size but it turned out be the perfect size for my short hair. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece, we thought it was much larger like the standard triple barrel straightener. It is not rated to high by her anyway.</li>
    <li> This deep waver works great for the price! If you are looking for a mini waver, this would be the perfect one!&lt;br /&gt;I am a cosmetologist and I used this on a little girl, with medium length fine hair and I was very impressed with it!&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have a lot of hair I would get a bigger one :)</li>
    <li> Nice mini waver (i have short hair) Works well so far! Makes small waves.</li>
    <li> returned after one use! It was too hot for my hair and my hair has not been the same since. I use a straightener and blow dryer a lot and  never had this problem.  It also &amp;#34;Crimps&amp;#34; more than it &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34;  Supposed to work best on shorter hair which I have, but it was crimpy.</li>
    <li> Did not like it, crimped rather than waved my hair. I returned it. Totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> It works so quickly it takes no time to do her hair. I am so glad we bought this item.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s my baby likes it</li>
    <li> This is mini they were telling the truth about that, it does take a long time to wave your hair if you have long hair, and your arm gets tired after a while, but it works.  I waved my hair and it came out nice, so far so good.  I&#x27;ll keep you updated if anything changes.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers mentioned, this is really a crimper, not a waver.  This is a disappointment when it&#x27;s marketed as a waver.</li>
    <li> Love this curler....love the way it leaves my hair....I have really short hair so the mini product works for me...  If you have long and thick hair might not work for you</li>
    <li> Works just as well if not better than bigger supposedly &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; ones I have. I actually find this easier to use given it&#x27;s smaller size and the ease of squeezing the plates together. Plus extremely handy for travel!</li>
    <li> This thing worked better than we even thought. My daughters loves it and it creates darling waves and curls. Thank you</li>
    <li> This items is smaller than I expected but it works well. Pretty good. Very good customers. They answered right away.</li>
    <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;It heats up fast and does what is expected&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for people with short hair who want a messy fun wave look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Its a lot smaller than expected...would be take a long time for someone with med-long hair to do their whole head&lt;br /&gt;I would be careful with all iron with children but this one especially the back get very hot and can be as danger as the front&lt;br /&gt;The product get so hot that it can be come slightly uncomfortable to hold even on the safety pads</li>
    <li> Easy to use and a quick set up! Great buy for any ages. My daughter loves to use it for school</li>
    <li> I just got mine a few days ago from walgreens. I have to say I am thrilled!! It&#x27;s fast and so easy to use. I have a very short bob and I get bored lol. I wanted a wavy and messy bob but couldn&#x27;t ever get it right..not very good at heat tools really and that&#x27;s why I love this thing. It took me about 10 minutes and if you flip it here and there it comes out even better. Very nice waves. Mine come out beachy looking like I wanted. Keep in mind the mini tools are better for shorter hair ladies. It will take too long on longer lengths.  They do sell this in a full size. It heats up very fast. It&#x27;s small so it looks best if you do smaller sections.</li>
    <li> mini is right, it works great for small jobs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and did not like it. I crimped my hair not waved it. If you want crimps purchase it. And its smaller than a normal envelope. I was not impressed with this item.</li>
    <li> bought this for my 8 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it!  We like the waver better than the crimper.</li>
    <li> It is pretty small, but works well. I love that wild hair look, so I love the waves this iron makes in my hair. It heats up quickly and also cools down pretty fast too. I like it better than the traditional curling iron because it&#x27;s alot quicker than making fancy curls one at a time and leaves a more natural wavy hair kind of look, but it is a crimper so if you like the deep curls then this is not the item for you.</li>
    <li> The word &amp;#34;Mini Pro&amp;#34; is exact! It is mini but works great! My hair is past my shoulders and it worked great!</li>
    <li> It works great, very handy.  The waves are a bit smaller than I was hoping for, but I didn&#x27;t take that into account while reviewing as it was my fault.  I should have paid closer attention to the size.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter and she uses it all the time. It heats up really fast and is easy to use and does wonderful waving your hair.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter seemed to like it pretty much.  She did her hair and was looking for volunteers so she could do their hair.</li>
    <li> High Quality, totally happy with this styler! I got it for my daughter and she uses it quite often! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for someone who wants waves in hair.  It heats up quickly and is very hot.</li>
    <li> yes this is small, that is why it is called a minipro. it is about the same size as the small hair straightners, it reminds me of those, and im sure you have at least seen them at walmart or somewhere...&lt;br /&gt;as far as this goes, it works great, heats up quick and hot. doesn&#x27;t snag or damage my hair, huge plus there!&lt;br /&gt;it is like a double barrel iron, which is what I wanted, I knew that was what this was.&lt;br /&gt;it does give a curly/crimpy wave, you can make it more crimpy by holding it on the hair longer/adding more heat, and then adding  hairspray ect for hold, and you can make it more wavy (and not crimpy like) by not holding it on the hair so long and using less heat, using It looser, and it will be more of a wave. the &amp;#34;crimp&amp;#34; comes out as the wavy crimp that you see a lot on tv and such, and it is actually really pretty in  my opinion, which is what I use it for, cus I love that look!&lt;br /&gt;it is easy to use on short hair, you can use it on longer hair, but yes it will take longer cus it is smaller...&lt;br /&gt;I got the small one cus I have shoulder length hair and have trouble using my regular size double barrel to get this look cus it is to big, I was so excited to see one of these in a small version,so that I can do my hair like this, even with it being shorter!&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product!!! it is great, works great and I see it lasting a while...&lt;br /&gt;please read the above though, and it may just not be for you, so that is why their is some neg reviews...&lt;br /&gt;I love it though, it is used all the time, and I also do my daughters hair with it, we  do have a regular crimper, which she likes as well, but I prefer this and this look, cus it is more wavy then crimpy!</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars because it heated up very quickly, worked great on my hair, i have very long hair and although this is a mini it crimped my entire head of hair flawlessly on the first try. very easy to use. and it shipped really fast. The only reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because, it hurt my hand to use. My thumb kept cramping up while i was using it. so maybe if the handle was a little longer, you could use your hand to clamp down, instead of just the tips of your fingers?</li>
    <li> I actually bought 2 of these: one for my daughter who just turned 10 and needs to learn to do her own hair, and another for one of her friends.  Nice, compact size - perfect for little hands or travel.  Heats up quickly, but just one heat setting.  It doesn&#x27;t have a spring clamp, so you do need to actually squeeze to make the wave - but I think I like that better than my full sized model with a clamp.  Has a nice little rubber part on the end that stays cool for easier handling.  Makes beautiful small waves, at least in my daughter&#x27;s (and my) fine, straight hair.  Definitely recommend!  Think I may order another for myself right now...</li>
    <li> The product is in great condition (because it&#x27;s new of course). The description was very accurate and I love the product.</li>
    <li> The size is great for storage and it was a great price considering that I don&#x27;t crimp my hair that often</li>
    <li> This was very good for traveling. I wish I would have ordered the normal size one because this mini is well, mini. It still worked really well and I loved the results.</li>
    <li> Great little waver. heats up quick and stays at an even temp. Bought it for my 9 year old, and she uses it very easily.</li>
    <li> This is a good little crimper. The color is fun and bright. It is made sturdy too. My only complaint is that there is not enough space to put your fingers when pushing down and you can burn yourself easy</li>
    <li> Great for shorter hair.</li>
