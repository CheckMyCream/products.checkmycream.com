### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so happy  to find it again!!!!!!</li>
      <li>THE SERVICE I RECEIVED WAS EXCELLENT AND</li>
      <li>I am going to look for the BEST fragrances of all-time, regardless of the price.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
      <li>Excellent product and great service.</li>
      <li>excellent service nice perfume</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t losts appeal and the price was great.</li>
      <li>I was with mas brothers when this cologne was introduced in 1981,It had not changed at all,This cologne is top five best colognes of all time, The price with Amazon is the best, And the sent is outstanding.</li>
      <li>It Was a really good buy ..</li>
      <li>, you can literally buy a 3.0 oz bottle of this fine stuff for $20 at any Ross store and you&#x27;re good to go so solely based on the price I thought it must not be very good...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this gem for 30 years or more &amp; it is still one of my favorites!</li>
      <li>Since my husband refuses to wear an aftershave product of any kind (unless I nag him to death), I spray it on his undershirts after folding his laundry, so he always smells yummy.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful fragrance that i wore several years ago.</li>
      <li>and I will buy more bottles soon.  </li>
      <li>IT HAD BEEN MANY YEARS SINCE</li>
      <li>IT WAS ONE OF MY SIGNATURE SCENTS BACK IN THE 80&#x27;S WHEN A FRIEND OF MINE INTRODUCED ME TO THIS WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE DURING A CONVERSATION WE WERE HAVING ON MEN&#x27;S FRAGRANCES.</li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>but i decide to bought It here in Amazon , for better price ..</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this one.</li>
      <li>The first thing I did was run a quick Google search of fragrances I was very satisfied and concurred with most of the results, but I was very surprised by what kept turning up as the &amp;#34; best &amp;#34; cologne of all-time according to many reviews:  </li>
      <li>If you are going to a party or a major event this will hold up very nicely  -</li>
      <li>And It really smells nice ..</li>
      <li>and I still enjoy this cologne.</li>
      <li>Today is the first day I have worn it for an extended period of time and I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>This cologne is POTENT and VIRILE and lasts a long time, but you have to reapply it in warm weather a from time to time to get the maximum effect.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best 20 dollars I have ever spent on cologne</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a warm, woodsy fragrance with an upper hint of citrus.</li>
      <li>A true classic never dies,as you can see!</li>
      <li>All of the other colognes I have sampled over the years don&#x27;t smell good to me &amp;amp; my wife really likes it also.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite aftershave for my husband, and the second time I have ordered it from Amazon and received it within days.  </li>
      <li>, it envelopes you and takes you away more than Christian Dior Eau Savage, and it is comes on slighty stronger than Givenchy Gentleman.  </li>
      <li>This was a definite surprise for me because I had never thought that this cologne would ever be worth anything solely based on the cheap price it goes for</li>
      <li>One thing though, it goes on strong, initially, but then (at least for me) mellows very nicely.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this stuff in a local store for years &amp;amp; have luckily found several sources on-line that can get it for me.</li>
      <li>This is a timeless classic that deserves all the praise and adulation it deserves.  </li>
      <li>but over the years I have mellowed out and aged like a fine vintage wine</li>
      <li>so now I have a new groove going on...</li>
      <li>houses first, such as Creed and Amouage</li>
      <li>If I rate this any higher every man in America will buy  Pour Lui and there won&#x27;t be enough for me!</li>
      <li>Was good only for the initial few weeks.</li>
      <li>Now im 33 years old</li>
      <li>Bought this cause my dad use to use It when i Was arround 13-14 years old ..</li>
      <li>I started wearing this when I was about 17-18 years old.</li>
      <li>I am on a new quest in my life and this is a &amp;#34; vision quest &amp;#34; unlike any other I&#x27;ve ever embarked upon in my fragrance career...</li>

    <li> Smell deteriorated in a month. Was good only for the initial few weeks.</li>
    <li> Lacked the silage and longevity that I was expecting from the cologne.</li>
    <li> so happy  to find it again!!!!!!</li>
    <li> If I rate this any higher every man in America will buy  Pour Lui and there won&#x27;t be enough for me!</li>
    <li> IT HAD BEEN MANY YEARS SINCE I HAD TRIED OSCAR POUR LUI BY OSCAR DE LA RENTA. IT WAS ONE OF MY SIGNATURE SCENTS BACK IN THE 80&#x27;S WHEN A FRIEND OF MINE INTRODUCED ME TO THIS WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE DURING A CONVERSATION WE WERE HAVING ON MEN&#x27;S FRAGRANCES. THE SERVICE I RECEIVED WAS EXCELLENT AND THE PACKAGE ARRIVED ON TIME AS ADVERTISED. I WOULD GLADY RECOMMEND THIS FRAGRANCE TO OTHERS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an Oscar wearer since I was 18 y/o, its been now 36 years and I still enjoy this cologne. One thing though, it goes on strong, initially, but then (at least for me) mellows very nicely. I buy one of these once every 2 to 3 years. If you are going to a party or a major event this will hold up very nicely  - but then again, it may not be for everyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great service.</li>
    <li> I give tt a 5 star rating due to the excitement in a woman&#x27;s eyes when she smells this on you .The scent is very long lasting .</li>

    <li> Smell like sewer water</li>
    <li> excellent service nice perfume</li>
    <li> I am on a new quest in my life and this is a &amp;#34; vision quest &amp;#34; unlike any other I&#x27;ve ever embarked upon in my fragrance career... I always had &amp;#34; the nose &amp;#34; for fragrances but I always wanted to try to buy and collect the high-end colognes from the &amp;#34; haute &amp;#34; houses first, such as Creed and Amouage and I admittingly have been there and I have done that but over the years I have mellowed out and aged like a fine vintage wine so now I have a new groove going on... you might ask what it is all about:  I am going to look for the BEST fragrances of all-time, regardless of the price.&lt;br /&gt;  The first thing I did was run a quick Google search of fragrances I was very satisfied and concurred with most of the results, but I was very surprised by what kept turning up as the &amp;#34; best &amp;#34; cologne of all-time according to many reviews:  Oscar pour Lui by Oscar de la Renta.

It is stronger and headier than Chanel pour Monsieur, it envelopes you and takes you away more than Christian Dior Eau Savage, and it is comes on slighty stronger than Givenchy Gentleman.  This cologne is POTENT and VIRILE and lasts a long time, but you have to reapply it in warm weather a from time to time to get the maximum effect.  Today is the first day I have worn it for an extended period of time and I absolutely love it.  This is by far the best 20 dollars I have ever spent on cologne and I will buy more bottles soon.  This is a timeless classic that deserves all the praise and adulation it deserves.  Buy a bottle and you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talking about.ves.  Buy a bottle and you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>

    <li> I love the scent. It&#x27;s been a while since I had a perfume but I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this one. The scent is nice and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this gem for 30 years or more &amp; it is still one of my favorites! So versatile for all seasons with it&#x27;s crisp,clean scent! A true classic never dies,as you can see!</li>
    <li> Bought this cause my dad use to use It when i Was arround 13-14 years old .. Now im 33 years old i saw this in a perfum shop in my Home town but i decide to bought It here in Amazon , for better price .. And It really smells nice .. And It keeps all day long .. I like to have a few difrent for every day  and this and ckone are the ones that keeps all day long in my body .. And i have POLO BLACK,TOUS,ETERNITY,AQUA DI GIO, so for 20 bucks It Was a really good buy .. Some people dont like the small cause It is a little bit for old people .. But everybody its difrent.. I do like a lot ...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite aftershave for my husband, and the second time I have ordered it from Amazon and received it within days.  Since my husband refuses to wear an aftershave product of any kind (unless I nag him to death), I spray it on his undershirts after folding his laundry, so he always smells yummy.</li>
