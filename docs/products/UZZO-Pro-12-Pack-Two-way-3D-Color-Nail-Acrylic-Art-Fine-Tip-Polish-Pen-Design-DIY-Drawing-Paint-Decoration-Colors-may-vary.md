    <li> How in the world do u open the pen end? I&#x27;ve used scissors sharp blades, I&#x27;m abt to just give up!!!</li>
    <li> The whole pack did not have pen tips. Only the brush end was any good.  It appeared that they forgot to put the pen tips on as once I pulled the cap, there was just a sealed bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like them! They work great for me, and I am a clutz! The only thing is that some of the tubes came clogged and i spent close to an hour trying to fix them, with no success. But it was only a couple, and the rest are amazing! So if you are reading my review to decide whether or not to get these nail pens, I would say go for it!</li>
    <li> Great product came exactly as expected</li>
    <li> over half of these were open and made a messy in the bag and on my hands I finally got tried of messing with them and put them in the trash.</li>
    <li> They came real nice and easy to use and so many different colors.  Thank You, Ilene Gonzales, Elko, NV  89801</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my pens a week now. I redo designs every few days. Nothing has ran out yet. Pen edge on sparks does not work tho. I will reorder when ink is done. Great product for at home designs</li>
    <li> the black pen works the way it should i cant get the others work i will write a better review if i can figure out how to use them</li>
    <li> All arrived in a timely manner and unopened. I did get two of the same color but other than that it was exactly what I wanted. The pen tip works great, which I was concerned about from reading the other reviews. Overall, very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> We have bought 8 of these sets in the last year !!! They are great gift we have 6 &amp; 9 year old girls and parties are happening often. So these are always a hit</li>
    <li> Some of the pens didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Works good on dry polish</li>
    <li> Has a very matte finish, pen could be slightly more fine. Also, the fake cap on one end is unnecessary and a bit confusing- the brush is not on the opposite end of the pen, you have to unscrew the top of the bottle to find it. The color selection could be better, too, but for the price it&#x27;s reasonable. At least I didn&#x27;t get any duplicates.</li>
    <li> used a lot. went fast</li>
    <li> They were only accessible one end and it was a simple paint brush no pen style as described,</li>
    <li> 7 completely non working pens, issue not resolved, very dissapointed</li>
