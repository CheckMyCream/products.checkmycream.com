### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The colors are very beautiful .</li>
      <li>Very beautiful and great price</li>
      <li>The hairclip itself, is absolutely gorgeous!</li>
      <li>Well packaged beautiful item.  </li>
      <li>now I have 104 hair clips all beautiful.</li>
      <li>These are as beautiful as the others.  </li>
      <li>but i love it!!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Gorgeous stuff,</li>
      <li>LOVE THEM!</li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with  very fine hair/shorter than shoulder length hair because of the weight of the clip.</li>
      <li>Very pretty and nice quality!  </li>
      <li>When I recieved it I was so pleased.</li>
      <li>I love the hairclip and the colors of the stones in it...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;M going to have to reattach all of these stones before the clip can be worn &amp; enjoyed</li>
      <li>ok but kind of cheap.  </li>
      <li>This is so nice, I really like these hair clips.</li>
      <li>I am going to love giving myself a french twist and then using this gorgeous piece to accent it.  </li>
      <li>Originally thought I would need 2 of these, but it is rather large and one is adequate, 2 would be one too (two) many!</li>
      <li>CUSTOMS.with the shipping of my item and the intentional misrepresentation and LACK OF full disclosure with U.S. CUSTOMS.</li>
      <li>They are easily fixed with glue, but being a hair item i would have liked not to use glue.</li>
      <li>Appears to be rose gold, the pinks and dark burgundy stones are very nicely done and are complete ended by the rosy metal.</li>
      <li>very pretty</li>
      <li>however it is a very large piece to wear in your hair</li>
      <li>Looks exactly as it&#x27;s shown in the pics and measures about 3 1/2\\</li>
      <li>I pretty much assume the lack of caring once payment is received by this seller, anyway....</li>
      <li>Comparatively this was decent!  </li>
      <li>The clip isn&#x27;t very well made, i don&#x27;t think it will hold up to much.</li>
      <li>some stones fell off fast</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely Rose Gold color with Opal looking larger stones and multi-color smaller stones ranging from purple,white &amp; pink.</li>
      <li>The price wasn&#x27;t that high</li>
      <li>My mother was like, it is suitable for thick hair high</li>
      <li>due to the lack of ANY protection for transit with the shipping of my item and the intentional misrepresentation and LACK OF full disclosure with U.S.</li>
      <li>( I don&#x27;t have a smart phone, so that wasn&#x27;t simple for me)</li>
      <li>Nice clip and stays in my thin hair.</li>
      <li>but the pink jewel fell off right after they came out of the package.  </li>
      <li>It is beautiful by is pressed to be flat,weird and a little bit broken when I receive it.</li>
      <li>the colors are pretty but mine arrived with a couple of the pink dots off.</li>
      <li>Thought the clip was a bit off center, but found that if I twist my hair and point the clip point upwards, it holds fairly well and then use a dark brown clip to hold the longer part of my hair, twisted up into a bun is a nice total look if you have very long hair.</li>
      <li>The package was also knowingly marked incorrectly for U.S. Customs as a GIFT of a  cell phone cover and an adaptor for a cell phone with the total price of $4.00 listed on the envelope sticker (which is not the price that I paid for this hairclip)!!</li>

<li> It is long but there is nothing gaudy about it.</li>
<li> &quot; long.</li>
<li> And MY clip arrived bent in the middle from weight from other packages during shipping and it also has ALL of the Opal looking stones rolling loosely in the plastic package as well as FOUR of the multi-colored stones.</li>
<li> I purchased this hairclip from \\&quot;HC-Talk\\&quot; and it took about 3 weeks to be delivered...which is to be expected for a delivery from China.</li>
<li> Nicer than expected.  </li>
<li> The packaging was not calculated to sustain any rough treatment.</li>
<li> I was able to glue them in, but that was very disappointing.</li>
<li> When it arrived, there were half a dozen of the jewels out of their settings.</li>
<li> The other items that arrived from China were absolute crap.  </li>
<li> deformed, 4 pink sheets fall off (4 out of 6!!!!)...</li>
<li> Might just be that I opened the crap first, though.</li>
<li> My hairclip was carelessly dropped into a plain small manila envelope (unpadded) and it wasn&#x27;t wrapped at all to protect it during intercontinental transit.</li>
<li> and I will assume all of these stones were knocked out of the hairclip during transit because of the lazy &amp; careless lack of protective wrap on behalf of this seller..</li>
<li> Unbelievable price!!</li>
<li> I received it today with a broken piece.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also heavy so very uncomfortable.</li>
<li> Expensive looking yet affordable</li>
<li> so, I get what I paid for :(</li>
<li> Very disappointed with my purchase.</li>

    <li> Very beautiful and great price however it is a very large piece to wear in your hair</li>
    <li> Expensive looking yet affordable</li>
    <li> its bigger than the actual picture but i love it!!</li>
    <li> Well packaged beautiful item.  I am going to love giving myself a french twist and then using this gorgeous piece to accent it.  It is long but there is nothing gaudy about it.</li>

    <li> These are as beautiful as the others.  I thought they were not coming but they finally did.  thank you.  now I have 104 hair clips all beautiful.</li>
    <li> When I recieved it I was so pleased. The colors are very beautiful . I can&#x27;t wait to wear it to work. It was bigger than I thought. I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> ok but kind of cheap.  some stones fell off fast</li>
    <li> Nice clip and stays in my thin hair. My customers and coworkers loves this clip.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and nice quality!  Unbelievable price!!</li>

I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing from this dealer.</li>
    <li> This is so nice, I really like these hair clips.</li>
    <li> the colors are pretty but mine arrived with a couple of the pink dots off. They are easily fixed with glue, but being a hair item i would have liked not to use glue. The clip part in the back was also crooked. I would not recommend or buy another.</li>
    <li> I received it today with a broken piece. It&#x27;s also heavy so very uncomfortable. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> deformed, 4 pink sheets fall off (4 out of 6!!!!)...&lt;br /&gt;unusable..</li>
    <li> Nicer than expected.  The other items that arrived from China were absolute crap.  Comparatively this was decent!  Might just be that I opened the crap first, though.</li>
    <li> Some of the jewels were not attached.  I can glue them myself, but just wanted to state.</li>
    <li> THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairclip from \\&quot;HC-Talk\\&quot; and it took about 3 weeks to be delivered...which is to be expected for a delivery from China. The hairclip itself, is absolutely gorgeous! It&#x27;s a lovely Rose Gold color with Opal looking larger stones and multi-color smaller stones ranging from purple,white &amp; pink. Looks exactly as it&#x27;s shown in the pics and measures about 3 1/2\\&quot; long. It does have a bit of heft to it...so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with  very fine hair/shorter than shoulder length hair because of the weight of the clip. I love the hairclip and the colors of the stones in it...HOWEVER, I would NOT recommend future buyers to purchase from \\&quot;HC-Talk\\&quot; as their seller. My hairclip was carelessly dropped into a plain small manila envelope (unpadded) and it wasn&#x27;t wrapped at all to protect it during intercontinental transit. No bubble wrap protection...no padded envelope...NOTHING, except for the plastic package that the hairclip is packaged in by the manufacturer. The package was also knowingly marked incorrectly for U.S. Customs as a GIFT of a  cell phone cover and an adaptor for a cell phone with the total price of $4.00 listed on the envelope sticker (which is not the price that I paid for this hairclip)!! And MY clip arrived bent in the middle from weight from other packages during shipping and it also has ALL of the Opal looking stones rolling loosely in the plastic package as well as FOUR of the multi-colored stones. I&#x27;M going to have to reattach all of these stones before the clip can be worn &amp; enjoyed and I will assume all of these stones were knocked out of the hairclip during transit because of the lazy &amp; careless lack of protective wrap on behalf of this seller..because the only other alternative is that this seller intentionally sent a customer a known defective item and simply didn&#x27;t care once they were paid. I pretty much assume the lack of caring once payment is received by this seller, anyway.... due to the lack of ANY protection for transit with the shipping of my item and the intentional misrepresentation and LACK OF full disclosure with U.S. CUSTOMS.with the shipping of my item and the intentional misrepresentation and LACK OF full disclosure with U.S. CUSTOMS.</li>
    <li> very pretty but the pink jewel fell off right after they came out of the package.  I ordered two and this happened to both of them.  I contacted the seller and they wanted photo proof. It is what it is!!!!  ( I don&#x27;t have a smart phone, so that wasn&#x27;t simple for me) I will glue them back on myself.  Be prepared though if you purchase them.  The price wasn&#x27;t that high so, I get what I paid for :(</li>
