    <li> I absolutely love this product for my hair....but, the photo for this purchase clearly shows two containers. Don&#x27;t be fooled, ready the tiny print (unlike myself), its only for 1 2oz container.  You can find it on Amazon.com for cheaper for only one.</li>
    <li> Great product which I use all the time and great price compared to the salon.</li>
    <li> they changed the formula, it&#x27;s now runny and shiney. If they were going to change the formula, they should indicated that for buyers who prefure the old formula,</li>
    <li> Great product...will continue to use</li>
    <li> Picture suggests that you are receiving two, don&#x27;t be fooled.  Package was also cracked, but no damage to the product inside.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I have been using this product for 5 years and have been very satisfied. Will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend product by \\&quot;Bed Head\\&quot;. Was recommended by our hair dresser years ago and helps in control of any hair type, as my spouse uses it also. I rated a 4 instead of a 5 because the formula as changed. Does not work as well as the old formula. I don&#x27;t understand why \\&quot;Bed Head\\&quot; thought they needed to revise a product that was great?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Now rate a 5 as the last 2 purchases are the older formula. The best part is I do not need a comb to fluff up your hair. We really like manipulatater at our house!!!!</li>
    <li> made my hair flat and unmanageable</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and just as described!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch but the Bed Head manipulator I received was not authentic.  It did not look or smell like the real thing.</li>
    <li> Everything looks the same, but the product IS NOT THE SAME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product should be sticky. This is like a cream. I am afraid to even put it in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is it so hard to be honest when selling things online?! This is crap! Hopefully they will take it back, but then I will have to pay to ship it back I am sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO DISAPPOINTED!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years but the 2 jars I just received are like they are old or something. Thick &amp; gloppy, not smooth like I normally get. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> The container was pink.  The lid was tarnished and old. The container was half open and the container was partially empty.  The contents of the container smelled rancid.  NASTY!</li>
    <li> Nice price - use this all the time</li>
    <li> When the description says/shows 2 containers, you expect to receive 2.  Unfortunately, only 1 was in the box.&lt;br /&gt;The product is great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of other products. There is nothing quite like the Manipulator from Bed Head. Moldable and great for short spikey/messy hair. I&#x27;m allergic to most parfumes. So I really appreciate the mild fruity scent.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other customers who expected 2 containers.  I did too.  Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before I ordered to realize there was only one.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product and great price !</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. After trying about a thousand different pomades, gels, and waxes, this is by far my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling too waxy or stiff. I like the way it smells, and you only need a little. I always seem to find it at a great price at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  It smells great and works on fine hair better than any other product ever.</li>
    <li> Threw all my other hair gels out...this is my &#x27;go to&#x27; product every time i wash my hair. I let my hair dry naturally and use a very small amount to style - done in a few seconds, love it.</li>
    <li> received as expected.</li>
