<li> 2x/weekly and my hair is visibly stronger with less shedding.  </li>
<li> What a mess.</li>
<li> some people are meant to have long thick hair</li>
<li> I use this stuff very wisely, a little goes along way.</li>
<li> He said that my folicls were dead there</li>
<li> The thick oil can feel a little sticky going on and can set greasy if you over use it as a leave in</li>
<li> Others have complained about the smell.</li>
<li> It does make it extremely thick though.  </li>
<li> I noticed that I had a thin patch of hair behind my ear; in about 3 weeks it was gone.</li>
<li> coming from a thinning desperate 23 year old with bad genetics and wishing of longer hair..totally works!!</li>
<li> I guess didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
<li> Every night I&#x27;d squeeze some of this oil at the base of my twist.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> fast shipping, Makes my hair feel great, just got it today so excited to see if it will make my hair grow</li>
    <li> This oil has changed my hair. I am a 48 year old AA female with natural hair. I&#x27;ve been natural for 15 years, but never took hair care seriously. I had a bald spot in the crown of my head that my deramatologist said was chemical alopecia. He said that my folicls were dead there and I would never grow hair there again and I accepted.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward it until about a year ago. I decided to take better care of my hair and became a hair junkie really fast. Most everything I bought came from Amazon. I happen to stumble upon red pimento oil looking for black castor oil. I read the reviews and most were positive so I got a bottle. I keep my hair in twists and my head wrapped most of the time. Every night I&#x27;d squeeze some of this oil at the base of my twist. When I took it down to my amazement my Afro was thicker and this was only after two weeks. I immediately ordered two more bottles. My hair is healthier as it has ever had been using this oil. I do use other things, but I attribute the thickness to the red pimento oil. I&#x27;ve gained an inch in one month also.</li>
    <li> My dreads are nice and thick thank you Tropic Isle.</li>
    <li> Tropic Isle Living Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil is a great product. It promotes hair growth and it softens the roots of your hair. It works best for me as hot oil treatment once a week. I ordered another bottle, that is how much I love this product.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for one month twice a week and haven&#x27;t received any result yet. My hair looks oily and gross. I think I am going to stop using it. I guess didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
    <li> been on this product/brand for over a year and happy to say I now expect to have a full head of hair the rest of my life. Try it yourself. Use every time after showering.</li>
    <li> I would like to recommend this product to anyone who want to grow their hair.It really works.Looking forward to order it again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helps with growth yet if would have to get back with an update.i like the way it felt on my scalp while it before washing. Nothing more that I can say until I use more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my mom, she said it was alright, i did not see any improvement. Please do not expect a miracle while purchasing this item. some people are meant to have long thick hair some aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Made a difference very quickly, hair was fuller and after a few applications I noticed that my hair grew! Very happy!</li>
    <li> its ok, I don&#x27;t feel all this tingling in my scalp that some where talking about. but im thinking it will take more the rthen just a few weeks so see the effects.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a very long time for a product to get my hair to to grow back and now have found it.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair thick and healthy.  Hard to get oil out of hair using color safe shampoo.  However, hair is perfect after second washing for up-dos and curls.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I started using this product after I did my BC. I noticed that I had a thin patch of hair behind my ear; in about 3 weeks it was gone. In 6 weeks it was non existent. I also brought this product for my mom, she also has great results. What is even more surprising is the fact that I shared this product with a co-worker, that was about 2 months ago and she has hair starting to grow on her edges; where she has never had growth before!</li>
    <li> It seems like it&#x27;s working for growth. I haven&#x27;t measured but it looks that way. Others have complained about the smell. I like it. I sleep with this in my hair , with a towel on my pillow. Washes out great, nice and silky! Love it</li>
    <li> I see hairs sprouting, just notas quickly as I would&#x27;ve liked, but MY EDGES ARE GROWING BACK:-)</li>
    <li> love love love...hair results in 2 months. Use it every other night and put cap on under blow dryer for 10 min and wash ...then start my day...11/2 in of growth...coming from a thinning desperate 23 year old with bad genetics and wishing of longer hair..totally works!! this is my second time buying this because the first 4oz bottle didn&#x27;t last almost 2 months!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any comments!</li>
    <li> One bottle was opened and it arrived empty with oil ALL OVER MY MAIL AND BOX. What a mess. The package was soaked in  oil</li>
    <li> I gave 3 stars because, this produc is to tick.</li>
    <li> I am currently using Tropic Isle Living Strong Roots Red Pimento but my hair is in a hairstyle that is low maintenance-braids. So I don&#x27;t know how my hair responded to this product. The smell is not overbearing but more so smells like Jamaican All Spice. The product is not greasy nor oily and my scalp seems to soak it up.</li>
    <li> Worked great in a oil treatment recipe I made up. mixed very well. Will have to check back with you on if it makes my hair grow faster.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair.</li>
    <li> I loved it , also its smell is very nice</li>
    <li> i think it helps with growth</li>
    <li> Great product. But do not buyit from Ameritex Linen. I bought 6 bottles for 69$ and never received them. When I asked for a refund only 9$ refunded. Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad Selllllllllllllllllllllllllllller.</li>
    <li> I like this brand. I use the oils and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bit on the thicker side but great for very dry hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m transgender &amp; my hair has grown a lot to my shoulders and my hair got thicker with Tropic Isle Living Strong &amp; I also take Natrol Biotin 5000 mcg extra strength fast dissolve.</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent and the oil consistency is a light to medium feel. Can&#x27;t rate its intended effect since I&#x27;ve only used it for about 2 weeks. But at this point, I like it.</li>
    <li> trying to grow my hair out and so far so good.has a strong smell so i put it in my hair at night. excellent price at amazon</li>
    <li> FIRST TIME USING IT AND I JUST LOVE IT! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. This is s great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still on my first bottle of this product and have used it as the instructions recommended as well as a leave in with other oils &amp; conditioners to dilute product. So far so good.</li>

    <li> I always purchase more than one. One for myself and one for my girls. I use this stuff very wisely, a little goes along way. I mix the Strong Roots with my Jamaican Castro oil and my own herbal ingredients. The results with the two and my own special mix is GOOD! I saw new growth within 2 weeks, I use this only at night before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product.  I was told that it is supposed to help with my hair thinning and hair growth.  I&#x27;ve only once since I bought it.  I will use it once a week and be patient and wait.  If I remember, I&#x27;ll get back with you with results (if I have any).</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! It works amazing in my hair. However when I received it there was oil all over the bag and much of the product was gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for one year, and I&#x27;m very happy with it! I put it in my hair before I shampoo. Sometimes I may leave it in my hair over night,or for a few hours for extra penetration which is totally ok. Once I rinse it out of my hair, I&#x27;m able to run my fingers through my 4b hair with no problems! It makes my hair very soft and strong! This is a good product to use if you&#x27;re going to get braids, or any protective style you plan on keeping up for 2 weeks or more. It does exactly what it says it does!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
    <li> Strong smell but not awful. The thick oil can feel a little sticky going on and can set greasy if you over use it as a leave in BUT it works fantastic on the scalp! If used as a hot oil treatment it&#x27;s flipping awesome.  A tiny amount will help with fly aways and add some shine.</li>
    <li> It works! I use it as a hot oil treatment 2x/weekly and my hair is visibly stronger with less shedding.  It does make it extremely thick though.  Leaves a nice sheen and my hair seems to love it.  I just ordered 2 more bottles. The first bottle only last a month.  I guess I have a big head.</li>
