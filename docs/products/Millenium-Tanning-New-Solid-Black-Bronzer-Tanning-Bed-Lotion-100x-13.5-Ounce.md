<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this primarily for tanning bed so not completely sure how often it would been to be reapplied. It is very dark but thats exactly what I want it to do. Nothing surprised me about this lotion since this is probably my 5th order from Amazon or purchased directly from tanning bed location. Love it.</li>
    <li> It works great at a very good price</li>
    <li> A friend of mine suggested me this product a couple of years back. Smells wonderful and I love how it gets me bronzed(NOT ORANGE &amp;#60;3) and tan quickly indoors going to my nearest salon :)</li>
    <li> I used it 3 times in a row and it turned me a little orange, i am now alternating with another product and it seems to be working betteR</li>
    <li> I was very happy with Solid Black. The color was good, and the texture is nice as well. It does need to be applied each time you tan, as with any tanning lotion.  The results of the lotion will naturally vary, as people do, with different skin types and colors.  I had no unfavorable orange color, with my naturally olive skin tones. I was pleased with my purchase and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I will never use another type of lotion ever again! after just once I was tan.  other lotions that have 100x bronzing always left me orange and streaky but this Solid Black lotion has the perfect name!</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion with s ridiculously low price. Just wash your hands after you put it on, cause this stuff tans EVERYTHING&lt;br /&gt;it touches! Love it!</li>
    <li> Looks legit, the packaging and everything. But the lotion doesn&#x27;t smell like anything and I&#x27;m just not getting g the results  I&#x27;ve gotten before with this product when I bought it at the salon. In fact, I&#x27;m getting NO RESULTS. I THINK IVE BEEN DUPED. SUCH A BUMMER.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I read the reviews.  It&#x27;s decent lotion.  I was expecting more of a deeper tan.</li>
    <li> love your tanning lotion the best i ever had used</li>
    <li> This product does help the red turn to a brown quicker but it stains everything. Definitely need to wash hands afterwards and apply evenly to feet and toes, and make sure it has absorbed in skin before dressing or wear dark clothes. I am not fond of the scent either.</li>
    <li> this is amazing i have fair skin and after just 2 applications and 10 minutes in the tanning bed i got a great tan can&#x27;t wait for my friends to try it out ....</li>
    <li> nice for getting dark color FAST</li>
    <li> I have used several different tanning lotions. This one is pretty good. Just be aware that it does have a LOT of bronzer in it, so you need to be careful around rough skin areas and wash your hands really well. Other than that, it worked well and I got dark quick!</li>
    <li> This stuff works, and the price is right. They have similar lotions for sale at my tanning salon for over double the price of this. The bronzing stuff works well, and it has a descent smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for the tanning bed and way cheaper than what they see.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many expensive salon lotions, but nothing takes my tan to the level that this one does with super fast results!</li>
    <li> Saw the reviews and decided to give it a try. So glad I did! I&#x27;m already decently dark, but after one use...bam! Darker!! Second use...golden brown!! Have never reached this shade without months and months in the beds. I&#x27;m just glad I was running low on lotion and needed to order more. This is something I will continually purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I am really loving this lotion.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different lotions and this one is the best by far!  I&#x27;ve even had to slow down tanning because I was getting too dark. I like the dark color it gives me and I haven&#x27;t had any streaks. I also like the smell. So many smell awful when you are done tanning but for me this one still smells good when I&#x27;m done tanning.</li>
    <li> This is simply an excellent price and quality to bring some color into your life without the risks of cancer associated with indoor/outdoor tanning.</li>
    <li> I went from using JWOWW one and done to this because it was cheaper and the reviews were pretty decent..overall I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I used it twice and gave up on it. It leaves your creases (in-between fingers and wherever else) orange..it looks so nasty. Like you don&#x27;t wash your hands..but who really has the time to wipe their fingers clean while standing in a tanning room naked before tanning? I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it...it makes you &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; tan, rather than really helping you tan.</li>
    <li> I always buy this stuff. Its awesome!!! I&#x27;ve bought so many tanning lotions and this one is my favorite. I use it with a tingle just to boost it and I get so dark. Its high some places but I like buying it on amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these and I was amazed how fast I recieved them and how good they worked.I love thos lotion It really got me dark!!! I would order this again</li>
    <li> This product enhances your tan while moisturizing your skin- and a great price.  I will definitely order more of this product.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> It made my skin look like it had an orange tint.  Had to buy a different lotion to get the tan I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Did you give me as dark of a tan in the tanning bed as expected, but as stated, it does not smell, is not greasy and does not break me out.  Did offer a slight tan when used often.</li>
    <li> Got a good tan. No tingling. Economical. Would continue to use and purchase. Strongly recommend to those who want a good tan.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and I have used many tanning lotions. It doesn&#x27;t go on oily and the smell is tolerable compared to many that go on smelling good but after tanning the smell seems to have changed &amp; you can&#x27;t wait to shower. Also my skin feels moisturized after tanning. I love this!</li>
    <li> for the price you cant beat this stuff.  It works well and smells decent as well.  I would recommend this product to any friend or family member.</li>
    <li> Stains easy. Small amounts at a time</li>
    <li> Product works well.  It has pleasant fragrance.  Reasonable price.  Would recommend.  Will re-order in future. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> After tanning in a bed with this lotion on, your skin has a really weird gross smell and i couldn&#x27;t figure out what it smells like, until I noticed streaks between my fingers from it, not happy about that at all as I thought it would actually get me to tan better not act as a self tanner. Pretty disappointed knowing that my tan that I think Im getting from the tanning bed is actually just gonna wash off in the shower in a couple of days. Worst part I got two bottles...</li>
    <li> This bronzing tanning lotion is perfect for anyone who wants to see an immediate result when starting to get that tan and if you are like me and dislike those acceleration tanners that make you itch and red.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it is great for maintaining your dark tan year round.&lt;br /&gt;I find it right for my needs.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because she goes tanning and the tanning beds charge $75 for the same bottle.  I would buy it again over and over for getting both for $25!</li>
    <li> If you like a dark tan this is the lotion / bronzer to use. The results are fantastic and quick.</li>
    <li> Definitely noticed some color after just a couple of uses! The lotion has a pretty good scent, but after tanning it stinks. Also, after a couple of uses noticed that my hands were discolored and smelled, even after washing them several times and allowing a couple of days to lapse before tanning again. All in all it&#x27;s a pretty good product...I definitely got the color I was going for, but the fact that my hands became discolored and smelled are the only things that I did not like about it.</li>
    <li> Not noticing as much change in color after using as I thought I would</li>
    <li> It works great and smells good. Doesnt leave streaks or orange tinge. I have already purchased more.don&#x27;want chance running out.</li>
    <li> tanning lotion in the tanning salons are so expensive so i decided to try this. i love how it smells and tans me</li>
    <li> Love this in the tanning bed•••I have never been so dark,  have tried others!  Will definitely buy again - great price too</li>
    <li> This product does work, I have tanned for about 5 days now and I saw a difference in the 3rd. day. A few years ago when I was Tanning I had bought a different kind of Tanning lotion my legs got a little brown, but not very much. The only con. is it will leave a couple streaks if you don&#x27;t wash your hands before you tan, and if you don&#x27;t wash it off your body after it may also leave a streak or two. (but will eventually come off)Other then that like I said great product!</li>
    <li> Be sure to clense ur hands after use BEFIRE tanning. But other than thatminor issue this product  works amazingly fast! :)</li>
    <li> this is a tanning lotion that work to acheve a dark tan&lt;br /&gt;and the smell is awsome an no after tan odors</li>
    <li> In compairison to other products I&#x27;ve purchased which cost a lot more, this stuff is great! I tan quickly with it, does not have a strong smell, which I like, and inexpensive. Great product!</li>
    <li> Was good for getting a base tan started, but I had expected it to be darker being 100x.  If you have light skin this will probably be good for you, but if you tan easily or are already some what tanned,  don&#x27;t think you will be happy.</li>
    <li> I enjoy working out and staying active.  Working out 2 to 3 times a day for a long time has helped me to be supper shredded but my pale skin makes me look like a cancer patient.  With one application under the sun I look like I&#x27;ve been hanging at the beach for a full week.  I notice that the end result is different when you tan out door vs tan in door.  When you tan outdoor and let the sun kiss your skin it makes your skin tone look a lot natural and the tanning bed&#x27;s color doesn&#x27;t look as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality product and also fairly priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a sales shark and the reason I am the best at my industry is because I believe in HONESTY.  I hate it when the tanning salon employees tell you that all the stuff on Amazon is fake.  Who has the time to make fake product and sell it for $15?  I feel sorry for these girls who gets pay $10 and force ppl to pay $60 to $100 per bottle of lotion.</li>
    <li> Bought to get a quick tan before going to Cancun.  After only tanning 6 times, I had the tan I needed.... and believe me I am a very Pale Skinned woman.</li>
    <li> This product stained my body... It left it streaked and splotched.. I am very disappointed and feel like I wasted my money... Unfortunately, I purchased two bottles.. I was excited when it arrived today and was disappointed after I used it.... Again, what a waste.... :(</li>
    <li> This product helps me tan to a darker color, but it reeks. You&#x27;re supposed to leave tanning bronzers on your 3-4 hours after tanning to ensure the darkest color possible. After just 30 minutes of this on my skin, the smell gives me headaches and nausea.</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well. I use it on my face and body, and in one tan I was a couple shades darker, on a regular tanning bed.  This is the best deal I&#x27;ve found so far. And it smells good.  These two bottles will probably last me two years. Very happy :)</li>
    <li> You should see the tan this stuff creates.  A little hard to tell, however, cause I have no tan lines.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotions its not greasy like most lotions I&#x27;ve used and the smell is horrible and it makes me pretty dark fast. was a great buy. would recommend</li>
    <li> Marvelous product!!! Applied this to my wife two hours before going to the beach. We had less than three hours of sun exposure and the next day my China white spouse had a beautiful golden brown color that lasted for six weeks. I purchased two bottles not expecting one to go very far and found I only needed one because one bottle is good for five or six full body applications. No worry because we will continue to purchase when supplies get low.</li>
    <li> I like these bronzers.  They make my skin dark, and they smell pretty good, too.  And the price is great!!!</li>
    <li> I used this last year and it is good stuff !!!! I really like it and will order it again !!</li>
    <li> It provides a great tan and doesn&#x27;t look to over the top.  It&#x27;s also very smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky like many others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best tanning products Ive used when it comes to indoor tanning lotions.  Its darker then most and keeps your color.</li>
    <li> one of my top favorites it always keeps me very dark and bronzy. no bad after odor which is a plus and its not that pricey</li>
    <li> Purchased the 2-pack for a great price savings and gave one to my daughter who never uses a tanning bed, but wanted a tan for her wedding day (the spray tan got on her dress when she did trial fitting). She used it twice and got quick results in a high pressure bed. I used it twice in a regular bed and got the same results! After 4 uses she got a little pink (I think she stayed in the bed too long). I went for 8 minutes both times with no burning or pinkness and even after my 3rd visit no pinkness.  The key is to go slow when using tanning beds! We both love this product - it&#x27;s also a great bronzer and non-greasy or streaky!</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for about 15 years on and off. I worked at a salon, I know my lotions. I am irish and very pale with freckles naturally. I am the darkest I have ever been in my life because of this lotion! And the price is fantastic! I will never buy a $100 bottle of lotion from the salon again! FYI: Try not to leave these in your car to get hot. It does affect the effectiveness of the product.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  It definitely adds to the tanning experience.  I wouldn&#x27;t tan without it.</li>
    <li> This lotion does get you dark quickly.  But I tan very easily,  so not sure how it would work on others that do not.  I can only say that it works well for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the chance to use this lotion twice so far, but I can already see how wonderful it is.  I have tons more color than I did three days ago.  My legs look great with NO STREAKING at all!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve only tanned about five or six times this month, and was working on my &amp;#34;base&amp;#34;, in ten minute increments.&lt;br /&gt; I received my Solid Black 100x Bronzer on Saturday and immediately drove to the tanning salon.  First of all, I love the smell!  It&#x27;s light and fresh.  The lotion went on nice and smooth and rubbed into my skin very easily.  Once in the bed, I turned up the music, turned on the tanning bed, and let Solid Black do it&#x27;s magic.  I loved that I didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;HOT&amp;#34; while tanning.  No heat, no tingle, LOVE IT!  The lotion is very cool and also easy to see and feel, so as not to miss any spots while applying.  I felt great afterward.&lt;br /&gt;Later that night I went out with some friends, and finally, I didn&#x27;t have to wear any foundation makeup.  I had that &amp;#34;Sunkissed&amp;#34; look!  I was actually really surprised!&lt;br /&gt; So the next night, as I&#x27;m getting ready for bed, I see how nice and golden my skin looks.  My legs have such a nice color, and I&#x27;m just giddy about the fact that Solid Black 100x Bronzer cost me a FRACTION of the price that my salon sells it.  It&#x27;s $68 +Tax (per bottle) at my tanning salon.&lt;br /&gt;Overall... I was very skeptical, (yet hopeful), about this product.  I read the reviews, took a leap of faith, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about this tanning lotion, and have normal skin, tan normally, and like a nice golden color in practically no time at all...then this is the lotion for you!  At this price, you&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose.  Even IF by chance you decide you don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;m confident that one of your friends will happily take it off your hands for you :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL be buying this lotion again!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is a great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;But I suggest to buy and use moisturizer in between tanning with this</li>
    <li> Affordable Tanning lotion with self tanning bronzer in it... Works good.  Great Value and arrived within a couple days of ordering.</li>
    <li> BEWARE the smell lingers long after you shower it off. Use hand sanitizer on hands to wipe off before tanning or you will have orange hands!!!!!! lol</li>
    <li> I thought this item shipped quickly.  I found that it smells better than some of the more expensive lotions for tanning beds.</li>
    <li> I consider this to other people because its great and works real well. I got it at a great price and it even has a great smell to it, which is what I like.</li>
    <li> Works great Thank You for speedy shipment</li>
    <li> Great lotion and great price. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pale but tan good, this product helped excelarate my nice golden tan!</li>
    <li> Love it !  Great value !</li>
    <li> I was using the 50X and ordered the 100X by mistake. Loved it enought to keep ordering the 100. I acually tan less now because I stay tan longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews, which I am glad that I did.  I have tanned for years before going on vacation to avoid burning, because of how pale I am,  but no one could even really tell I had tanned.  With this product I achieved a rich golden tan, which I never dreamed was possible.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real thing. I&#x27;ve used plenty of this same kind at my local tanning salon and this does not work the same or have the consistency. I also do not see any bronzing color like I have with the samples I purchased at the salon. :-/</li>
    <li> Got a dark tan so quick with this product! Also great moisturizer and smells so clean..love it! And a great price!</li>
    <li> Good item fast shipping</li>
    <li> I like this lotion, but I am not sure how much extra tanning I get because I use it.  The smell is not as strong as some others that i have used, which is good.</li>
    <li> Loved this lotion.. it smells great before and after tanning... I have tanned only 3 times and alreaay I have a good color... would definately buy this again</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product, but after reading the reviews from many sites I decided to go for it. When I first started using it I freaked out because about 5 hours or so after tanning my legs were streaked, pretty bad in my opinion.  Before taking a shower or anything I pulled out the lemons to even my skin tone and was nervous to try using it again.  Second and third time, the same thing happened to me.  I realized after my shower everything evened out and it looked fine, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but this isn&#x27;t something I would put on and go tanning with if I was planning to go out in shorts before showering.&lt;br /&gt;On the huge upside! I am so please with how BROWN it has made my skin and not orange, it&#x27;s not orange at all.  I am very fair skinned and have got an awesome tan now.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I currently have which I haven&#x27;t figured out how to avoid (without wearing gloves which I wear now while applying it) is how to avoid my hands getting bronzed and in between my fingers looking ridiculous.  I have tried cleaning them after applying with baby wipes and a hand towel I have tried rubbing my hands with a baby wipe and then applying and then wiping with a new baby wipe and hand towel.  It still does it to me almost every time.  I bring a pair of gloves now and just use those for applying, makes everything so much easier!</li>
    <li> It works amazingly well and 2 for $30 cannot beat that pricing. It smells nice however I do notice an odd smell after leaving the tanning bed. I would totally use this seller again though!</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for yrs. The last bottle I bought at the salon was $80. And it just was not working for me. Got 2 of these bottles that worked great to my door in 3 days for a 1/4 of the price and looks 10x better...</li>
