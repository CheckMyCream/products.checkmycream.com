<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it more hot than this but it&#x27;s fine. Order came fast. thank you</li>
    <li> Good Stuff...!! Had a buddy recommend it and I must say you can&#x27;t beat it for the price...!! And smells good to..!!</li>
    <li> love this product will use it again</li>
    <li> Definitely a great product, I have spent the extra $$$ on a fancy lotion before, this one is a bargain and a great product. No tingle, great gradual bronze, mine showed up in just 3 sessions using this lotion. Come on, you won&#x27;t be disappointed! !!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion. ..smells really good</li>
    <li> My fav tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> It seems like this has a fake tanner in it. If you don&#x27;t wash your hands after putting it on your hands will turn orange.</li>
    <li> It rubs off on your towel when you shower.</li>
    <li> A+++++++ GREAT BRONZER .... BE SURE TO WASH IT OFF YOUR HANDS AFTER TANNING OTHERWISE IT WILL BE THERE FOR A DAY OR SO BUT GREAT COLOR LOVE IT !!! CANT BE BEAT FOR THE PRICE !!!</li>
    <li> PROS: -Arrived way before expected -Smells INCREDIBLY UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING before, during, and even after tanning -Definitely improved my tan after ONE ten minute tanning session (I&#x27;ve tanned for four years, and never had these results)  CONS: -Left a dark orange stain in between each finger...not my whole hand...or even anywhere else on my body...just in between my fingers  I&#x27;m considering wearing gloves to apply...that&#x27;s how much I love this stuff. This is the first and only review I have EVER written. Love love love this lotion!!!</li>
    <li> After trying several different tanning lotions from a tanning salon, I decided to try this. This lotion is top notch! I love it!</li>
    <li> The coloring of the lotion inside the bottle was completely different from the coloring that the tanning salons lotion was. They informed me that many people that sell online sell expired lotions or put cheap lotions in an expensive lotions bottle. I did not get what a paid for.</li>
    <li> im usually not a fast tanner, but this lotion works extremely well!!! It is a bronzer, so for best results wait a few hours before you shower. I typically tan in the morning and then use a moisturizer to cover the after spell that all tanning lotions have (my favorite is the angel brand)</li>
    <li> Great product as described, works really well, overall very satisfied with my purchase. I would recommend this tanning lotion! Great deal....</li>
    <li> got a wonderful broze tan in just 3 weeks , arrived early love it</li>
    <li> Shipping was really fast! I noticed color right away, and smelled great too! I would wipe your hands and fingers to prevent streak-age though. Overall great product and I would by again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and ones like it for years. My skin feels smooth after use and the bronzer does not get on my clothes.  Love it</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is not worth it, I look orange, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
    <li> This lotion works great, you can see results after 1 use. Be sure to wash your hands after, or take a towel and wipe palms of hands and in-between fingers. I noticed if you don&#x27;t do that, some of the bronzer is left on your hands/fingers.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this! It is awful! Leaves your palms orange and it doesn&#x27;t nothing for my color! I think I was ripped off and got cheap self tanner!</li>
    <li> I used it once and already look and feel darker..it smells good only downside is that after u tan it begins to smell like a self tanner and I personally am not too fond of that smell..overall satisfied!</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the lotion and the smell. But there&#x27;s so much bronzer in it that I felt like parts of my body were thrnkng a little orange. Anthem every time I showered (even many hours after I went tanning) the tan that I had built had all washed off so it was like I was starting over every time I went to the salon. I used it a few times, and may use it once in a while but I switched to a different lotion.</li>
    <li> I was able to see visible results after the first tanning session. Exellent product, worked very well in my opinion</li>
    <li> Helps you tan 194638 times quicker!!!</li>
    <li> Obviously I made a huge mistake in thinking 100 times darkening bronzer was would make you darker quicker than a 50 times dark tanning bronzer........ Boy was I WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;  I DID PURCHASE THE MILLENNIUM TANNING 100Xs  SOLID BLACK BRONZER TANNING LOTION.  It was my impression, that a 100Xs dark tanning bronzer is supposed to give you more darkness than a 50 Xs bronzer?  Why is this not the case with this particular 100 times dark bronzer?  Does anyone know of any REAL 100Xs dark tanning?  Oh, I read many of the comments stating that the millennium 100 times darker bronzer smells so good and doesn&#x27;t leave the afterburn smell?  What the heck? Where are these people&#x27;s sense of smell or did I get one of those scammed, old solid black bottles or perhaps somebody poured a different type of lotion in the damn bottle and calls it 100Xs dark tanning bronzer. Anyhow, if I  did get the real deal Millenium 100Xs DARKTANNING BRONZER then I completely disagree with those people that state that it has a great smell before &amp; after, after one tanning bed session your skin is two times darker, and again maybe I am disillusioned but I had thought  that 100 times would be more potent than 50Xs? What a great disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;  The only positive I will say about the solid black 100 times dark tanning bronzer is it has not left orange streaks nor orange tint on my hands or body!&lt;br /&gt;  I will never purchase some shit like this again!&lt;br /&gt;  Again, I will ask anyone who reads this- Do you know of a AWESOME&amp; TRUE to its word of a 100Xs or greater than 100Xs  dark tanning BRONZER(NOT A TINGLE) that actually gets you shades darker &amp; within 1-3 sessions than does a 50Xs bronzer?  I can very easily and I can to get very very dark especially outdoors that is where the best tan comes for me; However, I would never use indoor tanning bed lotion when I am outside cutting grass or doing something outdoors.  I have always been a fan of Banana Boat Darking Tanning Oil w/ 0 SUNSCREEN PROTECTION (of course).  I sure do miss having the time and the swimming pool to lay out in the sun. I had much rather be outdoors getting a real tan than inside a building getting an indoor tan!  Indoor tanning beds serve my skin little justice of just how deep and dark I can get that don&#x27;t show my full potential of 10</li>
    <li> This stuff gets dark people darker!  If you&#x27;ve reached your plateau, the will put u beyond that!  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite tanning lotion. I&#x27;ve gone through one bottle and ordered my second. i recommend this lotion to everyone and get many compliments on how dark I am.</li>
    <li> Okay lotion, super sticky and leaves fingers stained for days! Stopped using and gave it away at the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Works great. Perfect compliment to the Black Storm tanning lotion. It gives you a really nice gingerbread kind of look</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some of the other lotions, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Working out so far or me, I&#x27;m getting a great base color.</li>
    <li> After only a couple of uses, I could tell the difference! Works great!</li>
    <li> Good stuff did the job. This was my first time tanning and needless to say I was white and don&#x27;t really tan well I was the type to get red and than white again and when I use this lotion I actually turned into a real tan.</li>
    <li> Great product. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that for an item rated so highly the end result was very streaky and uneven- I didnt feel like it was very moisturizing at all</li>
    <li> This stuff will leave you dark! However, it has a slight little smell, a good smell, when applying it.... But you will smell like burnt flesh afterwards over time. I would suggest that you plan on showering not too long after a tanning session. I&#x27;m not sure why people are saying it leaves streaks or leaves your hands orange. The only way that is going to happen is if you don&#x27;t completely rub it in. I don&#x27;t see why you wouldn&#x27;t in the first place! I would recommend if you are aiming for a really nice dark tan, just prepare for the smell afterwards. 5 stars if they can make this smell better.</li>
    <li> For a cheap tanning lotion it works. Smells good, but just leaves your hands orange. I would say wipe them off right after applying.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I ordered and it was brand new even though people had warned me about ordering this through amazon - I&#x27;m completely happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This was a tiny step down from the 50x. The 50 gives better color, smells way better, and doesn&#x27;t make you want to immediately shower. This lotion does give  a slightly deeper color but not much different. Its fine, but the 50 is better.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this tanning lotion but honestly, it sucked. It didn&#x27;t hold a tan and the tan it did hold, it made me turn slightly orange.</li>
    <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t pay tanning salon prices for lotion, unless you really like the girls working there and want to help them out with their commission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion works and smells great and is a small fraction of the retail price at salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already had a solid base tan when I started using this, so I can&#x27;t say how fast it will get you tan. It has done great maintaining mine though as I slowly get darker and darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews, and they&#x27;re all right! It definitely works really well, except it smells awful on my body after a tanning session. It looks best about 12 hours after a tan, so be patient! Also, it has some bronzers in it, so be sure to shower the next day to get the excess bronzer off!</li>
    <li> I broke out in hives all over my butt after using this product. I left it at the tanning salon after my sessions were over. A waist of money.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I have always been one to take forever to loo bronze even when I am tanning daily.. not this summer! I was nice and tan in time for vacation! This stuff really works! I will DEF be buying it again!!!</li>
    <li> I had already had a tan, I have cherokee, and blackfoot origins.  This brings out the darkest tan ever. I get so many compliments on my tan. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Great price, great delivery and I love this lotion!! It smells amazing and it has lots of bronze so you will get darker faster :)</li>
    <li> Could tell a difference compared to other lotions. Works well. Much darker. Will buy again when I have ran out</li>
    <li> Great bargain for the buy!</li>
    <li> Exactly what this seller said it is and does !!! I&#x27;m getting more from this seller... Bring on the beach now, Everyone thinks I&#x27;m from Brazil and I have this seller to thank for this !!! For use in tanning booths and beds only. Please, don&#x27;t try in direct sun at the beach... Read Bottle Cautions.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion! Gave me a great dark color and smells so good! I used it as regular lotion in between tanning sessions to give me a bronze color. Great lotion for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a total of 6 bottles of this over the past year and a half and it is very consistent and works well.</li>
    <li> Gets you dark but the smell isn&#x27;t great at all.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth the money and I will definitely purchase it again in the near future for a nice color.</li>
    <li> Great bronzer! Smell...not great.  But for this price you really can&#x27;t beat it! Lotion was nice and thick, not runny and no streaking!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really tan enough to really know the difference between all of the different lotions, but I have had great results with this product.</li>
    <li> like it, it works well! only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t specifically say indoor tanning so occasionally at my tanning place where they require the use of &amp;#34;indoor tanning products only&amp;#34;, i get a picky worker who questions me on it.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS and last for days! I don&#x27;t even think you have to go tanning to use this product because it has bronzer in it.</li>
    <li> Great product great service</li>
    <li> This smells so good and after tanning, you get really nice, even color!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is awesome.  It makes my skin feel silky smooth.  I did not know however that there is a bronzer in it to deepen your tan so be careful around your knees and ankles.</li>
    <li> Saw the reviews and decided to order it. I love the tan it gives me in one session!</li>
    <li> Wife purchased this item. The smell is Orchid Blush and bothers her. She also said it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Took bath 12 hours after tanning at salon, color seemed to just wash off and was a waste. Used item 3 times and same thing happened every time. A complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> i used it once and loved it, i use to buy taning salon lotions, i will never do that again</li>
    <li> I like it, it gives you a nice color tan</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I absoultely Love how dark it gets u &amp; this lotion smells so good!!! This product is highly recommended...</li>
    <li> i do love it has great scent and great coverage makes skin fill smooth i will get more thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to try because it was inexpensive.  The color results are ok - I do see color the very first time I tan.  I DO NOT like the order it leaves on my hands.  My hands smell and it lasts for days.  The bottle recommends to wash your hands after you apply the lotion - however - that is impossible if you are tanning in a salon like I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this product again because I don&#x27;t like the smell of my hands after I apply the lotion.</li>
    <li> Gives an orangeish look. Dont like it. Smells nice though and feels good going on. I bern using a different lotion that I ran out of and reviews on this were great so I thought Id try it. Wont be buying it again though</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! After a few uses I could deff tell a difference. But if you don&#x27;t wash your hands after your apply it.. THEYY WILL TURN ORANGE! Lol and I love the smell. This is my 3rd time getting it!</li>
    <li> I had been going 2-3 times a week to a tanning bed with a product I had purchased from the salon.  I noticed I was not tanning as usual.  With the first use of the Solid Black- my tan was improved immensely!  Beautiful golden brown and glowing!  I get so many compliments on the color of my tan.  This lotion is silicon based and has a bronzer.  I am sold on Solid Black 100X.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review about Paint It Black also my Millenium Tanning, and Solid Black is basically the exact same product in a slightly different bottle. Both products make your skin feel like silk post tan, BUT as soon as you take a shower you better have after lotion ready because your skin will feel thirsty, dry, and at times a little tight. The immediate \\&quot;tan\\&quot; you get is also deceiving because most of the color is from the lotion as it bakes on your skin and you will lose the glow pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also has a very bad, PUNGENT odor. It does not smell very good out of the bottle, but as soon as it heats up on your skin it just reeks. It is hard to explain, but it is a very distinctive smell that others around you will easily smell. This smell will also transfer to whatever clothing you have on and to the seat of your car if you are in shorts so keep this in mind. IT WILL STAIN CLOTHING as well. This is a grayish color in the bottle but it will dry DARK brown. It will stain white shirts, towels, and underwear if it dries on. You cannot go wrong with the price being so cheap, but it is nothing special at all.</li>
    <li> i bought this as a back up plan but i have not used it yet. the smell is not overpowering either.</li>
    <li> I love a silicone based tanning lotion.  Feels good to the skin.  Has a  good smell  even  after tanning.  Darker than  I have ever been.</li>
    <li> works great you get super dark not too orange but it does wash off</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have bought other Millennium tanning lotion, but this is my favorite...it seems to have the most bronzing color.  The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, I kind of like it.  I can actually go tanning, use this lotion and still go back to work (oh and my the way I am a Guy...ya, I know...I like my dark tan!)&lt;br /&gt;The color I get from this is not Orange either...just a nice dark color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip the expensive stuff at the tanning salon...what a rip off...buy this and get your bronze tan on.</li>
    <li> Love This Product !!!!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about this lotion, but it works great.  It really gets you dark.  I have had other lotions that leave a better smell, but this one gets you darker.</li>
    <li> wonderful lotion!  great scent and an even better color. I used it once and had a beautiful tan</li>
    <li> The smell of this lotion is fine before and after tanning. It goes on smooth but definitely leaves you streaky, it is more brown than orange though.</li>
    <li> I am very pale and it takes alot for me to hold a tsn, but within a few sessions I could already see a difference. I will continue  to order this lotion. Another plus it smells great</li>
    <li> I am a hard core tanner, For a non tingle lotion, this really gets you darker, with Auto-Darkening Tan Technology. great lotion to rotate in-between tingle sessions. smells good and leaves skin supper smooth.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with the quick delivery! The tanning lotion itself works very well, and I got tan with only a few sesions.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product with an excellent price, I recommend this product to anyone who wants to get a tan quickly.</li>
    <li> At first I seen a difference. But then I noticed I wasent getting much darkr and it was streaking my legs :|</li>
    <li> Fash shipper, bronzes well, smell good and a great price! This is my second bottle. I refuse to buy tanning lotion at the salon anymore-way over priced.</li>
    <li> i used to work in a tanning salon so i know a good lotion when i see it.&lt;br /&gt;obviously at first you stick ur nose up at a great price yet wtf price like this, so i was&lt;br /&gt;not the most excited to try it, but once i used it for a good week, i tan daily,&lt;br /&gt;and saw immediate results, which has never happened in any product i have used, i am so&lt;br /&gt;happy!! my skin is more smooth, i can tell the tanning lotion really went through more&lt;br /&gt;than just one layer of skin, it&#x27;s rich and perfect. couldn&#x27;t ask for more (: but i do alternate&lt;br /&gt;lotions every 3 days between the two i have, and the combo didn&#x27;t quite work for lasting results&lt;br /&gt;but just this lotion all the time, worked amazing. even if i just used it as a regular lotion/spf for out&lt;br /&gt;and about on the day to get the bronzers and melanin going in me with walking the dog and just outside.&lt;br /&gt;very pleased! will and have recommended to many!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. fragrance is nice and does not leave a tanning stench, very dark very fast!! I have been switching off between this and the more expensive color bomb and my color is amazing. The days I tan early I use the Solid Black or the Black Storm as the dreaded \\&quot;Tanning Stench\\&quot; is not a problem with these. The color bomb has some better skin moisturizer so I use that too. At this price this is a great lotion and the tone has no orange or yellow undertones. Very pretty dark golden tan. Highly recommend this lotion and Black Storm.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I saw what wonderful reviews it has. Worth a shot right? Turned out to be the right choice. Saw a deep tan the 2nd time I used it. There is not nearly as much of a tanning bed smell after you tan with this. Bc of the silicone your skin is really smooth. Only advice with this is to wipe in-between your fingers after you apply this. Otherwise you will have weird looking stains between them. Planning on buying again.</li>
    <li> Literally the best tanning lotion out there. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tan often, but I think this bronzer is incredible. I&#x27;ve used a couple others in the past and it&#x27;d take me a week or two to get pretty tan. I got a good tan with this in three days! And it really gives your skin a nice brown look, not orange. I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a month ago and it shipped quickly and i was so excited to try it out. It was a horrible lotion it left me with orange streaks and did nothing to make me darker. I would NOT recommend this product it was very disappointing considering all of the great reviews. It reminded me of a bad self tanner</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells great and get awesome color with it!</li>
    <li> Had to return because of the smell. It smells like perfume not tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Saw results immediately!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty cheap for tanning lotion. Just make sure you wipe it off from between your fingers. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll notice the webbing of your fingers will be really tan because of the bronzer. I&#x27;m basically Casper the ghost, so I can&#x27;t say how much more tan this made me. I noticed I was slightly more tan but I&#x27;m guessing people with a more normal skin tone will have more luck than I did. I&#x27;m not sure a $1000 bottle of tanning lotion would help me.</li>
    <li> Had an absurd skin reaction to this.</li>
    <li> Only have to tan like once a week for 10 minutes to look healthy!!!</li>
    <li> The product was horrible not happy</li>
    <li> give a nie dark glow , love solid black I would buy this product again</li>
    <li> A little too orange on the hands...</li>
    <li> This product is great, I didn&#x27;t have to pay alot for this product and it works great.</li>
    <li> My original review of this tanning lotion was only going to be 1 star.. Reason it gave me an orangey color and not a nice brown tan. The reason??? I didn’t have a good base tan. After the original orangey experience I did not want to use this product ever again.. THANK GOD I DID!!!!!!... Once I built up my base tan on a whim I decided what the hell I’d try it again.. It gave me a perfect deep brown tan this time around.. So my advice to anyone is if your turning orange instead of brown you really need to evaluate your base tan if you have just started tanning and are working on your base tan, I would highly recommend staying away from this product for now, you’d be better off going with a lower bronzer like Paint it Black x50 (Which I have also used and is very good)&lt;br /&gt;As far as your hands turning orange, I found it was a little orange between the webbing of the fingers but its fairly easy to scrub off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in All a great product..BUT ONLY IF YOU HAVE A BASE TAN!!!!!!!...</li>
    <li> THIS LOTION IS TOP OF THE LINE!!!  I USE IT &amp; THE BLACK &amp; TAN &amp; PAINT IT BLACK ALL BY MILLENIUM TANNING.  I ROTATE ALL 3 &amp; HAVE GOTTEN FANTASTIC RESULTS!!!  WORTH THE $$$!!!</li>
    <li> This has been a favorite of mine for a while now. Love it!</li>
    <li> Turned my skin orange and striped, reminded me of the old Copper Tone tan when I was a teenager that turned an awlful orange.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have ever used.  Hands down.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells great and not stronng like perfume. It does have self tanner in it so be careful to wipe off excess</li>
    <li> when I am going to tanning booth I use this and love it!! it really brings  out the color and feels and smells good!</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS THE BEST IM LIGHT SKIN  REDHEAD AND ITS HARD FOR ME TO GET A NICE PRETTY TAN BUT THIS HELPED SOOOO MUCH THANKS :)</li>
    <li> Not great. It does smell good but otherwise it&#x27;s not any better than a cheaper brand. If you get it make sure to wash your hands after tanning it will turn your fingers orange.</li>
    <li> Love it will buy again</li>
    <li> Fake product. Didn&#x27;t tan.</li>
    <li> this stuff works really good. I already had a good tan but this made it much darker. Good stuff I will buy again when I run out</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It works great and is less expensive than all the lotions at my tanning salon. Great service.</li>
    <li> The product came on time, and was packaged so that it would not activated before opening which was awesome.  It seems to work fairly well, and is definitely worth the price you pay.  I would like the bronzer to last just a little longer, but other than that it seems to be a good product!</li>
    <li> We have a home tanning bed and i purchased this for my wife.  She loves the way this stuff helps her tan.</li>
    <li> Bronzer extremely orange and will stain hands.</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion!  Highly reccomend!!!</li>
    <li> Best indoor tanning lotion. The smell is great!! I can go tanning on my lunch break from work and do not have to worry about feeling greasy or having a funky smell. After my first session, I noticed I was darker immediately. I highly reccomend this!!</li>
    <li> This works really well for darkening your tan. Would purchase again for sure. This is a great product that does what it claims.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel and texture of this lotion once you rub it into your skin.  The bronzers leave a nice brown color, not orangey at all!  It smells really nice unlike the Paint it black lotion but the smell goes away once you get out of the bed.  It gave me a really nice color after only one use!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite. I recommend using it after getting a base tan. Fast shipping and great packaging.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I could tell a difference after the first use.  I will definitely buy again.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> IM AN ADVANCED TANNER, BEEN TANNING FOR 9 YRS. I AM DARK AND CANT SEEM TO GET DARKER, UNTIL I USED THIS. I DEF DID GET MORE TAN. NOT ORANGE, BROWN!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and have tried many lotions, both cheap and expensive.  I normally use Designer Skin and took a liking to their $120 lotion called Luminary.  BUT Solid Black is just as great, if not better.  In one session of using this, I received the results of tanning for a week everyday.  I am so happy that I don&#x27;t have to take the time to tan as often and I get to save my skin from tanning frequently.  I very highly recommend trying this and for the price, you can&#x27;t be dissatisfied!</li>
    <li> Not noticing much of a difference after many tanning sessions. I&#x27;m pale, but usually build a tan pretty easily when using a bed regularly and I noticed no difference between my standard tan and what this lotion had added.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning on and off for over 10 years. I always have a difficult time seeing any kind of results within the first few weeks. I&#x27;m very fair skined. I usually wear an ivory colored make up if that gives you any indication how light I am. I usually buy the $100 tanning lotions from my salon when I do start tanning again. I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much so I gave this lotion a try. I have used it 4 times and I already see amazing results. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t streak and it doesn&#x27;t leave me orange colored. It&#x27;s a nice golden brown tan. The smell is a little overpowering the first time I used it but I haven&#x27;t noticed it since. I usually cannot handle the smell of most scented lotions. Definitely worth the price! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I have always purchased very expensive lotions ($50+), and since I&#x27;m on a budget I decided to try something a little less expensive. This lotion has amazed me for being so cheap. It is not tingling lotion, it is a bronzing lotion. The only thing I recommend is wiping your hands off after you rub the lotion in because it may leave orange between your fingers. I bought this lotion a little over a week ago, and I&#x27;ve been tanning every other day and I am very tan and VERY happy! This is my new favorite bottle of lotion.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I have used to date!</li>
    <li> This lotion is very good. Goes on smooth and has a great bronzer in it! I would recommend this to other! Just make sure you whipe yours hands off after you&#x27;ve applied the lotion!</li>
    <li> Have used this product regularly with tanning bed for more than six months.  It maintains a deep, natural looking tan and moisturizes skin</li>
    <li> This its awesome.  It will get you very dark, not orange, dark.  Make sure you wash your hands after application though, because it will stain them if your not careful.  That its my only complaint.</li>
    <li> It works and you get darker, but it has self tanning lotion in it, I don&#x27;t want to tan in a bed and put a self tanner on. the insides of my fingers turned darker brown. there is just too many other products out there without self tanning cream, no likey 100x bronzer</li>
    <li> If a nice deep dark tan is what you seek, then this is the product for you! I have used this product in the past and have always had amazing results. The only problem is that once you quit using it and just go back to normal tanning, you WILL NOT be as dark, so you will need to keep using to keep achieving the same results. For the price, the tan is so worth it. Especially if you have a wedding or a special event coming up. If you already had a bit of color it will only take you about 3 tans using this product to have a nice deep bronze. And this is coming from a naturally pale Irish girl! So if I can tan, anyone can! :)</li>
    <li> Have to make sure you put on very even!!! I like it other then the sreaks sometimes. Getting tan! &amp;I never get tan.</li>
    <li> I reall like this tanning lotion! It has an amazing smell and I love the deep bronzing action. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars but the bronzer stains your hands. Sooooo, wear gloves! Other than that it shipped super fast and works great!</li>
    <li> I think the lotion does its job, but leaves you smelling burnt. It doesn&#x27;t bother me too bad bc I usually just go to bed after, but don&#x27;t plan on going anywhere right after you tan!</li>
    <li> I am extremely fair and this product worked wonders for me. I would recommend it to everyone! I will be buying another bottle when mine runs out!</li>
    <li> First time use and was so very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is super!!!! When I use it, the girls at the tanning salon tell me how dark I am! It&#x27;s great and smells decent too.</li>
    <li> Okay, I bought this hoping it would make me darker, Well it sorta is, but its streaks on my body, turns your hands orange, makes you dark in some places and not others, feet look like I have skin cancer and it smells like playdoh when first apply and then after tanning you stink! and btw I had a base tan already. I was really looking for something to make me look and smell good but this doesnt do the trick!!</li>
    <li> Ive been tanning for a long time and this is def a great bronzing lotion! Does not make you orange like alot do even tho the bronzer is very stong! Not for fair or light skin.If your lookin to bring it to the next level this lotion is for you!!</li>
    <li> Really haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it the way i like cause im a new mother but love the smell ... it doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty after smell ...</li>
    <li> For the cost I was hesitant that it might not be very good. But reading the reviews I said sure, not expensive to try it. 1st time I was really darker. So product does work well. I don&#x27;t like the bronzers in general make me smell after I tan is my only down fall. But wash your hands after. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion works great to get you really dark fast! Some complaints I have is that it will stain your skin wherever you don&#x27;t rub in good. Also, the palms of your hands and in between your fingers will be a brownish/orangey color if you don&#x27;t remove the lotion immediately. My biggest issue is that the color fades in my inner elbows and it looks awful. The active bronzer in the lotion will stain the surface of the skin. And for some reason, the surface of skin around my inner elbows peels away and I&#x27;m left with white/uneven toned/horrible looking inner elbows. The unevenness also moves up my arms and it looks terrible...and I absolutely, positively hate that aspect of it. But as far as a lotion that will get you really dark really fast, this is great!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. The feel and the smell are great. The product was sent right away and I get good color.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. It makes my skin super soft after application. I have used it 3 times and have a great tan already.</li>
    <li> product was as described</li>
    <li> This lotion works really well! The bronzer is amazing, has a silky feel to it and smells good (for tanning lotion). Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price on amazon!! Salon&#x27;s sell for $50 and up for the same thing. I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and this is 1 of the top lotions I&#x27;d recommend :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading all of the great reviews and I definitely agree with them.  You can&#x27;t get a better product for a better price.  I love the colour I&#x27;m getting from this product and the smell is good too.  I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars because the smell of this lotion is more of a masculine, clean smell and I prefer the more fruitier lotion scents.  However, it&#x27;s still a great product that I would buy again for its quality and price.</li>
    <li> Product did not work for me. I started to become orange after one use. It doesn&#x27;t smell good nor does it absorb into the skin well.</li>
    <li> This is the first tanning lotion I have ever hated. It left me streaky and orange like a cheap selftanner. I&#x27;ve never had this happen with a tanning bed lotion, until now. I will not be purchasing again and I threw this one out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tanning lotion for a month now and have seen dramatic results. No irritation and it has made my skin softer! Love this lotion!</li>
    <li> My tan looks awesome after one use. There are a lot of bronzers in this so putting it on evenly and rubbing it in good is very important. I think I&#x27;m gonna alternate between this lotion and another non bronzing lotion just to make sure I&#x27;m still building a tan and not just piling on dye. The smell is good and the after tan odor is really minimal, and was easily covered by my cheap after tan lotion. But seriously wow my tan looks great! Nice and golden brown, exactly what I was wanting.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion EVER! People alwaya aak me if I&#x27;ve been tanning. Smells good and you will not see any streaks but it&#x27;s not instant. It&#x27;s just a beautiful gradual tan.</li>
    <li> It made me itch like crazy</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it&#x27;s the first lotion I ever used. It smells great, has a good consistency and easily absorbs into skin. Doesn&#x27;t stick on the surface and will be completely absorbed by the time you&#x27;re done tanning so don&#x27;t worry about it getting on your clothes. You will get a nice golden tan after 1 use (I go 10 minutes in a stand up). Well worth the money.. so much better than other more expensive lotions.</li>
    <li> Let me just start off by saying that I only tan once a week with a max of fifteen minutes. I have tried various lotions from Sally Beauty Supply and different sellers on Amazon, but none of them compared to this lotion. I wasn&#x27;t seeing the results I wanted with the other lotions, so I decided to give this lotion a try, due to the plethora of positive reviews. I am really glad that I listened to the majority of reviewers, and I will go into detail about why.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the lotion has a great scent to it, which sets itself apart from other lotions because it doesn&#x27;t smell quite like a tanning lotion. Secondly, this is a super bronzing lotion -- when you put this on your skin for the first time and let it soak in, you can already see a faint touch of color. When I first started using this lotion I already had a decent tan, but upon using this twice I have noticed a significant difference in my skin color. My tan is much deeper than I had expected it to be, especially with only going once a week. I&#x27;m sure that if you use this lotion consecutively for a period of a few days to a week, you will see the results you have only been dreaming of (weird, yes). I have been recommending this lotion to friends and family that tan, and they have seen great results as well. I never imagined I would be this dark, but it is all thanks to this handy-dandy lotion that I went on a limb to purchase. My bottle isn&#x27;t even half-way through yet, and I find myself wanting to purchase another bottle just to have in my stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t rub the lotion in completely, you will have a little build-up on your skin that will eventually fade after a shower or two (due to the amount of bronzer in the lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are reading this and you are unsure about the lotion, give it a try! If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with it, give it to a friend who may use it.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. it smells really good and i am super tan. not orange and it came really fast in the mail!</li>
    <li> best ever!! you need to get this ASAP</li>
    <li> I previously worked in a tanning salon so I know quite a bit about lotions, and this is a great product if you are trying to get dark fast....however I was not happy when I received the package and the return address was CondomMan.com it definately makes the people you live with wonder what you are ordering online</li>
    <li> I have only had the opportunity to use this once but I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made, I&#x27;m still a little (slightly) burned today, the product is thick and creamy and will last a long time and, I don&#x27;t want to exaggerate but, this product at the salon is like crazy expensive, I&#x27;m just sorry I never thought of getting it here a long time ago!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing lotion.</li>
    <li> I did an experiment and only used this lotion on the left side of my body/ After 2 weeks of using a high powered booth, there is not a bit of color difference on either side.  Most of these lotions do not work, it&#x27;s all hype.  If you doubt it, try this yourself.  As long as your skin is moisturized it will help you tan.  Doesn&#x27;t matter what you use.  I&#x27;d have been quite upset had I spent $100 on this like it claims.  It does not smell good either. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad but nothing special about it, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer and the price was hard to beat! It is sold at my tanning salon for over $50! Is creamy and hydrating - doesn&#x27;t completely keep you from having the tanning bed smell but has been the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to purchasing lotion at the salon. Smells good, wife loves it, and I love the savings.</li>
    <li> Seems to just wash off, just was not what I expected. Have used other Millenium products and they have been good.</li>
    <li> Great price and arrived quickly!  I will purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! I was a shade darker the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Good tanning lotion, the smell is strong for me but goes away pretty quick.</li>
    <li> As a guy, I hate buying lotion.  However, it&#x27;s one of those necessary things for tanning beds.  This lotion doesn&#x27;t have a girly smell or girly branding.  I don&#x27;t feel so embarrassed walking around with it in my hand or on my skin.</li>
    <li> I received this in two days of ordering and have only been to the tanning salon two times. WOW!!!!! I am already seeing a tan!!!!! Would highly recommend this product. The only thing is the palms of your hands will turn bronze so I would suggest taking wet wipes to wipe your hands immediately after applying lotion.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing it at the salon for $90. It works great and it smells nice too, I will be buying this again.It arrived in just a few days</li>
    <li> I really like this tanning lotion.  I like the bronzer in it as it doesn&#x27;t make you look orange.  Both my wife and I used it and were happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Been a fan of this product for years.  So many others have tingle and those that don&#x27;t do not work nearly as well.  Dedicated to this product.</li>
    <li> Good thing about ordering this product is that it came suuuuuuper fast!&lt;br /&gt;I went from using Paint It Black, which is an amazing lotion, never had any problems with!!&lt;br /&gt;I used Solid Black about 3 times, and started to get streaky.&lt;br /&gt;I spread my lotion on every inch of my body, evenly and I&#x27;ve never gotten streaky before with ANY lotions I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using this lotion and go tanning with nothing on just to get my tan to be even again.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be using this lotion much anymore :/ I think all the bronzers in it would&#x27;ve made me look orange anyways...</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is amazing. I use it inside the tanning bed and it makes me dark really fast! It also has a good smell to it. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely not what everyone was ranting over. I have light/medium color skin and thought this would take me to the next level of my tanning but it&#x27;s the exact same! Would not buy again. Doesn&#x27;t smell good at all!!</li>
    <li> Listen this tanning lotion does a great job and the price is reasonable. I will buy this again the only thing that I dont like is the smell but this is something I can live with cause I got very dark fast after only one or two tanning sessions believe me see for yourself now I realize why it has mostly 5 star ratings......</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews I read and I was not disappointed.  After using this product one time I could see a visible difference in my tan, much darker than with any other product.  It also has a great smell and makes my skin feel great.  I definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I do not think this product is enhancing my tan nor does it contain a significant amount of bronzer. The only positive is it is a nice moisturizer.</li>
    <li> worked pretty well. I&#x27;ve been tanning for several months now and I am a caramel tan color. the bronzers are just a little too strong for me, because I began breaking ou . but does get you tan!</li>
    <li> You get a nice dark, deep tan. Great deal for sure!</li>
    <li> Created a deep, dark tan in less time than normal...will reorder as summer approaches!</li>
    <li> Love the product...would recommend it to anyone who tan&#x27;s indoors. It also smells great. Received the product quickly after purchase.</li>
    <li> Every time I go to a tanning salon and they try to sell me a bottle of &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; lotion, I just pull out this bottle and they leave me alone.  Or say &amp;#34;oh yes,  use that one&amp;#34; It works great!  Used it for 2 weeks before my wedding in Maui and I was a beautiful golden color and everyone commented on my healthy glow</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for years and have used every tanning lotion under the sun. Solid Black is head and shoulders above the rest. I used to tan every day, alternating high pressure beds with regular beds. I was really tan, but wanted to get darker – I had hit the “tanning plateau” until I tried solid black. I got much darker, and now I don’t even tan every day. Tanning can take a toll on your face, so if you do tan your face, use a good moisturizer. I use Skingenixx Super Hydrating Moisturizer [[ASIN:B00VSCKY1E Skingenixx Hyaluronic Acid Facial Moisturizer.]], it is packed with powerful ingredients that make your skin softer, smoother and reduce any damage from tanning. Try these amazing products!!</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> Im normally fair skinned. Used this one time tanning and already got a good color. The smell is neutral and wears off  after time which is a plus. Just be sure to wipe your hands off and in between fingers after using because it does have bronzer in it which made my fingers a little orange.</li>
    <li> I have used Paint it Black and Black Storm, but this is by far my favorite! I&#x27;ve only used it twice and I am noticeably darker! The smell is ok, but I looked at myself after tanning last night and was almost as dark as when I was at my \\&quot;full tan\\&quot; with Black Storm. I&#x27;m anxious to see how I look in a couple weeks. It will be nice to not have to tan as often and still look dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to make sure you wash your hands after application, because it will stain your hands, but other than that it is awesome! I would recommend it to anyone. I am fair skinned and it usually takes me a while to get a nice tan.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  The price is great, the smell is sweet and the color you get is amazing.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I may change this review depending on how the next week of using it at the tanning bed goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It seems to have completely evened out my color, however, barely noticeable color change after 20 minutes on full blast browning tanning bed. And i have a base tan so that&#x27;s unusual.&lt;br /&gt;- silky and smooth, skin feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The barely noticeable bit, but it&#x27;s been 1 time. I may lower or raise the review, depending.&lt;br /&gt;- It gave me a lot of tiny acne bumps that went away after scrubbing but it&#x27;s definitely from the lotion. I&#x27;ve never gotten acne before in my life, hence how I know it was due to that. It happened within an hr of using it.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion works great! But be careful because if you lay to long using this lotion you will burn! Great lotion! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this bronzer.  If you&#x27;re looking for a product to give you a nice brown tan with a pleasant smell, get yourself a few bottles of this.</li>
    <li> This lotion WILL increase your tan, I used it about 4 times a week. It would really stain my skin orange. I consistently had orange between my fingers even though I washed them after. No amount of scrubbing would get rid of it! Also, it left very noticable orange streaks on my arms and legs...I am trying a different lotion.</li>
    <li> Not too many complaints, definitely made me darker! i was very cautious with this lotion because i already had use an amazing lotion (austrailan gold cheeky bronze) and didnt know how it would compair. Great price, good product! Only complaint i have is that it was streaky if not rubbed in properly, the main issue being that it was not wiped off my hands fully.</li>
    <li> Works really good. Got the Tan I wanted .</li>
    <li> I really like this bronzer, but I do have one complaint.  This lotion goes on dark and can streak if you don&#x27;t apply it evenly.  There were many times where I found patches of &amp;#34;darker&amp;#34; skin tone on my arms and legs where I had missed a spot or just hadn&#x27;t rubbed it in well enough.  I looked like I was covered in birthmarks.  Those patches of discoloration were noticable for almost a month!  Overall, I liked the look of the lotion after tanning, but I learned my lesson to make sure I applied this as evenly as possible.</li>
    <li> Fingers turned orange in between</li>
    <li> I havn&#x27;t tried too many tanning lotions but this one seems to work pretty darn well! It smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave you lookin orange or stain your hands. Overall I give it an A++ :)</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. I started using it bc my arms don&#x27;t match the rest of my body so I had to search around for sum thing that would work so I started looking at all the reviews and had to try this one bc everyone was having the same problem I was having before using solid black. Now I am even all over with a golden dark brown tan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a while now and I have a nice golden tan. It also has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t make a difference in the bed. I think it&#x27;s watered down.</li>
    <li> i really liked it until i noticed it gave me a rash and left me with orange blotches. maybe i just didnt put it on even enough though</li>
    <li> Very good product and great price for the product.  Also the smell of the lotion is very minimal so if you don&#x27;t like the strong smelling ones this will work.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and I&#x27;ve tried many different types of lotion and this one is at the top of my list.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is a fake. It did not work!!! I don&#x27;t know whats inside this bottle but it was garbage.</li>
    <li> put on when going outside to do yard work or just to relax and tans ya great</li>
    <li> Best deep tan, smells good too!</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion a couple of times and haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my tan. I have used two bottles of Paint It Black and Black Storm. Out of the three I think I would recommend Paint it Black. I just hate the smell. Solid Black smells okay, after tanning smell is not as bad as Paint It black. I would prefer not to have to shower after tanning so I tried a packet of lotion called Fiesta Sun Trix Vendome Level 2. Here is the product link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U515OO/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title&lt;br /&gt;It smells good before and after tanning and gives me a beautiful brown glow. Check it out!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS TANNING LOTION ,THIS MAKE YOUR SKIN SO DARK ,AND SOFT,I LIKE IT VERY MUCH,TAKE IT AND YOU WILL LOVE THIS NEW BRONZER</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! use it every summer!</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by this tanning lotion, and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I was very pleased with the results after my first use. I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
    <li> exactly what the salon sells just less price. gift for teen daughter and she was tickled. good product smells great works well</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE!!!! This is a horrible tanning lotion! Even though it is a cheap buy, it&#x27;s a total waste of money. Straight into the garbage it goes. This tanning lotion is EXTREMELY streaky. I even tried blending it really well. It does not help you get tan at all. I go in the most expensive tanning bed at the tanning salon (a high pressure tanning bed) and this does absolutely nothing to help you get any color while tanning. If you&#x27;re looking for a great tanning lotion that also has a bronzer in it and is low in cost try Australian Gold Cheeky Brown ;).</li>
    <li> This stuff works very good. Since I have been using it I have become noticeably darker, I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I guess this is a great product, my friends have tried with success but not in my case, I do not know why but when I used I finish with a bad rash and my skin itch so bad. I guess is strong for my weak skin.</li>
    <li> Great indoor tanning lotion. Smells great. Works like it says. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> If you do not rub it in completly so there is not even the slightest bit of dampness on your akin. It leaves major streaks. Also if later that day u put regular lotion on. Like before you go to bed. It leavs big streaks when you wake up.</li>
    <li> It has a large amount of self-tanner in it, so you&#x27;ll get streakiness if not thoroughly applied and rubbed in, and if you can&#x27;t wash your hands quickly after your tanning session, you&#x27;ll get the orange crescents in between your fingers.  At most tanning salons I&#x27;ve been to, you only have 3 minutes to get undressed and put your lotion on, which leads to hurried application and zebra like streaks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very good. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> i got mine fairly quick . I have used it once and have noticed a few orange streaks. although, it is my first time using any tanning lotion it could have been me not rubbing it in evenly enough but other than that I love the color it gives me ....you get what you pay for&#x3D;]</li>
    <li> It definitely works. Boosts your tan in one use, but you just have to be sure to apply it evenly. Otherwise you will end up with streaks. And wear gloves perhaps or wipe your hands super well. I ended up with orange marks between my fingers that didn&#x27;t fade away for about two weeks. &#x3D;\ But as long as you&#x27;re careful about rubbing it in well, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells good and works as a nice bronzer. Non-greasy and dries quickly. Very happy with this product, thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had excellent results with this tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> Love this, the product smells wonderful.  Leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> works well will buy again</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this bronzing lotion.  I have used other lotions that are so much more expensive and just didn&#x27;t give me any where near the results.  Definitely make sure you wash your hands thoroughly or you will have brownish orange streaks between your fingers.  I noticed awesome results within two times of using this product.  I don&#x27;t look orange at all and it gave me a richer, darker tan.  I will be ordering this one again!</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion ever</li>
    <li> It sucks. It&#x27;s horrible I did nothing for me what&#x27;s so ever. Do not buy this. Did not make me tan at all. Wal mart has better ones then this</li>
    <li> Smells awful!&lt;br /&gt;Tans well</li>
    <li> Luv this product.  One session and what a difference.  Like the smell of it too.</li>
    <li> This lotion gives great color to your skin and the smell is what you want in a tanning lotion. It smells more like a sun tan lotion than an indoor lotion, which is pleasant.</li>
    <li> absolutely loved. I have been tanning on and off for years and am naturally very pale. This lotion worked great and got me color fast! And for that price? WOW. I would buy this over the other tanning lotions there any day, not even because of the price. RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this lotion!!!!  My husband and I fight over the bottle.  I just ordered another one and he can have the &amp;#34;almost gone &amp;#34; bottle.  Excellent color! Excellent fresh clean scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not new to tanning I have a pretty good base tan and tan easily , this product did not wow me but it did its job. I noticed that I did tan a little more than i typically have without lotion. I would buy again just to have something because you can&#x27;t beat the price but is not smething I would recommend to others really.</li>
    <li> It turned my orange and smells terrible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for a little over 2 weeks - gradually worked up to 20 minutes using \\&quot;Smile You&#x27;re Dark\\&quot;. With it, it made me darker than I was originally, but I just wanted to be a little darker for my engagement photos so after reading all the great reviews I ordered this product. When I used it for the first time I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable change.  The next day I used this lotion again. By the next day (after 2 days of using this product) I noticed that my arms, wrists, knees, ankles, and other parts of my body we orange and streaky - just days before my engagement photos will be taken!! Thank goodness there&#x27;s Photoshop and it wasn&#x27;t on the day of my wedding or I&#x27;d be devastated! Im surprised no one else has complained about turning orange! Maybe I just got a bad bottle.</li>
    <li> I use it in the tanning bed and to lay out in the sun.  Love the dark color I get.</li>
    <li> Was on time and the lotion is fantastic</li>
    <li> I could see results after the first use. It has a bit of  weird after smell, but most if not all tanning lotions do. It has lasted me 2 months now, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other product. Plus the price is just a big bonus. soooooooooooooo worth it!</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well!!!  I won&#x27;t waste my money on another tanning session w/o this.  I get so much more tan out of my tanning!</li>
    <li> Works great and a lot cheaper that buying right at the tanning facilities. Will be buying again in the future.</li>
    <li> Tan after one application.. Love this lotion!</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. I had bought some from a salon for MUCH more money, and it didnt tan me nearly as well this lotion! I definitely recommend this! :)</li>
    <li> I have a hard time tanning, but I felt like whatever color this gave me was just the self tanner in the lotion. A friend who recommended it to me has a much easier time tanning and really loved it. Go figure.</li>
    <li> Some tanning beds have different levels of UV light, this Solid Black is applicable to all levels. Works perfectly with 30 bulb tanning bed!</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money on this garbage, spend a few extra dollars and buy the real stuff. The only benefit to this stuff is it smells good, other than that it does nothing. It is definitely nowhere near the 100x bronzer it claims. The Paul D Bronze beats lotion is 50 times darker than this lotion so if this is 100x then the Pauly D lotion must be 5,000x bronzer. Overall not satisfied with the product, its a waste of money, buy a real brand and skip this one.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant considering this was the first product that returned in my search for tanning lotions, I wanted to do a little more research before purchasing. i finally settled on it just due to the amazon price vs what it retails for. it is worth every penny!! ive used it TWICE and im equally as dark as I would otherwise be after 7+ days of tanning using other lotions. I must say though (as with other lotions) do NOT shower immediately after tanning. I always shower right before tanning, exfoliate, and then dont shower again til the morning. With this lotion I was a little red after I got out (not as red as you would see with &#x27;tingle&#x27; lotions) but within the next 2-3 hours, i kept getting darker and darker. this lotion has a great smell and not an overly-dark tint, so i wasnt worried about it staining my hands/clothes. BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and I&#x27;m getting good color form it, but make sure to rub it in really really evenly and really well because you will get streaky. and wash your hands after you use it, i have really dark spots around my fingers where it&#x27;s stained.  My husband loves the smell, I&#x27;m not so fond of it.  I prefer the \\&quot;tropical ish\\&quot; smelling lotions, like the designer skin black lotion.  great for the price, but definitely not my favorite. i&#x27;m just trying to finish the bottle so i can get something else.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion before and I loved it! I was not disappointed this time either. The first time I used it I noticed it working. It smells good and no awful after smell either. It also leaves your skin feeling so soft. I will definitely continue to keep buying this lotion as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I am a fairly new indoor bed tanner and I practically knew nothing about lotions and bronzer&#x27;s, but thanks to my best friend she taught me everything I know! Before I bought this 100x lotion I was using a 75x that I wasn&#x27;t very happy with. I bought solid black 100x while I was on a level 2 bed, and I saw immediate results! The next week I upgraded to a level 3 bed, and let me tell you I got complements the first day while I was leaving the salon. I would recommend this lotion, but you have to be careful, the only thing is, this lotion IS so strong if you don&#x27;t put it on evenly it will show. You don&#x27;t want to put it on your feet, and while in the bed may want to keep your hands in fists to stop your palms from turning orange. (Even if you wash them after applying the lotion). As long as you apply evenly, I think you will love this lotion as much (if not more) than I do! Happy tanning!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent tanning lotion. Although, you do need to be careful to rub it in good and wash your hands afterward. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for a while &amp; never have had this problem with any other lotion. It left dark orange/brownish streaks all over my legs. Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if you took the extra time to really apply it well. But when I go tanning I want to just throw on my lotion and hop in the booth. I&#x27;ll be throwing this lotion away, total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works great and I started seeing results much sooner than other lotions!</li>
    <li> i am a tanaholic!! I love silicone bronzning lotion :) At first i was a little nervous about this lotion becuase all the reviews seemed to be saying the same thing. I trusted what most of the people said. AND THANK GOD I DID!!! I just got my lotion last week, i have tanned every day since then... I already had a nice base tan and I just wanted to get that really nice brown golden tan i used to have :) within three 10min sessions in a PLATINUM bed( which is the best tanning bed at my salon) I was so brown and golden that i couldn&#x27;t beleive it!!!! i have never found a lotion this amazing.. I&#x27;ve been tanning for a little over 2 years now and this is by far my favorite tanning lotion. It makes my skin feel so soft( thanks to the silicone) it smells amazing( even after you get out of the tanning bed) and it continues to bronze my skin after i get out of the tanning bed :) I would highly recomend this lotion to EVERYONE!!! BY the way i am a girl who like lotions that work great but dosen&#x27;t really have that (over powerin smeel to it) also i love the bottle.. hands down 5 STARS :)</li>
    <li> I am sorry I have to write like this but I need to clarify and give another view point because I too was swayed by all the positive reviews, but if you are used to using a tanning lotion that actually works, like swedish beauty , you will not be happy with this one. I am inclined to wonder if these positive reviews are fake because I cannot understand how anyone would think this works, there is no tingle and it doesn&#x27;t help you tan. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money just get some swedish beauty which is what I will be going back to, and this bottle just sits in my closet and is about to be garbage soon.</li>
    <li> BEST tanning product I EVER used... I was a little skeptical, because the price was so LOW... but when I went to the tanning salon, seen they seel the SAME product for almost 100$ a bottle. Never again. I tan, occasionally but every year at least to start my season. I am Irish, and pale.. I used this ONE time with a high pressure bed.. and came out TAN!I am so excited, I immediatly bought the 3 pack. I am going to have the BEST tan for Mexico..</li>
    <li> I Love it. It works really fast. Smells Good also!! Goes on easy!! Showers off easy also! Great Product!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t bad just doesn&#x27;t bronze as much as I would like. It comes in a decent size though so can&#x27;t complain. It smells pretty good too and goes on streakless.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this tanning lotion. has a bronzer so it makes you look more than than you actually are, .</li>
    <li> I like this lotion..goes on easily..n u get good results with it..would purchase it again without a second thought..has heightened my tanning to a new level</li>
    <li> Good price and great product</li>
    <li> Everyone complimented me on my tan, great color on my legs. The smell was not to bad either, better than most after tanning.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lotion I have tried! I saw huge color difference after my first use and the post tanning smell was great also,have already purchased my next bottle!!</li>
    <li> You will see results after the first use. Smells great. No offensive after tanning smell. Moisturizes as well and leaves your skin incredibly smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. The first two times I used it I still really burned which doesn&#x27;t usually happen when I&#x27;ve used other types of lotions. The 3rd time I used it I didn&#x27;t really burn but I don&#x27;t think it has as much bronzer in it as it says it does.</li>
    <li> I am not an easy perosn to tan but this product really helps give me color. This is the 2nd time I have ordered SOlid Black.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! Sooo much bronzer in it that it leaves you looking orange. It&#x27;s an unnatural looking tan and leaves you streaky. Save yourself the trouble not worth it.</li>
    <li> Amazing Tanning Loation. I love it!</li>
    <li> This lotion left my skin with orange patches and streaks, and also faded horribly. I was hoping it would be comparable to a tanning salon lotion, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Worked really well. And quick. I noticed results within a few days. Smells good. I&#x27;ll definitely reorder. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The smell is alot better then most tanning lotions. and u dont have that after tanning smell. but i didnt see a huge dramatic differnce as i have with tingle lotions. it was just like any other tanning lotion. im glad i didnt pay a ton of money for it</li>
    <li> Its a GREAT product!!! Does get u really dark!!! I love it very much!!! Would def buy again!!! All I can say is.....buy it n try it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a really good product!  I am a natural tone how ever I get a base tan fairly quickly as I tan more then burn.  during the winter drag, I had went weeks without tanning. around spring I started to pick back up and after 1 10 minute session I notice a base color come back (I am a pretty fair person) after a couple more times with in a 2 week span the tan was gradually coming back.  its summer now and I have been trying to get a natural bronz color and with this product and going every other day (about 5 times) with in the past wk 1/2 I am very pleased with the results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Solid Black for several years now, I get immediate results and a long lasting tan! Love this product!</li>
    <li> It is a nice lotion but make sure you wipe it off between your fingers before tanning.</li>
    <li> Have to rub in even so it don&#x27;t leave streeks</li>
    <li> This lotion came recommended by a co-worker/friend. It is just as she described &amp; I like it a lot. Seems to make a significant differenence using it opposed to other tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for a long time.  This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used and I have used well over 20 different kinds of tanning lotion.  I only have to tan once a week when I use this lotion because it makes me so dark from ONE tan. It doesn&#x27;t make me burn or blotchy. I absolutely LOVE this lotion and will continue to use it!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought this brand before however, I&#x27;d bought the X50.. I realized you really need to put this on evenly. I had a couple of places with streaks. I really like it though. It works great. Just be careful with it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Lived up to its expectations. Prompt delivery with prime two day delivery</li>
    <li> Great bronzer. keep your skin soft and also keeps it from drying out..</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I tan easily, but this gets me darker in half the time than anything I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> I Love it! !!! Got it in mail sooner than expected. Used it twice so far and can see a difference. Only bad thing is wash hands or wipe off right away does leave in between fingers.... No streaks that I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
    <li> They sell this product at the tanning salons for like $70. This product worked great! I did two months in the tanning bed (going once a week) at a level 4 or higher bed and used this product every time. I was VERY tan at the end of the two months!</li>
    <li> I could tell a difference when I first started using it.  Recommend whole heartily on this tanning lotion.  Very good.</li>
    <li> If looking like an Oompa Loompa is your goal then I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> OK so I used this for the first time today and I do not like it. It smells like men&#x27;s cologne and the worst part is my back is all broke out now. I think I will stick to the \\&quot;paint it black\\&quot; lotion becuz that smells good and I have no problems with it. But yea rgis solid black is not good in my opinion.....</li>
    <li> This lotion really helped me achieve the color i was going for..</li>
    <li> This lotion does a great job, but with all bronzers you have to be careful or it will streak.  The Solid Black smells good and does work.</li>
    <li> Great deal and I enjoyed them all</li>
    <li> Ordered this product thinking 100X bronzer must be good right?  I have used it twice and it definitely makes you darker.  I am not orange at all which is what I was trying to avoid.  I wash my hands very good after application so I haven&#x27;t had any issues with orange palms.  I&#x27;m very careful around elbows, knees, and feet to apply sparingly.  Has a great scent.  Dries quickly while leaving skin very moisturized. Would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this stuff. I bought it because of all the good reviews, but after using it twice, I wish I hadn&#x27;t. I guess everything works differently for people, but for me, this did not work nearly as well as the cheaper lotion I usually use, in terms of darkening my color. The worst part though, is the smell. Its not that bad when you first use it. But the after-tan-odor is bad, and it lasts foreverrr. I go home and take a shower and wash my hands a few times, and still smell for days. Its bad.&lt;br /&gt;:/</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion because I ran out of the Black Storm 60X Extreme Silicone Bronzer I was using and wanted to try something similar in style and price point.  This lotion is a great value, if you&#x27;re looking for an effective indoor tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot but still gets the job done.  It has a nice scent and I have been really nice color since I started using it.  I recommend it highly and will probably re-up when I run out.</li>
    <li> Omg i can not rave about this tanning lotion enough. I have bought many of the over priced stuff for years. Couldnt afford to again. I kept searching and reading reviews. I bought mine from a lady on ebay who has a salon. $3.00 cheaper than amazon. Ive used it a week. I tan pretty well anyway but this tan is gorgeous. Doesnt dry out my skin or make it oily. Smells pleasant. My husband even liked the smell after i finished tanning. I usually wait awhile before showering so it lasts a bit. Only recommendations are is make sure its rubbed in good which it does apply easily. Also wash hands when finished so they are not darker than you. Why waste money on 80.00 bottles  or so? This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just getting back into tanning and I wanted to try something with a bronzer in it.  My first experience was a little extreme. I got very red, but the next day I was a lush brown. It goes on very easy and after just a few sessions, I&#x27;m darker than my wife who&#x27;s been going for months!! I&#x27;ve already ordered a second bottle and I&#x27;m only 1/3 through my first!!</li>
    <li> If I could give this lotion no stars I would in a heart beat. This product had pretty good reviews and was much cheaper than the lotions I usually buy so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, HORRIBLE IDEA. I&#x27;ve tanned four times with this lotion and I&#x27;m a blotchy orange mess. It&#x27;s the most disgusting thing. Do NOT buy the lotion, unless you want to look like you just walked out of willy wonkas factory.</li>
    <li> I love this. It is my 2nd bottle in 2 years. I will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Australian Gold 45X bronzer and I just seemed to not be getting darker. Once I started using this though, not only did I notice a difference but my friends finally started making comments about how tan I was. I wouldn&#x27;t say it was extreme by any means but it definitely helped. And the smell is pretty mild. some people on here say a strong cologne or perfume smell, I don&#x27;t think so. More of a beachy smell mixed with a slight hint of perfume. And I&#x27;m partial to that beachy tanning lotion. I&#x27;m fine with people thinking I just went tanning. I don&#x27;t want to smell like a fruit.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product. This is the second year we have used it.</li>
    <li> Stained my feet and fingers</li>
    <li> I tan fairly easily, so for me I feel this product works extremely well. It has helped my tan darken faster than without anything, and it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than the ones they sell at the tanning salon. I apply before tanning and then after I tan, so I haven&#x27;t had any issue with my skin drying out.</li>
    <li> It smells good. I&#x27;ve used it once.  I&#x27;m not noticing any dramatic color enhancement. It is somewhat greasy. Doesn&#x27;t leave hands orange,  no tingle. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great price and works perfect. I hate how the tanning beds will rip you off with their expensive tanning lotions. This lotion is not expensive and gets you super dark, fast! I have very sensitive skin and it worked great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this tanning lotion!! I am so dark (not orange).  I get compliments on my tan all the time.  I am placing another order for all of my friends who have asked me to order them some.  This lotion smells SO good, before and after you tan.  I recommend this product 100%</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Its my second bottle and for how white I am this stuff makes a HUGE difference! I will definitely keep buying it! Fast shipping and at a great price you cant go wrong!</li>
    <li> I have my own tanning bed and Im always buying lotions to have on my shelf. I bought this one for my husband and he loved it, could notice a shade or two darker after 1 tan session. :) Great product. fast shipping. thanks</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; its a bronzer which shows great Color after tanning. I&#x27;ve recommended to a coworker &amp; she enjoyed it too</li>
    <li> Just remember to shake your bottle every time, and take the time to rub the lotion in really well, don&#x27;t rush...or you may have orange streaks since this one shows immediate color after tanning.  I love it, it&#x27;s lasting a long time too, amazing for the money!</li>
    <li> I purchased this tanning lotion after having good results with it in the past. When I first opened the lotion I noticed that the color was a little off. Also, the lotion was very thin, unlike what I had purchased from my salon in the past. I have used the same bronzing tanning bed for the past 5 years and have never had a burn. After using this lotion one time, I had a horrible burn. Two weeks later, and my skin is still peeling head to toe. Horrible lotion. Bad experience! I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I tried so many tanning cream from 20$ to 140$  and I decide to buy that one as a cheap tanning cream and the review was very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you that I use that one more often than my expensive cream.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very hard to tan and with that cream I&#x27;m darker (not orange)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a specific smell like fruit or candy smell but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
    <li> love this lotion....gives the most amazing color!!!! would definitely buy again!! you will not be disappointed if you purchase this lotion.</li>
    <li> Has a good scent. Like the way it makes my skin feel. Gives good color. Price was too good to pass up! Great value for a good bronzing lotion!</li>
    <li> SEEMS TO WORK WELL AND SMELLS GOOD TOO!!</li>
    <li> After tanning it rubs off like a glue. Kinda weird. I go back and forth between the two different brands I have. Seems to tan good tho!!</li>
    <li> Gets you dark quick. Bad thing is it will stain your hands.</li>
    <li> Terrible it stains skin &amp; clothes</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic!!! I love the dark color I get, I couldn&#x27;t believe I could really tell a difference when I used it for the very first time on my already tanned skin. FANTASTIC product, Im pretty sure this one is my fave and will DEFINATELY be ordering it again and again!!</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Paint It Black\\&quot; lotion is great.  You can live with the aroma as a trade-off to the tanning affect and the moisturized skin.  A-Z always exceeds expectations for product and delivery.</li>
    <li> Used it for a month at tanning beds before vacation to a sunny island&lt;br /&gt;Not the results I anticipated.and hope I don&#x27;t burn while on vacation.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion twice since I received it this week. Both times I got compliments on my tan. A coworker seen me the day after I used it and immediately noticed the darker tan! My legs are very hard to tan and my other lotion (Smile your darker) was making them uneven. Solid Black makes them even and golden! I have never had this dark of tan on my legs before.  The only downside it the smell after tanning. The scent is nice when you first put it on but it smells \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; afterwards. This isn&#x27;t a huge problem for me since I usually tan later in the day or at night. I will deal with the smell because the deep dark tan out weighs the smell. :)  Again, Best lotion ever, at a great price!</li>
    <li> Hands down best lotion Ive ever used. Ive been tanning for years and recently gave this one a try, so glad I did! Highly recommend this one!</li>
    <li> I am a little concerned about the product i received.... i have been tanning for awhile now &amp; i received my product a couple days ago &amp; the color of the lotion doesn&#x27;t seem right!! it&#x27;s a very light creamy white color!! I&#x27;m begining to think i have been ripped off!! PLEASE let me know the color of the lotion you all have received so i know wether i have been scamed in to buying a bad product!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Warning: I&#x27;m completely orange after 3 uses. I look like I just rubbed myself with self tanner. It&#x27;s completely blotchy and around my joints (knees and elbows) it looks like I painted myself with some bad bronzer. Save your money.</li>
    <li> love this indoor tanning lotion very much it is great stuff .  i would highly recommend this product to every one</li>
    <li> I love to tan and do it every chance I get but I keep my tan looking very natural. Just got this product and used it today it is amazing, better than any product I have previously used. I&#x27;m going to order another bottle right now and I would highly recommend you do the same the price is more than worth it if you want to look great this summer!</li>
    <li> This is my first tanning lotion and I didn&#x27;t know what to think of it.I applied the cream and went tanning outdoors (I applied another lotion with SPF when going outdoors), and man did I tan! I went tanning for approximately 4-5hours, and I got at least 3 shades darker! The tanning line is VERY visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tan, I don&#x27;t turn golden or browner. I get \\&quot;blacker\\&quot;, so to speak, and this is because I am naturally tanned. So when I use this cream, it gets the perfect tanning effect for me - in darkens me in my natural way. Also, the smell is amazing, and makes me want to apply it even more :P. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. When you squirt some product out, it&#x27;s thick but when applying it to the skin, it smooths out, and feels water-like-solution and feels so light (and right, if you know what I mean). It kind of reminds me of velvet primer for makeup base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to get a couple of shades darker :). Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Well I got my order the next day witch is always a plus. I&#x27;ve ordered from them before and the service is always great. I started with paint it black witch gave me a great base then I used this and saw results the same day. Buy it is all I can say u won&#x27;t go wrong.  **********Update ***********  well after using this for a week I noticed that it makes u feel sticky afterwards and when I&#x27;m done tanning it leaves me dark but its streaky and when I take a shower I can see the lotion.  washing off in the tub and browning my towels. So its ooooooky nothing to write home to your mom about.</li>
    <li> i get super dark super fast with this product. i didnt like it at first but after using it for a long time its my go to lotion. contains alot of bronzers so wash your hands!</li>
    <li> this product is TERRIBLE! its more like a self tanner than a tanning lotion. I was streaky and orange after using it ONE TIME! Its watery and smells Ok but not like the reviews make it out to be! It says you&#x27;re saving 83% on this product but do not waste your money!Its not worth the 15 dollars I promise</li>
    <li> I love the smell big adding to my color..it falls short..the product was shipped fast to my house I just was looking for something to help keep me dark...</li>
    <li> It was okay.  I dont think I would order this product again.  The smell is okay but I didnt notice much of a difference tanning w/this.  I dont believe it has 100X bronzers in it.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for about 10 years now and have not found a lotion that will make me a shade darker in one tanning visit. Its very hard for me to get a base color when starting out in the summer. I have to tan at least 10 times to get a good, base tan. When i used Solid Black, I only had to tan twice to get to the color I wanted. I will for sure buy this lotion again! In the long run I will be saving money because I now have to tan less!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted a lotion to use for indoor tanning. I did NOT want a self tanner, which this is! If I wanted to look orange and have streaks all over me, I would buy a self tanner and skip the tanning bed. My skin looks disgusting and my hands are all stained now, in between my fingers. It does not say self tanner in the product description, it says &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34; which is misleading. Don&#x27;t buy this unless you want to look like an Oompa Loompa!!!! I am returning this product and will be more careful when I choose a different lotion to purchase.</li>
    <li> This lotion was a great choice really glad that I decided to listen to all the great reviews it has gotten and try it. I don&#x27;t tan easily so its always been hard for me to find a lotion that actually works. This lotion does after only three tanning sessions I seen a significant difference in my tan I was darker than ever. It smells great and works great. It&#x27;s also great for the price give it a try you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I can say that the bronzer worked well, except that it left streaks. You have to be careful to make sure you rub it in really good. The price is great here because in the salon it was about $25 more.</li>
    <li> This works great I have been useing it and it has got me darker then I was before I would bye it again I just love this lotion it smells great</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! Will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> Have used the lower version of rhis and produces a fantastic dark. long lasting dark tan</li>
    <li> Not sure why, but this didn&#x27;t work as well as other lotions I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I&#x27;m a 31 year old, Ashkenazi Jew (I&#x27;m just mentioning this so you&#x27;d know my skin type). and the progress I&#x27;ve seen has been very mild at best.</li>
    <li> My very white skin is finally able to get a nice tan with the help of this product.  The bronzes in it keep my tan for longer too.</li>
    <li> Works great just make sure you rub In evenly</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used !!!!</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> out of all the tanning lotions i&#x27;ve tried (which would be probably 30 different kinds) this has to be my absolute favorite. i know it&#x27;s for indoor use but i use indoor lotion outside for better color. anyway i bought this for my vacation for florida and dearrrrrr goddddd it got me so dark. im so happy. im never trying any other kind of lotion or band. love this stuff so much and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> smells very good and very moistuering !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;also price is best.i will get all sun lotion and moisture lotion forever with this seller !</li>
    <li> i highly recommend this lotion to anyone who is looking for a great deal. it gives you a great natural color, smells good, feels good, &amp; the price is great!! i must have this in my tanning arsenal to rotate every few days. its great for the high power, low time beds &amp; it lasts longer than any other product i&#x27;ve tried. for any hard core tanning crazies, this is a must have. try it, you&#x27;ll like it!!! great job millennium, this is a five star product!!</li>
    <li> Great deal!  It is a bronzing lotion and not a redding one however</li>
    <li> As a frequent tanner, I was using the 50x for a while and decided this year to try the 100x since the ratings were so high.  I started tanning about 2 weeks ago and I noticed on my legs and arms streaks where the bronzer had left behind.  I&#x27;ve tried to make sure everything is rubbed in really well when I apply the lotion but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. I&#x27;m hoping that once my tan builds up more it works better because I don&#x27;t feel like my skin has that &amp;#34;after-tan&amp;#34; smell when I leave like I would with other lotions.</li>
    <li> Gives a good, solid tan when used regularly.  I was impressed how my skin stayed moisturized and even smells great after the tan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different products including lotions that cost $50 on Amazon even. I have to say this stuff is better. You will get a darker tan using it. Just make sure to rub it in and wait the 3-4 hours after using it to shower and it darkens your tan a lot!</li>
    <li> I got this product a couple months back. I trusted the reviews that said it was great. The truth is I really do hate it. Its not a golden brown color when you apply it its like an orange color, and its very streaky. They also said it smells good. It don&#x27;t smell good at all. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again I hate it</li>
    <li> I saw the reviews and majority of the people liked it. I am a frequent tanner, and I like to try different types of lotions out. I usually go for the jwoww products but I wanted to step out of my shell, and the reviews seemed like it would be a decent enough of a product. Well the product is okay, I notice I get a lot of streaks here and there. It is just not my type of lotion, much rather still with jwoww products. Shipping was fast and efficient, I just probably wont ever buy it again. not my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT tanning lotion. I used to just use sun screen when in the tanning beds, until I bought this. I am SO much more bronzed now. I would definitely reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> Smells good and great price.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion twice now and I have already noticed that I have a good bronze glow. (I am very fair skinned) However, I am currently dealing with streaking issues. This really bothers me. Now, I have purchased a mitt applicator. Hopefully this will help because I like the color it&#x27;s leaving, not orange at all! Unfortunately, because of the terrible streaking on my arms and legs I will be using a different lotion until I try the mitt.</li>
    <li> My favorite tanning lotion.  I have been buying it for a few years.</li>
    <li> Turns your skin in golden brown is a very equal Sun Tanning Lotion some of the other ones</li>
    <li> This is the worst tanning lotion I have ever used. No bronzing what so ever. The smell after tanning is awful. It smells like burnt skin!!!!</li>
    <li> This is probably really great for a irregular tanner, the results weren&#x27;t as immediately noticeable for me... the orange residue it leaves is pretty bad too, so definitely wash your hands after. Overall tho, not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Great price and product, will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have used this several times before and love it. You can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, by boyfriend doesn&#x27;t though. It just smells like tanning lotion should without any perfume-y scent. It&#x27;s a product and it really helps darken you quickly, and it&#x27;s a great bargain.</li>
    <li> Gives a great tan....BUT turns you orange if you aren&#x27;t careful! On my first use inbetween my fingers was orange and my legs were streaky. I have used bronzers before so that wasn&#x27;t the issue. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again if given the choice.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but you must apply very evenly on your skin or you will have streaks.  The seller has very fast delivery.  I have ordered numerous times.</li>
    <li> I have used many millenium tanning lotions. This one is great, the bronzers get you a couple shades darker a in just 2 sessions, and I&#x27;m very fair skinned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning in beds year round for over 20 years. I am very dark but have tanerxia and no matter how dark I get i still feel white. I am skeptical about lotions, especially for $100. I purchased a sample of a $100 bottle for $10. HERES WHAT I DID!! For exactly 6 days in a row, I put the sample lotion only on my right leg and tanned for 6 days straight to see if there was a signifigant difference. Not only was there not a signigant difference, there was no difference at all. $100 bottles do not work. My mom tans as well and uses this product that she got through amazon. She has a deep dark moisturized tan. I was still skeptical, but I thought, wth, it&#x27;s only $13!!!!!!!! I just got it, and love it. Feel like I left the bed 2 shades darker instantly. DO NOT BUY expensive bottles at the tanning salons. This is just as good, if not better for only a 16th of the price. Recommend it highly!!!! I use the solid black 100x bronzing. I haven&#x27;t tested the theory out on my right leg with this product but maybe I shall. Either way, it&#x27;s good. Feel darker and moisturized. And for only $13 what the heck.</li>
    <li> I just got this product in the mail, 4 day early I might add, and I love it! I used it an hour after getting it and tanned for 15 minutes and I was so dark! I haven&#x27;t been tanning at all and I seriously was basically an entire shade darker! I like the smell and it left my skin so so so soft! This product can&#x27;t be beat! Plus the seller was fast! Will DEFINATELY be using them again!</li>
    <li> Great price and works great will be back to buy more when the time come to reorder. Great tanning product.</li>
    <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, it&#x27;s not your typical fruity/coco-nutty tanning lotion smell (it&#x27;s best described as unisex) so even guys could use it and doesn&#x27;t leave much of a ATO at all.  Plus it gets you DARK!  Sometimes I mix it with a tingle lotion for an extra boost but Solid Black works just great by itself!  If you&#x27;re looking for a great lotion without an overpowering smell or a bad ATO, and if you&#x27;re looking to get dark fast, I would highly recommend this lotion.  Just be sure to wash your hands afterwards because it does have a lot of bronzers in it.  Also, it&#x27;s not streaky at all; it gives you a nice even tan (not orange, either!).  It also leaves your skin very smooth due to the lotion containing silicone.  You will see quick results with this lotion, I promise!  Also, I received my lotion from this seller very quickly, 4 days before the estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> Left orange spots on my hands. It says to wash your hands after you apply,which I forgot because there isn&#x27;t a sink in the tanning room. Better remember if you don&#x27;t want weird orange between your fingers.</li>
    <li> Like it well used a couple bottles or so for my tanning during the summer it works very well thanks</li>
    <li> i ordered this product because of the high reviews and it dont dissapoint me either I noticed my base tan was 3-4 times darker after only 2 uses ,&lt;br /&gt;I put it onb at home about 1 1/2 to 2 hours before going to tan and , dont shower for about 2 hours after&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME...........</li>
    <li> This lotion really works to give you color! It gives noticeable and natural looking results. It is important to make sure to spread it evenly and remove excess from the palms and in-between the fingers because it can turn you orange. In addition, make sure that you do a skin test before using it, because I&#x27;ve encountered many people who have gotten small pink bumps from using this product. The product, in my opinion, smells very good. I use it for indoor and outdoor tanning. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Works great !</li>
    <li> seems to wash off after a bath or shower</li>
    <li> i love this lotion! smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, and tans amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Since I purchased this for my daughter, i gave it three stars.  She uses it and apparently likes it because she hasn&#x27;t stated differently.</li>
    <li> It helps gets my legs tanned. It also does not turn me orange. I will this product again for tanning.</li>
    <li> I was a avid Devoted Creations customer, until I read the reviews on this lotion. I&#x27;m currently 1/2 way though the bottle and I LOVE it! the smell is great, I don&#x27;t feel sticky afterwards, it absorbs quickly and zero streaking. This is a great lotion is you have already developed a little bit of a base tan.</li>
    <li> Works well for tanning beds.</li>
    <li> Ive always heard this lotion was good,the reveiws were good,so,I bought it.Tried it once so far,and,my hands were stained for 2 days,especially in between my fingers. It seemed to make me alittle bit darker,but,with it staining my hands for so long,Ill be passing on buying another bottle of it.</li>
    <li> Love it beautiful tan smells awesome not greasy</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve tanned three times and you can tell a huge difference between this and other products. It also smells great!</li>
    <li> I just received my order on Tuesday. I went and tanned with it yesterday. I came out smelling a weird smell. A few hours later I look and my feet are orange, my legs are streaky and had a horrific smell. I shook the bottle up very well. Thank goodness it didn&#x27;t turn my face orange or streaked my face. I will NEVER use this again. I asked the girls where I tan if they have heard of this product, they said no and to be VERY careful when buying online. They had a customer who bought a lotion online and it was laced with NAIR!! I will be glad to pay a higher price for something that won&#x27;t turn me into an ompa lompa and streak me. Very upset with this product!</li>
    <li> Great product, results are instant. Non greasy formula are beat even for acne prone skin. Just ordered it again. Love the results!</li>
    <li> First off, the smell is great. It smells like cologne- but its not over bearing. I used it once today and I am already a shade darker- I had already been tanning for a couple weeks so I had a base tan. I&#x27;ve used the Paint it Black before, but I prefer this so much more! Great product and I hope it continues to work!!</li>
    <li> Been using for a few weeks now. Great stuff. Only tan twice a week now! Good buy!!! Get some! Smells delightful :)</li>
    <li> It turned out excellent. I really love this tanning lotion. Its the best I have ever had! Thank you for the tanning lotion</li>
    <li> This product arrived in a pretty decent amount of time.  I havent been as pleased with it as I thought I would have been.  I have tried \\&quot;paint it black\\&quot; a couple times and found that it worked pretty well.  I do like the way this product helps with my dry skin and it did help me acheive a more gradual tan vs a burn.  I have used other products in the past that seemed to work better though.  Overall I would reccomend this product but keep in mind different lotions work differently for different people...</li>
    <li> I like it! The smell after tanning is pretty good. It&#x27;s easy to rub in. I think it&#x27;s a good lotion!</li>
    <li> The first week I began using Solid Black I noticed my skin starting to look splotchy and uneven. I am a very active person though, I teach dance and exercise vigorously everyday, so I do sweat a lot which could be one of the reasons the lotion doesn&#x27;t work well for me. Also the scent of the lotion is strange and starts smelling worse as time passes. Despite all that, the delivery was quick and the product is exactly as it is described online.</li>
    <li> Went back to this lotion after i tried others, in my third week of tanning with austrailin gold that wasnt getting me tan at all, and one time using this im a lot darker so this ones the best! Just wish it didnt smell like burnt plastic 😝</li>
    <li> I have purchased this previously. I like the tan color it gives me, has never looked orange. Great buy for the money. I also have psoriasis, so it keeps me mosturized while tanning and has never irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> best tanning lotion i have used! Just rememeber it has bronzers in it so rub it in evenly etc... i forgot and just kinda rubbed it here and there lol  works great, makes you tan faster, darker, and keep your skin nice and healthy</li>
    <li> It was for my wife she definitely darker and havent once heard her complaining about it so itcant be too bad</li>
    <li> Great price and smells nice! It seems to be working great. I tan&lt;br /&gt;easy though. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Im really pale and hard to tan. If thats you dont even waste your time or money on this product. It will only make you orange and streaky. Also if you dont wash your hands right after putting the lotuon on it turns in between tour fingers orange just like self tanner does.</li>
    <li> Got me 2 shades darker in one use and smells great. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Favorite lotion!! Just remember to wash your hands:)</li>
    <li> Gets you dark really fast!</li>
    <li> BUY THIS AND YOU WILL BRONZE YOURSELF..&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT. I USE THIS IN THE TANNING BOOTH AND AT THE ISLANDS TOO. JUST A GREAT ALL AROUND TANNING LOTION..</li>
    <li> It is a very good bronzer! Shows immediate results. When I got off I could tell it worked. I would recommend it for anyone who is in need of a fast tan. It does streak your hands  when applying it.. So be careful! But it works so good!</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion it gets the job done! I&#x27;m fixing to order my second bottle!! It&#x27;s the best so far!</li>
    <li> Lots of self tanner. if you dont rub it in well you will get &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; streaks. I got them between my toes and on the back of my arm. After i learned this i was just more careful and didn&#x27;t get any streaks. Gets you tan fast, just beware!</li>
    <li> i started using this product about two weeks ago, so far it&#x27;s working really well! it provides a deep brown tan and i didn&#x27;t get streaky either. my skin feels smooth and soft. it definitely has a strong smell. if you don&#x27;t like tropical smells i would not recommend it. overall a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a darker tan so quickly!</li>
    <li> It smells horrible, couldn&#x27;t wait til it was gone.</li>
    <li> Though this lotion has a scent for men I LOVE IT!!! Gives very quick bronze color!!! Not an orange color at all! It does have a &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; so gives a great color BUT I did notice after a shower, pool, beach etc some of the color would wash off. Never came off on clothes! Highly recommend for someone fair skinned looking for a great bronze color.</li>
    <li> Smells really good, nice bronzer.. It doesn&#x27;t make you look orange or anything. I have fair skin and an old at home tanning bed and this stuff still helps me get an awesome tan. Would order again!</li>
    <li> Have bought before love the 100 bronzing action for a deep dark tan will be buying again really love it</li>
    <li> I used this for the tanning bed. It did not make me that dark as I wanted but it smells good and does not leave any streaks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and it works very well. I get dark and if I can&#x27;t tan but once a week I stay dark and my tan does not fade as fast as in the past. I can tan once or twice a week and keep a nice dark tan. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning lotion. My husband swears by it. It goes on smooth, never streaks and has a great smell to it, we even bought some for our daughter and had it shipped to her. My husband will only use other lotion if he is out of this one. has super dark bronzers</li>
    <li> Good. Bronzer does leave some streaking good moisturizer though</li>
    <li> I love this product works great and smells good! After only tanning a few times I already see some color! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a great benefit in this for indoor tanning.</li>
    <li> Works great right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This.is so much better of a deal. At the tanning place these products are $40 and up.</li>
    <li> Tanning salons always rip you off if you buy lotion through them.. Solid black is so worth the $$.  Gives me an amazing color. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hands bronze at all like some others said, just wipe the palms of your hands off before you get into the bed.  Def will buy again.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion literally does nothing. I believe it is filled with regular lotion half way because the color is a very very light brown. I would not recommend this unless it was sitting in a tanning salon to be sure it is real.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned, so I need a bronzer when tanning.  I thought I would like this, but it turned me orange and before I had a chance to wash my hands after applying it quickly stained in between my fingers.  Pretty much any place on my skin that this lotion touched, it instantaneously turned my skin orange.  It also has a strong perfumey smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t doubt that this may work well for others, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for 16 yrs and I would not recommend this lotion for anyone who is used to being extremely dark. I didn&#x27;t see any results even close to what I normally get! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this particular bronzer. You can find better for a similar price! TRUST ME: these 5 star ratings are WAY OFF!!!</li>
    <li> this tanning lotion is good... Its not the tingly hot kind but itll get u dark... I kept my tan all summer long with this lotion...</li>
    <li> this product was pretty good! but like others say you have to rub in very well and you have to ignore your after tan smell. it gives good color and is worth the money i paid, but i dont think ill buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have olive colored skin so it&#x27;s hard to find a lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave me orange.  This stuff works great!  I noticed immediate brown color after one use and helps cut down on the after tan smell.  I have only used it a few times and have also paired it with Swedish Beauty Pink Diamond tingle lotion.  The combination seems to work well.  I just ordered another bottle of this.  Gotta stock up!</li>
    <li> I used this product once and tanned once and was very please with the results. Mainly because it helped even out mu tank top tan and tanned my shins that never seem to tan as much as my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the smell but not so much I would take a star away. I wish it smelled better but I can certainly live with it based on the results.</li>
    <li> This product worked quite well. I need to reorder, since I have already used it all.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is meant for tanning beds only, but I&#x27;ve used this while laying out by the pool and I get a pretty intense tan in a short amount of time. I love that it&#x27;s a lotion instead of an oil. Feels like it moisturizers which is a nice feeling. Personally, I love this stuff and it&#x27;s a great price to boot.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast service!</li>
    <li> Smells great: vanilla /almost coconut smell, smooth lotion-spreads easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands greasy. Makes you get dark quicker, and my boyfriend liked it too!</li>
    <li> It did not smell good at all, but a decent cheap lotion. I would not buy this lotion again just because it didn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
    <li> Amazing price compared to all the other high end tanning lotions at the salons, smells good, absorbs fast, I plan on sticking with this one for as long as I tan.</li>
    <li> This is a good starter lotion, it will get you a good base tan but not much more. I initially started tanning a few months ago with a different lotion the salon recommended but it made me really itchy so I bought this to try. I was impressed with the lotion at first. I immediately noticed I started getting color. Let me point out I&#x27;m naturally very pale, like deathly pale, and burned super easy (I burned my first session of only 4 minutes). Before now, I&#x27;ve literally never been tan in my life. I would burn and in a matter of days be a ghost again. This has a bronzer in it and when I was pale I could tell that made a difference. However, this lotion isn&#x27;t really doing anything for me anymore so I&#x27;m moving on. This lotion also has a mild after smell to it (I would think due to the bronzers), which I didn&#x27;t really like, but it wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to beginners and those with sensitive skin. This isn&#x27;t something that will get you super dark or &#x27;take you to the next level&#x27; but it will give you a good base which everyone needs. And the price is really awesome, obviously.</li>
    <li> This one is very good! Smells good, feels nice. Bought a second bottle for my sister as a gift and she equally loves it</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I ever used!  It took me 6 visits in an upgraded tanning bed to get a great base tan.  I did not get streaky like other users have complaned about and I am fair skinned too!  Like any other bronzer, wipe your palms and between your fingers after application and you will be good.  I have used this both indoor and at the beach and I am quite dark.  I have used other high end products and this is still the best lotion, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> so far I LOVE it. I am really pretty pale but I tan easily, and this has really boosted my skin. I haven&#x27;t had any issues turning orange or anything like that...and I am usually really hesitant of products with bronzes because I am so paranoid of being a &#x27;weird color.&#x27; I will continue to use this lotion as long as I tan. This lotion literally works better then my old holy grail that would cost me $100.00+ Per bottle.</li>
    <li> The smell of this lotion will win you over.  It&#x27;s like a delicately scented tropical escape that smoothes on gently and easily over your skin.  Be sure to apply it well, though.  I used it liberally and achieved a solid dark tan in just two use in regular tanning beds.  I&#x27;m French and Filipino, but rather pale.  This lotion did the trick. I look like I&#x27;ve spent weeks in the Tropics.  You will not be disappointed! I will never pay the price that tanning salons offer.  They sell this exact one for 5 times the cost.  Amazon offers a steal on it!!</li>
    <li> Great product and far cheaper than what the tanning salon rapes you for. It&#x27;s the exact same thing that my local salon has and half as much. Next time I will buy more than one bottle at a time to just have them on hand and ready.</li>
    <li> i used this product one time  and  it left streaks  all over  my  body !!!  very disappointed  in this  product , will not use or buy  again</li>
    <li> Great product. Bought once before and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love love love this lotion...was sun kissed and bronze after going to tanning bed 1st week...it will stain your hands so make sure u wipe hands immediatly after applying lotion but other than that no complaints and i would defenetly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> She has been tanning for a while for vacation and got this stuff the week before we left to the Caribbean. She hasn&#x27;t complained about it at all, and looked super dark about a week after using this. Her skin complexion is already dark, so I don&#x27;t know if this had anything to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She seems to like it though!</li>
    <li> It was good nice and thin and smells pleasant. overall a good product. I would purchase again. Not four stars because I don&#x27;t feel it gave me as good as color as some of the more expensive lotions - but for the price it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Great buy!! So much cheaper here than in the salon. I usually hate these lotions because of the over powering smell- but not this one. Covers and moisturizers well and I could tell a difference in my tan with just one session.</li>
    <li> Good lotion. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Did not help give me any color. I can get better results using nothing. Sent back.</li>
    <li> I read all the comments before purchasing.  They were all so incredibly positive.  I found that while it is &#x27;pretty good&#x27;, I didn&#x27;t find it any better than that.</li>
    <li> When only the deepest and darkest tan is required Solid Black is your only choice. Being tan is sexy. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Read some of the reviews, use it a couple of times, no problems with it what so ever. There&#x27;s no smell so I think.</li>
    <li> Caregiver for my wife uses this product. She loves it and it really works well on her. She looks like she has been in the sun for a long time.</li>
    <li> I prefer lotions with the tingle factor and heat.  It seems that these lotions bring the blood flow to the surface and helps with a better tan.  Maybe it&#x27;s in my head.  I decided to go with one that didn&#x27;t have a tingle factor and went with Solid Black.  For the price I liked it.  No tingle and produces a really really dark tan.  I would use this again as a back up to Trinity 3.</li>
    <li> I use it for my in between of tinglers and I love it.  No it isn&#x27;t going to take you from extremely pale to extremely dark overnight, but it does give good color.  Smell isn&#x27;t bad either.  I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> You can see a difference within two to three uses. The bronzer shows on the first use! It even smells amazing. ♡♡♡</li>
    <li> I tanned for 1 whole week with this lotion and you would think that i was tanning for months before hand! and it smells so good, better than most tanning lotions!</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Repeat buyer of this product.</li>
    <li> Definitely my favorite tanning lotion and believe me I&#x27;ve tried everything. Smells great and gets me nice and dark.</li>
    <li> Delivery was early. Product exactly the same as a salon. But at 50% less!!! I will buy again, using PRIME.</li>
    <li> Saw color after first use! Great product and doesn&#x27;t make you orange.</li>
    <li> This works pretty good and smells good I ordered online so I didn&#x27;t have to pay crazy prices at a tanning place and glad I did but if not rubbed in good u will have some orange spots.</li>
    <li> love the deepness of the tan you can get with this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything so quick before! After ONE TAN I saw a difference. I never write reviews for anything but this I had to. This is a must buy if you&#x27;re looking for a nice, even, tan. Watch out for those streaky fingers though! Use a towel after applying to get it off of the finger cracks, it works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying this forever! GET IT. GET IT NOW. DO IT. YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Buyers beware! This is an extreme 100x bronzer. Two tans and I started to get so dark i actually switched lotion. I wanted a boost but this stuff is like ridiculous with bronzer. Sometimes isnt always a good thing!</li>
    <li> I was paying $60+ at my tanning salon for similar lotions. I tried this stuff and it works great. Maybe too good, I was getting a little too dark haha.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on redheads</li>
    <li> Great product, saw results right away!</li>
    <li> Worked well...results were immediate.I got 2 bottles for way less than the price for one at the tanning salon. Including shipping</li>
    <li> Greatest stuff ever! I can not bring myself to buy an expensive product at my salon. If you want to be tan just after one use this is the product for you!!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. I like the smell, it&#x27;s cheap and the bottle is big. It makes my tan look nice. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVEEE this lotion!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ It smells amazing and finest leave a burnt smell after! It&#x27;s not a super dark bronser. It&#x27;s got a little bit in it but not too much to leave streaks! My new favorite! Will definitely be purchasing again!!!</li>
    <li> Worked better than I expected. Will buy more when I run out. Will recommend to anyone looking for a great lotion</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Tingle lotions often make me itch so I prefer to use non-tingle. I obviously still want to get a decent tan without getting burnt or spending hours in the tanning bed. This product does just that. It has a nice bronzer in it that doesn&#x27;t leave you streaky or orange. It works for me on the first use, smells great, and has a great price from this seller as well.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product I was pretty skeptical because of the reviews. The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as some lead on. It doesn&#x27;t smell like your typical coconut tanning lotion, no, but it&#x27;s definitely not an offensive smell either. I quite enjoy it. Just beware to wash or wipe your hands after applying due to the autobronzer in it!</li>
    <li> For tanning lotions being $100+, you cannot beat getting lotion at this price.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion worked just as well as any other super expensive tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I get so dark with this. Always priced right. I recommend this to anyone who tans.</li>
    <li> Awesome tanning lotion! This stuff works great. This was my first bottle and I would highly recommend it to anyone. My skin didn&#x27;t burn like with some the other lotions I&#x27;ve used. It tanned evenly and nicely.</li>
    <li> If I wanted to self tan I would have got a diffrent product. On top of that the smell AFTER tanning was horrible? Scent was fine pre-tanning. There was nothing I liked about this product. Save your money and buy a diffrent brand. I tossed in the trash it was so bad</li>
    <li> I like the lotion. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite but used it until it was gone but wont buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the price but not the product. I&#x27;ve been tanning for at least a month and I haven&#x27;t seen any different. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough bronzer in it. And the smell is ok. Not too bad but you still smell like tan if you don&#x27;t wash it off.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Love the bronzer.  Smells good.  Feels good.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She hates it. Left streaks all over her body. Didn&#x27;t help with tanning at all.</li>
    <li> Great results! Just make sure you wipe your hands and fingers after applying or you will end up with orange strips. Will order again!</li>
    <li> This product gives a beautiful golden brown tan. However, it is not streak free. I feel like I apply it evenly and rub it in, but I&#x27;m still ending up with bad and very noticable streak marks.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best indoor tanning bronzer I have ever used. If there is something better out there let me know- as far as I can tell this is the best there is out now.</li>
    <li> Great item as described fast shipment</li>
    <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t believe all these reviews that said it worked so well so I just had to try it myself. It was only like 15$ so I didn&#x27;t have much to lose right? Anyway, this product worked miracles on me. After two visits to the tanning bed my skin is noticeably tanner. Something I realized was don&#x27;t shower directly after tanning, let the bronzes kick in! I woke up the next day and was so shocked at the darkness of my skin!</li>
    <li> Enjoy product, I don&#x27;t get as dark as I thought I would but love the tone that it provides, does not look fake or make you look orange as some do.</li>
    <li> Sorry tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased better. but for this price on Amazon it is worth it being I&#x27;ve paid 4 times as much for the same bottle at salons.</li>
    <li> Great lotion all around comparable to designer skin just make sure you take care to clean off hands after application as you may notice a slight orange look days later</li>
    <li> Works well as it contains a little bronzer.  Most effective when used sparingly. Be sure rub well into skin to avoid color streaks.&lt;br /&gt;Like most bronzer/tanners it may leave residual color on necklines so be sure to wipe off neck after tanning.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I would give 0 stars if I could. DO NOT BUY. I got this yesterday, used it yesterday and it turned me orange and I have blotchy brown spots! I did not apply this any differently than my typical lotion. I am upset that I didn&#x27;t just buy my usual that I love (because it&#x27;s so much more money than this, but I guess you get what you pay for). This has to be a fake because it&#x27;s not at all what it says. It didn&#x27;t come sealed. Horrible lotion! Do not use!</li>
    <li> Just after two times of using this I am already seeing results. The smell is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad smell after tanning. Leaves my skin super soft! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Used it 3 times.  Big difference</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a thing for me. One star, the second star is for the smell of it, smell quite nice.</li>
    <li> I am hispanic so have naturally pretty dark skin, all this did was make me an orange color. Left blotches and streaks all over my body. I&#x27;ve only used it twice and have a full bottle left and will NEVER touch it again.</li>
    <li> This works great and has a nice smell. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years, and will continue to use as long as it is sold. It gives you a bronze look, not the orange look that most give.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  I&#x27;ve tanned for years &amp; tried numberous lotions.  This one gives awesome color, smells great &amp; feels wonderful on my skin.  Will be buying again!!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. I guess I got a funky bottle :( lame! Won&#x27;t order tan lotion online again.</li>
    <li> This product worked well, I got darker instantly, the only bad thing was the burnt smell after you have tanned.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this lotion.  It is not flowery like most others.  The bronzer does its job but can leave streaks if you do not rub it in well.</li>
    <li> Best lotion Ive ever used even with hundred dollar competitors. I tanned faster than ever. great smell. works perfectly and with a price that just cannot be beat. wont use any other product for tanning on the body.</li>
    <li> This product works as it says. It gives you a dark tan look the first time you try it. It also smells really good, I put it on in the morning and tan at night it has had time to soak in the skin and gives your a really deep glow.</li>
    <li> The shipping was quick and was received on time. I&#x27;ve used this lotion for a little over a month with frequently indoor tanning sessions and receive a little extra color from this product. Also you still have that nasty burnt skin scent after tanning even when wearing this product though the sent of the lotion before tanning is very good!</li>
    <li> I am a amazon prime member, so i get the two day shipping, I actually got this the day after i placed my order so i was very excited about that.This lotion has a nice fresh scent.. feels super silky on skin. Im naturally pretty tan, so its hard for me to get a tan but this is working nicely</li>
    <li> I love this lotion it goes on great and smells good. It gives a great color and quickly will continue to purchase this lotion over others. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I love it! I use this and then Forever After All Day Moisturizer and Australian Gold Body Kisses Daily Moisturizer. The 3 work perfect together!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is a good value and works well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is smells kind of weird and the smell stays on you and your clothes all day</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t have that burnt smell and leaves me with a nice golden color, not orange like a lot of bronzers.  A little goes a long way too which makes it economical too.</li>
    <li> me and my boyfriend both use this lotion. I love it so much. I got a really good deal on it to., Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Having tried many tanning bed bronzes, this is by far the best. No odor,  skin is not dry, and it really does help to give you that just off the beach natural bronze.</li>
    <li> This is in reference to the product, not the seller. This is one of those brands that leaves the stains on your fingers, hands and feet. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> This came in the mail quicker than expected, so I went straight to the tanning bed to try it out. I could not be more satisfied with this purchase. I have naturally very pale skin, and have been on and off tanning for almost a month so I had a very light base tan. This bronzer worked wonders and gave me a very natural darker tone. Would recommend this to anyone who is looking to get dark fast!</li>
    <li> Best stuff all around!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It creates a beautiful dark/bronze tan! It does not make you orange! And smells wonderful too! I highly suggest this lotion :)</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, feels amazing. The best 100x bronzer I ever used. It definitely will not make you orange. Can be used by men or women. Not a strong scent, it&#x27;s a clean flower type scent.</li>
    <li> Here in Tampa Bay we have Devoted and this company as well.  Tanning is a big deal.  I&#x27;ve used pretty much every lotion out there, from tingle down.  This 100x is the strongest available to my knowledge and the scent is pleasant.  Works better than the more expensive brands, hands down.  Do make sure you use a towel to wipe between your fingers and such before tanning since it will darken ... its that good!</li>
    <li> Product did what it said it would and Bronzed up my skin also the price was way better than what local tanning salons were asking for.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Will always get it ! I&#x27;ve got both of my daughters using it. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I typically use Designer Skin, but I saw this and bought it because it was cheaper than one I was looking at. It made me completely orange even with a base tan, so it shouldn&#x27;t be one to use every day. You also have to make sure you put it on evenly or else you will have tons of streaks. Needless to say, I am back to Designer Skin products.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!! I think it works great and it smells good to !!! Will be ordering it again !!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  The bronzer works great.  I have somewhat fair skin so I like that using a lotion with a bronzer so I can spend less time in the tanning bed but still have a good tan.  This is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a decent lotion. It gives a nice light bronze from the bronzer. I truly did not realize this was a bronzer. I thought it just meant you go a deep, dark tan. This will turn your fingers and feet a tiny bit organge/brown if not rubbed in just right. I do like the bronzer, it really helps if you do not get dark enough on certain areas of your body. I do not get dark on the top of my thighs and this helped give me more color.  I do not see a huge increase in a tan. I had been going to the tanning salon 4-5 times a week for 2 months before using this. I had been using a really cheap lotion before. . It did help but did not give me a deep tan. I had upgraded to the nicest bed. This is better than nothing at all and the very cheap lotions but this just helps a little. I was hopeful this would be comparable to a more expensive Black lotion that sells for 3 times as much in the salon. If you are on a budget this is a decent lotion but if you are needing a deep dark tan for something special...spend the extra money on good quality. This is just okay. It might work for someone who is already naturally dark but not for your average white girl.</li>
    <li> Smells good, moisturizes and the color you get after one session of tanning is outstanding! Your skin feels soft...very good product</li>
    <li> item is great but shipping method needs improvement.  box arrived and didn&#x27;t have a single piece of tape on the box. with a hard shaking the item easily fell out of the box.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected at all</li>
    <li> Make sure you wipe your hands after applying. Just like other tanning creams/ lotions, it will make them orange. Get between the fingers too. Second application noticed the biggest change.</li>
    <li> Have bought this before and will continue to buy it, works great&lt;br /&gt;and even after one use you can see the difference Love It !!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Microcell, too. Not too strong.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion.  It&#x27;s cheap and it works wonderfully.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  Definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> This is a great bronzing lotion at such an incredible price! No more buying from the salons for me!!! I bought 4 bottles of lotion for under the cost of 1 bottle at my salon!</li>
    <li> Loveeeee ittttttt....it&#x27;s my favorite kind of tanning lotion. It&#x27;s a great bronzer and has a awesome smell too.</li>
    <li> Great product. Have used it for over a year!! It gives a great tan and really maximizes the effect of the tanning beds!!</li>
    <li> Did not like the product it left me orange marks everywhere on my body after tanning!! Don&#x27;t buy go for a better one</li>
    <li> works great. smells amazing! definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This runs out of the bottle like water. Waaay too liquidy. Slides of my hands before I can even apply! I bought this lotion over others because sooo many high ratings but is a fake or super expired... lol Don&#x27;t pick something just because of ratings. Lesson learned! Lol</li>
    <li> I really like this bronzer.  It is not messy, applys well and evenly, and gives an even tan.  I can&#x27;t get it as evenly applied on my back and I can tell the difference when looking at my chest versus my back.</li>
    <li> My first time using tanning lotion. Really works. My arms and face always tan without any problem but my legs stay ghostly pale no matter how much sun they get. I&#x27;ve only been using for a couple weeks and my legs have a nice bronze for the first time in my whole life. I&#x27;ll be using it all summer. Smells nice. Not greasy. Makes my skin feel sooo smooth!  Have been using it for outdoor tanning, not tanning bed. Only complaint is that my tan is coming in a little on the orangy-side. With a name like Solid Black I guess i was expecting a darker undertone.</li>
    <li> excellent price and nice tan</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave orange color on your skin like most bronzing lotions.  It was a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product, didn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this lotion.After three times of tanning and no color.I resorted back to my old bottle of a cheaper type,at least with it,I got some color.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a month ago and I like it. If you are looking to get really tan this is the lotion for you! I didn&#x27;t burn with it and you can see results right after you get done tanning. Only reason why I gave it four stars is because the smell could be a lot better. It doesn&#x27;t smell good and leaves a bit of an order afterwards. Also doesn&#x27;t have a great moisturizer. Make sure you moisturize your skin after, so your skin doesn&#x27;t get dry. If you have any dry skin and use this tanning lotion it will leave behind brown spots. But I&#x27;m pretty sure thats what happens with all other lotions as well. So just make sure your elbows, ankles, and hands are every moisturized and not dry. I probably won&#x27;t buy this lotion again just because I&#x27;m pale and looking for more of a natural look!</li>
    <li> This is like smelly water.</li>
    <li> Only bronzer. Doesn&#x27;t help with tan</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more like a self tanner</li>
    <li> Great smell and gives you a great color. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I will not buy this again! I normally use Paint it Black 50x and thought I was ready for a bump up (I&#x27;m pretty pale but now have a nice base) and this is absolutely horrible. Oh sure, I&#x27;m crazy tanner than before, but it&#x27;s mainly orange. It definitely hasn&#x27;t helped me tan better, it&#x27;s just the auto darkening technology. Even using wipes to clean my hands after application my palms, webs of fingers, and elbows are all orange along with some streaks on my arms and legs. I&#x27;ve used this about 5 times, but it&#x27;s going in the trash now... Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I only have to tan 3 days a week instead of my usual 5 days to maintain my level of desired darkness with the Solid Black Lotion.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Great product for price point!  Gets you tan, and that&#x27;s the point right?</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! I looked tan after 3 sessions. No streaking and smells like normal tanning lotion. Large bottle for a great price.</li>
    <li> FAKE&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely nothing happened when using this&lt;br /&gt;And I am familiar with the tanning bed and lotions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definetly don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff....  It tans great and leaves you skin soft.  I usually tan in the evenings and leave the lotion on over night so the bronzer can do it&#x27;s thing.  There is a slight order in the morning. it&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s noticeable. Other than that, amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> By far the best tanning lotion I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Left my skin feeling soft, tanned and hydrated for the most part.  Not a heavy smell, but a little.  I ordered another lotion as well, to see which one I like.  I am partial to this one. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Stuff sucks!  Not worth buying&lt;br /&gt;Junk. Again it&#x27;s junk not worth anything&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and like most cheap stuff it&#x27;s junk</li>
    <li> kinda leaves film on you.. and washes most the tan away when you shower. even days later. and doesn&#x27;t really accelerate</li>
    <li> This is a really good tanning product without the very expensive tanning salon price. I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> but now my legs are a normal, non-blinding color and that&#x27;s after a single use. I was using &amp;#34;black storm&amp;#34; also from millennium tanning and that worked just fine after a while but this did it the first time. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, so I don&#x27;t know if the color gets funny if you use it alot but right now I&#x27;m very happy to be a uniform shade of not-pink or white.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend purchased this lotion to use at the tanning salon. The item was priced very well, compared to other lotions that i&#x27;ve seen advertised. She said it worked great and had a nice smell as well. The item arrived on time and was as described by the seller. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs tanning lotion, but does not want to spend a lot of money in the process.</li>
    <li> Hated this. Leaves skin really orange.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m on the fence about this lotion. On the one hand I am getting nice color and it smells great when applying. HOWEVER! It will leave orange streaks in your hands and anywhere else you don&#x27;t rub it in completely. Also it is leaving stains on any article of clothing it touches. Also you smell  cooked after tanning...so don&#x27;t try to go do anything else before you shower.</li>
    <li> works awesome just make sure to wash your hands</li>
    <li> I had a very hard time avoiding blawchy spots...even hours after use id find darker fingers, ancles, toes and even some times random spots like once a crease rite across my tummy that was embarassing!</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and thought I would try this lotion I was not disappointed.  Goes on the skin nice and smooth no streaking, smell nice when you put it on and after tanning.  The price is great it is hard to pay $60 or more for tanning lotion and this is better than some I have used at that high price or more.  I would recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I like this product for the price, I get good color and moisture but it could smell a little better</li>
    <li> I tried several different products before this one. I was having a hard time getting my shins to tan. It was quite ridiculous! I finally got some color using Solid Black.  It worked great for me. It also has a pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> This lotion did not smell so good. It was ok to put on but didn&#x27;t have the bronze color or make me tan. I would not but it again.</li>
    <li> I love this bronzer/lotion. My salon sells other products I&#x27;ve tried for 6x the price of this one. I&#x27;ve even tried one of their favorites, I went right back to this one! I love it because: It smells good, it bronzes beautifully, it&#x27;s not streaky (wipe your hands after you apply, duh), and I can wear it all day with no sticky residue! Other lotions I have to go home and shower afterwards to remove the slime layer and half my tan. Nope, this is it for me, I won&#x27;t use any other. Soooo good!</li>
    <li> Great bronzer. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am not really satisfied with this product. I had another brand that I have been using before this purchase that was almost expired and it worked better than this. i am surprised as this one is supposed to have a bronzing enhancer included and I am still waiting to see it. Like the bottle and the logo, but the product is just so-so.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was so much less than at the tanning salon I go to.  The tanning salon I go to said that when I buy products on line that aren&#x27;t from a reputable supplier, then I may not be getting the real thing.  I didn&#x27;t believe them since the savings was so much. I was very disappointed when the product came out somewhat watery, clumpy and smelled \\&quot;odd\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m starting to believe what the salon said.  Just one of those things that you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion gets me the most tan. I have tried many other bronzing lotions and tingle lotions but this is my favorite. It does leave an uncomfortable smell right after tanning but it&#x27;s something I can get used to.</li>
    <li> I have bought at least 3 brands at tanning salon and spent $60 to $80 for each,thought I would try amazon this was amazing 1 tan session 12 minutes I looked tanner than 3 or 4 sessions with expensive stuff. No orange just brown and I am blonde and fair. Won&#x27;t buy salon again.</li>
    <li> Good but stains hands orange</li>
    <li> Having used more expensive tanning products in the past i was skeptical from the price. Have been using it for the last 2 months and so far no streaks and my hands are not orange yet i have been able to get back my tan faster than with others i have tried. am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> My favorite tanning lotion!!! Smells wonderful and I get dark fast. the price is so affordable!  Not to mention I just this outside also and I get great results</li>
    <li> Works great. It smells great, it don&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky and the bronzer don&#x27;t stink...I would recommend this bronzer.</li>
    <li> Love this product! You definitely get a lovely color out of it. But I always get streaks. As much as I would rub it in, somehow I always had streaks. Not very noticeable to anyone else though. Will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> Smells good, great even results! Will buy again for sure!!</li>
    <li> At first it was good.  A pretty color pretty quick.  But then you take a shower and it seems to disappear down the drain.  A spray tan last longer on body.  I guess the best is go in with nothing at least it want disappear in a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Smells great, leaves skin feeling nice and smooth after use (which is a plus after working out and using the tanning bed before showering).</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It has a pleasant smell and I get super dark with it. It is a good product at a good price. I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Really helped with my tanning experience!</li>
    <li> Really helped me get a great tan.</li>
    <li> Good lotion. Smells nice</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have a beautiful tan after 2  uses. This product gives a natural  tan not booth.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> not bad for that price</li>
    <li> Have only used 3-4 times, but pleased so far with results. Followed recommendations to wipe hands clean after applying, so have had no problem with staining.  Nice smell, love the immediate &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to skin after applying, even before tanning bed. The price ROCKS, compared to buying in a salon!!!</li>
    <li> Great product great smell and best of all price is slam dunk better than my tanning salon which sells it for 3 times the price</li>
    <li> Not a good tanning lotion at all, I was very upset with the quality of the product. It does turn you orange and the orange stain does not come off! It has to wear off! I am 1/2 Native American so I already have a nice base tan and it still turned me orange. I will never buy this product again!</li>
    <li> A good lotion. I don&#x27;t personally use it. I bought it for my fianc&amp;eacute; and he seems to like it. Just be sure to rub it in well or it will stain.</li>
    <li> Gives a great dark bronze color! I&#x27;m olive skin toned naturally but usually start to tan in February to prepare my skin for summer. It&#x27;s hard to find an inexpensive indoor lotion that actually works!</li>
    <li> I dont tan very well and i noticed a difference after 3-4 uses !! love it!!</li>
    <li> I was happy with the price of this tanning lotion as well as its quality bronzing effect. I am hoping to order more soon!</li>
    <li> Tried yesterday in the tanning bed. Didn&#x27;t know it was a tanning dye though. Make no mistake, this stuff works just make sure you apply it EVENLY or it will leave extra tan streaks and blotches. Live and learn as the saying goes. I&#x27;ll be smarter next tanning session and  it won&#x27;t make you smell flowery and fruity like so many of the others.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, which hides the tan bed odor. Bronzing effect is visible, but bot overwhelming. Good product for its price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the lotion multiple times and dont see much results.  I tan better without using this lotion.  I would recommend using a different lotion if possible.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my tan darker than any other lotion I have tried. The smell is really good as well, it doesn&#x27;t smell like that normal just got done  tanning smell. I love it!</li>
    <li> I loved this lotion because it darkened me up quick. This lotion smells nice and has a good feel to it with no greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Turns you orange! Not a good look for summer at all!! Very disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work as good as the other ones</li>
    <li> Works really great I love how quickly my tan has progressed since I started using this lotion. Would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> Make sure you rub it in well.. or else you will have a streak! Plus, it doesnt smell very good..</li>
    <li> I was warned by my tanning salon about purchasing this stuff online. After that I was pretty skeptical. Low and behold though I got legit lotion that works good. Incredible price</li>
    <li> Paint it Black 100 is hands down the best tanning lotion I have ever used. It&#x27;s amazing the color you get!!</li>
    <li> This will give you a really Dark Tan quick.&lt;br /&gt;I had many comments about my tan in a positive way.</li>
    <li> Solid Black is the best tannin bed bronzer I have ever tried. I love the fragrance and my tanning results were perfect. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This lotion was cheaper than anything you can buy in the tanning salon and works just as well. really nice bronzer</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever bought.... Works great when using a tanning bed.... Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Does the job and smells pretty good too! This brand is moderately priced and works just as well as others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this lotion 3x now.. It&#x27;s a great price and the seller ships it fast.. It ALWAYS comes before the estimated arrival date. The lotion itself is AWESOME! I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and I can honestly say nothing has gotten me as dark and works as quickly as this does! Can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality of the product! Very satisfied (:</li>
    <li> Best ever. Received it quickly too. I was very dark after tanning 3 times. Make sure you wash your hands after applying.  I love this product!!</li>
    <li> Smells good &amp; tans to a good color</li>
    <li> This stuff worked really well got a lot dark then I thought I would</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and dont usually tan very well, but after using this I had a very dark tan an never orange! After using this I also was able to tan much better out in the sun. I definately reccomend this product!</li>
    <li> Run smooth all over your body leaving my skin moisturizer, really good to keep your tan all year.</li>
    <li> The same quality as products sold in tanning salons but for much less money.</li>
    <li> Works fast to get you a dark tan! Perfect for trying to boost your tan! Only for experienced tanners.</li>
    <li> amazing tanning lotion and good company too.</li>
    <li> Love this amazing color!</li>
    <li> Buy this!!  Works well and doesnt have a strong smell.  Used this to get ready for my honeymoon and I got tan as expected.  Will purchase again.  My husband even loved it!</li>
    <li> turns your hands orange, stains your nails orange, I was expecting more based on the description. it does smell good though, maybe it&#x27;s good for outdoor tanning</li>
    <li> As a guy i appreciate a nice tan tookis so that being said it seemed to work on my ex.</li>
    <li> It gives a great color but you have to.apply everyday. The bronzer will show even if you don&#x27;t tan. It does rub off onto clothes. So if you don&#x27;t mind applying everyday you will have a good looking tan</li>
    <li> I used this indoor tanning for over a week, i would look dark at first but any sine of water and it all washes off. it didn&#x27;t work on me at all.</li>
    <li> I am not very impressed with this lotion</li>
    <li> Yes! Finally a tanning lotion that not only makes me darker but also smells great! Let me start by describing my skin type... I&#x27;m usually pretty white and it&#x27;s really hard for me to tan. When I do tan, I burn a little first and then it turns, somewhat, into a tan- with lots of help from tanning lotions and many hours in the sun. I originally bought this for indoor tanning salons, but decided to use it as tanning oil by the pool also and it&#x27;s a great idea! I even put a little but of sunblock on certain areas on my chest where I know I burn a lot and then put this lotion over it. NO BURNS, JUST DARKER! I now use this for any tanning purpose :)&lt;br /&gt;I usually am very sensitive to the scent of other tanning lotions especially when it mixes with a little sweat...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference tanning as far as color. I can tell a HUGE difference as far as the bronzer. I think the bronzer makes my legs look a little too orangish. I am not talking orange full on but I definitely think it could use more red hues to it. I will not be purchasing again because of the bronzer in it. I know it is not my skin tone either because I tend to have a more red hue any way.</li>
    <li> I used this bronzer on Tanning bed and it worked perfect. It has more like a neutral smell. Easy to apply and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been tanning in years so I was excited to get back into the beds. I like to have that dark bronze tan so I was on the look out for a high rated lotion without the salon price. I saw this with amazing reviews and an amazing price to match. I have used this for about 2 weeks and although it has made me a little darker, it didn&#x27;t work miracles. For around $14.00 its not a bank breaker and it will do a hint of bronzing and color. But if you&#x27;re like me and want a deep bronzing tan, go elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!! Have several compliments on how dark i am. Had some to inquire on what I was using. I definitely recommend it to others</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to feel about this. Yeah it gives good color but about 3 out of the 5 times I used it I was left with streaks.</li>
    <li> This was what I expected , no harsh smell or orange residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great! Bring on my Tan!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Good coverage, not much streaking.  With summer coming, don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll use it much, but Great product, great price and excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> I loved this bronzer. It did the trick. It has a nice and light smell. I would reccommend for others to try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for a very long time, 8-10 years probably. I&#x27;ve tried every big name lotion and even the no-name kinds. This particular brand was decent but it never got me any darker than I normally would get (I&#x27;m Italian so I tan easily and quickly). I was not a fan of the scent, I smelled mostly the bronzer and it was a weird smell that didn&#x27;t wash away to easy. I would not recommend this product unless there was a significant price drop. It just wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Great color too.&lt;br /&gt;No tingle factor at all -&lt;br /&gt;Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this lotion. But when I received it, it was completely liquified and had a sour smell to it. Being an experienced tanner and previous PBT employee, I know that &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; or liquefying tanning lotion ruins it. I&#x27;m very familiar with silicone lotions, and this stuff just felt like junk you&#x27;d get from Walmart. Hopefully it just got ruined in a hot truck or warehouse, and is not as bad as how I received it.</li>
    <li> Being a member of the U.S. Olympic Tanning Team I find that Solid Black gives me an edge over my competitors and one step closer to the Gold Medal … all kidding aside I’ve been tanning indoors on level 5 for about 20 years I haven’t found a lotion as good as this one. In addition to providing a deep bronze tan it helps in moisturizing my skin (no ash scaling at all), the scent is fresh and not overwhelming (being a man this is an issue I’ve had with a lot of lotions on the market) and the price is hard to beat (it blows the salons out of the water). I would recommend this product to rookies &amp; veterans alike just make sure to clean your hands after applying boy’s n girls because the bronzer will stain your palms as they all do.  Blue Skies</li>
    <li> I have bought this exact tanning lotion off of amazon several times before.. It works very quickly, and you get a nice deep tan.. It had never given me an orange glow, only a solid tan look.. Also, its a really good lotion to use if you can&#x27;t shower soon after going tanning. It doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, or leave you feeling all sticky and gross. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> After reading the pros and cons, I bought this stuff because the price was affordable. This stuff works good for the price. I definitely get color from using the product. The only discoloration that could happen to your skin when using this product is if you do not apply it evenly, and that is the case regardless of what product you are using. I have always wiped my hands after application, it only makes sense to remove the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; that settles between your fingers. I will definitely re order when I need more!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The bronzing part is very natural.  It has a great scent.  Highly recommend this product to other people.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! It smells nice and I think it really gave me a nice color. I got a lot of compliments on my tan when I started using this.</li>
    <li> Will not be buying this again. Looking for something different after using it only 3 times. Turns my hands orange especially in between my fingers no matter what I do to try and prevent it. Also leaves streaks on my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> Very god product. Can definitly tell the difference between having it on and not. I get a deep brown color from it.</li>
    <li> I  just wanted to say that I also have been a &#x27;professional&#x27; tanner for over 7 years now (mine is due to health issues and the heat from the tanning bed is why I started to begin with the tanning bed due to my disease,)  and found it was not only drying me out so horribly it was unreal!, but that I also figured if I was going to use the darn thing I might as well get a nice tan with it. lol) But, back to the comment, I tried every lotion I could including the after tan skin moisturizers as we all know just how drying tanning beds are to our skin especially if we can&#x27;t seem to find the right lotion for our personal skin type, not to mention, unfortunately, they really DO cause you to look older after using the tanning beds for so long, ( you know the saying &#x27;leather skin&#x27; ? )  and NOTHING I used helped! When I first tried this, the man that owned the salon knew me for 3 years (along with the painful disease I have)  and GAVE me a packet to try and it was the first time that (for one, I have awful stretch marks from my 2 kids on my belly that I could never get to tan) my stretch marks were so noticeably tanned and less visible after just the 1 use, but also, it was the first time I didn&#x27;t itch from dry skin when I got home! I have my own tanning bed at home now, and I am a FAITHFUL user of Solid Black, just because I can even use it just as a daily Lotion, but I also keep 2 others at all times for back ups. Those are, Paint it Black (here is a link to it  http://www.amazon.com/Millenium-Tanning-Paint-Auto-darkening-Lotion/dp/B00147FGJ8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1405476580&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;millenium+tanning+lotion&amp;tag&#x3D;donations09-20  (the one that is only the 50X bronzer in the black bottle (NOT THE NEW ONE in the YELLOW BOTTLE  Called Paint it BEYOND Black Millenium Bronzer 100 XXX! BEWARE OF IT!!! IT IS BAD NEWS And will streak you to heck and back!!)  And the other is Black &amp; Tan, and again here is the link for IT in case you want to see it ( http://www.amazon.com/Millennium-Tanning-BRONZER-ACCELERATOR-Stickers/dp/B00L8GFJJC/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_9?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1KCT213BCXQ7ZTJ66C7B&amp;tag&#x3D;donations09-20 )  which is 75x bronzer. JUST incase you ever decide or have your own bed, (as I have learned quickly, that you should always have a back up bottle of something lol) Those other 2 are just as awesome and give the Same awesome results! Just wanted to let you know incase you ever want something that&#x27;s by the same company AND works not only good by it&#x27;s self, but also you can mix them. (I got even darker and more evenly tanned by using the Solid Black just on my legs for a week while using the Black and Tan on my upper body :) Hope that helps anyone out. I have now been using this ( well all 3 OF THESE ) for almost 2 and 1/2 years now. And I have noticed a HUGE difference in the &#x27;leather skin&#x27; look from the tanning which is the biggest PLUS of all! :)  And don&#x27;t forget you can take them ALL POOLSIDE too!! They work great when you are just laying out or even working outside and want to get more of a tan or Don&#x27;t even use a tanning bed! Just one thing to keep in mind, they are NOT waterproof! So if you plan to swim, wait until you are going to be out of the water for a bit before applying!

    <li> this smells great, gives you a bit of color so you don&#x27;t come out of the bed looking &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; and adds to your tanning experience over all</li>
    <li> Its too strong. Makes me smell like burt skin. 50x I found to work better and faster as well. If u don&#x27;t put the 100x on perfectly and evenly; u will be paying for it! Looks horrible if not applied perfectly. I personally didn&#x27;t have time like that to spend in the tanning room. I reccommend the 50x because it works fast, smells great, and darkens your skin evenly; even if its quickly put on. 100x is way too strong. It was burning me not tanning me!</li>
    <li> I researched several kinds of lotion and this just seem to pop out at me.  I love that is has the silicon in it makes my legs and body smoother and a more elastic feel not dry.  Lots of mosture.  I bought 2 and I just love it.  I am a fairly pale person and have a hard time tanning in the sun.  As long as i wipe my hands immediately after when applying it, they are never orange.  the smell is ok.  The first 2 times i used this product i noticed a change in color right away.  it does not make me appear orange but tan.  I always have a hard time tanning my legs but after a few more visits noticed i had color.  this is fantastic tanning lotion and i would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love it leaves skin feeling great plus a very dark beautiful tan</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m as white as white can be and I actually got brown!!!!!  I am loving this.  I paid such a low price and this product works great!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best. Nuff said. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I am on my 3rd bottle of Solid Black from Amazon and I can&#x27;t believe how well this works for the price. For years I spent $50-60 on tanning lotion from the salon, and this is the exact same thing! The product is never expired, never tampered with, it arrives quick and brand new each time. Don&#x27;t listen to the girls at the salon who try to &amp;#34;warn me&amp;#34; that I am buying a product that is most likely expired or damaged, they just need commission off their $60 tanning lotion. This is the exact same stuff, and I wouldn&#x27;t tan without it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this lotion.  Has a pleasant smell and goes on easily and absorbs quickly. Brings out a darker color with minimal use.</li>
    <li> AMAZING bronzer-I will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. I always search and search before I decide which one to purchase. I am really glad I chose this one. It seems to really accelerate my tan, I let my friend use it and she went out and bought it the next day. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell, even going on it doesn&#x27;t smell that great, but that&#x27;s usually the case with tanning lotions. I would definetely reccommend this lotion to someone who tans easily and wants that extra boost. I got a really nice brown color from it.</li>
    <li> I tan regularly in a megabed and couldn&#x27;t break through my plateau until I used this lotion.  Was able to tell the difference immediately!  It leaves you a very slight orange tint to it but not Oompa Loompa orange, still natural looking.  Make sure you wash/wipe your hands, palms, and toes well after applying... I noticed that slight orangey-ness when I missed a spot between my fingers.  It applies well but make sure you apply evenly and thoroughly--especially on your feet/ankles.  The smell could definitely be better.  It smells so-so putting on... afterward you have a funky, DHA smell.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this lotion and I LOVE IT! I am a tanaholic so I have used pretty much every lotion in the book- tingles, bronzers, cooling, blush, you name it. With this, it gives me such a dark tan look. I am irish so its&#x27; so hard for me to get rid of the red on my skin, but with this, I look like I came back from Florida. Love this stuff and would recommend it with anyone who is pale skinned or hard to tan!!</li>
    <li> Seems to work well &amp; at a fraction of the cost from the tanning salons. Raymon Jacksonville, Florida.</li>
    <li> darkest tan ever!!!!! would purchase again. gives you the darkest tan I HAVE EVER HAD&lt;br /&gt;  Its nice to be dark in the winter time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  FAITH</li>
    <li> Like the lotion . It leaves skin feeling soft and smooth. Great value for the price give a rich dark tan.</li>
    <li> Great Item and seller!</li>
    <li> Not real lould but still has a good scent. Also I love the size of the bottle. Very worth it</li>
    <li> Not only does this stuff not work, it leaves streaks on my legs.  It stinks and I hate it in general.  I almost always force myself to use something up even if I don&#x27;t like it, but I can&#x27;t even finish this garbage.  I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Forget spending $60+ at tanning salon this stuff is the best! I get color almost after 1 tan. I love this lotion you must try</li>
    <li> Love it. My favorite lotion out of many I have tried.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth silky affect and it works really well. Lasts a long time too. Great bronzer. I am going to tan now.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews. I have wanted to buy a good lotion but the tanning places charge as much as $100 a bottle for different lotions. I have used it twice now and am amazed at the tan I already have. Do be careful because if you do not wash your hands well after applying you will have stained hands. And make sure you apply it really well to keep from having streaks. But I would still buy this again and again. I love it and recommend it. I don&#x27;t normally write reviews because you do not always believe what you read. But this is a great product and worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Worked very good on my super pale skin and smells very nice.</li>
    <li> Awesome had a nice even glowing tan</li>
    <li> Used this once and now im ORANGE!! DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Great product, just make sure to wash hands (nails) afterwards.</li>
    <li> This left my skin spotted &amp; orange. I made sure I was covered evenly before tanning but left looking like an oompa loompa :( the bronzer was a bit too strong</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well.No orange color and immediate tan even on really fair skin.Smells great too...</li>
    <li> i love to get on the sun with this tanning lotion, it does the job and i don&#x27;t have to be suntanning for a very long time</li>
    <li> have not used yet but excited about it came looking fresh and brand new.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells decent and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily. More like a high end lotion. Great for men and women.</li>
    <li> Works amazing and it smells so nice !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this tanning lotion. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> You do need to wash off your hands or it will make them orange .But other wise its a good price.</li>
    <li> The product works, no doubt about that. I cant stand the smell of it, and it stays on me for days. I wont buy this again</li>
    <li> As cost goes, this is the best tanning lotion I have found. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s also not as bad as most. However, I find most lotions that smell good are about double the price.</li>
    <li> Always get a good tan with this product and it smells really good, even after you are done tanning. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> works pretty good.must rub in all the way or may leave some color lines.though not very noticable and last awhile.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells terrible ...used once and never will used again. When you heats up under the lights starts to smell</li>
    <li> I love this tanner, bronzes quickly and I&#x27;m fairly white.  Love the smell and the price is unbeatable.  Have purchased this twice and will purchase again when bottle is empty. Don&#x27;t pay salon prices get this!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I will definitely buy it again. I love the way it makes my skin feel. It doesn&#x27;t have any nasty smell. It gives you an amazing tan.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion I get a really nice dark tan from it. there for I don&#x27;t have to tan as often as I had to with my old lotion I would recommend this lotion to my friends</li>
    <li> I have tried many high dollar tanning lotions, but this one is by far the best for the price.  After just a few uses I could tell a huge difference.  A little also goes a long way because it spreads so easy.  Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> Great color and goes on smooth. Thumbs way up!</li>
    <li> I am pale. When I am in the sun for a few hours I turn red. With this product, I actually tan! A few minutes in the tanning bed with this lotion on, and I see a difference. No more red! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This lotion is horrible. I&#x27;ve gotten more tan using nothing. It doesn&#x27;t work whatsoever. I will not purchase from this seller again. Walmart lotion works 100% better.</li>
    <li> I love it !  works great smells good</li>
    <li> Great, I receive it  today and went straigh to the tanning center and first time and I got great color, highly recommended</li>
    <li> A++++++++++++++ Item is just as described. Works great</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and helps get a golden tan better than some of the more expensive brands.  We have made multiply purchases of this brand and will continue.  I like to swap out lotions from time to time but solid black always delivers a good tan.  There is the typical after smell but it&#x27;s common and not as bad as others</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical ordering this lotion bc it is one of the cheaper lotions on amazon &amp; I was afraid it would turn me orange. But this lotion doesn&#x27;t turn me orange! Every time I use this lotion I come out of the tanning bed darker &amp; after a few hours I am even more darker! I LOVE IT!!!! I haven&#x27;t noticed any streaking either but I take wipes with me and wipe my hands &amp; in between my fingers off before I get in the bed. Also this lotion smells sooo good!! &amp; it still smells good after tanning no ATO!</li>
    <li> Nice smell for a tanning lotion. Not strong or annoying. The last one I bought besides the Paint it Black 50x was Ed Hardy and it literally made me nauseous after applying. it was like bathing in men&#x27;s cologne. I HAD to shower afterwards and re apply an unscented lotion. I feel tanning lotions should be pleasant to use! Lol. None of my regular face or body lotions are scented because I find most fragrances offensive &amp; they cause me to get headache. I am a highly sensitive person. This lotion did auto-darken a bit, but not more than the 50x IMO. I didn&#x27;t get any serious bronzing.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever had! Absolutely amazing you get so dark it is awesome. You get a solid dark color, not orange. Love this product so much.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and it arrived quickly. It did get me tan but if i skipped a day or two tanning and not using the product my tan would fade away. It does moisturize wonderfully but does turn your hands orange. It also makes you have that after tan burnt smell...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really notice that I am significantly darker after 10-15 minutes in a bronzing bed or a regular bed</li>
    <li> Bought this for my bf. he likes the color but the bronzers stay on your hand and turn orange if you don&#x27;t wash them immediately. He had the space between his fingers turn orange for a few days</li>
    <li> The lotion is amazing. I only tan 2 times a week in a level two bed and I got darker with it than before I used it. And you CAN use it on your face. Make sure you rub it in or your hands will turn a bit orange.</li>
    <li> My skin type tans, but not as well as some people in my group of friends. I use this product as more of a bronzer than a tanning lotion because it gives me that tropical looking tan while spending less time in the sun. It smells great but can stain some surfaces so be careful with your application. Oh and buy this here on Amazon at a quarter of the cost at a local retailer (tanning salon.)</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product. WAAAAY Cheaper then the lotions at the tanning salon and works just as good. I will continue to use this lotion Even though they have recently upped their prices.</li>
    <li> Works amazing. I could definitely see results after using one time. Best lotion yet.</li>
    <li> it does stink though.</li>
    <li> I bought this tanning lotion from Amazon because the tanning salons charge a fortune for the same thing. It works great. I am not crazy about the smell, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad but I think they could have worked on making it smell a bit more pleasant.</li>
    <li> It is performing fine.It seems to smell better after the tanning session. I gave it three stars as I&#x27;ve not used any comparable products as of yet.</li>
    <li> Love product ...took 7days past due day. But still favorite lotion so its okay</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion i have ever bought. i got really brown really fast and it smells great, i have bought multiple bottles</li>
    <li> great item makes you dark tan ,,love it</li>
    <li> I have a very fair complexion and burn (then peel) very easily. This product is wonderful. I have not burned yet and I have a very even and deep tan (for me).</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion once when I first started tanning a few years ago thinking itd work wonders because of the 100x but I was wrong. This lotion smells horrible plus it leaves you with an awful bad ato. The lotion was thick which a little doesn&#x27;t go a long way and it made me orange not tan. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this garbage you&#x27;ll look like a oompa loompa that smells like burnt something.</li>
    <li> This lotion is my new favorite.  Usually I use only designer skin tanning products, but this blows them away.  Shipping was fast.  The smell is great as well.</li>
    <li> The tan lasts longer with this lotion!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Works great for the price and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
    <li> This lotion got me so tan after my second time using it. I love it. I did not notice streaking yet but I have only used it twice. Worth it!</li>
    <li> Good lotion but not good on the bronzing effect.</li>
    <li> I havent used it enough to see how well it works.</li>
    <li> Works well! People should understand that tans are &amp; should be gradual. You won&#x27;t go all the way to dark the 1st time but you will get darker. I use a cheaper lotion until I get a good base tan then start using this &amp; I get a great brown even tan. Its not too thick &amp; has a good smell!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. My second bottle. Rub in really well or it will streak. Wash hands immediately after applying.</li>
    <li> Loved the lotion! I could tell I was darker after just once use! Great bronzer! I will definitely purchase this lotion again!</li>
    <li> Great product, and fast shipping.  No streaking and good scent; however, wash or at least wipe hands after application.</li>
    <li> works great, really enhances the tanning color. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Has a good smell not like some that leave you smelling like burnt skin. Noticed color change first time I used it but then again I was in the best bed the salon had. My favorite tanning lotion so far and especially for the price it&#x27;s ,legitimate.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion. It may be the bed I currently use to tan in or the frequency. I am not getting the tan I expected when I purchased this lotion. I am aiming for a deeper, stronger bronze finish.</li>
    <li> Great product and usually 100.00 a bottle. Cheaper on here...</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, this is the 2nd time I have purchased it, so much cheaper than the salon pricing and well worth it!  I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned and my skin seems to be stubborn to tan and will lose the tan pretty fast. I decided to give this a try being as it was fairly cheap and had good reviews. I was however a little curious as to why it was so cheap, I didnt know what to expect for myself. I got my package pretty quick which is a major plus!! I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out, being that I was out of lotion at the time and waiting on this. I went straight to the tanning salon &amp; lathered up :) To much of my surprise, this went on nice and smooth, it had a nice smell to it and it felt like a very lush moisturizing lotion on my skin. When I got out I was stunned! This lotion had given me such a lovely tan! It got me tanner than all of the other $70+ tanning lotions I had tried previously. I got so many compliments and everyone asked if I had just came back from a vacation in sunny paradise ;) I would recommend this to anyone! Especially if you are looking to break through your tanning thresh-hold and get a deeper color on a budget. This is now one of my favorite lotions, Im so glad I took a gamble and ordered this lotion!! It was totally worth it &amp; then some!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product when I saw the low price, but after using it during four different tanning sessions, I am very impressed by how much darker my skin looks.  The lotion doesn&#x27;t give you any lines or patchy spots from not rubbing it in all the way, and it smells good. I would recommend this lotion to people who don&#x27;t religiously tan and don&#x27;t want to spend that much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product !</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I don&#x27;t tan too often because I&#x27;m pretty busy, but, when I can, I use the tanning beds at my gym. But BECAUSE I don&#x27;t tan that often is the reason I love this lotion! After one 10 minute session It looks like I&#x27;ve done about 3 tanning sessions. There is bronzer in this lotion, so I just apply and then wipe my hands and between my fingers really well with a towel. This lotion rocks. I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Heard of skin cancer? Duh!</li>
    <li> Delivered in 2 days ! Was cheap smells great and works really well! Very very happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> This sells for $70.00 in a tanning salon here in my town, I got it on here for $15.00!!!!!!!!!!!! So amazing, thank you</li>
    <li> I used this whole bottle. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin sticky or oily which is great.  However, I didn&#x27;t notice a drastic increase in my tan from using or not using the product.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST lotion I have EVER used! Tanned twice for 15 minuets and I was at least 4 shades darker!! I&#x27;m so happy with it! I did notice dry skin after a week of not tanning. I had millions of little flakes all over the inside of my clothes. So stay lotionized!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. first time I used in my tanning bed I was so brown.LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and it works well.  Tanning lotion expensive when buy at salon so can get better quality such as this at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I recently started tanning for my first time ever and was looking for an inexpensive tanning lotion that does the job. I tried this one out and love it! After one use, I could tell the difference. Also the tan lasts! I will continue to use this product and recommend to others. TRY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion, it gives me a great color, I recommend it to anyone, especially just to switch up lotions or if your skin is wanting some red to pop the bronze color, P.S. Don&#x27;t wear white and then sweat all over or workout in white after tanning with this, the lotion is brown, this stuff leaves a creamed coffee color stain, worth it though, toss this in the mix of skin creams to thicken up and tighten your skin, it also helps combined with after tan lotion!-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for tanning indoors and out. Its not sticky as other lotions out there. I highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking for fast quality tanning.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell, smells kind of like cocunut with pineapple. I finally found a tanning lotion I like,  I would highly reccommend this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, I put it in my hand then rub it on, I haven&#x27;t had any issues. The scent is even good enough I can go back to work and not smell like someone who sprayed on way too much cheap perfume. Not Too Dark For A White Girl.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m darker than I&#x27;ve ever been but my hands are orange / streaky in one area. Good lotion over all</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this is not the same stuff I previously purchased from my tanning salon.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! It really gives you instant color. My only recommendation is to wash hands well because it will stain between your fingers if you&#x27;re not careful. However, the bronzing power of this lotion is amazing.</li>
    <li> I am not a beginning tanner, but not an advanced tanner either. Right in the middle I&#x27;d say. I read the all the favorable reviews on this lotion before buying and I was really excited to receive it and start using it. After using it for over a week, here are my observations. It smells good going on, but I noticed the after tan odor right away after tanning, and it lasted all day. I didn&#x27;t feel that it made me tan any darker than any other product out there. I am usually a lotion snob and stick with Australian Gold&#x27;s high end products such as Crystal or Vogue. This lotion definatley didn&#x27;t stack up to either of those products. For the cost difference, this lotion served it&#x27;s purpose, but I guess the old saying is true, you get what you pay for. Not even in the same class as your high end tanning lotions. Bottom line, I didn&#x27;t hate it, but I didn&#x27;t think it really had any super darkening benefit either.</li>
    <li> This lotion creates the look of a tan after the first application.  However, you must be very careful in the application or it will streak in places and stain your hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for 15 years (indoor and outdoor) and have used numerous lotions. This is the only one I&#x27;ve ever regretted purchasing! I read all the reviews and decided since it was inexpensive I&#x27;d take the risk and try it for myself. BIG MISTAKE!! I&#x27;ve had all the same problems others mentioned. My skin smells burned (especially my hands) and I have a lot of dark spots and streaks. I was very cautious when applying the product each time I used it to avoid \\&quot;staining\\&quot; in certain areas. Apparently that doesn&#x27;t matter. It does provide excellent color, but it&#x27;s not worth it to walk around smelling bad and looking like I have a skin condition.</li>
    <li> We have a tanning bed and somebody suggested using this product so we gave it a try.  We really like the lotion and it is half the cost of some of the other lotions.  We will use this again and I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years!  It&#x27;s The Best on the market, and I&#x27;ve tried Many others products.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! I am fair skinned and after one use it made me so much darker. I would recommend it to anyone who tans frequently!</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR AWHILE NOW AND I GET GREAT RESULTS.GREAT PRICE VALUE AND GREAT OVER ALL PRODUCT...I RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT...YOU WANT BE DISAPPOINTED....</li>
    <li> Bronzer stained on my skin and it smells like fake tanning lotion that you would buy at target,  Has that same kind if smell, I returned it.</li>
    <li> i was in the direct sun for five hours and didn&#x27;t see any improvement or degree in my tan, not for my type of skin. won&#x27;t buy again. captez</li>
    <li> Good color not orange. Just doesn&#x27;t go very dark.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t possibly find a better lotion gets you as tan as possible , smells fine no after odor that people notice and say eww</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful!  Timely delivery! The price is unbeatable! The service, OUTSTANDING! I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchase that why I took a shot BUT If ur trying to avoid a streaky bronzing agent don&#x27;t buy this.. Use this twice and I have super bad streaks on my knees and ankles.. Disappointed</li>
    <li> Im pretty sure this product is watered down. There is definitely no bronzer in it.</li>
    <li> This is a good deal, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. There is definitely better tanning lotion out there. This lotion is just okay.</li>
    <li> Eh , its alright. I sort of believe its a knock off brand. But it did work and give you some color. Before I started using this I was already pretty drak . I didn&#x27;t really notice a change in my color. But I do like how it rubs on quick and the smell is pretty good also. I never got any streaks like other people said . Id refer this to people who aren&#x27;t that dark but aren&#x27;t pale either.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best. I recommend this to anyone wanting a healthy tan. I even recommend applying it, letting dry and applying more so you can come out shades darker.&lt;br /&gt;i use it on my face and it gives me a nice glow. No orange and no mess. It smells good and works wonderful!</li>
    <li> The color is nice it doesn&#x27;t fade especially if you wait until the next morning to shower. It smears a bit though you have to be very careful to rub it in evenly to avoid streaks.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything special. I didn&#x27;t get any darker than I usually would.</li>
    <li> This is my go to lotion that I have been using for years to accelerate my tanning regime. It gets me tan fast! Must warn you IF YOU DO NOT TAKE THE TIME BEFORE HAND TO RUB IT IN WELL YOU WILL GET STREAKS IN YOUR TAN SO RUB RUB RUB!!! this goes for your hands too!!  I always tan quicker, richer and darker with this lotion and for HALF THE PRICE!! of other lotions you cant beat it!! LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Seriously the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I got darker in 2 tanning sessions than I had in weeks of tanning with my last lotion. It&#x27;s also great for the beach! I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I thought this was tingle....but otherwise good product, just not for me.</li>
    <li> Same product as the tanning salon, except at a great price. The lotion was thick and smelled great. I even took it with me to the beach and got awesome and even tanning results.</li>
    <li> This product is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold. It glides on beautifully and the silcone in it is like silk on your skin. The slight bronzer in it is perfect to establish the most beautiful tan ever. I would recommend this to any skin type out there!</li>
    <li> not sure what others are doing that they dont like it cause i love this stuff been tanning only 3 days with this and i am already getting dark its a must have if you wanna get dark fast i will keep buying this as long as its out there</li>
    <li> This lotion smells really nice and is not greasy, I liked it when I first began tanning as I was quite fair and this has just enough bronzer that it&#x27;s not too drastic. Does not streak, just be mindful of your hands and feet areas where product build up may occur.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and this lotion is great! It definitely browns you (no orange tint!) woohoo! Living in the PacNW, we don&#x27;t see much sun in the winter and I hate being pasty pale so I was very happy to find this lotion.  I also use the Designer Black tan extender (I&#x27;ll review that on its own page) and my tan holds very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I noticed staining between my fingers so be sure to wipe your hands before you get in the bed!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It gives you great color after only a few uses. The only thing I do not like is the way you smell after you get out of the tanning bed. It&#x27;s pretty funky. Otherwise, four stars.</li>
    <li> Product smells great before tanning and after tanning. I have had a great experience with the product since I bought it. I&#x27;m excited to go tanning now to know that I will smell good and get a nice golden brown color. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Im pretty pale and burn VERY easily. The first few times I used it I got a GREAT golden brown tan, but then I was too buzy to keep it up, and my tan started coming off in patches, so until I went back to the tanning bed a few more times, I looked like a bronze and white leopard. It was pretty horrible. (I do have very sencitive skin and bad allergies, so that could have been part of the problem). I kept using it to use up the bottle, and it seems ok, but Im going to give something else a shot now. Some of my friends have used this lotion too, and they didnt have any problems, and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on other reviews i read and they were absolutely roght about it...it is the only product that takes your tanning to a darker level.  Even for people like me who have light skin and a hard time tanning, this product is AMAZING!!!  Make sure you wipe your hands off after applying though and rub in well so it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about a year now and I swear by it. I have a nice base to where I only go about 3 times a week if that now. It doesn&#x27;t smell the best but it does the job so I&#x27;m not too worried about that. It leaves a great color that is long lasting but it will crease or streak if you are not careful. Overall for the price it is a great value!</li>
    <li> THIS IS DEFINITELY A DARK BRONZER HOWEVER CAN REALLY \\&quot;BUILD UP\\&quot; AND STREAK IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL!! SMELLS NICE BUT FOR SURE NOT A GREAT LOTION!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I did not get much color from this lotion and I also did not enjoy the scent of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the lotion a few times and it&#x27;s not the best but it does give you results quick. The bronzer is a little streaky so make sure you rub it in well. I haven&#x27;t tanned in 4 days and I still look really dark. The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Being fair skinned, it&#x27;s trial and error for me to find something to build on a base tan and give me a darker, lasting look. This is one that gets me a nice bronzed look and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad tingle to it. I used twice or three times a week at the start and then scaled back to once or twice per week. The smell wasn&#x27;t great, but I could put up with it because of the benefits.</li>
    <li> Awesome tanning lotion</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my daughter.  She states that it made dried out her skin.  Scent of the lotion is not bad.</li>
    <li> correct consistency. Smells great. Speeds up tanning.</li>
    <li> Smells good.  Seems to help with tanning.  I get dark pretty easily anyways, but this seems to keep my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> favorite bronzer works well no tingle but works as it should</li>
    <li> shipping and product is great</li>
    <li> This lotion left me with a lovely golden color and had a nice smell to it. No streaks at all, (although I admit that I am a pro), and I was happy with the color I got even after one application.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this lotion! I&#x27;ve only used it twice now, but major difference already. I&#x27;m at least a shade and a half darker than before and I&#x27;ve been tanning several times a week since March. The smell is different, it smells like just normal lotion to me not fruity or whatever like most tanning lotions, but I didn&#x27;t notice or get the weird burnt smell some of the reviews talked about. I&#x27;m amazed with this stuff! My tanning salon sells it for $55 I was able to get it for $20 after shipping, but I can see why its worth that much honestly. Try it, you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I always get the darkest most even tan from this product. I have tried many others but this is the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time tanner. Smells great. I can tell its moisturizing.But I can&#x27;t tell if its actually making me darker.</li>
    <li> I used to be one of those people that tanned every day in college and have used my fair share of beds, lotions ($-$$$), tan extenders, etc. so I was definitely a little wary of buying a bottle of lotion off Amazon for only a few bucks. Now that I&#x27;m a little older and have had a chance to heal after having my daughter I thought it would be great to get back into tanning (just a few times a month for &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34;). I haven&#x27;t tanned in a couple of years so you can imagine how fair/pale skinned I am lol. I used this lotion once yesterday (basic bed; 10 minutes) and can definitely see a difference! The lotion looks, feels, and smells just like high-end designer tanning lotion and I can&#x27;t believe I actually picked up a pretty decent amount of color. I was really worried about turning orange because of some of the reviews but I&#x27;m not orange at all! It&#x27;s only been once but I plan on going a few more times this week so I will update my review after a month or so to really get the full effect of the lotion. My suggestion- it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, and makes you brown - not orange.  I highly recommend it and think it&#x27;s an excellent addition for any tanning experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this tanning lotion because I already had a good base tan. I wanted a lotion that would help me get darker, so I went with this one. After using it for a few days I realized it turned my arms, legs, and face orange. I wanted a lotion that would help me brown more then I am, not turn me orange. I would not recomend this lotion for anyone, even someone with a good dark base tan like I had. It will just turn you orange.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews about a product, but I wanted to make sure I did leave a review about this product. I was skeptical before trying it, but I needed to let other people know what a great product this is! I had been using JWOWW lotion before and there was not anything wrong with that lotion - it is also my favorite. However, it was a little pricey this time around so I decided to try and order something a little more affordable. I read the reviews and while most of them say the same great things, I figured I had nothing to lose by trying it. I am very glad I did. I have only used it for a short time and I can see the results. I look brown and golden and it&#x27;s helping me get through that pale stage, before I can get back to my great base tan again. It does stain your hands, but it isn&#x27;t noticeable on my hands and it&#x27;s not too bad. I also DO NOT wash my hands after use, the way that it tells you too. So I am sure if I did wash my hands, I wouldn&#x27;t have that problem. But, again, it&#x27;s not bothersome to me. I smell like I have just gotten a Mystic Tan, but to me that says, \\&quot;COLOR!!\\&quot; It also reminds me to not shower right away, which I can forget easily and wash it all away. It&#x27;s a fantastic product and for the price, you cannot beat it!</li>
    <li> Hey this is a great product and it smells good.  Worth the purchase. It&#x27;s much cheaper than the local stoes.</li>
    <li> Love, Love this lotion.  Have been using for years.</li>
    <li> Has a funky smell to it. Other than that, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for a month now and I&#x27;m darkest I have ever been.</li>
    <li> There are better tanning lotions out there, but the price more than makes up for whatever shortcomings this lotion has in comparison. I still get good tanning results using it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ever buy lotion at the salon, this stuff is great, lots of bronzer and great color. Make sure to wash hands after application due to the bronzer.</li>
    <li> Smells good, works great!  Love it!</li>
    <li> LOVED IT~GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I like it and it works great but man are you stinky afterward.  The color that it gives you is amazing.</li>
    <li> Gave me great color and didn&#x27;t smell horrible. I would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> WOW! I wanted to get a tan quick before vacation, and this did it! I do not feel it has any hint of the orange look some experience. I loved the smell as well! Totally worth it, and i didnt regret spending 5x the amount at the salon!</li>
    <li> product was what was described , lotion works great and cant beat the price. I would recommend this product to any one who</li>
    <li> creamy lotion that gives great color. I have red hair and freckles so tanning is always an effort for me. This lotion gives a great color. Very pleased!!!!</li>
    <li> I started out years ago using their jet blaque tanning lotion and loved it. While I am fair skinned it gave me amazing color. Then my tanning salon closed and forced me to go somewhere else and they didn&#x27;t offer this tanning lotion brand which made me start looking around. I happen to find it here on amazon, but decided to go with solid black which I love! So glad I went with this! No more embarrassing white legs and face! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you rub it in a circle motion and if u do happen to get streaks it will fade away and blend in the next time u tan. Also I always just grab a towel and wipe off extra lotion that gets in between fingers. Problem solved :)</li>
    <li> I look Jamaican after using this product about half a dozen times. This item is pretty good and i recommend this product to others to purchase</li>
    <li> Great works good.. A+ A+ A+ A A A a aa a a a a a aa aaaa  aaa  aG</li>
    <li> this lotion is pretty good for the price, but doesn&#x27;t smell that great. Will turn hands orange if you don&#x27;;t wash them as soon as you apply the lotion.. Okay product but nothing great.</li>
    <li> I loved it and it was just what it said in the picture!! Just what I wanted!! Thanks very much!</li>
    <li> This really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used before getting in a tan capsule and my tan was great for my wedding day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definetly recommend this. It works fast.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice, there isn&#x27;t much to say, the bottle its pretty solid and it arrived quite fast, also the skin really tans nicely with it!</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful, the best I ever bought, I been tanning along time now, this is the best lotion I ever bought, there&lt;br /&gt;is no after smell, I got it the other day went tanning, and let me tell you, you do get dark from this, if I could I would rate this a 10</li>
    <li> This lotion arrived faster than expected and works great! It has a slight tint of bronzer in the lotion and it definitely has a good moisturizer in it as well. Very affordable especially compared to what the tanning beds charge.</li>
    <li> very good product an got me tan fast an dak im fair skin so I burn first but after the first day burn I could tell I was getting darker an after I quit tanning for a little while  I  had people tell me I was still dark.</li>
    <li> First...these people that say it turns you orange are effin stupid. It dont even come out the bottle orange enough to stain you or turn you a different color. Im mad ive used it and it hasnt gotten me a single shade darker.</li>
    <li> At first I loved this lotion.  I was getting so dark so fast.  Then, I realized I was starting to turn orange and anywhere it wasn&#x27;t even it was so streaky. I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> Doesnt burn or create the on fire sensation but leaves a great tan....not orange. You do have to be cautious about touching other people until after you shower because they may break out in a rash</li>
    <li> I decided to try this out from reading the reviews and few people said it works and i thought why not give it a try? i got this yesturday and used it only once and at first i thought wow okay it really does not work but over time the color starts showing and it DOES NOT smell like burning tanning lotion. it leaves you skin smooth and it does smell good(: hopefully once i use it again it gives me some darkness ! (: give it a try and see if this ones for you(:</li>
    <li> I was excited to use it because of all the reviews. I bought it and used it acouple of times but had to give it up because no matter how much I try to rub it in it would leave streaks on my legs. Also it turned my stomach an ugly \\&quot;organgey\\&quot; color. Did not work at all for me.</li>
    <li> Solid Black is very, very good - the only reason I couldn&#x27;t give it five stars was because it still lacks the truly profound bronzing necessary to see results after only a few sessions, however for the price I would argue it is unbeatable. If you don&#x27;t want to spend the big bucks on the fancier products with tingle factors and all that other garbage, this is absolutely your best bet. Been through multiple bottles now, and the one thing I wanted to include in my review is THAT I WAS ABLE TO SEE AN OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS 100X BRONZER AND THE LESSER (around 60X) BRONZERS, so I was very pleased overall with these purchases over the last few months).</li>
    <li> I was sent the WRONG tanning lotion!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the one that I should have received. It is moisturizing, smells great, and gives you some instant color that is not streaky or orange as long as you rub in well and wash/baby wipe your hands after application.&lt;br /&gt;The one that I did receive is called Black Storm 60x. It is an okay lotion. BUT i am VERY disappointed and thought other buyers should know there is a possibility you will get sent the wrong item. I hate to write such a negative review on a product I actually like.</li>
    <li> I got so dark with only 5 tans total on a level 2 and 3 bed! I get dark fast to begin with but I got dark a lot faster then normal with this awesome lotion!</li>
    <li> The best tanning lotion that I have used.  I am extra dark but, just make sure the lotion isn&#x27;t streaked when you apply it.</li>
    <li> Great Product works really good</li>
    <li> Product came as said on time!! I&#x27;m very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> Love It!! Does its Job Good Price</li>
    <li> Works great! GREAT PRICE!!!</li>
    <li> Wear gloves. It will stain your hands for a week. Works good, cheap. Doesn&#x27;t smell foofy either.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have a hard time finding good tanning lotion because I&#x27;m an advanced tanner and go through many plateaus and this helped me out of them.. plus i received it very fast. Great buy!</li>
    <li> i ordered 3 spark plugs, n 3 sparkplug wires i got 2 spark plugs n 1 wire</li>
    <li> Recieved this lotion yest, tried it this morning and its awesome! The color that I have now this evening is amazing. Def in love w it! You wont b disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was expecting better results from a 100x lotion. My JWOWW got me darker in 2 sessions. Plus this lotion made me break out very badly. I kind if have sensitive skin tho. I went back to my JWOWW and Bombshell tingle</li>
    <li> I have gotten sooooo dark...It is amazing. I don&#x27;t stay long in the tanning bed and I have gotten sooooo dark</li>
    <li> Used it the first time and it left dark streaks.  Haven&#x27;t used it again, but will so I don&#x27;t waste it</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, simply because results depend on the person and it was being ordered online. However I just used it for the first time today for 8 minutes in a Diva bed and it added noticeable color to my skin! Will definitly order again when I run out!</li>
    <li> smells like clean leather :p (if that makes sense) but it as unsealed. I do not know how long it had ben sitting, (because ALL tanning lotions mainly the DHA ones have a very short shelf life, and then will mark down the price) BUt I love it, I cant wait to try it, thank youbuyer, shipped quick.</li>
    <li> Love It Leaves My Skin Perfect  Best Bronzer So Far Left My Skin An  Amazing Color With Quick Results  &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> love this stuff! use it all the time...im not a fan of the smell but love the color it gives me</li>
    <li> very good and bronzed awesome</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. The color looks natural and gives a nice golden brown tan. Just be sure to wash your hands after applying.</li>
    <li> great color when i used this lotion.  did not have a tingle.  i used this both on the beach and in the bed.  very happy!</li>
    <li> Excellent results with this product.  I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Great! I tanned for 2 weeks preparing for a fun Labor Day girls weekend getaway trip and I was very happy with the tanning results. I got dark very fast! It didn&#x27;t turn me orange, and it smells good!</li>
    <li> I love this bronzer.  Best I&#x27;ve found in my quest to keep a year-round tan in NYC.  Also a wonderful price.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>
    <li> Its a good basic tanning lotion &amp; reasonable. It took more time to get a base tan compared to the expensive lotions I have used before. I usually tan in a medium level bed. If you are trying to get a good tan in a month I would purchase a different lotion.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter thought price outstanding.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion it works really good i can tell a difference for sure. And smell so good</li>
    <li> Great bronzing results in which people do comment on the same day as used.  I tan about once a week and this holds up the tan for that duration.  Make sure you apply it evenly or you can have blotchy areas.  It smells like tanning lotion - nothing spectacular nor overpowering.  I like this better than Queen which I used but did not see as much of a result.  I will use this brand for awhile.</li>
    <li> This product came exactly as described and I received it very quickly. I love this lotion. It smells great and works wonders. I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is a great filler product for tanning. I use Dark Sexy Legs when I really want to look dark but it is expensive so I use this product between tans to keep my color rich. This product tends to be more red based where my other is more golden so it creates a full bronze tan by my alternating. Also it is a great price for the quality of product, but be careful in your application it can streak if you are not careful. The smell is fine not offensive but I tend to have a baked smell after tanning.</li>
    <li> I Tan easy..and thought this would give me more of a dark tan..but it has not..read the revues and they said make sure u wash hands after applying..i wiped my hands with a towel.but no staining..i have used bronzers before and unless u wash ur hands good with soap and water..u will get the rusty stain between ur fingers..it&#x27;s almost like there&#x27;s no bronzer in there..Hmmmmmmmmm..just saying</li>
    <li> So I just got mine in the mail today and I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, so I can&#x27;t rate that part but when I opened the box, the cap had been broken into 4 different pieces. Luckily it comes with a smaller cap already on it, so it&#x27;s not completely ruined, but jeez! They need to figure out a new packaging system...I didn&#x27;t pay to get one with a broken cap!</li>
    <li> I gave Solid Black three stars because it is a great tanning lotion, but it is more for trying to get a base tan.&lt;br /&gt;There was just to much bronzer in it for me. I like a tanning lotion with just a little bronzer and some sizzle that is going to make you a shade darker when you come out of the tanning bed. Don&#x27;t get me wrong this lotion does that, but I think it would work best for the people starting out tanning who are just trying to build there color. I have a really good tan and have been tanning for a long time. I like to tan everyday, but try and just go every other day. But for anyone who wants to get dark fast and is just starting out this is the way to go!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning lotion I really love it, you will spend half the time in a tanning bed using this. Makes you tan faster.</li>
    <li> I am pale and I&#x27;ve spent booko bucks on expensive lotions.  My buck has stopped here.  This is an AMAZING lotion.  I did not turn orange, but a nice, believable brown and it helped me tan evenly and nice.  I use it on my &#x27;off&#x27; tanning days as a bronzer and everyone comments on how &#x27;healthy&#x27; I look!  It smells great, turns my pale skin a great shade and bronzes me on my off days.  This is the perfect product, and for a fraction of what you&#x27;d pay in a salon or on some of the other products from other brands.  Look no further!  Also, quick shipping!!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a nice natural bronze color, but it did leave a lot of streaks making me look like I had a bad spray tan for that reason I do not recommend this lotion. The Smell is nothing fancy, it went on smooth. You can find much better cheap lotions then this one, I like the [[ASIN:B00147FGJ8 Millenium Tanning New Paint It Black Auto-darkening Dark Tanning Lotion, 50X, 13.5 Ounce]] better than this, probably because it has less streaky bronzer in it.</li>
    <li> The lotion has a nice smell and works well! But it isn&#x27;t a tingle lotion at all and not sure y it comes up with those specific lotions. I wasn&#x27;t wanting that and I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> 100x bronzer. This stuff is amazing. You can tan twice a week and havea great tan. Doesn&#x27;t turn you into a carrot. You can use of your face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t listen ton the trolls who work at your tanning salon about you should buy lotion online.  look at the reviews on amazon. nuff said</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. The first time I laid I had a nice dark tan. I had been using a natural bronzes I bought at the salon and my chest keep burning. After using this lotion... I haven&#x27;t burnt at all. I have a nice dark tan which has been very hard to achieve over the years and I always gave up tanning. Now a great price and great product. Recommend to everyone. Just make sure you wash your hands.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well for a darkening lotion. I dont really feel that the tan lasts all that long. Goes on well, be sure to wash your hands afterwards or else it will stain them. Smells nice, until after you tan and you get the burnt tanning lotion smell that doesn&#x27;t go away until you shower twice. Decent amount for the price, but unfortunately I wouldnt buy it again.</li>
    <li> Solid Black began working the moment I walked out into the sunshine. By the end of the day those areas of my body exposed to the sun had begun to take on a bronze glow.  My exposure to the sunlight that first day was little more than 30 minutes as I meandered from being in the shade to sunlight cutting grass.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. It does not get you help you tan at all. I have a good base tan and since it says 100 x, I just knew it would increast my tan.. Not the case. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this tanning lotion for two years.  It gives me a dark tan quickly. I have got many compliments on my tan which is dark.  I have used this product in tanning bed and while in the sun. I have found this product to be Great!!!!! LOVE. LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> All in all I liked this product, it goes on smooth and smells nice.  Then on the third application i noticed I was orangey looking.  Now this may not happen for everyone, but if you are naturally darker beware.  If this is an issue for you on tanners, makeup etc (it all turns orange on me) then you&#x27;ll know who you are, otherwise I&#x27;d recommend giving it a shot  - it&#x27;s much less here than in the salon!</li>
    <li> it just wasn&#x27;t for me , i am a fair skinned person so it made me stained looked. As for someone else they may like it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this friday and it came in yesterday..i tan farely easily so i went to tan yesterday for 18 min and now i&#x27;m not joking at least 4 shades darker! This tanning lotion is amazing im soooo glad i got this:)</li>
    <li> Great Product!  arrived before stated it would!  This product works just like it states.  It was a great buy at a great price!</li>
    <li> From the 1st time I used it I LOVED this lotion. I like to alternate with another lotion but it really gets you DARK!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this a few different times and it does absolUtely nothing for my color. Tried leaving it on longer before and after to no avail.</li>
    <li> Product arrived day earlier than expected.. &amp; packages very well. I would buy from this seller again..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the tanning lotion works, I&#x27;ve had it for about two weeks now. I&#x27;m a very experienced tanner and I go in the high pressure uv/a &amp; uv/b beds..(level 6 or as some might know a magic or instant bed) and I tan extremely easy normally. Regularly I could not use any lotion and get in the bed and come out a shade or two darker, I now have a pretty bronze dark tan and wanted this for the 100x bronzers. I have put it on and see no difference from any other lotion. Yes I still get darker with every visit but not the results you&#x27;d think with a 100x bronzer. It may be bc my tan is already so dark that it&#x27;s not effective but in sure for lighter skinned people this would be a great purchase to get you color quick if you&#x27;re just starting your tanning season.&lt;br /&gt;Again the seller was great and the product I wanted to like more than I did but I would still recommend for someone not as experienced as myself</li>
    <li> Never will i EVER spend top dollar on expensive lotions again! I&#x27;ve used hundred dollar lotions that had worse results than this stuff. This lotion works, and leaves my skin silky soft every time :) Great amount of silicones! Strong bronzers that won&#x27;t leave you orange which i love! although I do advise you to have a base tan before using this product because it could streak you. Smells great with tolerable after tan odor. I like to alternate this one with the &#x27;Insanely Black&#x27; also by &#x27;Millenium&#x27; (which IS a tingle!) for the darkest tan. Very Pleased with my purchase. Will I buy it again? YES! :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product and a great value why pay retail when you can wholesale. An absolute must for tanners, smooth and creamy product.</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing and has totally made me dark. Never had any problem with spotting and I don&#x27;t take the extra time to make sure its rubbed in. Would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion very much and will be re-ordering it. It makes you nice and dark after a few times of using it.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this tanning bed lotion and I am still really impressed with the results! I had been spending around $65 a bottle for tanning lotion, but was recommended this product by a friend and it works just as well (if not better) than the one I was using before that cost SO much more. The smell isn&#x27;t too over powering and the color is a nice bronze color, not orange and not too muddy brown.</li>
    <li> I have used many lotions, and stumbled upon this one and decided I might as well try it out. Im so glad I did! For the price, you cant get a better lotion. It goes on smoothly and smells pretty good. From what I have seen, it is both popular for men and women. The scent is definitely not too feminine to where a man wouldnt want to use it. The bottle is also suitable for men and women.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews on here about it being \\&quot;watery\\&quot;...I&#x27;m sorry to say, you may have gotten a fake because this stuff is for sure not watery. It goes on smooth, and it&#x27;s nice and thick so you can control it better. A little goes a long way! I&#x27;m fair skinned, but I&#x27;ve been able to tan okay in the past. But, this lotion is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!! Quicker results mean less time in the bed, and as much as we hate to admit it, the less time in the bed, the better. Bronzers have always been a pain for me because of streaking but this one doesn&#x27;t do that. Much like other users have said, pleeeeeeaaaaassseee wash your hands. The first time I used this I just did a quick wipe down with a towel on my hands and didnt see anything, so I thought I was in the clear. This stuff keeps working for hours after you use it, so eventually I had the dreaded stained palm! But it was such a pretty golden brown color it didn&#x27;t bother me too badly haha :) If you&#x27;re on the fence, just look at the price. It&#x27;s worth a shot, and if used correctly, I am positive you will enjoy it and get the deep, solid color you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
    <li> The lotion is really great.  You get really dark really fast.  A lot of it is because of the bronzers but thats to be expected.  I love the instant gratification of this lotion. Highly Recommend!!</li>
    <li> I liked the lotion BUT you do have to be careful and make sure you don&#x27;t leave any on your hands or around knee caps. I&#x27;ve had weird patches a time or two if I&#x27;m not careful.&lt;br /&gt;Overall worth the buy!!</li>
    <li> I like how fast it shipped and the price, but it doesn&#x27;t get you that dark. The lotion works good to keep your skin hydrated but the bronzer wasn&#x27;t that great. I figured being 100x the bronzer would look awesome but you can&#x27;t really tell after using it for a few weeks now I am just as dark as I would have been tanning without it.</li>
    <li> this lotion is said to be one of the top selling lotonsfo a quick tan the smell is great and it does tan quickly</li>
    <li> Long time tanner,I love this lotion!! Smells great, not the burnt skin smell for sure, it seems to keep darkening my body even after im done tanning. I&#x27;ve only been using this bout 2 weeks now and am really dark. I have Irish in me so its a little harder for me to tan without the burn but this product delivered well!! I have recommended this product to my sister and friends to try out as well vs the bottles that we and they have spent hundreds of dollars on and not great results. I will be buying this product again soon. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for two weeks and I have gotten darker then I did with any other lotion.</li>
    <li> great product start seeing results fast and smells great which is really important and not oily. this product is one of the best to get you great color with dedicated tanning</li>
    <li> I had to cut back on how much of the bronzer I was putting on because I was getting too dark. Great, cheap, product!</li>
    <li> This is your run-of-the-mill tanning lotion. It did okay, but I didn&#x27;t get amazing color. It also has an unpleasant smell after you get out of the tanning bed. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again. I probably would have been really pissed if I had thrown away $60 at the tanning salon for this product, but luckily I didn&#x27;t waste too much money by ordering it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Love love love . I&#x27;m not able to go tanning everyday . But the free times I have used this lotion I&#x27;ve seen a change every time . Smells amazing as well .</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with this tanning lotion. Have only been 3 times and can already tell a huge difference. I have very dry skin and most tanning lotions only make it worse. Millenium tanning lotion does not dry out my skin! I will never use another brand :)</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works well it doesn&#x27;t have that funky smell that you sometimes get with salon tanning lotions and it DOES NOT stain this white, white, white girl orange!&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Gives me great color. Im fairskinned with freckles. Only downside is the bronzer will stain your hands so wash them or bring baby wipes to the salon</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion! It smells great, cheap price compared to others, and I have only tanned with it twice and I can really tell a difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> I recommend this to anyone! I was nervous buying tanning lotion online but I have used it for a month and had no problems, no orange color, no streaks. This product is amazing! The seller ships so fast, and I will buy from them in the future. I am so happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Works better than any lotion i have ever used!!! Has given me a beautiful , even tan... will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> I dig it...it doesn&#x27;t stink or stain...also does not color you orange...just nice and brown! And great for the price!</li>
    <li> Great product at great value. And ships to Canada! Perfect!</li>
    <li> this lotion is awesome, you do get a darker tan with this lotion. I have my own tanning bed and I have tried a lot of lotions and this is the best one so far and it&#x27;s a great price! Some tanning bed salons sell this lotion for $60 or more.</li>
    <li> This lotion is EXPIRED! Do not buy!!!!!! The expiration date has been rubbed off. But it is grey instead of the bronze color it&#x27;s suppose to be and smells terrible!!!</li>
    <li> It works great, the only problem I have with it is the fragrance. Everyone raved about how good it smelled, to me it smells like burnt coconut.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have no problems tanning but using this product for sure get me much darker in less than half the time.&lt;br /&gt;This is the 2nd time I am buying it and I have no complaints. Save money and buy this. Consistently good product.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!</li>
    <li> This was a very smooth transaction. Package arrived as promised  and expected. Would do repeat business with this seller again in the future.</li>
    <li> I switched to this lotion two days ago and it&#x27;s working wonders after only two tanning sessions! Leaves a nice, highlighted brown color, no orange! The lotion smells great and leaves your skin very moisturized!</li>
    <li> this stuff works better than the stuff I&#x27;ve spent 40-50 bucks on! works as listed and gets you super dark for the price!</li>
    <li> The best lotion I have ever bought</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> Leaves you orange!!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! Came the next day!!</li>
    <li> This lotion gives a great brown tan and quickly! The only reason I gave it a  4 star is because it has sunless tanner in it, so it can leave streaks if you don&#x27;t rub it in or wipe it off your hands well enough.</li>
    <li> Went from being white to a a ice natural tan within a week. Did exactly what it said in the description and I was very pleased. The small wasn&#x27;t to pleasant but I shower anyways after so that wasn&#x27;t a bad thing. some people are feel fishy getting tanning lotion through this but I had an overall good experience.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week and people have been really noticing how tan I&#x27;m getting.  I did have a base tan when i started it and use the highest level beds at the place I go (high pressure beds) so a combination might be also contributing to it.  Good smell, thicker lotion, does not leave streaks on me either but I am careful to wipe it off my hands after applying.  Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and but the product itself did not work well in my opinion, it might just be my skin type though.  I used this for the tanning bed and didn&#x27;t notice much of a change.</li>
    <li> I have a tanning bed &amp; a swimming pool. Needless to say, I love to tan  !  Trust me when I say I have spent lots of money on accelerators etc.  Not only was the price more than reasonable, it truly works so much better than my other products.  If you try it you will never want to use anything else.  Oh, did I mention it smells amazing !!!</li>
    <li> I got super dark using this product, even my bff started using it and has thanked me more times than I can remember for turning her on to this. You won&#x27;t regret buying this, it didn&#x27;t leave a harsh after tan smell that some lotions can. I follow up with Juicy tan extender and love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
    <li> I love this shop. I hatease spending a bunch of money on anything...especially tanning lotion. The store has the best prices and great service. I got the lotion and really fast and it works great!</li>
    <li> MUST apply evenly and wash hands. It will streak and turn hands a little bronze. It does have a good color and will enhance your tan to a deeper brown.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my boyfriend who tans but is a lumberjack looking manly man. He likes the way it smells and it works very well!</li>
    <li> I feel like it did help me tan quicker than normal.  Nothing extraordinary though. I felt close to burning one day, I don&#x27;t think it moisturizes as well as it should and now use aloe with it before I tan.</li>
    <li> Left my skin extremely splotchy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you need to get tan quickly for a special event or want to get a boost on summer skin!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not an everyday lotion. I rotate between an intensifier with minimum bronzer and this lotion. Everyday use caused an orange tint to my skin and build up in the creases on my knees and between my fingers. A good bronzer to use a couple times a week though.</li>
    <li> I was tanning without using any tanning bed lotion. I have used this product for one week and already have a dark tan. This product adds moisture while working to achieve that great dark tan. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but price is ok.  This lotion helps me keep my tan the longest w/ a great color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid indoor tanner for over 7 years ever since I started tanning for my senior prom in high school. Always knew the benefit of using good products and usually tend to buy Designer Skin and Australian Gold products. Black &amp; Obsidian were my go-to until I used the very last drop of my Obsidian and knew I had to get tan before a very important event. Pressed for cash I saw the rave reviews of Solid Black and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the texture, although it didn&#x27;t feel as silky as Black or Obsidian does in terms of being a silicone lotion. The initial smell is nice, but a very run-of-the-mill scent when it comes to tanning lotions. The after smell...oh lord. Probably the WORST after tanning odor I&#x27;ve ever come across. A mixture of burnt skin and body odor (I&#x27;m a VERY clean person, btw) that lingered most of the day. Ugh. Not cute. As for the color, it was ehh. Not the darkest I&#x27;ve been, not the worst. Just ehh. For being a &amp;#34;100x&amp;#34; black bronzer, I expected to be BLACK within a few sessions. Nope. I usually only have time to tan about twice a week and this just really didn&#x27;t do it justice. If you&#x27;re looking for a true deep, dark, intense bronzer, look elsewhere! You get what you pay for :(</li>
    <li> This product does not work! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed at difference at all! I use the highest level beds at my salon too.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and I Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This product is ok..nothing special. Just make sure to take either some wet ones or some kind of wipe to wipe your hands off after application....it WILL turn your hands orange.</li>
    <li> This may be a decent lotion for a beginner, but as an advanced tanner I was definitely disappointed.  The lotion smells good, but did nothing for my tan.</li>
    <li> This is a very good lotion. Gives me great color and feels good. Very well worth the money if your wanting a  good lotion</li>
    <li> Love it will buy again. After 2 weeks I could tell I BIG DIFFERENCE</li>
    <li> This is my least favorite lotion I have ever used. It leaves a strong self tanning lotion smell and the lotion balls up on your skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t much of a bronzer, it hasn&#x27;t done anything for me at all.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. The only negative is that you have to wipe off the excess after tanning or you will get some brown streaks. I have very sensitive skin, and have not had a single problem with this stuff. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product left my skin all orange colored after using it for a few days.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed how fast I had received the tanning lotion. I also think it is a great brand and I have gotten extremely dark by using it. It does NOT disappoint what so ever. I would recommend it to any who tans and wants a great product. DO NOT buy tanning lotion from a tanning salon. It is not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> Me and my hubby visit the gym three times a week. We also love to tan. We used a couple of Luminary products before but the effect was not so fast as \\&quot;Solid Black\\&quot;. I like the product, the shipping was fast and I&#x27;ll recommend this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is great!! It bronzes you in a nice golden color and not orange like others, I just started tanning and have been to the salon 3 times this week with this lotion and already Ive had people notice how tan I am! The reviews are right it has a nice smell and leaves your skin so soft! Great buy for your money indeed :)</li>
    <li> I received this package from the seller within 3 days of ordering. I used it right away at the tanning salon. I had just begun to tan again after many years and the salesgirl at the salon talked me into a very expensive bottle of intensifier. The second time I went in, I used this product and the results were amazingly different.The bronze tone my skin has taken (which has lasted for three days now so I am convinced that it is not a fluke) is terrific. My skin feels great and the smell of this lotion is wonderful, before and after use in the bed. I will be buying again when I run out. I would also recommend to anyone. Much better product than the one I was sold at the salon.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.Bought this product a few times now and very happy with the results.Nice tan without the orange tint like others.Many comments how dark I am and I am a fairer skinned person.will definitely buy again and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Ive used this brand of lotion before but have always gone with PAINT IT BLACK because i was weary of trying anything with 100x! I am latina and am already tan but still like to use the tanning beds before the season, ive been going for two weeks so i already have my base coat and i wanted to intensify my tan so i went ahead and made the 100x purchase and i LOVE it!!! i will never use another item, i literally only had to tan twice with this to reach the color i wanted! shipping was fast, ordered on a friday shipped on a monday and got it on a wednesday. 5 stars all around!</li>
    <li> If someone really paid 99 dollars for this, I feel sorry for them. This lotion smells pretty good but for claiming to be \\&quot;100X Bronzer\\&quot; and using it for over two weeks, I am not much darker than I was when I used the cheap lotion from my salon. I feel like I look really dark a short time after tanning then poof - it&#x27;s mostly gone. Also, it turns my palms and in between my fingers a gross orange color when I don&#x27;t wipe them off completely. I guess for only paying $17, I can&#x27;t complain much but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion smells like heaven, even after tanning it STILL smells like heaven. I&#x27;ve been tanning one time in a year (yesterday) and I used this lotion. I came off the beach (I was there for two hours) looking more golden than I ever have from one tan. I absolutely love this lotion. It IS important to leave bronzers on at least three hours after tanning because you will keep darkening if you do, even without sunlight. I wasn&#x27;t able to do that as I had things to do, so I guarantee I would have gotten even darker had I not washed it off right after tanning (or gone in that beautiful big blue gulf of mexico.. LOL) Either way, it worked great. And I love it. What a BARGAIN, too! It came in like 3 days.. which just reflects on how AWESOME this seller is, as well. :)</li>
    <li> I was little scared to buy this at first, because come on now, $90 lotion for $18? So I was nervous on if it was legit or not, it was a quick delivery, ordered it on a Sunday and received it on a Wed. so pretty good timing, I have only tanned 3 times, with no base tan, and have seen drastic change! I look so much darker, and there is no bad smell to it after tanning. The only thing I do not like about it \\&quot;stains\\&quot; your skin if you leave like a clump, like inbetween fingers. I honestly do not think this is the real solid black, mainly because usually with more expensive lotions, the bottle are nice, this bottle is not so nice, lol. But I am not complaining, I love this lotion so far!</li>
    <li> It only takes a few tans with this lotion to get dark. Just make sure you put it on evenly, if you miss a spot, you will notice it. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is because I noticed when using it after awhile, I came out the bed and went outside smelling burnt, mostly my hands, it just smells like I have been fried. It&#x27;s disgusting, It doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.. I stopped using it and the smell was gone, so I know for sure it was the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: -Gets you dark&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: -Smells burnt after getting out of the bed&lt;br /&gt;-Can streak if you don&#x27;t spread evenly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on using it, please make sure you wash your hands after applying it.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion!! A must have ....if u tan and dont have lots of time to tan use this lotion go 3 days a week and boom u have a great tan!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion about a month ago and just used it for my first time today! Shipping was fast, and even though this was my first time tanning today I can already see a difference with only 6 minutes in the tanning bed!!!!!  I usually have a hard time tanning and this product made a HUGE difference.  I will stick to this brand from now on!  Be sure to wipe off access lotion between your fingers though because i noticed i didnt and i can see a line but ive seen this with other lotions also.  Really works great though, hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> Not sure what else to say other than bronzes great, smells good, and the price is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a must buy!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have used, ever and I have been tanning for YEARS!!! I am really nicely brown, not orange. I get compliments all the time on my nice skin coloring. My husband who is very fair and barely tans, is actually brown! He never gets a tan, and mystic bothered his skin. Not with this lotion. He is loving the new, tanned skin. I am in buying another bottle for my husband now. You HAVE to try it! The price is fantastic, and way cheaper than the ones you buy in the salon.. PLUS - This one works way better. Definately 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> I have a strong preference for lotions that have good bronzers in them. This lotion has become a favorite of mine. The darker the tan the better. Will continue to reorder.</li>
    <li> I AM A SERIOUS TANNER AND JUST RETURNED HOME FROM TWO WEEKS IN ST. LUCIA.  I WAS TANNING WITH PRODUCT FROM MY TANNING SALON AND THOUGHT I WOULD BUY THIS AS IT WAS 100X - BUT I AM ACTUALLY LOSING MY TAN.  I USE THE ULTRA LEVEL 4 AND LEVEL 5 BEDS - BRONZING BEDS - AND THIS LOTION IS NOT DOING THE TRICK.  MY TANNING SALON SAID THAT IT DEPENDS ON HOW SELLERS STORE THESE PRODUCTS - IF THEY ARE TOO OLD, OR ARE IN A COLD OR EXTREMELY WARM STORAGE BUILDING, THEY MAY LOSE THEIR POTENTCY.</li>
    <li> This product is very cheap and doesn&#x27;t give you the tan that it says it does .I learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> Will definitely order this again</li>
    <li> I order this every few months because there&#x27;s no way in hell I&#x27;m going to pay upwards of $80 for a bottle of tanning lotion at my local tanning salon. It does what it needs to do. I get tanned very fast (I must mention, being middle eastern, I get tanned super quick). But this stuff is great, no horrible smell, cheap, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I truly love this tanning lotion. This is my second year purchasing this product and I will continue to use it for years to come.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I have bought this product several times. I get very dark. Only problem is if you aren&#x27;t extremely careful in applying evenly, you will see a line because it makes you that much darker in just one tan. I have had compliments on the smell but I think it smells like I just finished tanning. As long as you use an extender that smells great this scent is covered anyways. I will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> The reasoning for my 3 star review is this; ITS NOT REAL! I took this lotion to my tanning salon and the owner got the actual lotion off the shelf and we poured both into different cups to compare. This lotion is more pink/orange than the actual sold black! The smell is also different! With that being said I did enjoy the smell of this lotion and its performance, just make sure to wash your hands after you use it because if you tan without washing, your palms will be orange for days!!!</li>
    <li> I have used twice so far and can see good results.  It works just as well as any product I can get at my tanning salon which would cost $100 or more.  Also works just as well as the $45 product I ordered previously.  I have no problem with the scent - smells like a mild tanning lotion and doesn&#x27;t leave much of a scent afterwards.  All in all, a great buy for the price.  I received it within two days of ordering.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I have a tanning bed at home and have tried tons of tanning lotions over the years.  Both my mom and I have agreed this is the best we&#x27;ve had yet.  It works very quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell horrible.  Actually, I really like the smell.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t stain as long as you wipe out in between your fingers as soon as you apply.</li>
    <li> So I usually do not take the time to come back and write a review, but this time I had to. The smell after you tan is absolutely horrific!! I had to shower shortly after because the smell was strong and just not pleasant. I almost felt like I smelt like car oil. I also am not noticing that much of a difference from this lotion as opposed to others I used regarding getting darker.</li>
    <li> Arrived Quickly. Noticed immediate results. Does not leave u feeling sticky or wet. Does not have a great smell but not a bad smell either. Would definitely order again and recommend if u want a nice brown tan, no streaks or orange effects.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  tan and this product is not the greatest , its more like a self tanner it leaves streaks and blotches if u do not rub it in correctly, I rubbed it in very well and I think it still makes u look orange</li>
    <li> love the color its giving me after a week. I am very happy with this lotion Thanks</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned and go to the UVB beds to get a color. Love this stuff! This is way better than the $75-$100 bottles that the tanning salons sells. Best when I tan at night and shower the next day.  Beautiful color.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> Amazing lotion for the price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great...just remember to wash your hands immediately.</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price. I still get orange lines between my fingers but not as bad as other tanning lotions. It doesn&#x27;t give you that unnatural orange tan. I got a nice light brown color using this and it also has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> Used it 3 times and already have great color! Love it~</li>
    <li> The lotion has a good smell. Make sure to wash your hands or you will get color in between fingers because this does have self tanner in it as well. I used it today in the salon and getting out of the bed, one of my legs were completely streaked sections missing color. You need to be real careful using this, I would rather buy a self tanner or use jergans natural glow due to that way color would be even. I rubbed in all the way and made sure and I forgot that this lotion streaks. Would try another brand next time. I bought this based on reviews and I have light skin but not again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I get the best tan in a short amount of time. Always packed and shipped secure and arrives in no time.</li>
    <li> this product is okay i expected more of a tan from it i prob wont buy again i might try its sister lotion</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money at the salon. This works! And your saving 50-80 buck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of different tanning lotions and this lotion has gotten me darker than the expensive lotions. Everyone has noticed that I&#x27;ve gotten darker. Not orange but bronzed! Make sure you wipe your hands off after putting the lotion on but that goes for every bronzing lotion. Im a regular tanner and im WOWED about this lotion!</li>
    <li> i chose 5 star  for this lotion because this lotion does the job!!! great product and this is great price</li>
    <li> This stained my skin and was so uneven when i put it on! you could literally see lines and it was a terrible orange color:(</li>
    <li> Just received this two days ago and immediately went to the tanning salon.. Read so many good reviews on this product,  and I must say EVERYTHING everyone states Is true! I saw immediate results after ONE ssession.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  Skin felt amazing after wards and so nice and silky. ( product definitely is not oily, leaves no residue. )  Needless to say even after tanning it smelled great......Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love it... I could tell a difference in a matter of 2-3 days&#x3D;!!!!!thank u Amazon</li>
    <li> Wow, great stuff. Works well</li>
    <li> I loved this product at a fraction of the price I would of paid in the salon excellent quality I look great</li>
    <li> It was a pleasure doing business with you. Item was quickly received and nicely packaged. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for better.</li>
    <li> I had a wonderful experience as a regular tanner for about 4 months ... used other products with only one&lt;br /&gt;other product that I was satisfied with.  The other had a tingling additive, which can lead to pain.&lt;br /&gt;This product delivers practically everything I was looking for to have to only go tan for once a week. I have a great base tan.&lt;br /&gt;and when no sun, with about 10% american native in my traits(this is for reference for considered buyer.&lt;br /&gt;I am not really tan without the uv(sun or bed), really pale, but have good tanning qualities.&lt;br /&gt;This product has ultimately given me a chance to STAY OUT of the CANCER CAUSING rays.  I love it, Im going to stick&lt;br /&gt;with it.  no splotchiness AT ALL. When first exiting the bed.  I saw 3 shades darker. As a couple of days went by, I would say 10 shades darker.  I stay at this tone for one week and then the tan begins to fade SLOWLY.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and have already recommended to family members.</li>
    <li> This is my go to lotion!! I have used this brand for two years now with no complaints. I begin my tanning season with this an usually after being in the sun I try out a few others out there. But I always go back to old faithful.</li>
    <li> If you want to get tan fast, you have to buy this lotion! No streaking! Love this stuff! It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> I will be first to admit that I have been a victim of buying highly-overpriced lotions in tanning salons.. I really wish I had come across this in Amazon ages ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema and tan in small doses every now and then to keep symptoms at bay.  I like using a lotion to keep my skin somewhat hydrated before I go in the beds, and I found that this lotion really does the job.&lt;br /&gt;What I particularly liked is the smell of the lotion!  It&#x27;s not super overwhelming like other tanning lotions, and it actually smells nice.  With other lotions, I would almost smell the chemicals in them.  The effects tan-wise.. I can&#x27;t really attest to them, being that I only go to tan in &amp;#34;small portions&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 1/5 the price of other lotions, you really can&#x27;t lose!</li>
    <li> This product has worked alright for me. When I bought 100x bronzer I was worried that it waas going to make me a funny orange tinge and make me instantly look fake, but that is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;I tan quite easy, and after about 3 weeks of use, I have a nice golden tan. My fiancée who bought the same product who has been using it the exact same amount as me, is about half as dark as me. So it works different for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of it, and will continue to use it. If i compare the tan of my upper body to my lower body, there is just a marginal difference. ( I only use the lotion on my upper body )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would say its okay. Its the first lotion iv ever used so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
    <li> it will drken me up for a few days then it fades, it also streaks really bad!!! and it doesnt smell very good</li>
    <li> gives me a fast tan, i lovee only reason im not using is because of my tattoos fading</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t work and I tan very well. Wish I could give zero stars! Wish I had contacted the seller.</li>
    <li> AMAZING ...Recommended ^^</li>
    <li> So far I really like this lotion. I can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s helping me get any darker, but it has a nice smell and feels nice also.</li>
    <li> For the price, I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Arrived as stated and is exactly what I ordered</li>
    <li> For the price you pay, you can&#x27;t beat this.  You get dark, and it doesn&#x27;t turn you orange.  I personally really like the smell, too!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain. Picture a dirty old penny. That&#x27;s what color I am now.</li>
    <li> Really good product at a much better price than at the tanning salons! Will definitely purchase again. Shipment was quick, always a plus!!</li>
    <li> This lotion got me so dark I LOVE IT. I will definaly buy again without a doubt. I highly recommend if you want a dark tan fast.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! But I like alot of bronzers and it doesn&#x27;t make u look orange. It gives me a real nice tan color. I bought this product twice now. It&#x27;s a good company:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not someone who tans easily, this product is amazing, I can tell the difference...I am now as dark as I&#x27;ve always wanted to be and it didn&#x27;t take all summer!!!</li>
    <li> This item was shipped super fast (within 4 days!). ive used it everytime since i bought it and it works wonderful! I am beyond pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a simple, nice tanning lotion. The smell is nice, doesn&#x27;t leave you with that \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; smell. Bronzer is very mild. I am fair skinned and I don&#x27;t notice any real bronzing quality compared to other bronzers. Lotion is moisturizing. For the price this is an ok tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I got this lotion after using another lotion that has a high silicone base and DHA in it and I loved the color it gave e just after a few uses as I tan easy and go at least twice weekly. The smell is ver nice, but You do get a slight after tanning smell. I have yet found a lotion that does not have that unfortunate flaw, overall this lotion is a good one if your looking for a bronze non streaky DHA lotion!</li>
    <li> love it! lots of bronzers in it which all good lotions should have. service was wonderful, got it when they said I would.</li>
    <li> So I read many review on this and it was cheap so I decided to go ahead and buy it. I don&#x27;t even use it now thought. It worked ok, but not how everyone said it would. Everyone said they noticed a difference immediately but that was not the case here. I did in fact notice though that if you even miss the slightest spot rubbing it in you will have an organge/brown mark left behind there. I also found that no matter how much scrubbing of the hands you do after applying it you still manage to have orange hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between my fingers was awful. I had gross brown lines everywhere. If you want to take the time to apply this product with intense concentration go for it, but if you are going to apply it quickly right before you jump in the tanning bed, this isn&#x27;t the product for you. You will have discolored hands and posisbly other spots!</li>
    <li> This worked great for tanning.</li>
    <li> Works good for what I need it for-- especially at this price! I have a hard time tanning, but was able to get some color this past summer with the help of this. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favourite lotion (and the least expensive) that I have ever purchased. I&#x27;ve been tanning for 15 years.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, spreads on silky and smooth, my skin feels and smells so great, i hate to wash it off. I own a tanning bed, and this is the best I&#x27;ve used yet. I will def be back for a refill!</li>
    <li> For 12 bucks you cannot beat this lotion, works amazing, being irish and polish and having freckles using this im a beautiful bronzed color realllyyyyyy dark! Compared to the lotions sold in salons and stores, it&#x27;s a nobrainer.</li>
    <li> LIKE IT. IT SMELLS GREAT BUT LEAVES YOUR HANDS ORANGE.</li>
    <li> Good lotion for the price.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the 5 star reviews on this, I decided to try it. I used it for the first time yesterday and after the initial perfumey odor wore off...my after tan scent (stink) was horrible. I am returning it. This is the beauty of ordering from Amazon. No sweat if you are unhappy. Just send it back.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion does not tan as well as I would like.  I&#x27;m going to order another brand of lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Its smooth and smells good before and after tanning. I read all the same great reviews before I ordered and they&#x27;re true. I peaked with my old lotion and it smelled gross. I needed something new and something that smelled better. I noticed a difference in how dark I got immediately, even other people have made comments on how dark I was getting.</li>
    <li> Smells okay, seems like a good bronzer, takes too much effort to keep from &amp;#34;over bronzing&amp;#34; hands, feet, knees, elbows, etc.  You almost need to prep with blending lotion before using this.  Knees just look dirty and you end up with ombre hands and feet.  Did not know it was such a commitment.  Gave my bottle to a friend with a bronzer addiction.</li>
    <li> Saw immediate results love it</li>
    <li> This is the worst tanning lotion I have ever used.  It turns your skin orange and looks like you have used a cheap self tanner.  I just wasted my money on this product!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this tanning accelerator twice now, and my wife and I love it! Try to buy this at a tanning salon and you&#x27;ll have to pay around $50! I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very very pale and after using this a couple of times I got a really nice color going on!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not getting me dark fast enough, i was hoping to be much bronzer by now. maybe next time I will</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on it&#x27;s high reviews. Yes, I noticed after one use that I had a nice brown color. It seems to be working well for color. The smell of it is ok in the bottle, but after lying in the tanning bed, it gets that gross instant tanner smell. I started to carry perfume with me for after I tan. Also, be sure to wipe your hands after applying BEFORE you actually tan. It gets between your fingers, around your nails, and stays on your palms. Once you tan, your palms will turn orange-y, and you will have the nasty orange between your fingers as you would with an instant tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the result of this lotion. It just requires some &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; to not be orange or smell funky.</li>
    <li> Great smell and good quick dark results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a strawberry blonde, so I can tan but its extremely hard &amp; at my tannest it&#x27;s very light. This product made me very dark in just one session! I&#x27;m extremely satisfied &amp; happy because I&#x27;m brown, not orange. I haven&#x27;t had any streaking issues. All previous lotions have streaked or turned me orange and still kept me a light shade. So I&#x27;m very happy I came across this product. This also minimizes my exposure to having to tan everyday to keep somewhat of a color, to only having to tan once every 10 days! The smell is very nice as well. It reminds me of my old Victoria&#x27;s Secret body lotion. Which surprised me! I highly recommend this product! :-)</li>
    <li> This product arrived very quickly, and definitely makes you dark quickly, however streaks very easily.  I attempted to rub the lotion in completely and still have noticable streaks on my legs.</li>
    <li> I liked this tanning lotion.  It isn&#x27;t too thick and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. It does streak a little if you don&#x27;t rub it in real good.</li>
    <li> Its ok not as good as it is rated</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! Last a long time, and you can see results very quickly!! I&#x27;ve had the same bottle going on 3 summers (didn&#x27;t lay in the tanning bed last summer) and it still works just as good as it did the first time I used it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice and I look like I&#x27;ve been tanning for weeks! Excellent price it&#x27;s definitely worth more than what it sells for! I&#x27;ve used $70 lotions and haven&#x27;t even seen results like this :)</li>
    <li> It was good lotion at first, but then it leaves orange spots and streaks. Smells great though. TURNS VERY ORANGE IF OVER USED</li>
    <li> This bronzer does the trick  But be careful because it will streak and settle into dry arches and ankles.  Love that it has a very nice scent. But the scent doesn&#x27;t linger.  Best to use after a shower when your skin is still moist.  I use it after every other shower.</li>
    <li> I used this product in the tanning booth and found it works Great for outdoor&#x27;s.. Keep you nice and bronzed all summer,,,</li>
    <li> Made me super dark and all of my friends were envious but i mean i also tan really well so that probably had some to do with it. Overrall I so suggest buying this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful !&lt;br /&gt;SUper dark and doesn&#x27;t &#x27;&#x27;roll&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> every time i tan with this lotion i get compliments. &amp;#34;OMG you look so tannn!!!&amp;#34; People always ask me what lotion I use when leaving the salon. I love this lotion! Works extremely well when used daily or every other day. But you are noticably darker with just one use. Definitely make sure to cleanse hands well after using (I bring sanitizer), and spend plenty of time rubbing this lotion in, because it will leave streaks if not completely rubbed in. Smell is not too powerfull, but also a nice sweet chocolately scent. GET IT!</li>
    <li> This is the 9th bottle I have purchased in 2 years from different vendors. I purchased 4 bottles from this vendor,  I&#x27;m disappointed&lt;br /&gt;with the first bottle I opened it has too much orange dye and streaks badly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed! I had the paint it black and thought this one might make me even darker but all it did was leave &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; like blotches all over me! I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and used many lotions and have never had a problem this bad. Even after showering 2x and shaving and scrubbing it won&#x27;t come off! I&#x27;m so bummed. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!</li>
    <li> Very very good tanning lotion one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;It really keeps you dark for close to a week after two vistis.</li>
    <li> works very well good conditional</li>
    <li> My tanning salon that I use, hates that I buy my lotions on Amazon, but it is just such a savings, and it does a perfect job of helping me get tan, without a gross smell.</li>
    <li> Ive been using the solid black by millenium and I love it. My skin doesn&#x27;t tan easily, but with the solid black I get so dark. I recommend it to anyone that likes a nice dark tan. It lasts forever, had it for 2 months now and its still full. The best part is...no streaks! Even better part, the price!!</li>
    <li> Really happy with my purchase. It works great, in fact I am going to purchase more. For the price you can&#x27;t beat this product</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t trade this lotion for any other!&lt;br /&gt;It shipped fast, smells great, give me a sexy bronze, and worked Way faster than I thought it would!</li>
    <li> NEVER BEEN THAT INTO BRONZERS, I DONT TAN SO EASILY SO  I GO FOR THE MORE DEEP TAN, BUT ITS NICE TO MIX IT UP TRY NEW THINGS,, I LIKED THIS ONE</li>
    <li> why pay for those expensive lotions.  This one works great. i plan to order it again. Quality was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> SOLID BLACK WITH 100X BRONZER IS FANTASIC JUST ABOUT WHERE I WANT TO BE NOW THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS FANTASIC PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I Absolutely Love This Tanning Lotion...  It Has A Great Smell To It...  The Scent Reminds Me Of Yankee Candle - Mancave Sort Of...  So It&#x27;s Good For Men Or Women...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty cheap about tanning lotions, and I&#x27;ve really never had a tan because of it.  This stuff works GREAT!  You have to be careful putting it on tho...if it&#x27;s not even you WILL have streaks!  And wipe your hands off before you get in the tanning bed.  I have VERY DARK brown spots between my fingers that will NOT wash off lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little torn on this product which is why I gave it 3 stars. I LOVE the Solid Black 50x so I thought I would try the 100x with the thought that it would be even more than what I already loved in the 50x (more is better right?) wrong. There appears to be a lot of self tanner in this lotion, so much that I smelled like self tanner all day. It also left darker streaks between my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I figured out how to use this stuff it has been much better.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a decent tanning bed lotion after taking the following precautions:  just be very conscious about applying EVENLY and make sure that you wipe all of it off of your hands before jumping in the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this product again though, I will go back to my favorite, the Solid Black 50x</li>
    <li> I will purchase this again.  This is the darkest I&#x27;ve ever gotten and I use a older 20 minute bed.</li>
    <li> This lotion really is great. One precaution I would take however is making sure you immediately wipe your hands and in between your fingers after application. I failed to do this and got orange in between my fingers for a week lol</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t used to believe in tanning lotions. I just thought they were company&#x27;s tools to get $60+ dollars out of you. I think its absolutely absurd to pay that much for tanning lotion. However, I am going to the beach soon and want to get a good base tan beforehand so I don&#x27;t burn to a crisp. I wanted to try out some lotion to see if it would work, but there was no way I was going to shell out a ton of money for it so I decided to see Amazon&#x27;s prices. I found this lotion, saw the price was really reasonable and it had good reviews so I decided to try it out. I&#x27;ve only used it once (yesterday) and I seriously look like I tanned for several days. I went to the tanning bed maybe 3 times before yesterday and was slightly tanner, but today I can really tell a difference. Also, I stayed 10 minutes; before, the longest was 8 and I started at 6. So whether the difference in tan is due to the longer time or the lotion or a combination of both, I will never know. One thing I really really liked about this lotion was that the smell wasn&#x27;t slapping me in the face the rest of the day like other lotions. The smell was still there, but mild and kind of nice. So in terms of price, smell, and tan difference, I highly highly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re very fair skinned, be careful because the self tanner in the lotion can be streaky orange after a couple of uses</li>
    <li> Pretty much what the title says. Left me orangey and the smell was ok but I couldn&#x27;t seem to get it off my body. Wont ever buy again. Was my first try at tanning in YEARS so I thought hey I should maybe get some sort of lotion. NOT this, I think it has scared me away from bronzers. YUCK YUCK YUCK</li>
    <li> This lotion works great. I have used it 3 times and notice a significant difference in color. I would highly recommend for anyone trying to get dark quick</li>
    <li> I like it.  You just have to make sure to wash your hands after applying because the bronzer will stain.</li>
    <li> I purchased Solid Black from a tanning salon before so I had an expectation of what I would be using when I ordered this online. Upon opening this bottle, I found a runny, LITERALLY BLACK mess of a tanning lotion. Not thrilled. I guess that&#x27;s why they tell you not to buy tanning lotion online!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two weeks (7 tanning sessions) - half in a bed, half stand up.  While the silicone in the product allows for the cream to be spread evenly and smoothly, the actual tan isn&#x27;t that great.  My fingers are a bit orange/yellow (even though I wash immediately after tanning) and the browser sticks to my dry spots.  The cream smells awesome and is very, very moisturizing. I find I can still smell it after I shower the next day.  I even have compliments! So while the tan isn&#x27;t the darkest one ever, the cream is decent.</li>
    <li> This works great, but you have to be careful, at least I do, because it streaks on me.  Didn&#x27;t realize it until the next day later in the day light.</li>
    <li> very impressed, I have a great base tan after only going four times, people have commented on how nice it looks.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great price, arrived VERY quick, packaged safely...but I did not get ANY color at all when I tanned with this lotion. I have been tanning for 22 years &amp; this is the worst tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I gave it to my 24 yr old daughter &amp; she uses it at the pool &amp; says it works okay for her. Didn&#x27;t work for me in the tanning beds though. ???</li>
    <li> Love this, works great, good results  I would use this again. Delivery was fast. Price was excellent great lotion I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This lotion was just way to orange for me. I found the black bronzers give you a nice look. The bronzers are like subtle self tanner and it was just too orange. Even turned my hands orangish.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion! It was delivered in less time than expected and it works! I have taken my tan to next level! And LOVE IT! Will use again and again!</li>
    <li> I only tan once a week and this product gives much more bronze for the buck. The tanning salon lotions are outrageously expensive and I searched high and low for a more affordable alternative. I am extremely happy with the results.</li>
    <li> My tan looks like I was on a tropical island. Nice bronze tone. I am Olive skin naturally but this lotion brings out the bronze to it and it makes my skin feel smooth and it also smells nice. I would purchase it again and also recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what its supposed to do and really well the only bad thing is it has a lot of bronzer so if you use too much you might get a bit orange. So just remember a little goes a long way with this stuff, Especially on your face! It will get you tan super fast so its a great product just be careful not to over use it.</li>
    <li> This is really a good product. It is not greasy at all and smells great. It does not have a tropical perfume smell that so many tanning lotions do. I just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this lotion three times and the only thing I have to complain about is the fact that it turned my hands orange. Everything else is a nice golden color. Cant really complain for the price.</li>
    <li> I do not think that this works very well.  I am fair skinned and it is taking weeks to see any results. I know that they bulbs are strong.</li>
    <li> definitely not top bottle material but it made me tan in a short period of time.. i recommend using a hydrating lotion along with a bronzer so it lasts longer. this is good but you have to rub it in good or it will be a little streaky.</li>
    <li> If you buy this you WILL NOT regret it! It smells so yummy and goes on clean. NO oily nasty feeling!&lt;br /&gt;No greasy after glow. It bronzes and get the job done while making you look like a cali tanned beauty!</li>
    <li> I purchased this about 3 weeks ago, ive used others before and this is my all time favorite, after one time using I can see I was darker. if your looking for a product that is a good price and that&#x27;s going to help get you a little darker this is it...</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion! I got super dark after using this for the first time! I didn&#x27;t turn orange I came out with a pretty golden tan! It also smells amazing (not overpowering). Shipping was really fast! I would highly recommend this lotion if you are looking to get dark fast!</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. Leave you very tanned and dark. However, it leaves that after tanning smell and I can&#x27;t stand that. Will not buy this lotion again. Great seller. Just don&#x27;t like the after-smell.</li>
    <li> Reasonable &amp; works fantastic</li>
    <li> I continue to be a fan of this brand of tanning lotion and don&#x27;t see a reason to switch over. For the price and size of bottle compared to other brands, this is a much better deal and better results in my opinion. I had the 50X before this which was great, but this stuff is even better. I went tanning twice with this and already am tan. The scent is nice too.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> I bought this off amazon and love it!  I usually use the Jwoww line of tanning lotions but decided to give this a try from reviews I read on amazon and so far I can tell the difference a lot faster then the Jwoww one and done i was using just before.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Just make sure you run it in well because otherwise it can be a tiny bit streaky. I noticed a huge difference after using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive ones and cheap ones, and this bronzer is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks, no smell, just leaves a beautiful color.  I use it exclusively on my pale legs and works great.</li>
    <li> I have had Millennium product in my salon for several years. I love the lotions they make! I will order again!</li>
    <li> Works GREAT! I got a base tan faster than normal then maintained a browner color faster!</li>
    <li> Had an ok smell and worked okay</li>
    <li> Darkest I&#x27;ve ever gotten using this product. Skin feels smooth and healthy .</li>
    <li> Works on my Wife, But doesn&#x27;t work for me. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad, id buy it again for my wife</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best tanning lotion I have ever used!!! Makes my skin dark real quick. I also use it outside which gives me a beautiful bronzed glow.</li>
    <li> I am a hard core tanner in the summer.  Tan every day at the tanning bed during the week and then outside on the weekend. I&#x27;m always looking for new products to enhance my tan. When I ran across this product, I read the reviews and decided to try it even though there were more negative things said than positive....MISTAKE!  I have used the product at least a half a dozen times and get the same results everytime which is a big fat nothing!  If you are looking for a product that offers nice results, use Black Storm from the same product line.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal. After 2-15 minute tanning sessions in a stand up booth, I got a couple shades darker. Not orangey either, very natural looking.</li>
    <li> nice product works great smells good too</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever used I have been tanning for year&#x27;s  and have used a lot of  lotions before but this is my number one pick you well see it work fast!!!</li>
    <li> good product easy to apply</li>
    <li> Has a strong smell after using</li>
    <li> i relly like this one</li>
    <li> For the price..you cannot beat the quality. Works better than the 100.00 bottle of Kardashian Glow I bought. The longer you leave it on after tanning the better it works.</li>
    <li> Did not tan any darker for wife!  Went back to snooki</li>
    <li> Stains my white collar shirts even after 3-4 days of showering.Otherwise, smells kinda strong but nice and helps you appear bronze.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I am 62, outside almost everyday. It tans great and darkens every day I &#x27;m out, and the tan lasts and lasts. Have used it all summer, and not in a tanning bed either. Don&#x27;t overuse, because it doesn&#x27;t take much. Great service, too!! A+</li>
    <li> I gave it a shot and when I used it it made me like two shades darker the first time I did it and it made my skin really smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for 10 years I usually use a bronzer with 22X but I made the mistake of trying this one. It does NOT work I would of got a better tan using a basic lotion. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
    <li> Nice product for tanning. I definitely noticed a darker bronzer tan with this lotion than I do with others. Very happy and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this with another lotion and I alternate the two.  I have gotten excellent results . I am olive skinned Cherokee Indian and I get good color but have a hard time getting to the next level... This works!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  I am a fair-skinned redhead and have gotten the best tan ever with this lotion. I use it in the tanning bed and it&#x27;s awesome. I will definately order more!</li>
    <li> By far and away my favorite indoor tanning lotion! It has a pleasant, not at all overpowering smell, and I get better results with this lotion than any other I&#x27;ve tried (including the hideously expensive lotions at the salons). In no time, I build a beautiful, natural-looking tan that would otherwise take me weeks to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note of caution - and this has more to do with lotions in general, not this particular one - make sure you rub it in well, or it will leave streaks and lines. But as I said, that&#x27;s to be expected with any lotion.</li>
    <li> Very nice tan after using.</li>
    <li> Works well as we used this prior to our trip to Mexico at the tanning salon.  It really helped speed up the tanning process but I do wonder if there was some die in this as my hands turned orange color for a day after each use. :)  However, it did help darken the skin and speed the tanning process without turning the rest of the body orange.</li>
    <li> Smells good, goes on smoothly, no streaks.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! I&#x27;ve tried so many...expensive &amp; money savers. I believe lotions really depend on your body chemistry &amp; no matter how many reviews I&#x27;ve read, products I&#x27;ve tried; this particular one is perfect for me:) I&#x27;m about a quarter Native American &amp; have some French Canadian (adopted). I tan very easily, have more red undertones, but can get very pale when I&#x27;m out of the sun. This lotion goes on super smooth without having to use much. As long as I blend it well on my hands &amp; between my fingers, I&#x27;ve never had issues with discolored palms or hands. I do wash about 20 minutes after tanning. My skin is VERY sensitive &amp; this lotion keeps me smooth...I even apply it when I&#x27;m not tanning &amp; it&#x27;s better than a gradual moisturizer (for me). And after all those loves...the scent (after tan smell) is my BFF! Again, it&#x27;s probably not for everyone, but it makes me feel awesome!</li>
    <li> Turned my skin orange the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I alternate with Luminary made by same company.  Solid Black helps deepen the tan it absorbs well and has no funky after smell as other s do.  It does not stain clothing which is a great attribute.</li>
    <li> I did get a pretty good tan with this lotion but it leaves pretty obvious streaks if you don&#x27;t blend it a lot</li>
    <li> I have naturally olive skin so when I go tanning I get pretty dark as it is. I haven&#x27;t really used lotions in the past, I&#x27;ve tried a few randomly but never found one that really did anything different for me. I&#x27;ve seen this product at tanning salons so I went ahead and bought it (pretty inexpensive compared to others).  It smells pretty good and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your skin afterwards. It didn&#x27;t Wow me but I also wasn&#x27;t disappointed with the purchase. For the price-point and fast delivery it worked out pretty well. Again, I have olive skin as it is so it could be an over-the-top product for many others. Maybe a few more tans with it will be perfect.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Love this lotion it&#x27;s the only one I will ever use!!! I&#x27;m fair skinned and its hard for me to get a good base tan going but with this I reach my darkest color in just a week.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! If you are looking for a lotion to get you dark, this is it.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It worked really well, I feel like I got a lot darker using this. It still didn&#x27;t eliminate the burnt smell afterwards but it did meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> Works well, smells great!</li>
    <li> this tanning lotion has a overall pleasant smell. the bronzing agent isn&#x27;t overwhelming. i am a new fan of millenium products now.</li>
    <li> I tan in a top of the line tanner, I thought I&#x27;d be tanner at this point. I do like the smell and feel of it. Jury is still out.</li>
    <li> I only go tanning every few weeks using this tanning lotion. It smells great, goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my tans are deeper since using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased Solid Black because I know the brand was reputable and the reviews were good.  This is the first time I have used a tanning bed lotion so I wanted something that worked.  It&#x27;s a good bronzer (I have very pale skin) yet it did have the odor I didn&#x27;t want to experience.  I tanned at night and ended up going home after the sessions so it didn&#x27;t really affect me too much.  I wouldn&#x27;t use if I had dinner plans after I tan which was the disappointment.  Bottle is strong and cap stays on well so easy to carry around.</li>
    <li> this is very good tanning lotion. i did order it because of the reviews.it was a very good choise.works very fast,the tan is nice and color amazing,not dark .just like gold. i will order it again for sure. the skin after you use it just soft and smooth like after baby lotion.very light smell of the lotion,doesn&#x60;t bother at all.</li>
    <li> The product arrived a few minutes ago and much to my surprise was not sealed in any fashion.  It is not possible to tell if this is new product as there were no tamper proof seals of any kind.  I will trust that I actually got an unopened, new product but I am now skepitcal and disappointed in the packaging.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion, got dark very fast and it stayed.  Have been trying different lotions thought I was at a max with this one, but so far this is the best one.  Service was outstanding I try to buy from them as much as possible.  I had my lotion within a week.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. Anyone who says it streaks is not shaking the bottle before use or leaving it in their car. If you purchase this at a salon, it will cost you 50 + dollars so this pricing is an absolute steal! Thank you for creating such an awesome lotion.</li>
    <li> This is more like a self tanner....which is ok, but if you don&#x27;t know this ahead of time or aren&#x27;t careful how you use it you can get those orangey/brown streaks.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the product works great shipping was on time and do good price would buy again</li>
    <li> This lotion will take you beyond your tanning peak! Lovely fragrance. Feels good on your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless different designer tanning lotions purchased at a hundred dollars per bottle, yet this is still my favorite. I&#x27;ve been using it and reordering for four years now. The bronzer isn&#x27;t orange AT ALL, whereas other lotions in this line will make you look like an Oompa Loompa. I&#x27;ll never buy a different type of tanning lotion than this</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion ! Have been tanning for 3 weeks and have a gorgeous deep brown tan. The tan is so great looking even the girls working at the salon have asked what I am using !!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this tanning lotion for 2 summers in a row. Everyone comments on how fast I get so dark.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this! Apply before a tan and gives you instant color. Smell is not too over powering, but I always shower after tanning.</li>
    <li> Best lotion on the market. Thanks for having it available for purchase so easy without having to depend on the tanning salons.</li>
    <li> My issue with tanning lotions has always been the smell on my skin after I finish tanning. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 3 weeks now and it is phenomenal. I can easily see where I have applied it from the tint and I have never had any streaks or splotches. It leaves a pleasant scent on my skin as well.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it.  He already tans easily this product has helped extend his tan.</li>
    <li> Makes extremely dark after just a few lays and the silicon keeps your skin soft and fabulous looking! This is a must buy! Won&#x27;t be disappointed at all!</li>
    <li> This is a MUST have for indoor tanning.  You can see the difference after the first use.  The smell is pleasant as well</li>
    <li> You do not want to get this as your indoor tanning lotion. You end up 3 to 4 different shades of brown and yellow . It comes out streaked all over no matter how evenly you put it on . I do not recommend it .</li>
    <li> This product was shipped quickly and works great.  I tan a few times every week.  The color I get is great.  The smell is great too!!  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Great color, wish the smell was a little better...very &amp;#34;tann-y&amp;#34;. Other than that no complaints to report at all! Yay!</li>
    <li> My best friend keeps stealing mine so she can get tan faster. The bronzer is really good and really speeds up the tanning process.</li>
    <li> Very good! I got tan a lot faster using it then I was using nothing! The only i didn&#x27;t like was it turns your hands orange if ou don&#x27;t wash it off fast enough! And it&#x27;s kinda hard to go wash your hands before you get in the tanning bed you have no time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 years and it will turn you very dark, but it does have a bronzer that will turn you yellow if you do not apply it evenly.  A good product though.</li>
    <li> I saw my skin darken after my first use.  Very even and does not leave that unpleasant after tanning smell..Highly recommend this tanning product.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m the darkest i&#x27;ve ever been switching to this lotion and i&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and a half. i recommend this to any tanner advanced or beginner. you just have to make sure you rub it in very well and wash your hands after because you will definitely streak and have that caked on feeling if not. it smells good before i tan but after i do get that after tan smell, but you&#x27;ll always have that tanning indoors. i just wait a few hours and then shower but my tan does fade a little each time because of all the bronzer in this but after you keep using it you get dark enough not to really notcie the fading after showering. i&#x27;m going back and forth with this and instantly black tingler every other day. i was very worried about getting an orange tan and i haven&#x27;t but i think if it wasn&#x27;t for me going back and forth with the two lotions i would because of how much bronzer is in it. overall though, i love this lotion and it&#x27;s fast working you just have to be careful with the amount used and it&#x27;s rubbed in all the way</li>
    <li> This will accelerate your tan nicely. You must thoroughly rub the product completely in our you will have streak marks.</li>
    <li> Pick this one trust me I love tanning and have years of experience :)  This one gives excellent results quickly.</li>
    <li> It blends easily into the skin and smells fantastic. The price is also exceptionally good for this quality. Cheaper than buying it at a tanning salon</li>
    <li> Have  always  Loved  this lotion.. After my 1st  order  2 years  ago, it has always been  my go to lotion for immediate and fast  tanning  results.  I will  never  run out of  Solid  Black 100x  and  I  have  other  lotions  also-- always  trying  new  lotions  with  Bronzers  of  course. Just  can&#x27;t  do  tingle...</li>
    <li> Good lotion good bronzing!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. I was noticeably darker within just a few tanning sessions, when normally it takes me a while to tan from the use of a tanning bed. Just remember to wash your hands after application. This product contains a bronzer so your hands WILL turn brown if you don&#x27;t wash it off! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells and it gives you a nice deep tan. I made a good choice with this product!!</li>
    <li> This was a pretty good lotion.  I didn&#x27;t hate the smell, but you have to make sure to get it ALL off your hands or you get dark weird looking streaks between your fingers and around your wrists.</li>
    <li> Considering it is a bornzer I expected a deeper tan, but I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference than another lotions I&#x27;ve used.  It does leave your skin soft so that is a plus.  You really can&#x27;t beat the price either.&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell.  It&#x27;s not strong or overpowering but it seems to stay with me evern after I scrub in the&lt;br /&gt;shower :(</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Tinted just the right amount.</li>
    <li> I have only had the opportunity to use this product once, however, I did manage to get some color in the first time.  I have had various issues with previous lotions.  Anything from smelling icky after I get out of the bed, to an allergic reaction.  This has a light and pleasant smell that sticks with it after the bed.  It has good color, too.</li>
    <li> Absolutely best tanning product ever</li>
    <li> My god i have HORRIBLE resisting skin that hates everything that i put on it! But this stuff is the *&amp;#@! Haha, i loved it! One time in the tanning bed for 7 minutes and i have a very nice shimmering, glowy, beautiful tone. About 5 uses after, dramatic! If you want an awesomely beautiful tan...buy this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this after experimenting successfully w/ Monarchy 7x and Black and Tan 75x.  This bronzer looks darker than B&amp;T when it goes on; however, I didn&#x27;t notice that I tanned darker.  I really like this and would buy it again IF B&amp;T was no longer available.  As far as my tan it was the same as B&amp;T, but B&amp;T wins out because it smells better on your skin.</li>
    <li> you are not going to hit a tanning salon and find a price like this. i love this stuff he gives u a nice brown tan. smells good.</li>
    <li> awesome lotion for anyone that seems to turn orange like me. i have no problems with this lotion . very deep brown color. natural looking tan</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion doesnt leave any streaks and goes on great! smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;great selller and products high recommend</li>
    <li> It is a little watery but makes your skin silky smooth and seems to be helping my tan nicely. Smells great and was a great price with very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I  was a little hesitant buying a lotion older in year but I&#x27;m glad I did. I actually really like this lotion. I noticed a difference In my skin color just after the first time I used it. I do not find this lotion to leave streaks or have a dark bronze look when coming out the bottle. The smell is good, kinda reminds me of a men cologne though. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I recently tried this one and it is a very good lotion but after using it every day it did start to turn my hands orange although I washed my hands when finished. It did give me that bronzed look but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend everyday...maybe 3x a week is sufficient. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this purchase because I had used a friend&#x27;s &#x27;Black Storm 60x Bronzer&#x27; and it worked wonderfully. So I wanted to get my own. I discovered the &#x27;Solid Black 100x Bronzer&#x27; so i thought, &amp;#34;Yeah, the bronzer the better&amp;#34;. The seller shipped it fast and I was pleased with how the transaction went. But I went to use the product and tanned my regular time of 20 minutes, and about an hour later I had these red blistering bumps all over my legs and chest. The next morning they were gone and so was the itch and burn but I didn&#x27;t want to experience that again. I&#x27;ve seen great reviews on this product, so maybe it is just my skin. So I would definitely proceed with caution to those who have sensitive skin. Stick with the &#x27;Black Storm&#x27; that is what I plan to do.</li>
    <li> This bronzer is amazing! I am usually very pale and this stuff got me to the color I wanted very fast!</li>
    <li> THis product is the best!!!!!!!!i ordered it and shipped it to UK as my folks were there - just wish i could purchase it in South Africa - import duty is so expensive and almost double the cost.  But its really a great product</li>
    <li> Is a great product. Was impressed with the cost as I have been paying way more. Noticed a difference the first time of use.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! It works wonders, I have always been able to tan well but this just gives that extra boost! I recently re-ordered some because mine got stolen out of my car, so obviously someone else loves it too!!</li>
    <li> So tan gurl! Thats how I feel when I wear this... GUUUUUUUURL!</li>
    <li> Best Tanning lotion yet</li>
    <li> This lotion has given me great results. The broner provides an instant color boost while giving a rich, lasting tan. A few reviews said that it dyes their hands but I haven&#x27;t had any problems. I put regular lotion on my hands before aplying the product just to be cautious, but now I just put it on without the lotion buffer. Nice, silky texture.</li>
    <li> Deep dark results in only 3 tanning sessions.  Non-greasy feel and fresh smelling.  I generally tan rather easily and this gave me a great boost with an immediate hint of color.  Nice golden brown, not that fake orangey color.  My new favorite!</li>
    <li> Great lotion doesn&#x27;t compare to designer skin though</li>
    <li> This smells great! Love the tan I get from using this lotion. It works so great that even my friends are asking me if they can use some. One of my favorites.</li>
    <li> decent product. the bronzers give a pretty dark color, so be careful to wipe hands!</li>
    <li> It gives a nice overall color but not a noticeable difference. Doesn&#x27;t tan as quickly as most other bronzers I&#x27;ve Used. I honestly would much rather have Australian Gold Going Gaga bronzing lotion. Its so much better and you notice a difference immediately. I will definitely stick with Australian Gold.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to apply, smells good and gives me the effect I want. I am very pale skinned and with this application and a tanning session my skin tone takes on a almost golden color.</li>
    <li> It did start to slowly make my skin turn orange ish after a few uses. I wish, for that reason, I hadn&#x27;t spend my money on it.</li>
    <li> This product works so well! I tan at Planet Fitness, so their beds are just average, but this lotion definitely enhances the end result!</li>
    <li> The scent is very nice, not so overwhelming.  It is easy to apply and does not leave your skin sticky</li>
    <li> Its okay, I still have the lotion but I don&#x27;t use it anymore. The smell smells great in the bottle, smelled like perfume, But after I had it on I smelled so gross. But it tans you good. Make sure you wash your hands after you apply it on sometimes it would make you orange between your fingers!</li>
    <li> The product work really good, but has a gross smell after done tanning.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion ever. Much better price then at the taning salon.</li>
    <li> Turns your skin orange if you don&#x27;t get it all off your fingers, and gets streaks on your skin if you don&#x27;t get it rubbed in all the way.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant in buying a tanning lotion with such an intense bronzer but this is, by far, a wonderful product. You have to apply it VERY well or you will get streaks, but the tan is very natural looking if applied right! You will get dark very quickly! I ended up going on just a level 1 bed three days per week and after three weeks, I reached the same intensity of tan that took me two months with a different product on a level 3 bed. Def a good buy! I&#x27;m still relatively new to tanning and I would recommend this product! :)</li>
    <li> Love Solid Black 100x tanning lotion. I&#x27;ve used it for indoor tanning as well as outdoor and it works wonders. I&#x27;ve always gotten blotchy and had to wear sunscreen or lotion of some sort- which in turns prevents me from tanning. However, this lotion has solved that problem. It keeps my skin moisturized, allows me to tan beautifully, and gives me a little boost of color with the bronzer!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought it from here it excellent price , used it already few. It&#x27;s good for light skin people &amp; not for dark skin like mines.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m already very tan and after I use it , I didn&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m getting tan or keep my color.&lt;br /&gt;But its ok for the price I paid .&lt;br /&gt;Good only for light skin !!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t understand why some people are giving this a bad review, I love it so far!!! Make sure you rub in well &amp; evenly or you&#x27;ll get streaks. Also wipe your hands with baby wipes or it will leave them orange. Other than that it&#x27;s a great product for a great price!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the 50x version of this lotion about a month ago and have really liked it. It did make me noticeably darker every time I used it and kept me dark until about 7-10 days of not tanning. I decided to try the 100x version because I don&#x27;t have the opportunity to go tanning more than 1-2x per week, and therefore I haven&#x27;t been getting as dark as I&#x27;d like to be. I have used this lotion twice and don&#x27;t notice a difference between it and the 50x as far as how dark I&#x27;ve gotten. It doesn&#x27;t really have a typical tanning lotion smell- it smells like fake spray on tan (I personally cannot stand that smell). It does turn your skin a yellow/orange tone and it will stain your hands if you don&#x27;t wash them right away. Even after washing mine I woke up with yellow finger nails/knuckles the next morning. It is also the first lotion I&#x27;ve tried that leaves streaks if you don&#x27;t rub it in perfectly. I would recommend trying the 50x version over this one.</li>
    <li> This product works great I love it and it smells fantastic. Just make sure you rub it in really really good. It has a tendency to leave streaks.</li>
    <li> Smells good until u tan definitely gets u dark..but make sure u wash ur hands it does make them orange..but overall good product.</li>
    <li> This lotion provides good color and is well worth the money.... but warning, it will streak your hands, body and clothes...... so be careful to wash your hands and rub lotion in very good when applying. I would not recommend wearing light colored clothing immediately after tanning because it may rub off a bit.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is the best I&#x27;ve used so far, it makes me pretty dark. I also like how silky it is, it isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
    <li> It works okay. It smells good. I am glad I got it on here, since its $100+ at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this lotion! I do not like to tan a lot, using this lotion helps me tan faster and keep the tan longer. No streaking!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion. Great for indoor tanning. Within a week of using this lotion I was noticing how dark I was getting. I recommend this lotion to anyone who tans regularly.</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past, for my skin type I can have a tan in as little as 2 sessions  :)  I could not believe the turn around time!!  I want to say it came the next day.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more than 2 or 3 days at the most.  I love not having to wait!  I would recommend this item to my friends.  Also loved not having to pay for shipping........... bonus&lt;br /&gt;!!!</li>
    <li> love this wont use any other ever again! would tell everyone this is the one the one that works the best</li>
    <li> It works really well gives a great even tan. Good rich color! It makes your skin look smooth and evenly tanned</li>
    <li> read  all  the  reviews  thought I  was  getting a  good  product I  have  had  no  change  in  color  since I  bought it I  ran  every  other  day I  already  had a  good  tan  but it  hasn&#x27;t  changed  at  all  since I  started  using it( about a  month)  the  shipper  was  the  best  thing  about it,  got it  in 2  days  from  ordering it  but  not  happy  at  all  with  no  results</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this lotion.  I seen results after the first use.  After a month of tanning, I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use nothing else.  I get dark in just a few visits and it will last a very long time!</li>
    <li> very good product love the results would tell my friends about it.would order solid black again love using it great.</li>
    <li> Great bronzer, very affordable! The smell is addicting. Make sure you wipe your palms off though or it will stain them.</li>
    <li> A friend let me use hers once and I was hooked!  I get great color with this product and it&#x27;s so much less expensive than buying the salon stuff</li>
    <li> I liked it and used it until it was gone...but I liked the Black and Tan much, much, much better!</li>
    <li> the product never got tan at ALL. threw away and found a better product called Bella soleil and that got me really tan.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for years and love dark bronzer in my lotion. This is the best I have every bought! I love this lotion and don&#x27;t even bother looking for others anymore. My tanning salon sells it for$140.00 a bottle and can&#x27;t keep it on the shelves!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for a while but I started with very fair skin. I bought this product in hopes of getting dark as fast as possible... big mistake. I turned pretty orange on some parts of my body that hadn&#x27;t gotten as tan as other parts and had some noticeable streaking on my legs. I do not recommend this if you are fair, but on the other hand if you are already pretty dark and have hit a plague, this actually might be a good product. Places like my stomach that tan much faster and were darker when I started using this lotion did not turn orange at all.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product it was completely fine and safe. I have no complaints about the seller.</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer. Best buy for your buck by far. Does not even smell as bad as most.</li>
    <li> good price good product&lt;br /&gt;almost done with this product and will purchase more in the near future thanks so much</li>
    <li> I got this and tryed it and loved it...I even orderd more...I used gloves when putting it on that helps.</li>
    <li> this product doesn&#x27;t or hasn&#x27;t given me any results. not a fan, leave a yellow tint on my skin and a funky smell.</li>
    <li> Greatest lotion ever! Nice smell, good consistency, try it, you will like it. 💞💞</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. With my work schedule I don&#x27;t get in the tanning bed as much as I would like, but this lotion helps me keep my color... with very little fade. Once this bottle is empty, I WILL buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion.  Works great!  Will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion twice now and I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;ve gotten darker! I use my family&#x27;s tanning bed (because it&#x27;s free lol) and I got a really good base tan on my stomach and back from using the European Gold 200XX Flash Black for 3 days straight (purchased at Wal-Mart for $10) and my sister is so dark so I asked what lotion she used and she said this one. So I ordered it right away and I am noticing a difference in my color! It&#x27;s a really great price though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;8 days later of continuous use and I am TANNNNN!!!! I have gotten so many compliments on how fast I have gotten dark! Normally it&#x27;s takes a month before I have ever gotten to this color and that is with laying the max in a super bed! I&#x27;m laying 14 minutes in a regular bed and am so golden bronze it&#x27;s crazy!! But beware! I learned the hard way by not wiping all the lotion off my hands that it will turn your hands/wrists/fingers orange as crap! I still love this stuff and will definitely order more in a few weeks!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. Love this product. Smells fantastic. It produces a great tan. I would recommend it to others. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been tanning for several years and have gotten my best results using Solid Black. I highly recommend it to serious tanners like myself. The only con is that it leaves your palms discolored if you do not wipe them off before getting in the bed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this tanning lotion!!! I have tried so many different ones and this one is by far the BEST lotion I ever had!!! It got me dark super quick and it hasn&#x27;t turned my hands orange. If you purchase this lotion you will NOT be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I went tanning using this lotion a week before our trip (about 4 days total) to California for Spring Break and this got me super dark fast! Just what I needed for the price!</li>
    <li> This smells like self tanner and acts like self tanner. I usually use Paint It Black by the same company and never have had a problem. I ordered this one on accident and it&#x27;s horrible. If you don&#x27;t rub it in VERY well it leaves dark spots and streaks. I just can&#x27;t get over the smell...they should sell this as a self tanner vs. a tanning bed lotion.</li>
    <li> This is my first bad review I&#x27;ve written on Amazon EVER:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously used Black Storm and LOVED it, so I thought I&#x27;d try something different and bought this. After reading the reviews, I was aware it had the potential to streak, so I was extra careful to blend it evenly. I still ended up with VERY dark VERY noticeable streaks. I spent my morning buffing away with a tan evening pad but the streaks are too defined and too dark for it to really help. My arms/hands now looks like I have a severe skin disorder and my fiance/ coworkers have been giving me crap about it all day *Sigh*</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the texture. Be sure to rub it in enough or you will be streaky. I would purchase this lotion again, I am really dark and only tanned 3 times.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty Good product for the cost does turn your  skin a little orange and blotchy but overall. A decent lotion</li>
    <li> used three times and tan is looking great already!</li>
    <li> I have used a ton of tanning lotions this one is not going to make you black if you don&#x27;t tan easily. I have pretty white skin with golden undertones and I felt the self tanner in this pulled too much yellow rather than the green base I prefer. Every skin tone is going to react differently. It has a very moderate moisturizing quality if you have dry skin, you will want to moisturize again post tanning to keep your skin smooth and firm.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference with the use of the product.  This is also probably one of the worst products I have smelled after use.  I prefer the Wal-mart brand of hawiian tropic over this product for smell and performance, as a last resort</li>
    <li> Wow I have tanned for years this lotion hands down is the best. I am so much darker after one session and my skin feels great. The price was cheap so I was not sure... I am so glad I bought this and can&#x27;t wait to use it again. Btw smells great too will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and will very likely continue to use it. Its smooth, gives me just the right glow and doesn&#x27;t stink after I tan. It&#x27;s amazing for the price!</li>
    <li> All the reviews on this prodcut kind of scared me but I was going to take a chance anyway because I was desperate for a tan. I am so glad i ordered it! After the first use i could already tell a diffrence and now i have only used it twice and i am tanner than i have ever been!!! and i definetly dont have any streaks anywhere...just wipe your hands after application or it will leave color in between your fingers but all my other lotions did that too. I will definetly only be using this lotion from now on!!!!! ANd it is not an orange color i look like i have a normal tan.</li>
    <li> Good indoor tanning lotion.  It was a little surprising when I first used it, as the lotion is gray and very thin.  The product works well.</li>
    <li> Tried it several times. I don&#x27;t believe it is legit. No apparent bronzer inside. I see no bronzing, no color after tanning, just a burnt smell. I wipe my hands clean with a wet wipe after tanning and absolutely nothing transfers onto the wipe. You gotta think, I purchased it for $13 and change...just can&#x27;t be legit. I also tan with Anything Goes that I bought at the tanning salon, and I see color after tanning, I wipe my hands and there is transference onto the wipe. Buyer beware. Save your $.</li>
    <li> The lotion itself has a great smell... It doesn&#x27;t even have the bad after tan smell. One con to the lotion is that you really need to make sure the you rub it in extremely well or you will have dark streaks.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Quickest and darkest response I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a lotion. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the product and the price, much cheaper and the same quality that the local tanning saloons sell the same product for. The item showed up earlier than estimated. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is great tanning lotion.  It has been working great for me - I get quick color that lasts and it doesn&#x27;t turn my skin all orange like other lotions that I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> This lotion is okay but it is VERY drying. If I use it more than a couple times a week my skin feels like leather. Not my fave.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is great. I thought it had a nice smell and left my skin nice and soft after using it.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy thanks.</li>
    <li> nice golden broze tan</li>
    <li> noticed a difference almost instantly. The bronzer gives your skin a natural glow as if you just got back from the beach. I don&#x27;t like lotions that are super sweet smelling...this lotion has a very fragrance that&#x27;s subtle and not too strong. Can&#x27;t beat the price either!!</li>
    <li> Can be a little streaky but overall color looks good. Product shipped instantly.  I would order it again. Good price as well.</li>
    <li> I just didn&#x27;t see results with this lotion. I purchased it for the price but seriously regret it now for I had to purchase another tanning bed lotion. I never write bad reviews but felt the need to warn people to not waste their hard earn money on this one.</li>
    <li> I have been an on/off tanning salon user for the last 10 years.  This lotion by far is my favorite!  So glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> Bronzer!!! love that it came so fast and This is my 3rd time buying so much better then the stuff they sell at salon and cost is 1/4 of what they want. Buy it</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Have me am awese tan that I get compliments about daily. Love the scent. Will most diff buy again.</li>
    <li> This lotion gives you a nice tan! I just wish that I smelled a little better.</li>
    <li> Left streaks, the smell is horrible and did not notice a difference after tanning.  Seems to be a cheap version of another lotion.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice and I have brown stains on my fingers and wrists from the lotion. It smells good though.</li>
    <li> I always try new lotions but I would definitely order this again. Some people said it left streaks, not true. It gave good color and worked right away. I wish it had very good smell but it is just okay. Keeps my skin tanner and I do not have to tan every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of writing reviews but I know how helpful they can be so I wanted to share my thoughts on this product. It works well, the bronzer in the lotion is not to obnoxious so it doesn&#x27;t turn you orange. I was at a nice tan by week 2 of going to the tanning salon and I had only&lt;br /&gt; been going about 3 times a week. I started going even more and am brown now. I am naturally very pale.&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It works really well and has a great scent. Yes, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty good tan and this still turn me a little orange. I do like the smell, but am generally not too impressed with it.</li>
    <li> God this stuff is really runny...  smells horrible....  gives blotchy appearance on my legs and I have been tanning forever so i know how to rub in my lotion...  never buying again</li>
    <li> great product and seller</li>
    <li> I used to use the 50x darker from the same brand, and I could tell my skin was just kind of getting used to the lotion.. so I purchased this, it works great! I was darker than I normally am, and stayed dark. Just make sure to shake the bottle so that the bronzer doesn&#x27;t settle and whatnot -- but I have not had a bad experience with  this product whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion. Has bronzer in it, be careful about applying evenly or it will leave you streaky!</li>
    <li> I have bought product from this company before and loved it, I am very fair skinned and all of their lotions give me a rich dark tan and they are soo much cheaper than designer skin , my previous love, these lotion work every bit as well at a fraction of the price ! I have now tried several in the millennium line and each one has absolutely lived up to it&#x27;s description, great color , great fragrance goes on smooth and even, my only advice is to wash hands after you apply the bronzers will turn palms dark brown !&lt;br /&gt;I highly endorse these lotions !</li>
    <li> Okay product have bought better but also it costed more then this. You pay for what you get.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this tanning lotion does not have a smell to it. However, this product does not get me as dark as it says it will. I&#x27;ve used other tanning lotions by other companies that have a lesser amount of bronzers in it and I get darker. I probably will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It didn&#x27;t leave my hands orange and slimy and it did really help to make me a bit tanner faster.</li>
    <li> Salon quality, smells good.</li>
    <li> Smell is good. I&#x27;m just used to another brand. I gave this one a go as it was cheaper. It slightly had a more orange appearance rather than the rich bronze color most of us are going for.</li>
    <li> This is good for beginners, but that&#x27;s about it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone trying to break a tanning plateau or get REALLY dark.</li>
    <li> great lotion...much cheaper than salon prices...wish i would have bought years ago...</li>
    <li> I tan fairly easily but have not gone to the tanning bed in a few weeks.  I have only used this lotion twice and I&#x27;m already golden brown. Love it!</li>
    <li> Works just as promised.  Arrived on time.  Great product.  Will reorder.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Product works really well. I am light skinned.  Usually takes a couple of weeks to see results. Went and tanned for 2 days and couldn&#x27;t believe the results. Everyone asked when I started tanning again I said 2 days ago. So now I go twice a week. Love it</li>
    <li> Works great &amp; could see color in a couple of sessions.</li>
    <li> I used to be a white boy. Not anymore!</li>
    <li> I got this lotion for my girl and it&#x27;s great she loves it and I love her tanning.</li>
    <li> Love this product, delivery was also fast and color lasts so well that I now only tan 2 days a week</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Glides on easily, great bronzer.</li>
    <li> love it saved 100 from store price</li>
    <li> excellent lotion smooth no streaking</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice and I am already pretty tan i just needed a little boost and after the first use my friends and boyfriend noticed right away. Definately worth the money and it goes on so easy.</li>
    <li> I liked everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;the delivery was on time.&lt;br /&gt;it gets me very dark after 2-3 times.&lt;br /&gt;make sure to take off the bronzer off your hands bc it stains.</li>
    <li> Great smelling product, easy to use bottle, give nice dark color, tan looks real as if you came from the beach awesome price</li>
    <li> This has worked great with my tanning at the tanning bed.I now have a dark tan.Thanks  so very very much</li>
    <li> i got really dark using this lotion! it really works well! i would recommend to anyone that tans often and wants to get dark quick! tan lasts longer with this lotion!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that great of a tanning lotion &amp; I didn&#x27;t like that it stains your skin with the bronzer.</li>
    <li> This works so well! The only thing just like any other bronzer, you need to make sure that you&#x27;re rubbing it evenly across the skin. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll have smear marks just like a spray tan. After you let it sit for at least a few hours, you get darker &amp; darker... but then shower cuz you&#x27;ll stank.</li>
    <li> I bought this online a couple days ago and ive used it 2-3 times already and it streaks if you dont rub it in really good and leaves your hands orange if you do not wash your hands after you apply the lotion. Overall i am very dark already after only using it 2 or 3 times. The only reason i gave it 3 stars was because of the streaking and orange hands.</li>
    <li> Smells good works great used 2 weeks n I&#x27;m getting so tan. Ppl were seeing results from just 4 visits.</li>
    <li> I usually buy Bombshell in the candy stripe bottle but started to get tired of the tingle feeling it gives so i took a chance and bought this and its amazing!! it doesnt leave a greasy feel and doesnt smell awful... great product for the $ and i will for sure re order when i run out!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty tan and I have been using it a month now. I love it and works great only down fall is it leaves your skin after tanning smelling like fake tan smell but that washes off and its not as over powering as real fake tanners. But if you don&#x27;t wash it off your hands after they do slightly get a Cheeto stain lol but its very very light I don&#x27;t wash my hands after usually and if you look close they have a funny yellowish tinge to them but its not noticeable. I also use it on my face and I haven&#x27;t had any problems yet I get a pimple or two every once and awhile but I don&#x27;t think its the tanning lotion. Overall I love this product and would buy again I just think I want to try some others they have first just to mix it up</li>
    <li> I have tried many lotions with bronzers, this is my favorite one so far. I have an amazingly beautiful golden brown tan and I know that this lotion has helped me achieve it much more quickly than without...it smells good, my skin feels so soft. It is truly awesome!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally tan in the tanning bed, this year is actually my first time in the beds and this lotion has been great! I have been using it for 4 weeks now and I have never been so dark in my life and its not even Spring yet. Plus the lotion smells awesome! GREAT BUY!</li>
    <li> I chose this from the great reviews of others. Great lotion that I will be purchasing from now on. Just received the lotion in the mail opened and used it, now I&#x27;m a shade darker. I made sure to read the bottle since I read the bad reviews and it states on the back of the bottle To Use: Apply liberally prior to tanning. Which means you don&#x27;t need much a little goes a long way. As long as you apply it evenly and rub it in till no more lotion is sitting on your skin just like every other lotion out on the market, you wont have streaks! Also, it states on the bottle to wash hands THOROUGHLY after applying! So you NEED to wash them PRIOR to getting in the TANNING BED! If you let it set on your skin for 6 or so hours after tanning,you can start to see slight orange but once you take your shower it goes away.Wonderful product which everyone should buy for the nice golden brown tan it gives you especially after one use. I have my own tanning bed been using all sorts of different lotions and this one works the best with the fastest results that I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;_UP DATE_&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using this for a little over a month. I only use this product once a week and another for the other two days. This is because when I used this every other day I started to notice that only on my palms was a small tint of orange/yellow. I scrub my palms right after applying every time and see the dark lotion going down the drain. I do let it stay on  the rest of my skin for 6 hours or so afterwards not sure if that is why I&#x27;m getting those results from touching the rest of my body which still has lotion on, but the dies are definitely strong in it. After tanning I do smell a peculiar burnt smell(not sure what type of burnt)but it&#x27;s strange. Besides the palm thing and get past stinking for a few hours I still enjoy the instant n lasting tan you get out of this lotion!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome lotion and I would recommend it to anyone!  I like that it does not stink after use.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best bronzer I have ever used!! Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> This lotion has accelerated my tan, but is staining my palms orange after continued use. I also prefer the smell of other lotions to this one.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t show up on time was about three months late and had no warning for this was very disappointed in this</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin orange. Never had a tanning lotion for indoor tanning turn me orange. Threw it away. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Millenium products several times from Amazon now and will continue to do so. The tanning lotions are great, priced right, and speedy delivery. None of them have strong odors, however my husband said this one is a bit perfumish. Solid Black also has a touch of self tanner in it, so be careful when you apply it. It hasn&#x27;t stained my hands or clothes, but did collect around my toes and left steaks- alcohol will lift most of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually purchased this item elsewhere and I loved it. Seeing the great deal Amazon had on it I just had to purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;When I received the lotion I was so upset because it seemed to be a knock off. It was really thin and didn&#x27;t rub in like the lotion I had purchased from the tanning salon. It also didn&#x27;t bronze my skin at all!</li>
    <li> All of the reviews sounded great.  I was excited to try the product, but was soon disappointed.  I have been using it a week and can&#x27;t tell any difference.  Maybe it is just my skin type.  I may be as dark as I am capable of getting.  It does smell good and feel good on my skin.  I am thankful that I bought this item on Amazon and not in the salon......it was $68 there and WAY cheaper here.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best for the price aswell as it turns you very dark even after the first lay in the tanning</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite tanning lotion so far!</li>
    <li> This lotion worked great. Got a great tan and regardless of other comments I thought it smelled good for a tanning lotion</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion &amp; the smell of it too! If used on a consistent basis this would really make a good tanning lotion. It is better than the pink JWOWW lotion that I had.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!! Got nice and dark with just a few uses. Smells good too!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is WONDERFUL!!! I consider myself a lotion pro..I have designer skin, snooki, jwow..etc. This has by far given me the fastest color of the lotions I have used. Before you tan it smells like a mild perfume, after it smells nutty. I do not smell the after tan scent like most. This lotion is excellent and for the price, unbelievable! Will by buying more.</li>
    <li> It works, smells decent, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Also, anything to avoid the pushy sales girls at the salon! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> love this lotion! great bronzers</li>
    <li> Of course the tanning salon I go to, the price for lotion is on the high side. After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this, cannot beat the price, especially with the free shipping. I just received the lotion, so only tried once when writing this review. It has a nice scent compared to other lotions I have tried which is a plus, the lotion is not greasy and after tanning I noticed I already had color ! I think this type is a keeper !</li>
    <li> I have used this for a while and on of the better tanning products on the market. it really worke good for ne.  recommend it highly...</li>
    <li> My favorite, I think it&#x27;s real but I don&#x27;t know how to tell. I think I&#x27;m tanner with this one</li>
    <li> Read the reviews prior to buying and some say it streaks some say it doesn&#x27;t. It def did on both me and my boyfriend. Would not recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I don&#x27;t see it working any faster than others necessarily because I tan pretty easily but it has never turned my body orange, just hands after application if I&#x27;m not careful! So just make sure to wipe your hands of as soon as you put the lotion on/wash your hands as soon as you finish tanning or your hands could be slightly tented orange.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good and it works!,,, Nice smell and you tan fast!! Very effective and fast acting. Great product ever!</li>
    <li> The tanning lotion wasn&#x27;t great at all. It&#x27;s not like other lotions where it actually helps you tan, it washed off after I showered along with my tan..I would NOT recommend this , at all!</li>
    <li> Forget spending those high prices in tanning salons.  This product works just as good as the $50+ brands.  I bought some more when I ran out the first time.</li>
    <li> I am extremely fair skinned, i believe mostly because i am indoors a lot of the time, but i used this today in my backyard for about 2 hours and i got a nice little base tan. Would purchase again. Nice smell and texture</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I purchased the Paint it Black 50X which would be a step down from Solid Black 100X and it had little to no effect as far as tanning goes.  Solid Black 100X gave me color the first day, and I do not tan easily, I&#x27;m a fair Irish girl. The only reason I made an attempt to take it down a notch to the Paint it Black 50X is around my wrists and ankles the tan would look funny, it kinda made my wrists look dirty.  BUT I didn&#x27;t give up, when applying it now i take extra time to put it on evenly and lay my wrists flat in the tanning bed  and problem solved.  It took some time to figure it out, but i am 100% happy with this product, on my second bottle already.</li>
    <li> It was shipped quickly and it was not altered or watered down. It works very good.</li>
    <li> I got this product because I was almost out of Black Storm, which I really liked. I thought this one would give me the same nice glow as Black Storm but maybe in less time because it was supposed to be stronger.First off, you should definetly treat this like a self tanner because it will dry streaky if you are just slathering it on carelessly, but as long as you take the time to rub it in evenly you should be fine, and wash your hands because they will look orange after you put this on, something I never had to worry about with Black Storm.  I didn&#x27;t get the same lovely brown glow that I was expecting either, I wouldn&#x27;t say it was orange, but it looked a little bit fake.  I sat in the sun like I did with Black Storm(not in a sun bed) so maybe it would have given me a different result if I was in a sun bed. It smells nice and it did work very quickly and the color that I got from it did last a very long time but overall Im happier with Black Storm and I will be repurchasing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tanning bed addict and have tried so many tanning products.  I love this product, and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like this, I use switch from the hot tingle to this.  It all depends on how I feel or how hot it is outside.</li>
    <li> A couple of summers ago I walked into the tanning salon just to see how much it cost. They roped me in saying if I bought a lotion I got a month of free tanning. So I did. I got the cheapest bottle I could get which was $45 for a bottle of Swedish beauty something or another. I absolutely hated that lotion. It left me streaky orange. I took my dogs to the river &amp; my husband was picking on me cause I literally had streaks down my legs, where the color was running off me. Yuck!! Anyway I asked them about other lotions. Cheapest they had was the $45 bottle. Next bottle up was $60. Yeah no!! I was not gonna pay that much for a bottle I said kinda out loud but didnt mean to \\&quot;I&#x27;ll check out what amazon has.\\&quot; Oops wrong words. I got this long huge speach on how I should not order from amazon cause people will buy a bottle of lotion use it &amp; then fill it with some cheap stuff &amp; you don&#x27;t know what your gonna get yada yada yada...! My though was what ever!! You just want me to buy your high dollar bottles of lotion &amp; I refuse to do it!! So I bought this lotion!! I had this lotion along with the lotion I bought from there in my bag. I went in using this lotion. (I had their lotion just incase I got questioned lol). The very first time I used this lotion I saw results the very same night!! I was not orange. I was actually tan. After doing this for a couple of days I got darker &amp; darker. Even my husband saw results. I again took the dogs to the river. No runs!! The smell is ok (but smelled way better then the stuff they sold me) &amp; for the price... WAY better!! My husband just bought me a tanning bed for my birthday. My bottle is almost gone, &amp; I do plan on buying this again!! I may not be a pro tanner but I will get there lol!</li>
    <li> I really love this tanning lotion and I will be buying it again very soon! I got SO dark after just two 10 minute tanning sessions in a low pressure bed!!! I had pretty light skin and it did not turn me orange at all! Most people complained about the smell but that is not true, this lotion smells lovely before AND after tanning! It is a great moisturizer also. It came 4 days earlier than the earliest arrival date which was great! I love this product and will be using it all summer!</li>
    <li> Best Ever tanning bed lotion that doesn&#x27;t cost me an arm and a leg.  This stuff is amazing and if you are looking for a good lotion, I suggest you get this!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I am a blonde and if it was going to streak orange on anybody, it would be me. I have a great tan with it and people even ask me what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing because I smell really nice and I tell them I am not wearing perfume, it&#x27;s my tanning lotion. AND the price is AWESOME!!!!!</li>
    <li> Iam a freckled redhead who had a hard time tanning.  this tanning lotion is the best I&#x27;ve used this far and I saw results after 3 tans! So worth it!</li>
    <li> Bought a bottle for my son, he got so dark using this that I went and bought a bottle for myself, I can&#x27;t believe that i already seem darker after 2 times tanning .</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion for the money in my opinion!  I&#x27;ve tried several more expensive ones but I always come back to this one</li>
    <li> Awesome color! Got here fast. Good smell, better than most. Authentic.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite lotions! And possibly one of the most affordable. Gave me GREAT color that went pretty deep. Came really quick, too. When it runs out I&#x27;m deff getting again!</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome.  I am absolutely thrilled with this lotion!!  I am able to get awesome color in a short amount of time!!</li>
    <li> lotion seems watery hard to rub in turned  me and my hands orange has an after tan smell wouldnt recommend</li>
    <li> Fantastic Results...  what I liked the most was that it wasnt tacky, it waslike puting on an after bath lotion  that just dissapeared into the skin. It gave fantastic color right away. I got sooo many compliments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude and I occasionally use a tanning bed just to keep my tan consistent because I work a lot during the days. It sucks to build up a nice tan outdoors and then lose it because you can&#x27;t get outside during the day. This cures that problem. I tan moderately and within the first 3 trips, I already had an awesome tan. It smells good, not too strong and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling all sticky like other lotions do. It gives you an outdoor-looking tan, not orange. Good price and it&#x27;s a hefty amount which will last me a long time no more than I use a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Stains skin and clothes rather than &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Quick delivery!!! Product was exactly what I ordered. I have used it twice and can already see a difference. I was very pleased with the smell. Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Terrible....it doesn&#x27;t work and I&#x27;m orange and streaked</li>
    <li> This is honestly one of the best tanning lotions I have ever used! And that price?!!? Who can beat that? The smell is not opposing and this leaves your skin super hydrated and supple. The bronzers in this leave you looking bronzed and beautiful in just a matter of days. I have used MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE lotions that cannot compete with this Solid Black lotion. I have told all of my friends about this bad boy and we are all so happy we found this!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a bronzer that darkens after tanning and then streaks &amp; turns orange this is for you!</li>
    <li> This works wonders in the tanning bed for fair skin.  I keep buying this because it has been the best for my husband&#x27;s fair skin.  He has a medical condition that is helped by tanning.  This solution moistens his skin, smells great, doesn&#x27;t irritate, and really does help him get and maintain a very attractive tan.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing!! Have been using this for the past couple years and still love it!</li>
    <li> Came in the mail quick, works great and can&#x27;t beat the price !</li>
    <li> One of the first lotions I ever used. Love it! Dark quickly! Has good smell</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t find a better product for the price....</li>
    <li> Absolutely great product! I noticed a deep richer tan after just two tans. Very satisfied. Worth the price!:)</li>
    <li> I use this lotion at the tanning salon for 12 min in a medium bed and it only takes 2 days to be dark. Although I do have olive skin, but this is better than any of the lotions that they sell at the salons which are around $80! All the bad reviews on here are not true; how could it leave your hands orange if it comes out light brown? And the smell.....smells like all other tanning lotion. It also doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreen in it and I still didn&#x27;t burn at all!!! I can&#x27;t express how amazing this product is! I&#x27;ve already recommended it to all my friends and family and they are amazed at my results(I put a sticker on my hip in the same spot both times and it&#x27;s a huge difference! Best way to tell how well you tanned)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it tanned as well as other lotions, but that is not the worst con.  This lotion smells like pee. My daughter (11) said, mom you smell like pee. My other daughter (3) said, mom I didn&#x27;t pee my pants I really didn&#x27;t but I can smell pee. I had just returned from the tanner. I do not recommend this lotion at all.</li>
    <li> Nice product, arrived quickly.  Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Great product! I never thought lotions made too much difference until I tried this one. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I would consider myself pretty fair-skinned, but can get a tan and keep it quite easily. This product gives me a good color (no orange glow) and I feel like my tan sticks around for an exceptional amount of time. I&#x27;m very thrilled with this lotion and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Smells great. Works great.</li>
    <li> Just be carefull or you will get so dark it will give your skin an orange tint if used too much.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite, wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for very fair skin, just doesn&#x27;t get you very far.</li>
    <li> Does not leave you orange!</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time today.  No streaks or orange here.  I noticed I could not stay in the tanning bed the entire time of 20 minutes like I usually do.  I simply got too hot and sweaty at about the 15 minute mark and had to get out.  Yes, it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the lotions sold in tanning salons. I was very disappointed as this product cost simularly to those sold there,</li>
    <li> The product worked well.</li>
    <li> Simply the best tanning lotion I have used.  I have used it both indoor and outdoor.  I think you get better bronzing with this once compared to paint it black, obsidian, luminary, black, black and tan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting so dark with this lotion. Took a good week of everyday tanning to see results, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Basically, this just works. Great indoor tanning lotion. The scent is not overpowering, very mild and leaves your skin with a smooth feel. I&#x27;m a guy so I don&#x27;t want any flowery smelling stuff. Way cheaper to order it here than pay 3x as much at the salon.</li>
    <li> It makes you dark quickly because it has a bronzer.  You will smell like a self tanner for a day, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews on tanning lotion because I always thought they were all the same until I used Solid Black Bronzer.  This lotion doesnt leave you streaky, sticky, or with a funky orange color.  Absolutely love this lotion!!</li>
    <li> this lotion gets me really dark but you have to make sure to apply it evenly, it streaks pretty easily.</li>
    <li> I thought I liked this product--it smells good, it was reasonably priced. Well, I&#x27;ve used it a few times and I have orange, self-tanner blotches ALL OVER my legs!! I didn&#x27;t realize the &amp;#34;extreme bronzers&amp;#34; meant orange self-tanner...I guess that was my own mistake. When you&#x27;re getting ready to go into the tanning bed, you generally don&#x27;t have a lot of time to make sure the lotion is evenly distributed all over your body. Well, I&#x27;ve seen what happens if you don&#x27;t make sure this lotion is rubbed in perfectly!! Definitely returning it for a different lotion.</li>
    <li> I am not an avid tanner... in fact, I just established my FIRST base tan (and I am 28 years old). After just TWO uses I can tell this product REALLY works. I actually have a tan now... and more than just a base tan! It somehow really makes the tanning bed work more and the light bronzers leave the skin soft, looking dewy, and bronzed. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Been using this product since december 2012. Before using this product I used &amp;#34;paint it black&amp;#34;. Solid Black has a good smell &amp; it leaves your skin feeling soft</li>
    <li> so much cheaper than salon price and a great product</li>
    <li> I like the lotion. It smells good and gave me a nice brown tan instead of making me look orange. I also like that Millenium sent it so quickly.</li>
    <li> Quite disappointed with this product.  The color doesn&#x27;t stay too long on your body like some other products I&#x27;ve used.  It also doesn&#x27;t bring that bronze out.</li>
    <li> It smells good and is a really nice bronzer.  You do have to wipe your hands or they do turn orange.  As long as you remember that then you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> love the scent and easy to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you remove rings from hands after applying.</li>
    <li> as promsied! Quick shipping! Works great! This is exactly as advertised and I will buy again, Great price and an awesome product!</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does. Nice dark tan. Just make sure you get it even because the in between of my fingers are super orange right now, as you can kind of see in the picture. I love the smell. Used it for the first time today and I&#x27;m satisfied. The only thing is, it makes you LOOK tan without actually HELPINGS you tan, if that makes sense. It&#x27;s more like a rub on spray tan lol but it looks good. Delivered on time, and it&#x27;s a good size bottle. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> Great smell and works great. Shades darker in two tans and I am fair skinned. Will definitely perchance again when ready.</li>
    <li> This is a great indoor tanning lotion. Smells good, leaves skin soft, tan very quickly. My wife uses this and she got a dark tan with in two weeks, especially since she was really pale (Hadn&#x27;t tanned in 2+ years) She&#x27;s not orange but a very golden tan. She likes it and is on her second bottle now. I like the price :) works out for both of us.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells good! I can tell a noticeable difference when I skip a few days of tanning (so the bronzer has time to fade) then go again...and poof I&#x27;m nice and dark again.</li>
    <li> A lotion with color without the heat. I use this all year and it gives me the color i want</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me, I&#x27;ve only been tanning for a month and not even everyday and I have a deep dark tan. I started out pasty as hell! I would definitely recommend this product , but expect to get burnt once or twice before getting that perfect tan!</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! It is amazing. Everytime I use it I get a full shade darker. Now to be fair this does have a lot of bronzer in it so you MUST apply it evenly, and wash your hands well. But I promise you any avid tanner looking to boost their color this is the product for you. I will be buying this again and again and again.</li>
    <li> No jokes: this product cost 87$ at my tanning salon. This is AMAZING and I always buy it online. It&#x27;s the exact same bottle/cream that I tried in salon. I use this indoor and outdoor and it gives me an AMAZING tan. It makes my skins soooo soft, smells like heaven, does NOT strike, NOT making my skin orange at all. Buy it!</li>
    <li> This is another product I purchased for indoor tanning and it works incredibly well.  Looks like I was away on vacation in a tropical paradise.  Highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT! Smells good in bottle and is just okay after you tan. Nothing bad at all. It really does make you darker definitely not orange.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! I use so many tanning lotions from JWOW to Australian Gold and i have to say this stuff is great for the money! I actually use this more as a lotion for quick color refreshing and i can notice in as long as it takes to fully dry that my tan looks so much more intensified! It doesn&#x27;t have any amazing smell to it but it leaves your skin sooooo SOFT. I would recommend it to anyone. :)</li>
    <li> This lotion is fabulous!!!!! It smells great and it gives u the most beautiful dark bronze skin almost immediately. I was very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced indoor tanning lotion, decent smell, goes on smoothly. Definitely a good tanning lotion for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Added boost for tanning.</li>
    <li> I have used many tanning lotions and paid way more for them.  This works even better than some of the more expensive ones:)</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this product at first because of the bad reviews saying it turned people orange and left streaks.. well.. I did not have this problem. At all! This lotion is great ..especially for the price. If u don&#x27;t tan well and have pale skin.. then I could see why you might get streaky and orange.. that&#x27;s cause you arnt tanning Hon! U don&#x27;t have the skin for it. Stop tanning. This lotion works!</li>
    <li> Gives you a really nice tan.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this lotion because of the price being so low but yet the reviews said it was a good lotion. To my surprise I feel that I got darker from using it. I felt like I had plateud and this lotion helped me get past that plateau. Good price and the quality of the lotion is very good. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Has some fake tan in it that evens tans my bright white skin to a decent color (not orange!). Great price. Pleasant smell. Very good moisturizer. I&#x27;ve bought this twice. So inexpensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright I guess for the price not bad but if u are looking to be really dark not a good choice. My tan doesn&#x27;t last long at all when I use this product it smells okay but when you&#x27;re done tanning it doesn&#x27;t smell that great I personally will never buy this product again but if it worked for u then great!</li>
    <li> IT WAS Put in a box ! was Fine !</li>
    <li> I got a soft bronze tan after two visits. This is da bomb.</li>
    <li> Well with this product it really dont have a good smell but it does work fine.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this product again the over all out come was good. It was&lt;br /&gt;worth the money I spent and I have recommended this product to several people.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love the color I take on from it.  I can&#x27;t use tingle products and standard tanning lotion leaves me blotchy.  The bronzers in this product help greatly to keep all that covered.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery. And awesome product</li>
    <li> In my opinion this is the BEST tanning lotion you can use.&lt;br /&gt;My skin: very fair/pale without tanning. I live in ALASKA. Without tanning I get exposed to almost zero sunlight, and I&#x27;ve only been tanning for about a year. I also have hyper sensitive skin and have to be super careful about what I put on it.&lt;br /&gt;How I tan WITHOUT this product: my face ALWAYS burns, and the rest of me either doesn&#x27;t tan at all or turns reddish. I literally get no &#x27;tan&#x27; whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;How I tan WITH this product: Not only do I NEVER burn anywhere, I tan SO good. I literally get brown. Not orange, a nice dark brown. My legs tan, my arms tan, and my face tans. NO SUNBURN EVER. Just brown! It&#x27;s amazing. Also NEVER breaks me out or irritates my skin, which is saying alot!&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: put it on all over, go tanning, and make sure to wash your hands after or they will get blotchy. I go tanning 1-2 weekly, for 15-20 min in a level 1 or 2 bed (100-120 watt beds). If you don&#x27;t shower right after you tan it&#x27;s even better and your skin will get even browner, but even if you do shower you will still be nice and brown. It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping/price: VERY cheap (15$) and comes VERY quickly. It comes within 2 days, and a bottle last me quite awhile. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and I&#x27;ve been using it for a year.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very very happy. I have experimented somewhat with pricier tanning lotions but this one is still by far the best. If it can make me, a pale Alaskan girl, tan so good, I&#x27;m sure it could work for anyone. Among my friends I&#x27;m known as a &#x27;tanning expert&#x27; if you will, and I often get asked what to use, and I always recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is awesome for indoor tanning! I love it! great tanning product I suggest you buy it and try it.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it and said it works great. Helps her tan much faster...Would recommend to anyone that goes to a tanning salon</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! Smells great too</li>
    <li> I bought this for an ex girlfriend who uses a tanning bed. She likes it. If you do buy this stuff shop it on-line, prices are worth it.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product the first few times I used it. I immediately noticed more bronzed skin after the first use in the tanning bed. The first 3 times I used it there was no streaking, and my color was even and golden. But the 4th time I used it, there were little blotches all my one are and some on my leg and in between my fingers, even though I wiped my hands off really good. I am now hesitant to use this product again because of that. I may give it one more chance because it really did increase the effectiveness of the tanning bed, but I don&#x27;t appreciate the blotches!!</li>
    <li> I try to put it on evenly but it still leaves streak marks on my arms and legs so you can tell where the lotion tanned and where the lotion didn&#x27;t tan.</li>
    <li> Best indoor tanning product I have ever used! Would have given 5 stars, but it did seem to stain palms a bit even with washing thoroughly after applying.</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned, and typically burn rather than tan, so I was skeptical to use this for fear of turning orange. I also am usually an avid fan of Designer Skin lotions, but I saw all the rave reviews for the Solid Black that I figured I would give it a try since it was a good price. Today was only my second trip to the tanner using this lotion and I am already noticeably darker! Definitely no orange tint, just a nice solid tan color. When I have tanned in the past it has usually taken me a good two weeks of tanning to be as dark as I am right now, and that was using Designer Skin Obsidian. I LOVE Solid Black! My first trip to the tanner with this lotion, I only used the bed for 6 minutes, and today for 8, just to give you an idea of JUST how easily I burn. As I said, I already am noticeably darker, and I have had NO streaks or orange spots between my fingers. I just wipe my hands well with the towel that they leave on the bed for you. This will definitely be my go to lotion from now on, I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to buy a tanning lotion online and especially one that I had never used before. I was pleasantly surprised when I started using it. It smells good and makes your skin really soft after tanning. It gave me really great dark tan with just a few uses. I would definately recomend it to anyone!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great and smells awesome, doesn&#x27;t leave a film either which i love! If you want soft skin and a nice tan grab this.</li>
    <li> I burn more with this lotion, compared to others.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY. I&#x27;m never using this again. My hands are orange and it gave me an orange based tan.</li>
    <li> I liked this product but used &amp;#34;Paint it Black&amp;#34; lotion before this and liked it a lot better. I felt that it had a better bronzer and felt silkier on my skin. Probably won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I get compliments everyday on what a beautiful tan I have! I have the most beautiful color! I already ordered another bottle!</li>
    <li> This product will turn your skin orange after the first 3 tans...Very disappointed!!! Would not recommend this lotion!! Smells great but works terrible!!</li>
    <li> great base starter, not for everyday use</li>
    <li> Pretty sure these people ripped me off and put a filler in . Didn&#x27;t work well, the effect of the &amp;#34;bronzers&amp;#34; weren&#x27;t showing either. Just make sure when you get this bottle it is properly sealed and unopened</li>
    <li> Excellent tanning product.  No staining.  Even and smooth application.</li>
    <li> Works good, dries quickly, haven&#x27;t noticed any spotting or blotching when using this product. Will order again, cheaper than anything they would sell you at a tanning establishment, and better than something you&#x27;d pay for at a local retailer as well. Smells decent and covers up that just tanned smell, wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s an immediate notice in darkness, but over time with consistent use I do notice when I have stopped for a day or two, and tanned without there is a difference until I use the product again!</li>
    <li> Works great first time use noticed difference</li>
    <li> Nice tan for fair skin. The smell is not girly and is a creamy lotion.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom she likes it.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, second time around and still purchasing same brand/same product.</li>
    <li> Gives good color, great price</li>
    <li> NO COLOR AND DULL SMELL!! WASTE OF MY MONEY.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this lotion multiple times and love it.  I use this one when its been a while in between tanning sessions.</li>
    <li> Gave me too much of and orange glow!</li>
    <li> ext happy with service and everything:)))))</li>
    <li> Good value good ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great for indoor tanning.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Smells good and keeps me tan and dark!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what i wanted in a darrrrrk tanning lotion. I was completely satisfied! Skeptical at first buy, but definitely worth it. Hope to do business with you guys again. Happy customer :)</li>
    <li> solid black broke my barrier and got my darker then i thought possible. i use it with a tingle combo and the beds are giving my a deep dark tan with this lotion money well spent. two thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and is AWESOME! ! Used only once so far and I have had multiple comments on my beautiful tan. Product does not feel oilly or tingly. Left my skin feeling smooth, soft and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Black &amp; Tan.  The consistency of this lotion is just the right thickness for easy application and the end result is a darker and longer lasting tan than the more expensive bronzer I had been using. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I just received my order and so disappointed its CHEAP ORANGE CRAP! Could have bought the same at Wal-Mart! !!!!!!!! It turned my husband&#x27;s and my hands ORANGE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I bought 3 bottles now I&#x27;m stuck with it!</li>
    <li> First i want to start off by saying I&#x27;m a redhead and I have extremely fair skin. I normally don&#x27;t care much if I am tan or not because who expects a tan &amp;#34;ginger&amp;#34;??? Anyways I have a trip to flordia coming up and the last thing I want to do is go there and get fried! So today I received my tanning lotion in the mail and nearly immediately went to tan. When I got out of the tanning bed I couldn&#x27;t really see that much of a difference, but literally 30 minutes later I was atleast 2 shades darker defiantly noticeable! AND I ONLY LAID ONE TIME! I really like this product I don&#x27;t think it has a distinct smell to it not bad though. Also not greasy and applies evenly. After I got out I applied aloe to make sure that my pale pale skin didn&#x27;t get damaged. REALLY I GUESS WHAT IM TRYING TO GET AT IS THAT I HAVE ALREADY GOT OUTSTANDING RESULTS! I can only imagine how tan it would make you if you weren&#x27;t already pale! Defiantly try this product out. If something happens and I end up finding something wrong with this product I will let it be known! But as of now I am beyond impressed!!!!!</li>
    <li> Terrible product. if there is anything nice to say about it, its that the smell isn&#x27;t terrible. it doesnt do much for me as far as helping me tan.</li>
    <li> Ive only used it twice and im getting a good color from it :) love love love will b buying it again :)</li>
    <li> This lotion is a great way to speed up the tanning bed process. The bronzers work quickly and even when I only tan for 8-9 minutes in a medium pressure bed (which normally won&#x27;t show much color after the first couple tans on me) I walk out looking noticeably naturally darker. The bronzers don&#x27;t leave you orange or streaky like some tanning lotions can however you HAVE to wipe your hands with a towel and make sure to get any of the lotion out from between your fingers otherwise it will turn orange/dark brown there. Not a huge fan of the smell but that isn&#x27;t a big deal for me.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion. It has a bronzer, so you have to apply it evenly to avoid streaking. When applied correctly, it gives you a deep dark tan in only a few tanning sessions.</li>
    <li> The smell is ok, however it works pretty good. It&#x27;s great actually. In a week with 4 tanning sessions I have a nice tan and it&#x27;s not a terrible snooki color.</li>
    <li> Did not want to look like an umpa-lumpa. It made me soo orange and streaky. HORRIBLE! giving it one stars because unlike other tanning lotions the smell didn&#x27;t stay on your skin forever, and it wasn&#x27;ta heavy lotion but... man -- never again!</li>
    <li> If you get this, your wife can too look like a baked potato!</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft and silky. It has a neutral smell, because nothing is worse than smelling like a coconut. It leaves a long lasting bronze quality.</li>
    <li> Was not my favorite bottle of lotion. Worked all right if you could get past the smell. I guess there was to much self tanner in it, also it will turn your hands orange if you dont wash them right away.</li>
    <li> I got this tanning lotion in september it is now january and the boddle still isn&#x27;t empty! It goes on very smooth and it smells great. You see an immediate darker color after one tanning session that looks natural. I reccomend putting it on after showering even when your not tanning just to give you a dark glow and a more bronzed look, it also helps maintain your tan. You should wash your hands after putting the lotion on or tanning, like in between your fingers because it is a bronzer. Over all great lotion and better then buying an expensive lotion at a salon!</li>
    <li> I will give this a 4 star rating since it was a great price. I have seen much higher priced lotions get high ratings, but honestly, if you tan well and you know the tanning bed you go to is serviced regularly you can&#x27;t go wrong. Since I have tanned for over 30 years in beds, and have owned my own, I consider myself an expert. Don&#x27;t pay ridiculous prices for those others. This worked fine.</li>
    <li> I like the color this lotion gives my skin and the lotion smells good when smelling it from the bottle. However, after you have tanned, it does not smell good and the scent remains on your skin until you shower. So if you GTL and then shower it&#x27;s a good lotion. If you plan to go out after your tanning session, purchase a different lotion.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Best tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> i liked this lotion and iv tried a lot. worked well. smelled decent. its a good lotion for the price</li>
    <li> One of the best Bronzers!  I have tanned for a long time and love when I find a product that gives these great results and keeps my skin hydrated.  It is so important to use a lotion that keeps your skin hydrated and youthful too!  This lotion smells great and I do not get that tanned skin after smell after tanning.  I hate smelling like baked skin after tanning like some lotions cause.  If you want that bronze sun kissed glow this is the lotion for you!!</li>
    <li> Bought this product with some hesitance. The tanning salon had it for sale for&lt;br /&gt;$85. It came in &amp; i tried it. Its a little watered down, but def gives you color! Its a great buy for $20! The bronze washes off after you shower, but it is def worth the buy! :)</li>
    <li> Works very well, and doesn&#x27;t smell weird. I love it</li>
    <li> I have bought lotions from my tanning salon and spend $100 per bottle so i am happy to find a good cheap bottle of lotion that does the same job. the only down side to any lotion is that the bottles to come with a safety seal.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent for the price we paid. I would reccomend this product to anyone going to the tanner. Great tan results</li>
    <li> Good lotion.  Delivered on time and as described.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I&#x27;ve done Designer Skin, Swedish Beauty, Australian Gold, and so forth products for the 6 years I&#x27;ve been tanning. I&#x27;m a mix of ethnicities ranging from Irish to Cherokee; thus my ability to tan is easy, the ability to get super dark is not easy. I have tanned daily for a month with multiple bronzers at the longest time possible and I would plateau on getting darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I got as dark as my darkest at the end of a month of daily tanning with other products in TWO sessions with THIS PRODUCT!! Six sessions later, and I&#x27;m dark with a gorgeous natural golden brown/bronze tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend! Pair it with the Juicy after-tan lotion! If you tan, you MUST take care of your skin!  Moisturize, Moisturize, Moisturize!!!</li>
    <li> On time and great quality! I 100% recommend it! Also good price for the quality. I&#x27;m 100% satisfied! I give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> I had not been tanning in like 3 years and purchased this product and got results immediately! It is great and goes on really light too.</li>
    <li> A must buy. This is seriously the best lotion I have ever used! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I used it with fair skin and after my first week I look like I have been tanning all year.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Quality great and came quickly. Would definitely purchase again👈</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that it had the bronzed so the first application I quickly threw on all over color was great , but in between my fingers stained and my ankle bone but its great besides that next application I will put on slowly then wash my hands</li>
    <li> I love it. this lotion gets me darker than I thought possible and fast. By far the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used and at a great price. I read in other reviews that it turns your hands orange. I haven&#x27;t had that problem. It has given me a very deep, natural looking tan. I will be getting another bottle when I run out of this one.</li>
    <li> Put some on before tanning, and didn&#x27;t get to wash my hands. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it turned me orange, it was more of a brown color in between my fingers, and around my ankles, and knees. If your wanting a lotion with strong brozers this is the one for you. It did make me a lot darker very fast, but I could do without the staining in between my fingers. I will most def. bring baby wipes next time. I am of native american descent, so I do have an olive/tan completion to begin with. I&#x27;m not sure if someone very pale tried this it might make them the orange color instead of the brown.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tan too often due to health risk but I tan fairly regularly.  I&#x27;ve been using a cheaper bottle I had to get at the tanning salon and I can&#x27;t hardly tell I tanned.  I used this 2 times and was fairly &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; with a good color natural tan.  Buy it on here way cheaper than you&#x27;d get at the tanning salon!</li>
    <li> Works amazing and a great price.</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT STUFF JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE SAID.I HAVE ONLY TANNED 4 TIMES AND IM ALREADY GETTING DARK.I WII BUY AGAIN.ALSO IT WAS SHIPPED SUPER FAST. THANKS</li>
    <li> Smells breat and doesn&#x27;t leave a horrible oder after tanning.  However, I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my tan.</li>
    <li> Love the results I am getting from this lotion!  A beautiful, even, dark tan.  No spots or smudges from this lotion.</li>
    <li> This was sold by &amp;#34;Authentic Tanning Products&amp;#34; and it is most definitely a fake. I would give it zero stars if I could but that&#x27;s not an option. I had zero difference in color and it smells like garbage. After tanning I really started to smell like a landfill and neither my man nor my cat wanted anything to do with me. I literally smell like something that has been scraped off of the floor at a fast food restaurant. Gross. Absolutely NO bronzing. No bronzing, no nothing. Does my skin feel soft? Well yea but I&#x27;m sure it would even if I had lathered myself in Crisco which probably would&#x27;ve given me a better tan. Do not buy this product because you&#x27;re not guaranteed the real thing. I&#x27;m going to return it because why would I keep lotion that makes me smell so badly that I&#x27;m afraid to go outside because seagulls would probably follow me around pecking at my skull. No thank you. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing. The color of the tan enhanced by the bronzer is dark and rich. Smells great and moisterizing! The seller delivers it to me very quickly! Would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Good bronzers that work with the beds well</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this bronzer to anyone!! It streaks really bad and makes you look like a orange. Plus if you make the mistake I did and don&#x27;t wash your hands immediately after, you will have nice orange palms. I usually love bronzers, but I will not be using this ever again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is poop. It leaves streaks on your body after tanning and is very runny. More of an orange color than anything. DONT WASTE YOUR MOOLA.</li>
    <li> Love the tanning lotion! Ordered one for myself and one for my mother, we both love it and are going to order more! My sister was using it as well and will be ordering her some too!</li>
    <li> By far the best tanning lotion I have ever used!!! Would highly recommend. And it smells really good to! Would not recommend wearing white right after using though</li>
    <li> Great &amp; moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Works great and gives my tan an extra boost.  Took me to the next level without having to have a tingle lotion.</li>
    <li> I originally bought some cheap stuff at Walmart and it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. My tan was much more prominent after using this and I definitely noticed a difference after a few days of tanning with this! I love the smell too, it smells like spring break. I would recommend this if you want to build your tan faster.</li>
    <li> I am an advanced tanner who almost exclusively used the same lotion for an extended period time.  It worked well and I had a pretty dark tan but unexpectedly came to a plateau and started to lighten instead of darken so I switched to this lotion and received the look I was trying for.  Not only does it work well but you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I have only used this tanning lotion 3 times so far, but I noticed a big difference the VERY FIRST time I used it!! It smells good also....love it!</li>
    <li> great product  and fast shipping. thank you so much</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for a couple ofhe salon price years now and I found this product to be the best, it doesn&#x27;t smell, goes on smooth, not greasy and it gives you a wonderful natural looking dark tan, and buying it here is way better than paying the salon price</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion!  I am seriously one of the whitest, white kids and have never been more than slightly golden tan.  I have used this a few times and have a wonderful bronze tan!  Darker than I have ever been!  And for all the complaints about streaking,  just make sure you rub it all the way in (doesn&#x27;t feel wet at all) and wash your hands when you get out (which you should do anyways.  Gross.  How many naked people been touching the same things lol? )  Overall great product! Highly recommend!  &amp; so do my friends that keep asking to use my lotion!</li>
