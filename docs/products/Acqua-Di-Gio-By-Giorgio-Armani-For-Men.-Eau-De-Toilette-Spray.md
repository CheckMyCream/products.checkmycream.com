      <li>Yep... i love this....</li>
      <li>Ive always enjoyed the smell of this colonge.</li>
      <li>Everybody should wear it. :)</li>
      <li>the tiniest bottle and on top of that</li>
      <li>The scent itself is considered an &amp;#34;aquatic,&amp;#34; but it seems more like a combination of lemon and metallic.</li>
      <li>but I guess it&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>This is my sons favorite cologne.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>Love this fragrance...</li>
      <li>Nice clean scent for daytime wear.</li>
      <li>Genuine product which I really love.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know how strong of a point that is.</li>
      <li>and he liked it very much</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and not heavy.  </li>
      <li>Prompt shipping and accurate description</li>
      <li>Great cologne for the summer, and lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>True to picture.</li>
      <li>but I received exactly what I expected and smells great as always.</li>
      <li>Great smell - its a little pricey, but worth it to me.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>But if you look around on amazon I&#x27;ve noticed better deals recently.</li>
      <li>this stuff is like magic, been wearing it for years, I get compliments from women young and old</li>
      <li>but Classic  scent!</li>
      <li>and I love the smell not too strong and not too weak, ii is a cologne that attracts my sense of smell very much.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>got it for my main man</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll stick with Nautica Voyage, which us just better all around and half the price!</li>
      <li>, just got him a new one</li>
      <li>A complete rip for the price.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, the bf loves it, and it came quickly plus it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
      <li>However, Perry Ellis 360 Red smells almost EXACTLY the same.  </li>
      <li>But this cologne that I got smelled just like the real thing and lasted just as long.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected and paid for</li>
      <li>Great scent high price, I was really disappointed.</li>
      <li>The only differences between AdG and Perry Ellis 360 Red are that PE has a slightly stronger cinnamon scent, which I actually enjoy.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t very strong, and it fades (dry down) in less than an hour.</li>
      <li>A little expensive for the size, great stocking stuffer .</li>
      <li>Why would you make something out of glass that has a high center of gravity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Long time go-to</li>
<li> This is costly for such a small tiny bottle.</li>
<li> Lastly, PE can be had for half the price of AdG.  </li>
<li> I love the scent so how could I write a bad review.</li>
<li> But if you would like to save a few bucks, I would recommend Perry Ellis 360 Red.</li>
<li> Was as expected.</li>
<li> So the small bottle should last you a while.</li>
<li> considering it&#x27;s such a small bottle.</li>
<li> A little weak only last a few hours</li>
<li> I have previously bought this product before for my fiance as a gift</li>
<li> i soon need another one i use it everyday...</li>
<li> Very small bottle</li>
<li> alas.</li>
<li> Was skeptical after reading reviews</li>
<li> but I am a fake to wit</li>
<li> all the comments tell me it is fake</li>
<li> What stupidity...</li>
<li> - I hate PE bottles - they are tall and thin.  </li>
<li> I believe it fake!</li>
<li> I was an Idiot!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great. I have yet to receive compliments while wearing it, but I never get any wearing anything else either, so I don&#x27;t know how strong of a point that is.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. The smell is pleasant and not heavy.  All the men in our family use it.</li>
    <li> A little expensive for the size, great stocking stuffer .</li>
    <li> Everyone says not to buy cologne specifically from amazon because of &amp;#34;shady businesses&amp;#34; and that they may try to scam you. But this cologne that I got smelled just like the real thing and lasted just as long. You are getting what you pay for it, which is everything you would expect to get.</li>
    <li> Arrived on-time and sealed. Genuine product which I really love. Perfect size for carrying on a plane (unchecked luggage).</li>
    <li> Was skeptical after reading reviews but I received exactly what I expected and smells great as always. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance, well worth price.Fast delivery. My son is a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> this stuff is like magic, been wearing it for years, I get compliments from women young and old they love it!</li>
    <li> This scent is always a great buy for boyfriend, guy friend, or even dads. It smells amazing without being too overpowering.</li>
    <li> This Is Messed Up! I Bought The Same One For $50.00 And I See This For $20.00!! What A RIP OFF!!!!</li>
    <li> got it for my main man</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Great scent. I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t tried it before now. Will continue to wear and probably order here.</li>
    <li> Ive always enjoyed the smell of this colonge.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent.  Without a doubt.  5 star.  However, Perry Ellis 360 Red smells almost EXACTLY the same.  The only differences between AdG and Perry Ellis 360 Red are that PE has a slightly stronger cinnamon scent, which I actually enjoy.  Also, PE seems to have slightly better longevity and projection.  Lastly, PE can be had for half the price of AdG.  The only advantage AdG has is with the bottle - I hate PE bottles - they are tall and thin.  Why would you make something out of glass that has a high center of gravity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this stuff is awesome.  But if you would like to save a few bucks, I would recommend Perry Ellis 360 Red.</li>
    <li> Nice clean scent for daytime wear.</li>
    <li> Rip off.....the tiniest bottle and on top of that the smell does not last....I believe it fake! DONT BUY!</li>
    <li> I would swoon if my cat was wearing this. I love the scent so how could I write a bad review. (the problem is- my last 3 boyfriends have it now. You would think that I would start to dis-like it....alas. That is not the case.)</li>
    <li> This Cologne is fire. Love it. Gonna get it again in 2 weeks.. This is one of my favorite colognes now.</li>
    <li> I want to buy this product but I am a fake to wit all the comments tell me it is fake</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years! Love it</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance...two sprays last all day</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, the bf loves it, and it came quickly plus it wasn&#x27;t very expensive. Good stuff. Everybody should wear it. :)</li>
    <li> Its really good calone. Smells good and lasts all day. Wish it was cheaper  considering it&#x27;s such a small bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband smells like liquid sex when he wears this.</li>
    <li> For being one of the top men&#x27;s scents on the market and so highly rated here, I must say I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. It isn&#x27;t very strong, and it fades (dry down) in less than an hour. The scent itself is considered an &amp;#34;aquatic,&amp;#34; but it seems more like a combination of lemon and metallic. I guess I&#x27;ll stick with Nautica Voyage, which us just better all around and half the price!</li>
    <li> I have previously bought this product before for my fiance as a gift and he liked it very much, just got him a new one he and I love the smell not too strong and not too weak, ii is a cologne that attracts my sense of smell very much.</li>
    <li> Very small bottle but I guess it&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> This stuff is sexy in a bottle. Buy it. Smell good. End.</li>
    <li> Quality Made! Thus is some goooooood stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I was an Idiot!  I thought I was getting more than a salesman&#x27;s sample!  What stupidity...I should have checked the Fluid Ounces. I got Ripped Off!</li>
    <li> An invigorating fragrance.  I use it after the shower at the gym, as a better alternative to Code.</li>
    <li> Glad to have this. Great smell!</li>
    <li> I do not think, this product needs any feedback. Armani speaks for itself. You buy it, you wear it, you love it!</li>
    <li> For $40 I&#x27;m going to get about 40 sprays from this. A complete rip for the price. Do some shopping on another site and you can get twice the size for the same price.</li>
    <li> Great smell - its a little pricey, but worth it to me.  Great cologne for the summer, and lasts a long time.  So the small bottle should last you a while.</li>
    <li> A little weak only last a few hours but Classic  scent! I have Issey miyake as well and this comes a close 2nd to my fav list.</li>
    <li> My son received this as a gift this year and thoroughly enjoys the scent.  It arrived on time without damage.</li>
    <li> best cologne out right now.  ask the ladies!!</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price</li>
    <li> On time delivery and GIO smell good. I have know complaints</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my boyfriend because it&#x27;s his favorite cologne. The item shipped in a great time frame, and was well packaged and handled with care. True to picture.</li>
    <li> This is costly for such a small tiny bottle. Go to the mall kiosk. Great scent high price, I was really disappointed. But if you look around on amazon I&#x27;ve noticed better deals recently.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell at all - causes me to sneeze.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and paid for</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping and accurate description</li>
    <li> Yep... i love this.... i soon need another one i use it everyday...</li>
    <li> This is my sons favorite cologne.  I will definitely order again</li>
    <li> Long time go-to but I switched to Armani Code and am happier for it.</li>
