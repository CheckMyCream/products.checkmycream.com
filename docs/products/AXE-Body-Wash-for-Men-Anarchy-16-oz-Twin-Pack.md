      <li>It was great.</li>

      <li>Fragrance is very nice.</li>
      <li>Amazing scent!</li>
      <li>Nice body wash!  </li>
      <li>It also is a good shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I really loved this product.</li>
      <li>And it smells really good.  </li>
      <li>You know, it isn&#x27;t a good idea to drop your soap in the shower.</li>
      <li>surprising downside here was the packaging.</li>
      <li>Good stuff.  </li>
      <li>Five REFRESHING Stars!</li>
      <li>It lathers up nicely.  </li>
      <li>An okay wash that bases its appeal on the ability to smell good for gals.  </li>
      <li>product lathers well, cleans quite nicely without feeling either oily or drying.  </li>
      <li>The soap lathers well and rinses off nicely.  </li>
      <li>A nice product that doesn&#x27;t break the bank - always nice to find.</li>
      <li>But it smells nice and cleans well as a body wash.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is nice, I like it.</li>
      <li>it smells nice - from the bottle, But when I lather, it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>We both really like the scent and very happy with it.</li>
      <li>I get compliments all of the time at how nice I smell.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s refreshing and it smells very good, leaves a clean feeling.</li>
      <li>What I like most about it is that as you are using it there is a cooling tingling sensation that is very refreshing.</li>
      <li>Very strong smell.</li>
      <li>I found it perfect for my early morning showers.</li>
      <li>So far this is one of the best shower gels that is in the market.</li>
      <li>Scent is awesome, but doesn&#x27;t linger too long after use, which can be a good thing if you&#x27;re one to throw on some body spray or cologne afterwards.</li>
      <li>Another great thing is that the price is right.</li>
      <li>Smells really good, nice potent smell, really great to combination it with dry spray in which I get a lot of compliments.</li>
      <li>Not so sure about all that.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Being a lotion rather a watery liquid makes it seems all that more elegant.  </li>
      <li>Axe White Label Body Wash has a wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>and I have been satisfied with most of them.</li>
      <li>I get better results, and much better scent, with Burt&#x27;s Bees Men&#x27;s Bath Soap liquid.</li>
      <li>I love using the AXE scents after my morning workout when I&#x27;m showering to go somewhere.</li>
      <li>But this is 16 ounce of a wonderful combination of lavender, cedar wood, grapefruit and praline, definitely not something my hubby would be caught using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: When I received the package there was some purple ooze at the top of the bottle, but it did not leak further.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
      <li>Okay, perhaps some wood</li>
      <li>I think i smelled the lavender and cedar wood most.</li>
      <li>Ok/average body wash, but there is much better.  </li>
      <li>Four stars because it seems to please its target customer in this household. :-)</li>
      <li>I decided to try this shower gel because my husband love most everything Axe.</li>
      <li>I love when my man washes with this before bedtime.</li>
      <li>It can be used anytime you shower but is particularly good at night right before bed (lavender has soothing qualities that help you relax and get to sleep).</li>
      <li>/&gt;AXE is a great product and they have a great line of other products too.</li>
      <li>I could not figure out which brand, but the fragrance is very familiar.</li>
      <li>It lathers up nicely and the rich suds make me feel like I’m in a bubble bath even when I’m in the shower.  </li>
      <li>The scent is quite strong and lingers, though, so if you can you will want to smell it before purchase to make sure it is a scent you like.</li>
      <li>Seems like a very good hair and body wash, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>; I can&#x27;t  really say that any one of those elements stood out to me, but boy, this smells good.</li>
      <li>After a shower, well I&#x27;ll admit, it does kind of smell fresh.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s has a very light and clean smell.</li>
      <li>It works well, and is easy to rinse off (thus not leave a residue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would easily try this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>The bottle was easily rinsed off, and the box discarded.</li>
      <li>It runs out of your hands too easily.</li>
      <li>fumes become so strong, it burns my eyes when i wash my chest and neck.</li>
      <li>scent is strong though and it lingers in the bathroom and your skin for quite some time.</li>
      <li>If you like Axe products you will probably like this one...not too strong, has a tingly feel on skin.</li>
      <li>And that dudes will like strong smells and funky colors in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
      <li>Way strong.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It still smells strong.</li>
      <li>Slightly lighter scent than Gold Temptation but very refreshing and pleasant.</li>
      <li>the way, that&#x27;s a huge bottle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;I received this product free in exchange for providing an unbiased review.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>but if you are like me and rarely have any BO at all... this becomes overwhelming for those around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this axe scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and not overpowering, and it lasts quite a while after my shower.</li>
      <li>Regardless I do enjoy this and will buy it again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re not a no GMO, organic, fragrance free guy.</li>
      <li>which is great if you have massive BO that needs covering...</li>
      <li>I found the original Axe Body Wash much better, I felt a sense of being fresh, which this version lacks.</li>
      <li>It gets you clean with a fresh but not overbearing scent and it can be used on the hair or body, for maximum convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe products have made their way into my home more than once</li>
      <li>I normally am turned off by AXE body sprays, but I love their body washes!  </li>
      <li>Leaves one feeling and smelling shower fresh for hours!</li>
      <li>Washes off clean.  </li>
      <li>The purple color rinses clean from washcloths without the use of bleach.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it wears off quickly.</li>
      <li>It rinses off easily and clearly and leaves me feeling relaxed and ready for bed with a good book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I think most will agree that it’s as good as any other men’s body gel on the market.</li>
      <li>Lightly floral, yet still very masculine, this is all in all a great scent and exciting new addition to the Axe selection.</li>
      <li>This 2 in 1 body wash and shampoo is as good as the rest, with a scent that is cologne- like, but with added aromas such as citrus and lavender.</li>
      <li>cool rush of grapefruit, lavender, cedarwood and praline</li>
      <li>This version of Axe Body wash is just ok, I don&#x27;t like the smell all that much.</li>
      <li>but instead just enough to smell good.</li>
      <li>This is overall a good body wash.</li>
      <li>This scent is also in the dry spray deodorant which i also have and its a great combo after feeling freshly washed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>came leaking in the box, so my mailbox and shipping box smelled super manly.</li>
      <li>This particular scent wasn&#x27;t my favorite as it was a bit muskier than I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, keeps it fairly hydrated.</li>
      <li>Most men&#x27;s products are strongly scented, and this on is no different.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you like Axe products you will probably like this one...not too strong, has a tingly feel on skin. One of their best scents.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of Axe&#x27;s worst products. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. it smells nice - from the bottle, But when I lather, it&#x27;s a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fumes become so strong, it burns my eyes when i wash my chest and neck. I had the same issue once  with a Suave brand men&#x27;s body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very difficult to use due to the fumes.</li>
    <li> Smells really good, nice potent smell, really great to combination it with dry spray in which I get a lot of compliments. So far this is one of the best shower gels that is in the market.</li>
    <li> Five BENEFICIAL Stars. This Axe &#x27;White Label&#x27; “Night” body wash is advertised as mixing the interesting amonas of  &amp;#34;grapefruit, lavender, cedar wood and praline notes” which combine into a fresh ‘invigorating’ scent. In two weeks of use, ’Night&#x27; is a very effective skin cleanser whose distinctive fragrance lasts on the skin, within the ‘personal space’ of 2-3 feet, for a few hours and then the fragrance disappears. I like its effectiveness and the fact that it is a thick purple liquid that lasts longer than the thinner body washes. The purple color rinses clean from washcloths without the use of bleach. I have also used Axe ‘White Label’ “Forest” brand with the same results. Highly Recommended. Five REFRESHING Stars! (1-16 ounce/473 mL plastic bottle of Axe ‘White Label’ “Night” body wash.)</li>
    <li> This is a very good product</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the White Label line of AXE, especially the &amp;#34;Night&amp;#34; fragrance. The White Label line has very high-quality scents with unique, natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;  This body wash is GREAT! I love that it has lavender and other soothing ingredients in it while still having a masculine scent to it. The scent it very prominent and lasts a long time, too! This Night scent really relaxes you and winds you down in the evening. Also makes my skin soft to the touch. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Very strong smell. which is great if you have massive BO that needs covering... but if you are like me and rarely have any BO at all... this becomes overwhelming for those around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell though, my gf doesn&#x27;t enjoy it as much as I do, so I will use it less often.</li>
    <li> lathers up real well. I like that i don&#x27;t have to use a lot like some others to get it sudsy. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, keeps it fairly hydrated. Another great thing is that the price is right. Its not expensive at all and you get a large bottle of it. The color is a deep purple, it doesn&#x27;t stain that I can tell. Although, when I got mine it was packaged poorly in one of those zip open book size cardboard folders with no plastic bag or taped top so....the mailman had a slightly messy package do deliver as it leaked a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AXE is a great product and they have a great line of other products too. This particular fragrance is Grapefruit, lavender, cedar wood and praline. I think i smelled the lavender and cedar wood most. Its stronger when showering but not after toweling dry. This scent is also in the dry spray deodorant which i also have and its a great combo after feeling freshly washed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its worth it to try it especially that its inexpensive and lathers well.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent! This body wash has such a premium scent to it, you have to smell to appreciate it. The scent reminds me of Polo Crest cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash cleans well and the soap doesn&#x27;t leave my body feeling dry after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying more of this one.</li>
    <li> Works all right as a bath soap, but the smell is sort of chemical-ish. Fortunately, it wears off quickly. I get better results, and much better scent, with Burt&#x27;s Bees Men&#x27;s Bath Soap liquid. The Burt&#x27;s Bees product seems to be a better buy since a little goes a long way, whereas the AXE shower gel takes more product for the same result.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the smell, but the same issue as other Axe body washes, the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long at all!</li>
    <li> At this point it is pretty much safe to say that you can&#x27;t go wrong with an Axe product. I have been using their body sprays for awhile now and have like almost all of their different scents. I was interested in trying this bodywash because I was curious what it would smell like. Well let me say that this scent is somewhat  different from other varities I have tried. It is a masculine scent that sticks with you for an hour or two after use. What I like most about it is that as you are using it there is a cooling tingling sensation that is very refreshing. I found it perfect for my early morning showers. It&#x27;s like a wake me up.</li>
    <li> This is overall a good body wash. It works well, and is easy to rinse off (thus not leave a residue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things:&lt;br /&gt;One: When I received the package there was some purple ooze at the top of the bottle, but it did not leak further.&lt;br /&gt;Two: It smells like shaving cream. I could not figure out which brand, but the fragrance is very familiar. It is not too bad, but I&#x27;m not sure I would like to smell like that. (For example, I&#x27;ve already changed my shaving cream).</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of this product. I feel it was watered down too much, compared to other Axe body washes.</li>
    <li> Nice body wash!  I get compliments all of the time at how nice I smell.  I even got one from a person who says they &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; Axe products because of their smell but she didn&#x27;t know that I had used it...so...yeah.  I haven&#x27;t been disappointing by an axe product yet and so will keep using them.</li>
    <li> I fell for it, the new advertising and the new color for Axe. I figured this would be something different. A lighter brighter less teenage boy trying to pick up chicks smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. It is the same old Axe, still dedicated to the thought that women like strong smells. And that dudes will like strong smells and funky colors in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, this soap is purple. Not lavender purple - Prince purple, Royal Purple Oil purple. I have no idea why this is purple and not green or yellow. I get it why they wouldn&#x27;t make it red. Yeah, that would be gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still smells strong. Way strong. After a shower, well I&#x27;ll admit, it does kind of smell fresh. But a guy shouldn&#x27;t need that much fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re not a no GMO, organic, fragrance free guy. You don&#x27;t mind using chemicals. This is your body wash, man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, that&#x27;s a huge bottle. Go ahead and squeeze out a lot for the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the cap - you press the little Vee to open it up snap cap top style. And the bottle is tapered in the middle with grippers, so you won&#x27;t drop your soap in the shower. You know, it isn&#x27;t a good idea to drop your soap in the shower.</li>
    <li> As a long time Axe product user, this scent is a departure from their usual, but it is nonetheless a more mature scent for a more mature person.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this axe scent.  It is subtle when I am in the shower but lingers on nicely after the shower is over.  It lathers up nicely.  It is purple in color and leaked slightly in the shipping so the nice white bottle has some purple stains on it.  Regardless I do enjoy this and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> When I see the name Axe, I think of something for men.  But this is 16 ounce of a wonderful combination of lavender, cedar wood, grapefruit and praline, definitely not something my hubby would be caught using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a lotion rather a watery liquid makes it seems all that more elegant.  It lathers up nicely and the rich suds make me feel like I’m in a bubble bath even when I’m in the shower.  It rinses off easily and clearly and leaves me feeling relaxed and ready for bed with a good book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received this product free in exchange for providing an unbiased review.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a startlingly purple product - a bit of a surprise.  And it smells really good.  My husband and I have both used it, and I really do like the scent.  I can&#x27;t say that about some Axe products - some are overpowering, at least to my nose.  It&#x27;s definitely a masculine scent - woodsy and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product lathers well, cleans quite nicely without feeling either oily or drying.  It rinses off well, leaving nothing but that scent.  And a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve used it with both washcloths and a nylon net scrubber ball thingy - works with both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prices change frequently, so the shopper will have to decide for himself whether this is worth the price, but at the time I got a bottle, it was quite reasonably priced.  A nice product that doesn&#x27;t break the bank - always nice to find.</li>
    <li> Predictably lovely, for those that are already fans of Axe, you shall not be disappointed. This new &amp;#34;Night&amp;#34; series in the white bottle seems to be aimed at a slightly different use than regular body wash. Though still heavily fragranced, the scent is much less &amp;#34;sporty&amp;#34; than typical Axe Body Wash, and leaves you with more subtle, and dare I say &amp;#34;Sexy&amp;#34; scent on your skin. I would definitely recommend using this before going out on a date or right before hopping into bed for a little frolic with your partner. Lightly floral, yet still very masculine, this is all in all a great scent and exciting new addition to the Axe selection.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my first Axe shower gel. That&#x27;s strange, because normally I avoid anything Axe branded since I&#x27;m not 16 and under the impression that women swoon under the influence of strange, noxious vapor trails emanating from my body like a cartoon skunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the body wash is not like the sprays.  I first tried an Axe body wash, purely out of necessity, because it was on sale and I was on a business trip for a month and had no personal hygiene products with me.  At that time, I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that while I could still smell it on myself for the first few minutes, it was effectively gone by the time I had left the loft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here we are now, there&#x27;s a &amp;#34;white label&amp;#34; Axe shower gel. I&#x27;m not sure what &amp;#34;white label&amp;#34; means unless we&#x27;re talking about scotch, but as far as shower gels go, it works about as well as any decent shower gel I&#x27;ve used. And by that I mean that I got in to the shower feeling not clean, and left the shower feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, I like it. It&#x27;s not too nightclubby or frathouse-y or creepy, and crucially, it dissipates quickly.  After 15 minutes or so you might still be able to smell it on yourself in the form of an occasional whiff, but if another person is close enough to you to be able to smell it after that amount of time then you&#x27;re likely beyond the point where either of you care what your body wash smells like.</li>
    <li> I gave this new Ae White Lable Body Wash to my 15-year-old son to use and he loves it. He likes the way it dispenses, the way it foams and the refreshed feeling after use. While he said he likes the smell, he felt like the slightly citrusy scent was a bit feminine, although my wife smelled it and thought was still quite &amp;#34;manly.&amp;#34; Seems like a very good hair and body wash, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I normally am turned off by AXE body sprays, but I love their body washes!  It&#x27;s just enough gentle fragrance as to not be overwhelming. I love when my man washes with this before bedtime. It&#x27;s not an in your face fragrance that would make me miserable (I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrance) but instead just enough to smell good. I love using the AXE scents after my morning workout when I&#x27;m showering to go somewhere. They are all invigorating and relaxing and make me ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus side is that they are not drying and don&#x27;t make my skin feel two sizes too small for my body. They have generous lather and are gentle. This says it&#x27;s a hair/body wash but I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s for a guy with very short hair. I wouldn&#x27;t want to use this detergent-y stuff on hair myself.</li>
    <li> Axe White Label Body Wash has a wonderful scent. The wash is dark blue and produces great lather. It also is a good shampoo.  I really loved this product.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this shower gel because my husband love most everything Axe. It does the job lathering up, washing, and rinsing away, but the entire house smells like this shower gel when he&#x27;s done showering. Most men&#x27;s products are strongly scented, and this on is no different. I just don&#x27;t understand why. I would rather have a product that cleans and deodorizes rather than something that just tries to cover up the smell with more smell. I tried to use it myself and I can&#x27;t use it without opening a door or window. If you want something with a strong scent, this is it, but if you want something subtle, keep looking. Four stars because it seems to please its target customer in this household. :-)</li>
    <li> I have actively used Axe brand body wash (and deodorant) for the past several years. This was my first time to try the White Label, and I will admit that I had a hard time figuring out the difference between this special brand and typical Axe in a black bottle.  To be honest, I am still not sure I know the difference.  For me, it is all about the fragrance. And while I do like most Axe products, there are a few misses  along with the hits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately this Night body wash smelled great. The packaging promises &amp;#34;a cool rush of grapefruit, lavender, cedarwood and praline notes.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t  really say that any one of those elements stood out to me, but boy, this smells good. It&#x27;s light and not overpowering, and it lasts quite a while after my shower. I would easily try this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One surprising downside here was the packaging. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with getting liquid products by mail, but this bottle arrived in a standard cardboard book-sized box with no padding or wrapping. I could tell immediately that the box was wet. Sure enough the Axe bottle was just slightly open,  and a sizable amount of the body wash and run down the bottle and covered the inside of the cardboard.  The bottle was easily rinsed off, and the box discarded. However, I do think I lost about a fifth of the bottle.  So, packaging was surprisingly disappointing, I had no issues with the product itself. It was great.</li>
    <li> This version of Axe Body wash is just ok, I don&#x27;t like the smell all that much. It does clean your body alright, but  it lacks a sense lather and feels thin. It runs out of your hands too easily. I found the original Axe Body Wash much better, I felt a sense of being fresh, which this version lacks. I also don&#x27;t like how it dries out my hair. Overall a bit disappointing. I would not buy because of the unpleasant smell, and lack of feeling clean after using. Plus it&#x27;s so runny it really is hard to keep an amount in hand.</li>
    <li> Never had a purple body wash before! It smells great though--although it smells quite different than you would expect it to from the list of different scent combinations.</li>
    <li> Odd color (purple).  But it smells nice and cleans well as a body wash.  I have preferred the Irish Spring body wash but will start using this as an alternate from time to time.  I like the bottle as it is easy for me to grip and snap open and shut.  Pleased overall, no complaints.  4 stars.</li>
    <li> This body wash contains menthol so it&#x27;ll numb your genitals. It feels like icy-hot or something... wish there was a disclaimer. It&#x27;s not awesome tingling, more like terrible a numb-sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your typical &amp;#34;Man Scent&amp;#34;, i.e. Davidoff &#x27;Cool Water&#x27;, or Ralph Lauren&#x27;s &#x27;Polo&#x27;. You get a good lather with this dark purple liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came leaking in the box, so my mailbox and shipping box smelled super manly.</li>
    <li> The first thing I thought before trying Axe White Label Body Wash was: \\&quot;how overpowering is the fragrance going to be\\&quot;? Much to my surprise, it is not bad at all. It has a modest, masculine scent. Despite a slight lavender scent, it doesn&#x27;t make me stink like flowers like most unisex body wash. It just smells \\&quot;good\\&quot;. A little bit provides a lot of lather too. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells great and works great.</li>
    <li> Hate the smell and it burns.</li>
    <li> Ever tried Axe Excite Body Wash or Shampoo / Conditioner?  Yes?  Then you already know what you&#x27;re getting into Axe White Label Night.  No, you haven&#x27;t tried Excite?  Then let me give you a little insight.  It&#x27;s purple, it&#x27;s very fruitish / flowery in fragrance &amp; it&#x27;s otherwise just another Axe standard trope.  But don&#x27;t get me wrong, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with being typical Axe.  I&#x27;ve been using Axe for a long time.  But Excite... um I mean Night is a little too sweet smelling.  It has an almost fruit candy smell to it.  For those wondering how the comparison of Excite &amp; Night works - they both have that smell &amp; are purple.  Otherwise, I didn&#x27;t really hate it.  It&#x27;s just not the scent I normally would get from Axe.  On the other hand, for something new - it seems rather old.  3 1/2 stars rounded up to 4.</li>
    <li> Axe is one of those love it or hate it scents. I happen to like it in small doses, opting for the Axe Phoenix as my deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you&#x27;ll notice is the deep purple color, which seems a bit unnecessary and more like something from a monster movie but I guess it might be desirable to a younger demographic. Luckily though, once it lathers with a loofah or scrub, the suds go back to a clearer whiter foam. And a little goes a long way here since this body wash is much more concentrated than many other comparable brands. I probably have to use 2-3 times the amount of Method body wash to get the same amount of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is strong though and it lingers in the bathroom and your skin for quite some time. This particular scent wasn&#x27;t my favorite as it was a bit muskier than I&#x27;d like. I can see it pairing well after a sweaty day or working out, which I typically use this for.</li>
    <li> I like the flavor, however it can be a bit overpowering. Dries out my skin a bit, not as hydrating as the Dove for Men products.</li>
    <li> Ok/average body wash, but there is much better.  The wash itself is a deep purple, and the scent is sweetish.  Scent does not last past mid-morning.  The suds are light and don&#x27;t feel as thick as other washes like Dove, Dial, or Renew.  Washes off clean.  Leaves my skin just a little dry compared to Renew wash, but still acceptable.  An okay wash that bases its appeal on the ability to smell good for gals.  Not so sure about all that.</li>
    <li> This body wash is designed for men (although women could use it too) and has a musky fragrance with hints of lavender. It is a dark purple color (a bit disconcerting at first) and is very refreshing. It can be used anytime you shower but is particularly good at night right before bed (lavender has soothing qualities that help you relax and get to sleep). The fragrance does not linger on my body.</li>
    <li> Good masculine scent and lots of lather for just a small amount of the wash. Slightly lighter scent than Gold Temptation but very refreshing and pleasant.</li>
    <li> Personal items made for men often have a manly, cologne- like scent and Axe is known for taking this concept and sometimes carrying it to extremes. Body washes often follow this trend, but Axe White Label Body Wash is a little different. It gets you clean with a fresh but not overbearing scent and it can be used on the hair or body, for maximum convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe products have made their way into my home more than once and I have been satisfied with most of them. This 2 in 1 body wash and shampoo is as good as the rest, with a scent that is cologne- like, but with added aromas such as citrus and lavender. The manufacturer claims there are other scents present like wood, pralines, etc. but the ones I notice are cologne, citrus, and lavender. Okay, perhaps some wood but pralines?- I don’t know where they get that. The overall smell is pleasant and it’s neutral enough that the ladies in the home might even consider a squirt when in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe White Label 2 in 1 hair and body wash is purple in color, applies easily, and washes clean with no residue. I normally don’t like to use these 2 in 1 products on my hair, but this one actually does a decent job with cleaning the hair and scalp. Of course, I don’t have as much hair as other people so my opinion on the matter may not carry much weight. But it does work well for this purpose and that means you don’t need a separate shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe makes lots of good, dependable men’s personal care products and Axe White Label 2 in 1 hair and body wash ranks among them. It’s less pricey than others and it does a good job getting you clean with a nice but not overwhelming scent. I like it enough to buy it again and I think most will agree that it’s as good as any other men’s body gel on the market.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it - it&#x27;s refreshing and it smells very good, leaves a clean feeling. Excellent!</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> The reason why I graded &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; is because it does not emit a scent after showering, unlike other scents from Axe.</li>
    <li> Yum! Leaves one feeling and smelling shower fresh for hours!</li>
    <li> I like AXE products&#x27; scents.  This one smells great. Fresh and clean.  Menthol is one of the ingredients and I appreciate cooling sensation after a long day to refresh or in the morning to help me wake up.  I just wish the gel was not dark purple.  White, light green, and light blue, not dark purple, associate with cleanliness and freshness in my mind.  Drops of gel need to be washed off the bottle or they create unsightly mess.</li>
    <li> I have never used Axe branded products before but have always been curious about them.  This Axe White Label body wash has a very strong but masculine smell.  Actually, I really like the scent a lot.  So does my wife.  The soap is purple, which I could tell even before using it as some leaked out during shipping (disappointing, Amazon -- something like this really should be wrapped in a plastic bag prior to shipping).  The soap lathers well and rinses off nicely.  It does not make my skin feel overly dry.  Definitely a product I would recommend for any man.  The scent is quite strong and lingers, though, so if you can you will want to smell it before purchase to make sure it is a scent you like.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend since we can&#x27;t find it in stores where we live, only the shampoo.  We both really like the scent and very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Rinses well. Doesn&#x27;t leave soap residue behind. Fragrance is very nice. My wife agrees.</li>
    <li> Scent is awesome, but doesn&#x27;t linger too long after use, which can be a good thing if you&#x27;re one to throw on some body spray or cologne afterwards. Gel doesn&#x27;t lather unless you use a loofah which I don&#x27;t care to use, so you might yourself going through the bottle faster than you&#x27;d like. I&#x27;m going to finish the whole bottle but honestly might just switch back to the Old Spice or Dove Men&#x27;s, both which are more versatile than the AXE.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son....it&#x27;s has a very light and clean smell.</li>
