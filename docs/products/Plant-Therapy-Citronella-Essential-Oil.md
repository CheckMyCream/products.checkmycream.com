    <li> Product as described.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Citronella Essential Oil. 30 ml (1 oz). 100% Pure, Undiluted, and mixed with Witch Hazel and placed blended mixture into a small spray bottle.  The overall order is an acquired scent but tolerable, could mix a small amount of lemon oil to mask it.  It does seem to work for me.  I sprayed my leg and mosquitoes did not attack me like before.  Some still tried, but not the hordes like before.</li>
    <li> I own many Plant Therapy essential oils and love each of them.  I had never ordered Citronella because the putrid scent of citronella candles makes me gag.  With all the rain my area has had this year, the mosquitoes are numerous and aggressive.  I ordered PTs citronella.  Wow.  It smells wonderful. I added lemon, tea tree, and peppermint essential oils to the citronella/oil mix.  Very effective mosquito repellent.</li>
    <li> Works wonders in candles</li>
    <li> I got this product for my pets, especially my horses.  A little goes a long way and its great for flys and gnats. I mix it in baby oil or sunflower oil, works fantastic and smells great too.</li>
    <li> Use to stop dag from peeing on the floor.</li>
    <li> I put this on the top of the shoes that I work outside it.  Far enough away from the nose to not be annoying yet 3-4 drops seems to keep most bugs and insects away.  Can also be diluted in other things to make a lotion that has anti insect repelling properties</li>
    <li> This product is great for repelling  mosquitos etc. I&#x27;ll buy it again when this one&#x27;s gone!</li>
