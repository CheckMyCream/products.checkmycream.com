### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best curler i have ever had!</li>
      <li>The finger grips are great!</li>
      <li>I think it looks great.  </li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>(Breaks easily)</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve changed the design and removed the curl tip that fit fingers so well and made it easy to hold on to</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for as I&#x27;m sure most of you are aware.</li>
      <li>The one I received was not the one pictured,  it was a cheap all metal one with no finger cushions.</li>
      <li>First things first - what is pictured here is NOT what I received.</li>
      <li>I guess I got away easy after reading several reviews that got their lashes hacked off!</li>
      <li>What I received looks absolutely nothing like I thought I ordered.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>i got a plain, cheap, all metal curler that broke within three days!</li>
      <li>Ripped out half my eyelashes the first use (and this isn&#x27;t my first time using eyelash curlers).</li>
      <li>I might try it out for myself on a wild weekend or something.</li>
      <li>exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to settle for an eye lash curler, go for the other &amp;#34;lesser&amp;#34; curlers like Revlon or pay a little more for a tweezerman.</li>
      <li>There were no thick handle pieces on it as the picture shows, just the normal metal you get with any typical eyelash curler.</li>

<li> It will last for a small amount of time if you are in a pinch, definitely, but at some point it will destroy your lashes.</li>
<li> Did not chop off my eyelashes like some of the other reviews...</li>
<li> Not cool at all.</li>
<li> sturdy and a black cushion not white that always looks dirty.  </li>
<li> I think the bottom rubber thingy is to hard.</li>
<li> The worst eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
<li> Worst eyelash curler</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> This thing ripped a bunch of my eyelashes out. I guess I got away easy after reading several reviews that got their lashes hacked off! This thing is garbage!</li>
    <li> What I received looks absolutely nothing like I thought I ordered. There handles do not look the same nor is the style the same. It is more difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I personally did not use this item.  I bought it for my wife.  So SHE gave it the 2-star rating.  I think it looks great.  I might try it out for myself on a wild weekend or something.</li>
    <li> Worst eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used. Ripped out half my eyelashes the first use (and this isn&#x27;t my first time using eyelash curlers).</li>
    <li> arrived different than picture</li>
    <li> wasnt the same as the one in the picture. i got a plain, cheap, all metal curler that broke within three days!</li>
    <li> It worked. But it is not very reliable. (Breaks easily)</li>
    <li> The one sent was not as pictured. They&#x27;ve changed the design and removed the curl tip that fit fingers so well and made it easy to hold on to</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well. I think the bottom rubber thingy is to hard.</li>
    <li> First things first - what is pictured here is NOT what I received. I received the standard cheapie version which I could have purchased @ Target. Not cool at all. The one I received works ok but I was looking forward to receiving what I actually paid for.</li>
    <li> Did not chop off my eyelashes like some of the other reviews... But did not curl my eyelashes at all. This product is a joke!</li>
    <li> very shoddily made- fell apart within the first week of usage.</li>
    <li> This curler is also super cheap in stores, but the other awful reviews are true: it cuts off your lashes. Just don&#x27;t. If you&#x27;re going to settle for an eye lash curler, go for the other &amp;#34;lesser&amp;#34; curlers like Revlon or pay a little more for a tweezerman. The worst eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used. It will last for a small amount of time if you are in a pinch, definitely, but at some point it will destroy your lashes. You get what you pay for as I&#x27;m sure most of you are aware.</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> This is the best curler i have ever had! sturdy and a black cushion not white that always looks dirty.  The finger grips are great!</li>
    <li> The one I received was not the one pictured,  it was a cheap all metal one with no finger cushions.</li>
    <li> What was advertised here was not what I received. There were no thick handle pieces on it as the picture shows, just the normal metal you get with any typical eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> Not the same as before, or as pictured. The plastic handles are gone, replaced with wire ones and the soft pads are also gone, replaced with harder ones. It&#x27;s now like one you might find at a drugstore.</li>
    <li> Works well. Recommend.... Especially for this price!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t now didn&#x27;t receive this received a different one</li>
