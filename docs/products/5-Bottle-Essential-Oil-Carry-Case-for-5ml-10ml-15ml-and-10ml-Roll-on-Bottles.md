      <li>Took on a trip &amp; it worked great!  </li>
      <li>These are great, they&#x27;re bulky so have room in your purse</li>
      <li>Have gotten many compliments on it!!</li>
      <li>Otherwise it is true to the color of the picture and for the price, the quality is good.</li>
      <li>but they keep your oils safe</li>
      <li>Which I&#x27;m sure over time will cause some wear.</li>
      <li>this carrying case is ok</li>
      <li>This pouch makes it easy for me to carry oils with me all the time.</li>
      <li>However, it functions fine.  </li>
      <li>but I know they are secure.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if some kind of stiffener was in the bottom portion to make the case stay flat when in your hand.</li>
      <li>A good case for essential oils</li>
      <li>I can throw this in my purse and always have my oils handy especially when traveling!</li>
      <li>a nice case that holds five oil bottles of various sizes (5 ml and 15 ml).</li>
      <li>Just the right size for my go to oils.</li>
      <li>Unless you carry a VERY large purse, I would not consider this purse-size.  </li>
      <li>Bottles are secure &amp; it fits all different sizes!</li>
      <li>The case is also a bit floppy, so when you open a full case in your hand, it tends to flop to one side or the other, so make sure your oils are secured in the elastics or they will roll out.</li>
      <li>Fabric is very cheap feeling and only slightly padded.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little flimsy, but holds the oils tight and fits perfect in the bottom of my small purse.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased the Coral with Black Interior to go in my purse and it is true to the picture.</li>

<li> its roughly the size of a sunglasses case.</li>

<li> , it&#x27;s just a little flimsy.</li>

    <li> My mom loves this to carry her essential oils! This came in red, not like the pink it shows.</li>
    <li> perfect size for tote or purse for on the go oils.  I kept these with me while going to meetings during the day and switched for a day of visiting.  I like to have some &amp;#34;must have oils&amp;#34; with me for daily needs.  [ex: Lemon to add to my drinking bottle, Lavender for emergencies, Thieves for cold/flu protection, stress away for relaxing, and ?oil that speaks to me that day]</li>
    <li> A good case for essential oils</li>
    <li> This pouch makes it easy for me to carry oils with me all the time.</li>
    <li> I recently used this to take our most-used DoTerra oils with us on vacation.It was great!</li>
    <li> This fabric was icky. I was expecting a woven nylon, and it is the type of synthetic fabric that would get fuzzy.</li>
    <li> Just the right size for my go to oils. I can throw this in my purse and always have my oils handy especially when traveling!</li>
    <li> For being a &amp;#34;purse&amp;#34; size this is a little bigger than I thought it would be.  However, it functions fine.  Some of my oil bottles are a little hard to maneuver in and out but I know they are secure.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality fabric.</li>

    <li> this carrying case is ok, it&#x27;s just a little flimsy. I am afraid if I was to drop it, all my oils would break.</li>
    <li> The color was darker than i thought it would be. But, it is a great case!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my purse. Have gotten many compliments on it!!</li>
    <li> Unless you carry a VERY large purse, I would not consider this purse-size.  Don&#x27;t know what I expected the size to be to carry 5 bottles but I can&#x27;t carry this in any of my purses.</li>
    <li> These are great, they&#x27;re bulky so have room in your purse or wherever you want to put them but they keep your oils safe</li>
    <li> I purchased the Coral with Black Interior to go in my purse and it is true to the picture. It fits well in my purse, however, if I were to have smaller purse, it would be too big..its roughly the size of a sunglasses case. It&#x27;s made well for the cost, the only reason I take away a star, is I purchased the 2ml oil bottles {Which are WAY too small for this carrier}; the lids tend to snag on the inside of the fabric. Which I&#x27;m sure over time will cause some wear. Otherwise it is true to the color of the picture and for the price, the quality is good.</li>
    <li> Took on a trip &amp; it worked great!  Bottles are secure &amp; it fits all different sizes!</li>
    <li> Fabric is very cheap feeling and only slightly padded. I don&#x27;t know how it would hold my oils because I literally repackaged it as soon as I felt the material. Returning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little flimsy, but holds the oils tight and fits perfect in the bottom of my small purse.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s what I needed.</li>
    <li> a nice case that holds five oil bottles of various sizes (5 ml and 15 ml). I had thought the fabric would be a little nicer - these are made out of a soft, fuzzy polyester feeling material, and I had thought it would be a smoother nylon feel. The case is also a bit floppy, so when you open a full case in your hand, it tends to flop to one side or the other, so make sure your oils are secured in the elastics or they will roll out. Or open on a flat surface. It would be nice if some kind of stiffener was in the bottom portion to make the case stay flat when in your hand. Overall it was inexpensive and works for what I need.</li>
