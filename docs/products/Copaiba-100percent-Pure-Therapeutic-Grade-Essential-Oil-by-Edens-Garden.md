      <li>Have not used this to much yet, but love Eden&#x27;s Garden products!</li>
      <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Copaiba is fast becoming one of my most-used oils to help me cope with fibromyalgia pain.</li>
      <li>And the delivery is very fast!</li>
      <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
      <li>Nice oil, nice scent - will be back for other products.</li>
      <li>This is my second order from Eden&#x27;s Garden, and I am just as happy this time as I was with the last order.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>It really does work</li>
      <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I take 6 drops of copaiba oil in a veggie capsule and I am able to run a full three miles with only a small amount of pain/stiffness in my knees toward the end.</li>
      <li>I love this particular oil because it can be blended with almost any other oil, and it magnifies the properties of the other oil without altering the scent.</li>
      <li>Did not feel or work like my young living copaiba oil...very disapointed</li>
      <li>In fact, I was pleasantly surprised that this was the 30ML bottle</li>
      <li>But beware to all  sensitive type of skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve just recently stated using eo&#x27;s and this one came highly recommended by a friend.</li>

<li> When taking Aleve, I couldn&#x27;t even make it half that distance before I felt enough pain that I had to walk.</li>

    <li> Love this product.  Helps with doggie incontinence.  Also calms her down.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Another quality oil from Eden&#x27;s Garden! You never have to worry about this company.</li>
    <li> Nice oil. Works well. All the oils I have purchased from this company have been very high quality.</li>
    <li> Great smell. I&#x27;ve been using it for inflammation in my shoulders and lower back. Even TMJ. Works great.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> This is my second order from Eden&#x27;s Garden, and I am just as happy this time as I was with the last order. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised that this was the 30ML bottle - I thought it was only 10ML, so the price was even better than I thought it was! Nice oil, nice scent - will be back for other products. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This oil helps get out knots and soothes aching joints. Will definitely buy again!! Great to do business with!!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and as described</li>
    <li> Worked as expected. Good price.</li>
    <li> Excellent Copaiba!  I&#x27;m using it in blends for it&#x27;s multiplying properties.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just recently stated using eo&#x27;s and this one came highly recommended by a friend. I hope it will work on my local joint pain and neuropathy as it did for my friend.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product at an outstanding price!! Delivery was prompt, and the catalog is well designed and informative. I also like this larger bottle.</li>
    <li> This works at least as well as prescription strength Aleve. I can measure this based on how well I can run. I was able to quit taking Aleve which I was happy about because I was getting bruises all over in addition to stomach discomfort from that. I take 6 drops of copaiba oil in a veggie capsule and I am able to run a full three miles with only a small amount of pain/stiffness in my knees toward the end. When taking Aleve, I couldn&#x27;t even make it half that distance before I felt enough pain that I had to walk. Also, I start to feel my joints ache in the afternoon, which tells me the oil was preventing that pain up until then. It really does work and I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great multi-purpose oil and safe for my dog also.</li>
    <li> Arrived just as promised. Used as addition to other oils for blends.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, JUST GET IT, GOOD QUALITY STUFF.</li>
    <li> Works great.  The price was very good and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Very, very good. I can trust using this product due to its quality. Copaiba is fast becoming one of my most-used oils to help me cope with fibromyalgia pain.</li>
    <li> Have not used this to much yet, but love Eden&#x27;s Garden products! Will continue using and enjoying the benefits of oils verses pills! Thank you</li>
    <li> very effective, using it on  my horses for muscle and joint work</li>
    <li> Works tremendously well for aches and pains!!</li>
    <li> Smells the same as the MLM EO. Works amazing!!</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for she suffers from a lot of foot and back. pain. This stuff works reduce&#x27;s her pain which allows her to sleep better at night.Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Relieves pain a little. But beware to all  sensitive type of skin</li>
    <li> Great product and price point. Seems to work as I expected it to.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as YL, but can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent Service;  Accurate Product Description</li>
    <li> Good for stress and using to enhance other essentials - very good quality</li>
    <li> LIKE IT . I use this oil to heal wounds. it is very good.</li>
    <li> I started to use this oil immediately after receiving it.  I bought it because I had read it helps with inflammation.  I have had trouble with my hands for years and I was hoping to get some relief.  It didn&#x27;t perform any miracles but it did bring the inflammation down. I could only apply it at night because my hands are always in water. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the performance of this essential oil.</li>
    <li> Great smell and good price.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I love all the essential oils I have gotten from Edens Garden. They are the company I order most of my oils from! And the delivery is very fast!</li>
    <li> Awesome quality!  I love this particular oil because it can be blended with almost any other oil, and it magnifies the properties of the other oil without altering the scent. Copaiba alone is great, ad well.</li>
    <li> It helps with the pain in my hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying it for pain, we will see.</li>
    <li> love putting this into my lotion</li>
