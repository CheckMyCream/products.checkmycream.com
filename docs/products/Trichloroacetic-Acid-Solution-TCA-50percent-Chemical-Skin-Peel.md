### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great!.</li>
      <li>so I find this on amazon and read all the great reviews</li>
      <li>works great.</li>
      <li>Very effective at removing sebhorreic keratosis</li>
      <li>This is an awesome product, I bought it to remove some light moles and freckles</li>
      <li>once it fell off I put alvera sap on it from a plant I own.</li>
      <li>It healed nicely.</li>
      <li>but I surely wasn&#x27;t expecting the amount/bottle to be so miniscule/small for $8 bucks.</li>
      <li>I think I would have been okay using the recommendations of others here on Amazon to apply with a toothpick.  </li>
      <li>healed up pretty nice &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure possibly after many treatments it will be effective in fading my tattoo which I look forward too.</li>
      <li>Very powerful.</li>
      <li>You may think that a toothpick wouldn’t transmit much acid, but I’m confident it would be more than adequate and that it would isolate the acid to the area that needs treated.  </li>
      <li>I applied the acid full strength in the morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>Honestly, it is probably wise to only let a professional use these products.</li>
      <li>Ask the giant freaking scar all over my arm if i liked the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to be able to buy this product, but BE ADVISED that the directions in the package to use a Q-tip are EXTREMELY harmful.  </li>
      <li>It looks like i dipped my right arm in fire.</li>
      <li>It would work better if it could be mixed with something so that it didn&#x27;t run.</li>
      <li>when you first out it on</li>
      <li>It did exactly what it was supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions to reapply for the first couple of days.  </li>
      <li>I think I may try a higher percentage solution and see what happens.</li>
      <li>I can see results, but it will take several more applications to really see a difference.</li>
      <li>used 1/2 of water and 1/2 of acid and applied gently for no more than 3 minutes depending on your skin, it will burn your skin very lightly it will turn brown for about 3 to 4 days, so I recommend doing it during weekends, my skin was really smooth after it peel, use sunblock to prevent any skin pigmentation.</li>
      <li>so you have to really youtube and research how to use it and stuff before applying on anything.</li>
      <li>Works very well, does take 2 applications depending on area.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really remove my scar tissue.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>So as of now,I don&#x27;t have much information to share with you.</li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone who struggling with a wart and the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>so it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
      <li>I think I added too much water</li>
      <li>I got carried away burning moles off over my whole body and will take responsibility for how widespread the damage is, but a Q-tip spreads the acid to a much wider area than is necessary, and much more burning than is necessary occurs.  </li>
      <li>, I highly recommend doing your homework before sticking acid on your skin.</li>
      <li>so I applied a little more using a Q-tip.  </li>
      <li>It does burn and the sting lasts several minutes but the result is worth it.</li>
      <li>i love it, in only 4 hours my wart disappeared , it was incredible.i recommend to everybody.just be careful because burn evrything around it</li>
      <li>I’m only grateful that I didn’t go to my face first.  </li>
      <li>I leave very few reviews, but one more voice of warning is merited in this case.  </li>
      <li>but since i didn&#x27;t keep applying it because its a hassle i didn&#x27;t completely get rid of it.</li>
      <li>Used for about 6 weeks and the very stubborn wart on my palm finally surrendered!</li>
      <li>I’ll be wearing long sleeves and not visiting the pool at least all summer (and perhaps I&#x27;ll never be able to take off my shirt again)</li>
      <li>very recommended but be very careful when handling and keep away from children</li>
      <li>But please be VERY careful its very strong,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t done much,but it&#x27;s only my third application.</li>

<li> So far it hasn&#x27;t done much,but it&#x27;s only my third application.</li>
<li> Exact same effect as Baby Foot but less messy</li>
<li> After doing my feet, I use the same cotton ball to apply to my elbow, but by Thursday nothing happened except very dry elbow</li>
<li> Initially bought Baby Foot Deep Exfoliation for Feet which work but at $25 for one application it was not economical for me.</li>
<li> Please be careful though</li>
<li> works, but be careful it leaves a burn mark which will take months to go away</li>
<li> Did as expected after two to three weeks of use the wart fell off.</li>
<li> For me this did not work because i have a bigger mole that is very round and has been there for a long time.</li>
<li> Frosted my skin, then it dried up, turned red, then dark reddish brown and scabby,  horrified anyone who saw me.</li>
<li> It says to dilute it, but I didn&#x27;t - I applied it to some dark spots on the back of my hand and on my temple, and a few small warts that grow on my nose/face .</li>
<li> A month later, I’m afraid I’m going to have long-term and profound scarring.  </li>
<li> Small areas don&#x27;t take much, be careful not to burn the surrounding area.</li>
<li> well I bought this because I have a skin tag on my arm pit for years since I was little.</li>
<li> The areas turned brown for a few days then</li>
<li> After applying a generous amount to my skin I felt nothing, it took atleast five plus minutes to finally feel a slight sting before feeling a little stronger stinging but definitely nothing too painful at all.</li>
<li> I have a thick scar from treatment about a year later, not a good idea</li>
<li> (Used a cotton ball to apply and let dry) and less expensive.  </li>
<li> Not sure what I was thinking when I ordered</li>
<li> No burning when applied to the bottom of the feet, but some stinging on the elbows.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the amount I used, there is at least 3 to 4 undiluted applications in the bottle.</li>
<li> because I have burns everywhere that make me look like I’ve got some terrible disease.  </li>

    <li> Works great!. It says to dilute it, but I didn&#x27;t - I applied it to some dark spots on the back of my hand and on my temple, and a few small warts that grow on my nose/face . It does burn and the sting lasts several minutes but the result is worth it. The areas turned brown for a few days then after it is peeled, the blemish peels off too. Vapors will irritate the eyes.</li>
    <li> Initially bought Baby Foot Deep Exfoliation for Feet which work but at $25 for one application it was not economical for me. Based on what I saw on Youtube, I decided that if it can do that to ones face it should work for the feet.  I Applied product undiluted to the bottom of my feet on Sunday and by Wednesday it started to peel.  Exact same effect as Baby Foot but less messy (Used a cotton ball to apply and let dry) and less expensive.  After doing my feet, I use the same cotton ball to apply to my elbow, but by Thursday nothing happened except very dry elbow so I applied a little more using a Q-tip.  PS. No burning when applied to the bottom of the feet, but some stinging on the elbows.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the amount I used, there is at least 3 to 4 undiluted applications in the bottle.</li>
    <li> worked for me and others ive used it on..very recommended but be very careful when handling and keep away from children</li>
    <li> Very powerful. It did exactly what it was supposed to do. Frosted my skin, then it dried up, turned red, then dark reddish brown and scabby,  horrified anyone who saw me. And then it peeled and left my skin soft and pink. It healed nicely. I can see results, but it will take several more applications to really see a difference.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really remove my scar tissue. it created scabs.</li>
    <li> I used 3 applications on each of my 3 tattoos al of which had no difference whatsoever... I think I may try a higher percentage solution and see what happens.</li>
    <li> well I bought this because I have a skin tag on my arm pit for years since I was little. It was an eye sore so I find this on amazon and read all the great reviews I but it on every morning and night it does burn a hole lot for like 5 mins but I got the results I wanted. once it fell off I put alvera sap on it from a plant I own. healed up pretty nice &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t done much,but it&#x27;s only my third application.So as of now,I don&#x27;t have much information to share with you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a tattoo that I had gotten over and it faded it but since i didn&#x27;t keep applying it because its a hassle i didn&#x27;t completely get rid of it. it does the job though. oh! and it does burn when you first out it on so you have to really youtube and research how to use it and stuff before applying on anything.</li>
    <li> i love it, in only 4 hours my wart disappeared , it was incredible.i recommend to everybody.just be careful because burn evrything around it</li>
    <li> Works very well, does take 2 applications depending on area. Small areas don&#x27;t take much, be careful not to burn the surrounding area.</li>
    <li> Ask the giant freaking scar all over my arm if i liked the product. It looks like i dipped my right arm in fire. All so, it hurt like hell.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I was thinking when I ordered but I surely wasn&#x27;t expecting the amount/bottle to be so miniscule/small for $8 bucks. Decided to test the product out before writing this review. I&#x27;m using the acid/50% strength to start the process of tattoo removal. After applying a generous amount to my skin I felt nothing, it took atleast five plus minutes to finally feel a slight sting before feeling a little stronger stinging but definitely nothing too painful at all. I&#x27;m sure possibly after many treatments it will be effective in fading my tattoo which I look forward too.</li>
    <li> This TCA solution can cause skin discoloration around the site of application. Honestly, it is probably wise to only let a professional use these products.</li>
    <li> It would work better if it could be mixed with something so that it didn&#x27;t run. Hope it doesn&#x27;t scarr</li>
    <li> For me this did not work because i have a bigger mole that is very round and has been there for a long time. Although when i used it. it did burn off skin from the outer layer. it does burn. so use baking soda.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised in about three weeks for mole removal. I applied the acid full strength in the morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt; Thanks.</li>
    <li> I think I added too much water so it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
    <li> Very effective at removing sebhorreic keratosis</li>
    <li> Works when directions are followed.</li>
    <li> When I read it&#x27;s potency, I got rid of it.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product, I bought it to remove some light moles and freckles I had. works great. But please be VERY careful its very strong,&lt;br /&gt;I used 1/2 of water and 1/2 of acid and applied gently for no more than 3 minutes depending on your skin, it will burn your skin very lightly it will turn brown for about 3 to 4 days, so I recommend doing it during weekends, my skin was really smooth after it peel, use sunblock to prevent any skin pigmentation.</li>
    <li> Used for about 6 weeks and the very stubborn wart on my palm finally surrendered! Please be careful though, I highly recommend doing your homework before sticking acid on your skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my mole??</li>
    <li> I leave very few reviews, but one more voice of warning is merited in this case.  I&#x27;m glad to be able to buy this product, but BE ADVISED that the directions in the package to use a Q-tip are EXTREMELY harmful.  I got carried away burning moles off over my whole body and will take responsibility for how widespread the damage is, but a Q-tip spreads the acid to a much wider area than is necessary, and much more burning than is necessary occurs.  I followed the directions to reapply for the first couple of days.  You don&#x27;t know what damage has been done for four or five days.  A month later, I’m afraid I’m going to have long-term and profound scarring.  I’m only grateful that I didn’t go to my face first.  I think I would have been okay using the recommendations of others here on Amazon to apply with a toothpick.  You may think that a toothpick wouldn’t transmit much acid, but I’m confident it would be more than adequate and that it would isolate the acid to the area that needs treated.  I would estimate that whatever area gets touched with the acid, between five and ten times that area around the point contacted gets burned away—I don’t think that’s an exaggeration.  I’ll be wearing long sleeves and not visiting the pool at least all summer (and perhaps I&#x27;ll never be able to take off my shirt again) because I have burns everywhere that make me look like I’ve got some terrible disease.  Learn from me.</li>
    <li> I have a thick scar from treatment about a year later, not a good idea</li>
    <li> Worked for getting rid of a skin tag and a mile and still have tons left!</li>
    <li> Did as expected after two to three weeks of use the wart fell off. I recommend it to anyone who struggling with a wart and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> works, but be careful it leaves a burn mark which will take months to go away</li>
