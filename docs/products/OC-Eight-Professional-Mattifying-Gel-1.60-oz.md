### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>my search for the perfect mattifying product is over!</li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>My husband and I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I just added the step of applying OC8 copiously to my T-zone (where I am most oily), and I&#x27;m set for the day!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I really love this product!</li>
      <li>This was my first time using this product and it works great!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>The first day I used it, I thought it was the best thing ever.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
      <li>I believe this is a very good product if you don&#x27;t have super oily skin</li>
      <li>This gel is amazing.</li>
      <li>The results were amazing.</li>
      <li>I took it with me to FL and it worked amazingly.</li>
      <li>but ... I couldn&#x27;t find anything more affordable and as good as this gel.</li>
      <li>So not a miracle worker, but a good product until something better</li>
      <li>But most of the time it does it&#x27;s job surprisingly well.</li>
      <li>It did provide a nice Mat looking layer to my skin for a longer duration of time.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between my skin when I wear OC Eight or not</li>
      <li>Once you walk away from the mirror feeling  nicely made-up  </li>
      <li>Let me give an honest review about this product.</li>
      <li>Sonia Kashuk&#x27;s mattifier from Target (which costs a fraction of what OC Eight costs) is much more effective and has a much superior texture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting more people looking at me longer and more heads turning lol.</li>
      <li>I really, honestly don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.</li>
      <li>Nice to be able to order on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This helped kind of, but I wasn&#x27;t in love with it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but is the most effective I have tried.</li>
      <li>I used this product for a full week and it did not work, not even for one hour!!</li>
      <li>It serves as a great foundation, smoothing my skin and filling in my large pores.</li>
      <li>love this product</li>
      <li>I am hoping it will meet my expectations over the winter/spring! :-)</li>
      <li>I had  to reapply more than it was stated that I would.</li>
      <li>but I wish it was more affordable.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>, you&#x27;ll not regret it, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why more people don&#x27;t know about this product.</li>
      <li>Target had run out, so I ordered OC and thought it would be even better -</li>
      <li>In it similar to what they use on oil spills, perfect for my catastrophically oily skin!!</li>
      <li>I was so pleased I found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>In warmer weather it works 8 or more hours for me</li>
      <li>I love love love it .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a top dermatologist in my city. Amazon sells it at nearly half at what I paid for it at a pharmacy. It does not make your skin dry it removes the oily shine which really makes one seem older and uncleam.</li>
    <li> works well when I put it over my moisturizer, keeps the shine away for most of the morning.</li>
    <li> As you might expect of someone using this product, I have pretty oily skin, and OC Eight controls the shine better than any other product I had tried (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything). The consistency of the product is, in part, what helps it works so well. And I have never had it cause a rash or create any other skin problems for me--even after I&#x27;ve been sweating. It offers an excellent undercoat to make-up (I use mineral-based powder and liquid only in spots, when needed). And more importantly, for long days, it does indeed last for eight hours, and does not dry the skin out in the process. Of equal importance is that it does not cause a pasty or filmy look (unless applied too thickly--be sure to blend at the jaw line, where it can sometimes leave a light residue), but it allows for your natural-looking glow. I really, honestly don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple, does not work. It is just like all those other mattifying products that simply don&#x27;t work and make your face feel even more digusting.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily, acne prone skin.  I discovered using a mattifier helps control the oil and somewhat prevent breakouts.  I was using Peter Thomas Roth mattifier and found it to help immensely.  I purchased the OC Eight and it works way better than PTR, the price is less expensive (especially when shopping on Amazon) and a little goes a long way so the tube lasts longer.  It also goes on well, not waxy or heavy feeling.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Product works well, really like it</li>
    <li> I was very expectant after I had read the reviews about this product but frankly if you have severely oily skin don&#x27;t bother buying this as it does nothing. Yes you will have a matte finish immediately after application but this lasts and hour maybe two at the most. My skin is very oily and this product didn&#x27;t help rid me of the shine.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this product to me for my oily skin.  I does just what I was told it would do.  I really like this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> this is like the 8th oil control product i&#x27;ve tried, still searching for the right one. this was also a disappointment. i had high hopes and was let down. it&#x27;s a generous size product and alot seems to go along way, but it just did not have any oil control.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says. Absorbs oil all day (and, as a bonus, improves skin texture). I don&#x27;t know where the oil goes - all I know is that this product is incredible. And I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
    <li> I never let myself run out of this stuff. It is the only stuff I have used on my oily skin that really does what it says without clogging my pores. It works all day and into the evening in colder weather. In warmer weather it works 8 or more hours for me and I have skin that is pretty oily. It is not like a typical mattifier in that it does not go on matte as you apply it, but it dries matte and stays that way. Makeup goes easily over it but , I don&#x27;t use liquid foundation, so I don&#x27;t know how well that would work. Powder foundation and bronzer work well. A little does go a long way or it might dry your skin out.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and although it does hold the oil off a little longer than if I hadn&#x27;t used it, I still find myself having to reapply about 4 hours later.  I think this product would work well if you had a mild case of oily skin, but if not, I wouldn&#x27;t bother purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I believe this is a very good product if you don&#x27;t have super oily skin like I have.  I purchased this in May when the humidity in Florida was still not very strong and at first I thought, wow, I finally found a product that works for me.  However, after one month, and back to 100% humidity, my oily skin has taken down this product.  It&#x27;s not even making a dent anymore.  In fact, it seems that using the product has exacerbated the break-out problem on the forehead now.  I have since stopped using it or only use it when I am out for just a few hours in the evening.  It definitely will work for people with lightly oily skin or those living in drier climates.  But I wished I could report that it will work for those of us cursed with super oily skin...because it does not.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Clinac OC for helping make my face look less oily.  OC Eight is the next generation version of Clinac OC so I was excited to get it.  I never used the original so I didn&#x27;t have much to compare to, but $40 later and my skin is just as oily as it was before.  I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between my skin when I wear OC Eight or not, it doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my skin.  So, I guess I fall into the category of people with extremely oily skin so this product does not work for me at all.  I will not be purchasing OC Eight again, it does not live up to expectations.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent and the price was $5 cheaper than where I was buying it before.</li>
    <li> At First I did not think OC Eight worked-then I read a review on Amazon about putting it on thicker and allowing it to dry. I did that and it made a HUGE difference. Powder make up and Liquid Make up go on nice and smooth afterwards. Didnt have to touch up my skin all day- NO OIL. This is a miracle.  I love this product and I am just sad I did not find it sooner. I will alway stay stocked up on this essential product. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT- !!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very oily face. I have tried different types of anti-shine, overall it is not the best. However, it blends well with my make up compare to smash box which is very good, but does not blend well with my foundation.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different oil control products.  My skin is so oily I could solve the nation&#x27;s energy problems just with my facial oil alone.  I used this product when it was called Clinac OC, but then they reformulated it slighly and called it OC Eight.  For a few years after they discontinued the old product before they came out with the new product, I tried everything else possible.  Nothing worked nearly as well as Clinac OC, so I was very happy they came out with the new version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who say it&#x27;s not working, I am wondering if you are not putting it on thick enough.  I have to put it on very thick, but then again, I don&#x27;t put on anything like makeup over that (since I&#x27;m a guy).  Maybe try putting it on thicker and see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I also don&#x27;t put it on all over my face - just my forehead and nose, where it&#x27;s the oiliest.  Then I put it on thick, and it lasts all day, even into the evening.</li>
    <li> I invented oily skin. I write that to try and emphasize my problem skin. OC Eight is the ONLY product I have used (that includes Mary Kay mattifier) that keeps my oil-free sunscreen and foundation DRY on my face and in place. Forget powder, doesn&#x27;t do a thing. I apply sunscreen/foundation first, then put on the OC Eight. Without OC Eight, ten minutes after I step outside of my house and get in my car to go to work, my sunscreen/foundation is coming off of my face with oil shine and sweat. Do not expect this product to work if you only use a tiny drop.  Your dermatologist may try to excuse the cost by saying \\&quot;you barely need a drop\\&quot; but that is not the case.  3-4 pearl-sized drops patted onto your face are what is needed. You will need to re-apply half-way through the day. What makeup product does not need a little re-application throughout the day? Do not expect to put this on and have it keep the oil and sweat away if you go tubing, play golf in the heat, or go to an outdoor daytime concert in the heat.  This is a good product, not a miracle, be reasonable in your expectations. Also, this is not an acne product. It will not cure acne. But you can have a good, shine-free look that lasts.</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY oily skin. I&#x27;ve been searching for a mattifyer that actually works for my overactive oil glands. This doesn&#x27;t work for me. After a couple of hours, I&#x27;m shining like usual. Previous to OC8, I was using Avon Majix. IMHO, OC8 works the same as the Majix. I was hoping for a stronger product, but I guess my skin is just too oily for them all! Maybe it will work for those with slightly oily skin. I won&#x27;t purchase it again, because of the price. I can get Avon&#x27;s product on sale.</li>
    <li> It was okay. This isn&#x27;t the miracle product I was hoping for. My face still gets oily and gross after a few hours. A light dusting of baby powder works a thousand times better to reduce shine.</li>
    <li> The only product that&#x27;s ever worked to mattify my forehead. I&#x27;ve tried others that claim to take away the shine but none of them have ever worked the way OC8 works.</li>
    <li> As a teenager I have struggled with oily skin for many years. I had tried everything, washes, gels, even other products like this one. However, most of them did not work, because things like washes only remove the oil that&#x27;s on your skin at that time. With this is actively sequesters the oil your body is producing, and does it better than any other product that I&#x27;ve tried, even the DermaDoctor Tease Zone Oil Control Gel. With this I no longer have to make a trip to the bathroom after every class and use blotting papers. While it doesn&#x27;t last forever, this product lasts the longest, and I no longer have people asking me if I&#x27;m sweating because my skin is so oily, and it also doesn&#x27;t clog your pores, dry out your skin, and even evens out the skin tone and reduces pore visibility. OC Eight really has changed my life, and I hope they continue to make it for a very long time and would recommend it to anyone who has a problem with oily skin to at least give it a try. If your skin is so oily that this doesn&#x27;t work well for you, bearing in mind it only works for about 6-8 hours, I&#x27;d recommend seeing a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Doesn&#x27;t work.  My face is still extremely oily after I apply the gel.  Definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> i have struggled with oily skin since high school. i have used every astringent , mask , powder known to man. i googled oily skin and looked for products and i saw this one on web md. i figured what the heck-its 35 bucks and i&#x27;ll see if it works. well today was my first day and i am super pleased with the results. usually i have to pat my self down every 10 minutes but this has worked for at least 8 hours . i highly reccomend this.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t find it helpful with oilyness</li>
    <li> I have had oily skin all my life and now as a middle aged woman living in the south, it is worse than ever.  I have tried many products only to waste my money.  My dr. told me about this product years ago and I never tried it.  Now I will never stop using it.  It is unbelievable!  Just make sure you let it set a few minutes before applying makeup.  Even when I&#x27;m out in the heat, it does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> I Was recommended to use this product by my dermatologist and was told it has a product In it similar to what they use on oil spills, perfect for my catastrophically oily skin!! I love it and it keeps my face feeling crisp and fresh</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin.  This helped kind of, but I wasn&#x27;t in love with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the recommendation of a dermatologist.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of products to combat my oily skin.  I had high hopes for this but was highly disappointed.  Bottom line, it doesn&#x27;t work.  I was just as oily in an hour or so...no difference if I hadn&#x27;t used it at all.  I will still continue my search for a product that works.</li>
    <li> Well, it still doesn&#x27;t keep me from being greasy. But, it helps a little. I know the reviews said to make a thick layer and let it dry, but I still have an oily forehead after.</li>
    <li> Finally a primer/mattifier that works for more than a couple of hours. I normally have breakthrough oil within 2 hours of putting on oil-free make-up. Today, it lasted 6 hours and the shine was much less than normal when I finally saw it. Agree with a previous reviewer who said to use a decent amount and let it sink in and set before you put make-up on. I read that this is the only mattifier that doesn&#x27;t interfere with sunscreen, so that&#x27;s a huge bonus too....</li>
    <li> I have used O C Eight for years. Cannot dress my face without it.  My skin never breaks out or gets oily anymore.</li>
    <li> So, if you&#x27;ve got oily skin, you&#x27;re pretty much stuck with it forever. OC8 makes the oil slick somewhat bearable. I still get oily 8 hours later, but maybe 50% better than I would be otherwise. This makes for a decent primer under makeup and it makes the complexion a little less ruddy too.</li>
    <li> So I am one of those people that could put oil derricks on their face. I am OILY! I was always looking greasy within what seemed to be minutes after starting my day. I have tried every trick of the trade and product under the sun. I even started asking in the womens cosmetics departments for items that I could use..because there just wasn&#x27;t something for men out there. Well I am now happy to report I have found the holy grail of oil control. This product is a life saver. It goes on smooth, next to no scent, lasts all day long, helps control the oil and my skin tone is also relatively evened out.  I was out with friends the other night, and all my friends wives were asking me how my skin looked so good. They wanted my secret...haha. Well ladies..and gents..this is the secret. Use it, and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I was told by my dermatologist that this product was a must-have for my oily skin.  I was so excited for this product to show up and man, I haven&#x27;t been this let down since I found out Butterbeer was non alcoholic.  First off, the bottle is extremely small for what you pay.  That was a major bummer, and my first day using the stuff under a thin layer of foundation yielded no results what-so-ever.  So i went along with what the message boards said and slathered it on thick.  Hoping a thicker application was the answer, it was so disappointing to see that I was greasy again almost immediately.  This product did NOT leave a matte finish, it did NOT reduce shine and in no way did it help hold my makeup in place for an 8 hour work day.  If you are thinking this will be the miracle product that its price-tag suggests, im sorry to say this wasn&#x27;t worth the paper box it came in.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous product. It has really helped me control my oily skin. I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Let me give an honest review about this product. I for one, have EXTREMELY oily skin. I have tried every medication (prescription and over the counter) under the sun. I&#x27;ve always had acne and oily face problems since I was 13 (now 23) and have not found a single product that works. after applying all of my medications in the morning before work, it only takes about 2-3 hours before you start to see little oily droplets form on my face. This product did help a little bit. It did provide a nice Mat looking layer to my skin for a longer duration of time. Although it makes you wonder, where does all that oil go? I am not convinced that it completely helped though. Although it may keep my skin looking less oily longer. It feels like that since the oil has nowhere to go, it stays clogged in my face and acne starts to form. Large, red almost cystic size bumps begin to form after I use this product. I have to use it in moderation. Or on special occasions only because of this. Anyway, if you have a little bit of a glow, this product will rock your world. If you have extremely oily skin like myself, there&#x27;s a 30-70 chance that it might help.</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t bother writing reviews, but I want to make sure this product keeps being sold so they never discontinue it! I&#x27;ve used OC everyday for a few weeks. It started working for me day 1 and hasn&#x27;t stopped working. I have some pretty oily skin. Generally by the end of a work day my face would be shiny and in desperate need of a wash. However, after using OC in the morning, I can wait until my shower the next morning to cleanse.  I think this has helped repair my acid mantle and skin&#x27;s natural balance because I&#x27;m not washing as frequently. Overall, my skin has seen improvements.</li>
    <li> I have horribly oily skin. Just use about a pea size on your finger and layer it thickly on the t zone just to the side of the nose and spread it out and around your cheek, but leave it heavy by the nose. No globs of it though, just a thicker layer at the nose and thin on the rest of the face. This will work best. Repeat on the other side. It takes like 45 min to dry though so be patient. Its worth it trust me. It lasts me longer than 8 hours doing it this way. If you comment on it and need help i&#x27;ll write you back.</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin and decided to buy this product after researching all the oil control products out there.  This product works well for about 2 hours and then you need to reapply.  I find it works best by itself.  When I add makeup on top it seems to only work for about an hour.  I was really disapponted and considering the cost for a small bottle it&#x27;s really not worth it.  It says that the longer you use it the better it will work so I am hoping that it will start to work longer with continued use.  Don&#x27;t think I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!!  It definitely helps with shine but doesn&#x27;t make my skin too dry like some mattifying creams.  It&#x27;s lightweight and great over my moisturizer and under my makeup.  highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used this product for a full week and it did not work, not even for one hour!!</li>
    <li> Wish it could last more than 8 hours.  I have purchased before and it lasts a long time.  Overall I would recommend and will purchase again.!!!</li>
    <li> The product did help as far as diminishing the appearance of oil, but I don&#x27;t think I can wear this product.  I put this on prior to my foundation and it makes my foundation appear much lighter than what it should be.  For that reason, I can&#x27;t wear the product.  Something that is translucent would work better for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a teenager on the advice of a dermatologist. The results were amazing. It worked much better than other big name products on the market!</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this works pretty well for me in controlling shine and making my foundation last much longer. I don&#x27;t stay completely matte all day or 8 hours, but it works better than most other primers. I will continue to buy this... It&#x27;s better than most of the others I have spent a fortune on.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It was recommended by my dermatologist to control shine without covering up the natural skin texture/tone. It leaves a silky soft, lightly powdery feel to the skin.  Unfortunately, I have yet, to figure out how to apply it without it creating white patches of product on my face. Too little does nothing for the shine. Too much creates these white patches that appear over time. Clear evidence that you haven&#x27;t applied it smoothly. Once you walk away from the mirror feeling  nicely made-up  you catch a glimpse of yourself an hour later and there are these little white patches of poorly distributed product. Makes me self conscious. I&#x27;m not a vain person, and I hate having to look in the mirror to check for patches constantly. Therefore, I&#x27;m less inclined to use this product. I tend to have an oily T-zone and getting this application smooth without white lines eventually appearing is a dilemma.</li>
    <li> I have the mother of all PCOS-hyperoily complexions.  I have purchased every mattifier I could find, and they all end up in the trash.  Except this one.  Now, I won&#x27;t claim that it perfected my skin and that it was pristine till midnight; but I can now go until noon without having to sop up the oil with a kleenex.  I actually made it to the end of the work day ... mildly oily, mildly shiny, but a huge improvement from my natural state.  I don&#x27;t use foundation, just a sun-block powder over the OC8 and a little blush.  Tah-dah.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I hate that there are so many cancer causing ingredients in here, and I feel like a huge hypocrite using it.  But it works.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, only on long/important/hot days, and I immediately wash my face as soon as I get home.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has worked to combat my oily skin. It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I have spent some much time looking for something like this. I am glad I have finally found something that worked for me</li>
    <li> Meh....I have better luck with Urban Decay&#x27;s Makeup Setting Spray.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Better than other products I have tried in the past.  Thank you.  Comment is finished. Finished Finished. Done.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I have had extremely oily skin since I was 15 and always thought the only solution would be to blot my face with paper towels every few hours.  And then I found Dermadoctor Tease Zone around my freshman year of college, and I thought it was really expensive but I was desperate to find a solution for my oily skin problem.  It did work, but eventually stopped being as effective as it used to be when I first started using it.  I used that product for about 4-5 years until I saw this product.  OC Eight did a great job because this stuff really does work, even better than Dermadoctor which I thought was decent.  Like the other reviewers have already stated, you need to lay this stuff on thick (aka, don&#x27;t rub it in your skin until you feel that it is dry.  Put a liberal amount on your finger tips and rub it on your face evenly for only a few seconds and stop - it will still feel a little \\&quot;moist\\&quot; against your skin.  Just let it sit on your skin until it dries by itself.)  Also, contrary to the other reviewers, I did NOT find that this product made me break out in cystic acne or any acne for that matter (and my skin is super acne-prone - if I lean my face against my hand for more than a few minutes, or if I wear a collared shirt that rubs against my neck the duration that I&#x27;m wearing the shirt, even for only a few hours, I will break out by the next morning).  All-in-all, this is a great product that works and is cheaper than Dermadoctor (for about the same amount of product)!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase.</li>
    <li> After searching for years for the perfect mattifying lotion I stumbled upon this one and love it dearly, whether alone or under makeup it does its said job.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will do in that it mattifies, however, it has not lasted more that three hours for me.  Perhaps I should I apply more generously.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s extremely good to keep the make-up flawless. It gives my face a dry and fresh look even under humid/hot weather conditions. It lasts for several hours (like 4-5).</li>
    <li> I got a sample from Birchbox a while back, finally used it (twice), and decided it did help some to control my oily skin, so I purchased the full product from Amazon. Though the product arrived promptly, I would have to say that it was not the best decision on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you get past the weird smell this lotion has, you will after 4 days notice that this product is giving you weird breakouts you didn&#x27;t have before. Tend to be tiny little white blisters that surface on your t-zone. I wash my face thoroughly every night and it didn&#x27;t stop the breakouts from coming. The only way to get around this is to apply less of it, but then it doesn&#x27;t control the shine as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to oil control, the effect wears off. The first 3-4 hours were oil-free, but throughout the day you find an extreme shine on your skin that not even your regular powder could cover up. By 8PM (and especially if I sweated during a workout), I am so bright like a disco ball I have to completely wash my face and reply my makeup to get rid of the shine. I feel like it just delays the shine until it ALL comes out at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this product to work, but it just did not have resilience.</li>
    <li> My husband and I absolutely love this stuff! It keeps your face from getting oily all day long! It was recommended by my dermatologist and before buying it I tried other subpar products that didn&#x27;t work...thus stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample and couldn&#x27;t wait to order it!  I was so pleased I found it on Amazon.  This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found to help 50 plus skin looks more radiant!  This product will now be a staple in my make-up routine!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin.  For years, I used prescription strength benzoyl peroxide on my face to control oil.  Not only would I still get oily, but it irritated my face from so much use.  This produce works just as well in controlling oil, but it&#x27;s gentle and works as a primer under any powder coverage.  It&#x27;s supposed to mattify for 8 hours.  On me, it lasts only a couple.  That&#x27;s not any worse than the Rx&#x27;s I was using.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a 26 year old guy who&#x27;s always struggled with oily skin and the occasional acne breakout. Well if oilines is the issue of acne, then buy something that hinders oil production right? So I went searching and found this. While it doesn&#x27;t work for a full 8 hours, it DOES seem to stop shine for a few hours and I don&#x27;t feel like overhead lighting is making me a reflector bouning the light into people&#x27;s eyes anymore. I didn&#x27;t rate this a full 5 stars because for some reason, it&#x27;s making me break out where I apply it (primarily on my forehead) I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now in hopes my skin just had to get used to the oil from being stopped or whatever it does but I&#x27;m worried that something in the ingredient list just isn&#x27;t jiving with my skin or just not letting it breathe the way it&#x27;s intended to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought the other one which has 7% benzoyl peroxide in hopes that it does what this one does for shine, but also combats the acne with the BP. Guess we&#x27;ll see, wish me luck!</li>
    <li> The OC Eight Professional Mattifying Gel reduced the shine on my face from morning to that afternoon.  It feels great on my skin.  It smoothed the appearance of my skin so well that i didn&#x27;t even use makeup foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product</li>
    <li> Works for a good 6 hours at least even with very oily skin,no white residue.Just reapply if you need a touch up.</li>
    <li> Packaging changed and doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent shine like previous purchased. So disappointed I stopped using. Don&#x27;t know if something changed when the packaging changed. Results were not satisfactory to me. Will not buy again unfortunately. Would like to find a replacement.</li>
    <li> I had no improvement on my skin or texture this product made me break out ladies and gentlemen if you want a product that works well I would try acutain or a natural product like lemon or milk</li>
    <li> I have tried to find a product like this for years.  I am extremely oily and my dermatologist recommended it.  As per other reviews,  I apply generously and wait about 5-10 minutes until I apply make-up.  I also use it to eliminate the shine when I&#x27;m not wearing make-up.  In the past, other products have caused break-outs.  I think this product has actually helped control the acne.  A great find!!!</li>
    <li> It does just what it claims to do.  Leaves a more matt finish, reduces shine and seems to keep my makeup looking fresher for longer.</li>
    <li> this product helped control the shine on my face.. but still i have to reapply in the afternoon because i have really oily T-zone..</li>
    <li> This gel is amazing. I have very oily skin and this leaves my face shine free from the morning to the time I get home. I always put on underneath my make up. I can barely feel it. I&#x27;ve been buying it regularly and will continue doing so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying online at amazon and ebay now for several years.  The items are usually what they say they are and what I expect, but nothing that is so outstanding that I had to write about it. I  recently traveled to Florida and I was really worried about the humidity and what my makeup would look like after a few hours. My sister gave me the remainder of a used tube of the OC Eight mattifying gel to use and take back home as she had another brand new one.  All I could say after using it a couple of days was...wow!  This stuff is great.  I use Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay long wearing liquid foundation, but it still never lasts as long as advertised until I used the OC Eight with it.  I even went swimming and it seemed to make my makeup nearly waterproof.  I tend to be self-conscious about my concealer and foundation staying on because I have a some darker pigmented spots on my face due to acne scarring as I have darker ethnic skin.  I wear it a little heavier than most because I want good coverage, but no matter what brand I use it always seemes to fade or \\&quot;melt-off\\&quot; in my oilier T-zones, requiring a lot of blotting and powdering during the day, but losing that fresh morning, just applied look by the end of the day.  This was not a worry with the OC Eight, even during my trip to hot, humid Florida.  I will buy my refills online here. $35 is worth it considering how much I&#x27;ve spent on cosmetics, especially if this stuff makes my regular makeup look that much better! Yay!</li>
    <li> I am a forty year old woman with very oily skin.  I have tried the smashbox and Dermadoctor versions of this, and I think this is the best.  It doesn&#x27;t go white at the edges like the Smashbox, and doesn&#x27;t pill with makeup over like the Dermadoctor.  It lasts for a couple of hours, then my skin shows the shine again.  So not a miracle worker, but a good product until something better (hopefully) gets invented to make my oily skin go away!</li>
    <li> I bought this originally from Rite Aid (after the pharmacist ordered it for me) after my dermatologist recommended this. My skin has been super oily and acne prone the past few years due to a hormone imbalance. After I stopped taking birth control and an antibiotic for my skin, my acne really flared up and even though I&#x27;m 28, this is the worst it has ever been. I have gone through several prescription topicals including retinoids and Epi-Duo and this has done more for my acne than any of them. Without this product, I end up with nasty &amp;#34;oil plugs&amp;#34; all over my skin after only a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I simply use my retinoid at night (and I sometimes put this on top of it when my skin gets really oily) after using a gentle cleanser and sometimes my Oil of Olay brush cleanser (similar to the Clarisonic one) and wash my face thoroughly for about 4-5 minutes. In the morning, I clean my skin again with a gentle cleanser cleanser for 4-5 minutes. After cleansing, I put 10% benzoyl peroxide cream all over my skin (I have bought the generic brand of this at Target and other places for less than $5 a tube) and sometimes Cerave moisturizer. I let this dry for a few minutes and then put a pea size amount of OC8 over it. After the OC8 dries for a minute or two, I then put on my oil-free make up.</li>
    <li> Please stop selling the old version in the white box with the dark blue lettering.  The packaging and tube changed some time ago.  I noticed a marked difference in how my foundation settled with this older version. I called my dermatologist, who originally recommended this to me as I have very oily and sensitive skin. She said she does not recommend using the older version due to performance.  She said a vendor should only be selling the product with the current light blue packaging, not the white.  There has not been a drastic change to the formula, but shelf-life and how long this old version has been sitting around shoud be questioned.  The old box says &amp;#34; Rev 07/06&amp;#34;. The newer light bue version says &amp;#34;Rev 01/12&amp;#34;. My skin is so oily I have to a prescribed anti-androgen med to reduce sebum production. I have tried every natural and  high end primer and oil control product there is.  I love this stuff...it is the ony primer that works for mebut only when I receive the most current one.  I wi be requesting a refund and ordering from another vendor.Please excuse any typing errors.  I am emotionaly bereft.  I needed this before going on a business trip</li>
    <li> I have to stand with a hair dryer blowing in my face for 3-4 minutes to get the stuff to dry, which is a drag when I&#x27;m trying to get out the door in the AM - but it does work! Keeps my skin matte til the end of the work day when normally my chin would be shiny and my makeup starting to disappear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year now. It is wonderful.  Use to be by lunch I&#x27;d feel like I had to wash my face.  Now I go the entire day without my face feeling and looking oily.  It last 8-10 hours for me.  If I have a day were I am out in humidity all day long, it doesn&#x27;t last as long.  It is still way better than it use to be, I can&#x27;t expect perfection in extreme weather. This is a must part of my everyday routine. Like other posters have stated, make sure you put on thick and let it dry otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in great time and the product itself is amazing. I live in GA so this really helps with the shine. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Works very well, I have used this before and was surprised how well it worked. The way to use this product is to apply a very small amount to the areas you typically get shiny. Clean and dried skin, when you apply this just use a small amount, but do not rub in til it is completly absorbed, other wise it will just kind off just peel off on to your finger tips. Stop rubbing in just before it is completely absorbed then just allow it to absorb in and dry. A sales rep for the company that makes this stuff told me this was how it was to be applied. When dried then apply your makeup as normal. We use to sell this stuff in one of the offices that I worked at to men to apply to thier heads (bald) and this helped to keep the shine away. You don&#x27;t need to apply makeup if you don&#x27;t want to and just go natural or just alittle powder. Now this will work during a normal work day but if you are in an extremely hot environment you may have to dab areas to reduce the shine. Don&#x27;t rub, just tap because then you wipe everything off. This does not prevent the oils in your skin but it does reduce the shine of oily skin. Also you do need to wash your skin well after to avoid clogging your pores and help prevent break outs.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best on the market for controlling oily skin.  I apply it each morning AFTER I have put on my make up and it absorbs oil and controls shine for the entire rest of the day.  I don&#x27;t have to reapply it during the day and I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying powder during the day to control the oil and shine. I can&#x27;t live without this product!  If you battle with oily skin and are looking for a solution that really works, this product is it.</li>
    <li> I have super oily skin and had high hopes for this product.  My dermatologist gave me a sample of this and I used it very sparingly to make it last as long as possible to get a good idea of how well it worked.  I thought this was the miracle I had hoped for.  I put on a very thin layer of the sample each day and my skin didn&#x27;t get shiny at all until the end of the day.  Then it was only a little bit shiny.  I was hooked so I ordered the full size version.  I feel like I fell for the old bait and switch.  Since I received the full size product I&#x27;ve applied it in a thin layer like I did the sample but it only controlled the oil for a couple of hours.  I tried putting on a thicker layer and that didn&#x27;t work either.  It is better than using nothing but not worth the price for as little as it does for me.  I guess my search continues.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  It has made a huge difference in how long I can go during the day without touching up my makeup.  I have very oily skin.  I was disappointed, however, with the seller on my recent order.  I noticed the tube and packaging looked different this time.  When I looked closer, I saw that I had received an older formulation of the product.  My current tube has a date of 2012 on it.  The tube I just received has a date of 2006.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, so I don&#x27;t know if it will work as well.  Hopefully, so.  I don&#x27;t like receiving old stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Seller contacted me after my review and did everything possible to make me happy with my purchase.  He ended up sending me what I asked for, the updated version of the product, for free, without having to send back the older one.  I really appreciated the lengths this seller went to in order to make me a satisfied customer.  My original rating was 3 stars.  I upgraded it to 5 stars based on the seller&#x27;s response to my concerns and his sending me the version of the product I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many alleged mattifying, oil control products and other than a discontinued Lancôme product this is the only one that ever worked as described and intended. Very little goes a LONG way and oil control lasts all day. I have sensitive skin and experienced no adverse reaction from this product. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Does not work for the claimed 8 hours, in my experience anyways. I have really oily skin (need to blot my face every 2 hours) and this product was not very effective. However, your experience may vary.</li>
    <li> This product made me break out like crazy. I woke up with my face covered in little white pimples and I freaked out.  I stopped using this for 9 days and then my face finally went back to normal.</li>
    <li> My face was as oily after I used it as it was before.  I saw no difference. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have overly oily skin so I figured this would definitely work for me. Not so. I have not noticed any difference after experimenting with it over the last few weeks. I&#x27;ve tried it over and under just about every product I could put on my face, with the same result. My face is no longer matte within a matter of a couple of hours. Just as if I hadn&#x27;t worn it at all. No biggie if I had only wasted a few dollars, but at $30+ I feel ripped off. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great product controls oil but not 8 hours more like 4. Definitely need to put on more than a dime size amount.</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with the product but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  There are only two products that I have found that truly worked for my oily face but neither one are available any longer.  Wish I had known those products were being discontinued because I would have stocked up big time!</li>
    <li> This gel works great on my nose to keep my glasses from amassing oils and sliding down.</li>
    <li> I like the way face looks right after gel is applied...you have to apply and let dry for a few minutes before applying makeup. Matte finish does not last but maybe 3 hours and face is shining again. Product was kind of pricey to only last for 3 hours. I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering this again :(</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m a male in my late 30s, and I&#x27;ve been having oily face on my forehead and nose area since high school.  I kept on having to wash my face every now and then. Didn&#x27;t know anything about mattifying gel until recently.  There were many products to choose from, but decided to go with OC8 because of the high positive reviews.  It works wonder. I only apply a little after I wash my face in the morning before going to work. It goes on wet when you first put it on but will become matte after a few minutes. My face remains matte even after I get home from work. That&#x27;s eight hours.  I love this product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Mattifies but smells icky.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, as I have struggled with extremely oily skin since I was twelve years old (I am 55).  My dermatologist recommended this and I was happy to pay the $40 if it would work.  An hour after applying it, I had the usual oily breakthrough, and I saw no difference at all throughout the day.  Sorry--another disappointing waste of money in the never ending quest for help with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product upon recommendation of my dermatologist. I took it with me to FL and it worked amazingly. As long as I put on a thicker layer, I was able to maintain my matte look all day long.  Do no hesitate to get this. It really works!</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY oily, acne-prone skin. I can say that even after I wash my face, my skin starts to get oily only after 5-10 minutes. I have very large pores as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was trying to find a solution to make sure that my face was not so oily, I came across this product. I ordered it, and it actually worked for me. It obviously does not work for 8 hours for me, but maybe only 2-4 hours MAX. But with just a couple pats of my oil sheets that I always have in my pocket, my face is again free of oil for at least a couple hours. I think what happens is that the oil seeps through the OC Eight mattifier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using OC Eight for probably over 1-1/2 years now. I wish I had it earlier, but only found it then. I don&#x27;t even want to talk about my face from before I started using OC Eight. My face was always oily and shiny every day of my life, with the constant uses of my oil sheets, which I always run out of each 50 pack within just a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE THING that I am grateful for is that this OC Eight Mattifier DOES NOT break me out or make me get more acne. So that was a big PLUS when I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still trying to find something that works even better than this OC Eight, but I haven&#x27;t found anything yet. I will probably continue to buy OC Eight for the rest of my life, or until my face stops producing so much oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product. Even if it doesn&#x27;t work for the 8 hours for me, I am just glad it works.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me to help control my oily skin. I love this product! Just a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t be put off by the price. It serves as a great foundation, smoothing my skin and filling in my large pores. It also works, as expected, to control oiliness. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Pricey - but it works and you get good spreadability.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as good as I needed. I had  to reapply more than it was stated that I would. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
    <li> I am sorry but this did not work for me.  I am African American with super oily skin.  I have tried Cliniques&#x27; Pore Perfecter &amp; it works great with controlling shine &amp; blurring pores!!!</li>
    <li> My face is very oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a lot of products, the effect is not very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is the best  which in all of product i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your face is very oily, i suggest you to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to a little bit expensive, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin, this is for you!</li>
    <li> I guess it depends on the person. However, this is so not worth the money. For me, it looked as though it made my skin oilier. I found another product which was much cheaper and worked extremely well..</li>
    <li> This product does not work for me.  I have oily skin and after applying makeup this prodct does not even last an hour.</li>
    <li> I live in the most humid part of America.  I used to use a wonderful Lancome product until it was discontinued.  This is the only other thing I have found that works - and it works well.  The key is, you have to let it dry on your face before putting on your foundation.  Put on sunscreen first, then OC Eight, let it dry, then anything else and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> Works but I did need to reapply throughout day.</li>
    <li> This product really did work well. Honestly it would keep me matte for even over 12 hours!! However, 4 or 5 days after starting use I got a couple of breakouts. I knew it had to be this because I hadn&#x27;t changed anything else I was putting on my face. So, I&#x27;ll give it 2 stars because at least it did keep me matte but I&#x27;ll never use it again.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when my dermatologist recommended OC8 to me. I&#x27;ve had very oily skin my whole life. It has become normal for me to carry packs of oil blotting sheets and separate compacts in every purse/backpack I own. I&#x27;ve tried countless other products from department stores and drug stores that have promised to put an end to my excessive oil, but they&#x27;ve all failed...except OC8!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been so pleased with a particular product. I didn&#x27;t have to change my routine at all. I just added the step of applying OC8 copiously to my T-zone (where I am most oily), and I&#x27;m set for the day! I didn&#x27;t once have to pull out my compact or oil blotting sheets. I am so pleased and will buy this product again and again. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I wear it everyday right out of the shower, keeps my skin matte but not dry looking. Wear it with or without makeup.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find that this helps me at all. I&#x27;m more oily than the Gulf and this didn&#x27;t do much to help that.</li>
    <li> In the past I would always have to use oil blotting pads during the day to get rid of excess oil in my t-zone and chin, but after using the mattifying gel every morning after my mosturizer and before my foundation I no longer have to worry about using them. This product keeps my face oil free all day long. I would highly recommend. Also a little bit goes along way, so it lasts.</li>
    <li> I had written this review before, but the distributer had it removed.  The product was old and in international packaging.  The distributer contacted me to reassure me that it wasn&#x27;t, but I contacted the manufacturer and discussed it with them.  With the stamp on the crimp of the tube, they were able to tell me &#x27;yes, it is international packaging&#x27; and the &#x27;product was packaged in 2008&#x27;.  The product is nearly 5 years old.  I was told however, that the product does not expire and should not cause any problems on my face.  I have just started to use it and it seems to be a bit different than the newer product.  It has a different feel on my face and I am not comfortable with it.  I am going to toss it and buy from someone else.  I love the product (in general) otherwise and will get a new tube.</li>
    <li> OC Eight works pretty good, it doesn&#x27;t last 8 hours, but when you put it on initially it&#x27;ll make your skin smooth and shine free. Probably last a good 2-3 hours. If you put on too much, it&#x27;ll dry your skin, otherwise it works pretty good as long as you&#x27;re not expecting it to be some miracle that last the whole day.</li>
    <li> Sonia Kashuk&#x27;s mattifier from Target (which costs a fraction of what OC Eight costs) is much more effective and has a much superior texture. Target had run out, so I ordered OC and thought it would be even better - but it is not!</li>
    <li> Feels good on the skin. However, it does not mattify for very long!</li>
    <li> I purchased this a couple of months ago at the advice of my aesthetician. I was told it would make me matte and keep me shine-free the whole day. I live in Georgia, so it gets extremely humid and hot over the summer. I definitely noticed a difference when I used it vs. when I did not. However, I expected it to make me more matte. I am hoping it will meet my expectations over the winter/spring! :-)</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do what it said it would do--didn&#x27;t control shine or decrease pore size.  Definitely a disappointment, not worth it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, and I think it is great. It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but is the most effective I have tried.</li>
    <li> Had I received the correct product, I would have been given this 5 stars because OC8 Mattifying Gel is a great product. I just wish I had recieved it instead of the Adult Acne Treatment Gel. Unstatisfied.</li>
    <li> How...how does this product have any stars?????&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in one of my glossyboxes and I am APPALLED they even considered associated this product with their company. \\&quot;Worn by American Idol hasbeen someone or other...\\&quot; MY A$$&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this product suck and not tame shine...it literally LITERALLY smells like paint thinner... or whatever chemical you use to remove paint, I&#x27;m going to add in the smell of gasoline as well....Now tell me WHY would I ever put this near my face???&lt;br /&gt;and please for around $30??? Save your money and your face!!!!</li>
    <li> This actually does help with my shine. After several hours I am only again. You can reapply, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
    <li> First off, I was skeptical.. I had some doubts.. I have really oily skin (not severely oily skin), but I kept asking myself.. is it going to be enough to control my oily T-zone for me? I was unsure if this product was really going to work to keep my shine down.. And the price was somewhat killing me.. Then I thought what did I have to lose? I had to give this mattifying oil control product a shot, so I did.. And oh my goodness, it works for me.. Thank the good heavens above. The annoying oil shininess on my T-zone is CONTROLLED, and I don&#x27;t have that glossy slick anymore.. I kept checking every hour and the shine is definitely controlled, and not very visible; only very very little shine for me after several few hours 5+ had passed, but that is very acceptable to me and it has improved my looks by A LOT. I took a picture of myself after 8 hours, and the oily shine was only very little visible that it is not much noticeable. So far, so good. I definitely look much more BETTER without all that shine! I&#x27;m getting more people looking at me longer and more heads turning lol. All I can say is.. Yes!! No more blotting papers, no more going to the restroom to wipe off the oil on my face, no more worrying about taking pics with your face full of grease, no more feeling down, no more avoiding bright lights from above, all of that is NO MORE.. I&#x27;m just soo happy I found this product. Giving this product 5 stars. Works well for a guy like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a average oily T-zone, then give OC eight professional mattifying gel a try, you&#x27;ll not regret it, I&#x27;m sure. I highly recommend it. I don&#x27;t recommend it to people with serious extremely oily skin though! You might be disappointed as the people who gave 1 star reviews on this product; but hey, give it a go maybe it&#x27;ll work? If not, oh well! It was worth a try, right? Just contact customer service, and let them help you out if you aren&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for oily face issue. I used it a few times it does work helping keep my face not so oily, to much will certainly leave a white powder on your face when it dries. I am a guy so only used this product once. No longer use it since oily issue has resided.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!  It really mattifies your skin.  Just beware; don&#x27;t rub/scratch your skin too much else the product will flake off.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! It does work very well, but does not last quite the full 8 hours. I feel this is due to the oilyness of my skin and not due to the product! My dermatologist recommended I try this, and I recommend others try it as well!</li>
    <li> This is very effective at controlling oily skin for about  three hours and then one&#x27;s skin makes up for it by being doubly oily!</li>
    <li> Like many other negative reviews here, I too have extremely oily skin, and OC Eight simply does not work for me. I was so excited to have gotten what I thought would be the end of my terribly embarrassing problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I already knew that OC Eight wasn&#x27;t going to work, while I was still in the process of applying it. It felt very uncomfortable on my skin -- it was similar to how my face feels at the end of the day, when it&#x27;s totally covered in oil -- even though there was no oil on my face yet. It also smelled oddly -- a chemical scent. It&#x27;s not *that* bad, it just bugged me. But once I finished, I saw that it had actually made my skin *shinier*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that I possibly needed to wait a few minutes for it. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t. It didn&#x27;t feel better, it didn&#x27;t become matte, and it didn&#x27;t prevent or slow any future visible oil production either. Another annoyance was that you have to be careful not to apply too much, because it can dry into a white powdery streak on your face. But by far the worst aspect of it is that you can&#x27;t touch your face after you apply it; if you do, it will begin to smudge &amp; peel up into white debris. Well, I tried using the product in various ways for a week; applying less or more, rubbing it in less or more, re-applying later in the day, etc. Nothing worked. Sadly, I had to give up on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wound up giving the tubes away to two female friends of mine, and interestingly, they both tried it out &amp; said it worked wonders for them (just like most of the reviewers here have said). And, yes, both of them have significantly different skin than I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, OC Eight just simply does not work for certain people. The other negative reviewers and I didn&#x27;t get bad batches, nor are we \\&quot;doing it wrong\\&quot; -- OC Eight just doesn&#x27;t work for all types of skin.</li>
    <li> I love love love it . This is the first product to keep my face oil free for hours . Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> This is what I exactly had in mind for my skin. I have Oily skin and I have used many products that did the job, but an hour later shine is back and even a break out or two. When I read the reviews for the OC Eight Professional Mattifying Gel, I decided to check it out. I was drawn to it by the price as well. I got the product and I am sooo happy at the results; long lasting up to 8 hours! I will continue to buy this gel for as long as I have oily skin!</li>
    <li> Same product that I receive at my Dermatologist for almost half the price. It helps to minimize the oil and shine on my face. It doesn&#x27;t last for 8 hours with me but I still use it everyday and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> This product did not do as I expected based on the description of the product.  It did not help with my oily complexion.  In fact, I think it made it worse!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product, as it was recommended by my dermatologist. The first day I used it, I thought it was the best thing ever. It kept me completely oil free on the first one or two applications. After that, my skin became tolerant and I&#x27;m back to just dealing with it every day. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything: over the counter mattifiers, oil-free makeup, every prescription under the sun, including accutane (twice may I add!!) for my combo acne/oiliness. I&#x27;ve also tried the OCM (Oil Cleansing Method) which didn&#x27;t work for me either. I guess I&#x27;ll keep using the oil blotting sheets and reapplying powder every hour until such a miracle product comes out on the market. If your skin isn&#x27;t extremely oily, this may work for you. Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I did not think I would find something to control my extremely oily forehead until my dermatologist recommended this product. He gave me a sample and was hooked right away. It only last for about 8 hours abut any thing else I tried lasted significantly less if at all. I did not expirence any break outs or irritation and I have slightly sensitive skin. I would recommend this to anyone who battles the oil on their faces!</li>
    <li> Works good. Doesn&#x27;t work all day. Have to re-apply after a few hours. But works better than most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> this product really does what it says.  put it on kinda thick, let it dry, and apply makeup over top.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and gave me some samples to try. I apply it right before my makeup and it helps control the oil all day. When I got ready to purchase my first tube, I could not find it locally so I went to Amazon because they have everything!</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars, it works great!! I have extremely oily skin, and before I purchased the products I read most of the reviews, and per the reviews I applied a generous amount and stayed matte all day!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Product being sold on Amazon is product that is old. So it causes breakouts. If you have sensitive skin this may not be for you</li>
    <li> Makes me look sooooo hot for when I go out. This thing is great, and just one of them lasts for months. However, you gotta try to find a balance in the amount you put on. I noticed that when I put a little bit more than usual, it&#x27;ll dry up and leave some noticeable white markings on my face. Then I put a bit less, and the oil overcomes the gel. But most of the time it does it&#x27;s job surprisingly well.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product.  Controlled facial oil for barely two hours, let alone eight.  Reapplying as instructions allow did not help.  Will not purchase again or recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I choose this product because it had great reviews. When the product arrived and I tried it, it worked just as promised. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or leave any residue in your face. I would apply it after I put on the moisturizer. I would highly recommend this product for people who have oily faces.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My dermatologist recommended this for my oily forehead (I had to use those oil blotters every few hours before I started using this) and it has really made a huge difference. I am careful not to put it all over my face, just in the center of my forehead, because otherwise it has a white powdery residue on areas of my skin that are not oily. The tube is small but it lasts me about 4 months so it is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love this gel.  I have tried many-many other brands (cheaper and more expensive) and always came back to this one for one reason - it makes my face look mat. I mean it makes my skin less oily (although there are few other lotions that do the same) but it also has a huge benefit - my face looks mat after I apply it so I don&#x27;t need to cover it with powder to get rid of the shine (I had this problem with lots of mattifyers). I does control shine but it also looks mat on your face.  And I would even add that it visually whitens my face - another words, it might be a good primer for some people. If your face color is good in general and your only problem is oily skin, this product may make you look fabulous. Maybe little bit of loose powder and that it&#x27;s. But it doesn&#x27;t fill my pores or fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is not cheap but ... I couldn&#x27;t find anything more affordable and as good as this gel. It gives me about 6 hours of no shine which is more than anything else.  No rush (but Ia m not an allergic), make-up applies easy if you let it dry for few min and it doesn&#x27;t cake afterwards. Although there have no improvements with my acne like some other people told.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with this product but I wish it was more affordable. One tube lasts for about a month (using it twice a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I gave this product only 4 stars because recently when I purchased it online (as I have been doing it for about a year) for some strange reason I received another product (mattifying gel, white-purple tube, the same brand). First time I though it was just a mistake but then it happened again, and again, and again. I tried to contact the seller directly by email or phone and ask why, but always ended up talking to the Amazon Customer Service (which btw has been amazing).  Both times they issued full refunds and let me keep the wrong product which was kind of nice. Not sure if there is a difference between the original (what you see on Amazon) and the one that I get but if i buy something - I expect to receive what I pay for. So I am a bit frustrated...Amazon) and the one that I get but if i buy something - I expect to receive what I pay for. So I am a bit frustrated...</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that I try OC8 for my oily forehead, and she recommended that I buy it on Amazon.com.  I have been thrilled with the results!  It helps keep my forehead dry or &amp;#34;mattified&amp;#34; for up to 8 hours as promised.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any break-outs with it either.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I heard many great things about this product. My dermatologist recommended I purchase this product to help reduce my oily skin. It has helped, but unfortunately not to the extent I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to help with the T-zone shine.  This works for me and does not clog my pores and cause breakouts.  My face stays shine free most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I use to have to get it through my Dermatologist.  Nice to be able to order on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why they call it a gel, it&#x27;s a cream</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product as it is unsatisfactory at absorbing facial oil.  They obviously reformulated this product and this new formulation absorbs facial oil for MAYBE an hour or so--nowhere near the 8 hours claimed on the product. (By the way, I do NOT have very oily skin.) The original formula from years ago was fantastic and they should have left well enough alone.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me at all. It claims to leave you shine-free for 8 eight hours and that is not the case. After two hours, there was shine all over my t-zone. It also left  a funny smell. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had used OC8 from my dermatologist in the past and it worked wonderfully with and without makeup. I loved it so much I had to purchase it again. Unfortunately this product did not hold up. I first thought it might have something to do with the increased humidity in my area due to recent thundershowers so I waited a few weeks to see if it would work better in a drier climate. My face was shiny less than an hour after I applied the product. I even experimented with different lotion and foundation but this product just simply doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, it DOESN&#x27;T WORK</li>
    <li> I wanted it to work. I have a moderate problem with the T-zone. Without a mattifyer at night (I use generally use a mattifying makeup primer daytime and a hydrating lotion nightime) I need a good soap-and-water wash up 2x/day. Until now I have used lotions - this was my first curious attempt at a gel. I persevered for 3-1/2 weeks with this using it only at night and using my regular mattifying makeup primer during daytime but by the time I called it quits my whole face had become a terrible problem. I woke up in the morning to an oil slick and my primer could no longer keep up during the day. I have returned to my previous mattifying lotion (Shiseido) and once again am happily washing up just at before bedtime and a quick rinse in the shower in the morning. The only good thing I can say about this is that it did not go on goopy with a thick layer of gluey mess like some of the lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Not much different than any other mattifier I have tried.  A lot of shine within a couple of hours.  Better than nothing, but not better than the others...</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin.  This seems to help, but it only lasts about an hour.  It does make your skin feel very silky before putting on your foundation, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I have tried all of the oil control and mattifying gels and this is the only one that ever worked for more than a few hours.  It is invisible when on, so I can wear it without makeup!</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and have tried everything on the market to get a good result but nothing has helped; this was no exception. An hour after applying it heavily and waiting for it to dry, I was an oil slick again. I&#x27;ll go back to using my $12 stuff from CVS for the same results for less money.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and good price.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this product works or not. I personally like the Murad oil mattifying moisturizer. It&#x27;s the only product that did anything for me in terms of oil control.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this because I get very shiny with normal lotions.  By the end of the day I&#x27;m usually shiny again, but in general, it works well for me.</li>
    <li> As described.. thanks.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this product and it works great! I have to make sure I put it on about an hour before I leave because sometimes it leaves white marks.</li>
    <li> It is the most important product I use to keep my oily skin under control.  I love it when products actually work.  Bravo!</li>
    <li> I have a very oily nose which extends to the areas surrounding my nose as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended using OC Eight for mattifying purposes. I used this every day for about a year. It definitely works when you glob on at least a pea size. It also lasted me about 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this product is definitely comedogenic. My nose pores started to fill with the gunk from this gel so I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this gel also does nothing to solve the root of the problem. After doing some online research, I ended up using witch hazel to get rid of the excess oil on my face. Witch hazel also slowly regulates your skin&#x27;s oil production.</li>
    <li> i cant believe that i have finally found a primer that works great for my oily skin . i have tried so many expensive product like&lt;br /&gt;smash box, Murad, Sephora anti-shine primer, peter Thomas Roth gel just to mention a few. this mattifying gel works. i recommend it to everyone. tip on using this product is to apply a thick layer on your T-zone and a thin layer on the other areas of your face and then let it dry for a about 25- 30 minutes. trust me it works great when you let it dry.  it is a huge tube so you are getting a lot for your money. if you are thinking of buying it PLEASE TRY IT, BECAUSE IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> I get very oily on my chin and I thought this was worth trying. It doesn&#x27;t last a full 8 hour day, but certainly helps. I have been using it religiously since my first purchase.</li>
    <li> It just works that&#x27;s all I can say.... tried 10 or more different products in the past... I recently received this is my GlossyBox (a full size at that):) so I&#x27;m really happy &#x27;bout that! I used as directed basically I used a very liberal amount let stand at least 10 - 15 minutes before applying makeup... and I stayed pretty flawless all day long.... I&#x27;m very please with the results....I move around a lot at work and usually get shiny but this kept the shine away! I love this stuff! I&#x27;m happy I was introduced to this.... and will continue to buy this product!  my search for the perfect mattifying product is over!</li>
    <li> It helped reduce the blemishes on my face!  My skin looks clearer and smooth.  This is the first product with results I have been happiest!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have a very oily forehead and wear bangs so my dermatologist recommended this and it&#x27;s great. I don&#x27;t need to shampoo my bangs daily and wash my hair every other day due to the oil on just my forehead.</li>
    <li> Product does not work. I have very oily skin so I thought I found the answer to my  skin problem when I read the reviews, It was the opposite.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Not sure that this soaks up oil very well but it does keep your make-up on for a long-time, but it&#x27;s not hard to wash off.</li>
    <li> This truly reduces or eliminates the shine from my face, I&#x27;m very pleased. For me, it does not last 8 hours as advertised, but about 4. Still, all I have to do is reapply it. It has a medicinal smell, but that dissipates soon after you apply it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why more people don&#x27;t know about this product. My skin has always been extremely oily, but nothing I used could control it. I put this on in the morning, and at night my skin still isn&#x27;t shiny! I will say though, you need more than just a thin layer. I put on about a quarter sized amount or more, to my nose and forhead. Experiment with the right amount, to get an all day matte!</li>
    <li> The product does a wonderful job of keeping my face oil free.  No more shine!  I would recommend it and will reorder it when my tube runs out.</li>
