      <li>Overall it was a good buy, and I&#x27;m glad I spent my money on it.</li>
      <li>It was more curly and layered, nothing like the long, wavy length in the photo.</li>
      <li>Easy fix though, not too big of a deal.</li>
      <li>They are pretty decent wigs for 6.99 though.</li>

      <li>It took only 2 and a half weeks to arrive, which I was very pleased by that.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very long and soft, but tangles and sheds easily.</li>
      <li>The hair is so soft feels like real hair</li>
      <li>They do shed and they are NOT thick</li>
      <li>Everything is as pictured, though the dark brown color is a bit redder in the light.</li>
      <li>of the two wigs I bought was only wavy on the top half.. and the other was super poofy and wavy.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend and I have no regrets.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this wig for everyday use , its really long and gets tangled very easily and since it sheds alot</li>
      <li>Bangs are pretty long but nothing scissors or bobby pins can&#x27;t fix.</li>
      <li>So natural looking.</li>
      <li>:) it&#x27;s quite thick and doesn&#x27;t shed as much when brushed.</li>
      <li>Really soft and long!</li>
      <li>Its not altogether bad and there are some areas where it can improve just as well as some areas that are good.</li>

    <li> Sheds everywhete , don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> So natural looking. I wish my real hair looked this good! For this price I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Bought the dark brown one. Looks just like the photo. Fits nicely. Doesn&#x27;t look synthetic. Totally worth it, so buy it!</li>
    <li> The shipment came before the expected date, but still took a few weeks because it was shipping via airmail from China. The wig comes with 2 net caps. Everything is as pictured, though the dark brown color is a bit redder in the light. It&#x27;s very long and soft, but tangles and sheds easily. However, other reviewers before me had said this so I was expecting it. Just make sure you have a wire tooth brush or comb to brush it with. It&#x27;s also a bit thin, but with the right styling it&#x27;s hard to notice.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a wonderful wig for the price.</li>
    <li> Hate this wig it tangles really bad. I will never ever buy it again!</li>
    <li> The wig I received looks nothing like the picture. It was more curly and layered, nothing like the long, wavy length in the photo. Otherwise I really like this wig. :) it&#x27;s quite thick and doesn&#x27;t shed as much when brushed. Will recommend.</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;The wigs was great the color are truth I am so glade and coming on the times very nice I like it&lt;br /&gt;Thkx</li>
    <li> The bang was too long and i had to cut it. The hair was maageable and did get a bit matted but not like some wigs i have had b4. The hair has minimal shedding and i tgink its a good buy. Its not altogether bad and there are some areas where it can improve just as well as some areas that are good.</li>
    <li> I am amazed by the fact it&#x27;s still a nice quality and I&#x27;ve had it for a while now. It took only 2 and a half weeks to arrive, which I was very pleased by that. Overall it was a good buy, and I&#x27;m glad I spent my money on it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like the pick.</li>
    <li> This wig wasn&#x27;t what I expected , it only took 3 weeks to arrive and it didn&#x27;t come in a box like the picture showed it was just thrown into a bag. When I tried it on it wasn&#x27;t full like i thought it would be , and it sheds a lot so i only used it once . I don&#x27;t recommend this wig for everyday use , its really long and gets tangled very easily and since it sheds alot im kinda scared to comb it .</li>
    <li> Looks and feels just like real hair.  Just trim the bangs and it&#x27;s beautiful!  Would highly recommend and I have no regrets.  Will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have to say I am impressed. I received the wig yesterday, sooner than expected and I absolutely love it. The hair is so soft feels like real hair and I am getting lots of compliments. I will be ordering another one real soon.</li>
    <li> The wig looks NOTHING like the picture showed it&#x27;s completely different , I&#x27;m honestly really disappointed with my purchase :(</li>
    <li> to tight and I got a somewhat refund. It was nothing compared to what I paid for this wig. That was poorly made. It looks nothing like the picture when it came to me. My 3 year-old daughter is getting more use it of it o dress up.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth wig I have bought off amazon and it is absolutely amazing. The color is gorgeous (I bought the dark brown) and it is so incredibly soft. The waves on the wig are beautiful but near the end the waves stop and the ends are just straight. Easy fix though, not too big of a deal. I will definitely be order another one in a different color sometime soon. :)</li>
    <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t buy these.. I guess I don&#x27;t look as good with bangs as I thought haha. They are pretty decent wigs for 6.99 though. They do shed and they are NOT thick but I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything spectacular. They tangle VERY easily so just treat them nicely.&lt;br /&gt;One of the two wigs I bought was only wavy on the top half.. and the other was super poofy and wavy. I ended up straightening both on low heat and cutting the bangs shorter and straighter.</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig! Looks like fishing line on Amazon but the material is way better in person. Really soft and long! I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and the hair is past mid back. Bangs are pretty long but nothing scissors or bobby pins can&#x27;t fix. Also I received it 2 weeks before the set delivery day! I strongly recommend Map Of Beauty! Not Cool2DayINC or whatever. I ordered one wig from them in June and I still have not received it.</li>
