<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have severe allergies.  This has been a great product for me.  I don&#x27;t itch when I use it.  It was recommended by my allergist.  I would recommend it to anyone who has severe allergies or contact dermatitis.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Product arrived as expected!  The packaging was fantastic.  The seller took care to ensure that the product would not be damaged.  I would absolutely purchase from this seller again.  Vanicream soap is wonderfully gentle.  If you have skin issues or just want a product that provides both a gentle but effective clean, this is the product for you.  I use this both for my face and body.  I will never use anything else again!</li>
    <li> I like the soap but it is a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> This is well know by me. But it came all smashed  the Thank you anyway</li>
    <li> I cannot use conventional soap so this was a lifesaver! Feel fresh, clean, and moisturized after using it.  Keeps my skin in healthy condition.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My daughter uses on her face and it has cleared her face up in just a few days of use.</li>
    <li> Love it, only soap I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause and heals breakouts!</li>

    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. MY HUSBAND HAD TERRIBLE ALLERGIES FOR YEARS EVEN THOUGH WE USED HYPOALLERGENIC PRODUCTS. AFTER THE RECOMMENDTION FROM THE ALLERGIST, WE BOUGHT ALL THE VANICREAM PRODUCTS AND HE&#x27;S NEVER BEEN BETTER!</li>
    <li> Lathers well, cleans well and no fragrance.  Very pleased. Not much more I can say about a bar of soap but Amazon requires that I keep typing! :-)</li>
    <li> Using this bar has slowed the Winter itch problems.  I have been using the popular lotion bar (fragrance free) and still had to use scads of lotion to keep itch at bay.  However, after using one bar of this product the itch is much better.  As a general statement, this bar seems to last longer than my previous shower bar.</li>
    <li> I love Vanicream Cleansing Bars because I have very thin, sensitive skin prone to eczema flare-ups that dislikes every other kind of cleansing bar I have tried.</li>
    <li> This soap is good if you have skin problems.</li>
    <li> dermatologist recommended to us</li>
    <li> I have eczema and my dermatologist said this is the only soap I should use in the shower/bath. My skin isn&#x27;t breaking out anymore from all those other ingredients in the soaps I was using. I never run out of Vanicream Cleansing Bars now!&lt;br /&gt;For just washing my hands, I use CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser for Normal to Dry Skin. It leaves your hands feeling soft. And for body moisturizer, I use CeraVe Moisturizing Cream for Normal to Dry Skin. This routine really works for me. My skin is super dry, and this hydrates it and keeps it moist. They also have facial creams.</li>
    <li> works well.  Does the job.  Dr happy</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have very dry skin and eczema. I love to use it to wash my face and my daughter loves to use it during her bath.  It does not leave any film any where.  It feels so nice and clean.  It&#x27;s awesome!  I&#x27;m always looking for products that help our skin without any irritation and I believe I found it.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it did have a slight scent that I&#x27;m not too fond of but it does go away.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing bar.  It doesnt dry my face out and has helped my face from breaking out.  I like the no dyes etc in it as well.  It also gets makeup off better than most  bars or washes.</li>
    <li> Gave me the same face rash all soaps do, not even reduced.</li>
    <li> Vanicream soap is the best I have ever found reguardless if you have sensitive skin or tough skin. You will feel the difference after just one use. I will use nothing else now I have found this product.</li>
