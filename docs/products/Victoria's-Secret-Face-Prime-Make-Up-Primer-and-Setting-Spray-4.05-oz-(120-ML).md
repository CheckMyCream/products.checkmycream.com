      <li>but I haven&#x27;t broke out or experienced any adverse reactions using this product :)</li>
      <li>Nice product  </li>

      <li>Usually love anything from Victoria&#x27;s Secret....perfume makeup lingerie...</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried this as a primer yet, but as a setting spray it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>once swatched some eyeshadow shades on my hand then sprayed them with this product and even after rubbing on them they didn&#x27;t smudge (but easily washed off with soap and water).</li>
      <li>and I easily break out/have allergic reactions when my skin doesn&#x27;t like something -</li>
      <li>Your make up will survive all kinds of weather and even stay strong on those with oily skin.</li>
      <li>Looks fresh hours after applying make up!</li>
      <li>I do spray my face a multiple times throughout the process of getting ready (after foundation/concealer, after blush/bronzer, after eyeshadow, etc lol)</li>
      <li>so perhaps that has lead to my success...</li>
      <li>If you feel like you&#x27;re breaking your bank with the price fear not because it&#x27;s well worth it and the holy grail of all setting sprays out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I spray my face after applying makeup, and it does help my makeup last a couple of hours longer than it would on its own.  </li>
      <li>VS Make it Last Prime and Setting Spray is the BEST setting spray I have ever used hands down.</li>
      <li>Ive tried a lot of other setting sprays and by far this is the best i have found so far</li>
      <li>Shipped super fast</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>Better to use something that&#x27;s actually beneficial for the skin.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re the one who has those days where you feel good, look on point, and don&#x27;t want your makeup to go to waste, this will be your BFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So sad VS discontinued their make up line, but happy there are people on here making it available.</li>
      <li>I can use this final product and the makeup will stay on easily for 12+ hours.  </li>
      <li>Felt like I sprayed Aqua Net (strong hairspray from the 90s) on my face.</li>
      <li>This product is pure gold, I deff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with Victoria&#x27;s Secret PRIMEüëçüèºüòÉ</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you let it dry completely before and after applying makeup</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s all natural and gives your skin that glow and luminous texture.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>i would not waste my money again</li>
      <li>Really keeps make up in place for long work days no need for retouches.</li>
      <li>I use Revlon primer before applying foundation, but this Victoria&#x27;s Secret primer is spectacular in providing the final stabilizing layer.  </li>
      <li>I have used this when I used to go out to work, social events, and etc.</li>
      <li>I do not live in a humid area (where that may affect the spray) and I am unsure how this product would do with sensitive skin which I do not have.</li>

<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> Just shocked.</li>
<li> Too bad VS discontinued it :(</li>
<li> Smell was horrible as well.</li>
<li> Horrible!!!.</li>
<li> As a setter after make up is also is terrible</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast shipping. I like this product for the ending of makeup.</li>
    <li> surprisingly effective spray at a great price.  I spray my face after applying makeup, and it does help my makeup last a couple of hours longer than it would on its own.  I have oily to combination skin, and the spray helps to keep my skin semi-matte for about 4-6 hours.  however, since I&#x27;m looking for products that will help my makeup stay put and matte for 8-10 hours, my hunt continues.</li>
    <li> The one I got must&#x27;ve been fake. It feels like water, doesn&#x27;t smell at all or anything like how everyone else says. Isn&#x27;t sticky or anything. I got mine from eBay. I would&#x27;nt buy from there again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried this as a primer yet, but as a setting spray it&#x27;s pretty good. Too bad VS discontinued it :(</li>
    <li> Great product! Shipped super fast</li>
    <li> This Product is exelent</li>
    <li> it dint work for me... I just don&#x27;t like the feeling of it on my face but my face is just too oily</li>
    <li> Excellent product at an affordable price</li>
    <li> I love it!! Lightweight and does not break my out like other primers. I will be purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> Save your money! Felt like I sprayed Aqua Net (strong hairspray from the 90s) on my face. Smell was horrible as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Does exactly what it says. Just make sure you let it dry completely before and after applying makeup and it&#x27;ll work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see a noticeable difference when I use it but it feels good on the skin. Scent bothers me a little sometimes.</li>
    <li> Usually love anything from Victoria&#x27;s Secret....perfume makeup lingerie...this does not feel like it makes a difference. I buy pretty high quality expensive makeup like Bobbi brown and Chanel but by the end of my work day my makeups all smeared or sweated off. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I did not like this spray from victoria it feels like i am puttung water on my face i would not waste my money again</li>
    <li> Nice product  i love it..</li>
    <li> Great hold..... Excellent finish.... Best EVER primer!!!</li>
    <li> I found that this product works well, keeps my makeup in place as it should. I do spray my face a multiple times throughout the process of getting ready (after foundation/concealer, after blush/bronzer, after eyeshadow, etc lol) so perhaps that has lead to my success... I have sensitive skin and I easily break out/have allergic reactions when my skin doesn&#x27;t like something - but I haven&#x27;t broke out or experienced any adverse reactions using this product :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once swatched some eyeshadow shades on my hand then sprayed them with this product and even after rubbing on them they didn&#x27;t smudge (but easily washed off with soap and water).</li>
    <li> Ive tried a lot of other setting sprays and by far this is the best i have found so far, i put on make up and it stays on the whole day, there&#x27;s been days where i have fallen asleep with makeup on and when i wake up everything is still in place and looks perfect.</li>
    <li> VS Make it Last Prime and Setting Spray is the BEST setting spray I have ever used hands down. Being a former MAC setting spray user, I was stunned by how well my makeup lasted all day, did not melt off, did not fade, just stayed put as if I just applied it! Just shocked. I bought it thinking not much of it but now I haven&#x27;t bought any other since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use it as a primer because I feel like my pores look the same and it makes no difference with the smoothness or application of my foundation. But avoiding face melt down; YES! If you&#x27;re the one who has those days where you feel good, look on point, and don&#x27;t want your makeup to go to waste, this will be your BFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels lightweight like nothing is on, fresh/non-scented, and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like elf or other setting spray. If you feel like you&#x27;re breaking your bank with the price fear not because it&#x27;s well worth it and the holy grail of all setting sprays out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I have oily skin and wear full coverage makeup and this product works great for me. I do not live in a humid area (where that may affect the spray) and I am unsure how this product would do with sensitive skin which I do not have.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful. I bought it in store around Christmas still have some gunna by another one now!! Really keeps make up in place for long work days no need for retouches.</li>
    <li> Great stuff your make-up does stay on for about eight hours.  Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
    <li> This setting spray is my holy grail make up staple. So sad VS discontinued their make up line, but happy there are people on here making it available. Your make up will survive all kinds of weather and even stay strong on those with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I got mine from victorias secret store and i use it to damp my beauty sponge before i apply foundation.works great!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this spray. I don&#x27;t think it works well as a primer. After using it as a primer, my face got very oily, but as a setting spray it was mediocre. I didn&#x27;t love it or hate it. It does an ok job, but I probably will not order it again.</li>
    <li> This product is my life. I usually spray before putting make up on my face, and apply after make up is applied. My make up stays on all day, and sometimes even the next morning. I have used this when I used to go out to work, social events, and etc. This product is pure gold, I deff. recommend it to anyone who hates buying expensive primers and just wants one thing that does both.</li>
    <li> Mehhh.. doesn&#x27;t even tell you the ingredients. I have opted for this great makeup setting spray instead:   http://goo.gl/NuO81f    ...it&#x27;s all natural and gives your skin that glow and luminous texture. Better to use something that&#x27;s actually beneficial for the skin.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it! This is the best product I have ever used to set my makeup. I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate it at all. Keeps my makeup set all day. If I forget to use this I can tell by the time I get to work. Also does not make skin oily. I hope they never stop making this.</li>
    <li> wife likes the product. (second bottle)</li>
    <li> When I want makeup to truly last all day long and especially in the heat, I&#x27;ve found that a primer is 100% critical.  I use Revlon primer before applying foundation, but this Victoria&#x27;s Secret primer is spectacular in providing the final stabilizing layer.  I can use this final product and the makeup will stay on easily for 12+ hours.  I haven&#x27;t found it necessary to use a really expensive foundation for this product to work well.</li>
    <li> Make up stays put. Last all day. Just spray and it sets the look.</li>
    <li> As a primer is a feels like you spray diluted  glue on your face...or hair spray...Horrible!!!. As a setter after make up is also is terrible</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with Victoria&#x27;s Secret PRIMEüëçüèºüòÉ</li>
    <li> not really recommend&lt;br /&gt;thankx</li>
    <li> my favourite primer and setting spray. helps keep my make up stay all day long without smudging!! Looks fresh hours after applying make up!</li>
