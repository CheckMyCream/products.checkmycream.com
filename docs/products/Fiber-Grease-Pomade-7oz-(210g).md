      <li>I&#x27;m glad a friend told me about this.  </li>

      <li>Glad that Amazon carries it.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Use a comb for more formal occasions.</li>
      <li>I love using this product</li>
      <li>Fiber Grease and the other products in the Cool Grease line from Fine Cosmetics LTD of Japan are excellent water based pomades with superior styling and hold.</li>
      <li>Cool!</li>
      <li>It is easy to work with and it washes out easy with water in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and you can easily touch it up as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Washes out easily with shampoo and water.</li>
      <li>Since it is water soluble it washes out easily without even shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I gave this stuff five stars because it washes out really easily and helps me do what I want with my hair.</li>
      <li>Holds spiked hair but water soluble so washes out easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong too for spiking the hair.</li>
      <li>Suavecito holds well, but the smell is too strong for me.  </li>
      <li>This pomade has a moderately strong hold.  </li>
      <li>This pomade is not that strong</li>
      <li>This Fiber Grease Pomade is perfect to mold, sculpt, slick, sleek, spike, piece or pomp most Hair Types.  </li>
      <li>Works just fine for me with a medium hold.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It leaves a slight sheen, not too shiny, not too matte; in my opinion the perfect balance.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are listed in Japanese, so I can&#x27;t report to the \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; or animal-friendliness of this product, but I can tell you it works great.</li>
      <li>The water-based pomades are surprisingly fantastic.</li>
      <li>I have to keep my son from stealing it from me because we both love it so much!</li>
      <li>Maybe Cool Grease XX will do it?  </li>
      <li>but such a good value.</li>
      <li>Its not too sticky in the conventional sense, has a pleasant sweet, Juicy Fruit-esque aroma, and washes out easily as it is water based.</li>
      <li>The smell is subtle and great !  </li>
      <li>Though I do like the smell of Layrite, I think the Fiber Grease&#x27;s mild scent is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great pomade if you have straight asian hair like me.</li>
      <li>Came quickly with out any problems.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own, slicking it back with a couple dabs of Fiber Grease keeps it</li>
      <li>but this is worth it</li>
      <li>It smells like fresh Macintosh apples.</li>
      <li>Well worth the wait</li>
      <li>I was iffy on the price at first, but luckily I got it as part of a Christmas gift.</li>
      <li>first started with Layrite.</li>
      <li>I first bought it from the barber.</li>
      <li>I will definitely order again &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Have used this product before and like that it is not &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; when used on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;Holds all day and has a nice shine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried American Crew, Suavecito and Layrite, and Fiber Grease is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Authentic japanese stuff.</li>
      <li>Fiber Grease meets all the criteria: holds strong, doesn&#x27;t get hard, very easy to restyle, doesn&#x27;t smell when applied and washed off.  </li>
      <li>Instantly and get cool with Fiber Grease and Cool Grease</li>
      <li>However it is not a &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; pomade really, it stays pliable, but is much more pliable in low amounts.</li>
      <li>this stuff is far superior to other knock offs.</li>
      <li>The only product that easily spikes my hair up.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a strong lasting smell in my hair after I wash with shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely a good deal, since the jar I originally bought from the barber was half the size and nearly the same price.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal.</li>
      <li>it has a bizarre texture , overall ...</li>
      <li>Looking at how much comes in the container</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
      <li>No gel, wax, or pomade had worked for me before (keeping hair straight and the way I style it in the morning).</li>
      <li>jar is a good size, even with my thick hair and frequent use I&#x27;ll probably get ~6 months out of it, well worth the price.</li>
      <li>The hold is nice but not too stiff.</li>
      <li>and the cost is fine since it lasts a long time...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good pomade, gives a relaxed look in low amounts, but is very thick and must be used with wet hair, and in large amounts can dry somewhat, acting kind of like a gel look. However it is not a &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; pomade really, it stays pliable, but is much more pliable in low amounts. Rather high hold and moderate to slightly high shine</li>
    <li> I gave this stuff five stars because it washes out really easily and helps me do what I want with my hair. It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad, though it does smell a bit cute.</li>
    <li> Perfect grease. One of the best ones out there no doubt.  Add I have used over 8 different pomadea and this is without a doubt the best one. Start with a little amount trust me trust me just go adding more as desired.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried American Crew, Suavecito and Layrite, and Fiber Grease is my favorite.  American Crew hold is very weak.  My hair keeps falling off.  Suavecito holds well, but the smell is too strong for me.  Even after washing with shampoo, the smell still sticks on my hair.  Also, the pomade tends to get hard.  Layrite is similar to Suavecito in term of hold, but I don&#x27;t like the smell either.  There&#x27;s a strong lasting smell in my hair after I wash with shampoo.  Fiber Grease meets all the criteria: holds strong, doesn&#x27;t get hard, very easy to restyle, doesn&#x27;t smell when applied and washed off.  I&#x27;m buying my 3rd jar today.</li>
    <li> I have short asian hair.  Thick, coarse texture and lots of it.  This holds the hairstyle I choose and doesn&#x27;t get crunchy or leave hard to wash residue.  Granted, I still wash it out at the end of the day but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp or flake.  Good stuff.  The 7 oz. version is industrial sized.  It will last you awhile even if you use it daily.  I&#x27;m glad a friend told me about this.  Glad that Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing hair product. I have been using it for several years. It is water soluable so it washes out every time you wash your hair so there is NO YUCKY build up!!! I have short hair in a very fun, messy style....I put a little Fiber Grease in after I blow dry my hair and use my fingers to style....hair stays in place and my groovy hair is good until bedtime. I get stopped on the street. This product is very difficult to find...happy Amazon has it....I have actually ordered it from Japan(its origin)....buy it, you will not be disappointed....probably not great for longer hair.</li>
    <li> Really good for slick back hair</li>
    <li> Fiber Grease is the best promade around!  I have to keep my son from stealing it from me because we both love it so much!</li>
    <li> By far the best pomade I have ever used. Well worth the wait this stuff is far superior to other knock offs. I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff, in fact it might be radioactive and slowly killing me BUT life is short and dying a slow gruesome death is a small token to pay to avoid Justin Timberlake 1999 hair.</li>
    <li> This pomade has a moderately strong hold.  It can be difficult to apply if your hair isn&#x27;t wet though, especially if you have thin hair like myself...so it is best to use immediately after showering.  One of the nice things about this is that it is water soluble, so it comes out very easily.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or oily looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Hopa so have a mixed asian and european mop.....I find Fiber Grease awesome with a shiny hold...a dab will do ya if you have short hair.... only downside is waiting 2 weeks for delivery from Japan... but this is worth it and the cost is fine since it lasts a long time... a dab will do ya</li>
    <li> Having a hard time finding this now, but when I used it I always looked Fiber Cool!</li>
    <li> Was tired of having to spend an arm and a leg at a salon to purchase this product.  I love using this product and I love how long one jar will last.  A little goes a long way with this one!</li>
    <li> Best pomade ever! Won&#x27;t use anything else. No greasy build up. The product is water soluble so it washes right out with water which saves you from having to shampoo your hair daily.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair product. Pretty much the only thing that has ever given my hair the slick Mad Men look.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff is water soluble, meaning that if your hair gets messy, just run a comb under water and rearrange your hair.&lt;br /&gt;This larger size is about half the price per oz as what I used to pay at my barber. I will definitely order again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.</li>
    <li> This is the best pomade product I&#x27;ve used.  This stuff holds.  I have the crazy stupid thick Asian hair that doesn&#x27;t like to do what you want it to do and this stuff will tame that craziness.  The best part? It&#x27;s fully water soluble.  I can wash it out with no problems: no residue, no muck, no scrubbing like crazy.  And yes, even though it&#x27;s water soluble, it&#x27;ll hold all day long.    If you are Asian with short hair on the sides, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll matte down your hair (unless you use a lot of this stuff).  Maybe Cool Grease XX will do it?  I&#x27;ve never used that product from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I have long wavy thick hair.  This does nothing at all for me.  Big disappointment.  Simply disappears like nothing is there. I like the scent,  but have never used a product so lame.  $2 suave product works better than this.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been messing with the more popular pomades for the past couple of years, and I think this is hands down my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started with Layrite. I liked the smell of it, but I felt the hold was little weak. It did add a little shine to my hair though. I&#x27;ve tried Murray&#x27;s, and I would consider it my favorite if it weren&#x27;t so darn difficult to remove, since its not a water-based pomade. It is a great value for the money though. I&#x27;ve also tried others (Axe, Aussie for Men), but the holds are too weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My barber recommended the Fiber Grease to me after letting me sample some after a haircut. I was iffy on the price at first, but luckily I got it as part of a Christmas gift. Looking at how much comes in the container and after a few  uses, I&#x27;d say its definitely worth the money. It has one of the strongest holds, adds some shine to my hair, and its water-based. Though I do like the smell of Layrite, I think the Fiber Grease&#x27;s mild scent is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for shaping my pompadour-side part hybrid hairstyle. Plus the broken English on the container is a hoot.</li>
    <li> Stock up while you can! glad this stuff is on amazon it shaves at least 10.00 off store pricing. Fiber grease is in my opinion as good as it gets. It combines great hold with water based formula so it&#x27;s easy to wash out. you get a decent amount of grease for your money unlike many other new brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of waxes/pomades/etc and I have yet to find anything that will hold my hair down as well as Fiber Grease Pomade. My hair is a rather thick, and seems to have a mind of it&#x27;s own, slicking it back with a couple dabs of Fiber Grease keeps it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a slight sheen, not too shiny, not too matte; in my opinion the perfect balance. A little water on a comb and you can easily touch it up as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a day the residue is a bit oily, but after all, it is called fiber GREASE. Since it is water soluble it washes out easily without even shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is a good size, even with my thick hair and frequent use I&#x27;ll probably get ~6 months out of it, well worth the price.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are listed in Japanese, so I can&#x27;t report to the \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; or animal-friendliness of this product, but I can tell you it works great. I first bought it from the barber. I liked how it handled my hair at the barber&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I can get frustrated trying to duplicate a look, but this pomade is definitely easy to handle. The results are amazing. This is definitely a good deal, since the jar I originally bought from the barber was half the size and nearly the same price.</li>
    <li> Came quickly with out any problems.</li>
    <li> This pomade is not that strong</li>
    <li> Works real well for helmet head after a long moto ride!</li>
    <li> For hair that&#x27;s longer on top, I moved away from the matte paste I was using to a product with more shine. The water-based pomades are surprisingly fantastic. Never greasy and washes out perfectly without shampoo. I prefer this Fiber Grease to other similar products. My hair is not very thick, but theres&#x27;s a lot of it. The hold is nice but not too stiff. Looks great when I part my hair and finish the top with my fingers. Use a comb for more formal occasions. This is definitely a versitile product, so I bought a backup.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. Works well with no residue and flaking. It&#x27;s strong too for spiking the hair. I like it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s labeled as a &amp;#34;light pomade,&amp;#34; but it is not. The hold isn&#x27;t as strong as Suavecito firme, but one point that does give Fiber Grease the upper hand is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry and harden up your hair like Suavecito. It is also very malleable, so you can restyle it throughout the day with a little bit of water. This product is very predictable in a sense that you never have a &amp;#34;bad hair day&amp;#34; because it always does what you want. It is an orthodox water based pomade so it washes out easily and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fiber Grease and the other products in the Cool Grease line from Fine Cosmetics LTD of Japan are excellent water based pomades with superior styling and hold. Fiber Grease, which applies dry and gives a firm and sturdy hold is perfect for the gentleman&#x27;s or ladies short to medium length haircut and is a staple of contemporary &#x27;Barber Couture&#x27;. It can be difficult to find Fiber Grease in local barbershops or beauty supply outlets. Purchasing it from Amazon is recommended!</li>
    <li> Best pomade on the face of Earth!!!! Texture + hold + shine &amp; H²O-based???? Everything I want and it shampoos out in one wash???</li>
    <li> Have used this product before and like that it is not &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; when used on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;Holds all day and has a nice shine.</li>
    <li> i would give it 5 stars but it has one flaw....which is very minor but can be a big problem at the beach.... when ur in direct sun for even 10 minutes this stuff starts melting and i don&#x27;t mean it will run down your face but ur hair will get droopy and soft.....its not a huge problem for me because i slick my hair back so its flat....but warning for people who style there hair up..this may not be the pomade for you, i would check out swavecito instead.... but still i love this pomade and will always use it!</li>
    <li> The only product that easily spikes my hair up. The best quality. Buy it, you fool. You can reshape your hair if it gets messed up.</li>
    <li> I love it.  The smell is subtle and great !  Not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;The hold is great too. It is easy to work with and it washes out easy with water in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again and again.</li>

    <li> it has a bizarre texture , overall ... I like it and would buy it again... washes out well, able to create many styles.. good buy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Holds spiked hair but water soluble so washes out easily. Use to finish styling.  Separates and adds definition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this water basd fiber product in my short thin hair for years. It gives it body and style, and even if you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day, you can refresh it without it weighing your hair down. Washes out easily with shampoo and water. And you only need about a tablespoon for a short hair doo - style or spikes or curls. Cool!</li>
    <li> After a life long search of trying to find a product that will let me style my thick hair, I have found it. All other pomades/waxes just did not have the hold to manage my thick hair, but this stuff gets it done. The best part is it washes out really easily and it lasts you a while. One of these little guys lasted me basically a year from purchase after nearly daily use.</li>
    <li> Like the fact that it is water-based and not leaving wax in my hair. Works just fine for me with a medium hold.</li>
    <li> I am Asian and have thick straight black hair. No gel, wax, or pomade had worked for me before (keeping hair straight and the way I style it in the morning). I went to a local old school barbershop and they introduced this to me, so I had prior knowledge of the stuff before ordering it. Its not too sticky in the conventional sense, has a pleasant sweet, Juicy Fruit-esque aroma, and washes out easily as it is water based. They make a matte version that comes in a blue container of the same form factor. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great pomade if you have straight asian hair like me. I like it because it washes out well and you don&#x27;t need that much. After putting it in damp hair, I put a little water on my hands and you can then style/comb it whatever way you want! A must buy if you have thin straight hair.</li>
    <li> The consistency was different  than usual...but such a good value.</li>
    <li> This is the only product my boyfriend will use on his hair. He has thick, curly/wavy hair. It is natural looking, and not too greasy</li>
    <li> A friend turned me on to this pomade and after I tried it I must agree it is a great quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the best hair pomade I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance and sheen is great, doesn&#x27;t clump up and washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I still prefer to use Suavecito Pomade (also water based) for the simple facts that it&#x27;s locally made&lt;br /&gt;(Socal vs Japan), relatively inexpensive (~$10 vs ~$30 for Fiber Grease) and ships fast (a couple of days vrs ~20 days&lt;br /&gt;for Fiber Grease).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the price and availability where the same, no doubt I would choose Fiber Grease.</li>
    <li> Using it for years. Remember one thing when using this product, less is more. 1 jar of this will last me over a year.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Best out there. Lasts me a long time and gets here quick. I have tried many gels and this by far is the best!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. There is nothing like this product out there. Viva Japan made products. Authentic japanese stuff.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this particular one I bought recently was not the same as the old ones I had before. It wasn&#x27;t as thick, it felt like the ingredients was manipulated maybe added water. I&#x27;m not sure what it is. I was a little disappointed. this kinda makes me not buy online because you just never know who to vendor is. oh well!</li>
    <li> The hold could be a bit firmer. But I do like this stuff. It smells like fresh Macintosh apples. And I dig that it washes out of my hair completely. I&#x27;m a white guy with really thick hair so I need a lot of hold because my hair is easily weighed down. I still use a small amount of Murray&#x27;s pomade for a little extra hold here and there. But this stuff provides for a great base and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It was as expected.  It was recommended by a friend.</li>
    <li> I am afraid they will stop making this. If they do I need to get a 10 year supply of it.</li>
    <li> Not much needs to be said, if you are here chances you already have used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely perfection. Do not hesitate in purchasing.</li>
    <li> instantly threw all my old products in the trash can.</li>
