      <li>/&gt;This is waaay better than using trays or strips.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>But it also made my teeth more brittle.</li>
      <li>last thing that is awesome about this is that the bleaching ingredient is hydrogen peroxide, so if you ever get canker sores in your mouth</li>
      <li>and I LOVE pineapple)</li>
      <li>Love this product and there&#x27;s nothing better out there.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Aside from that, I love the taste.</li>
      <li>Make sure you follow the directions and don&#x27;t take more than two cap fulls</li>
      <li>so I never gargled it for more than a minute or two.</li>
      <li>On top of it, you are not supposed to eat/drink for 30 mins after rinsing so you can&#x27;t use water to immediately swish out the taste and bubble residue.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was using a Creast teeth whitening mouthwash, and it was OK, but I noticed that this was working better for him</li>
      <li>Tastes like garbage and didnt work any better than the colgate brand I bought from Target before.  </li>
      <li>Works better alongside a whitening toothpaste.</li>

      <li>I absolutely LOVE this mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Love the taste and results</li>
      <li>16 ounces is perfect, especially if you want to save counter space in your bathroom.  </li>
      <li>I have tried several teeth whitening products and this is the best.  </li>
      <li>it were more affordable on Amz</li>
      <li>I already feel better about my teeth.</li>
      <li>This mouthwash is the perfect compliment to a toothpaste with the same name, Rembrandt.</li>
      <li>it works much better than the others I&#x27;ve tried (given each one a month to see results no bias)</li>
      <li>May be it would be a lot more noticeable if it was used by itself, without the toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>and what an adorable bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve gotten used to the product.</li>
      <li>I like this more than crest or Listerine whitening</li>
      <li>Continued use &#x3D; more whitening.</li>

      <li>As far as whitening my teeth, I&#x27;m just not seeing a great change.</li>
      <li>The Listerine whitening mouthwash is superior and much cheaper.</li>
      <li>amazing right?</li>
      <li>it got way too full in my mouth!</li>
      <li>Your mouth will improve in health and appearance very quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff has really improved my teeth. I love the fact that you only have to use a little bit and that saves on overall expense.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a mouthwash that won&#x27;t burn my mouth or leave me not able to taste foods for hours, so far this seems to have fit the bill. It&#x27;s pretty mild, nothing like using listerine at all. It leaves your mouth really foamy for a while after, but I haven&#x27;t yet had the problem of it leaving my tongue not able to taste foods like some others that I&#x27;ve tried. I can&#x27;t really comment yet on the whitening power, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference just yet. (I use sonicare brush and crest glamourous white toothpaste)</li>
    <li> I purchased this almost a year ago and never received it. Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Its been almost a month using this 2 times a day and I have not noticed a change in my teeth color and my teeth are not even that yellow!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it it was so bad I had to spit it out immediately.  I used it for a few weeks though, and I think I saw a slight improvement in my tooth color.  The burning sensation I felt the first time became more and more tolerable.  I began to have a concern that I was destroying my sense of taste; if the burning didn&#x27;t bother me as much, there must be a reason.  I stopped for that reason alone (maybe I&#x27;m being overly cautious, but I didn&#x27;t want to mess around with that sort of thing).</li>
    <li> I read somewhere that the Listerine whitening brand has the same ingredients for a cheaper price. I can&#x27;t see that the Listerine brand has any flouride. I have braces (yes, as an adult - so fun) and need the flouride, so I purchased this. First of all, it is pricey. Secondly, it&#x27;s a small bottle! The taste is good though and it does seem to keep the stains of my elastics, which is a plus since I like to drink lots of coffee. I think it is a good product, but definitely could use more for the money.</li>
    <li> Good daily tool for keeping a bright smile.  However, this is not the answer for dazzling white teeth.  If you struggle with maintaining white teeth as I do, this will help on a day-to-day basis.  I use the trays and whitening gel every week or two and also use this every day to keep the coffee, tea, etc. stains from accumulating too quickly.  It slows down the stain accumulation so that you don&#x27;t have to use the gel so often, as such it is a valuable part of my overall program.  Just don&#x27;t expect this to be the only product you need for that Hollywood white smile.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mouthwash for the past 3 years along with the Rembrandt toothpaste.  My teeth are noticeable whiter and everyone always asks if I had my teeth whitened.  I believe these because of the Rembrandt products I use along with my Sonicare, my teeth are the way they are because of these products.  Event my cleanings at the Dentist don&#x27;t even take the full half hour anymore.</li>
    <li> I have tried Listerine &amp; Act. Liked Act much better than Listerine, but wanted to try something for teeth whitening. I came across this product on Amazon and read mostly good reviews so decided to try it for myself. Not only does it whiten your teeth, but it leaves your whole mouth feeling/looking fresh and clean. :) Never will I be going back to any other mouthwash. This definitely helped improve my breath, gums and teeth altogether. So I will be an avid Rembrandt product user &amp; this one is definitely worth purchasing in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Whitens fairly effectively and the results get better with each use. The bottle is small (2 cups worth) compared to larger sized Crest and Listerine whitening rinses, but about 2 capfuls are necessary with each brushing session so it can last awhile. It has a similar flavor to Listerine Vibrant white and bubbles up in your mouth instantaneously. Keeps your mouth feeling fresh for some time after use as well.</li>
    <li> I really like this mouthwash. Nice white teeth don&#x27;t run in my family so I&#x27;ve always been a little self conscious of my smile. I&#x27;ve only used this a few times and I can see right off the bat that it is very effective at removing stains and discoloration. I already feel better about my teeth. After rinsing, the enamel feels smoother and somehow healthier. I would say it took my teeth a shade or two whiter and I&#x27;m pleased with the improvement. I can only compare the product to Listerine&#x27;s whitening mouthwash which didn&#x27;t seem to have much of an effect on the color of my teeth. I look for this frequently on the shelves at drugstores but they never seem to carry it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Listerine, Crest, Colgate, Scope, etc...the Rembrandt concoction seems to be perfect.  It really keeps your mouth fresh, even after you eat (1-2 hours later).  I&#x27;ve used 1 bottle so far in about 2 months, and my teeth are noticeable smoother and a little whiter.  It&#x27;s not night and day, but regardless, I can still tell.    I also like the size of the bottle.  16 ounces is perfect, especially if you want to save counter space in your bathroom.  It&#x27;s also easy to transport, should you need to take it on a trip.    You won&#x27;t be sorry...this stuff really works.</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash!  It has just the right amount of peroxide that doesn&#x27;t taste bitter and yet you know it&#x27;s there because your mouth sort of foams.  It is working to keep your mouth clean and your teeth white.  I love it.  I look for it always at stores, but not always available everywhere.  When I saw this offer in Amazon, what a great price.  I quickly jumped to take advantage of the savings.  It is a little expensive in the stores with no discounts, but you get what you pay for.  Best, is all I can say.</li>
    <li> Rembrandt Deeply White Whitening Mouthwash has not shown much whitening power after one month but the taste leaves my mouth clean and refreshed for hours.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth about a week after I started using this product. However, this mouthwash made my gums so sore and sensitive. I don&#x27;t typically have sensitive gums, but I had to stop using this product because it hurt to brush my teeth or even touch my gums.</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash whitening, Works good with paired with a toothpaste whitener. I would use this again, Price is good, Rembrandt is good in my books</li>
    <li> too expensive, done with Rembrandt!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had very white teeth, but noticed about a month back that some of my teeth on the side of my mouth were failing me a little. I found this product at a local big box store and tried it. It works! I noticed a difference within the week.</li>
    <li> A little expensive and hard to find in stores but the product itself is excellent and produced very good results.</li>
    <li> this stuff BURNS like fire, but works really well. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the only source of whitening I use because I have weak enamel. It whitens my teeth immediately the next day. I use it at night before bed and wake up with whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> Definitely whitens your teeth and stuff, didn&#x27;t care for it much though and I think it&#x27;s made my teeth sensitive so I had to toss it eventually.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I will do a rinse with this after brushing my teeth every so often, or more often if it&#x27;s before an event I&#x27;d like to have white teeth for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is waaay better than using trays or strips. For one, the gel in trays and strips is uncomfortable and a pain to deal with, sitting around with gross sticky crud in your mouth trying not to swallow it for what feels like ages. With this, it&#x27;s just a minute of swishing and done! Also, with the trays and strips, I get teeth and gum sensitivity but this mouthwash is much more gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause pain (unless you use it a ton, which I&#x27;ve had happen once, but I just dialed it back a bit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This REALLY works. If you rinse with this stuff for like 4 days in a row you&#x27;re going to have noticeably whiter teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing that is awesome about this is that the bleaching ingredient is hydrogen peroxide, so if you ever get canker sores in your mouth (I tend to get these if I eat pineapple and I LOVE pineapple), rinsing with this will also help heal the sores! Win-win!</li>
    <li> This is great mouthwash!  I was a Crest user, but will not go back anymore!  :)  This makes my teeth feel so clean and my breath fresh!</li>
    <li> I used this along with whitening toothpaste and whitestrips and I found that it worked just as well as other whitening mouthwashes, and it was cheaper.  You do have to get used to the weird foaminess of it, but the taste is ok and it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> I use this with Rembrandt&#x27;s intense white strips and toothpaste. It can get a little weird as it foams in your mouth, but the peroxide in it does a great job of helping to whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product, my brother recommended me to this. I was using a Creast teeth whitening mouthwash, and it was OK, but I noticed that this was working better for him, so I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> Wow, this mouthwash leaves such a clean healthy feeling to my mouth after using, yes it is a bit spendy, but you need barely any each time, so it lasts longer than you think. I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> The Listerine whitening mouthwash is superior and much cheaper.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOUTHWASH.NO HARSH TASTE LIKE OTHER PRODUCTS, AND REMBRANDT PRODUCTS (INCLUDING THE TOOTHPASTE ARE VERY HIGH QUALITY.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but I am not seeing the results. I was skeptical about a whitening rinse (that is suppose to change the color of my teeth) getting on my tongue, but I guess it is like any other mouthwash. It is definitely on my breath throughout the day. As far as whitening my teeth, I&#x27;m just not seeing a great change. Maybe by the end of the bottle things might be different, but I still see where my teeth are yellow close to the gums. Seriously considering whitening strips, but I&#x27;ll give this until the end of the bottle first. Hopefully positive change is coming.</li>
    <li> I used to use this particular months ago when Amazon had it readily in stock and when the supply that I ordered ran out, I stocked up on Crest and Listerine whitening mouthwashes. After having gone through those and returned back to Rembrandt Deeply White, I have came to the conclusion that it is indeed the best whitening mouthwash on the market. Both Crest and Listerine did nearly nothing for me when coupled with Crest 3D Vivid White toothpaste (my toothpaste of choice). I have used the same method for all whitening mouthwashes when rinsing, and this is squish 2tbps for 60-90 seconds and don&#x27;t rinse with water afterwards or drink any liquids for the preceding 30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stains that I had from drinking loads of coffee started to fade away in as little as three days of rinsing with Rembrandt Deeply white for twice a day and I don&#x27;t have to use any whitening gels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and highly recommend it for anyone who sincerely wants to whitening their teeth. It is also important to note that the instructions must be followed precisely to guarantee the best results.</li>
    <li> Personally, I like the taste &amp; I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it &amp; does have fluoride &amp; hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it were more affordable on Amz but until then I buy at BB&amp;B with the 20% coupon for $5.60.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and leaves my breathe fresh. But be warned it is strong and it will burn if you take too much. It always leave my mouth feeling really clean though.</li>
    <li> Strong ingredients, not for sensitive palates.  It does enhance your whiteness but it burns and irritates sensitive teeth and palates.</li>
    <li> Speedy shipment.  Wishbthey had 32 ozs...however,  Good product.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks, your teeth are noticeably brighter and whiter.  The sensation the mouthwash gives you (almost a chemical burning) takes a little getting used to but you get used to it.  A \\&quot;highly recommend\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Works better alongside a whitening toothpaste. On its own, it takes a few months to notice a difference. But with a toothpaste, it took about 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> After switching from regular Listerine, it took a while to adapt to this mouthwash. The mint flavor does not completely hide the distinct peroxide taste. In addition, the peroxide also causes some bubbling in the mouth. On top of it, you are not supposed to eat/drink for 30 mins after rinsing so you can&#x27;t use water to immediately swish out the taste and bubble residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this, I love this product! Why? Because it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, it leaves my mouth clean feeling (after the bubbling dissipates) and noticeably whitens after a single use. Continued use &#x3D; more whitening. I no longer use white strips or occasional bleachings. The bottle is a bit smaller than I am used to, but it lasts me about a month. I use an old medicine cup so I&#x27;m using the amount I&#x27;m supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product because it&#x27;s the most effective way to keep my teeth sparkly white and my mouth fresh &amp; clean. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve gotten used to the product.</li>
    <li> I selected this product because rembrandt has quality teeth products. This whitener excels. I use it 3 times daily, and have fantastic white teeth.</li>
    <li> nice price and works well.. during the fall and spring I&#x27;m in school so i dink coffee almost 4 times a day. THE YELLOWING FROM DAILY COFFEE DRINKING IS UNAVOIDABLE . if anything you should cut back on your coffee I&#x27;m down to 1 cup a day 2 if I need it. anyway I started seeing results within 2 weeks amazing right? cut back on caffeine and soda and use this and you should be white again in a month or 2 provided you follow instructions. it works much better than the others I&#x27;ve tried (given each one a month to see results no bias)</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth like other types.  It leaves a clean feeling in my mouth although I prefer to rinse tight after using it.</li>
    <li> Best whitening rinse I have ever used, the only one I can find that actually works!</li>
    <li> This product gets REALLY frothy and foamy as you swish it around (maybe it&#x27;s the peroxide?) to the point that it makes me gag a little.  Also you are not supposed to eat or drink anything for one hour after using, which is reasonable except i was just dying to rinse my mouth out with water after I spit out the mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;The taste itself is fine, good even, but the foaminess is unpleasant.  I may try to stick it out and see if the results are worth it but I do not look forward to using this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband ~ he really likes it and has asked me to put it on Auto Delivery (he&#x27;s never requested that before!). He&#x27;s been using it for a couple of months now and I really do believe that his teeth look whiter and brighter!</li>
    <li> Not a bad product.  Great for the price.  My teeth are noticeably a few shades whiter after about two weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only giving this 4 stars because it tastes pretty bad and leaves a kind of thick gunky residue on the tongue after use.  It&#x27;s definitely mint flavored, but it&#x27;s not very strong.  Wouldn&#x27;t advise you to use it in anticipation of a makeout session....</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t done alot of shopping around, but began using for the benefits of fluoride to fight plaque, seems to be a good price online, best I found and with S&amp;S and Prime benefits, always a better deal.</li>
    <li> First: I wanted to like this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My background: I brush and floss twice a day. I use the Rembrandt Deeply White fresh mint toothpaste and have been using it for the past few years with no problems (see my separate review for the Rembrandt winter mint toothpaste). I do love the Rembrandt toothpaste, it whitens and also does fight cavities, in fact I&#x27;ve only been to the dentist in the past few years due to routine cleaning, nothing more. Needless to say, I had high hopes for the mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I expected: I wanted my teeth to be whitened a bit more, mostly. The fresh breath wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but would be nice. I also liked how there was fluoride in the mouthwash which was claimed to \\&quot;strengthen enamel.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened: Yes, it works for whitening teeth. I noticed a difference within a few days. It was pretty impressive. However, due to how my teeth were already quite white, the difference wasn&#x27;t anything spectacular. Just a nice shade whiter. Those with more yellow teeth, as is the case with most whitening products, are likely to see bigger results.The mouthwash also helps keep my teeth smooth. Freshening my breath? Ehh...it does but really not extremely so. In fact, I&#x27;d say that Listerine would probably do a better job if you just wanted fresh breath. It didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive, either. But for strengthening enamel? On to that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ugly: After using the mouthwash for about a month and a half (used it twice a day, two capfuls as prescribed on the label for 1min. exactly), I had two bad experiences. First, when biting down on a somewhat tough bagel, my front tooth came down and chipped off a small piece of one of my bottom teeth. Second, while eating a strawberry, one of the seeds got stuck between my two front teeth where some cosmetic work had been done...it cracked one of my teeth! Not to the point where it caused pain, but there&#x27;s a crack on the inside and it&#x27;s now very difficult to floss between my two front teeth. It may be a result of using the Rembrandt toothpaste with the mouthwash and having too much peroxide overall, but the routine made my teeth very brittle. Moreover, Rembrandt does recommend using their own Deeply White toothpaste in tandem with this mouthwash. Funny enough, I was particularly keen to try this mouthwash as there is no alcohol in it, but it seems to have not mattered much. I have no idea how much peroxide is actually in this stuff, perhaps it&#x27;s too much. So I ended up with a chipped tooth and a cracked tooth within a week of each other. That&#x27;s when I stopped using the mouthwash. Keep in mind I&#x27;ve never chipped or cracked a tooth before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterthoughts: My teeth were already quite white to begin with and I just wanted to get them a bit nicer. Yes, the product made them a bit whiter. But it also made my teeth more brittle. I do bleach my teeth using professional grade gel, but that is once every half a year, and the last time I bleached was months ago, so I doubt that had much to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price: isn&#x27;t killer, just $5 a bottle here on amazon and free super saver shipping. Considering the damage it caused to my teeth, not exactly the deal of the century with how much dental work costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: It does whiten teeth, and slightly freshen breath, but it doesn&#x27;t strengthen enamel. If anything, it WEAKENS enamel. Again, it may just be my regimen. Because of the brittle teeth issue, however, I cannot recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Any comments on how things could have been better are certainly welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I contacted Rembrandt who promptly got back to me, and I spoke with a very kind representative over the phone about the issue. They provided the option to refund my money which I chose, and I&#x27;m very impressed by this customer service. Debating bumping this review up to three stars due to their stellar customer service.</li>
    <li> It is really whitened my teeth!  I have noticed the difference just after a few days of using that product.</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff,makes the chompers bright and white and replaces the paint</li>
    <li> nice i like it. willing to purchase next time. thank you very much. as the as i expect. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Tastes like garbage and didnt work any better than the colgate brand I bought from Target before.  It does work its just pretty expensive for something colgate and crest make that works just as well and tons cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth, but this teeth whitening product was not bothersome. At first my teeth hurt a little bit, but as it rebuilds enamel, teeth get used to it. It definitely does whiten. I saw considerable improvement especially in the yellowing on teeth near the gums. I would use it once or twice a day, sometimes everyday, other times just a few days a week, and it was effective each time.</li>
    <li> The taste isnt great, but the product is! paired with a good brushing etc, this wash is the final step in adding a nice fresh sparkle to your mouth</li>
    <li> Excellent Mint flavor. Very smooth and fresh feeling. Not a strong pungent alcohol kick like some other brands we know of.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best mouth wash by far.  It is worth the price because it works!  It really does whiten teeth!</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonder.  I have been using it for two months now and within a few weeks, I can already see a difference in my teeth. My family members have noticed how whitening my teeth look. I will definitely keep using it. A little pricey for half of the amount (16oz bottle) compared to the other brands but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Lets be honest, everyone wants healthy white teeth, and outside of spending money on harsh teeth whitening processes at the dentist, the average person wants something that works, is within budget, and easy.  This mouthwash does wonders when combined with normal tooth brushing.  That said don&#x27;t expect whiter teeth (unless your a heavy smoker/coffee drinker) without brushing your teeth twice a day and using this.  My wife noticed that my teeth were looking whiter after a few weeks of using this product twice a day (once in morning, once before bed).  I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;ll ever get the &#x27;Hollywood&#x27; white from this but I have noticed the yellowing from mild coffee drinking and tea has started to fade.    If your looking for a whiter, healthier smile, that fits within your budget, helps to keep your mouth and teeth clean,then invest a few dollars in Rembrandt&#x27;s mouthwash and see what you think after a month.</li>
    <li> I bought this mouthwash because of the positive reviews. I have only been using the mouthwash for about two weeks (not necessarily twice a day either), but I am starting to notice some good results. My teeth are beginning to look whiter and some of the hard-to-reach stains are less noticeable. The taste is decent and it doesn&#x27;t burn as bad as some other mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> I have tried several teeth whitening products and this is the best.  It is probably also the cheapest, an added bonus.  Why spend tons of money and time when its as easy as this.  One minute after you brush your teeth two times a day and you will  see results in the whiteness of your teeth.  I get complitments all the time, no need to try anything else.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best whitening rinse I&#x27;ve tried, even though it is too expensive. The problem is that it burns more than any other mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used. That includes Listerine. It must be the peroxide, but I can&#x27;t keep it in very long before I have to spit it out. I suppose it would super whiten if I could keep it in the amount it says to but I would guess that the longest I&#x27;ve manged thus far would be about 15 seconds. I got it at an extremely discounted price with an extra coupon off, and if I can continue getting that rate I will keep using it, otherwise I will stick to Crest Complete. I may not blind anyone with my smile, but my mouth won&#x27;t be on fire at 5am anymore either!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 straight weeks and have to say that I have not seen a noticeable difference. I started a couple days after a routine dentist cleaning and have followed the directions (10ml for a minute, twice a day after brushing with no eating 30 minutes after). I even have started brushing and flossing after every meal to help things along. Plus I have replaced my regular toothbrush with a spin brush to ensure an even better clean. Alas no real difference from the mouthwash and I attribute my healthier gums to my revised flossing and brushing efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is alright, not bad actually. Although by the 40th second it does start to burn. The real disappointment is that you have to use this stuff twice a day which is double other products on the market and it still does not seem to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it three stars for trying and will continue to use the product until the bottle finishes to see what happens. My advice: only buy it if you can get it at the add-on price.</li>
    <li> The item arrived rapidly. It was very beneficial to me and I am looking forward to dealing with you again soon!</li>
    <li> This mouthwash does it all without burn. I hate burn!!&lt;br /&gt;It only takes about two capfuls of this for 1 min. after you brush your teeth. Whitenens and restores/protects enamel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few whitening mouthwashes, all of them alcohol-free, and this Rembrandt is my favorite.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, twice a day, and it makes my teeth glow (added bonus is the fluoride! so don&#x27;t eat or drink for 30 minutes after using this).  I drink 4 cups of tea a day but I have orthodontic braces and therefore can&#x27;t use whitening strips, so the whitening mouthwash is the way to go for me.  I don&#x27;t think this stuff burns - only if I&#x27;ve recently burned my tongue on hot food, *then* this mouthwash kinda irritates the burned tongue.  And it&#x27;s the most pleasant tasting whitening mouthwash I&#x27;ve used (Optic White was the worst!).  It foams up a LOT but that&#x27;s the nature of the whitening mouthwash, they all do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it, and I&#x27;ll keep buying it.  It&#x27;s currently $5 here on Amazon and I don&#x27;t mind at all that it&#x27;s an \\&quot;add-on item\\&quot; because this mouthwash is $7.50 in my local drugstore.  Nice bit of savings here.</li>
    <li> The only negative to this product is that it&#x27;s expensive, but then again, it&#x27;s the only one like it, so maybe it&#x27;s expensive for a reason. And $5 on amazon is a great price, it&#x27;s often $8 in the store. But you really can&#x27;t ask for more. Whitening. Has Flouride. Alcohol-Free!!! and what an adorable bottle. But not only that, but it actually *does* whiten. If you have very yellow teeth, buy some Plus White 5 Minute Bleach to go with it, but if you have already light teeth and want a nice pick me up, this will do it. It&#x27;s just about perfect. Yes rembrandt had possibly an even better one in the past, but honestly, I&#x27;ve used Rembrandt rinses since they started making them and maybe they were stronger? But maybe not. Love this product and there&#x27;s nothing better out there. Cheaper out there, yes, but not better. For even great whitening, pick up a whitening booster for your toothpaste, Arm &amp; hammer and Plus White both make one.</li>
    <li> Just keep using as directed, and you&#x27;ll notice a difference.  It took about a week before I slowly noticing my teeth were whiter.  Of course, you should practice general oral health maintenance by brushing your teeth at least twice daily and floss as well to see better results.</li>
    <li> would drink it if I could. much preferred to market leaders. almost no sting but still leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the Rembrandt products...compared to other major whitening toothpaste and mouthwash brands, this product stands up to their brand. I am a HUGE tea drinker (3-4) cups a day and also drink cranberry juice - after brushing my teeth I can literally see the discoloration rinse in the sink and my teeth becomes 2 shades whiter. A little bit more extra strength...will have my teeth glistening white!!!</li>
    <li> great addition to the toothpaste - would give it 5 stars if not so expensive</li>
    <li> A girl I know swears by this stuff; she smokes and drinks a ton (of everything, coffee, tea, soda, booze) and her teeth are very white. I found it at the Rite Aid two blocks from my house, but next time I&#x27;ll buy off Amazon. I bought the accompanying toothpaste, too, and am using a [[ASIN:B003QYFVRY Philips Sonicare HX5351/30 Essence 5300 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] which makes a huge difference on its own, and which I just got because I&#x27;m in the middle of an extensive 6 month dental work spree (root canals and crowns, cavities) which is totally my fault for not having good brushing or (more importantly), flossing habits. I also got a [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]], and that thing is amazing. People are complaining about some dumb things here: Yes, it is going to sting a little, it&#x27;s hydrogen peroxide, seriously do you expect angels to dance in your mouth? Secondly, there is no measuring cup but, yes, two cap fulls is two tea spoons. And thirdly, it works. It whitens your teeth. Do not think it will turn a yellow mouth sparkling overnight, but I noticed results immediately, and I smoke and drink tea. And I think that&#x27;s also because I&#x27;m using the paste (which has 4x the fluoride of average toothpaste) as well as hydrogen peroxide, which is practically the amount of fluoride in my PRESCRIPTION toothpaste. And for the fact that it&#x27;s $33, there&#x27;s really no excuse not to get the sonicare. It&#x27;s completely night and day and it whitens on it&#x27;s own. If you want to whiten at home, then use Sonicare, the Rembrant mouthwash, the toothpaste, and get a waterpik while you&#x27;re at it. Your mouth will improve in health and appearance very quickly. My dentist noticed the difference in color and gum health after 1 week. Sort it!</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash! Does its job well</li>
    <li> In a nutshell:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Actually whitens teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Too abrasive. Erodes mouth tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product after reading so many good reviews about it. One problems others have noted already is the lack of a measuring cup to know how much 10mL really is. Nevertheless, I used the product exactly as the directions instructed, gargling the mouthwash for a minute, once in the morning and once in the night after brushing my teeth, and not eating or drinking anything for the following 30 minutes. I followed this regimen for a little after a week, and already began to notice the whitening effect. During the next few days, however, my mouth began to hurt, and I started spitting out bits of what I thought was food during the 30 minutes after I gargled the mouthwash. I was actually spitting out bits of my gum. I immediately stopped using the mouthwash, but different parts of my mouth was already raw as top layers of my gum were stripped off, and it took more than week for it to finally heal. I might just be a lot more sensitive to the chemicals in the Rembrandt mouthwash than most other people are, but Rembrandt products are known to be a LOT more abrasive than others. For me, this cons heavily outweighs the pros. I would go for a safer mouthwash, even if the whitening effects may take longer to kick in.</li>
    <li> I have had good luck with this, it really does work, after a few weeks you will see the difference.</li>
    <li> I really did enjoy using this product it did make my teeth whiter unfortunately I had to stop because of my Kidney Transplant.</li>
    <li> I am a heavy coffee drinker, and this worked great for getting rid of those stains. I rinse three to four times a week, and it still works good. The bottle recommends using it twice a day, but it&#x27;s working great for me using it less frequently. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to some friends.</li>
    <li> My kids like this mouthwash better than anything else on the market.  The taste is good, it whitens well, and it leaves your mouth feeling fresh. They even use it for soaking their retainers, since it helps keep them fresh and stain-free.</li>
    <li> I have used many products for teeth whitening before such as Whitening Strips (which works), Listerine mouth wash (Ehh so so), Crest 3D Mouthwash (this works well with the strips), and Whitening toothpaste, but nothing seems to get that yellowish color near the roots of my teeth. Rembrandt did the job, after 2 weeks of using it (2 times a day) I started to notice that the yellowish spots on my teeth that no other products can get rid of are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was complimented on how white my teeth were after the first use of it and people were wondering what product I used. Sadly it was a short term effect, but after using it for 2 weeks+ I&#x27;m starting to see some permanent effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Recommended.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this mouthwash and decided to try it anyhow. Whoever complained about the taste must not want white teeth very much. Who cares what it taste like if your teeth get visibly whiter. By the way, the taste doesn&#x27;t bother me. I will be a regulat consumer of this product.</li>
    <li> I like this more than crest or Listerine whitening</li>
    <li> Love the taste and results</li>
    <li> Tastes good in comparison to similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rembrandt is expensive but I have always found them worth the extra couple bucks.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It still works despite me drinking coffee nearly everyday. If I didn&#x27;t, my teeth would definitely be whiter than they are now.</li>
    <li> Whomever described this mouthwash as cough syrup with hydrogen peroxide, a slight bite and mint aftertaste has the palette of a connoisseur. I do have to add though that anyone that has used Listerine will find this is actually slightly more palatable and does not have as much of a &#x27;sting&#x27; as you get with Listerine.  I also found that with Listerine, even when I scraped my tongue afterwards and then gargled again, it was almost like five minutes later my breath was worse. I think it had to do with killing the good bacteria in my mouth or something, but I do not have that aftereffect with this mouthwash and your breath feels pretty fresh, even hours later. Make sure you follow the directions and don&#x27;t take more than two cap fulls (you can use a medicine cup if you need), but because it does foam up, you don&#x27;t want to have to be spitting a ton of it out. When I tried other mouthwashes that foamed up, they tasted strongly of hydrogen peroxide and made me gag and also foamed up uncontrollably. I did not experience that with this mouth wash as the hydrogen peroxide taste is not overwhelming and while you feel it foam in your mouth when you&#x27;re gargling to get that whitening, it didn&#x27;t make me gag. (I also have a really strong gag reflex, so that&#x27;s saying something.) I did follow the directions and not rinse and keep it in my mouth for 30 minutes afterwards and despite my coffee addiction, my teeth are noticeably whiter. I have the results I&#x27;d normally get with Crest White strips, but without the gum &amp; teeth sensitivity I&#x27;d normally get with it. It did take a few weeks to get to that Crest strip 3D level of white though and it removed surface stains that I don&#x27;t think the Crest strips would have done.  Maybe I&#x27;m attributing too much to this mouthwash, but I did have a sensitive spot on my gum and after a few days rinsing with this mouth wash twice a day, I no longer had that sensitivity.  Bottom line, this product does exactly what it says it does and does it well. It doesn&#x27;t taste great, but it&#x27;s not as harsh as Listerine and works a lot better. I&#x27;ve tried Crest mouthwash too and while that doesn&#x27;t sting like Listerine, it didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective. This product is better than all the others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> if you want your teeth to be white, you should use the whitening toothpaste and this mouthwash, i tried so many, but this one is by far the best, you see the results within a week. And it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth!</li>
    <li> Fresh breath- no change in teeth whitening for me. However - it&#x27;s a good mouth wash, just would get scope next time.</li>
    <li> I feel a deep sympathy for the Amazon store, and a great pleasure for me to participate in the survey. This product has pleased me with their quality and great obemom.Budu book yet.</li>
    <li> As far as mouthwash goes, it is my opinion this is somewhat effective at teeth whitening.  The taste is not horrible. However, I waffle between using this effective mouthwash and Listerine, because it is also my opinion that if a girl smells Listerine on your breath your intentions are more obvious.  I owe a bedding or two to Listerine, however less effective than this product I subscribe to purchasing off Amazon is.</li>
    <li> I was feeling a bit self-conscious about the shade of my teeth (I drink too much coffee) so I wanted to whiten my teeth without spending a fortune, and since I was looking for some new mouthwash anyway, I ordered a bottle of Rembrandt. I am definitely ordering more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few weeks of using it, I can see my teeth getting lighter. Not a huge difference yet, but any difference looks great to me. Aside from that, I love the taste. It&#x27;s very mild, just minty enough, and it&#x27;s pleasant. I definitely recommend it. :)</li>
    <li> I used it twice a day for about two weeks and my teeth developed severe sensitivity to hot and cold. I cut back to once a day and the sensitivity was better but still uncomfortable. I now use it just a couple of times a week to try to maintain as much of the teeth whitening benefits as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth aren&#x27;t normally oversensitive but I can&#x27;t bite in to ice cream or anything frozen without experiencing discomfort and whitening products of all kinds have always caused extra sensitivity for me.</li>
    <li> Hope this helps me whiten my teeth .....</li>
    <li> Great product - gentle and effective! I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for several months and my teeth are noticeably whiter with no sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Liked it and noticed whitening of the teeth. However, it was too harsh for my mouth and I will not be using it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and I really like it.  It is gentle and it works!  What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I love that the product does what it says.  Whitens teeth DRAMATICALLY.  I was prompted to purchase this because my dentist told me I needed a fluoride rinse, this did the trick while at the same time make my teeth shine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mouthwash. I used it a few years ago when I lived rite near Walgreen&#x27;s. Unfortunately after I moved, none of the stores in my area carried it. Yay for Amazon lol. The taste isn&#x27;t too much for me the way Listerine can be. It does get kinda foamy after a little while of swishing, but it has peroxide in it, so I expect it. I find my teeth looking slightly better just after a few days (AM and PM). I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> With continued use, this whitens your teeth a couple shades. Its great because it doesnt hurt your gums and teeth like other products. It&#x27;s not strong like other mouth washes and it tastes like mint which is pleasant. The only bad thing about this is that you can&#x27;t eat or drink anything for maybe half an hour or an hour after use. I usually gargle with this before bed anyway but it makes me feel a little strange. I used to always wash my mouth out with water after using Listerine but with this you&#x27;re supposed to just leave some of it sitting in your mouth which bothers me a bit..</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is the perfect compliment to a toothpaste with the same name, Rembrandt. Makes my entire mouth feel fresh. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I tried using this in conjunction with the toothpaste, but did not notice much difference, if I had only used the toothpaste.  Not seeing much difference, I stopped using it.  I tried it for about 2 weeks.  I am not sure, may be it was working, and would work if used more.  May be it would be a lot more noticeable if it was used by itself, without the toothpaste.  May be the toothpaste has &amp;#34;stolen it&#x27;s thunder.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I would recommend this mouthwash to anyone, and have.</li>
    <li> I feel much fresher and cleaner after using it. I don&#x27;t know how much it&#x27;s whitening my teeth, though. Good product.</li>
    <li> I really like this mouthwash as it doesn&#x27;t taste awful or leave a bad taste in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m not too certain how much the whitening effects took place.</li>
    <li> This is great, it&#x27;s got a good amount of fluoride (comparable to ACT and other fluoride mouthwashes), feels gentle without any burn, really, and contains no alcohol.  The whitening factor is great as well as it&#x27;s not just a surface whitener like whitening toothpaste is.  This product does as it advertises, and it does so well.  The taste is mild and enjoyable, as well, none of that overpowering burning sensation you&#x27;d expect from other products in the market.</li>
    <li> I began using this product a few months ago, after I went on a binge in trying to whiten my slightly-yellow teeth. I first used Crest white strips to do most of the work and then tried the Listerine whitening mouthwash. Though it felt strong, it wasn&#x27;t doing anything in helping the white of my teeth. I switched over to this and the whiteness I first saw after using the strips has sticked around! It&#x27;s great. It is a teeny, tiny bottle (in comparison to any Listerine), but you need not use much, since it foams up pretty well. One bottle of these usually lasts me about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> REMBRANDT IS A GOOD NAME BUT IT DOES NOT WORK AS WELL FOR BLEEDING GUMS.  I WOLD NOT BUY IT AGAIN</li>
    <li> waste of money. ineffective</li>
    <li> Seems to whiten well but burns my mouth!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this mouthwash and I was impressed. I could clearly see surface stains on my teeth had gotten lighter and my mouth was fresh. It does have a bit of hydrogen peroxide so at times my bums burned a bit so I never gargled it for more than a minute or two. I would definitely recommend this mouthwash</li>
    <li> I have been using this mouthwash for about a year now and I do notice my teeth are a lot whiter. It has a little bit of a sting like other mouthwashes but its not too bad. Bottle is easy to handle. Fits perfect in your hand.</li>
    <li> My entire life it seems, the first thing I notice about a person is their teeth...their smile.  I first tried this product a couple of years ago, and it really helped whiten my teeth!  When I noticed I could get this product through Amazon on an auto-delivery basis, I was ecstatic.  Thank you Rembrandt Deeply White Whitening Mouthwash for giving me the smile I had always admired on others!  I wouild definitely recommend this to others...and, in fact, already have several times.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this before and I&#x27;ve tried it again recently and obviously results to vary from one individual to the next. So the successes that you read about that may not be exaggerated, may be due to this product being specifically effective for that person&#x27;s teeth. This somewhat does work, like the bottle says, you do have to keep at it for at least three months. After a week or two of vigorous swishing, some people may see an improvement. My issue is with those who say this doesn&#x27;t burn. It does burn and it burns like hell. It burns so much so that I get discouraged from using it as often as it is recommended. My eyes turn red and sometimes watery, my mouth is on fire, often times my stuffed nasal canals are gasping for air, struggling to inhale oxygen and this exacerbates the problem. So it does burn. Think Listerine. Some people have a higher tolerance, others don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s why I use ACT mouthwash as my primary mouthwash and use this to whiten my teeth. People commented about the foam, the foam doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as those who&#x27;ve pointed it out. If you can withstand the burn, then you&#x27;re more likely to follow through this regimen, if you can&#x27;t withstand it, then you&#x27;re more likely to become discouraged. That&#x27;s not to say that when I want my teeth to look good for certain occasions that I deem significant enough that I won&#x27;t purchase and/or reach for this stuff, because I might.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and decided to give this product a try so I bought 2.  I followed the directions and even kept the mouthwash longer then the minute but my teeth are not any whiter.  No even a small change.  I did like the fresh mint and left my mouth fresh and minty.</li>
    <li> this is the greatest product ever. its a little expensive compared to other similar products but the results are amazing. I have ordered it twice now, will continue to use because this really does whiten teeth.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and I can definitely see a difference in how white my teeth are! I notice that a lot of my surface stains (coffee drinker) are gone when I use this at night, and it leaves my breath minty fresh throughout the whole night and day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI: You can&#x27;t eat/drink anything for 30 min after using it.  This isn&#x27;t an issue for me because my toothpaste has the same rules but it might take some getting used to if you&#x27;re not used to it.  Honestly though, who wants to have breakfast right after you&#x27;ve brushed your teeth! I also want to let you know too that you do have to swish this around in your mouth for 1 min, so don&#x27;t put too much product in your mouth because it does sort of foam up on your teeth (a good thing because it means it is working).  I put way too much product in my mouth the first time and had issues with it after about 30 seconds it got way too full in my mouth! If I were you, I&#x27;d just put a little gulp in my mouth and see how it does... because the recommended amount to use on the back was way too much for my mouth.  I might just have a small mouth though.  Also, if you don&#x27;t like minty things this might be a little intense for you to have in your mouth for 1 min because it is very minty and a little intense at first.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily burn, but it is intense and I&#x27;ve noticed that now when I don&#x27;t use AS much it isn&#x27;t as intense and it still works great.  I have also noticed that my mouth has gotten use to the intensity and it is fine after about a week of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product regardless of the intense minty sensation.  Seriously I have literally noticed surface coffee stains from the day disapear after using it at night! It was amazing to watch and this product does what it says it will!</li>
    <li> This is the only mouthwash I will buy for myself! I like to buy it with the toothpaste also! I can usually get both together for 14.00 at Walmart.</li>
