<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Extremely small bottle and it did not spray as advertised. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is not an aerosol, this product is a pump. It&#x27;s thin, applies easy, absorbs quickly and smells great. Awesome for on the run protection!</li>
    <li> Two out of my three children today were crying because it was burning their eyes. My 14 month old son broke out in an awful rash on his face from this. My kids do not have sensitive skin and have never broken out from anything before.</li>
    <li> After experimenting with several zinc-based sunscreens and disliking the pasty glue-like consistency, I tried the Alba at a friend&#x27;s suggestion. I love it! It goes on easily and quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave a pasty or oily residue. Its not zinc-based, and while the ingredients don&#x27;t exactly look &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; it still rates better on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s site than all of the other conventional sunscreens you&#x27;ll find at the drugstore. My only caveat is that the bottle is a bit small, but the little pump thing on the top works great, and I&#x27;ve come to realize that decent non oxybenzone sunscreens are worth a bit more. In fact, I just ordered some more!</li>
    <li> This has to be my favorite spray sunscreen for my 2 year old daughter.  I feel comfortable knowing that this product is chemical free and unlike some other safe sunscreens, this one is not oily and not chalky!</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen and feel better about using it on my kids in place of the many others available with so many chemicals! a little greasy but no big deal!</li>
    <li> Very easy to put on my kids&#x27; face.. it just glides. Makes the task much faster and easier during crazy morning hour rush.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. The bottle is extremely small.it would be great for a beach bag. I fear using it up within a few uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of zinc-based sunscreens over the years. This one is by far my favorite! So easy to apply that my kids don&#x27;t fuss about it; that makes for one happy momma!</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen for my toddler! Because it&#x27;s a spray it&#x27;s lightweight and rubs in nicely without leaving white residue or overly greasy skin. It has a very light scent and my daughter (who has sensitive skin) has had no problems with reactions to it.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; is not a traditional spray sunscreen.  You cannot &amp;#34;spray and go&amp;#34; with this.  If I would have realized that, I would not have purchased it, primarily because it&#x27;s the exact same thing as the other sunscreens I bought.  It squirts into your hand/skin, and you have the spread it out to rub it in.  The consistency is more liquid than my standard cream sunscreens, but not too runny.  It&#x27;s a small bottle too, and for the same thing as my regular lotion-consistency sunscreens, I might as well stick with them.  I wanted something that I could easily spray on my two-year old that was a more natural sunscreen, and this does not fulfill that requirement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited a long time : I orderd Apr.24, and I got today (May 26) BUT it leaked more than half.</li>
    <li> Goes on like smooth lotion that absorbs into the skin rather than pasty sunscreen. Spray function makes application on young ones much more convenient. The smell is also almost pleasant. My son tans easily so he has still tanned a bit this summer but no burn at all, and I feel good about applying it on his face, too.</li>
    <li> This burns horribly bad if it runs in your eyes, which it does. I&#x27;m a runner and use this before I head out the door. Most of the time I come home with red eyes that burn.</li>
    <li> Love how the lotion spreads on clear - not white like many.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply to 3 tiny children without inhaling toxic mist or ruining your day. Enough said!</li>
    <li> We have looked for a long time for a sunscreen that is easy to apply to our kids- This is the clear winner- It protects them properly, but is not akin to painting your child with a thick coat of plaster.</li>
    <li> LOVE this sunscreen. I first bought it for our baby, and now keep buying it for the whole family. I&#x27;m super pale, and this worked great all summer keeping us burn free. The texture of the lotion is really soft and light and absorbs easily. I also like that it comes in a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I would purchase this again. It did it&#x27;s job. My son is 4 with a lot of allergies and skin reactions occur often. This did not bother his skin at all. Use it at the beach between weather averages of 80-90&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Purchased this bottle 3 months ago, so it&#x27;s not old. Applied this to my 4 year old daughter 30 minutes before going out in the sun on a partly overcast/partly sunny day. Reapplied later on. It&#x27;s like she wasn&#x27;t even wearing anything. She was swimming so maybe it&#x27;s just not waterproof. Not risking it and throwing this in the trash. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Works well...not too thick or greasy.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply - I spray in my hands and apply on skin like I would daily lotion. Works great for applying to my children as it rubs in quickly. I&#x27;ve found the protection to be great, with no sunburns or even pink skin yet in the couple years we&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
    <li> I bought this to take on a beach vacation.  I am a very fair person and it kept me from getting sunburned.  Except for a couple of places where I didn&#x27;t get it rubbed on.  I reapplied regularly and it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> the freak in top broke right when i open it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. You will be very happy and you will not go back to the old suncreens</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen ever. Not stinky our sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much I use it myself as a daily lotion in the summer.  It&#x27;s amazingly lightweight, and I&#x27;ve never had issues with my toddler burning when we apply it consistently (every couple of hours or so) in high sun/water environments like the beach or pool.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the packaging and texture--easy to apply. Caution though--2 out of 3 of my kids reacted to this formula. Caused bumps and burning on face and body. It has a physical sunscreen but also contains some chemical sunscreens that are not the common ones.</li>
    <li> This rubs on smooth and is very easy to use. I will buy this again! Doesnt leave white smudges like other organic sunscreen and rubs on very easily. This will be the sunscreen we use of our kids from now on!</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found for my kids that isn&#x27;t greasy and rubs in well.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen spreads easily and the spray bottle is incredibly convenient. We used it all summer long! Not cheap, but well worth it</li>
    <li> This the best sunscreen ever.  I am a porcelain skin red head and it works great for me, my kids don&#x27;t mind me applying it to them and say it smells good and my husband who hate sunscreen has requested I only buy this.  No sticky mess, absorbs like a lotion, smells good, easy application and works in a variety of situations.</li>
    <li> Great natural sunscreen that&#x27;s not chalky or super greasy! It spreads easily and evenly and doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous sunscreens since I became a mom, and this is one of my favorites for kids.  It blends on quickly, so you can get it on squirming little bodies as quickly as possible.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sunscreen.  Great for kids and moms.  Love the spray bottle and it doesn&#x27;t make your child look like casper the ghost when applying it.  This is my go to sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Love the Alba products</li>
    <li> My daughter seems red after in the sun and using this.  I prefer aveeno kids sunscreen.  Maybe I&#x27;m not applying enough I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve mainly used this on myself. I don&#x27;t burn easily, so I can&#x27;t really say how much it works. But, I like the smell and the silky feel. I was just happy to find a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of harmful ingredients and chemicals. When I remember to put sunscreen on my sons (who are also dark), I use this now.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but it&#x27;s organic and so they charge us the mandatory premium.  Spray pump works well, no chemical smell when I apply it.  It sprays on like a more liquidy version of regular white suntan lotion. They&#x27;ve priced it so that many people won&#x27;t give it a try.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great! It sprays on and spreads easily without being greasy. The sunscreen works so well on the kids that we have been using it as well.</li>
    <li> Great product, blends easily and smells good. Like that you can spray then rub it in. Put it on all the kids, no burns.</li>
    <li> BEST kids sunscreen ever. Its thin enough that it spreads easily and quickly before babe squirms away and I love that its a spray without being an aerosal. Its clean and easy to use. Its not greasy or sticky and performs great.  I will be purchasing this every time we need more....never again going back to Neutragena or the other baby/kid brands that are so thick and slimy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself and 10 month old son So we could go hiking and not get burnt.  3500 feet up I had a bad allergic reaction, red itchy burning skin all over my arms face and neck.  My son broke out on his face.  Had to get benedryl to calm everything down.  I never have allergic reactions to anything and I&#x27;ve purchased many of your products before but I am very disappointed in this one here.  WONT EVER PURCHASE  AGAIN</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use it but pricey</li>
    <li> Easy application, doesn&#x27;t burn eyes, and doesn&#x27;t smell like a pina colada.  A winner in my book!  We have it on subscribe&amp;save during the summer months.</li>
    <li> I got burnt. My son got burnt. Despite applying and reapplying. Not happy with this product. Haven&#x27;t been sun burnt in 30 years. This was my son&#x27;s very first sunburn. I&#x27;m really mad.</li>
    <li> This is not actually a spray, it&#x27;s really more that it squirts out the lotion, but it&#x27;s still easier to apply than from a regular squeeze tube.</li>
    <li> Great kids sunscreen that goes in like a light lotion. This is one of my favorites. Good price too compared to some other healthier ingredient sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Used it over the weekend. It doesnt spray out, but rather squirts into your hand a small amont of lotion/sunscreen. I was under the impression that it would spray on the skin, but it squirts out into a lotion that you rub onto the body. I like it even thou I was wanting a spray. I would buy this again, as I only had to apply it once to my kids and they were out in the sun for several hours withou getting burnt!</li>
    <li> Amazon has added the words &amp;#34;Natural Protection&amp;#34; to the name of this product, which is nowhere to be found on the actual product. I wasn&#x27;t looking closely enough and was duped - the active ingredients include 5 different chemicals. As a few other people have mentioned, the Environmental Working Group considers this sunscreen to be a moderate hazard. EWG says that the first chemical ingredient, homosalate, is broken down by sunlight into harmful byproducts. Probably not the best choice for a sunscreen ingredient! I wish I had paid more attention before ordering this.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that first, this is safe to use on my kids.  I don&#x27;t want to have to worry about dangerous toxins leaching into them.  The spray isn&#x27;t like a mist, you still do have to rub it in, but it&#x27;s a lot smoother than a lot of the natural sunscreens i&#x27;ve used so you don&#x27;t have to worry about blotchy missed spots.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is the price for such a tiny bottle!</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly and works with my  son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  It is, unfortunately, VERY small for the price paid.</li>
    <li> No fragrance!  Great for the kids.  Rubs on smoothly (compared to Banana Boat for kids--if you want to look like a clown or you painted yourself white try the Banana Boat).  Alba Botanica is great!</li>
    <li> Make sure you reapply as it says after 80 min or you will start to burn. We were in the pool for 2 hrs and my kids started to get rosey. Goes on well. Wish the bottle was larger.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the only one I carry now for the whole family! The bottle is a good size for carrying around not to small &amp; not too big. It has a trigger spray which keeps my hands clean &amp; no messy caps! It also has a lock for the trigger so it doesn&#x27;t spray in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is a quality sunscreen. It absorbs easily, is easily applied, not greasy &amp; has great coverage! I LOVE this product!!</li>
    <li> love this sunscreen. it sprays on very well and love that its 40 spf. would recommend to a friend or family member.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to rub in!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this sunscreen from Amazon but thought it pertinent to write a review anyways. I don&#x27;t feel like this sunscreen works on my children at all. I have applied it at 4pm and had my kids out for an hour and they came in red. Note that this was late afternoon sun. The only reason I even gave it two stars is because the application is easy and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great and the spray bottle is KEY. I love that it&#x27;s not aerosol, but being able to squirt sunscreen on a busy two year old and quickly rub in is the way to go. We order it on subscribe and save in the summer, as it&#x27;s a must have in our family!</li>
    <li> Pro: It smelled great, didn&#x27;t feel or leave a greasy look and was fairly easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The only thing is that when you spray, you still have to rub---because it comes out in a white splatter. But once you rub it into your skin, no white streaks or residue is left behind.</li>
    <li> Out of all of the mineral-based / chemical free sunblocks we have tried, this is the best one because it rubs in easily. It protects even in the pool. I reapply whenever my daughter gets out of the pool and then every 2 hours just to be safe. It&#x27;s not the kind of spray you spray directly on, it&#x27;s not an aerosol, I spray it in my hand (it&#x27;s a white liquid) and then rub it on. It spreads easily and rubs in well. So far we&#x27;ve used it at least 5 days a week for the last two months and we still have around half a bottle left, so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Favorite sunscreen!! I was a preschool teacher for 5 years, and I have put on EVERY type of sunscreen on SO many children!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS ONE IS THE BEST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and easy to rub in&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are wholesome and feel good&lt;br /&gt;From a company I trust&lt;br /&gt;Smells Great&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves the spray kind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!  Goes on smooth without having sunblock look/film. The spray bottle is convenient &amp; it actually moisturizers skin well.</li>
    <li> I can not get the bottle to spray. Have read other user comments but the nozzle won&#x27;t move even when I removed it from the bottle.</li>
    <li> Works well and tear free!</li>
    <li> best sunscreen for kids!!!</li>
    <li> truly very emollient, a little goes a long way, I like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> My family loves this sunscreen, The spray works great and protects my children from getting sunburned, even when they are swimming for hours at time. I also like that there is a lock on the spray handle, so my little ones can&#x27;t spray it everywhere when I&#x27;m not looking. We&#x27;ve tried other natural/organic sunscreens (Honest Company) which still allowed my sons, who are extremely fair skinned,  to burn. I am really satisfied, and will continue to use Alba Botanica Natural Protection Kids Sunscreen. I highly recommend! ******UPDATE****** My family has been using this sunscreen for over 2 years now. We live in southern Alabama near the coast. We&#x27;ve added it to our subscribe &amp; save so we get it for just over $7. It&#x27;s still 5 stars. My husband and 3 sons are very fair skinned, and also have sensitive skin. This sunscreen has never let us down. This is a spray lotion, not am aerosol spray with harmful chemicals that&#x27;s bad for the environment, or more importantly bad for your family to ingest. It sprays on easily and I rub it in. I seriously don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews. This is still the best, most affordable natural and chemical free sunscreen!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and I saw that this product had good reviews and that it was easy to apply.  I was okay with the squirt rather than the aerosol spray because natural sunscreens are usually so difficult to apply.  My daughter had a huge reaction. I actually thought she had developed an allergy to the sun because she developed a rash that resembled a scarlet fever rash the two times we used this product and we were in the sun. I took her to the pediatric dermatologist and when she reviewed the list of ingredients she told me that sunscreens like this can actually bring on a rash. My daughter was miserable and itchy for days!  I do not recommend this product for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen for my young child. It works well, does not have too strong a smell, and this &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; bottle makes it very easy to apply. I put &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; in quotes because this is not an aerosol, and that is a good thing. Aerosols are not allowed at my child&#x27;s school, and I wouldn&#x27;t use them anyway. This kind of container is much easier to use than a squeeze-tube. The sunscreen sinks into the skin fairly quickly without looking white for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had been using Banana boat, and Neutrogena sunscreen and sunblock products for years and wanted something that was more safe for my skin.  I had done a lot of research and what I was reading was that sunscreens have these harmful/ un-natural chemicals in them.  The risks for not using sunscreen definitely do not out weight the risk for using it so I looked into some more natural options and found Alba Botanical.&lt;br /&gt;  It goes on a little greasier than I am use to, but it really is not that bad.  The smell is not as pungent as regular sunscreens.  It lasts just as long too!  Make sure to follow instructions in when and how long to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was very confusing in how to figure out how the lotion sprays out, but I figured it out.  It comes with this green looking clip that does not detach.  You have to move it almost all the way to the right you will be able to spray it.  I feel like the design of the clip on the spray bottle is the only bad thing about this product.</li>
    <li> First found it at Whole Foods.  Easy to go on.  It isn&#x27;t too thick.  Makes putting on sunscreen quick and easy.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old put this on as the directions said, but ended up with a nasty sunburn. Hard to know if it&#x27;s the sunscreen or user error - we didn&#x27;t bother trying it again to find out.</li>
    <li> Seems like a standard, run of the mill sunscreen. I thought the spray would make it more pleasant to apply but honestly, I end up just spraying it into my hand to rub onto my baby so there&#x27;s still the greasy feel. If anything, it makes me wish I&#x27;d just gotten the regular kind. No sunburns though and smells nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult and I use it.  No sunburns yet!</li>
    <li> Both of my kids have sensitive skin when it comes to sunscreen but so far they have not had any adverse reactions with this one. The consistancy of this sunscreen is light and it is very easy to rub into the skin unlike the other two Alba sunscreens we have tried (the Very Emollient sunblocks in the tube). The spray nozzle is not all that great so you can&#x27;t actually &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; it directly onto your body without making a drippy mess everywhere but it is easy to rub on if you spray it into your hands first. Out of all the sunscreens we have tried (and there have been many) we like this one the best.</li>
    <li> Would defiantly recommend this to all those parents who want to protect they child from the sun harsh exposures. This product does what it says and it is that simple!</li>
    <li> I bought it because I&#x27;m sensitive to sunscreens, but although it&#x27;s promoted as \\&quot;tear free\\&quot; it stings my eyes miserably.  For a sunscreen that truly doesn&#x27;t burn sensitive eyes, recommended to me by a friend who has a similar problem, try California Baby.  More expensive but high quality and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Best sunblock ever.  WE love this for our kids.  Very water resistant and isn&#x27;t chocked full of chemicals like most other sunblocks these days.</li>
    <li> Not as good as banana boat or other well known products.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a safe alterniative to normal sunscreens. but after looking more into this sunscreen also contains many harmful chemicals and is not rated well on ewg. I would not reccomend.</li>
    <li> Hands down our favorite sunscreen.  Easy to use and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting the product when I spray it.</li>
    <li> I really like that this is a natural sunscreen, with a spray function, that does not use aerosol. Unfortunately, if you use it on your face, it stings your eyes once you get in the water.  Not good for kids.</li>
    <li> It was so easy to apply &amp; it was a very good choice.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen and natural. Easy to apply with spray nozzle and absorbs into skin easily without any mess</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, but beware it will burn your eyes.  A perfectly good pool day was ruined with an hour and a half crying by my toddler after he inadvertently rubbed some in his eyes. It was an experience I wouldn&#x27;t wish on my worst enemy. Avoid applying on face but even applying on arms can make it&#x27;s way into eyes.</li>
    <li> Took a while to figure out how to &#x27;unlock&#x27; the bottle. But the spray mechanism and the lotion itself are great. This is my new default sunspray - wrks just as well for the whole family so I don&#x27;t need to get more than one bottle for everyone!</li>
    <li> I returned it.  Its got some ingredients that are not good for you!</li>
    <li> I LOVE using this on my son and nephew. My nephew has sensitive skin and breaks out in hives from most sunscreens. This sunscreen is so easy to apply to both babies (both under 1 when I started using it) and it works really well. It rubs in really easily and smells nice too!</li>
    <li> Bought this before I read the bad rating on EWG website. Prevents sunburn but leaves skin greasy and when using on your face, leaves bad taste in your mouth...not very natural or safe</li>
    <li> Nice scent. Goes on smoothly without leaving a white residue. The EWG website gives it a 4 so it&#x27;s a decent sunscreen.... and while not the most natural out there it&#x27;s definitely better than others. I also use it on my kids and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. No sunburns so far!</li>
    <li> Nice product. Goes on quite smoothly. Pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite go-to sunscreen. Trying to get sunscreen on at 14 month old is next to impossible. This spray rubs in easily and is a good size to throw in the beach bag to take with you everywhere. For the summer, I just keep it in my diaper bag.</li>
    <li> By far the best sunscreen we have found yet! My  2 year old son has very sensitive skin and this sunscreen works great! By far the easiest to apply as it sprays on and is so silky it absorbs into the skin with little effort.  Also has a great light scent.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, not sticky, works and doesn&#x27;t burn eyes!</li>
    <li> This is easy to spray &amp; easy to spread.  Fairly nice smell too.  I love it for my one daughter.  However for my other daughter who is allergic to most sunscreens, this is still a no-go.  I was hoping it would work with all the description, but she developed a rash with this one too.</li>
    <li> my little girl has an allergy to sunscreen (maybe the zinc?). this is the only sunscreen i have used on her that does not cause a rash! love it!</li>
    <li> kids love it and it&#x27;s not too sticky. It&#x27;s great that it has the natural ingredients we want.</li>
    <li> Finally I found a kid sunscreen that I can feel good about... no bad chemicals, good UVA+UVB coverage, easy to apply to a kid who hates sunscreen, goes on clear (not pasty white), and soaks in quickly without stickiness.  Thank you Alba!</li>
    <li> Like the spray and liquid is smooth and easy to apply.  However, it does sting your eyes (mine as well as the kids)... So not great for your face.</li>
    <li> When I first received it, I was shocked at how small it was. It was a tiny bottle and I felt a bit cheated. Then I tried it. Emollient it is (had to look that word up)! A little went a loooong way and I didn&#x27;t have to deal with rubbing the sunscreen in and leaving my kids with white marks all over their face and bodies. It went on so smoothly and easily. I honestly hate putting lotion and sunscreen on. The gooey feeling of the lotions and then having to wipe off the greasy sunscreen off. Yuck! This has solved all of that and knowing that it&#x27;s all natural makes it even better. Love this sunscreen and will be a user for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Best kids sunscreen out there. Spreads much easier than others and organic !</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen, natural, nice smelling.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and has a pleasant scent (not the usual overwhelming scent of sunscreen). It was a little greasy after applying, but nothing too bad. Definitely better than most lotions that are near impossible to rub in and leave a tacky, greasy feeling for hours after. I got one for myself and one for my best friend and we both love it for our LO&#x27;s!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this sunscreen a month or so ago, and I have been so happy with it! I have two kids under 3 that I bought this for, and neither of them have gotten even a tiny bit pink with it on, and we live in Colorado where burning is so much easier and quicker! The product is awesome, I love knowing I&#x27;m not covering their bodies with a ton of unnecessary chemicals. It&#x27;s also super easy application, and it soaks in almost immediately! So happy with this! I&#x27;m also very happy with the seller, there was a mistake with my order, and they were very quick to respond and fix it. I would definitely purchase from them again!</li>
    <li> Works great for both of my kids and the spray is convenient; unfortunately, the smell is pretty unpleasant. I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> My kids got sunburn after applying this several times a day at the pool... NOT GOOD!</li>
    <li> Alot smaller than I anticipated but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply, works very well!</li>
    <li> no sunburns and my little one likes to help apply it.&lt;br /&gt;last a few hours ( I do reapply after swimming though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenient bottle that can be locked so that it doesn&#x27;t spray all over the inside of your diaper bag.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a spray it&#x27;s mor like squirting the lotion</li>
    <li> Nozzle was broken on arrival. Otherwise great!</li>
    <li> I love Alba Botanica products and this spray is easy to apply.  Not as thick as their other sun screen.</li>
    <li> I use this on hands, neck and face almost daily.  Can make my face break out a tiny bit sometimes if I leave it on all day, but if I wash my face when I get home, nor probs.  I keep one in my car and use it when I start to drive.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is good for not containing some of the awful chemicals we all should avoid putting on our kids and ourselves. This is much more convenient than the alba lotion in the tubes which can be very thick and hard to rub in. This is quick and easy to rub in. It&#x27;s a very milky formula which is good for kids who hate getting sunscreen put on!&lt;br /&gt;In a 95 degree day from 11:30-4:30 my kids played in the sun and in and out of sprinklers. I did reapply this 1/2 way through the day and they are burn free. They did get some color but no burns and my kids are super fair skinned! So I&#x27;m happy with it. My one negative is the price for the size. This is only 4 oz. and for $10 thats a bit high as we&#x27;ll grow through this pretty quick. But I would still repurchase.</li>
    <li> Fantastic sunscreen! Very water resistant, absorbs quickly, non-sticky. You do have to rub it in, but the spray is really handy for good dispersion.</li>
    <li> Easy to spray and easy to rub into skin. Did not irritate my son&#x27;s sensitive skin at all - great sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Spreads very easily! Love it! Not really a thin spray, but also not as thick as normal sunscreen. Really, really love it, especially since I know it&#x27;s safe for my baby!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a spray sunscreen. It just pools out just as if I were squeezing a tube. More importantly, this sunscreen made my sons eye swell. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I choose this because I wanted to avoid chemicals on my babies skin. It smells great and works even better.</li>
    <li> I love the spray even more than I thought I would - it&#x27;s a lot faster and easier to simply spray sunscreen on your hands and apply, rather than turning a bottle upside down, shaking it, and trying to squeeze it out.  My kids like that it doesn&#x27;t have a funky smell and goes on very smoothly - you rub once and it&#x27;s on, with no leftover white residue.  Have tanned nicely and have had no sunburns with this on.</li>
    <li> I bought both the Alba Botanical Kids tube and spray to use on my granddaughter for a recent two week trip to Las Vegas and Hawaii. We went to the pool daily. The product in the bottle was smooth. The trigger for the spray worked easily and the product went on easily. We used it primarily for her face using other products for the rest of her. There was never a single complaint from her about any stinging in her eyes and she had no sun burn.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old boy has extremely sensitive skin and usually gets hives after wearing sunblock. That is not the case with this sunblock, he can wear it all day with out getting a rash. I love that it is a spray without being an aerosol can. I also really like that it is &#x27;tear free&#x27;. I like this sunscreen so much that I stopped using my Aveeno block and only use the Alba Spray...now I only have to by one type for the whole family. This particular formula goes on like a thin/runny lotion, but once it is rubbed I forget I am wear sunblock. If you are trying to avoid the typical greasy and sticky sunblock then give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Use it on my 4yr old all the time and no sun burn.  Very to easy use &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; but without the chemicals of a real spray on lotion.  Easy to rub in.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful spray sunscreen for kids. I love the fact that it is a pump spray. It does need to be rubbed in but I don&#x27;t mind because I feel like the fine mist spray sunscreens are dangerous...especially for kids. It has a nice, light fragrance. Some titanium sunscreens can tend to smell like metal, but this one doesn&#x27;t. It has a convenient lock for the spay mechanism so that it doesn&#x27;t inadvertently spray all over the inside of your bag. It offers excellent protection against UV. We live in south Florida, so sunscreen is a must. My son sweats a great deal and I find this product hold up very well.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately my 17 month old gets burnt with this sunscreen on and screams in pain when it gets in her eyes unlike the other sunscreens we&#x27;ve used. ThinkSport and ThinkBaby have worked way better without any issues.</li>
    <li> This is amazing, smells great and easy to apply.  My daughter loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have liked every product I have ordered by Alba.</li>
    <li> Spray aparatus broke on 2nd spray, so now ithas to be applied by hand.</li>
    <li> I love this product, although when it arrived the sprayer was broken. I was able to fix it so that I can use the lotion but I am unable to lock it so that it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It rubs in easily and we&#x27;ve never had a burn. The spray makes putting it on easy but doesn&#x27;t get in the air like aerosols.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen.  Goes on very easy, and the pump is handy because you always know how much is coming out.  Definitely not a spray, though.  More for pumping into your hand and rubbing in.  But, much better than in past years, especially for a safer product than the ones that have all kinds of bad chemicals in them.</li>
    <li> As a person with very fair skin (and a balding head....), this stuff works like a dream.  I&#x27;m not a kid (by far...), but that doesn&#x27;t matter with this product.  Bravo!</li>
    <li> This is the fourth natural sunscreen I have tried, and it&#x27;s the last. Truly the easiest to apply ever!!! It is not really a fine mist spray like you might think, it comes out like a lotion, but absorbs fast and easy. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I found the sunscreen to be very easy to apply - it isn&#x27;t thick and sticky.  I spray it in to my hands first and then apply it.  It is not like the misting spray sunscreen that the &amp;#34;commercial&amp;#34; brands are.  The smell is pleasant and no overpowering.  Best of all - it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
    <li> I love the feel and scent. Bought this for the kids and used it for myself. I even used it on my face and it didn&#x27;t sting my eyes, nor did the scent bother me.</li>
    <li> My sunscreen was spilled all in the bag and I needed it on the 26th for a trip. It wouldn&#x27;t let me add a pic</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to offer much protection from the sun.  We applied it all over, waited 30 minutes.  We were burnt in less than an hour out in the sun.  I didn&#x27;t even get wet.</li>
    <li> Love it! sprays nice, rubs in well and smells good.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to kids sunscreen. It works well....lasting and effective w/out loads of all the unnecessary chemicals/bad stuff you find in less expensive sunscreens. Your kids are worth the extra $.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen because it was Organic but I didn&#x27;t look at the ingredient list and when I received it I really didn&#x27;t like the ingredient list which is super long and with lots of not so good stuff. When I apply it on my skin I get an itchy/burning feeling for a few seconds. My 2 year old daughter also complained that it was painful when I applied it on her skin. I am not sure I will use up the bottle -- it might go to my husband or to the trash! (I really like the spraying system which is convenient though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: neither my daughter or myself are allergic to anything. I have posted the ingredient list on the customers photo section)&lt;br /&gt;This product gets a note 4 on EWG which isn&#x27;t very good:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> This product is junk.  The spray just spits gobs of sunscreen - defeats the purpose of having a spray.  It also has a faint stale odor that is unpleasant.  A big thumbs down from both my 10 year old and my 7 year old.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this sunscreen without the added chemicals! Goes on smooth and easy. Smells wonderful and lasts a long time. Reapply as you feel necessary. Can use for adults and kids alike. We have NEVER gotten burned using this product and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> The BEST in sunscreen for kids or adults! My twin toddlers were out in the sun all day during our week long vacation to Maui and no sunburns! it&#x27;s very pleasant unlike all the other brands that I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I am torn on this spray. We have always used the regular (non-spray) version of this and when I saw this version I wanted to try it. First, it just sprays a glop of thinned sunscreen on your skin. You have to rub it in just like the regular stuff. Second, sometimes the nozzle must be clogged because it will not only spray on your skin, but everywhere around you, too. I typically hold the nozzle about four inches from the skin so that all of the spray lands on the skin and not on the floor. So while the spray is &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; (my kids love it!) it&#x27;s not any more helpful than using the regular stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work just as well as the regular stuff, which I appreciated with a daughter with easy to burn skin! We have always used this brand sunscreen on her and it works great.</li>
    <li> This goes on easy because of the spray bottle. It&#x27;s easy to rub in, and doesn&#x27;t leave you coated in white. It works, no burns.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that does not burn my face or eyes.</li>
    <li> much easier that a stick. my son prefers it to the wet baby spray and it doesn&#x27;t have any to the chemicals we try to avoid. the whole family uses it</li>
    <li> Works good, gentle on skin and eyes and has a nice enough smell. I was going to get this again now but back when I got this initially it was cheaper for the pack of 2 than it is now, so ended up getting something else.</li>
    <li> So easy to apply, smells fine, protects my baby&#x27;s skin.  Wouldn&#x27;t want to use anything else.  I ordered a few other natural sunscreens and this was by far the best.  I use it on myself too and will be ordering more for next summer.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to aerosol sprays! Natural sunscreens can be thick (including other albas) making application tricky.  The spray is thinner and applies easily with sprayer! No sunburns on this spring break!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adult formula was just as great. $10 was a bit high for this many ounces, yet would purchase again!</li>
</ol>
