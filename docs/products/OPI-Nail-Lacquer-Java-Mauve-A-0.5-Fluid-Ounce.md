      <li>--OPI does make a great nail lacquer.</li>
      <li>This is a good nail lacquer, but I&#x27;m not so happy with the color.  </li>
      <li>Good quality polish.</li>
      <li>This color is absolutely gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Love it, great color.</li>
      <li>Its a very beautiful color goes on opaque but still gives nails a certain &#x27;pop&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I used it more than 20 years ago when I did my own nails.  </li>
      <li>I love the Java Mauve-a colour,  I consider it a neutral colour.  </li>
      <li>It was more orange-ish than the muted tan/mauve color I had before.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Was so glad I could find the color I needed.</li>
      <li>Love this color.</li>
      <li>I first bought O.P.I. at the salon and have loved it since.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m comfortable with it</li>
      <li>OPI is a fantastic polish.  </li>
      <li>goes on smoothly- dries</li>
      <li>For full opacity, two coats would do.</li>
      <li>quick-</li>
      <li>It really stays and does not chip easily.  </li>
      <li>Like all OPI Nail Polishes, it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t chip quickly.</li>
      <li>I really like this nail polish!</li>
      <li>I have been an OPI fan pretty much my whole life.</li>
      <li>Budget friendly, recommend- making it more likly to buy same product in several spring colors-</li>
      <li>I wear this most of the time for more of a professional look when I want a little flare over the natural look.</li>
      <li>One coat is not too sheer but gives the nail a light wash of color.</li>
      <li>This polish is more in the pink family than the browns.</li>
      <li>Stay on longer than other more pricy  </li>
      <li>Although there seemed to be a problem with me getting it, I think they are a decent company to use.</li>
      <li>With a name like Java Mauve I was expecting a little more Java than Mauve.  </li>
      <li>It is well worth the extra cost.</li>
      <li>Super pretty color, especially if you like a muted pink and prefer matte over sparkle or glitter, like I do.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really the only color I ever care to use.  </li>
      <li>Thought this polish would be better as it is Opi - seems a little too thin going on, and chipped too easily.</li>
      <li>Pretty everyday color.</li>
      <li>I usually go for deep reds and dark purples but decided to try this for a more conservative environment.</li>

<li> Purchased this product along with some other stuff.</li>
<li> The OPI Java mauve color is little darker than what it was shown in the picture</li>
<li> At least let me know</li>
<li> It looks pretty terrible on my toes, but for someone who likes colors with a brownish cast, this will please them.  </li>
<li> Sorry it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>

    <li> Was so glad I could find the color I needed. Shopped all over and no one had it.  Hate it when a good polish comes along and then stores stop selling it. Thank GOD for Amazon. Jean</li>
    <li> Purchased this product along with some other stuff. I noticed it took long for my nail polish to come but overall, when I contacted them about my concern, I got it about 5 days later. Although there seemed to be a problem with me getting it, I think they are a decent company to use.</li>
    <li> With a name like Java Mauve I was expecting a little more Java than Mauve.  This polish is more in the pink family than the browns.</li>
    <li> I first bought O.P.I. at the salon and have loved it since. Beautiful finish and shades. It is well worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> I have been an OPI fan pretty much my whole life. This color is absolutely gorgeous. I wear this most of the time for more of a professional look when I want a little flare over the natural look.</li>

    <li> Love it, great color.</li>
    <li> Was not the color stated, but a decent color none the less. It was more orange-ish than the muted tan/mauve color I had before.</li>
    <li> I really like this nail polish! Arrived promptly and looks great!!</li>
    <li> Love this color. Sorry it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed. I usually go for deep reds and dark purples but decided to try this for a more conservative environment. Its a very beautiful color goes on opaque but still gives nails a certain &#x27;pop&#x27;. Bonus, also received shipping two days after ordering.</li>
    <li> Pretty everyday color. Good quality polish. Arrived on time!</li>
    <li> The OPI Java mauve color is little darker than what it was shown in the picture but I like it.</li>
    <li> This is a good nail lacquer, but I&#x27;m not so happy with the color.  It looks pretty terrible on my toes, but for someone who likes colors with a brownish cast, this will please them.  It&#x27;s just a personal preference about the color, so I&#x27;m giving it a four star rating anyway--OPI does make a great nail lacquer.</li>
    <li> Thought this polish would be better as it is Opi - seems a little too thin going on, and chipped too easily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that they discontinued this color.</li>
    <li> I love the Java Mauve-a colour,  I consider it a neutral colour.  The formula is ok, not too thin or thick.  It&#x27;s opaque in 2 coats and I had no problems with chipping or bubbling.</li>
    <li> goes on smoothly- dries quick- Stay on longer than other more pricy  Lacquers-&lt;br /&gt;Looks great on- Budget friendly, recommend- making it more likly to buy same product in several spring colors-</li>
    <li> OPI is a fantastic polish.  It really stays and does not chip easily.  This color is perfect.  If you are looking for a pink that is not a bubble gum pink this is for you.</li>
    <li> My mom has been looking for this color for months and when I found it, I just had to get it for her. The color is so beautiful. One coat is not too sheer but gives the nail a light wash of color. For full opacity, two coats would do. Like all OPI Nail Polishes, it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t chip quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used this color for as long as they have had it.  I used it more than 20 years ago when I did my own nails.  I couldn&#x27;t find it where I get my nails done now and my daughter found it on Amazon!  It&#x27;s really the only color I ever care to use.  I love it, I&#x27;m comfortable with it and I beg O.P.I. to NEVER EVER stop making it.  At least let me know so I can buy up a bunch of it to last me forever!</li>
