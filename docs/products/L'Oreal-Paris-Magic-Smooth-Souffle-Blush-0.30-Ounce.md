      <li>Best blush ever!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really impressed with the staying power.</li>
      <li>Makes the skin look flawless!  </li>
      <li>Perfect blush and an unbelieveable price.</li>
      <li>This is the best blush I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Looks great.</li>
      <li>Its everything I wanted it to be with great color and goes on evenly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy that Amazon is selling it</li>
      <li>This is a great blush.  </li>
      <li>This is NOT the fault of the seller who delivered on time and in good packaging.  </li>
      <li>I have a fair complexion</li>

      <li>Lovely!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>Goes on so smooth!!  </li>
      <li>It was great because it went on smoothly using your fingertips and did not highlight any aspects of aging skin</li>
      <li>Goes on well, blends nicely.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if they had some stronger colors I could use on my cheeks as blush.</li>
      <li>It is no longer available in stores so this is great to be able to purchase it online.</li>
      <li>but sometimes it&#x27;s nice to just be able to use a product and have it work well on its own.</li>
      <li>The only issue I&#x27;ve come across is that sometimes when you apply it with your fingers the product can get a bit crumbly in places (mousse foundations have this problem sometimes too), but if you use a brush to apply it it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous and the finish and staying power is great on its own.</li>
      <li>Very light.</li>
      <li>Fine lines kind of vanished and my complexion looked smother and even.</li>
      <li>, it glides on so smoothly and is a nice shade.</li>

      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Blends in so easily with fingertips or brush.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It is not flashy and goes on very easy.</li>
      <li>The texture is so smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>The plum color works well with my light skin.</li>
      <li>When no longer available, I don&#x27;t know what I will use to replace it.  </li>

      <li>Smooth and soft</li>
      <li>I would have returned it, but I packed it for vacation without opening it first.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had a ton of luck with the lasting power of these type of cream/mousse blushes unless you use a setting powder over top.</li>
      <li>Great color but old and dried up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;spongie&amp;#34; like it is old or kept in storage too long, but it works fine and very worth what I paid.  </li>
      <li>The plum/mauve blends beautifully with my skin to give a soft subtle glow.  </li>
      <li>I had a hard time finding it in the store but was delighted to find it online.</li>

      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I really like this.  </li>
      <li>I really like this</li>
      <li>Not sure how it will hold up in heat/humidity though will have to wait and see when it gets warm again.</li>
      <li>I guess I will just have to hope that somehow Loreal will bring back this soft and fabulous blush.</li>
      <li>and it all was kind of dried but still soft.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My mom has been using this product forever and has tried several different ones and always buys this when its available.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to buy it on Amazon since it is very hard to find right now.</li>
      <li>It looks so professional.  </li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It feels like velvet on your skin and looks totally natural.  </li>
      <li>seemed like it was old.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy, applies easily and gives a nice even, natural rosy base color to my face.  </li>
      <li>I have a light olive complexion and can usually wear any color of blush or lipstick, but the Plume color barely showed??</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale.  </li>

    <li> Unfortunately, I believe that L&#x27;Oreal has now discontinued this product.  It was one of the few creme blushes that I could find.  It was great because it went on smoothly using your fingertips and did not highlight any aspects of aging skin like the powder blushes tend to do.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it every day but I like the product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a ton of luck with the lasting power of these type of cream/mousse blushes unless you use a setting powder over top. I guess that&#x27;s not the end of the world, but sometimes it&#x27;s nice to just be able to use a product and have it work well on its own. Anyway, I decided to give these a try and I&#x27;m really impressed with the staying power. The only issue I&#x27;ve come across is that sometimes when you apply it with your fingers the product can get a bit crumbly in places (mousse foundations have this problem sometimes too), but if you use a brush to apply it it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous and the finish and staying power is great on its own.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple years.  The texture is so smooth and silky. I put it on my cheeks, eyelids, nose, forehead, and chin as a base for sculpting, then a light dusting of powder, blush, eye shadow, and mascara.  Lovely!</li>
    <li> I love this blush.  It is not flashy and goes on very easy.</li>

    <li> Such a great product. Works for me. I love it. Blends in so easily with fingertips or brush.</li>
    <li> Product was crumbly....guess why they no longer carry it at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> seemed like it was old.  Opened it and it all was kind of dried but still soft.  Wouldn&#x27;t reorder.  Very sad, I really liked this product when I got it in the store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s creamy, applies easily and gives a nice even, natural rosy base color to my face.  I&#x27;m pretty pale.  I have really sensitive skin and this has never given me a problem.  Great for dry or older skin.  It would be nice if they had some stronger colors I could use on my cheeks as blush.</li>
    <li> Very light. Easy to apply. Looks great. I hope what replaces it will be of the same quality. Great product!</li>
    <li> I  would  recommend  this  product to  everyone.  This  is  a  product  that  I  will  reorderi  later.  Five  stars  is  correct.  Marion</li>

    <li> Perfect blush and an unbelieveable price.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  Bought some in a store, but when time to buy again, it wasn&#x27;t there so ordered it online from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  I really like this, it glides on so smoothly and is a nice shade.</li>
    <li> My favorite blush.  It looks so professional.  Smooth and soft</li>
    <li> Product was dry and pulling away from the inside of the container.  I added a bit of oil to it to spread which seemed to work ok.  I have a light olive complexion and can usually wear any color of blush or lipstick, but the Plume color barely showed?? I am surprised by all the good reviews.  I will stick with bareminerals blush.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using this product forever and has tried several different ones and always buys this when its available. I was very excited to buy it on Amazon since it is very hard to find right now.</li>
