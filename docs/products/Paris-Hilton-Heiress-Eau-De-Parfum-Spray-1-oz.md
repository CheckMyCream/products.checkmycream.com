      <li>Top Notes:  Passion Fruit, Orange, Peach Granita, Champagne Mimosa  </li>
      <li>Love the perfume.</li>
      <li>but this fragrance makes it okay for colder weather as well.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume</li>
      <li>Love her perfume line.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>It is very nice, light and well worth the money</li>
      <li>I had a very pleasant experience and will definitely order this again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too sweet, and more sophisticated.</li>
      <li>and I was hit with the lovely sweet scent of maraschino cherries.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unique and I can&#x27;t think of any smell quite like this one, so</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light without being too overbearing though can get overbearing if too much is spritzed.</li>
      <li>THIS SPRAY IS SOFT AND SUTTLE, NOT TOO STRONG NOR OVER BEARING.  </li>
      <li>It was everything I expected plus more!</li>
      <li>I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.</li>
      <li>The scent is very light, pretty and feminine, and stayed with me for several hours.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this parfum spray, I felt underwhelmed.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have bought this parfum.</li>
      <li>and I was , at first, concerned that it might be flowery.</li>
      <li>It has at first a \\&quot;hint\\&quot; of something and then gone.  </li>
      <li>so i took that to mean it smells good.</li>
      <li>I received it very quickly and there were even samples of other perfume and cologne in my package.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere within convenience to where I live.</li>
      <li>SUCH AS PERFUME ON LINE IS DIFFICULT, I TOOK A CHANCE AND HAPPY</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like getting a piece of gum and after 1min the flavour if it had any at all is completely gone.</li>
      <li>The initial impression was that of a fresh, yet generic scent that didn&#x27;t stay with me.</li>
      <li>Grenadine is certainly the dominant scent here, with just enough of somethings else mixed in to soften it.</li>
      <li>This perfume is not overly musky, which can be irritating if too strong.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I read the reviews for this perfume, and due to the \\&quot;good\\&quot; reviews thought I would chance it.  I have not only drenched myself in this perfume, but drenched my daughter with it and... WHERE IS THE SCENT?  It has at first a \\&quot;hint\\&quot; of something and then gone.  It&#x27;s like getting a piece of gum and after 1min the flavour if it had any at all is completely gone. WOULD NOT BUY NOR TAKE A RISK ON THIS PERFUME!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Gave this to one of my granddaughters. She loved it. Great parfume.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is light without being too overbearing though can get overbearing if too much is spritzed. I am getting hints of honeysuckle and this is a nice scent to add to any perfume. Honeysuckle is a fragrance I would actually use in the summer but this fragrance makes it okay for colder weather as well. This perfume is not overly musky, which can be irritating if too strong. I am glad I got this and will make sure to try more of her fragrances!  What&#x27;s in this Fragrance?  Top Notes:  Passion Fruit, Orange, Peach Granita, Champagne Mimosa  Middle Notes:  Star Jasmine, Tiare Flower, Ylang-Ylang, Honeysuckle, Dewberry Blossom, Grenadine  Base Notes:  Violet Leaf, Vetiver, Tonka, Blonde Woods</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere within convenience to where I live. I received it very quickly and there were even samples of other perfume and cologne in my package. It was everything I expected plus more! I had a very pleasant experience and will definitely order this again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> i bought this for a friend and she described the scent as &amp;#34;Princessy&amp;#34;. so i took that to mean it smells good.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this parfum spray, I felt underwhelmed. The initial impression was that of a fresh, yet generic scent that didn&#x27;t stay with me. In fact, I soon forgot I was wearing it. The next time I used it, it started out that way, too... until it settled and I was hit with the lovely sweet scent of maraschino cherries. Grenadine is certainly the dominant scent here, with just enough of somethings else mixed in to soften it. The scent is very light, pretty and feminine, and stayed with me for several hours. It would be perfect for date night, but also appropriate for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came with a set &amp;#34;Paris Hilton Variety 5 Piece Mini Gift Set for Women&amp;#34; http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N8I10YG/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 and I plan on reviewing each scent individually as I try them out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it lasts as long. It could be that I&#x27;m used to the smell, but I don&#x27;t catch glimpses of this perfume throughout the day. Was expecting a better result. Love her perfume line.</li>
    <li> Years ago my sister got this perfume on her birthday and i totally used it all up. she was pissed. soo finally I&#x27;m going to buy her this perfume again for Christmas and it still smells amazing lol</li>
    <li> BUYING ITEMS SUCH AS PERFUME ON LINE IS DIFFICULT, I TOOK A CHANCE AND HAPPY I DID.  THIS SPRAY IS SOFT AND SUTTLE, NOT TOO STRONG NOR OVER BEARING.  I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.</li>
    <li> Love the perfume. It smells just like the store bought bottle I had a few years ago.</li>
    <li> I tried this perfume in the store and I fell in love with it. I&#x27;m going to assume this is one of those &amp;#34;it smells different on everyone&amp;#34; things, and it just doesn&#x27;t smell good on me &#x3D;( Too bad. I really liked this one.</li>
    <li> 100% positivo yconfiable</li>
    <li> Pedro Guerra Paliche, My daugheter is very  glad and happy with this gift, she love it, It is very beautiful.</li>
    <li> I like the scent. It&#x27;s not too sweet, and more sophisticated.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. I have been wearing it for years and I get so many compliments. I don&#x27;t like flowery scents and I was , at first, concerned that it might be flowery. It is not. Best fragrance ever and has not gone out of style.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have bought this parfum. It is very nice, light and well worth the money</li>
