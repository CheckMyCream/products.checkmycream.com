### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great color!</li>
      <li>wonderful color!</li>
      <li>and it works great!!!!</li>
      <li>Perfect neutral.</li>
      <li>I love the color of this nail polish!!!</li>
      <li>Very nice neutral color!</li>
      <li>Great Product.  </li>
      <li>but this color is very nice.</li>
      <li>One of the best OPI colors ever, so glad it&#x27;s available in gel.  </li>
      <li>a nice in-between.</li>
      <li>Was also shipped to me very quickly!</li>
      <li>I love the color</li>
      <li>LOVE the Color and the wear.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still in love.</li>
      <li>You will be able to get away with one layer if you do.</li>
      <li>Make sure you shake these bottles before use.  </li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>The color is more of a grayish-beige cream color.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion one of the top nail lacquers.&lt;br /&gt;And you&#x27;re not shelling out top dollar for it.</li>
      <li>I love the color and it came pretty quick too!!!</li>
      <li>does not work with my LED nor UV light.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite OPI nail color and the gelcolor is just as amazing as the regular polish!</li>
      <li>OPI went on super easy (without getting any on my skin!), and gave great coverage without looking clumpy/ thick!</li>
      <li>I think OPI gel is better than the gelish brand by far.</li>
      <li>This is the first opi gel I bought.usually use gelish.</li>
      <li>Exactly the color I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I have used Sensationail, Gelish, and Red Carpet Manicure, and although these products also gave me a salon quality manicure that lasts for atleast 10 days, I always ended up picking off polish from my skin when I was done and attributed this to my not so fantastic painting skills!</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this color as a regular nail polish.</li>
      <li>When I saw that they sold it as a shellac color I got VERY excited, bought it, used it last night</li>
      <li>Love the product, the color looks just a little different on the screen than on nails, same great OPI features.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it---great for any season!</li>
      <li>I used it very sparingly, nonetheless it dripped all over my cuticles and fingers after applying.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t know Jacques and Lincoln park after dark were VERY watery even after many coats.  </li>
      <li>(It&#x27;s also nice to have familiarity with colors being a long time user of OPI regular polish!)</li>
      <li>The color is spot on - exactly like the color in the regular polish line.</li>
      <li>I think my gel collection would be complete.</li>
      <li>This color will out last any gelish I have by weeks!!Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>Gel color is the exact same color as regular polish.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s more expensive (why I didn&#x27;t want to try it in the first place), the bottle is big (normal size of regular OPI polish) where as other brands are very tiny and also it&#x27;s worth it I believe!!</li>
      <li>This is another classic shade of brown in the long lasting GelColor.  </li>

<li> This is not a new color from OPI.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the OPI gel colors - they are thicker so they peel faster than other brands</li>
<li> The consistency of this polish was far too thin....</li>
<li> and I combine the gelish base and top coat with the opi gel color</li>
<li> Totally odd.</li>
<li> BUT it takes at least 6 coats to get it to a shade that&#x27;s not transluscent.</li>
<li> I just found the gel version to be vrey difficult to apply.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE the Color and the wear. I think OPI gel is better than the gelish brand by far. It seems to stay on my nails for a longer period of time. Was also shipped to me very quickly!</li>
    <li> Love the color. Lasts me two weeks.</li>
    <li> The picture shows that this is a shade of brown.  The color is more of a grayish-beige cream color.  Very nice neutral color!</li>
    <li> This is not a new color from OPI. The texture was a bit of a problem in the bottle I got. It seemed to &amp;#34;run&amp;#34; even though it did not appear watery, and my manicurist had rolled and shaken it well.</li>
    <li> I love the color and it came pretty quick too!!! I use Gelish gel polishes all the time and I combine the gelish base and top coat with the opi gel color and it works great!!!!</li>
    <li> does not work with my LED nor UV light.  Totally odd.</li>
    <li> I love the color BUT it takes at least 6 coats to get it to a shade that&#x27;s not transluscent.</li>
    <li> Love the product, the color looks just a little different on the screen than on nails, same great OPI features.</li>
    <li> Perfect neutral. Not gray, not brown...a nice in-between.</li>
    <li> One of the best OPI colors ever, so glad it&#x27;s available in gel.  Now if only they would bring back we&#x27;ll always have Paris and Tickle my France-y in the gel line I think my gel collection would be complete.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t heed the warnings.  you don&#x27;t know Jacques and Lincoln park after dark were VERY watery even after many coats.  they are not returnable.  keep you money!</li>
    <li> wonderful color! I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the OPI gel colors - they are thicker so they peel faster than other brands but this color is very nice.</li>
    <li> In my opinion one of the top nail lacquers.&lt;br /&gt;And you&#x27;re not shelling out top dollar for it.</li>

    <li> I fell in love with this color as a regular nail polish. When I saw that they sold it as a shellac color I got VERY excited, bought it, used it last night and I&#x27;m still in love.</li>
    <li> This is another classic shade of brown in the long lasting GelColor.  I used it with &amp;#34;Wooden Shoe Like to Know&amp;#34; for a two color manicure and got bunches of compliments.</li>
    <li> The consistency of this polish was far too thin....it bled all over my nails after one application. I used it very sparingly, nonetheless it dripped all over my cuticles and fingers after applying. The color is spot on - exactly like the color in the regular polish line. I just found the gel version to be vrey difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> polish is water-y. does not apply well.</li>
    <li> This is the first opi gel I bought.usually use gelish. This color will out last any gelish I have by weeks!!Shipped fast. Great color!</li>
    <li> I love the color of this nail polish!!! Exactly the color I was looking for. Highly recommend it---great for any season!</li>
    <li> I have used Sensationail, Gelish, and Red Carpet Manicure, and although these products also gave me a salon quality manicure that lasts for atleast 10 days, I always ended up picking off polish from my skin when I was done and attributed this to my not so fantastic painting skills! But, after using OPI, I realized it may not have been me!  OPI went on super easy (without getting any on my skin!), and gave great coverage without looking clumpy/ thick! I don&#x27;t if it&#x27;s the short brush or the quality of the gel, but whatever it is I am now hooked on OPI gel polish! Although it&#x27;s more expensive (why I didn&#x27;t want to try it in the first place), the bottle is big (normal size of regular OPI polish) where as other brands are very tiny and also it&#x27;s worth it I believe!! (It&#x27;s also nice to have familiarity with colors being a long time user of OPI regular polish!)</li>
