      <li>My hair does not feel silky smooth or is glossy after applying before hair blowing or when my hair is dry.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING in stores from cheap, to expensive and nothing works as well as this fine product right here.</li>
      <li>I use it every morning just on the last couple of inches of my hair and brushing my hair spreads it up a little to give a nice shine to my hair.  </li>
      <li>I seriously can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 months now, the first one i actually bought at the mall for $70.00</li>
      <li>i have thin fly away hair that is often dry...</li>

<li> I dye it using a natural Henna dye also purchased on Amazon, see my other reviews, and the oil turns the red into a deep auburn in places, the different shades of gray making the henna take different degrees or shades in my hair as well.  </li>
<li> Works as a great detangler initially when hair is wet but also seems to keep hair from tangling as bad when it is dry.  </li>

    <li> Everythink ok with amazon thank you</li>
    <li> I used the regular serum with just vit E but then, I saw this kind and buy it. And I have to conffes I like the regurar better, becouse this is litter oily but, I like both.!</li>

    <li> Love this product. Great for my granddaughters and my hair.</li>

    <li> This hair argan oil smells nice and makes my hair feel softer.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Smooths hair making it feel soft and smells great</li>
    <li> It was okay I just expected more out of it. It can make your hair more soft. You can give it a try</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, and I just thought that meant it was naturally frizzy.  I have tried other oils and leave in conditioners, but they weighed my hair down, made it not hold a curl from the curling iron, and made it feel dirty.  Not Herstyler Hair Serum.  My hair soaks it in like a wick!  I use it every morning just on the last couple of inches of my hair and brushing my hair spreads it up a little to give a nice shine to my hair.  I get compliments on it all the time now.  I can use it every day on my ends and still use a curling iron on it or rollers at night and use it in the morning and the curl does not fall out, my hair is actually bouncy.  It is amazing and I am so excited to have found it.  I would pay the high mall price, which is how I found it, got a bottle free with the purchase of a Herstyler straightener in my efforts to smooth out my frizzy ends.  I don&#x27;t use the hot iron on my hair, it just sits under my sink.  I like to use rollers at night if I take the time and then I just brush my hair out or finger brush the curls for a different look.  I squirt a drop on 3 fingertips, rub the other 3 fingers on the other hand over them to put the oil on both hands, then I take section of my hair, about 1/5th of my hair, in my hands and grab about 2-3 inches up from the ends and rub down several times, repeat the process with the next shank of hair until the tips are soft and shiny.  I open my fingers and run my hands through my hair from my face back a couple of times to add the shine up top, not adding any more oil, just using the oil on my hands left from doing the tips.  It has a lovely fragrance that I am complimented on as well.  My hair is rather coarse and I am severely going gray, so it is wiry.  I dye it using a natural Henna dye also purchased on Amazon, see my other reviews, and the oil turns the red into a deep auburn in places, the different shades of gray making the henna take different degrees or shades in my hair as well.  The two used have taken my old wiry hair and turned me into a whole new, younger looking woman, who is getting compliments on her hair that she has never gotten before!  To find it here, in a lot of 4 bottles was a great find.  I will use this FOREVER!  I do like the other products in this line, the shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner as well.  Very nice, light on my hair, doesn&#x27;t attract dirt as many other products have.have taken my old wiry hair and turned me into a whole new, younger looking woman, who is getting compliments on her hair that she has never gotten before!

Very nice, light on my hair, doesn&#x27;t attract dirt as many other products have.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was swindled to spend $50 in the mall for one bottle of this stuff. It lasted a long time and my hair is insanely healthy despite all the crap I put it through. When I started getting low, I bought this pack for a STEAL (compared to what I had spent at the kiosk) and gave bottles out to my friends to try. It smells AMAZING by the way. I want perfume in this scent!</li>
    <li> A beauty product that has fetched me compliments on my hair numerous times a week!</li>
    <li> Great deal, my package came on time. However my hair serums weren&#x27;t properly closed tight,  causing some of the product to spill out. I couldn&#x27;t return the package cause my hair seriously needed the serum.  Future advice for the seller: please close tight your products</li>
    <li> First let me say that this is an amazing product. It leaves my hair shiny and soft and smells sooooo good. I really love this brand! However, my rating is poor because my order arrived damaged. One of four bottles were broken and drenched everything leaving the box and its contents oily! I am upset as I&#x27;ve ordered before and did not have any issues. I would like a reimbursement or a replacement. Photos are attached for proof.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Love it. Love it. Love it. Makes hair feel like silk. Smells great. Perfect for hair of all types.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year now and my hair is smooth and silky soft.&lt;br /&gt;I use heat on my hair daily and there is no damage at all. My hair is growing&lt;br /&gt;stronger and longer and looks really healthy. I used to buy this product in a mall&lt;br /&gt;in Georgia for $35 a bottle. So I am very happy with the price on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have 4 bottles for less then the price I used to buy it for.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everybody who&#x27;s using heat on their hair frequently.</li>
    <li> Had a trial size I tried and had to have more!  Got a great price for a great product.  Works as a great detangler initially when hair is wet but also seems to keep hair from tangling as bad when it is dry.  Makes dry brushing much easier as well.  Also makes my hair much softer.  A person would think an oil would make hair oily and heavy but I find this doesn&#x27;t.  It makes my hair soft and manageable.  Have shared it with family and friends who share my same views on this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I only paid about 22 dollars for 4 bottles! I absolutely love this stuff! It smells soooo good an it leaves my hair shiny and soft. This was a good deal! I had to get it!</li>
    <li> i have thin fly away hair that is often dry...i use this on may hair every single day and have been doing so for the past 2 years and wow!....it has helped me grow my hair so long. Before this product my hair would just split and break off and i could not get it to grow...you only need to use a little on the ends and then a little on your palms and then run your fingers thru it, then brush it thru your hair. I will be using this product...forever!!! If u happen to put a little to much in  your hair dont worry..it will soak into ur hair by the next day or u can give it a quick blow dry.  This product leaves your hair silky soft and looking healthy day after day after day...amazing.</li>
    <li> I use it before I straighten or curl my hair. It smells really good.</li>
    <li> smells great but can get a little bit greasy. Bottle is made of glass and I accidentally dropped it and it shattered into so many pieces. Since it came in a 4 pack I gifted some to my sisters and my mom. So it&#x27;s a great gift idea</li>
    <li> Awesome for hair that appears dull and dry.  Great results.  It makes my hair so nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Love the oil</li>
    <li> I love how it smells and it does help with tangles</li>
    <li> It is really a great item for your hair</li>
    <li> Quick delivery,  work as stated .  I have no complain</li>
    <li> It is not as good as the other reviewers wrote. My hair does not feel silky smooth or is glossy after applying before hair blowing or when my hair is dry. Disappointed that the result is not as good as what others wrote.</li>
    <li> I buy over and over again.</li>
    <li> I first found this product when I was out of town for a football tournament for my son..I came home used it and fell in love with it!!! My hairstylist even commented on how the texture of my hair had improved..so when my supply was running low I was a little frantic on how I was gonna find this product again..so then I thought of Amazon!! I was so happy to find it and will continue to order it.. My hair hasn&#x27;t been in this good of shape in a long time!! Thank you Herstyler and Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Great product... I make sure to always have a bottle on hand.  Works great for when I straighten my hair or when I wear it wavy and don&#x27;t want any frizz.</li>
    <li> Being using for a while and it does what I want it to do on my wigs.  Love it a lot</li>
    <li> I seriously can&#x27;t live without this product. I am Black/ Mexican and my hair it&#x27;s too uncontrollable, curly but puffy and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING in stores from cheap, to expensive and nothing works as well as this fine product right here. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 months now, the first one i actually bought at the mall for $70.00 so i was stoked to find this product in a package of 4 for such a low price, and the same exact thing !</li>
    <li> Excellent product at an amazing price!!!!</li>
    <li> I like to much, thankyou !</li>
    <li> Awesome product, fast shipping A+++</li>
    <li> great product,we order all the time.</li>
