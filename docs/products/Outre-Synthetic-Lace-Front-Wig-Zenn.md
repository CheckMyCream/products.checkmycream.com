      <li>I think I&#x27;ll order her in another color honestly.</li>
      <li>The texture is nice.</li>
      <li>but I will say the older she gets the more she sheds!!!</li>
      <li>but this one was the best one I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
      <li>I love this front lace by far the best synthetic wig i ever perches.</li>
      <li>This shipper was FINE!</li>
      <li>and the wig is Amazing not to mention I decided to wear her during labor with that being said she holds up pretty good to be synthetic anyway</li>
      <li>It looks okay, but I can&#x27;t wear it</li>
      <li>and I love the way it looked.</li>
      <li>but overall it&#x27;s a great wig!</li>
      <li>Might look better on somebody else.</li>
      <li>Love love love zenn</li>
      <li>I straightened it and love the look.</li>
      <li>I love this wig, haven&#x27;t worn one in years</li>
      <li>But I wore it with cute hats</li>
      <li>I love them</li>
      <li>I Tried brushing her and just got frizzy then straightness it and the talks show even more</li>
      <li>I wore it for halloween and more women stopped me and asked where I got it from.</li>
      <li>love the color with the roots.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the way the top of the wig looks</li>
      <li>and she takes good to the hot water method as well</li>
      <li>Delivery was very quick.</li>
      <li>Again, this shipper I used was fine as well.</li>
      <li>FOR THE FIT.  </li>
      <li>But once again for the price it is a great piece especially for a lace front</li>
      <li>And I really enjoy my wig</li>
      <li>I bought Lydia first and liked it so much I ordered Zenn in DR613.</li>
      <li>I got the same color as the pic gorgeous color and&lt;br /&gt;Amazing</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as full as I wanted</li>
      <li>Also she tangles like REAL easy, more so than any other synthetic wig I&#x27;ve had.</li>
      <li>That really is a shame as it looks fine.</li>
      <li>esp if you have a large head (don&#x27;t even try!).</li>
      <li>Seller had fast shipping item as described color was amazing and would buy from again thank you this wig is great my only complaint is for the company that makes the wigs not this seller</li>
      <li>This wig REALLY cute, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>they are so pretty</li>
      <li>Everyone thought it was real!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had her twice shipping was pretty fast</li>
      <li>this is my main wig keep ordering more of them want to try the red one</li>
      <li>looks very realistic.</li>
      <li>Not really any complaints besides the top portion of the wig.</li>
      <li>so i can keep it and just have this straight one and a curly one</li>
      <li>i recommend unless you want it permanently straight  </li>
      <li>, it doesn&#x27;t blend well into my real hair.</li>
      <li>I got it in the lightest blonde with the dark roots but the roots are greasy looking and not the kind of greasy looking that you can fix.</li>
      <li>its a great wig for the price, however it is a very thin wig.</li>
      <li>u definitely will know the hair gets kind of stiff</li>
      <li>it is a great wig it has everything it says it is a little thin at first</li>
      <li>The wig is pretty long too.</li>
      <li>very tangled wish could of sent it back for my money</li>
      <li>/&gt;Worth the money by far</li>
      <li>You can see the tracks plain as day on the top and on the back of the wig.</li>
      <li>It was a very cute wig but it was too thin in the middle.</li>
      <li>i love the wig munis the fact that it every thin i looks alot fuller via the picture</li>

<li> It was a very cute wig but it was too thin in the middle.</li>
<li> i love the wig munis the fact that it every thin i looks alot fuller via the picture</li>
<li> Can u flat iron</li>
<li> but there&#x27;s little i can do to hide the back from showing completely.</li>
<li> but it could use a little more hair its a bit thin but its do-able.</li>
<li> My last gripe is the cap is really small and the hairline by the ears ends VERY far back on me</li>
<li> Very dramatic and quite stunning.</li>
<li> after that I kept her for like another 6 months not wearing her everyday of course when the wig is old</li>
<li> Like you can see tracks in the back if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
<li> But I put two of them together, because one is not full enough for me.</li>
<li> so this is to be expected.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m pale and mixed with black and Puerto Rican.</li>
<li> and I have an average, not large, head.</li>
<li> First off this wig is super crazy thin!  </li>
<li> and I will say the lace is not too dark at all.</li>
<li> I like the dark roots look</li>
<li> The style is good the color is awful!!!</li>
<li> even using a wig brush made it a little frizzy too.</li>
<li> The only thing is she is THIN.</li>
<li> Unless I got an odd product, it runs small and I would just want to alert anyone contemplating on this purchase--</li>
<li> It runs very small.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s such a bad wig!</li>
<li> just thin!</li>
<li> Looks weird on me though.</li>
<li> It looked too fake</li>
<li> oh I almost forgot she do sheds alot which wasn&#x27;t too bad because I don&#x27;t know hair that don&#x27;t</li>
<li> its awful!!!!</li>

    <li> The hair is gorgeous. Looks weird on me though. Might look better on somebody else. I&#x27;m pale and mixed with black and Puerto Rican. It looked too fake</li>
    <li> I love this front lace by far the best synthetic wig i ever perches. and it curls really good for under 30$ you can&#x27;t beat that</li>
    <li> its a great wig for the price, however it is a very thin wig. even using a wig brush made it a little frizzy too. love the color with the roots. looks very realistic. just thin!</li>
    <li> Seller had fast shipping item as described color was amazing and would buy from again thank you this wig is great my only complaint is for the company that makes the wigs not this seller but it could use a little more hair its a bit thin but its do-able.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as full as I wanted but overall it&#x27;s a great wig! Everyone thought it was real! I will order again.</li>
    <li> I loved Zen , I purchased the wig based on YouTube reviews that I saw . The only issue I have is that I could never wear it without a hat on . I don&#x27;t like the way the top of the wig looks, it doesn&#x27;t blend well into my real hair. The color on the top of the wig is a weird brown color. But I wore it with cute hats and I love the way it looked. The texture is nice. The wig is pretty long too. Not really any complaints besides the top portion of the wig.</li>
    <li> Love love love zenn I&#x27;ve had her twice shipping was pretty fast and the wig is Amazing not to mention I decided to wear her during labor with that being said she holds up pretty good to be synthetic anyway after that I kept her for like another 6 months not wearing her everyday of course when the wig is old u definitely will know the hair gets kind of stiff but a wash and conditioner would help with that and she takes good to the hot water method as well oh I almost forgot she do sheds alot which wasn&#x27;t too bad because I don&#x27;t know hair that don&#x27;t but I will say the older she gets the more she sheds!!!</li>
    <li> i love the wig munis the fact that it every thin i looks alot fuller via the picture&lt;br /&gt;your goin to have  to add wefts to it to make it a lil bit fuller</li>
    <li> This is a great wig, it falls really nice. But I put two of them together, because one is not full enough for me. Great color, I bought 6 of them.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money by far</li>
    <li> Can u flat iron this hair can u wear the wig out with your edges out</li>
    <li> it is a great wig it has everything it says it is a little thin at first you need to brush it but one this i recommend unless you want it permanently straight  DONT STRAIGHTEN IT whatever i try it wont curl back it is heat resistant when youre straightening it but it wont hold a curl afterwards its a big dissapointment i may order another one so i can keep it and just have this straight one and a curly one</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. I wore it for halloween and more women stopped me and asked where I got it from.</li>
    <li> This shipper was FINE! I give 2 stars to this product...FOR THE FIT.  It runs very small.  It looks okay, but I can&#x27;t wear it and I have an average, not large, head. Unless I got an odd product, it runs small and I would just want to alert anyone contemplating on this purchase--esp if you have a large head (don&#x27;t even try!). That really is a shame as it looks fine. Again, this shipper I used was fine as well. Best of luck to you :)</li>
    <li> Perfection! I straightened it and love the look.</li>
    <li> First off this wig is super crazy thin!  The style is good the color is awful!!! I like the dark roots look but this one is way off. I got it in the lightest blonde with the dark roots but the roots are greasy looking and not the kind of greasy looking that you can fix. .there no fixing it. You can see the tracks plain as day on the top and on the back of the wig. I after seeing nothing could be done with it the way it came I Tried brushing her and just got frizzy then straightness it and the talks show even more it&#x27;s such a bad wig! gave it to my niece to play with! its awful!!!!</li>
    <li> Hair was not color it was suppose to be and was very tangled wish could of sent it back for my money</li>
    <li> This is a good wig the curls are really good and you can also straighten it this is my main wig keep ordering more of them want to try the red one</li>
    <li> It was a very cute wig but it was too thin in the middle. I could see the hair tracks.</li>
    <li> This wig is beyond amazing I got the same color as the pic gorgeous color and&lt;br /&gt;Amazing style I wear it every week!</li>
    <li> I bought Lydia first and liked it so much I ordered Zenn in DR613. Its beautiful and arrived on time. I NEVER wear curls but these are different- they are so pretty I love them</li>
    <li> I love this wig, haven&#x27;t worn one in years but this one was the best one I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
    <li> My daughter got this to wear after she had her head shaved for charity.  She didn&#x27;t wear it often but when she did she turned heads.  Very dramatic and quite stunning.</li>
    <li> This wig REALLY cute, especially for the price. The only thing is she is THIN. Like you can see tracks in the back if you aren&#x27;t careful. I teased her the f**k out for some volume but there&#x27;s little i can do to hide the back from showing completely. Also she tangles like REAL easy, more so than any other synthetic wig I&#x27;ve had. My last gripe is the cap is really small and the hairline by the ears ends VERY far back on me so I have to cover the sides with hair but I am a man with a big man head so this is to be expected. But once again for the price it is a great piece especially for a lace front and I will say the lace is not too dark at all. I have tan olive skin and with some makeup it blends in perfectly. I think I&#x27;ll order her in another color honestly.</li>
    <li> Delivery was very quick. And I really enjoy my wig</li>
