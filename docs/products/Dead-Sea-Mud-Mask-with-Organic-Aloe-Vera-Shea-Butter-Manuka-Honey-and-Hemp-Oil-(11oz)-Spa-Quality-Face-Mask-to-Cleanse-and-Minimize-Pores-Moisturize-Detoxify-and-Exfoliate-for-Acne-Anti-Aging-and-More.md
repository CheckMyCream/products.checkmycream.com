<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Left skin soft. Good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Leaves your face super clear, smooth and moisturized. I love how tight it makes your face while having it on. I feel like my face resets every week!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!! I def used it and let it dry...works beautiful. Your skin is sooo clean and feels so soft! Doesn&#x27;t smell good, and its unscented, but totally worth it! If I&#x27;m in a rush I use it as cleanser and just apply and washcloth off...amazing. Highly recommended!!! Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> Love how it tightens my skin and makes it soft. It was a little stinky but I think it&#x27;s more of a natural mud smell:)</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll feel a difference after just one use of the mask. The Era Organics unique formula is enhanced with organic ingredients including manuka honey, aloe vera, shea butter, and hemp oil for added healing and moisturizing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know... the Dead Sea is the only place in the world with this particular combination of exclusive spa benefits: peculiar sun radiation and climatic conditions, enriched oxygen atmosphere, mineral-rich salt sea, thermomineral springs, and mineral-rich mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan of this mask! Era Organics has two different scents (I prefer unscented, but haven&#x27;t tried the grapefruit) and you don&#x27;t need to add water or do any mixing. It&#x27;s ready to use when you open the jar. The mud removes excess oil and dead cells from the skin&#x27;s surface, and I prefer to focus my application on and around my nose where my pores are biggest. After 15 minutes and then washing away, my skin feels soft and refreshed - certainly much better than it had before.</li>
    <li> I love using this!  Makes my skin feel clean &amp; smooth with no weird ingredients.</li>
    <li> Smell so bad and discusting</li>
    <li> I received my Dead Sea Mud Therapy jar today and it arrive in one piece, no cracks on jar or anything. Looking forward to trying it out.</li>
    <li> Okay folks, again, I&#x27;m a 60 year old guy and I&#x27;ve been working on my face now for about a year, so I&#x27;m much more sophisticated than I was in the beginning, and I&#x27;ve gotten my routine down to 4,5 effective products applied simply in 7-10 minutes, more or less. But, as \\&quot;Era&#x27;s\\&quot; \\&quot;Complete\\&quot; moisturizer is my favorite of all tried, I figured I&#x27;d give this mud a go...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  All I can say is that my face felt so fantastic after I rinsed this stuff off, I didn&#x27;t want to spoil it by applying anything else to it! I was totally stunned by the effect of just smearing mud on my face and letting it dry to dirt! I know I&#x27;m going to be doing it as often as I&#x27;m able! This is just teriffic stuff, which shouldn&#x27;t really surprise me, these people at \\&quot;Era\\&quot; have done their homework and seem to really endeavor to produce the highest quality products at a truly competitive cost, I&#x27;ve tried the 3 I know about and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
    <li> Very nice facial mask. With having natural ingredients and being unscented worked great for my combination skin. After using it my pores were tighter and skin felt smoother. I just followed the instructions that came with it and it worked wonderful. Looking forward to having nice even skin with tight pores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for review and LOVED it ... doesn&#x27;t sting my face or turn my skin red.  Love the earthy fragrance/smell and my favorite part is the texture *I&#x27;m a texture girl*, it&#x27;s somewhere between a cream and a gel.  LOVE it !</li>
    <li> I am not sure what I was expecting as far as smell - but it smells like dirt.  Which makes sense because its a mud mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came in a jar just like the one pictured.  Sealed by a plastic wrap that was easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time using the product - I put the mask on about 20 minutes before I got in the shower.  Seems easier to me to remove. It seemed cool on my face.  I could feel it drying and that was pretty amazing.  Of course my family looked at me like I was crazy. But they usually do.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got out of the shower I just patted my face dry.  My skin felt amazing.  It was so soft to the touch and even after one use I noticed my pores were not as prominent.  I just cannot tell you how great my skin feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used a mud mask before and I am so glad I waited to try Era Organics.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This 100% NATURAL, ORGANIC dead sea mud mask is wonderful! I will warn you though, if you&#x27;ve never used or SMELLED the dead sea minerals, you may be taken aback and may want to get the scented formula instead of this one that is unscented. It has its own, very distinct scent.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never heard of the dead sea muds, they&#x27;re said to be the best products you can use. They&#x27;re wonderful for purifying, moisturizing, exfoliating and healing your skin. So when you add in other well known and familiar contents such as shea butter, sunflower oil, manuka honey, glycerin, hemp oil, aloe vera and other natural organic ingredients, you know that you&#x27;re getting a high quality, high performance product that you can count on and trust to use on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;This company carries many organic products. Those that I&#x27;ve tried are excellent and well worth using. I recommend women and men to start a regimen of these products and restore your skin to he way it was meant to be.</li>
    <li> I got the chance to buy this at a reduced rate. I have to say I am impressed!! By my first interaction with the company, which went above and beyond to help me with a discount code, I was very pleased. Reading through the reviews before I tried the product, I was anticipating a strong unpleasant odor. While it wasn&#x27;t all fun and games (it&#x27;s no berry or vanilla! ;)) it wasn&#x27;t over powering and was pretty much what you would expect from a mud mask made with all natural ingredients. It dried quickly, and came off easy in the shower (I imagine it would work the same with a wet cloth in the sink, it was easier for me to apply before showering). My skin feels awesome and looks better. I intend to be a customer for a long time!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin so smooth!</li>
    <li> I love masks. I love the way they make my skin feel. This mask draws out impurities and leaves my skin feeling clean. I cleaned my face with my normal cleanser and then used this mask. I left it on for about 25 minutes or so. It didn&#x27;t burn or cause any discomfort. It easily washed off and I was able to use my favorite moisturizer. It definitely felt like my own personal spa day.</li>
    <li> this stuff is Awesome !!! My 5 Yr.old daughter wanted to try it so with all the natural ingredients I felt completely confident letting her try it as well !! we had a blast it was so much fun we will be doing it again real soon !! here are some specific things I love about this product&lt;br /&gt;Organic Dead Sea Mud Mask (11oz) Spa Quality Facial Mask Enriched with Aloe Vera, Shea Butter, Manuka Honey and Hemp Oil for Extra Moisturizing and Healing Power - Help Treat Acne, Cleanse and Minimize Pores, Remove Blackheads and Reduce Wrinkles - Sooth, Moisturize, Detoxify and Exfoliate to Leave Healthier, Softer Skin. Also Available in Pink Grapefruit Mint. by Era Organics  I love that it is made in America and how it feels on your skin it feels soooo nice !! and you can not beat  their offer. they really want you to love your skin, which is why we offer a 60-day money back guarantee!! 60 Days !! who does that ? In my opinion this is an amazing product and a fantastic company !! I 100% recommend this product !</li>
    <li> Great product! My skin feels so soft and looks great! It stinks, but it&#x27;s well worth the results!!</li>
    <li> Amazing.  Smells horrible, but benefits are worth it.  Love what it does for my skin.  Great for acne for sure. Shipping was quick too.</li>
    <li> Okay, the smell is not great, but the mask FEELS great! Love the organic factor, love the quantity in the jar!</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff is amazing, just got it and only used it once so far and my skin never looked better after just one application!</li>
    <li> I bought this and gave myself a homemade spa day. It made me feel as if I was really at the same. My face felt so smooth after using however I do not care for the smell. The smell is not horrible considering it is mud therapy and mud masks usually all smell. This one does not smell as bad as most though.</li>
    <li> This mask is great! I used it last night and right away my face felt smoother and more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Other masks I have used leave my face super dry by was so happy about this one! Definitely going to keep using this! 👍</li>
    <li> I received this for review and i couldnt get past the smell. I never got it to my face because the smell was so strong.</li>
    <li> My skin feels hydrated and refreshed. I am starting to see lines and wrinkles at 41 years old and I think this is helping reverse that. I am so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> Looks yucky but does wonders for your skin.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to use it.  Wonderful for facial skin.  Will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> A++++ Product...Love it !!!</li>
    <li> this is a great product for creating your own little at home oasis. it feels great when you apply it and really rejuvenates your skin. its great for exfoliation and after its washed off your skin feels so soft and smooth. i have sensitive skin and often break out to anything i use on my skin but this was very gentle. you can tell it is made from high quality ingredients and even the packaging is pretty.</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Pink Grapefruit Mint mask.  After applying, it was very tingly at first.  I hope this lessens over time and use.  I left it on for 20 minutes and then removed it with a warm wash rag.  I was very happy with the results just with the first application!  My face was smoother and felt very refreshed!  I can&#x27;t wait to try it again in a few days!</li>
    <li> I was kind of off put from the smell but decided to try it out. Anything to do with facial at home is a go for this busy mom. I at that age where I am looking at my 20&#x27;s pictures and wanting that youthful look again. I used this dead sea mud mask and right away I noticed a tingle and my face firming up as the mud dried. After a few use I have noticed my skin looking soft, supple and brighter. Mud mask, especially the all natural is great to care for your skin and detox the skin.</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel moisturized and really smooth as soft. I took one star because of the smell. But I guess that&#x27;s what mud smells like. I can deal with it since this product is one of the more organic ones. And the tigling when u firat apply feels a little weird. other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law uses all organic and natural products...she was excited to receive this product...she loves the way her skin Feels</li>
    <li> This mask makes your face feel amazing.  You can feel it tighten as it dries.  After rinsing it, there is a noticable moisture about your skin, and smoothness.</li>
    <li> I was dying to try this!!Just knowing that this has ingredients from the Dead Sea &amp; it was a Mud Mask I just had to try it.I wanted to use this for my uneven skin tone.I used this on my clean face as per directions.It says not to contaminate jar by using hands so I scooped out some product in a jar so I can dip my hand in there without contaminating the main jar the product came in.I would suggest you try it that way you can preserve your jar from contamination. It feels really nice on your face.I definitely felt pampered for a little bit.It did tingle a little bit but nothing bothersome.It does say on the jar it will tingle.After 20minutes I washed my face and I love how easy it comes off.My face immediately looked more even toned, clean &amp; refreshed.I pat dried my face afterwards and it felt soo nice &amp; clean.I  Definitely will be using this to cleanse everyday.Its a great mud mask.</li>
    <li> Really does help with eczema. I have exczema on my back that I have developed in my mid 30&#x27;s drives me crazy. I used this everyday for about two weeks and now the eczema is not a problem.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mud mask that I have ever tried, and the only one that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  It makes my skin look brighter and clears our my pores.  I use it once a week and it&#x27;s been great for my skin. Plus, very little goes a long way, so it is a great bargain for how much you get!</li>
    <li> My skin feels great. My skin has improved a lot. The smell is bearable so it&#x27;s not really that much of a big deal for me. I can take it. Over all this product makes my skin smoother ..my acne are healing. I will be buying another one next time I hope I get a discount :)</li>
    <li> This left my skin feeling so soft!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Made my skin look and feel great!  Best exfoliating facial mask I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this item but it smells really bad so next time I will order the one that is scented..... My face does feel very clean and I like this mud but I just can&#x27;t stand how bad it smells to me.</li>
    <li> I love this mud mask and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. Very simple and comes with a good amount for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is silky and goopy, and the unscented version smells like salty mud (as it should). It &amp;#34;tingles&amp;#34; because the Dead Sea is famous for being a sulfuric hypersaline lake with more salt content than the oceans, containing minerals such as MAGNESIUM, ZINC, POTASSIUM, CALCIUM, MANGANESE, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 20 minutes, I wash it off totally effortlessly with no noticeable residue! Usually, my face gets awfully dry after a good washing and then tries to fix itself with an overload of moisture if left alone. After the mask, my face was soft, refreshed, and only barely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have very SENSITIVE SKIN. I haven&#x27;t broken out from this yet though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels soft, supple, and wonderful! Combined with their Complete Moisturizer (which outshines all other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used), my face feels totally heavenly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This is not a sponsored review. I purchased both products with my own money.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important thing to add though, the Dead Sea is an unsustainable resource as it is mined for minerals, water, while countless tourists flock for their spa vacation.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  No smell.  I ordered the unscented.  Do think this is my new favorite skincare company.  Get the moisturizer too.  You&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> Great product, quick shipping.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all...and I don&#x27;t think it smells like &#x27;mud&#x27; per se.  To me, it smells like a typical mud mask and a bit on the nice side too.  It definitely tightens skin and reveals smoothing, refreshed, and noticeably cleaner skin as well.  I love this and will continue to update when used more often :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They always shipped in a great timely manner!  And, they emailed me a personal message letting me know they really care about their costumers!</li>
    <li> I had this for a few weeks and was loving it, but one evening I went to use it and it was covered in what appeared to be green fuzzy mold on the top!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the smell at all! I like that it&#x27;s not too &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; or filled with chemicals that wreak havoc on your skin. Fantastic customer service, the company is so friendly and was a pleasure to deal with! Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was there was no seal attached (underneath the lid) so when I screwed off the lid I wasn&#x27;t expecting the product to fall out of the container a bit.&lt;br /&gt;My skin did feel great and refreshed afterwards. Will continue to enjoy using :)</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product!  I have suffered for over 6 months from severe pregnancy induced hormonal acne.  Having exhausted every other pregnancy &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; treatment with ansolutely no improvement, from prescription Finacea to glycolic acid, pregnancy skincare brands, and in-office extractions, I was depressed and in pain from the deep cysts.  I finally came across this product and was inspired to try it, based on the reviews.  The first time I tried it, I felt it detoxing and calming my skin... I woke up and the deep cystic breakouts had almost flattened,  and by the next day they were totally calm and just scars.  I really cannot believe how quick and effective it works!  Although nothing can stop the hormonal outbreaks,  this mask keeps those that have happened since small and cyst free.  I didn&#x27;t realize how all the other products had just been irritating my skin,  making the situation worse.  I am so greatful for this mask... and it feels like spa time when I wear it!  Thank you for the amazing product!</li>
    <li> Great mask, your skin feels exfoliated right after you rinse it off😃</li>
    <li> Nice product. Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time getting past the smell. I&#x27;m not too fond of the burning sensation I get. I always rinse with COLD water because of that.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my skin much smoother.</li>
    <li> Made my face super red and burned. :(</li>
    <li> Update: Changed from two to five stars. Great customer service. After I left the initial review, the owner Tyler contacted me and gave me a refund right away. Turns out I got a bad jar. I received a new one (Grapefruit scented) and it works great. It doesn&#x27;t stink and it doesn&#x27;t separate into two different color tones after days of opening the jar. My face feels more moisturized now. Excellent product! I will buy again for sure.  I decided to try this product after getting good results from the Era Organics Facial Moisturizer. When I first opened the package for this, the smell was horrible, extremely bad, but I still tried it. Even though I suffered 15 mins from the odor, my face did become smoother after I rinsed it off. Fast-forwarding to three days later, I was about it use it for a second time, however I changed my mind when I dipped my finger into the jar, the mask had two color tones. One tone is similar to the picture of the product and the second tone was more of a light cement color. The smell seemed to have gotten worse. I gave some to my friend to look at and she threw it out immediately. She said that while it smelled like the very bottom of a deep sea, it also smelled like something went sour. In the end, I also threw it out. The smell became too overwhelming and the sudden change in the color of mask wasn&#x27;t helping it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been about a month and when I opened it up today, there was mold inside, so I&#x27;m definitely not using it anymore.. I recommend keeping it refridgerated to prevent that from happening (which is generally a good idea when dealing with more natural products).  My skin type: very dry, very sensitive, acne-prone. I only used it about 6-7 times, and it was just okay. Didn&#x27;t really do much for my skin. It wasn&#x27;t overly drying like a lot of other masks on the market - still used a moisturizer afterwards, but that&#x27;s nothing new with my skin. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin so that&#x27;s a plus. Didn&#x27;t do anything to help with acne.  I was going to use it for several months/until it was empty before leaving a review to hopefully get past any sort of detoxifying stage and give a more thorough review, but if it&#x27;s just going to get all moldy within a month I&#x27;m not even going to waste my time. I kept it in a cool, dry place (not my bathroom) and I used wooden craft sticks/wax applicators to scoop the product out in order to help prevent something like this from happening, but oh well.</li>
    <li> This just increased my acne. So i discontinued using it and it just sitting there.</li>
    <li> i will admit this stuff doesnt smell the greatest but it makes my skin feel really good!!</li>
    <li> This mask does wonder! I was skeptical about buying another &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; mud mask but this surprises me! My skin actually comes out radiant and not DRY! Other brands I&#x27;d tried dried out my skin and had such stinky odor.</li>
    <li> Hello Amazing!!!!!  I could hardly wait to try this out.... as soon as the package arrived I was in the bathroom....lol!  Followed the directions of course, and then just relaxed.  I get to do that only during school hours..Thank goodness mSail runs early.  After I washed it off my face felt amazing... even my son said I looked good when he got off the bus after school.  How weird is that? A 10 year old thought I looked better!  I was like yeah mommy went to the Spa D&#x27; Jennifer...lol!  Its great! Gotta try this!  I received this for an honest and unbiased opinion.  THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> Used this when I had a spa evening in with the girls . Was a really great product left our skin feeling soft refreshed and smoother. Was no unsually smell was odor free easy to apply. Was just cool feeling after we applied to our skin.  Easy to rinse off once the product has dried.  Grab some today for your next girls night in.</li>
    <li> First i have to say that this is a really nice sized jar of mud therapy. It does have a slight smell to it but it is tolerable . It does take 10-20 minutes to dry depending on how thick you put it on. It goes on feeling nice and cool and easily. It does tingle but its a nice tingling sensation. Feels great going on and easily to remove with either a warm wash cloth and warm water or just to jump in the shower and wash my face off. Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth afterwards . I even use this  twice a day once in the morning and once in the evening to make my skin feel great. I love the packing of the jar as it looks like a very expensive spa jar also love that it is 100% natural ingredients . It is the first mud mask i have ever used and i do love it. I will continue to use this as a little bit goes a long way when applying this product. I did purchase this product for a discount for my honest thoughts and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. It goes on really nice and smoothly, and rinses off really well. My skin always feels awesome afterwards. I have to say, in the future I will be buying the scented version though, because this product smells exactly like what it is, mud. It&#x27;s totally worth it though.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and I felt it kinda irritating. I contacted the owner and he thought it might be because of allergy or impropriate storage of Amazon (as it smells like it went bad during the delivery). He&#x27;s super helpful and trying to send me a new product, and I&#x27;m waiting for it now!</li>
    <li> My skin didn&#x27;t like something in the ingredients because it made my face burn/sting. The company however is amazing with customer service and took care of my needs when I told them. They actually told me they were taking my feedback to their labs to improve the product.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin smooth and even,I use it every week.&lt;br /&gt;It reduces the wrinkles on my face.</li>
    <li> i feel my skin is burning when i used it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman of color and I don&#x27;t have ance but I was looking for something to give my skin that extra pop. So I got on Amazon and somehow got this product. I read at least 3 pages of reviews and just had to try to it. It&#x27;s like my skin is happy.. Lol. I didn&#x27;t experience tingling but the smell is not so good but I promise it works! My skin is softer and rejuvenated. I use it 3-4 times a week. It&#x27;s the best!! Everything to shipping and customer service was awesome! Try it you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This product smells terrible but it works amazingly and is well worth enduring the smell. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> I love this Dead Sea Mud Mask!  Well packaged, and 11 ounces will seem to last me quite a while.  Though I seldom use cleansers, exfoliators, I decided to give this product a blind try.  Best decision I&#x27;ve made.  I get this wonderful tingling sensation after I put it on, which I leave on for about 15-20 minutes.  Afterwards washing with warm water, my face is left feeling fresh, smoother, renewed and I&#x27;ve noticed the dark circles underneath my eyes are not so prominent which I&#x27;ve suffered years having dark circles.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy I came across this product and gave it a go.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Product molded! Had to toss it after three uses. I used a clean dry spatula to apply to my face. Not happy. Kept in medicine cabinet.  Very smooth. My husband and I used it and we both were excited about how smooth out skin felt after rinsing. We did feel the tingling but it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable. Noticed the thick white oil in my and my husbands nose pores drawn towards to surface of the skin so it certainly has drawing power when drying. We are African so it&#x27;s easier to see them.</li>
    <li> Works instantly! your skin feels smooth and new! smells a little funny, but thats because its all natural! will buy again!</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed this mask. I&#x27;ve never used one before and after I noticed my skin felt so smooth. Smoother than it&#x27;s ever been with any other face products I&#x27;ve used... I bought a brush to apply it and it&#x27;s a nice deep green/gray color.  It applies well and evenly. It gets right when it dries but isn&#x27;t uncomfortable. The smell isn&#x27;t that appealing but I found it easy to get used to. It just has an earthy scent to it. This was overall a really great mask and it came off really easily with just warm water. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> let me make this pellucidly clear... this stuff smells horrible... the scent is very off putting... but thats a small price to pay for the radiance it restores to my once dull face... i love it... i rated it four stars because ive only used it twice... but for those two times the results were very pleasing... looking forward to what extended usage produces...</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I love the Face Moisturizer Cream and their Moisturizing Facial Cleanser, but when it comes to the clay/mud mask I prefer Kiehl&#x27;s Rare Earth Pore Cleansing Masque more; I feel like Kiehl&#x27;s really gets my skin purified and deep cleaned.  This mud mask was great for a very light treatment, and my skin felt great afterwards, but I like the feeling of Keihl&#x27;s better.  Would still recommend you give this a try to find out what you prefer.</li>
    <li> Wow. Great product. Love it.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin feeling fresh and rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> REALLY SOFTENS AS IT TIGHTENS, and so pure!!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many natural masks over the years. All of them dry my skin, which I thought was a necessary evil of toning the skin.  Not this mask!  With its incredibly pure ingredient list, this humble looking pourable mud in a jar seems to differentiate what each skin cell on my face needs. My chronically flaky areas transformed before my eyes as the mask dried. And the typically oily sections were toned into clear, smooth suppleness.  This may sound like an over-the-top commercial, but it&#x27;s true. I rely on reviews myself, and get upset when people exaggerate.  Just a heads up that all the pure, unscented ingredients give this mask a light mud consistency with a color and light smell reminiscent of wet cardboard.  The purest mask I&#x27;ve ever seen, and it works wonders - very highly recommend!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful mask. I used it last night and my skin is so soft! I love that it exfoliates without having to use a grainy bead. It also healed two rough/flaky patches between my eyes and chin. It does smell very earthy, but I&#x27;m ok with that because it&#x27;s not pumped with perfumes. I absolutely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love it, my face feel so clean after using it. thank you.</li>
    <li> The mask is really high quality, you feel the results as soon as you remove it plus the customer service is exceptional! Definitely repeating!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this mask.  I already liked the e-ra organics line but this mask was like icing on a cake.  Some complained about the smell but it smelled like mud to me...not overly scented with perfumes and dyes.  I was excited to try it and even more excited AFTER i tried it.  I have combination skin and get acne while I&#x27;m fighting wrinkles so I&#x27;m really stuck trying to find a mask that will not dry out my skin but won&#x27;t leave it oily either.  This mask fit the bill.  It tingled a little but it was nice.  I&#x27;m not sure if it has menthol in it because I didn&#x27;t smell it but that&#x27;s what it felt like.  When I washed it off, my skin felt amazing.  But, the real test was after sleeping.  Masks tend to feel good immediately after removing but then my face goes into overdrive producing oil.  The next morning, my face still felt clean. GREAT MASK!</li>
    <li> Has a nice soothing tingle when applied, exfoliates good and really adds clearer smoother skin, no complaints!</li>
    <li> Nice mask, made my skin so soft!  I was happy to recieve this product for review.</li>
    <li> I like this- not too drying and leaves my skin soft and fresh.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so soft. Just after using it a week my skin feels so soft and clean. I love this stuff! It smells a bit strong but it works wonderfully. They have a new grapefruit one that I am excited to try.</li>
    <li> Excellent mask. I have been buying natural facial masks when I find them and trying several different brands/types. This is a good one. Makes your skin feel tingly and invigorated afterwards.</li>
    <li> I like the the way this felt on my skin. My skin felt clean and smooth when I removed it. The smell was a little strong at first but then I got used to it.</li>
    <li> My skin has been suffering from the winter doldrums -- dry, flaking and dull looking.  This mask did a great job of tightening and moisturizing my skin.  Even though I looked pretty silly while wearing it -- my husband and son teased me! -- the final result was well worth it.</li>
    <li> love it, it&#x27;s great for mommy/ daughter spa night.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I was having problems with dryness, but since I have used this mask it has helped remove my issues. I have been using it for a few months and I have noticed a significant difference in the way my face has changed and it&#x27;s all for the good! I promise that you&#x27;ll love this product if you&#x27;re looking for a different mask!</li>
    <li> Very top quality mask for the price. Helps keep pores clean.</li>
    <li> Very relaxing to use. Feels like a spa day at home! I will keep using it and will even do a couple facials for my girlfriends/family so they can test it out as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once...it did it&#x27;s job, but was super stinky...</li>
    <li> Great mud mask for you whole body... Want the whole spa experience at home? Here it is! I added essential oils and viola beauty in a jar! Huge jar, can do whole body several times.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic mud mask. It does wonders for my skin. The dead sea mud stimulates my skin and cleans out the pores. I put it on my face, neck and decolletage a little while before I get in the shower and then wash it off with the Era Organics Cleanser. Afterwards I use the Era Organics Complete cream. They all have similar, great and natural ingredients such as Manuka Honey. People have been commenting on how young I look since I&#x27;ve been using it. I&#x27;m 60 years old and my skin is feeling and looking great and the wrinkles have greatly diminished. The jar lasts a long time so it&#x27;s very economical. I highly recommend this mud therapy mask to my friends and family and plan to give it as gifts.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve used it now for over 2 months. I use it once a week and have seen a difference in my skin. It helps to keep my pores unclogged! I love that its made with organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> Wellll, I got my mask and it smelled a little terrible. It was pretty unbearable to have on my face. BUT I have to say, I heard from Tyler, the owner of Era Organics after expressing my dissatifaction and he was amazing and overnighted me a new tub the mask. Amazing customer service! Just used my new tub and applied a mask tonight and it is amazing. Thank you Era!</li>
    <li> I treated myself to a at home spa experience today and used this mask - first the smell was pretty bad - enough that my kids told me I smelled.  Once applied it tingled/stung a bit though this did go away once it started to dry.  I will say that my skin felt very nice after using this mask.  I would like to try it again maybe I just got one that was &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34;...</li>
    <li> What a great mask! I love the natural smell it has, I love that spa, clean, freshly pampered smell that just makes you feel like you&#x27;re a million bucks. This black jar gives me the opportunity to sink into my bathtub, soak in some bubbles and have a little pamper session without the spa price tag that always gets in the way. The Era Organics Dead Sea Mask goes on nice and smooth and I personally leave it on 15 minutes so I can listen to about 3 of my favorite songs. Then I rinse it off and pat my face dry.&lt;br /&gt;This affords me the little bliss and serenity that I need after some of the long days I have with my beautifully energetic toddler!</li>
    <li> Ok, to be fair to this company, I have very sensitive skin BUT...&lt;br /&gt;Within seconds of applying this to my face, the extreme burning started - so bad that my eyes watered, I almost hyperventelated and could not get this rinsed off fast enough.  Even after it was rinsed off, the burning continued for hours and left my skin feeling just like I had done a chemical peel!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know which ingredients in this are the ones that caused the reaction but I read the list carefully BEFORE I purchased this - making sure there was nothing I knew I was sensitive to.&lt;br /&gt;I always read reviews on every skin care product I buy to get an idea of how the products work for others - especially those with sensitive skin like me - and there were no red flags here.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad this works for so many people but I feel obligated to give an honest review to hopefully save someone who also has sensitive skin from having a bad reaction like I did.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, this company stands behind their products  and is allowing me to return it for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to take a photo of my bright, purple face and bloodshot eyes following this frightening home spa experience, but it was way too scary!&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping to have success with this mask :(  Once the layers on skin on my face grow back, I will look for another mask to try!&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone else...</li>
    <li> The facial mask works great, but my problem after using it after a couple months is that awful smell. I have three other different dead sea masks and they don&#x27;t smell as bad as this one. It smells like mud on a hot day. If you can get pass the smell then you should be fine.</li>
    <li> Love how it feels after you wash it out. However, it has a irritating smell.</li>
    <li> Yes guys organic masks are best! This mask is no exception. With this one you know you are not putting some chemical crap on your face. Sure you can sacrifice nice smell right? They are called organic for a reason. I felt I am in a spa getting an expensive face treatment with earthy smell. My face felt super clean with unclogged pores. Super awesome product! I loved facial cleanser by the same company too. Good job Era Organics!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin really soft. Doesn&#x27;t have a peasant smell though.</li>
    <li> This is a great mud mask that really leaves your skin shiny and smooth without breaking you out (my face was mildy red afterwards, but lightened up as I cooled down generally).  I&#x27;ve used this mask twice now over two weeks on my face and decolletage and I already feel the rougher skin around my jaw line getting a little smoother.  I&#x27;ve always had this problem, regardless of the moisturizing and exfoliating products I use, and finally I feel this mud mask may be doing the trick.</li>
    <li> my skin is very sensitive. after using this mask， all part of the skin become red and unstable. I use it for feet now.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Organic dead sea mud, how could you get better than that. Used it many times. Love the way it leaves my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Not a fan... The smell makes me sick to my stomach</li>
    <li> Updated Review: I love the product. The company sent me a new one for free and issued me a refund after my older one had been compromised and caused me to break out. I love this company!&lt;br /&gt;Previous Review:&lt;br /&gt;It may just be that I am allergic to one of the ingredients - but my face broke out in bright red hives and really burned and itched! I don&#x27;t know what it was… I usually really like the company and have never had a reaction to one of their products. My friend used it as well and while she didn&#x27;t break out, she said her face also burned quite a bit. Make sure you examine the ingredients before purchasing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy i got this product to test and review for free, I have poor circulation in my skin, it also lead to an uneven skin tone and dark spots on my face. I have excess oil that clog my pores that lead to acne. Well I&#x27;m starting the healing process with my troubling skin by useing Dead sea mud mask, so far it has left my skins feeing moisturize n with a healthy glowand soft to the touch i love the way my skin feels, i&#x27;m excited about this product and i will definitely be using bsl daily routine. It also works great for my son Eczema! Awesome. This product is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love mud masks! It tingles on my face but thats it</li>
    <li> funny smell, but all masks seem to have .i feel refreshed and fresh out of a spa when im done with this. love it.</li>
    <li> I tried this product to help with my skin during the harsh cold weather.  It really make my face feel hydrated and even my wrinkles seems less obvious.  I have used other products from Era and they all have exceeded my expectations.  I have sensitive skin and didnt have any issues.</li>
    <li> I have used mud masks all throughout my teenage years and adulthood.  Finally, at 40 years old, I have found what I&#x27;ve always been looking for.  After one use, my face was sleek, smooth, and tight enough that my forehead fine lines were gone.  I cannot say enough how amazed I am with this product!  You will actually feel this working for you.  It is THAT good.  Thank you Era Organics for a super-professional quality mask that yields fantastic results!  Will definitely buy again and again!!</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this dead sea mud mask.  When you first open it there is definitely an order, even though it claims to be &amp;#34;odorless&amp;#34;.  Once you get past the odor and apply the mask it is great!  It&#x27;s easy to apply, the texture is nice and feels great going on.  Once it is on it doesn&#x27;t take too long before you start to feel it drying and doing it&#x27;s &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;.  To wash it off I would suggest using a warm, wet wash cloth.  I did it by hand the first time and it took a bit longer.  Once it is off you will feel and see the results, smooth skin that seems that looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> I like it, I really do.....I just can&#x27;t get past the smell.  With it being all natural there are no scents added to the mask so it just smells like the natural mud smell.  Once on your face you kinda get used to it but, you will need to wash your skin after to get the smell off, my husband said he could still smell it on my face.</li>
    <li> era organics really does stick with the premise of organic ingredients and no preservatives. This is the second product I have gotten to try from them, but it was disappointing. I make a lot of my own beauty and skin treatments, so I know what dead sea mud smells like without any scents. I was expecting an &amp;#34;earthy&#x27; smell, but this.. it smelled rancid. I added some essential oils to it to try and cover the smell but alas, it wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is why I am rating it 5 stars: I emailed customer service around 9 PM local time on a friday after I got the product to see what was up with the odor. I got a response within ten minutes offering to replace the product and do whatever it takes. I have a feeling that the issue they have is with Amazon fulfillment. The warehouses that amazon keeps their products in usually are hot and if the product sat throughout the summertime, the heat will affect the product, and the smell that i got was from that. My interactions with their customer service confirmed my suspicions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are high end, and I was impressed with the packaging and quality, excepting the rancidity. The fact of that, the customer service response, and their dedication to my satisfaction makes me willing to try this again. They are coming out with a scented version soon, and I am looking forward to trying that.</li>
    <li> My skin felt awesome after using this mask!</li>
    <li> This is very nice. My skin felt tighter and softer after using it. I will certainly use it now on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the quality! My skin feels so refreshed afterwards!</li>
    <li> The mask works well to pull the &amp;#34;ick&amp;#34; out of my skin.  It does have a rather odd smell to it, but it is tolerable.  It is the perfect addition to my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I tried this dead sea mud  on my face and I have to say that I really loved how this made my face feel. The first time I used this product my face got brighter. My pores got smaller or they look like they got smaller. I didn&#x27;t like the smell but I try it anyway and Im very happy I did try this mud on my face.</li>
    <li> 5 stars is not enough to do this and all of the Era Organics products any justice. I am completely in love with these products. This mask takes very little to cover the entire face and neck. It goes on smoothly and feels amazing from the moment you apply it.  I got the grapefruit -mint scented mask and love it. It is not strong or overpowering and it takes away from the mud smell lol. I have used other dead sea masks and all of them pale in comparison to this one. Their mix of organic ingredients is like no other I have ever seen or tried. I left the mask on while I showered and felt the tingling almost immediately and it reminded me of a spa treatment. As I showered I could feel the mask drying and tightening and it was a very good feeling. I washed the mask off in the shower and it washed off cleanly and quickly and the change in my skin was amazing. I am 44 years old and have started to get the sagging skin and a few wrinkles around the eyes and when I checked in the mirror my skin actually looked tighter around my eyes and the wrinkles were just about invisible. The skin under my neck felt tighter too! I also have a problem with blackheads in my nose and amazingly after just one application there were less visible blackheads. I have used so many products for this and nothing has ever worked until now.  I am hooked! The jar is large and since you only have to use a small amount, it should last a good, long time!  I am a huge fan of manuka honey and it has amazing healing properties so I tend to favor products that use it. I don&#x27;t know where they came up with this mix of ingredients but it works perfectly!! If you are looking for an organic product that exfoliates, detoxifies, treats acne, reduces wrinkles and tightens the skin, moisturizes, and helps with skin problems such as psoriasis and eczema, you don&#x27;t need multiple and expensive products. This mask does it all.  Use it with the cleanser and the repair cream and you have a knock out combination!! Era Organics.... where have you been all my life????</li>
    <li> Will never know if this works because when I opened it up for the the first time, my toddler, who was in the bath with me, started gagging uncontrollably and almost threw up from the smell!! This is a true story. The scent is, to put it nicely, putrid. Haha! If I was her age and less in control of my gag reflex I would of gagged too. We threw it away. Might be a good product if you can get past the absolutely awful smell. Maybe the scented one is less offensive to the senses.</li>
    <li> This mud mask is awesome! I&#x27;ve been buying a super expensive 1.4 ounce mud mask for double this price. This one is was better! My skin feels extremely soft and hydrated right after I use it. My pores look visibly smaller. This mask helped exfoliate the dry patches of skin I have thanks to the winter. I love this stuff and was pretty impressed with my results. *Sample provided for testing and review*</li>
    <li> This is an awesome facial mask.  I struggle with oily skin and shine on my forehead, but my cheeks are often dry.  This mask has helped correct a lot of my skin imperfections, my skin isn&#x27;t oil anymore and my pores are smaller in appearance.  This mask not only works well, but the ingredients are natural and it doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> OH my gosh my face is sooo soft and clean after using this...I&#x27;m in love with it! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> They have two variant, if you don&#x27;t have any issue with scent, ask for that and it&#x27;s lovely.    Seller is excellent on response.    I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing mud mask! I read one of the reviews that said this product has a rancid smell, but for what it does to my face, I&#x27;m willing to smell it (personally, I didn&#x27;t think the smell was that bad)!  I felt my skin tightening as the mask dried; it felt like I was getting a bit of a face lift!  I would definitely recommend trying this product if you&#x27;re looking for something to tighten things up a bit.  I am excited to continue to put this product to the test and see the long term results on my face!</li>
    <li> need more time to use it, but no tingling detected, so far so good</li>
    <li> Masks are a part of my skin care routine and I love to try new masks. This mask from e-raorganics is all organic.I have heard about dead sea mud and how it cleanse the skin and is also good for skin. this mask also contains kaolin clay and manuka honey (my favorite). Everyone know now about manuka honey since the news of Royals in UK using it...lol. But it really is an excellent product for your skin. It gives skin moisture and also plumps the skin. I applies this mask when I got it last week and left it for half an hour. Washed it with a washing cloth and it left my skin clean and smooth. I can see my skin is radiant and fresh. Happy with this mask.</li>
    <li> nice mask, skin feels soft.</li>
    <li> too soon it grew mold and it hurt when I used it right before that (after a month or two).</li>
    <li> Works great. The best I&#x27;ve run into over the years. I plan on continuing to use the mud mask.</li>
    <li> My skin looks amazing!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. You apply to your dry face and let it set for 10 mins. It tingles some but not in a bad way... More of a way of letting you know it&#x27;s working. For being a mud mask it doesn&#x27;t have the horrendous smell other mud masks have. When washed off it really leaves the skin feeling clean without being dried out and after 3 days I noticed it had really softened my skin. Being all organic a+ on my list.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Organic Dead Sea Mud Mask. This mud mask helps to moisturize, detoxify, heal, exfoliate, helps treat acne, and helps heal damaged skin. It comes in an 11oz jar and you don&#x27;t need to use much at a time so it will last a while. It is easy to apply and I left it on about 30 min. It was easy to remove, I just used a warm rag and wiped it off. When I took it off my face felt soft and refreshed and my skin looked so much better. I have such a hard time with my face getting dry, flaky and I battle acne every day and this mask really does help to get rid of all those problems so that my skin can be healthier. If you are looking for a good mud mask then you should give this a try. I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to put this on my face being that I have tried high quality stuff in the past and has left my face burning with blotches. But this stuff is amazingly great!</li>
    <li> Definitely a very nice muddy paste lile mask ready to go out of the box! As a guy i think this is pretty good. Definitely helps with moisturization and getting rid of acne. Has a very strong cooling effect on your skin, showing that its really working its magic. The smell is kinda earthy but you get used to it after couple of uses!</li>
    <li> You can use this 2-3 times a week and you leave it on for 10-15 mins at a time. I feel a difference immediately when I use this. Most clay and mud masks dry my skin out, which I was totally expecting with this. But this actually didn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all. In fact, it made it feel much softer both while I was washing the mask off and afterwards. Some masks that say they will tingle actually burn my skin after awhile or tingle too much, but this one is perfect. It really does just make your skin tingly, which I like. It also helps shrink the appearance of my pores and blackheads after every use, which is always a plus. This doesn&#x27;t smell like grapefruit mint, but I can&#x27;t really pinpoint exactly what it smells like. I don&#x27;t like the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has Aloe Vera, Manuka Honey, Shea Butter, Hemp Oil, and some other amazing ingredients in it. This mask is also ALL NATURAL, which is always a plus. It&#x27;s meant for fine lines/wrinkles, minimizing pores, treating and preventing acne breakouts, and so, so much more. It&#x27;s really multipurpose and can be used on the face or the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second item I&#x27;ve tried from Era Organics and have been very pleased. Both items are cruelty free and have manuka honey in them, which I&#x27;m a big fan of. Overall, this is a fantastic mask and the exfoliators in it really scrub my skin well, so it feels so soft and smooth after. You can really use this on your whole body, but I&#x27;ve only used it on my face so far. When I want a full spa day, I will use this on my whole body. I feel good knowing that this is all natural and has so many healing ingredients in it because I know I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin.</li>
    <li> My product smelled strange and seemed a little moldy. After a few uses, I threw it out and bought from another company. The difference in feeling was incredible, confirming the low quality of this specific product.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this product until a month after I purchase, I opened up the lid and green and grey mold was growing all over it.  Unfortunately, I cannot return it or inform the company of this defect.  If they will be will to replace the item, I will try it again in the event it is a fluke but, there is no way to contact them.  I will have to just assume, I am not the first person that this happened to.  The product was kept in a dark cool place so I can&#x27;t blame the temperature either.  Since it is no longer available on Amazon, I am going to assume I am not the first, but of many who experienced this same problem.  I advise you stay way from this product until they find out a way to prevent the growth of mold.  I am sure there is a way, as Cleopatra VII traveled to the Dead Sea for treatments and if she experienced mold, she&#x27;d be gone and the Dead Sea would not only be dead, no one would go there to this day!</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells nice, moisturises skins beautifully.</li>
    <li> I love the way they make my skin feel smooth and feel different. First thing is I cleaned my face with my normal cleanser and try to use mask and it works very well. Amazing that easily to wash it off. After that I use day cream. This mask is really amazing!</li>
    <li> Even though the smell is a little hard to handle its still a great product made my face feel really smooth and soft. Try it before you put a bad review! Learned a lesson lol</li>
    <li> I had an issue with my order and the seller was very quick to help me. I am very pleased with the customer service and love the idea of small businesses. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a bit now it took off some black heads which I was not expecting but very good it left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed just has a slight smell but nothing too bad u can smell the dead sea mud thats what the smell is I personally loved it got it at a great discounted price too! .</li>
    <li> This product is soooooo good!!!! My skin felt so incredibly soft after just one use and also looked much brighter!! This is an amazing product i just love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much! It does not make my skin dry like other similar products which I have tried before! I already recommended it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Good product. Great seller.</li>
    <li> Face looks refreshed and feels great. Spa like experience.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel super soft and firm after washing off. Smells earthy but I like all natural products because you know they are good for your skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Dead sea is known for its health benefits and healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients consists of - Dead Sea Mud, Organic Calendula Tea, Kaolin Clay, Hickory Bark Extract, Organic Shea Butter, Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Aloe Vera Juice, Mixed Tocopherols, Organic Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Manuka Honey, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Hemp Oil, Non GMO Xanthan Gum, White Thyme Oil.&lt;br /&gt;All the ingredients are natural and organic and is great for your skin. It does tingle for a minute when you apply it and then it sets up and dries off. You can wash it up after 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It is unscented and so you will not have any distinctive smell. I do not like the black muddy color of the face pack and i would prefer if an ingredient like rose water was added to give a mild refreshing smell to this. But otherwise this works great for the skin. It brightens and prevents wrinkles. It will also help fade away patches on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive this under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> I love how my skin feels after using this mask. I use it about 2-3 times a week. I don&#x27;t notice any long term difference but I have an oily skin and this mask definitely helps taking some of that oil away.</li>
    <li> I only used it once and so far so good. The product is all natural so there was no irritation on my skin</li>
    <li> Worked well.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this mask. My face really looks cleaner after use.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found out about this mask! This organic mask moisturizes and exfoliates your face with organic aloe vera and Shea butter, and the tingling sensation let&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s working! It is smooth going on and it has a slight smell, but nothing to make me not want to use it again! I use it twice a week and my skin feels moisturized and soft, and I&#x27;m glad I was introduced to this product!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about e-raorgainics.  Amazing products!  I have several of their skin care items and this dead sea therapy has been excellent for my legs.  It&#x27;s a real treat particularly in combination with the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love to use this for Acne Treatment It also treats  blemished skin, reduces redness, balances oily skin and prevents future breakouts. Super easy pore cleanser, pore minimizer, exfoliator and blackhead removal all in one acne mask. Treat chest and back acne and even reduce old acne scars.d removal all in one acne mask. Treat chest and back acne and even reduce old acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin super soft too and feels real clean</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I love masks and this one is awesome, of course it&#x27;s a mud mask so it does have a mud smell, but it&#x27;s not too overpowering. The mask dries in 10-15 minutes after I rinse it off, my face feels almost squeaky clean. Love it. My face feels nice and soft, definitely clean!  Plus my teens use it as a acne treatment, helps a lot to reduce redness of the blemishes! 11 oz jar is a great value, will last for a long time! Super happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this item it is the greatest thing I have ever used. I have used a lot of different kind of mask on my face over the years. This is best by far mask that I have ever tried. Every night after I get my bath I put this on my face and when I take it back off my face feels so much smoother and younger feeling than it ever has for a long time. It makes me feel so refreshed. I have had people say what have you done you look at least 5 years younger I just say it is a secret and thanks. It is the mudd mask I am using then I do tell them what it is and tell them to buy it and try it too. Thanks for the great item.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin feel so amazing. there&#x27;s a little smell but not bad.  I really enjoyed the fact it was all natural.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  Not the best smelling facial but really cleans skin.  It is not thick when spread on and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Loved this mask. After 1 use, my face looked noticeably refreshed and clearer. My pores were smaller and blackheads gone. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again. I followed it with the Era Organics Natural Skin Care Advanced Healing 10 in 1 Face Cream, which is absolutely wonderful too.</li>
