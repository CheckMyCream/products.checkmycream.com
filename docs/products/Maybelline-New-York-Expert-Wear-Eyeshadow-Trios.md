      <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>It feels good on, it goes on smoothly, it covers well.</li>
      <li>Best coverage I have found so far, it also illuminates your skin.</li>
      <li>super fats shipping!!</li>
      <li>It feels very light &amp; creamy going on</li>
      <li>I thought it was very light</li>
      <li>I end up taking off the top and using a q-tip to finish the product.</li>
      <li>but I think I need to apply more of it or try it with something else.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>it get some you will love as well.</li>
      <li>I like it even more than the foundation.</li>
      <li>You keep turning the top while it clicks</li>
      <li>and I do keep restocking them :)</li>
      <li>and I love how smooth it goes on.</li>
      <li>Better than many higher end products I have used.</li>
      <li>Also, twisting more than recommended the first time is more accurate.</li>
      <li>Because this is the best concealer on the market...and a little hint ...</li>
      <li>and I found this product to be light and weightless.</li>
      <li>Great product, but need more colors for dark skin women.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good enough for the price, though I expect a darker shade since I&#x27;m a tan person, around NC42 in mac.</li>
      <li>I found that this concealer was pretty self-explanatory and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Love this quick smooth under eyes coverup and the red nose easy to carry in purse for touch ups</li>
      <li>Love the product inside and the applicator, but more often than not the twist top stops working about half way through.</li>
      <li>Works great on dark eye circles and age spots.</li>
      <li>Covers really well, and easy to blend out.</li>
      <li>I only gave it 3 stars because it does not have very good lasting power as a concealer.</li>
      <li>It looked great when I put it on in both sunlight and artificial light, which is amazing since I have never had any experience with concealers.</li>
      <li>I REALLY LOVED THIS PRODUCT, IF YOU HAVE DARK CIRCLES</li>
      <li>and I will definitely be looking for more when the one I have right now runs out.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good for who use mac studio fix NW 45 or little darker or lighter ..</li>
      <li>Wish Maybelline would change something on this, because I like the actual concealer more than any others (maybe a wand style with a sponge at the end).</li>
      <li>It is only an applicator so more work is required once you apply it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s handy.soft and do nice cover dark line.</li>
      <li>I had previously bought the foundation and really liked it so thought I would try the concealer.</li>
      <li>Wish it would dry a little more and be more matte.</li>
      <li>Really terrific, I&#x27;ve never had as good coverage as this for my dark circles....</li>
      <li>One of my many tries at finding a new concealer.</li>
      <li>Very surprised!  </li>
      <li>and I have an affinity for high end products.</li>
      <li>I use it for dark circles, after bb cream or after foundation, it makes me look really awake such a huge difference between sleepy me and full on face</li>
      <li>I like the little applicator at the top.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have to worry about getting it on my cheeks because this concealer is not oily at all and blends really well with my natural skin</li>
      <li>But after a few more twists, concealer came out.</li>
      <li>My skin is normal not oily.</li>
      <li>Loved that is was so thin yet covered.</li>
      <li>Very natural looking.</li>
      <li>This was my first ever concealer, or facial makeup for that matter.</li>
      <li>There are lots of products out there which clam to do the same, but Maybelline seems to have done their homework very well before marketing these product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the sponge applicator to blend because I feel personally I apply too much pressure</li>
      <li>Personally, I leave the brush on, but I&#x27;m thinking about taking the brush part off to see just how much makeup is in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is so soft for the under eye.</li>
      <li>I am 60 years old &amp; dont sleep well</li>
      <li>The really need to reformulate their shades, when you consider there are bi-racial, tri-racial skin tones, not to mention their olive tone and African American shade selection!</li>
      <li>When I put it on, I barely feel that it&#x27;s there.</li>
      <li>It really works to cover dark circles.</li>
      <li>Um hmm, a mess and wasted products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the initial fiasco just a few clicks moistens the applicator with product and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>First, the seller had this at my door in less than 3 days!</li>

<li> First, the seller had this at my door in less than 3 days!</li>
<li> It will take at least twenty twists for it to come to the surface for the first time.</li>
<li> Not sure I&#x27;d buy this again even though the under eye puffiness and darkness is concealed very well.</li>
<li> you been in the industry too long not to recognize this.</li>
<li> I HAVE BOUGHT MANY CONCEALER PRODUCTS, very expensive &amp; now they sit in my make up draw...</li>
<li> I panicked and called Maybelline&#x27;s Customer Service for fear of a potential mess.</li>
<li> apply it not only on dark circles, but apply it under the dark circles in a v shape and extend it to the outer end of your eye &amp; blot it in...</li>
<li> but it really instantly conceals without looking heavy or cakey.</li>
<li> A few hours later it looked transparent.</li>
<li> I actually bought this in the color \\&quot;pale light.\\</li>
<li> It is extremely lightweight on the eyes.</li>
<li> a make up artist taught me, which is extremely helpful...</li>
<li> At first, I thought I had a faulty or dried up product because I twisted it</li>
<li> It&#x27;s totally germ-free, but some people have complained that the brush wastes a lot of product.</li>
<li> I choose a color a little to dark for me</li>
<li> But I have had 3 of these now, and every dispenser broke and was a mess.  </li>
<li> OR ANY LITTLE IMPERFECTION</li>
<li> Sad that it just wouldn&#x27;t last very long for me.</li>
<li> Wear it everyday</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 6 months now, it&#x27;s always been my life safer everyday as it conceals my blemishes and redness!</li>
<li> I paid hony for my real dark cycle after few mintus the color come gray !!</li>
<li> The sponge part did not work and it was really hard to get it saturated with the liquid</li>
<li> But, this makes it hard to store in my cosmetic drawer..</li>
<li> This isn&#x27;t a bad little concealer, at least for the money.  </li>
<li> I have bought the product twice and have broken both applicators.</li>
<li> unable to get it to flow out of container.</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>

    <li> I love it. it&#x27;s handy.soft and do nice cover dark line.</li>
    <li> Love this quick smooth under eyes coverup and the red nose easy to carry in purse for touch ups</li>
    <li> Works well and I love how smooth it goes on. Would recommend if you have raccoon eyes like I do.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Wear it everyday and I have an affinity for high end products.</li>
    <li> I love the product. It feels good on, it goes on smoothly, it covers well. I hate the applicator. I have bought the product twice and have broken both applicators. If they can change that, I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Really terrific, I&#x27;ve never had as good coverage as this for my dark circles....</li>
    <li> Good material. Good brand. Thank you.</li>
    <li> A lot lighter than the picture displayed</li>
    <li> Better than many higher end products I have used.</li>
    <li> I choose a color a little to dark for me but I got it in one day!! super fats shipping!! and the darker color still worked!! there amazing!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this in the color \\&quot;pale light.\\&quot; I have fair to medium colored skin.  I had previously bought the foundation and really liked it so thought I would try the concealer. I like it even more than the foundation. It feels very light &amp; creamy going on but it really instantly conceals without looking heavy or cakey. Blends perfectly. Very natural looking.</li>
    <li> Good coverage for undereye circles and good price. Does not streak and stays where you put it. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I use it for dark circles, after bb cream or after foundation, it makes me look really awake such a huge difference between sleepy me and full on face make  up me.</li>
    <li> Works great on dark eye circles and age spots. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I liked it. I thought it was very light and I had to cover it up with Bobbi Brown&#x27;s corrector but I think I need to apply more of it or try it with something else.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LOVED THIS PRODUCT, IF YOU HAVE DARK CIRCLES SOMETIMES, THIS WILL WORK WELL. IT COVERS THEM UP OR ANY LITTLE IMPERFECTION YOU MIGH THAVE! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Disappointing. The sponge part did not work and it was really hard to get it saturated with the liquid</li>
    <li> I have been using this make up for sometime now. It&#x27;s perfect for fine lines and imperfections.</li>
    <li> This was my first ever concealer, or facial makeup for that matter. I have never applied facial makeup ever before. At first, I thought I had a faulty or dried up product because I twisted it about twenty times and no concealer came out. But after a few more twists, concealer came out. So if you have this problem, just keep on twisting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I found that this concealer was pretty self-explanatory and easy to use. It is extremely lightweight on the eyes. When I put it on, I barely feel that it&#x27;s there. The color was spot on for my Asian skin with yellow undertones. It looked great when I put it on in both sunlight and artificial light, which is amazing since I have never had any experience with concealers. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about getting it on my cheeks because this concealer is not oily at all and blends really well with my natural skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is antimicrobial, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about bacteria growing on it. It&#x27;s totally germ-free, but some people have complained that the brush wastes a lot of product. Personally, I leave the brush on, but I&#x27;m thinking about taking the brush part off to see just how much makeup is in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this concealer has converted me to the Instant Age Rewind line and I will definitely be looking for more when the one I have right now runs out.</li>
    <li> Best coverage I have found so far, it also illuminates your skin. This is a must in my make-up routine.</li>
    <li> unable to get it to flow out of container.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BOUGHT MANY CONCEALER PRODUCTS, very expensive &amp; now they sit in my make up draw...Because this is the best concealer on the market...and a little hint ...a make up artist taught me, which is extremely helpful...apply it not only on dark circles, but apply it under the dark circles in a v shape and extend it to the outer end of your eye &amp; blot it in...it helps not to make it obvious u are wearing any concealer...Its just great...I am 60 years old &amp; dont sleep well &amp; it makes me look younger &amp; well rested...So I am very happy about Rewind...I just purchased the larger bottle</li>
    <li> love it and good coverage will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing it&#x27;s good for who use mac studio fix NW 45 or little darker or lighter ..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 6 months now, it&#x27;s always been my life safer everyday as it conceals my blemishes and redness! and I do keep restocking them :)</li>
    <li> Very surprised!  The container takes a while to click to get started!  I love this concealer color!  I wish Maybelline with their regular foundations shades!  I thought since it is a co-company of Loreal it would!  The really need to reformulate their shades, when you consider there are bi-racial, tri-racial skin tones, not to mention their olive tone and African American shade selection!</li>
    <li> First, the seller had this at my door in less than 3 days! Kudo&#x27;s to you for that!&lt;br /&gt;I tried the product for my under eye area and I found this product to be light and weightless. It does need some warming up to the skin, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with getting the product to come out either. It did take about 30+ clicks, no lie, but once it was working there were no problems.</li>
    <li> Great product, but need more colors for dark skin women.  Maybelline you been in the industry too long not to recognize this.</li>
    <li> El producto es bueno hasta que deja de funcionar el sistema para que salga el tratamiento. Lo tuve que abrir y resulta un desastre cada vez.</li>
    <li> One of my many tries at finding a new concealer. Loved that is was so thin yet covered. No creasing. Sad that it just wouldn&#x27;t last very long for me. A few hours later it looked transparent. My skin is normal not oily. It didn&#x27;t seem to slide off, it just simply vanished. Ended up with Urban Decay&#x27;s naked skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad little concealer, at least for the money.  But I have had 3 of these now, and every dispenser broke and was a mess.  I won&#x27;t be ordering another.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good enough for the price, though I expect a darker shade since I&#x27;m a tan person, around NC42 in mac.</li>
    <li> After a dozen twists of the burgundy band NO concealer saturated the applicator. I panicked and called Maybelline&#x27;s Customer Service for fear of a potential mess. The REP said \\&quot;The instructions should probably say you have to twist it for about THIRTY clicks to get it started\\&quot;. Bet you already know what happened? Um hmm, a mess and wasted products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the initial fiasco just a few clicks moistens the applicator with product and you&#x27;re good to go. Not sure I&#x27;d buy this again even though the under eye puffiness and darkness is concealed very well.</li>
    <li> Very bad .. I paid hony for my real dark cycle after few mintus the color come gray !!</li>
    <li> I like the little applicator at the top. It is so soft for the under eye. It is only an applicator so more work is required once you apply it. Also, twisting more than recommended the first time is more accurate. It will take at least twenty twists for it to come to the surface for the first time. After that it only takes 1 or 2 clicks. I only gave it 3 stars because it does not have very good lasting power as a concealer.</li>
    <li> Covers really well, and easy to blend out. I don&#x27;t use the sponge applicator to blend because I feel personally I apply too much pressure so I just use my fingers.</li>
    <li> Love the product inside and the applicator, but more often than not the twist top stops working about half way through. I end up taking off the top and using a q-tip to finish the product. But, this makes it hard to store in my cosmetic drawer.. Wish Maybelline would change something on this, because I like the actual concealer more than any others (maybe a wand style with a sponge at the end). Would give it 5 stars if not for the package flaw.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It really works to cover dark circles. I have 4 friends that use this stuff now. Don&#x27;t think about it get some you will love as well.</li>
    <li> Wish it would dry a little more and be more matte. It was very difficult to figure out how to get the liquid out of the bottle onto the sponge tip.  You keep turning the top while it clicks and then it releases drops of the liquid.</li>
    <li> Its works as described. You will not be disappointed with these results. There are lots of products out there which clam to do the same, but Maybelline seems to have done their homework very well before marketing these product.</li>
