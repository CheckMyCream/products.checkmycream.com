<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife has used Olay products since the mid 60&#x27;s and still uses it.</li>
    <li> Because of this and the regenerist night cream, I get a lots of compliments on my face and nake skin</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent price</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  I use this as a serum under Olay moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve tried many other creams and always come back to Olay.</li>
    <li> okay product, only been using for a couple of weeks, no noticeable change as of yet!</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I wouldn&#x27;t give it up.</li>
    <li> I see no change even  after my second bottle. I guess we&#x27;re eager to believe the hype.</li>
    <li> Love it! took 50% of the crepe paper look from my arms. Wish it could do more but this much improvement was a minor miracle! Wish I could bathe in it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks, but I do see a difference in my skin.  I&#x27;m sure I need at least two months to see a big difference.</li>
    <li> I bought three for my mother&lt;br /&gt;And i got them today but one of them has a problem&lt;br /&gt;Its lid is opened when it came&lt;br /&gt;so can&#x27;t use half of that :(&lt;br /&gt;Terrible&lt;br /&gt;I dont wanna give even 1 star</li>
    <li> Love this.  Great price and delivery.</li>
    <li> Ok Felt like it wasn&#x27;t full</li>
    <li> Great product. Definitely helps with the appearance of wrinkles. I stop using it (ran out) and notices the real difference it had made.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered more!</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin look and feel but then again Olay never disappoints. I have been using Olay since 1987 and every one always remakes that I look much younger then my actual age of 50.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum. I use it morning and night after cleaning my face and after using my treatments. I first found it by watching &amp;#34;Hot&amp;Flashy&amp;#34; on Youtube. She recommends it highly.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Delivered very quickly. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> I have only used this for 3 days and my skin feels amazing. After I wash my face, my skin looks blotchy and red. Putting this on instantly sooth my skin and even out the color. I put this on first, then the red jar regenerist cream for face. For eyes, I use clinique all about eyes. My skin feels great, hydrated, smooth, but not oily at all. Pores on my nose are actually getting smaller too. I guess I found my perfect regimen for skin care.</li>
    <li> A present for my mother on Mother&#x27;s Day</li>
    <li> I have seen a noticeable difference in the wrinkles by my eyes and my laugh lines.&lt;br /&gt;I makes my skin feel good, less dry.</li>
    <li> This serum is nice and lightweight, yet super moisturizing. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed improvements in my skin- it is more even and clear, also much more moisturized, I don&#x27;t even need to use moisturizer anymore, and I used to have very dry skin. It is excellent under makeup- no oiliness, foundation goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It has slight shimmer in it, it is not visible on the skin at all, but helps skin look more radiant and plump in a good way.This serum is much better than many high-end ones. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> use it all the time, very pleased</li>
    <li> Easily absorbed,moisturizing,great for oily skin</li>
    <li> This product may have been ok, but I will never know.  It arrived in appalling condition.  The product&#x27;s box was totally soaked with what appeared to be, and smelled like, some type of blue, sticky cleaning product.  The product box was definitely not sealed.  The product was placed in a manila envelope with very little bubble wrap for protection.  The seller never mentioned on the Amazon site that this product had damage.  When the package arrived, the damage was mentioned on the invoice, as an aside.  This is a very dishonest practice, to say the least.  This entire package reeked.  I could hardly be in the same room with it. I wondered how the mail carrier could stand to have it in his truck!  Needless to say, the whole thing had to be discarded.  This is no reflection on Olay products - they are always great.  But if I could give this seller NO stars, I would!</li>
    <li> Surely a great product. Unfortunately the pump does not function.</li>
    <li> The Olay products work very well for the price.  This one is especially noticeable after only a month or so of use.  We all age. We can not expect miracles.  Using a more expensive product will not necessarily get you better results.  I&#x27;ve tried. And tried again.  The Olay products are a good value and a quality product.  This specific product really is nice.  I like the fragrance free. I don&#x27;t need fragrance on my face.</li>
    <li> Lovely, silky texture, and it feels amazing on my face. A little bit goes a long way, and it is very moisturizing while at the same time not too heavy on the skin. It does seem to improve skin texture and appearance, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, but as far as actually reducing wrinkles -- no. If you&#x27;re looking for a light and effective night moisturizer, this is a good one, but don&#x27;t expect major changes from this product.</li>
    <li> Great product - best price after searching the entire internet!  Look no further.....this product is for you!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, very smooth and seems to work. I do admit that I like another Olay product a bit better even, but this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I find the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum Fragrance Free one of the absolute best face products I have ever used. I love the feel of the cream on my face. It makes my face look softer &amp; brighter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not absorbed very well</li>
    <li> I have used this serum for over a year or more. It goes on smoothly and feel great on the skin. It does work as it says and helps.</li>
    <li> surperise! speedly! good survice, good quality!</li>
    <li> it is OK I guess, for what it is....but really, just raw coconut oil does better for my skin, and it does not bother my eyes the way the Olay does....I have tired it for a couple months, and saw very little difference...so, not really worth the money for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay for over twenty years. I use this serum mixed in with the total effects. The results speak for themselves - I&#x27;m 59 and my skin is very soft and almost wrinkle free. I like the color too - it&#x27;s golden!</li>
    <li> This product is gentle enough to even put it on your eyelids! I am using other products as well, so I don&#x27;t know which ones are doing what, but my skin is looking great!</li>
    <li> Meets all my expectations since this is what I typically buy</li>
    <li> feels like it&#x27;s working alright so far, especially considering just how dry my skin was before starting to use it!</li>
    <li> Have used Olay regenerist serum for 20 years; when I run out I&#x27;ll sometimes try some new, expensive serum--but always come back to Olay.  My skin (dry, mature) likes it and begins to look older when I don&#x27;t use it.  I don&#x27;t know about the &amp;#34;sculpting&amp;#34; part; it will not shrink sagging skin like a laser.  And, I do need a moisturizer over this--it&#x27;s a serum not a moisturizing lotion--but as a serum it has more concentrated peptides so I choose this form.</li>
    <li> Love the smoothly product. I use it with Micro-Sculpting Cream and Timeless Vitamin C serum. The result is great.</li>
    <li> Smooth and light.  Love this!</li>
    <li> Great lightweight moisturizer that makes my skin look and feel great and it does not cause breakouts</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I have used expensive ones but always seem to come back to Olay&#x27;s. I am sticking with this one from now on.  I like that it&#x27;s fragrance free and that the texture is light and easy to apply. It penetrates and keeps my skin smooth and soft. It doesn&#x27;t sit up on your skin like some others do. The Regenerist line works well on my skin and budget.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and break out easily with products that have fragrances. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum Fragrance Free. I use this with Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Night creme Fragrance Free and rarely have a blemish or need to reapply during the day.</li>
    <li> Love this face serum!  Saw definite improvement after a few short months of use.  Love the feel of it on my skin.  It&#x27;s been a mainstay in my skin regimen for years!</li>
    <li> I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED ABOTTLE THAT WAS HALF FULL.  UNFORTUNATLE I DID NOT OPEN &amp; LOOK INSIDE UNTILL A WEEK AFTER I BEGAN USING,  IT WAS ONLY HALF FULL AT THAT TIME AND I USED IT TWICE A DAY FOR 8 DAYS. SOMETHING IS WRONG</li>
    <li> I really like this product, have used it many times and will continue too, best serum I have used so far.</li>
    <li> This product is crap! I put on yesterday and I woke up with a turkey neck! Don&#x27;t buy this crap!</li>
    <li> I have used it for years, but this time I got a great deal and I didn&#x27;t have to go to the store.</li>
    <li> Just the right size and doesn&#x27;t look cheap</li>
    <li> It seems to work fine but it isn&#x27;t life changing.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few years now. It must be doing something right because I get compliments about my over-50 skin frequently.</li>
    <li> This is department store quality or better at a very good price. It feels good on the skin &amp; I love it so much I subscribe to save even more money.</li>
    <li> Ordered my regular Olay products on Amazon b/c of great price and shipping. One of several Olay skin care products that I have used for years.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the master for keeping prices down and service at it&#x27;s best. It&#x27;s worth being a Prime Member even though there was a price increase this year.</li>
    <li> My mother loved this cream!</li>
    <li> I love it!  makes my skin smooth and helps with the wrinkles.  Doesn&#x27;t take but about 5 drops to do my entire face and neck. I have been using this product for about 6 years and love it and would gladly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well.  Feels smooth - no smell.  This is a nice product and I use it at night after I wash my face and in the morning under makeup</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this serum  more than once as it really works...easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfume, isn&#x27;t expensive.  I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I just received my order today. It arrived in great condition, with a long expiration date on the box. GREAT !!  I have used this product for quite a few years.  It actually does firm up your neck and chest area. What I like about this product is it goes into the skin quickly and does not leave a sticky feeling that you tend to get with other firming products. Also, I love the fragrance free formula as I am allergic to many fragrances. Again, you can&#x27;t beat the price in any store.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Fonnie</li>
    <li> You can truly see and feel the result.  It beats all the eye cream I have bought prior, I use it not just the face but around the eyes too.</li>
    <li> one of the best for normal skin......used along with other face creams</li>
    <li> I returned the product after realizing that for health reasons, I would not be able to use. Otherwise, product would have been fine.  Customer Service was wonderful.  Would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I am a 74-year-old male and please don&#x27;&#x27;t laugh at me. I have been take care of my skin since I  was 16. I am obsessed having a clear, glowing skin-tight face and neck so I bought Regenerist M-S Serum. First use at night before bedtime, I have noticed improvement of appearance of my face and neck. It&#x27;s been a week now of using O R M-S Serum and I look much better now way below a 74-year-old looks. Believe it or not, I don&#x27;t have the typical wrinkled  74-yr-old males.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;ll admit I am getting older, but I have never looked it and want to try and never look it.&lt;br /&gt;I started noticing my face showing a little age and well now I don&#x27;t. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Truly a great product for the price.  Excellent for hydrating skin and deminishing the fine lines and helps with wrinkles.......  I use it twice a day!!!!</li>
    <li> Thought I would try this since I always use the serum.  This is a thicker product and goes on nicely.</li>
    <li> I keep an extra bottle of this next to my easy chair so I can rub a little on my chin area throughout the day. I think it&#x27;s helping! It&#x27;s gentle, has no unpleasant scent and it seems to be effective. I&#x27;ll come back after I&#x27;ve used it for a while and give an update.</li>
    <li> I really, really like this serum.  For me, it is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  I know it is not sold as such, but basically, that is what I use it for.  It is so smooth and silky and vanishes almost immediately while leaving your skin soft, smooth and feeling hydrated.  Does it micro-sculpt your face?  I can&#x27;t answer that.  In the long term, I think it probably does do some good on fine lines.  But that&#x27;s not why I buy it or use it regularly.</li>
    <li> So to be fair, I didn&#x27;t use this product very diligently. After about 3 weeks, I sort of gave up after seeing no results. I will continue to use the one I have but will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a LOT of very expensive products (see my other reviews). I think this does a lot for my skin&#x27;s finish and is a small fraction of the price. Happy!</li>
    <li> Fragrance free and no irritation.</li>
    <li> I like that it is fragrance free (my preference). If it is &amp;#34;sculpting&amp;#34; at all it HAS to be on the micro level, because I have not seen any change on the normal level. Perhaps I should ask people to use a microscope when looking at my face? It does feel nice and silky when going on, with no greasy after-feel, that helps it&#x27;s cause... Will I buy more? Not too sure, I don&#x27;t have time for my micros to get sculpted, I need results!!!</li>
    <li> I use this for a light daytime moisturizer.  It is smooth and silky going on, makeup works great over this product.  And it is fragrance free.  Sadly it doesn&#x27;t really sculpt anything, but your skin will look smooth and moist.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin..been using for a year!</li>
    <li> I take care of my skin so if people hear my real age they are stunned. Olay is timeless. This serum goes on like silk and feels so smooth. My skin just drinks it up. Well worth it!</li>
    <li> The item is what I ordered, and was very happy to receive it promptly.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this, it works great!</li>
    <li> Seems to work even better than the regular serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an actress who can&#x27;t get hired to play characters older than 22, and often I play teenagers. I&#x27;m 30. I attribute this to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- genetics/sunscreen/sleep/diet&lt;br /&gt;- this serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has become so even, where it used to be reddish and blotchy. It makes my skin feel tight and even. I use 2-4 pumps daily and one bottle lasts me a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the most important thing is to use it on your face AND neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not found a product as powerful as this one for under $100. I&#x27;m loyal to it! The Subscribe and Save option makes it even more reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re supposed to put the serum on last.  Even so, it makes me break out BAD.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m allergic to it or what but it is definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> This product made my eyes sing even when I avoided my eris. It also scales up and peels of my face. I&#x27;m not buying again. I&#x27;m sure it probably works, but I kept having to re wan my fave after using it to get the built up product off</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product. I am 44 years old and starting to get crows feet... within a couple of weeks of adding this to my nightly routine, I have had comments like &amp;#34;you are looking younger, what are you doing?&amp;#34;  I use it a.m. and p.m. every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you search for this on Amazon, click on the first one that pops up and then search the bottom area for lower prices.</li>
    <li> Got it for my mom. It worked wonders on her complexion. It looks fresh and glowing now more than ever before.</li>
    <li> This review should probably be under a question or more of an observation. I used the micro sculpting cream and found it way to heavy in the summer and want something lighter. Cream was great for the winter. So I am hoping the serum will be the solution.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product together with Olay Regenerist Night Repair Cream for years. I use the serum on my clean face, neck, décolleté and hands every night. The result is NO wrinkles!  Not a one. No more crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes, cheeks are smooth, forehead is unlined, neck is smooth. Best of all, my décolleté is smooth &amp; youthful!  When I have to give my age (the end of my sixth decade), people don&#x27;t believe me.  Thanks to mom for my good genetics.  Thanks to Olay for amazing products that work!</li>
    <li> Always have a successful Outcome!</li>
    <li> I researched my old Serum to find the closest match.  I discovered that Olay purchased that company and the Regenerist formula is very close.  At one time, my old product was much more affordable on Amazon and other websites, but I think Olay must have implemented some form of price or franchise protection so I can&#x27;t find it under $85 for a small bottle anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was worth the research.  I still wish I could go back to DDF but it is just hard to justify when this does the trick.</li>
    <li> No kidding. I&#x27;ve used expensive moisture creams just until this first purchase and only because my other was not in stock. So, I am as surprised as anyone that I really can see a difference I never saw before with the other expensive and brands. PS: Olay fragrance free is my choice since my skin is very sensitive to facial products. Was hoping it would be hypoallergenic for me...as so it is&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Really didnt notice a change and has a very slight gasoline odor of some sort.....however the serum is moisterizing and absorbs nicely into the skin</li>
    <li> Was a gift.  They just like it.</li>
    <li> Works well absorbs, quickly and creates a nice makeup base, however it irritates my skin if used daily. It worked but I&#x27;ve decided to move toward more natural products and my skin is loving it. Would I buy this again? Maybe in a pinch but not likely.</li>
    <li> Really good fragrance free moisturizer. Feels good on skin.</li>
    <li> This is another product that I have used for some time and is so much more reasonable on Amazon.  Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I like this but as far as important in my skin.  Not what it claims to be maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> The product was pictured and advertised as fragrance free; it says so on the bottle in the picture.  The item I received was NOT the fragrance free version, and since I was in a hurry, I had it on my face before I realized.  Spent the next 20 minutes trying to remove all traces of a very persistent perfume, was late, and very annoyed.  I&#x27;m sure the product is fine, but it was NOT what I ordered.  For those of us who have skin sensitive to fragrances, the FRAGRANCE FREE part matters.  Those who don&#x27;t have the problem often don&#x27;t see why there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
    <li> I use and keep hoping it works great.  you just never do know do you?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and really don&#x27;t want to do without it.  I notice a difference in my skin texture and lighter wrinkles...after all...nothing will really take the wrinkles away forever.  Try it for several weeks before you judge the product.</li>
    <li> Love it - smooth feeling, not greasy - skin feels wonderful - I see results already after only a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb.....!I love it and replace it as soon as I get low.  I use this everyday, twice a day..  My skin soaks it up and feels sooooo good.  It is not greasy and has no perfume.  I don&#x27;t need an eye creme with this.</li>
    <li> Excellent as expected.</li>
    <li> Really fabulous product to put under your moisturizer and after your toner. I love it.</li>
    <li> I use 2-3 pumps of this lotion on my face every morning after I shower, and it perfectly hydrates and soaks in without being heavy. Perfect under my makeup and works all day. I notice that breakouts seem to keep to a minimum or non-existant when I&#x27;m using this every day, and as soon as I&#x27;m out I re-purchase the exact same thing. I small bottle lasts about 3-4 weeks I think. Because it effectlively works, I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the price, and way less than dept store brands.</li>
    <li> Helps my skin immensly</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying this product and was very upset with the results.  After two days of using the product my face turned bright red and burned.  I have stopped using the product and after a few weeks still am dealing with a red face.  I feel there should be a warning on the package stating individuals with sensitive skin should not use this product.  Buyer beware - good for some and not so for others.</li>
    <li> This is something I have used before. I first bought as recommended on Beautipedia. I am 60 and use this in the winter when my combination skin is a little more dry. It is the one I use when I feel my skin needs a rest from stronger serums which I use more often. Sometimes my skin gets sensitive but this will still give my skin some treatment and helps to heal drying patches. It does not give my skin the improvement that vitamin c and Retinol products do long term. It does have a chemical smell which makes me concerned about what I am putting on my face but it is fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product from Olay and has used this for approx over 2 yrs. Uses this product devotely for moisturized face all day and non-greasy feeling. This item is priced higher at the retail stores.  She ask me to find this item on Amazon and located found it from this vendor for a great price lower than any retail stores in the market and saved her approx 25% on this item. Wife now have this on a auto subscription repurchase every 6 months from this vendor and you can&#x27;t beat the price at all. Highly recommend for purchase and for subscription for ladies who uses this product.</li>
    <li> Always the best &amp; fragrance free! :)</li>
    <li> I am a regular Oil of Olay customer, I like most of their products anyway, I should have an automatic bi monthly shipment so I would never run out.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Regenerist line for several years now and really find that it&#x27;s very effective.  I have never seen the product in &amp;#34;fragrance free,&amp;#34; so I was happy to try it out.  Unfortunately, the product that was shipped to me was not &amp;#34;fragrance free,&amp;#34; which was frustrating.</li>
    <li> Fantastic.  I haven&#x27;t used anything other than Olay products for years.  I am 70 years old, being a one-time redhead with light and very dry skin, I use the Micro-Sculpting serum and the Micro-Sculpting moisturizing cream. The serum and cream do not remove the wrinkles but I certainly see a vast difference in my skin.  Although the wrinkles are still visible, my skin has taken on a clearer, smoother complexion especially around the eye area.  I don&#x27;t know if I look younger, but at my age who could ask for more than lovely skin.</li>
    <li> I fully endorse this product. I have used it for a few years and I have visibly seen a difference in my face. I use it under Olay Regenerist Lotion SPF 15 by day and and under Olay Regenerist  Night Recovery Cream at night. It is worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> At the right price, delivered promptly ... What else do you want...&lt;br /&gt;Does it work, give me a few weeks to observe the results... But in her case there is not much in need of improvement!</li>
    <li> Discovered this product after watching a very good series of skin care and make-up tips for...ahem...mature skin on YouTube.  I love it! I am already on my second bottle. It is reasonably priced, makes skin feel amazing - just nice and soft, not greasy. I am prone to small whitehead-like breakouts on my chin and forehead - I believe they are called milia -  and this does not make that problem any worse, unlike many serums. I use this in conjunction with Retin A every other night, and a glycolic acid lotion on the other nights. Very happy with the results, just one month in. (The great skincare &amp; makeup videos are by Hot &amp; Flashy.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so tired of paying $70+ on serums and lotions.  So I thought I would give this a try.  Seems good</li>
    <li> I have use Olay products since I was 20yrs old and now I am 60 and will continue to use their products. I love Regenerist Micro-Sculpting serum...I have been using this for one month now..see some improvement in skin texture and I know with continual use I will notice more improvements....I hope...Thank you Olay for Frangrance Free..I have very sensitive skin....</li>
    <li> love the product, but the pump was broken. would buy at target instead.</li>
    <li> First, let me tell you I have very dry, sensitive skin ever since menopause and chemotherapy treatment.  That being said, this works well for exfoliating the skin and making it a bit smoother.  I cannot use a lot of products because of the sensitivity and dryness, but I can use this, however, not everyday, usually every other.  The consistency of this is very smooth and it does absorb well.  I usually wait a couple of minutes before putting on my moisturizer to let it sink in.</li>
    <li> Veery smooth cream and we see result  quickly</li>
    <li> It does make my skin felt smoother and plumper when touched.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as new and it was almost empty.  It was obviously used 3/4 of it was gone.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years.  Best product ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once since I received it yesterday. But I didn&#x27;t see anything on the bottle about it being fragrance free. Instead there was a paper sticker with a bar code (probably from Amazon) that said &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;. However, when I applied the serum to my face it definitely had a scent. It smells good but my skin is sensitive and I&#x27;m unsure if this will be beneficial for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this. After doing research on Paula&#x27;s Choice website, I decided to use this and the other Regenerist products. They&#x27;ve been great for my skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice going on and leaves a very smooth finish. Good for fine lines. Does not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin soft and smooth.  I use this product under Regenerist Micro-Sculpting  cream.  This is a good combination.n</li>
    <li> So far I love it....first time i have tried the micro-sculpting...it has only been a few weeks.  I will purchase again</li>
    <li> This is my first time to try this product.  Does it ever deliver!  I am in my 60&#x27;s and I noticed the difference in my skin after only a few uses.  I use the Oil of Olay total effect over it for a moisturizer.  I used another, much pricier product before and this product is just as good, maybe even better.  I like getting it from Amazon because the price is good and it arrives quickly.  I will re-order this when I get low.</li>
    <li> Olay is the only serum I have used for some time and do not plan on changing!</li>
    <li> This works quite well for me, not greasy, but quite hydrating.  I would prefer that they drop the parabens and other possibly dangerous preservatives........maybe they will start an organic line someday.</li>
    <li> One of the best.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve committed to a subscription for a product - I love this serum THAT much. I won&#x27;t promise you a miraculous disappearance of wrinkles (hey, I&#x27;ve only been using it for about six weeks anyway) but your skin will be brighter, smoother, and healthier-looking. My husband looked at me the other day and said, &amp;#34;Why do you look so flushed?&amp;#34; This was a positive thing, as I&#x27;m generally very pale, verging on pasty. The serum has given my skin a nice glow. I love how it applies; it is silky, sinks in fast, and leaves a velvety feel. My skin can&#x27;t handle moisturizers- just too much for it - so this is all I need. Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve never bought any type of face product through amazon but I read some good things about this serum and was out so I decided to try it. I have very sensitive skin and I absolutely love the way this makes my skin feel. I also noticed that it really helped my dark spots and evened out my skin tone. I LOVE this product and will be buying again. Definitely recommend the product and the seller. It came super quick and isn&#x27;t a bad price :)</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of the Olay Regen Micro Sculpting Serum and I love it.  I actually have a regimen that i do every morning after I wash my face.  I add some of this serum, then I add my moisturizer then finally I add my Olay SPF 15 cream.  I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my skin.  I&#x27;m 43 years old and my esthetician commented that my skin was very youthful.  I think this serum has been extremely helpful in the small fine lines I have around my eyes and my forehead.  The elasticity in my skin has really gotten much tighter.  I would highly recommend trying this out and sticking with it to see results.  Consistency is the key!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t change anything or brighten my face. The other creams I use are as good.I wanted to try it and I willuse it up but not buy more.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  Will continue to use it.  Feels smooth on the face and my skin is looking better every day.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feel so soft.  I use it morning and night.  It is the first step in my skin care routine after I wash my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using it every day and every night, and its nice on my skin, not oily, and its very light, I just don&#x27;t see any sort of results from it.  I might stick to it just because I have sensitive skin and its non irritating, but its not really knocking my socks off performance wise.</li>
    <li> Buen aparato y justamente lo que me esperaba, los vendedores son muy responsables y la entrega se ejecutó un poco tarde de lo estimado.</li>
    <li> I always use this serum with my Olay Regenerist moisturizer.  Both of these products come in fragrance free which is what I need.  The Olay Regenersist Night Cream is also great. I buy all of these products at Amazon as the price is much better than my local stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product faithfully for about 5 months and I can honestly say I have noticed a difference. I appreciate the fragrance free aspect.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I have been using Olay since I was 14 and Olay always delivers the best quality products. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and 3 kids later I am still receiving compliment regarding my youthful appearance and even skin tone (even with the harsh Australian sun). I have only love for this company!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this works on its own, but I use it in combo with Vit C serum and Paula&#x27;s Choice AHA.  I haven&#x27;t noticed improvement after about 6 weeks, but I admit I am still getting into a stringent routine.  I have not noticed any new lines, but I feel like I am combating sagging more!</li>
    <li> Rated very highly by other reviewers so I use it....I use so many things not sure if this is really working but will continue until I find something rated better for the same price</li>
    <li> Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum is nice and sheer.  It glides on your face.  Moisturizes and protects you skin leaving it silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> Shipped me a cheap Asian knockoff - not the real thing - not as shown - Asian writing all over the package &amp; ingredients are different.</li>
    <li> Having just noticed the very first lines to appear on my face, I did some research on reasonably-priced skincare solutions to address them, pronto. The Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum got good reviews, and I like that it&#x27;s fragrance-free. After only a few days using this serum, it&#x27;s so far delivering on its promises of a firmer, more radiant complexion. I&#x27;ve only just begun to get some lines on the sides of my cheeks, and using this serum twice daily for the past few days has resulted in a smoother, more plumped appearance, which has diminished the visibility of those lines. And with its amino-peptides and firming complex, I know it&#x27;s doing more than just making the lines APPEAR reduced. The results should be even more impressive over time. Exfoliating increases the beneficial results, so I also just started using the Regenerist Microdermabrasion &amp; Peel System once a week. I find it a bit too harsh to use more often, so I supplement my exfoliating routine by using the Olay Pro-X facial brush 2-3 times a week. So far, the whole regimen seems to be working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this serum is much thicker and heavier than any serum I&#x27;ve used in the past. Most serums are very lightweight and require only a couple of pearl-sized drops, which are easy to spread thinly over the face, and absorb quickly. But this serum has a consistency and texture more like a lightweight moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t glide on as thinly as more liquid serums, which means I&#x27;m using more than I anticipated, so I don&#x27;t expect a bottle to last very long. But what&#x27;s important is that the results are good, so I guess I&#x27;ll just be buying it more often, and in the future through Amazon, as I paid much more for it at my local CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long, I&#x27;ve tried the serum with impressive results in conjunction with the Micro-Sculpting moisturizer for night, and Olay Total Effects (which is now available in SPF 30, which is great -- it used to be offeredin only 15 SPF) for day. Both have worked very well, but when I tried the serum last night followed with Neutrogena&#x27;s \\&quot;Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle Moisture\\&quot; (a fairly lightweight formula), I woke up this morning with dry-looking skin. So for me, at least, an entirely Olay regimen seems to work best. The results are so good that even when I&#x27;m very tired in the evening, I&#x27;m no longer tempted to take the lazy way out and skip my night-time skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I grudgingly tried this after Olay reportedly took the parabens out of their fragrance-free  Regenerist Regenerating Serum (which I loved) but replaced them with a formaldehyde-releasing substance.  I am allergic to formaldehyde and didn&#x27;t want to chance it.  I find this a little too much for the oilier areas of my face, but--drum roll--best and cheapest eye serum I have ever used!  I use a vitamin C and E serum, then this, nightly.  Great results, particularly since I am too cheap to buy a tiny but expensive \\&quot;eye\\&quot; serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight lately, and the last time I was this size, I was young.  Now, in my early 50&#x27;s, I find my weight loss has left me with sagging skin under my chin (down my neck), and I&#x27;ve lost a lot of vibrancy in my skin tone on my face.  The texture of my skin was pretty rough, too.  After using this product for three months, I&#x27;ve found my skin brighter, tighter and it has a better tone.  Some of my wrinkles have decreased in depth and size.  I still have the bands of skin on my neck, however, but I&#x27;m happy with my results, anyway.  I prefer the fragrance free, but I have used the serum with fragrance, and it isn&#x27;t bad at all.  I have very oily skin, and this product provides enough moisturizing without causing breakouts.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It makes your skin feel nice, but I don&#x27;t see any results as far as lines on your face.</li>
    <li> Great serum for your money..all skin types..if dry or very dry you will need a moisturizer over it. Smooth, glides on and leaves a healthy looking glow. Not too much glow, just enough! Wow! Plenty of good vitamins and antioxidants for your skin.</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for my mother</li>
    <li> Been using this product for several&lt;br /&gt;Years, it&#x27;s the best one I tried &amp; will continue to buy it &amp; no other</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome! I</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years, along with the Regenerist moisturizer.  I sometimes wonder if it&#x27;s doing anything extra and I quit using it, only to go back to it because I can see a difference in the tightness of my skin when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Love the pump design.</li>
    <li> Perfect amount of moisture for my face. Not to heavy.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.</li>
    <li> It works! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife at Christmas. Excellent price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> It is working great as usual. It makes my skin silky smooth. The deep forehead wrinkles are still there, but less noticeable. I was a sun worshiper when I was younger, so for the young ladies, be sure to wear shades &amp; a hat when out in the sun.</li>
    <li> After only days I see a significant change, my skin is tighter and brighter, and also smooth, I am totally amazed! No more exspensive department store creams for me!</li>
    <li> Results are not very noticeable.</li>
    <li> This feels great on the skin and absorbs quickly and delivers clarity to the skin.  I am a big fan of Olay products.  This is another great skin care product that will give you results at half the cost of high end brands.</li>
    <li> I like what it&#x27;s doing to my complexion. I wear it twice a day, under foundation and at bedtime. Leaves my face soft but not greasy which is a win-win for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Olay Regenerist line for 8 years now and I love it. I have received many compliments about my complexion.</li>
    <li> Was working good reducing some wrinkle lines. But gotta keep using of course. That&#x27;s my downfall. Not greasy. Unique feel to it.</li>
    <li> This helps with my post breakout hyperpigmentation. I like that is fragrance-free and my oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin doesn&#x27;t react badly to this serum.</li>
    <li> Am 67 and have been using Oil of Olay products since my early 20s, adjusting products based on aging. Last Thanksgiving a friend&#x27;s twin, who visits fairly often from Hawaii, discovered my age and was totally shocked. He thought I was the same age as he and his twin, who are 51!  Also have lost the brown marks from sun damage since using the serum then the cream twice daily. I had a large, dark brown mark on my left cheek from driving over 100 miles a day in my job with the sun frequently shining in my window, and it&#x27;s now nearly invisible. Am I pleased with Oil of Olay products? Oh yeah!</li>
