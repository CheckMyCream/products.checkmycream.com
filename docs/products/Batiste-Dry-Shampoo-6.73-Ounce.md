      <li>I love this product, the blond spray is wonderful.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good product and delivers what it promises.</li>
      <li>but it did not look good when I finished.  </li>
      <li>My hair and scalp loved it.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO AMAZING</li>
      <li>You have to shake it really good and make sure you aren&#x27;t too close.</li>
      <li>Batiste dry shampoo smells wonderful and makes my hair look great.</li>
      <li>I love, love it!</li>
      <li>but this has a pleasant smell and it really works!!!</li>
      <li>Was exactly as described and works great.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>My hair is very manageable and great looking after using it.  </li>
      <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I should have believed it :)</li>
      <li>This is a great product, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>This one is magical.  </li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo ever!</li>
      <li>but I love the light blond.</li>
      <li>I still use it, I just have to clean a bit more often.</li>
      <li>but I was worried that if I wore a light color it would</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten better at it the more times I use it, and that isn&#x27;t much of an issue any longer.</li>
      <li>My hair feels and looks fresh and clean!</li>
      <li>So I was excited to hear about Batiste&#x27;s hair-matching line.</li>
      <li>perfect for when your too lazy to go to a beauty salon for your fiance.</li>
      <li>I use even if my hair is clean just for the texture, color and volume it adds.</li>
      <li>like bright red.</li>
      <li>This is the first kind of dry shampoo that I have really liked.</li>
      <li>Fantastic scent, easy to use, and works really well.</li>
      <li>; So apparently the combination of the oil-drying and the red tint on top of my already electric red hair resulted in me accidentally becoming the most beautiful person in the universe.  </li>
      <li>Quick background:  </li>
      <li>the color looks clownishly red to me, more of an orange-y color red and if that&#x27;s what the desired color is, that&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>You heard it here first!</li>
      <li>I was very happy to find a dry shampoo that blends in with my red hair instead of making it look like I have dandruff.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s actually a great product to use when your roots are showing and you need to color your hair again because it completely covers your roots with the red color.</li>
      <li>This stuff is very comparable to bumble and bumble and 1/3 of the price!</li>
      <li>I found that this product needs to be rubbed in pretty vigorously before brushing through.</li>
      <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering a set of the brown here pretty soon.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo on the market hands down!</li>
      <li>I suppose it&#x27;s possible someone out there has this hair color naturally, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for redheads on the orangey warm end of the spectrum.</li>
      <li>Most of the time I can&#x27;t stand the smell of dry shampoo</li>
      <li>I love this brand of Dry Shampoo</li>
      <li>use the regular Batiste dry shampoo (which has an even more fabulous fragrance) until my roots start to show between touch ups.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Vibrant Red in this line is certainly vibrant---wet out of the can, it goes on very bright dark orangey-red; it&#x27;s still more orange than red when it&#x27;s rubbed in and dry.</li>
      <li>It got rid of all of the oiliness in my hair and added volume, making my hair look very refreshed.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>This has a VERY orange tint...</li>
      <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Rubbed off on everything and didn&#x27;t blend very well.</li>
      <li>but I expected it to be more of a true red.</li>
      <li>I have red hair and this blends right in!</li>
      <li>If you have a darker auburn hair this shade would be to vibrant for you.</li>
      <li>I have vivid red hair, and as those with bright red hair know, every shower looks like a crime scene as red always tends to wash out and</li>
      <li>It did a fine job of absorbing oil, but stained my hairbrush red when I brushed it out.</li>
      <li>From my experience, it has the same great quality as all of the other varieties of their dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>It went away after I washed my hair, of course, but it did look kind of odd for my scalp to be red.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right folks, Batiste dry shampoo in vibrant red will turn your into a super model whether you like it or not.  </li>
      <li>Its a vibrant fashion shade of red, exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I put it in my hair on a particularly skanky day and people all throughout the day were like WOW</li>
      <li>The dry shampoo not only works to make my hair look more clean, it also camouflages my dark roots</li>
      <li>I have dark red hair, and this dry shampoo color came out like a true redhead&#x27;s color (more of a gingery orange).  </li>
      <li>I really like the vibrant &amp; Red.</li>
      <li>But when it arrived and I tried it, it came out as a bright, cool, blue-based red that looked completely artificial.</li>
      <li>Well, the name doesn&#x27;t lie, it is very vibrant and very red.</li>
      <li>so I thought I would try the Red tint because I am a red head, but it&#x27;s a little too bright red.  </li>
      <li>I would call my hair color a natural looking auburn.</li>
      <li>I only wash my hair once or twice a week so this really matte&#x27;s and takes the shine at the root away.</li>
      <li>Definitely would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
      <li>each is still half full.</li>
      <li>Batiste&#x27;s Vibrant Red is not a perfect color match for me, but in a pinch it&#x27;s good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Batiste&#x27;s dry shampoo and since I recently colored my hair red</li>
      <li>My daughter absolutely loves Batiste Dry Shampoo in Vibrant Red.</li>
      <li>The red color matched quite well with the red color of my hair (which is more of a natural, dark red).</li>
      <li>I have Ariel red hair and the Red that I ordered had a bit of an orange tint to it, but after I brush it out you can&#x27;t really</li>
      <li>Nice smell, good dry shampoo, leaves re crap everywhere!  </li>
      <li>The Vibrant Red color makes her hair look fiery red.</li>
      <li>Disappointed, I was really hoping for a good match.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try their Vibrant &amp; Red dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>As an admitted &amp;#34;salon redhead&amp;#34; with naturally dark hair, my roots are really showing up by the time I see my colorist every six weeks.</li>
      <li>So I suppose if you have RED RED hair this might work for you, but not if its a natural red shade.</li>
      <li>Dry shampoo is a life saver for those busy days where you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
      <li>Because my hair is a copper red color, the ordinary &amp;#34;uncolored&amp;#34; dry shampoos can make my hair look dusty or chalky, but the &amp;#34;Vibrant Red&amp;#34; blends beautifully into my hair color (and even helps hide my roots if I have gone too long between coloring).</li>
      <li>and this dry shampoo is FAR too red.</li>

<li> I used to keep the Bumble dry red shampoo on hand as an emergency root cover-up, and went to this product when that was discontinued.</li>
<li> I use dry shampoo all the time, but the stuff I find at drugstores makes my naturally strawberry blonde and copper hair look dusty, even after I really work it into my scalp.</li>
<li> I really only use this on my root area, on that last week before I get my salon touch-up, and even then only if I have an occasion where my dark roots would be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Despite the scalp issue, I will definitely continue using this product and other Batiste dry</li>
<li> The dry shampoo element is not enriching and the color got all over my clothing.</li>
<li> The smell wasn&#x27;t objectionable, but I prefer the fresher scent of the Pantene dry shampoo</li>
<li> The red hue was great for a bit, however it got everywhere and the spray smelled terrible.</li>
<li> Since B&amp;B discontinued their red, I have had a hard time finding a dry shampoo that had red in it/ worked well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for. I had only tried one dry shampoo before this and hated the white stiff effect it had on my hair. This helps my red shine through and it simply refreshens and soaks up the oil without affect anything else. I don&#x27;t like a lot of product in my hair so this is perfect for me because I can&#x27;t feel anything when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> This is quite red for my auburn hair. Otherwise it works as expected.</li>
    <li> Dry shampoo is a life saver for those busy days where you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair. Batiste dry shampoo smells wonderful and makes my hair look great.

I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> this comes out Bozo the clown RED</li>
    <li> This stuff works surprisingly VERY well, although I ordered the wrong shade of red.  I have Ariel red hair and the Red that I ordered had a bit of an orange tint to it, but after I brush it out you can&#x27;t really tell.&lt;br /&gt;I only wash my hair once a week so this stuff works miracles.  :)  I&#x27;ll be ordering a set of the brown here pretty soon.</li>
    <li> The red hue was great for a bit, however it got everywhere and the spray smelled terrible. It went into the garbage.</li>
    <li> perfect for when your too lazy to go to a beauty salon for your fiance.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this product. I use dry shampoo all the time, but the stuff I find at drugstores makes my naturally strawberry blonde and copper hair look dusty, even after I really work it into my scalp. So I was excited to hear about Batiste&#x27;s hair-matching line. But when it arrived and I tried it, it came out as a bright, cool, blue-based red that looked completely artificial. As in clown wig red! I suppose it&#x27;s possible someone out there has this hair color naturally, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for redheads on the orangey warm end of the spectrum. I have a cousin who colors her hair a burgundy red shade, and I bet this would work for her and others with a similar color.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I was expecting. Rubbed off on everything and didn&#x27;t blend very well. Used it once, will never use it again.</li>
    <li> Quick background:  Just two months ago I started dying my hair (naturally dark brown hair with emerging grey/white hairs), and I am now a crazy redhead.  Because I color, I try to actually wash my hair only 1-2 times per week.  I have dark red hair, and this dry shampoo color came out like a true redhead&#x27;s color (more of a gingery orange).  No worries, though I just flip my head over and worked it into the roots of my scalp and I flip back up and instant improvement.  After four days of not washing my hair, my scalp is greasy as heck but this fixes it, I will always buy this.  I would recommend this color to any redhead.</li>
    <li> So I pretty much figured that all dry shampoos are created equal, but apparently I was WRONG.  This one is magical.  Like....  I put it in my hair on a particularly skanky day and people all throughout the day were like WOW YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO AMAZING TODAY WHAT&#x27;S DIFFERENT?!?!  And I was like &amp;#34;....I haven&#x27;t showered in like four days....?&amp;#34; So apparently the combination of the oil-drying and the red tint on top of my already electric red hair resulted in me accidentally becoming the most beautiful person in the universe.  That&#x27;s right folks, Batiste dry shampoo in vibrant red will turn your into a super model whether you like it or not.  You heard it here first!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! Makes it possible for me to go a day or two without washing my hair. My only issue is the red residue. You have to shake it really good and make sure you aren&#x27;t too close. Also that you rub it in well at the scalp. If not, it will leave your scalp red, forehead red (if you get any there), and clothes red. I&#x27;ve gotten better at it the more times I use it, and that isn&#x27;t much of an issue any longer. My hair feels and looks fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t get on my clothes or anything terrible but I was worried that if I wore a light color it would so I stopped using. When I washed my hair red came out</li>
    <li> This has a VERY orange tint... I NEEDED RED.. Not orange.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of Dry Shampoo so I thought I would try the Red tint because I am a red head, but it&#x27;s a little too bright red.  If your not carful it will look like you dusted your hair in cherry flavored flour.  The Blonde/yellow can works well with red hair too.</li>
    <li> I love this product, the blond spray is wonderful. I have blond hair however it is dishwater colored so when I spray this on it looks like I have instant highlights and adds texture and volume. I use even if my hair is clean just for the texture, color and volume it adds. I have not tried any of the others but I love the light blond.</li>
    <li> My hair is somewhere auburn and strawberry blonde (is that just REGULR red??) and this dry shampoo is FAR too red. It looks like spray pain in my hair the same color red as the darker color on the can.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! The red tint gets on my bathroom surfaces if I do a heavy application though, so it&#x27;s a bit messy. I still use it, I just have to clean a bit more often.</li>
    <li> Color was Bozo the Clown red</li>
    <li> Definitely would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Works great!  I was very happy to find a dry shampoo that blends in with my red hair instead of making it look like I have dandruff. My hair is very manageable and great looking after using it.  My only problem is that the shampoo leaves traces where every my head may come to rest till I wash it out.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves Batiste Dry Shampoo in Vibrant Red. As a redhead, the other Batiste products made her hair look dull. The Vibrant Red color makes her hair look fiery red. It is a staple.</li>
    <li> It got rid of the oil problem, but it left my hair feeling a bit dry and stiff.  Overall it&#x27;s a good product and delivers what it promises.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, good dry shampoo, leaves re crap everywhere!  On your neck on your clothes all over your bathroom etc.</li>
    <li> This is RED. like bright red. Not good for dark red, colored hair. GO for the brunette color if so.</li>
    <li> The red shampoo is awful!  It is a terrible color that does not blend and it will dye your scalp. When trying to get this out of my hair, it got all over my body, the tub and it even turned the bath water orange. DO NOT BUY...stick with the regular Batiste dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> As an admitted &amp;#34;salon redhead&amp;#34; with naturally dark hair, my roots are really showing up by the time I see my colorist every six weeks. I used to keep the Bumble dry red shampoo on hand as an emergency root cover-up, and went to this product when that was discontinued. Batiste&#x27;s Vibrant Red is not a perfect color match for me, but in a pinch it&#x27;s good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vibrant Red in this line is certainly vibrant---wet out of the can, it goes on very bright dark orangey-red; it&#x27;s still more orange than red when it&#x27;s rubbed in and dry. Unless you happen to have hair exactly this shade (highly doubtful!), it would be ill-advised to spray this all over your head. I really only use this on my root area, on that last week before I get my salon touch-up, and even then only if I have an occasion where my dark roots would be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a powdery finish like other dry shampoos, so don&#x27;t overspray or you will end up with a weird orange chalky look. I found that this product needs to be rubbed in pretty vigorously before brushing through. The smell wasn&#x27;t objectionable, but I prefer the fresher scent of the Pantene dry shampoo I also keep on hand for all-over use.</li>
    <li> I do not like this.  It was not consistent and perhaps I am not doing it correctly but it did not look good when I finished.  I ended up taking a shower and rinsing it out.</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent, easy to use, and works really well. I have vivid red hair, and as those with bright red hair know, every shower looks like a crime scene as red always tends to wash out and the overall color fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the regular Batiste dry shampoo (which has an even more fabulous fragrance) until my roots start to show between touch ups. Then, it&#x27;s onto this stuff. The dry shampoo not only works to make my hair look more clean, it also camouflages my dark roots really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 bottles which have lasted me for the last 6 months and each is still half full. This is a great product, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I really like the vibrant &amp; Red. This is the first kind of dry shampoo that I have really liked. Most of the time I can&#x27;t stand the smell of dry shampoo but this has a pleasant smell and it really works!!!</li>
    <li> Usually dry shampoos make your roots a bit white.... I have red hair and this blends right in! I even get complements when I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in 3 days.  Gives body with a hit of color. I love, love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Batiste&#x27;s dry shampoo and since I recently colored my hair red I wanted to try their Vibrant &amp; Red dry shampoo. From my experience, it has the same great quality as all of the other varieties of their dry shampoo. It got rid of all of the oiliness in my hair and added volume, making my hair look very refreshed. The red color matched quite well with the red color of my hair (which is more of a natural, dark red). And it&#x27;s actually a great product to use when your roots are showing and you need to color your hair again because it completely covers your roots with the red color. My only issue with this product is that the red color stayed on my scalp. It went away after I washed my hair, of course, but it did look kind of odd for my scalp to be red. Despite the scalp issue, I will definitely continue using this product and other Batiste dry shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall....&lt;br /&gt;Pros: refreshes hair, gets rid of oiliness, adds some volume, matched the shade of my hair well, red color covers roots&lt;br /&gt;Con(s): Makes your scalp red</li>
    <li> the color looks clownishly red to me, more of an orange-y color red and if that&#x27;s what the desired color is, that&#x27;s great but I expected it to be more of a true red.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! My hair and scalp loved it.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo on the market hands down!</li>
    <li> Well, the name doesn&#x27;t lie, it is very vibrant and very red. I have red hair by means of red hair dye, so I figured a dry shampoo for red hair would probably be a close enough match. I&#x27;ve used Batiste&#x27;s medium brown, and its worked well, but I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It is REALLY RED. Like, unnaturally red. I would call my hair color a natural looking auburn. So I suppose if you have RED RED hair this might work for you, but not if its a natural red shade. It did a fine job of absorbing oil, but stained my hairbrush red when I brushed it out. Disappointed, I was really hoping for a good match. The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it lower is that the name of the color is indicative of the product. I should have believed it :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is very comparable to bumble and bumble and 1/3 of the price! Since B&amp;B discontinued their red, I have had a hard time finding a dry shampoo that had red in it/ worked well. I am hair stylist and got a tip to try this shampoo from another stylist and I LOVE IT. I only wash my hair once or twice a week so this really matte&#x27;s and takes the shine at the root away. Its a vibrant fashion shade of red, exactly what I needed. If you have a darker auburn hair this shade would be to vibrant for you.</li>
    <li> This is basically red hair spray. The dry shampoo element is not enriching and the color got all over my clothing.</li>
    <li> Was exactly as described and works great.</li>
