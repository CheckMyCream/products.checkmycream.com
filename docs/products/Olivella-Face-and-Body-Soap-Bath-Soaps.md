      <li>My strong recommendation-to make sure I keep using Olivella &amp;#34;always&amp;#34;: A 64 ounce REFILL PACKAGE SIZE OF OLIVELLA LIQUID SOAP.  </li>
      <li>This seller vacuum packs the product, which I&#x27;ve found to be ideal and prevents leaks.</li>

      <li>The fragrance is light and we definitely have noticed a change in our skin since we began using it.  </li>
      <li>is exceptionally fast.</li>
      <li>But it was a huge soapy mess to clean up.....</li>
      <li>This product is definitely worth the extra money (about twice what a large bottle of Ivory hand soap</li>
      <li>and I would get large red blotches on my wrists.</li>
      <li>My skin feels really soft after I use it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought six 16.9 bottles so far (I use about one a week) and each order has arrived from Amazon in one day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I couldn&#x27;t used. Merchandise came poor packcaged. It was all spill over the package</li>
    <li> We love this soap.  It smells great.  We use it in the kitchen, bathing the kids and in the bathrooms.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product...leaves my skin soft and a very pleasant smell.  I even use this in guest rooms, everyone wants to know where to get the product.  Before Amazon, I bought at a local store, then , they started only selling the dishwasher soap!  This is a great buy and delivery is exceptionally fast.</li>
    <li> I will give a 5 star had it not for the brittle container THAT EASILY broke on day 3 &amp; I lost 1/2 the volume.....cracked open!</li>
    <li> I love OLIVELLA.  The skin on my hands has NEVER_EVER_ felt so silky smooth with no use of &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; moisturizers etc. The _ONLY_ &amp;#34;quibble&amp;#34; I have is with the &amp;#34;too much plastic&amp;#34; in the packaging-nothing to do with Olivella as a product or as  THE BEST EVER LIQUID SOAP FOR SENSITIVE SKIN.  My strong recommendation-to make sure I keep using Olivella &amp;#34;always&amp;#34;: A 64 ounce REFILL PACKAGE SIZE OF OLIVELLA LIQUID SOAP.  If you do that I will be an Olivella Customer FOREVER and for ALWAYS.  Promise!</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for a couple of years now  and I love it. I use it as a hand soap, but I have friends that use it as a face soap. I love the smell too.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this product and I am in love!  I no longer can consider using any other product for my body and face for cleansing!  I love the clean smell and the refreshing send of being moisturized!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it BUT this was the first time It came from you ,I&#x27;ve always ordered from Vermont country store and will in the future.....the box was crushed on one end the bottles were not broken but both tops had popped off.  The box,DVD in the box and my mail box were soaked with soap.  The DVD  was wrapped in plastic and there was about 3/4 of each bottle left. But it was a huge soapy mess to clean up.....my mailbox still and will always smell of soap....luckily  it has a nice smell.....this is the second and last time I&#x27;m telling you this</li>
    <li> I love the feel of the soap and it makes my body and hands feel so soft.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I like this face and body soap. This is the 7th bottle I have ordered.  I use it in my soap dispensers for my bathrooms. I would recommend it to anyone especially if you like olive oil.</li>
    <li> Olivella products smell absolutely divine!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shower gel that my husband and I both could use instead of buying a product marketed for men for him and another for myself. This product is perfect for both of us. It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling tight or dry and does NOT have a strong odor at all that I noticed some other reviews mention. It has a very mild clean smell that does not linger. We both like it very much and I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Very good hand wash - have used for years</li>
    <li> In past years my hands and wrists used to get so dry during Winter that the skin on my fingers would crack and I would get large red blotches on my wrists.

    <li> I love this soap!!!!  Ordered many times!!!</li>
    <li> Great item, awesome prices , super shipper</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I LOVE this product.  The fragrance is light and we definitely have noticed a change in our skin since we began using it.  Our skin is less dry an softer, but without a greasy feel.  Just clean and soft.  I mostly use this as a body wash.  My husband uses it on his face in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered the product before from another seller on Amazon and unfortunately, the product leaked out prior to delivery.  That was dissappointing, but Amazon issued a refund.  This seller vacuum packs the product, which I&#x27;ve found to be ideal and prevents leaks.</li>
    <li> A continued favourite.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It feels great.  It smells great.  My skin feels really soft after I use it.</li>
    <li> I discovered this soap a while ago and now my husband is using it too. We both use it daily for out hand washing but I have started using on my face and it is very gentle.  We love this stuff and it is exactly as described on the website.</li>
    <li> love this product cleans well and leaves skin soft not oily.</li>
