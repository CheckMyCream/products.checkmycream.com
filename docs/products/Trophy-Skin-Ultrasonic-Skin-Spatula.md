      <li>I have paid more money for facials what I get results with this.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I feel like many people who get this device would quit using it before they discover how.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love them all but probably use this the most.</li>
      <li>Also I&#x27;m able to vibrate junk out of a clogged pore instead of picking at it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is doing, but those areas, even under the eyes, look better.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE  </li>
      <li>There are several videos on you tube showing how to best use the device which I recommend.  </li>
      <li>I had to keep it plugged in all day to be able to use it even for a minute.</li>
      <li>I have to use more moisturizer afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so make sure to saturate it or it won&#x27;t work as well or just stop working and beep at you.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>love the way this gets all the blackheads out of the side of my nose.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s got more buttons that I kept accidentally pushing while using the unit and turning it off.  </li>
      <li>just say ok for me</li>
      <li>It does a good job of keeping my face smooth and gunk free in the interim.  </li>
      <li>but this had made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>But they did not provide me with free return shipping label; I had to pay to return it</li>
      <li>My skin feels so smooth and looks rejuvenated after each use.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy using this Labelle.  </li>
      <li>This device is excellent at removing the debris that gets trapped in my pores.</li>
      <li>but the first try it was so easy to use!</li>
      <li>am 55 and my skin is showing signs of aging but this remarkable product has definitely reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles not to mention improved skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I just wish the manual was more detailed because it didn&#x27;t say that I have to charge it first for 4 hours.</li>
      <li>I love this device - it makes my skin feel so incredibly clean and does exactly what it says it will.  </li>

      <li>I am utterly surprised at how effective the Labelle is.</li>

      <li>My skin feels fresh and clean and not at all clogged.</li>
      <li>own a clarisonic, facial steamer, the microdermmd and a led light for my face (also got thru Trophy Skin).  </li>
      <li>They sent a new spatula, which works much better than the dud I received first, plus a gift!</li>
      <li>I look much more refreshed and my skin is clear.</li>
      <li>Honestly for this alone I&#x27;d pay double.  </li>
      <li>my skin is in great shape and although I use it on the rest of my face, unless I have a small blemish it doesn&#x27;t scrape much off that I can see, however my skin is super smooth after using it.  </li>
      <li>I originally posted a negative review about this product &amp; the company contacted me to see what they could do to make me happy.</li>
      <li>This tool makes the gunk that builds up come right out.  </li>
      <li>really helps me get his pores clean and his face moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Taking a hot shower opens my pores, assisting with the success i have with the scrubber.</li>
      <li>was very intrigued and excited to order this product when I first saw it on the Trophy Skin website.</li>
      <li>Probably too soon to even give it four, not even quite sure what it does, but my skin does seem to be looking a little better.</li>
      <li>It works better right after showering when your pores are open.  </li>
      <li>If you educate yourself enough and handle with care you&#x27;ll do fine!</li>
      <li>The new spatula works as advertised and the free gift more than makes up for the initial aggravation.</li>
      <li>Product is very easy to use and stays charged for a long time.</li>
      <li>skin is pretty oily and I deal with clogged</li>
      <li>The first night that I used it, I did not see a difference.  </li>
      <li>When I initially used a skin scraper, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working.  </li>
      <li>You have to make sure that you have enough water on your skin</li>
      <li>I saw another band on QVC but it was more expensive, and because I had already had good luck with this company I thought I&#x27;d try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used the infusion mode as much as the scraper mode, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the results of this little device.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin with large pores.  </li>
      <li>I am so oily that i don&#x27;t really have to use any water when i use it.  </li>
      <li>This unit seems to be very well made.  </li>
      <li>It made my face look a whole lot lighter and healthier.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>One week I used it every day and it was too much as it</li>
      <li>This did not remove as much sebum and debris as promised.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend something that&#x27;s not rechargeable!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very week product and low power. I highly recommend something that&#x27;s not rechargeable!</li>
    <li> Got this for my fiancée she loves it</li>
    <li> do not waste money. it just makes vibrating sound and clear up little white heads. beside that, this gadget serves no purpose.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order again.. not seeing a difference and battery has to be charged all the time... kinda a waste of money...sad</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin with large pores.  This tool makes the gunk that builds up come right out.  I am so oily that i don&#x27;t really have to use any water when i use it.  However, my husband has dry skin and steaming his face then using some clear aloe gel to help the scrubber glide along really helps me get his pores clean and his face moisturized.  I totally recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this last November through Trophy Skin.  I have a number of other products from the company as well and have had outstanding customer service from them no matter if I purchased here or directly from the website.  I had purchased the microdermmd fromQVC (another trophy skin product) and really liked it so I thought I would try this as well.  I saw another band on QVC but it was more expensive, and because I had already had good luck with this company I thought I&#x27;d try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this gets all the blackheads out of the side of my nose.  Honestly for this alone I&#x27;d pay double.  It was always so frustrating coming home after a facial and within a few days having the blackheads back no matter what cleanser or peels I used.  This little device works so well for that.  You have to make sure that you have enough water on your skin so make sure to saturate it or it won&#x27;t work as well or just stop working and beep at you.  Play with the angle and apply just a little pressure (I learned the hard way that I was pushing too hard without enough water and caused a small abrasion...totally my fault but learn from me and don&#x27;t do it)  Besides the sides of my nose my skin is in great shape and although I use it on the rest of my face, unless I have a small blemish it doesn&#x27;t scrape much off that I can see, however my skin is super smooth after using it.  I have not used it to apply serums but it has a second function that will pulse it in the skin.  Read the directions, it gives a series of three or five beeps and stops when the battery is low, usually it will restart again and stop again shortly after so make sure to recharge it.  The battery does get warm (at least mine does) when using it and charging but not uncomfortably hot, and it doesn&#x27;t last a super long time so make sure to bring the charger with you if you are going away for the weekend and plan on using it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I own a clarisonic, facial steamer, the microdermmd and a led light for my face (also got thru Trophy Skin).  I love them all but probably use this the most.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My only complaint would be the instruction manual. This tool for facial rejuvenation does a poor job at explaining how to use this device for the uninformed. It took me about a week of trial and error to actually figure this out. I feel like many people who get this device would quit using it before they discover how.</li>
    <li> I have been using this scrubber for about a month. I have larger pores around the t zone area and this is where I mainly use.  It works better right after showering when your pores are open.  I only use once or twice weekly but am happy with the results</li>
    <li> This thing does a great job. As someone who has never had clear, even porcelain skin, I always had white heads or milia or just bumps and uneven spots. I could even feel the uneven-ness when I washed my face and ran my fingers across it.&lt;br /&gt;This little gadget makes such a difference. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is much smoother and more even now.&lt;br /&gt;My only tiny complaint about it is that when you charge it, it makes this high pitched squeezing sound, it&#x27;s pretty quiet but still audible.&lt;br /&gt;Just leave it charging in your bathroom while you are in another room and you&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> This tool is amazing!! I was skeptical at first but I have been using it diligently for 2 weeks now and I am astounded by the difference in the appearance of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I am 55 and my skin is showing signs of aging but this remarkable product has definitely reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles not to mention improved skin tone.  I would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  If used regulary I do see a difference.  I have paid more money for facials what I get results with this. I am happy. But nothing is a 100%.  I never had problems w it overheating or buzzing in the ear as other reviews. You do have to use it properly as if used upside down it doesn&#x27;t extract its for smoothing on creams. Just read directions.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything as far as as I can tell</li>
    <li> Great product for getting your pores clean and makes your face feel fresh!  Product is very easy to use and stays charged for a long time.</li>
    <li> This did not remove as much sebum and debris as promised.  It is a poor exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;Leaving water on your face so long to use the instrument actually makes my skin dryer.  I have to use more moisturizer afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it for 30 days to see if results improve.  If not, I will return it.  Doesn&#x27;t make sense to  waste $150.</li>
    <li> I saw no results at all from using this item.  I washed my face in advance and purposely did not do a thorough pore scrubbing, as I wanted to give the ultrasonic device a chance to do its job. It did not pick up any debris for me, did not clean out any pores, I saw no gunk on the device. However, I did ship it back to Trophy Skin for refund. But they did not provide me with free return shipping label; I had to pay to return it myself.&lt;br /&gt;I was very intrigued and excited to order this product when I first saw it on the Trophy Skin website. But it just did not do anything at all.</li>
    <li> after using it several times, it does not work for me. i don&#x27;t see any improvement. just say ok for me</li>
    <li> It does help to remove the water from your but I&#x27;m not sure if it cleanse pores as I only used it for 2wks</li>
    <li> The first one we received would not charge but was able to quickly receive a replacement. The new one works perfectly, the spatula performs as described, and is great for removing blackheads. That said, we just received it a week ago, so can&#x27;t say how well it holds-up over time.</li>
    <li> I have used this little guy for over two months and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  My skin feels so smooth and looks rejuvenated after each use.  It&#x27;s so easy to use as well!</li>
    <li> This spatula doesn&#x27;t work as it&#x27;s promoted it overheat and stop working for hours. Don&#x27;t buy it it has a really bad quality</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve had it for about a month.  It has met my expectations.</li>
    <li> The Labelle Skin Spatula works great on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin with pores that clog and congested pores that are full of yuk.&lt;br /&gt;I have the Microderm MD and like it, and a Clarisonic which I also like. I am in my mid fifties and just can&#x27;t control breakouts with dermatological care or products or gadgets...&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this gadget is amazing at exfoliating and vibrating the yuk from my pores better than anything I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it it seemed like a funky little thing, but my pores are much less clogged after just a few weeks. I have used it about five times per week. My skin feels fresh and clean and not at all clogged. An added plus is that my random &amp;#34;Italian mustache hairs&amp;#34; are not ingrown as in the past, making hairs on stache and brows more cooperative. I am utterly surprised at how effective the Labelle is. My half Jack Russell pooch is confused by the sound, but that is the only negative. I haven&#x27;t used the vibration for applying skin creams as my skins seems quite balanced now.</li>
    <li> Most of these reviews talk about pore cleaning, but this is also the best exfoliator there is. I bought this after receiving a couple of facials with a similar device and I had to have my own. My skin is dry and sensitive and all the chemical exfoliators I&#x27;ve tried damage my skin and leave it  even drier and with more lines than I had before. Retin A and other acids are out for me. Scrubs irritate or aren&#x27;t effective and can also make my skin look worse. This device removes the dead skin without overdoing it and leaves it soft and smooth. Lines are less noticeable and superficial sun damage is removed. I don&#x27;t think you can overdo it, because it only removes dead skin and can&#x27;t get deeper like a chemical can. I swear it has taken 5 years off my face in 3 week&#x27;s time. I look much more refreshed and my skin is clear. It&#x27;s easy to use, but your face must always be wet. I keep a spray bottle of water or a wet cloth nearby when I use it. You can go right over your crows feet, upper lip, everywhere. It also has a mode that helps your creams penetrate deeper. I use it since I have it -- it&#x27;s warm and relaxing, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the first one I received worked, but it had a bad battery that wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. I had to keep it plugged in all day to be able to use it even for a minute. I contacted Trophy Skin and they immediately sent a replacement. Their customer service is excellent and the replacement has a good battery. I am thrilled with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The Labelle spatula works great for exfoliation and extractions. I also got the argon stem cell serum and it make the skin feel so soft after. I used the second setting on the spatula to drive the serum into the skin. It works great. This is a good purchase</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was a bit afraid of using at first but the first try it was so easy to use! And its great how it can be reused !&lt;br /&gt;My skin is pretty oily and I deal with clogged but this had made a huge difference in my skin. The device is cordless, all you have to do is charge before use. I like how it is rechargeable and it does not require batteries. I like to invest in product for my skin that are actually going to make a difference, and also that i can reuse over again, this is one of them! I recommend !</li>
    <li> Probably too soon to even give it four, not even quite sure what it does, but my skin does seem to be looking a little better. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and it is the only thing I&#x27;ve been doing different. It seems to remove a good amount of cheese from my nose, but as for the rest of the face I don&#x27;t know what it is doing, but those areas, even under the eyes, look better. It does seem to be of good quality, too.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality skin exfoliator. You can actually see the impurities coming out of your pores and the deed skin on the blade. Just read the directions, don&#x27;t under estimate this piece of equipment. It should be in the hands of a professional as it could cause damage. If you educate yourself enough and handle with care you&#x27;ll do fine!</li>
    <li> Its expensive and it can no longer hold charge after a few months of normal use.</li>

    <li> I really enjoy using this Labelle.  It made my face look a whole lot lighter and healthier.  I used it one time in the morning after face wash a couple of times during the week.  One week I used it every day and it was too much as it I begin to feel patches on my cheeks.  After that I was back to just a couple of times a week and my face is so much brigher.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I really like it. I just wish the manual was more detailed because it didn&#x27;t say that I have to charge it first for 4 hours.But I emailed the seller and they emailed me back same hour.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it came with no instructions. I&#x27;ve been trying to send it back but I am having some trouble. I would not suggest this product!</li>
    <li> I love it. I&#x27;m a dermatologist and I find it very useful to remove black spots from the sides of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for people that need something to remove black spots from the nose and chin.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work so well for the forehead, but the quality is very good.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Labelle Ultrasonic Skin Spatula and started using it right away.  The first night that I used it, I did not see a difference.  However, the next morning my pores were almost undetectable.  The infusion function is also wonderful and my serum and moisturizer are working much better.  I would recommend this product for anyone who wants cleaner, tighter and naturally luminous skin.</li>
    <li> I have medium sized pores on the sides of my nose and chin that get blocked. This device is excellent at removing the debris that gets trapped in my pores. Taking a hot shower opens my pores, assisting with the success i have with the scrubber. I recommend keeping your skin wet while using to prevent any irritation. There are several videos on you tube showing how to best use the device which I recommend.  I am using the scrubber once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> This unit seems to be very well made.  Simple operation.  only 2 buttons.  exfoliate or infusion, which I liked.  I&#x27;m irked when these devices have multiple power settings and obscure functions.  I want it simple and straightforward.  During first use, I was surprised that I could see gunk coming out of my pores.  I have thick oily skin and It seemed to smooth it out and make my pores less noticeable after a few uses.  It does leave my face a bit red and dry feeling for a few hours after but all good the next morning.  Have not tried the infuser function since my goal is the cleaning function.  I would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I used my sister&#x27;s skin spatula and wanted one of my own.  When I initially used a skin scraper, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working.  I expected the peeled skin to come off like skin after a sunburn, but the spatula is more subtle.  I definitely noticed a reduction of blackheads and that my skin is smoother.  Also I&#x27;m able to vibrate junk out of a clogged pore instead of picking at it.  My makeup looks better now; it seems to adhere and soak in to my skin.  I purchased the Labelle Skin Spatula because it&#x27;s a good price and it&#x27;s cordless.  My sister has the Ezzi-Peel spatula that seems a little fancier but it&#x27;s got more buttons that I kept accidentally pushing while using the unit and turning it off.  I haven&#x27;t used the infusion mode as much as the scraper mode, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the results of this little device.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great company. I originally posted a negative review about this product &amp; the company contacted me to see what they could do to make me happy. They sent a new spatula, which works much better than the dud I received first, plus a gift! The new spatula works as advertised and the free gift more than makes up for the initial aggravation. I would definitely recommend this product  and order from this company again!</li>
    <li> My wife is using it since 2012 and works great! Now it is time to replace the battery but I could not find the specs to buy the correct one....Does anyone know what is the code?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> The exfoliating/cleaning function is my favourite.  I have monthly facials done, so I just use this product once or twice a week for maintenance.  It does a good job of keeping my face smooth and gunk free in the interim.  I gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m not really sure about the infusion function.  Frankly I&#x27;ve tried it but I guess because you can&#x27;t see immediate results there was no wow factor for me.  Maybe with constant use I may see some results with time, but then how would I know if it&#x27;s due to the machine rather than the facial products working themselves.</li>
    <li> I received it 3 weeks ago and already managed to use it 4 times on peeling mode. So far I am very happy with it. After the second use I could see that my pores are much cleaner. Usually I use it once per week after the shower when my pores are open, then I continue with a clay face mask. It looks like a good quality product, made on good plastic, it came well packed.</li>
    <li> A  perfect gift for my wife, she enjoys using it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin (pore cleaning) after using it and following the directions.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to use at first, so look for some youtube videos. Once I got my face wet enough and figured out how to hold it, it really helped the blackheads on my nose. My skin feels really soft after using it.</li>
    <li> I am a 40-something mom of 3 of who has struggled with acne and oily skin for what feels like forever.  I love this device - it makes my skin feel so incredibly clean and does exactly what it says it will.  It&#x27;s amazing to see the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; that comes out of my pores!</li>
    <li> This product did not make a difference on my skin and when I went to return it less than a month later I was told that I cannot return the item.  I am disappointed by both the product, the seller, and Amazon.</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I believe it was defective.</li>
