<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a decent toner. It doesn&#x27;t smell nice like I thought it would, it has a very herbal scent to it, not floral, or citrus like other brands have. It does seem to do what it is intended for. It feels nice after I wash my face, and helps to moisturize my skin. I only gave it four stars, because I found the scent to be a bit off-putting. It has a variety of herbs and antioxidants that help to refresh your skin, and most importantly, the vitamin C. I received a discount on this but my opinions expressed are unbiased and my own.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C toner is a clear liquid, lightly scented, but not unpleasant. It made my face softer and smoother. Did not make my face break out or feel tight after using. Actually helped the redness of roseaca. I&#x27;ve used a lot of vitamen c  facial products and anything with vitamin c is usually a great product. I expected it to make my face feel tight like other toners, or burn, but it did not. I really like it.  I recieved a discount on this product for testing it and sharing my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Great toner for the face. Works like any toner I used in the past. I did receive this product at at discount for my review.</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle toner, 93% Organic. To me it&#x27;s virtually unscented and feels like a clean refreshing spritzer spray. The directions say to spray a cotton ball but I like to spray it directly on my face. It doesn&#x27;t feel or smell like I&#x27;m spraying anything but water on my face but it has a slue of natural organic ingredients that work to keep your complexion blemish free and youthful. It&#x27;s recommended that you follow up with Pure Body Naturals Vitamin C Serum.  Together, they make your skin breathe. This toner is only one part of the regimen for maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that they provide a sticker with the manufacture date and the expiration date. The shelf life is 2 years. That&#x27;s substantial to me but it will never last that long. I use it morning and night. If your looking for a very gentle toner, this one is ideal. It&#x27;s great for those with sensitive skin, acne or those with Rosacea. My boyfriend has Rosacea and he finds it as gentle as Aveda products. Sample provided to try and test as a consumer for review purposes regardless of my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toner for several days. I got rid of the spray top and just use the toner on a cotton swab. Definitely cools and refreshes my skin. I use this after I use soap, initially, then the toner. I have several products from Pure Naturals and this one does not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;* promotional discount provided for review purposes*</li>
    <li> This product does really work. I have less wrinkles, tighter skin and less break outs. My skin is more glowing and also less oily. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this!  This product had replaced my daily toner for sure. I have oily acne prone skin and it had cleared my face up tremendously. It has no scent which i love. My only grip is that i feel i may go thru this product rather quickly. I would totally repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love that this product came with a spritz top. I also love the sweet smell. I like that is an easy cure to sunspots in the GA heat. It great on the go just spray a couple sprays and you are fine.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It has a pleasant smell, but I personally prefer scent-free products. I did not read the instructions too carefully, so I sprayed it on my face (it says to spray on a cotton ball.) I was a little concerned about spraying anything in my face, as my eyes are sensitive (of course, I closed my eyes.) But that was user error (however, after reading some other reviews, it seems like most people are spraying it directly to the face, so I&#x27;m not alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it dried, which does quickly, it does leave the skin feeling soft and smooth. I have combination skin, but T-zone tends to get quite oily, and the rest, quite dry! So it is a challenge to find products that target my bi-polar skin!&lt;br /&gt;This was not greasy, but was moisturizing, so for me it worked great for both zones/areas in my face. It is a generous amount, the bottle is quite big, and for the small amount you use, it should last a long time. It was also carefully wrapped, which is good. It comes with the spray adapter separately, so it is optional (and since you are supposed to use a cotton ball or a pad, so it&#x27;s your call, really.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion to the manufacturer is to make the straw smaller! At least the one I received, it was too long, It almost curled back up (it formed a letter J shape inside the bottle). So it was at least an inch (or a little more) longer than what it needs to be.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Not only use it for face, but also it&#x27;s clearing up a scar I had on my arm. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased a toner for my skin that contains vitamins, and wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like this product. I read good reviews and since it was organic I wanted to try it. It has a herbal scent to it, and feels refreshing on the skin. I do feel like once I spray it on my skin looks a hydrated. Overall it&#x27;s a great product, and works well!</li>
    <li> This product has saved my skin literally!  I recommend this 100% and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have finicky, combination skin that gets increasingly oily as summer wears on. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products to combat the excess grease, dirt, and clogged pores. Vitamin C toner remains my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner is simple to use. After cleansing, I just close my eyes and spray it on my face. The product helps to keep my pores clear and helps prevent my skin from producing excess oil. For areas with blackheads, whiteheads, or pimples, I will sometimes spritz it on a cotton pad and rub it on a little more thickly than the mist allows. This toner leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. It leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I have horrible skin it never stops an endless cycle. I get it looking great and boom another breakout attacks. Is it stress of having 2 teenager daughters? Probably so I&#x27;d say. Needless to say I wanted to try this product and see if it would help.&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived very quickly. I ama prime member so that is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this is an all natural product. Afterall we all get to many chemicals everyday all over our skin!&lt;br /&gt;It came boxed nicely and wrapped. You do have to remove the lid and put in the spritzer part.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super funny about smells I have always had a gag reflex like you can&#x27;t imagine! So the true test to me came doing this.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it passed the test!!!! I didn&#x27;t gag now I can really go all out and start putting this to work!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is nice size and will last you a long time. It only takes a few pumps to get a good hydrating splash to your face.&lt;br /&gt;Wow it feels so good and refreshing! I have even started noticing a difference very quickly. I also love it comes with dates easily for you to see!&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up from this mom! I was sent a free sample of this item to review and I have reviewed it in my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Very mildly sweet and minty.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Damp, refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Neutral, smooth.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Suitable for all. Didn&#x27;t tighten, dry, or irritate my very sensitive skin the way most toners do.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: 4-oz amber plastic bottle with spray cap.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* The mild moisturizing and tightening effect provides a temporary reduction in very fine lines. Doesn’t last long, though.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* With ingredients like vitamin C, tea tree, aloe, bilberry, white willow bark, and sugar maple extract, this should, as part of a broader skin care routine, have positive effects on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Toner is packed with Bilberry Extract, which boosts blood circulation and reduces the appearance of wrinkles. Sugar Maple Extract works to repair cell damage caused by free radicals, helping to reverse the signs of aging. They might seem arbitrary to some, but toners are a life saver for skin throughout all seasons! After washing your face, facial toners play an important part in keeping your face looking healthy and clean. Toners balance your skin&#x27;s pH, detoxify your skin, shrink pores, reduce acne, clear blemishes, and hydrate/moisturize skin. I love this toner because it is very easy to use and works as a great base for other moisturizers and/or a great primer for makeup application. With other toners, I tend to waste them because I need cotton balls or pads to apply them but with this toner I only need to spray and then use a cotton ball/pad to apply the toner evenly. This product is all natural and comes in a convenient 4oz. size, I highly recommend it for daily use!  This product was provided to me at no to low cost. All thoughts are unbiased and of my own opinion.</li>
    <li> I recently received this Pure Body Naturals vitamin C serum. I am always looking for natural good products and this is one of them. I love that it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. I like to use it at night before going to bed. So when I wake up my skin looks great! Moisturized and smoother even skin tone. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling neither dry or oily.</li>
    <li> I think this facial toner is great. I recently received this Vitamin C facial toner by Pure Body Naturals. It shipped in a fast an timely manner and was well packaged. It comes in a nice sized 4 oz spray pump bottle. It is very easy to use- just spray directly on face, then let dry. It can also be worn under makeup. This vitamin C facial toner has ingredients like cranberry, orange peel, sugar maple and white willow bark extract. It has anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce blemishes, erase blackheads, and regulate oil production. It also contains sugar cane and aloe extract which help to keep your skin moisturized, vibrant, and looking smooth. This Vitamin C toner is great for all skin types. It is made in the USA. It doesn&#x27;t contain any fillers, chemicals, or artificial ingredients. I applied this toner right after washing my face and almost immediately I noticed a difference in my skin. My skin was more toned, I had less facial redness and it looked smoother. I am impressed with the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review</li>
    <li> I will say that I love the smell of this product. I will also say that it works and I am very happy I was given a chance to buy it at a reduced price to review it. I used my girlfriends skin toner to compare the products. I have extremely sensitive skin so I was nervous about using either product. Her skin toner did not smell good and after 20 minutes my face felt very dry. The next day I used this vitamin toner and it smelled great and my skin did not feel dry at all. I didn&#x27;t have any type of reaction to it. I am going to buy my girlfriend a bottle to try this since I have had such great results with it. I have used it for 4 days now and I can tell my wrinkles on my forehead are less noticeable then before.</li>
    <li> You clean your face but are you getting everything removed completely? User error or product lacking, but not all cleansers, in fact most of them, do not clean my face as completely as needed the first time. Just look at the towel after you wash your face..how can there still be makeup on the towel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where toners come into your cleansing routine. Toners are used to remove any makeup and dirt after you can cleaned your face with a cleanser. Using a toner will help to soften the skin and clean off any soap residue that was not dissolved by rinsing, along with any remaining makeup left on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using the toner along with my other daily skincare products (cleanser, serum, and a moisturizer) I have noticed a difference in the feel and look of my skin. Even in my mid-fifties I suffer  from an occasionally flare-up of blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> *I have bought this product with a big discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a toner user but this is one of the few that I like. The organic Vitamin C toner is very refreshing to the face. I even use it on my neck area too. It is simple and easy to use, just spray onto a cotton ball and apply on your clean face. I like this toner because it does not have that sting and my skin feels really soft afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is Made in the USA. The ingredients include aloe vera, sugar maple and orange peel which contributes to help your skin clean, less wrinkly and free from radicals and other impurities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use this again because I can see results after 2 weeks of usage and the best part, it didn&#x27;t give me the sting.</li>
    <li> This Pure Body Naturals Vitamin C Toner seriously makes my skin feel so refreshed. I&#x27;ve never really used a toner before because I&#x27;m not all that knowledgeable in the skin department but I recently received Pure Body Naturals Vitamin C Anti Aging Serum(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G75X158?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00) and it does say that if you are going to use a toner to use it before you apply the serum so I figured why not try them both out! I&#x27;m so glad I decided to do that because the two together make my skin feel and look so much better then it ever has. This toner isn&#x27;t heavy,absorbs quickly,and feels amazing on my skin. It does have a scent to it but it&#x27;s not too strong and it goes away quickly after it has dried. The toner is easy to apply and a little bit goes a long way. This toner comes in a 4oz bottle which will definitely last for awhile and it also comes with a spray pump which makes it a lot easier to just spray a little on your face and rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this toner at night before bed after cleaning my face and before using the serum. My skin gets hydrated and moisturized at the same time! Pure Body Naturals has definitely made two amazing products that work absolutely perfect with each other! I would definitely recommend the Pure Body Naturals Vitamin C Toner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> This toner seems to be helpful for acne and helps even out my complexion.  I really like the the majority of the ingredients are plant-based and are known to have beneficial properties for the skin.  The one negative is that it has the preservative EDTA in it, at least it is the very last ingredient listed.  I really did not notice any hydrating effect.</li>
    <li> I have added this toner into my skin care  regimen. Although I have not yet seen a huge difference I really like the scent and that it comes with a spray nozzle. I received this with a promotional discount.</li>
    <li> I order this product Monday, August 10, 2015 &amp; received it Wednesday morning ! 1st impression: -There&#x27;s a slight smell to it but it&#x27;s not overpowering. -Drys well and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling  I&#x27;ll be updating once after a week of trying this product.  Update***  Aug 20, 2015  I have really bad heat bumps on my face, lately I&#x27;ve noticed they&#x27;ve slightly reduced. Is it because of the vitamin C ? Possibly! I&#x27;ll continue to use this produce</li>
    <li> I have been loving  this as my toner. I usually  always  use witch hazel  toner but switched  to this as I was intrigued  in the ingredients. This not only balances my ph levels  but also has anti aging benefits that most toners don&#x27;t have. I will continue  to use this and will repurchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was sent to me for free/discounted price for review purposes. All opinions  are 100%  mine and unbiased.</li>
    <li> Been using this toner ,for about a week,did not irritate my skin,no redness,very easy to use.My face never felt better.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK</li>
    <li> I like it! I use the spray.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Toner!! Vitamin C is great stuff. After using this toner my skin felt clean and refreshed, I have been using Vitamin C for years and this one is as good as any. Vitamin C is your friend.</li>
    <li> I recieved the package and everything was secured and still in the original package. I was able to open the package and try it for the first time. I have very senstive skin and this didnt make or effect my skin which is great. I was glad to try something that was all natural and organic.My skin looks and feels amazing.I received the item for testing and review purposes</li>
    <li> I do like this toner, the smell is very gentle not overbearing. When I received it I did think that it was cool that the toner came with a spray pump so you could lightly mist your face but soon after reading the directions discovered that you had to apply the sprayer directly to a cotton ball and I thought &amp;#34;bummer&amp;#34;. But overall after application it leaves the skin nicely refreshed, no stickiness at all. I follow up with the Pure Body Naturals Vitamin C Serum and Retinol Moisturizer. I also want to add that I exfoliate my skin as well and it is helping clear up my acne scars and reducing my pore size.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I expected, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything any other less expensive toner does.  Wished it smelled better, doesn&#x27;t smell like citrus at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great toner. Honestly, I have often skipped toner in favor of just washing and applying moisturizer. My current routine involved a blackhead clearing scrub and Argan oil to finish. With the addition of this toner, I saw a very noticeable change in my skin within a few hours. It seems to have brightened as well as becoming even more soft. I use this on my acne prone face, neck and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very refreshing toner that absorbs quickly. It is of superior quality. I find the results superior to that of rose water or witch hazel. It came in a plastic bag which would have been awesome had it leaked, but it didnt! Good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product free/at a substantial discount for my opinions and review.</li>
    <li> After using this my face felt &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and ready to get on with the day. There is a scent to it but it is so light you don&#x27;t smell it all day. Easy application process. Great for use right after a shower and before bed. The 4oz bottle can really go a long way if used properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposed and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> I have bought a bunch of products from this company and they are always at a good price. The ingredients are usually top notch as well. This one fits the bill. I use the toner after I shave and it feels awesome. My skin feels softer and looks more vibrant afterwards. I would buy this Vitamin C toner again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying a vitamin  C toner! I am already a super&lt;br /&gt;huge fan of all facial things, that include vitamin C..&lt;br /&gt;I love the packaging, it comes in a nice bottle, with a well functioning&lt;br /&gt;pump. An ample mist sprays out with each pump...&lt;br /&gt;It feels so refreshing on your face... I used this product,&lt;br /&gt;up to 3 times a day. Maybe too much :) I did use it&lt;br /&gt;every time I washed my face...&lt;br /&gt;I waited a few days, after my first use, to make sure that I did&lt;br /&gt;not experience any itching, burning, or redness. My skin does seem to&lt;br /&gt;be sensitive sometimes. I want to make sure my testing was as thorough as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I think my skin responded so well to this toner! It has replaced my old&lt;br /&gt;toner. I just wish it came in a bigger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately I noticed my skin was more taught....&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this item free, for testing purposes, the findings above are my own opinions!!</li>
    <li> Fighting with annoying white heads, I was egger to try this out since the all natural way is the best way to go now a days. This was the fasted shipped item I&#x27;ve ever purchased online. Literally. I&#x27;ve been using this spray for a few days and I do have a few bumps now. But I&#x27;m pretty positive it&#x27;s only because this product is doing its job and cleaning everything out of my pores. I will continue to use this product confident that it&#x27;s going to help get all that crap out of my pores. It is not a thick spray, it&#x27;s very light. It does not leave my face sticky, oily, or anything else of that nature. It is also a very light, almost  unscented smell. I spray it onto a soft rag and gently clean my face (after cleaning it) and then I spray just one spray directly onto my face. I am excited to see the end result after using it for a few more weeks. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of this InstaNatural vitamin C toner. It&#x27;s such a nice and relaxing mist after washing all my makeup off. So far I have noticed my face clearing up since I started using this toner. I&#x27;ve also noticed my pores look smaller. This toner has made it so easy for my moisturizer to penetrate into my skin. It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin like mine. It&#x27;s gentle and very effective. Only problem I have is that it doesn&#x27;t smell the best.but otherwise  I am so happy I have included this vitamin C facial toner into my daily skincare routine. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> This toner is the best. I love that it comes in a pump bottle so that i can just spray it on my face, and don&#x27;t have to use a cotton swab. I have mild acne and my derm recommend using a vitamin C serum to help, but it felt very oily and weird on my skin. this toner does not feel oily, and is refreshing. It doesn&#x27;t smell particularly good, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I was expecting a orangey fruit scent but it smells like the peel. This also has aloe in it so its awesome for repairing skin, and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is less red the morning after using it. My sensitive skin was not at all phased by this either, which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> Received this item for review, and it is great. so refreshing on the skin.  This had no smell that I can detect, which is great, this is great for sensitive skin.  love the spray top so I can mist it all over my face before bed.  Absolutely love this toner!  Already notice a difference in my face, it seems brighter!</li>
    <li> I really like this facial toner, and it smells really good.  I noticed a change in my face in 4 days . I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good facial toner. I did get this at discount price .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is doing good, but my dermotologist tells me that Vitamin C products are GOOD.  So, I am enjoying using this toner.</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure Body Naturals - Vitamin C Toner refreshes my face. This was my first time using this awesome toner. The toner is easy to apply. You don&#x27;t even have to use a lot. I first washed my face. I then took a cotton ball and gently applied the toner. As soon as I put it on my face felt refreshing. You can feel a tingle in your pores. This is how you know it&#x27;s working. It did not irritate my skin like other toners have. I have made this apart of my daily regimen</li>
    <li> I have to tell you, I LOVE this serum already. I usually have a reaction to things but this is working great. The serum will does not clog my pores like most serums i have tried in the past &amp; I&#x27;m so glad it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens or alcohol. It&#x27;s keeping my skin smooth and acne free. I have skin damage caused by the sun so it&#x27;s helping with that as well. I like that it comes with a normal closed lid, but it also comes with a spray head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m very happy with the Organic Vitamin C toner. I would definitely recommend and would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;**This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes.

    <li> I was compensated for my review with a discount of the product. Honestly, I don&#x27;t care for it. The smell and the stickiness it leaves on your skin I don&#x27;t like. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Pure Body Naturals products have not failed to impress me yet!  I received the Vitamin C toner on time expertly packaged. Its made with Aloe, Orange peel and Tea Tree oil. It gently exfoliates my skin to open pores. My skin tone seems to be improving after just a few days; I can&#x27;t wait until I&#x27;ve been able to use a for a month to see the improvement in wrinkles - we all get those as we age.  My grandson is using it for his mile acne and has seen improvement there as well.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I WASH MY FACE, AND THEN SPRAY IT ON.  IT HAS A SLIGHT TINGLE, AND MY FACE FEELS SO REFRESHED!!</li>
    <li> I really like this. It&#x27;s seems to calm my rosacsea.</li>
