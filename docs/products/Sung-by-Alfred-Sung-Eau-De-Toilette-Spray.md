      <li>My husband has used Sung for years and gets more compliments on how good he smells than anyone I know.  </li>
      <li>It smelled like something that would have been popular in 1985.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that with this stuff, you have to go very light -- lighter than I&#x27;ve ever gone with any fragrance to be honest.</li>
      <li>I used to wear Sung many years ago, and it was beyond amazing.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s mostly a very strong over the top, old-school, old-man scent.</li>
      <li>The price was nothing special but it was fair for this outstanding product.  </li>
      <li>A crisp, clean and pleasant scent that is especially good for daytime use, and at a reasonable cost.</li>
      <li>and I love it for being so</li>
      <li>I have gotten so many compliments on this scent.</li>
      <li>He will have some for a year or more</li>
      <li>I enjoy anything that smells nice, no matter what it costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it smells mostly like a blend of spices and citrus.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve love it every since.  </li>
      <li>and it is my fathers favorite</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love \\&quot;his</li>
      <li>Its a nice light spice and citrus</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this cologne.</li>

      <li>I just wished for more.  </li>
      <li>I love the spicy smell of it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just okay, though it&#x27;s gotten some attention.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed this Alfred Sung version for many years.</li>
      <li>Nice light smell.</li>
      <li>it is a favorite on our home.</li>
      <li>I thought for sure it was a womans purfume.  </li>
      <li>he goes a women has to say i love your perfum</li>
      <li>I like it a lot; but, it does not remind me of my Sung for Women at all :)</li>
      <li>When I recieved it and smelled it, I had to get on here and make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite men&#x27;s fragrances...difficult to find these days.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite cologna.  </li>
      <li>THAT BEING SAID, What sticks out the most is the Lemon,pepper and jasmine.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and on more than one occasion had an acquaintance ask what it is and where to find it.</li>
      <li>I will try this summer to see if I get better results...</li>
      <li>I love Sung.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for years and have gotten many compliments on the way it smells.</li>

      <li>Highly recommend !!!!!</li>
      <li>Cool water is nice.</li>
      <li>its just ok a bit strong and does not truns heads the way i would like</li>
      <li>Clean, piney, quite a deal!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using this since 1989. Try it for something new, different and appealing.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product for a long time, for me it&#x27;s a time;less product.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I recently wanted to expand beyond my old and paltry collection of Drakkar, Georgio RSVP (yes, I lived in the 80&#x27;s), and Kenneth Cole RSVP. So I bought the sampler of CK from Amazon (Obsession, Eternity, CK One, IN2U, and Euphoria). Euphoria was my favorite, IN2U was OK, and the other two made my eyes water for hours. I then buckled down and got full size bottles of Versace Pour Homme, Cool Water, Alfred Sung, Versace Dreamer, and Very Irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dreamer and Very Irresistible smell almost like clones of each other. Versace for Men and Euphoria, are also pretty close, although Versace is much cleaner and more complex. Cool water is nice. That&#x27;s it. It is nice. Good for business or a night out with your sister. The rest of the CK line is too common. That leaves Sung. This is by far THE most unique scent I purchased. It doesn&#x27;t smell remotely like any of these others. It has the smell of aged oak that is freshly cut. It&#x27;s THAT woodsy. And it doesn&#x27;t smell artificial. Two spritzes on my neck and one inside each elbow and I&#x27;m good to go for 4-6 hours. I&#x27;m afraid to try it on my clothes in fear that it will get on my coat, and fight with other scents when I decide to wear something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a true \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; scent in your collection, that has NO sweetness, but isn&#x27;t a slap in the face either, then pick up this older, affordable scent. Even though it&#x27;s an older scent, it stands out from others. Way out.</li>
    <li> Have to say......I have a ton of high end colognes.......Halston-Dolce......you name it.....I probably have it.......but none of them have received anywhere near the compliments that Sung gets.......and it seems the slightly older women love it.......30 and up !!!  Even some men have asked what I was wearing.......lol........now whether it&#x27;s my chemistry and Sung or what.......it works on me .......and the best thing is that I don&#x27;t taste it.......if that makes sense.......many other colognes I taste and kinda makes me ill but not Sung......just a great, not overly heavy scent........Highly recommend !!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne because of the reviews that I read on here.  When I recieved it and smelled it, I had to get on here and make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake.  I thought for sure it was a womans purfume.  Weird that the ratings are so good on here.</li>
    <li> Nice light smell. Great for spring and summer,  but can be worn anytime. Would recommend to people.</li>
    <li> I first discovered Sung in the duty-free shop at Houston International Airpost around l6 years ago while waiting to depart on a dive trip to Roatan, Honduras.  I bought it upon return to the U.S., and have used it steadfastly ever since.  If it goes off the market I am sunk, as I&#x27;ve found no other scent that even comes close in terms of pleasantry and attractiveness.  This is how I want to smell.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item based on all the wonderful reviews it received. I actually like the cologne but it&#x27;s not my favorite. I was looking for something light, clean, and masculine for my boyfriend. This one is a little too powdery/flowery for my liking. My boyfriend actually said he liked it better on me. His friends have said it smells \\&quot;girly.\\&quot; However, it&#x27;s subtle and lasts long. For the price, it was worth buying! I do not believe I will be purchasing it again, that&#x27;s just personal preference.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS COLOGNE FOR MY HUSBAND AND IT ARRIVED RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES AND THE PRODUCT WAS PERFECT. NO COMPLAINTS. I WOULD DO IT AGAIN. GREAT FOR GIFTS TOO..HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading reviews from others and what a great buy! I have gotten so many compliments on this scent. I was already familiar with Alfred Sung and I loved the price I got here. I will keep this as one of the scents I keep on hand. A great addition.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using Sung for Men for several years.  It smells so good I wouldn&#x27;t let him consider trying another spray.</li>
    <li> What not exactly what he was looking for</li>
    <li> My husband and grandson loves this cologne.</li>
    <li> Nice oriental spice fragrance...It&#x27;s a shame that the longevity on this is only 3 to  4 hrs.  I like it out of the bottle and on my skin but that&#x27;s where things start to fade and it fades rather quickly.  It&#x27;s a pleasant smelling gem I just wished for more.  I will try this summer to see if I get better results...If I do this review will  be updated...</li>
    <li> I can never find this cologne anywhere and it is my fathers favorite i was so glad to find it and the price was great! I bought it for my dad for his bday a week before and it came in time before then.</li>
    <li> This reeks.  I bought it blind because some people said it reminded them of Irish Spring.  This smells more like an Irish man died in a spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries down to a STRONG wood/leather smell.  Not fresh/clean at all.  Unlike Cool Water (1988), this smells ancient (1989).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a soapy scent:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Creed Original Vetiver&lt;br /&gt;2.  Prada Amber&lt;br /&gt;3.  Mugler Cologne&lt;br /&gt;4.  Prada Infusion d&#x27;Homme&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to smell like death, buy Sung.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as he wears this and it makes him smell so good.  He will have some for a year or more</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED SUNG AND IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY COMPAIRABLE SENT TO THE BOTTLE I ALREADY HAVE. I REALLY HATE IT AND WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM THIS COMPANY.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal gentlemen. For an even more real deal 90% off anywhere else. I will keep buying this as it attracts hugely.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this scent.  Too bad its not more popular.  However, since its not more popular the price is great!  Its a nice light spice and citrus</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cologne. This fragrance is my all time favorite. I can spray it on in the morning and it last all day. I can still smell it on my when I get home at night. I get compliments every time I wear it. The fragrance is strong but not over powering at all. If you want to impress your mate, then I suggest you wear this cologne. Sung by Alfred is a classic.</li>
    <li> ne of my favorates. . . GOOD PRODUCT. . . GOOD DELIVERY. . . GOOD DEALER!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an incredible cologne for men.  It is a shame that it can no longer be purchased off the shelf.  Amazon is the best place to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This purple stinker stinks!  I have never had allergies but I sneezed like crazy when I smelled the open bottle!</li>
    <li> What led me to buy Sung was simply because I can&#x27;t find it locally.At it&#x27;s inexpensive price it should be in drug and retail stores right beside Quorum.And I will further state that this has a soapy finish like Quorum and Azzaro Pour Homme use of lavender.between the two I consider Sung to be more of pinewood and Quorum to be mossy.Sung has a little bit of a bitter herbal and floral character to it.Very green in character though I don&#x27;t compare it to Irish Spring which I associate with vetiver grass.It&#x27;s a very difficult scent to explain because it&#x27;s caught between the soapy barbershop approach and the outdoorsy scents that came out in the late eighties like Tsar,Aspen,and Preferred Stock....and I love it for being so different!You smell clean and fresh with some outdoors edge to tie in by it&#x27;s masculine nature.Don&#x27;t be fooled by the purple glass-this is a lavender based cologne so purple it&#x27;s calling card from my take.It&#x27;s no Drakkar Noir from it&#x27;s clean foundation but brings a pretty sophisticated scent to the table.If you don&#x27;t dress sharply you&#x27;ll certainly smell like it!</li>
    <li> This cologne is very hard to find these days, and I really have become fond of the scent, many compliments as it is now a rarer scent....love it A++++++++</li>
    <li> this is amazing! buy the man in your life this cologne. it&#x27;s amazing and was very popular in the 90&#x27;s. everyone will ask where you got it and what it is! a must buy</li>
    <li> very strong, and long lasting</li>
    <li> Bought a $15 small bottle as a blind buy because I had heard this was close to Irish Spring. My first impression was a resounding no, and it was so bad that I almost threw it out. I&#x27;ve found that with this stuff, you have to go very light -- lighter than I&#x27;ve ever gone with any fragrance to be honest. If you apply with the lightest touch, you get a good thing going that I would describe as a blend of pine trees, tobacco, and Irish Spring. It&#x27;s just okay, though it&#x27;s gotten some attention. Good for an older gentleman in a tie maybe, but this really isn&#x27;t my style. I&#x27;m 27, very athletic, and a working-class straight guy who prefers smelling more like a down-to-earth guy-next-door than a posh club-goer. I&#x27;m definitely into inexpensive stuff but this one&#x27;s not for me. May consider wearing again in 25 years if it&#x27;s still around.</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> I used to wear Sung many years ago, and it was beyond amazing. The former bottles of the Sung cologne were so good that complete strangers would approach me to ask me what I was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t like to write bad reviews. But, people that sell this Sung cologne now must be put on notice that these present bottles smell really, really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I had to throw this brand new bottle of this Sung cologne into the garbage. Horrible!</li>
    <li> Yes, this is not a favorable review. Please do me the courtesy of not giving this a \\&quot;not helpful\\&quot; rating just because you happen to like this fragrance. I will discuss the merits of the fragrance itself, not just \\&quot;I like it\\&quot; or \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like it\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit about my background, to place my tastes in context. I&#x27;m a middle-age professional man, a husband, father, in management. I am an avid collector of fragrances. I have somewhere north of 300 fragrances in my wardrobe ranging from cheap synthetics to the best from Amouage, Montale, Czech and Speake, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, and various pure oudhs and attars. My tastes are varied, but in general, I love woody (REAL wood - cedar, oak, oudh), attar, floral, fougere, aqua, \\&quot;greens\\&quot;, and the occasional, very particular gourmand. I do NOT like cinnamon/cardamom, bone-dry incense or patchouli, cheap synthetic \\&quot;wood\\&quot;, cheap synthetic ambergris, or anything that ends up being sickeningly cloying. I am absolutely not a snob about it - I enjoy anything that smells nice, no matter what it costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we get to Sung for Men. It is something that&#x27;s bone-dry, completely synthetic \\&quot;woody\\&quot; fragrance, very much in the same vein as Halston 1-12 and Francesco Smalto. It&#x27;s cheap, sharp, astringent, and perfectly at home on an 80 year old man doddering into Bingo night at the rec hall in a South Florida retirement community. It&#x27;s bone dry, acerbic, stark, and bitter. Bitter is the key adjective. I do NOT like sweet, cloying fragrances. Dunhill Fresh makes me feel a bit sickened. Teaches you the meaning of the word \\&quot;cloying\\&quot;. I like a balanced fragrance - or at least something within the range. Polo Black and Double Black are very sweet but incredibly attractive and enjoyable; Czech and Speake No. 88 or Passage D&#x27;Enfer by L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur are Bone dry fragrances without a hint of sweetness but absolutely, positively pleasant, inoffensive but impressively sublime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sung is not good. I will wear it a little at a time but I will never replace it. This formula is in the category of bitter, synthetic wood. There may be a floral note in the dry-down but it does not redeem the bitter, horrible chemical \\&quot;wood\\&quot;. I only say \\&quot;wood\\&quot; because this is what cheap wood fragrances are supposed to smell like, but it does not smell like wood. It&#x27;s the astringent, bitter smell of a cheap, synthetic \\&quot;formal\\&quot; frag and definitely not worth wearing if you can try out something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy smelling - cheers!</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance for men. I have enjoyed this Alfred Sung version for many years.</li>
    <li> I have alway enjoyed smelling great.  This is my favorite cologna.  I wish it was easier to find.</li>
    <li> This has a very interesting smell to it nothing that i ever smelled before but that&#x27;s because i just started wearing cologne it smells mostly like a blend of spices and citrus. The smell lingers around you for about six hour and it stays on your skin for hours just like the forty dollar colognes.</li>
    <li> My new everyday cologne. Smells good &amp; doesn&#x27;t mix poorly with most shower soap fragrances.</li>
    <li> My youngest son saved up and and spent a lot of money (for his limited budget) to get this product for me probably about 25 years ago.... and I&#x27;ve love it every since.  A crisp, clean and pleasant scent that is especially good for daytime use, and at a reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> I smell like I&#x27;m 21 again.  Loved the smell back then and still do now.</li>
    <li> Very high-quality scent for the price! Amazing projection and longevity.  Reminds you of irish spring soap.  Clean, piney, quite a deal!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s signature fragrance is Sung and I love the way it smells on him! Its light and subtle and sexy! I love \\&quot;his scent\\&quot;! Defintely a good buy on his part :)</li>
    <li> I have worn Sung for Women for years and bought the Sung for men for my husband on impulse. The fragrance is enjoyable and very warm and pleasing. I like it a lot; but, it does not remind me of my Sung for Women at all :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this after everyone comparing it to Coast soap. I can smell that maybe a little bit in the undertones but it&#x27;s mostly a very strong over the top, old-school, old-man scent. I realize scent tastes are subjective but this is not for me. Definitely NOT the &amp;#34;clean, fresh and soapy&amp;#34; scent I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and on more than one occasion had an acquaintance ask what it is and where to find it.</li>
    <li> I like this piece of men&#x27;s fragrances very much. It ist very fresh, with a little touch of flowers (but not to much), and give me a feeling of energy in the spring. I hope get it for a long time more in the future.</li>
    <li> Aroma agradable y perdurable. Buena relación calidad y precio.es un perfume con algún tiempo en el mercado que se ha mantenido.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite frangrance(at least I love him in it). Wonderful pricing for the size. Very hard to find.</li>
    <li> I love Sung.  Very distinct smell, and it lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this cologne more then a few times but it&#x27;s always been for my father. He loves it and refuses to wear anything else and i don&#x27;t understand why. I absolutely can not stand the scent of the cologne but i will continue to purchase it because my father will continue to wear it. If it wasn&#x27;t for him i would never buy this product and i don&#x27;t recommend it to someone looking for a new cologne. If you would like to try something new i would go with Prada&#x27;s new scent &amp;#34;Luna Rossa&amp;#34; its amazing</li>
    <li> I guess I have bought this fragrance now about 4 times in 5 years.. I cant get enough of it..Though I only wear it occasionally, My wife and daughter loves the way it smells. It has a fresh,just out of the shower, clean, not too heavy,fragrance.Top notes are caraway, juniper berries, pepper, artemisia, basil, sage, bergamot, lemon, galbanum, bay leaf and petitgrain; middle notes are aldehydes, carnation, jasmine, caraway, rose, pine tree needles, geranium and spicy notes; base notes are leather, sandalwood, fir, patchouli, musk, oakmoss, vetiver and cedar. THAT BEING SAID, What sticks out the most is the Lemon,pepper and jasmine. Dam does it smell good! It&#x27;s been around since 1989..Guess that should tell you something!</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for 2 reasons; (1) The company that makes this cologne also make \\&quot;Hei\\&quot;, which is a very good cologne. (2) The reviews on here were so enormously positive I was like \\&quot;sure, why not?\\&quot; However, I was very disappointed when I got it and sprayed a couple of squirts. It smelled like something that would have been popular in 1985. It&#x27;s a very old smell with little (if any) real masculine qualities. Usually, I buy high-end colognes like \\&quot;Lacoste\\&quot;, \\&quot;Polo\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Sean John\\&quot;, etc. Because this is a cheap brand it was not a dent in my pocket.  I was just glad it didn&#x27;t cost $50-$60 like other colognes. Needless to say, I WILL NOT be making a second purchase.</li>
    <li> i bought this Alfred sung for a friend eveyr he goes a women has to say i love your perfum</li>
    <li> I really like this cologne,It has a pleasant fragrance and it is very different and it stays with you all day.How ever I still&lt;br /&gt;preferr Paul Sabastian as my firt choice but Alfred Sung is very,very good....</li>
    <li> Great scent that lasts...always get compliments...been using it since the 90&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This product lacked the fragrance I used to be familiar with... I think what was shipped to me was an old bottle...</li>
    <li> It smells like pines. I haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments on it yet, but I don&#x27;t wear it everyday. I prefer Hei, but the same maker. In fact, I was out here buying a 2nd bottle of Hei when I saw reviews of Hei referring to Sung.... so I added to my cart. Both are nice to have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to describe it, I&#x27;d probably say that his is a scent for a slightly older gentleman... whereas Hei is more for a younger man. But that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
    <li> did not like the smell.</li>
    <li> great product delivered on time - excellent smell!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase item was as described arrived quickly &amp; packed well price was also good ! Will buy again from this company</li>
    <li> Great product, good scent the women love. one of my favorites and the price was amazing, this stuff is the real deal and shipped to me fast!</li>
    <li> one of the very best colognes out there in the market today</li>
    <li> My husband has used Sung for years and gets more compliments on how good he smells than anyone I know.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Good Products I will buy again in the future. very very good. thanks</li>
    <li> Came in a spray container and I like that.</li>
    <li> STILL LIKE IT I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR OVER 20 YEARS.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, and I have to say that the price is right, and the size is good. He loves it! it is a favorite on our home.</li>
    <li> Light and &amp;#34;citrussy&amp;#34;, not to heavy, but a little goes a long way. This is something I use as an everyday scent.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to get this product.  The price was nothing special but it was fair for this outstanding product.  I would purchase this again.  It has s fresh masculine smell.  It will last for at least 6 hours in the sun and heat.  A little spray will go a long way.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne and got it for a great price</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband who is very picky about any mens fragrance.  I remembered this from a cruise we took in 1990 and loved it.  Now he does too. Beautiful scent but light, not flowery.</li>
    <li> My husband loved it so much that we purchased several more as gifts for friends.  They have enjoyed them also.</li>
    <li> This is  a great smelling cologne.  I have been using it for years and have gotten many compliments on the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne since it was first introduced.  I love the spicy smell of it.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the price on amazon compared  to retail stores.  This came in the original box, wrapped in plastic.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I used to use this cologne in the 90&#x27;s when I was single and always had a good response from women.  I used to even have married women ask me what it was for their husbands.  After the years went by I used other scents but recently I sought this one out again and had a hard time finding it.  I never thought to look on Amazon and here it was, and cheap too.  I used to pay $45 or more for this same bottle in the 90&#x27;s and here it is only $18!  The scent still gets me the same response it did back when I was younger and single.  I have had nothing but compliments from this.  I was using cologne that cost $70-$80 for an ounce but not anymore!</li>
    <li> its just ok a bit strong and does not truns heads the way i would like but ill still wear it</li>
    <li> Excellent seller. Item as described.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite men&#x27;s fragrances...difficult to find these days. Bought some for one of our sons and he wears it well (on date nights!).</li>
    <li> Using it for over a decade. Clean and cool smelling just strong enough for all day every day use. It&#x27;s got all the good smells to make you smell great all day-highly recommeded!</li>
    <li> Good price.  Came on time.  Love the smell.</li>
