    <li> Not what i was looking for in a phone case. No support or protection for your phone. This case is decoration only</li>
    <li> Simply adorable.  Cute case but if your looking for something with protection this is not your case. If your like me and are very careful with your phone you would be fine. Haven&#x27;t had any color fades or anything. Well worth the price</li>
    <li> Fits perfect. Cute and good quality</li>
