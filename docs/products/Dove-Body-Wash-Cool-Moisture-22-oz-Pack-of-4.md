      <li>The scent is pleasant and the texture is smooth and luxurious.</li>
      <li>do though wished it lathered better.</li>
      <li>I have always trusted Dove care for my soap needs and will continue to do so for many years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d prefer something more floral.</li>
      <li>Since I am not otherwise particularly impressed by this product, that&#x27;s enough for me to keep looking.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This does a good job, would be great for those who don&#x27;t like perfumey products, and has a low level of suds.</li>
      <li>We love Dove body wash.</li>
      <li>this fits our entire family perfectly.  </li>
      <li>The things I like about the Dove bar soap, for the most part, are here as well.</li>
      <li>Still, I wanted to give this a try, and I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>I love Dove soap and body wash because they moisturize better than anything else.</li>
      <li>Dove body wash smells more like hand lotion than a soap with fragrance.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t like the fact that the top is rounded.  </li>
      <li>So much body wash for a great price.</li>
      <li>I find light fragrance that leaves a nice moisturizing feel.</li>
      <li>and I am glad I did</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this body wash.  </li>
      <li>love this soap and love the deal on subscribe an save</li>
      <li>I really love almost all of Dove&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>Yes i love my dove bodywash</li>
      <li>The scent, the moisture, and the nice clean feeling Dove soap gives me.</li>
      <li>I found it did as good of a job at moisturizing as Oil of Olay, although had far fewer suds and didn&#x27;t smell as nice.</li>
      <li>This is a huge bottle of Dove body wash, and I love how it makes my skin feel after using it.</li>
      <li>It has a nice, fresh scent and it&#x27;s moisturizing for what I like to refer to as my ashy body.</li>
      <li>most significant thing for me was that the smell is chemically.  </li>
      <li>It comes out of the bottle easily.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell (that would get a NO vote from the man of the house)</li>
      <li>Our family primarily uses Dove and Olay liquid body wash.  </li>
      <li>It has a light, inoffensive &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Overall a great product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So - no problems, but I&#x27;m going to keep using Dove&#x27;s Fresh Awake brand that I have used for many years.</li>
      <li>I got to try a free sample of this mailed to me from the company.</li>
      <li>good choice for people with sensitive skin, but rather wasteful.</li>
      <li>, the Dove Deep Moisture Body Wash has been the perfect solution for me and doesn&#x27;t leave a sweet, overpowering perfume scent, just a mild fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>but it is still smooth and clean feeling with no residue.  </li>
      <li>skin felt clean but not stripped.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Seems to work well, but it leaves a coating on my skin - the moisturizer, I presume, and I like a squeaky clean feeling after a shower -</li>
      <li>My skin feels revitalized moisturized, and clean with no film feeling on my skin.</li>
      <li>It lathers very well, does a good job of cleansing and a reasonable job of moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I have very dry skin tried this out it smells great</li>
      <li>This is a good overall body wash.  </li>
      <li>Overall a good buy.</li>
      <li>This dove moisturizer body wash is mildly scented and lathers rather luxuriously,leaving the skin somewhat moist and clean smelling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love Dove&#x27;s body washes and the Deep Moisture is my favorite for winter time/cold weather.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t irritiate my skin at all, and rinsed away quickly, without skimping on nourishment for my skin.</li>
      <li>This wash has a mild smell and made my skin feel smoother.</li>
      <li>am very pleased with Dove Body Wash, Deep Moisture.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, the cap is easy to flip up with wet hands, and my skin feels clean.  </li>
      <li>There is a light fragrance reminiscent of Dove products, more of a clean scent, not flowery or perfumey.</li>
      <li>Love dove, keeps my skin soft!</li>
      <li>I use Dove Men&#x27;s Fresh Awake Body Wash, but figured I&#x27;d give this product</li>
      <li>I like the way this body wash rinses clean and fast,</li>
      <li>- I come out of the shower feeling clean, refreshed, pain-free because my skin is no longer cracked and bleeding, and ready to face the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>like the idea of a Dove product that provides &amp;#34;deep moisture&amp;#34; in the shower, but, for me, I&#x27;m better off just cleansing my body generally and applying a moisturizing lotion post-shower.  </li>
      <li>think it&#x27;s perfectly adequate as far as body washes go, and I like the clean, soapy scent.</li>
      <li>it gives you multiple benefits from using just one product and it leaves you feeling super clean!</li>
      <li>but I love the texture and the way it produces a consistent foam that does not dry the skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You need very little, another plus, works even better after a lovely sugar scrub.</li>
      <li>I definitely noticed a difference between this and my regular soap, and it also moisturizes better than the Avon Moisture Therapy I had been using (smells better, too).  </li>
      <li>The Dove seems to be their favorite soap/body wash to use daily.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Dove for years, first in a bar form, then in liquid.  </li>
      <li>It is thick and creamy and I feel great after taking a shower.  </li>
      <li>This is the same moisturizing Dove body wash that we all know and love.  </li>
      <li>I have alwyas enjoyed dove soap,ever since I was a child several decades ago.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s moistuirizing, but not especially noticeably, and it doesn&#x27;t have the smooth feeling that I prefer in the Fresh Awake.</li>
      <li>People that have sensitive skin will welcome this addition to their skin care regimen as there are zero harsh chemicals to irritate the skin.</li>
      <li>The soap produces a nice leather and my skin did not feel as dry as normal.</li>
      <li>thought it was OK as far as cleaning, but that it was kind of thick for a wash.</li>
      <li>I usually use the Dove for sensitive skin, but I also found this to be gentle and it has a very refreshing scent and my skin feels hydrated and so smooth.</li>
      <li>large 22 oz.</li>
      <li>It comes out its the bottle so thick that it&#x27;s easy for it to slip off washcloths, sponges, and most bathing applicators.</li>
      <li>Catching this four pack on sale can make it a value product, but I&#x27;m not sure that I would love this product enough to really do so.  </li>
      <li>This Dove Deep Moisture Body wash has a fairly light smell, but I don&#x27;t really like the scent.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price nice product</li>
    <li> This Dove Deep Moisture Body wash has a fairly light smell, but I don&#x27;t really like the scent.  It&#x27;s a bit too candy-like for me.  It comes out of the bottle in a thick, creamy consistency, but it easily breaks in to chunks, and a bit always slides off my hands when I try to lather it.  The design of the bottle is also a little annoying because I can&#x27;t store it upside down on the ledge of my bathtub, and it doesn&#x27;t have a neck, so I can&#x27;t store it upside down through the holes in my shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizing formula is nice, and my skin definitely feels softer and smoother than with my Irish Spring Body Wash.  While there isn&#x27;t anything terribly wrong with this Dove Body Wash, I probably won&#x27;t buy another bottle after I&#x27;m done with this one.</li>
    <li> This body wash gave me an allergic reaction! I don&#x27;t understand why. I&#x27;ve used it before and this has never happened. I love Dove soap and body wash because they moisturize better than anything else. Such a shame. Will stick to the unscented Dove bar.</li>
    <li> This is a scam since Dove changed the formula. The old version had Glycerin as the 2nd ingredient which meant it had a lot of it. Now glycerin is the 10th ingredient which means it has a small amount of it. Also, soja/sunflower oil moved from 4th to 8th ingredient. Dove reduced the mousturizing ingreadients to basically nothing. I don&#x27;t understand how dare they calling it &amp;#34;deep moisture&amp;#34; after they changed the formula. Now it is just a regular body wash, nothing moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was buying this only because of glycerin being the second ingredient and used it after swimming to reduce itching due to chlorinated water. Not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the original list if ingredients on the 1st attached photo and the &amp;#34;new improved&amp;#34; almost-no-moisture list on the 2nd photo.</li>
    <li> 4 large bottles means I am set for a very long time.  Smells and feels good, skin feels softer, even in winter.  Good product!</li>
    <li> This is a huge bottle of Dove body wash, and I love how it makes my skin feel after using it. I wash with it using a shower poof and it moisturizes my skin a bit better than my other shower washes. Almost like washing with a body lotion. And there&#x27;s no strong fragrance, just a mild soap like smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have softened water, and using this wash with softened water makes both the bottle and the shower floor incredibly slippery. So be careful the first time you wash with this if you have softened water and a slick shower floor. It could catch you off guard and you might slip!</li>
    <li> This is a very thick lotion, so you only need a little each time.  Also, the first squeeze from a full bottle produces a big glob of the stuff, so squeeze gently.  It lathers very well, does a good job of cleansing and a reasonable job of moisturizing.  The scent is fairly neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the fact that the top is rounded.  Many shower products have flat tops so that you can store them upside down, so that the contents are always at the top, thus avoiding waste.  This bottle does not allow that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good choice for people with sensitive skin, but rather wasteful.</li>
    <li> This wash has a mild smell and made my skin feel smoother. I had some chaffed skin on my legs, so we especially eager to try in this area. It seemed to soothe the area along with post bath Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do though wished it lathered better. It comes out its the bottle so thick that it&#x27;s easy for it to slip off washcloths, sponges, and most bathing applicators.</li>
    <li> My favorite wash soap, my body is good</li>
    <li> My wife likes body wash and needs something moisturizing, so this seemed a good bet for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thought it was OK as far as cleaning, but that it was kind of thick for a wash. Smelled OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe add some water to the bottle after using up some of it might help.</li>
    <li> We love Dove body wash. When I can find it at a reasonable price that I do not mind paying, then we buy it.  My foster daughters are mixed, and we have tried different soaps with them.  The Dove seems to be their favorite soap/body wash to use daily.  I like the way it lathers.  I feel like my skin gets rejuvenated after each use.  I like the way this body wash rinses clean and fast, no lingering film of soap on my skin.</li>
    <li> Good product, I purchased for the guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dove for years, first in a bar form, then in liquid.  I far and away prefer the liquid form, even though it&#x27;s so much more expensive.  What I like is that my kids can use this because it&#x27;s so gentle, so they just squeeze it on a wet loofah, and away they go!  One of my children was having some issues with smelling even after taking a shower, and the doctor recommended switching to Dove.  Said those cheaper liquid soaps that look &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; on the shelf actually have all sorts of chemicals that react negatively towards skin, and with children we should as parents offer them more gentle soap like this one.  So we are sticking with Dove.  This particular one, Deep Moisture, honestly I don&#x27;t see much of a difference after a few days of using, but I&#x27;ll keep using it because it&#x27;s so gentle on my skin.</li>
    <li> Our family primarily uses Dove and Olay liquid body wash.  It really does leave the skin feeling moisturized and less dry than normal bar soap.  This has a nice, subtle scent, cleans and moisturizes.  We actually like the other scents better (just a personal preference).  Our pediatrician recommended using the unscented Dove and Olay body washes instead of the more-drying baby washes.</li>
    <li> My ankles and lower legs get dry during the winter and I hate to use lotions, the Dove Deep Moisture Body Wash has been the perfect solution for me and doesn&#x27;t leave a sweet, overpowering perfume scent, just a mild fresh scent.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Yes i love my dove bodywash it arrive on time and i will be ordering again soon</li>
    <li> Creamy lather with a luxurious feel.&lt;br /&gt;Light fragrance&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt clean but not stripped.&lt;br /&gt;I still need a moisturizer but it did feel less dry than usual.&lt;br /&gt;Deducted 1 star for the price pint which seems high for a drugstore body wash.</li>
    <li> I really love almost all of Dove&#x27;s products. I will say that Dove is one of my favorite  body washes, and specially in the cold winter months. I love the scent as well and really seen a difference in my skin in less then a week. If you haven&#x27;t tried this body wash yet, you need to.</li>
    <li> This is the only body wash I will use.</li>
    <li> love this soap and love the deal on subscribe an save</li>
    <li> I love this body wash.  I have extremely dry skin and have tried every soap and body wash out there. I have been using this for about 2 years now and I love it.  Occasionally I would buy another product in between because I want to try something else that is scented but I can instantly feel the difference on how dry the other products make my sense and then I go back to this one again.</li>
    <li> Great value &amp; great scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove body wash for years.  Recommended</li>
    <li> The dove body wash is great.</li>
    <li> Deeply moisturizes. This has a nice feeling to it, now I&#x27;m actually taking baths longer than usual because of this.</li>
    <li> It came on time with prime and smells great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Dove! What more can I say, other than I wish they were the 24 oz bottles, rather than 22 oz. It&#x27;s still a great buy - I even got part of the price reduced with a Dove promotional code.</li>
    <li> This is a review of Dove Body Wash, Deep Moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with this body wash. A little squirt on a pouf resulted in lots of creamy lather. The scent is not over-powering, in fact it is quite subtle and does not linger. Just a clean smell afterwards and my skin did not feel dry or itchy like with other body washes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Everyone comments on how soft their skin is</li>
    <li> I love Dove bar soap, and have never really been big on the body wash. Still, I wanted to give this a try, and I am glad I did. The things I like about the Dove bar soap, for the most part, are here as well. The scent, the moisture, and the nice clean feeling Dove soap gives me. More, a little goes a long way, by which I mean that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot for it to last though the entire shower</li>
    <li> I got to try a free sample of this mailed to me from the company. There&#x27;s not a lot I could say about Dove products that is negative, other than the slightly high prices, and even then, they aren&#x27;t so bad. This is nourishing without being greasy, and almost eliminated my need for a moisturizer after showering. The scent is pleasant and the texture is smooth and luxurious. It didn&#x27;t irritiate my skin at all, and rinsed away quickly, without skimping on nourishment for my skin. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizing properties in this body wash.  I even use it on my face.  Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this body wash for over 15 years and it is all I use. Every time I&#x27;ve tried anything else, I regret it. I even travel with it. It&#x27;s the only body wash that makes my skin feel clean and moist at the same time and it smells so nice.</li>
    <li> So much body wash for a great price. Love dove, keeps my skin soft!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, and I got it at a good price because it was Prime Day!  Fast shipping and the pack came sealed.  I usually use the Dove for sensitive skin, but I also found this to be gentle and it has a very refreshing scent and my skin feels hydrated and so smooth.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have sensitive skin but my husband does not- this fits our entire family perfectly.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell (that would get a NO vote from the man of the house) but it is still smooth and clean feeling with no residue.  The price is a little cheaper than if you would buy it at CVS with coupons when it&#x27;s on sale.  Overall a good buy.</li>
    <li> i have no complaint with service nor product</li>
    <li> My favorite and at a good price!!</li>
    <li> Catching this four pack on sale can make it a value product, but I&#x27;m not sure that I would love this product enough to really do so.  This has a good texture (think creamy, thick), it&#x27;s easy to work into a lather, but it also slightly clings to the skin (so it&#x27;s not a splash and get out product if you like baths vs. showers).  I didn&#x27;t notice that it really made my skin feel softer after one use (which is what the product advertises).  This didn&#x27;t irritate my skin where I had small cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most significant thing for me was that the smell is chemically.  I don&#x27;t smell it when it&#x27;s on my body or afterwards, but when I open the bottle, it&#x27;s not pleasant.  Since I am not otherwise particularly impressed by this product, that&#x27;s enough for me to keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of a Dove product that provides &amp;#34;deep moisture&amp;#34; in the shower, but, for me, I&#x27;m better off just cleansing my body generally and applying a moisturizing lotion post-shower.  When I use this product, I still need a moisturizer for the drier areas.</li>
    <li> I like this product very well.  It has a light, inoffensive &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; fragrance.  I definitely noticed a difference between this and my regular soap, and it also moisturizes better than the Avon Moisture Therapy I had been using (smells better, too).  While it didn&#x27;t eliminate the need to use an after-shower moisture lotion, my skin felt much more moisturized with the combination of the Dove Body Wash Deep Moisture and my usual lotion.  It&#x27;s also a very generous size at 22 ounces and lathers really well using just a small amount, so it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a good overall body wash.  Like with Dove products overall, the scent is nice-smelling without being too much or cloying.  I really like that it is moisturizing, so it gives you multiple benefits from using just one product and it leaves you feeling super clean!</li>
    <li> The Dove Body Wash is thick and luxurious and works up into a really lavish lather. A small dab really goes a long way. It has the texture of a really thick body lotion. It does leave my skin a bit more moisturized than with other soaps. In fact, if you overuse it, you will spend longer than normal trying to rinse it off. In our current drought, I try to take really short showers, so I have to be careful to dispense only a small amount of the body wash. The smooth container makes it a bit difficult to dispense just a small dab when you&#x27;re gripping it with wet hands. Adding some texture to the sides of the container or adding a grip curve to the container (think upside down ketchup bottles) could help with controlling how much you dispense. The scent is quite noticeable when you&#x27;re lathering up but leaves no lingering scent on your skin.</li>
    <li> Dove has been a family soap staple for decades. Why I can remember as a child during bath time pretending my dove bar soap was a boat because it used to float. Fast forward a few decades and Dove still has kept to its roots as a simple, clean and clear soap that moisturizes. The deep Moisture body wash is no exception to Dove&#x27;s Mission statement, as it provides the same results dove has always held fast to. My skin feels revitalized moisturized, and clean with no film feeling on my skin. The scent is very subtle and not overpowering in the least. People that have sensitive skin will welcome this addition to their skin care regimen as there are zero harsh chemicals to irritate the skin. I have always trusted Dove care for my soap needs and will continue to do so for many years. Recommend</li>
    <li> This is a nice body wash. It comes out of the bottle easily. The scent was not too over powering. The soap produces a nice leather and my skin did not feel as dry as normal. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best product.  It is thick and creamy and I feel great after taking a shower.  It really doesn&#x27;t lather a whole lot, unlike regular bodywash or soap.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin tried this out it smells great and my skin did feel great. So why the 3 star&#x27;s? Personally my skin had a allergic reaction to the product still not sure to which ingrediant exactly, but had bleach like stains start to appear on my skin. I ruled this to be the cause after i stopped using it and the marks started to subside. I also find the smell to be a little overwhelming after a while.</li>
    <li> Dove Deep Moisturizing Body Wash leaves my skin soft and supple without a heavy residue or feeling greasy. My skin feels clean but not stripped dry or tight. There is a light fragrance reminiscent of Dove products, more of a clean scent, not flowery or perfumey. The wash makes plenty of suds using a mesh poof. If you exfoliate, this makes a nice moisturizing follow up. I have dry, sensative skin, but I&#x27;ve had no reaction to his product, and I&#x27;ve noticed decreased flaking with each use. I do still need a moisturizer after use though.</li>
    <li> Thanks to the cold, harsh New England winter, my skin has taken a beating recently. I don&#x27;t think there is an area on my body that wasn&#x27;t cracked and bleeding at some point during the winter. On top of that, my two cats have wanted to cuddle all winter and whenever one of them was on my lap she would “knead” my leg until it was full of scratches and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of how bad my skin is, I was eager to try Dove Body Wash, Deep Moisture and I am glad I did - I noticed an improvement almost immediately! I use this with a shower pout - I just put a little bit on, lather it up, and use it all over my body. There is a mild scent - not overwhelming at all. The body wash does a great job of cleaning and moisturizing - I come out of the shower feeling clean, refreshed, pain-free because my skin is no longer cracked and bleeding, and ready to face the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with Dove Body Wash, Deep Moisture.</li>
    <li> My regular body wash is Oil of Olay, so that is what I&#x27;m comparing this body wash too. I found it did as good of a job at moisturizing as Oil of Olay, although had far fewer suds and didn&#x27;t smell as nice. Dove body wash smells more like hand lotion than a soap with fragrance. Personally, I prefer the smell of Oil of Olay and i like the suds, but those are my preferences. This does a good job, would be great for those who don&#x27;t like perfumey products, and has a low level of suds.</li>
    <li> I love Dove&#x27;s body washes and the Deep Moisture is my favorite for winter time/cold weather. It has a nice, fresh scent and it&#x27;s moisturizing for what I like to refer to as my ashy body.</li>
    <li> I use Dove Men&#x27;s Fresh Awake Body Wash, but figured I&#x27;d give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s perfectly adequate as far as body washes go, and I like the clean, soapy scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering or too chemical-smelling, and leaves a pleasant but faint post-shower scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s moistuirizing, but not especially noticeably, and it doesn&#x27;t have the smooth feeling that I prefer in the Fresh Awake. Feels a little too much like soap, and not enough of the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - no problems, but I&#x27;m going to keep using Dove&#x27;s Fresh Awake brand that I have used for many years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for 3 days during my daily shower, and I have to say - I&#x27;m not impressed. I do suffer from winter dry skin on my arms and legs, so decided to test it on only my left side, washing my right side with regular bar soap. After 3 days, I notice no difference at all, which surprised me, considering how oily the product feels. I felt clean, but not necessarily well moisturized. I also have to say I don&#x27;t care for the smell. I have no idea what it is, but it has a rather masculine smell to it. I&#x27;d prefer something more floral. Overall, I won&#x27;t throw it out because it does clean well enough, but I would not buy it again for it&#x27;s moisturizing abilities.</li>
    <li> This dove moisturizer body wash is mildly scented and lathers rather luxuriously,leaving the skin somewhat moist and clean smelling.&lt;br /&gt;I still apply moisturizer to elbow and hands and feet,as it is not extreme,and I do not have a problem with that.(This winter has been a killer on the New York skin)&lt;br /&gt;The large 22 oz. is long lasting and clocks in at a very reasonable price for body wash. I have alwyas enjoyed dove soap,ever since I was a child several decades ago.I like the product and it allows softer skin,without an artificial residue.</li>
    <li> This is the same moisturizing Dove body wash that we all know and love.  The scent is a bit strong, as it usually is, for Dove body products but I love the texture and the way it produces a consistent foam that does not dry the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so convenient to be able to order it online and have it delivered instead of carrying heavy bottles of body wash from the drugstore or the supermarket.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, but it leaves a coating on my skin - the moisturizer, I presume, and I like a squeaky clean feeling after a shower - so, for those of you that want that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling, this is not the product  for you.  But, if you want to be coated in a moisturizer - this would then be your product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent body wash! And to tp it off it really does moisturizer. Absolutely non drying, cleansing and silky, compared to no name brands this is high heaven. You need very little, another plus, works even better after a lovely sugar scrub. Any body wash will cleanse you, Dove will not dry out your skin while it&#x27;s doing it! Excellent!</li>
    <li> Its very thick and makes way more lather with my scrubby glove than any other body wash I&#x27;ve used.  Also renders the floor of my tub, where I shower, very slippery so there&#x27;s something in the formula that is different from others.  It smells nice, the cap is easy to flip up with wet hands, and my skin feels clean.  I don&#x27;t see how a body wash, which cleans you and then is rinsed off, can possibly moisturize so I was not expecting it to.  And it doesn&#x27;t, I still have to use lotion if I don&#x27;t want to go out looking like a scaly reptile.</li>
    <li> I will admit I am a guy and use this Dove body wash. Growing up in India long back, dove soaps used to be an expensive luxury, but they used to stand out. Skin used to feel noticeably moisturized and supple. Same with the body wash. Put some on the loofah and shower on. Dove has carried on its legacy since years across all it&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely dry and that&#x27;s where I find Dove products are terrific- this body wash is no exception. I find light fragrance that leaves a nice moisturizing feel. Nongreasy and non-drying. Another homerun by Dove.</li>
