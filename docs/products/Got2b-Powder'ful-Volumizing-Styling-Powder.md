### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best I&#x27;ve ever used!!  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair silky and smelling awesome.</li>
      <li>and I use this on her when she visits and her hair is just gorgeous!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing !</li>
      <li>this shampoo smells good, cleans great.</li>
      <li>hair smells really good - and not just the day I wash, but for 2 days afterwards.</li>
      <li>But, when it did work, really liked.</li>
      <li>For me, someone very picky about my hair, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used!</li>
      <li>It detangles my hair as it is lathered in, it creates a decent amount of lather and it has a wonderful smell.</li>
      <li>Love it...wish it was available more often!</li>
      <li>i wish there was more.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>This on is our favorite</li>
      <li>Makes my hair smooth and silky and smells HEAVENLY!</li>
      <li>Fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>i have not been able to find in stores any more.</li>
      <li>I love it but wish you would make the shampoo available for purchase also!</li>
      <li>I combine with the other Oil-Licious products for a perfect hair care line!</li>
      <li>But this shampoo made my life easy..</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful, but I soon noticed the effects no longer showed about half way thru the bottle.</li>
      <li>It is not bad when you first wash your hair, smells kinda nice.  </li>
      <li>It comes fast out of the bottle, but I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>so all I really need is just a bit of a light hairspray to keep my bangs from hanging out in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not expensive</li>
      <li>This is pretty close.  </li>
      <li>The price is a bit higher than in the stores</li>
      <li>It really works and defies humidity!</li>
      <li>My hair is super SOFT - making the waves/curls bounce.</li>
      <li>but then the stores sell out if it fast.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend the shampoo though.  </li>
      <li>apparently I didn&#x27;t need it as much as this!  </li>
      <li>I have a normal type of hair with no problems.</li>
      <li>I am 50, so my normally normal/oily hair has changed quite a bit.</li>
      <li>But using this new line of shampoo+conditioner+oil &#x3D;</li>
      <li>I have SUPER DUPER DRY hair.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair silky and soft.  </li>
      <li>Got this for free from the local drug store during black Friday..still regret it.  </li>
      <li>nonetheless, i think its less popular and not easily seen in the shops or online..</li>
      <li>Sister had some in New Orleans when I visited last month.  </li>
      <li>if you have severely DRY hair, very Curly hair, Course hair - give this a try.</li>
      <li>I think African American people would probably like this as it would be very moisturizing to their hair.</li>
      <li>Pretty average shampoo.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, its not as harsh as I&#x27;ve seen it described and has no influence on my decision to use or not use the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would make Oily hair worse and would most likely make thin hair look greasy.</li>
      <li>My hair is one length - down to my waist, and it&#x27;s very course/thick and wavy with curl in it.</li>
      <li>I generally use salon products my stylist recommends for my super thick, chronically dry and somewhat frizzy hair.</li>

<li> My hair is one length - down to my waist, and it&#x27;s very course/thick and wavy with curl in it.</li>
<li> I generally use salon products my stylist recommends for my super thick, chronically dry and somewhat frizzy hair.</li>
<li> I wash my hair every other day because if I wash it more, it dries out even worse and looks horrible.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive online than in one of my stores, but when I can&#x27;t find it anywhere local, finding it on Amazon is a gift.</li>
<li> I have really long hair and tangles</li>
<li> I have dry &amp; curly &amp; frizzy hair.</li>
<li> so if you don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s not a total waste of your money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Does not really foam up.  </li>
<li> It definitely helps with the dryness and frizziness that is my usual.</li>
<li> I have probably spent over $500 in the last 6 months trying to find a shampoo/conditioner that will moisturize my hair without making it dull, heavy, oily looking.</li>
<li> My granddaughter is 5 and half A.A. half Mexican, and she has extremely thick, course, curly black hair</li>
<li> After I use this shampoo and the corresponding conditioner I find that I have much less tangles, my hair feels softer, and it looks healthier.</li>
<li> For those who say it makes their hair too heavy, its probably just their hair type or even water quality.</li>
<li> Feels greasy, heavy..</li>
<li> It does as it says, is what it claims, but way to heavy even for my wavy, colored, &amp; blow dried hair.</li>
<li> Hate it sooooo much, looking for smth  very different now.</li>
<li> Very drying due to the sls, but doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the conditioner.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t need to add any other leave in conditioners, and my use of other products has decreased</li>
<li> Any more then 2x and my hair might look nasty.</li>
<li> just plain yuck!</li>
<li> This company used to make a thick purple shampoo that was just devine.  </li>
<li> don&#x27;t know if I would recommend this for people who have THIN or OILY hair.</li>
<li> I have a terrible feeling that my hair is dirty</li>
<li> That&#x27;s a terrible line of product for me.</li>

    <li> This on is our favorite</li>
    <li> Makes my hair smooth and silky and smells HEAVENLY! I love it but wish you would make the shampoo available for purchase also!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really works and defies humidity! I&#x27;ve been using it on summer months and I don&#x27;t have to use ponytails all the time!</li>
    <li> like it but wouldn&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> It comes fast out of the bottle, but I love this shampoo. It detangles my hair as it is lathered in, it creates a decent amount of lather and it has a wonderful smell. It&#x27;s a little more expensive online than in one of my stores, but when I can&#x27;t find it anywhere local, finding it on Amazon is a gift. It definitely helps with the dryness and frizziness that is my usual.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a terrible line of product for me. I have a normal type of hair with no problems. But using this new line of shampoo+conditioner+oil &#x3D;I have a terrible feeling that my hair is dirty is almost within an hour after wash. Hate it sooooo much, looking for smth  very different now.</li>
    <li> Got this for free from the local drug store during black Friday..still regret it.  It is not bad when you first wash your hair, smells kinda nice.  Does not really foam up.  The problem is about an hour after you wash it.  Feels greasy, heavy..just plain yuck!</li>
    <li> wanted and needed what it pitched, -but apparently I didn&#x27;t need it as much as this!  It does as it says, is what it claims, but way to heavy even for my wavy, colored, &amp; blow dried hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing ! I have dry &amp; curly &amp; frizzy hair. But this shampoo made my life easy.. I tried this with ORS olive oil conditioner.  this combo works for me. nonetheless, i think its less popular and not easily seen in the shops or online..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you should totally give this a try</li>
    <li> i wish there was more. i order 7 but i only received 6 i was so dissappointed. i have not been able to find in stores any more. this shampoo smells good, cleans great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  It leaves my hair silky and soft.  The price is a bit higher than in the stores but then the stores sell out if it fast.  I highly recommend the shampoo though.  It&#x27;s all I will use from now on.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Best I&#x27;ve ever used!!  Sister had some in New Orleans when I visited last month.  Had to get some for myself.</li>
    <li> Love it...wish it was available more often!</li>
    <li> I picked this up on a whim and I&#x27;m so glad. I generally use salon products my stylist recommends for my super thick, chronically dry and somewhat frizzy hair. While I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, its not as harsh as I&#x27;ve seen it described and has no influence on my decision to use or not use the product. For those who say it makes their hair too heavy, its probably just their hair type or even water quality. It happens. For me, someone very picky about my hair, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> This company used to make a thick purple shampoo that was just devine.  This is pretty close.  I like the smell and the way my hair reacts to it.</li>
    <li> Pretty average shampoo. Very drying due to the sls, but doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Worked for a while. Smells wonderful, but I soon noticed the effects no longer showed about half way thru the bottle. But, when it did work, really liked. I&#x27;d say to use it every so often, not daily.</li>
    <li> I have SUPER DUPER DRY hair. I am 50, so my normally normal/oily hair has changed quite a bit. I have probably spent over $500 in the last 6 months trying to find a shampoo/conditioner that will moisturize my hair without making it dull, heavy, oily looking. This is PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;I got both the shampoo &amp; conditioner. I only use it twice a week because it&#x27;s that moisturizing. Any more then 2x and my hair might look nasty. My hair is one length - down to my waist, and it&#x27;s very course/thick and wavy with curl in it. I wash my hair every other day because if I wash it more, it dries out even worse and looks horrible.&lt;br /&gt;My hair smells really good - and not just the day I wash, but for 2 days afterwards. My hair is super SOFT - making the waves/curls bounce. I don&#x27;t need to add any other leave in conditioners, and my use of other products has decreased so all I really need is just a bit of a light hairspray to keep my bangs from hanging out in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend this for people who have THIN or OILY hair. I&#x27;m sure it would make Oily hair worse and would most likely make thin hair look greasy. I think African American people would probably like this as it would be very moisturizing to their hair. My granddaughter is 5 and half A.A. half Mexican, and she has extremely thick, course, curly black hair and I use this on her when she visits and her hair is just gorgeous! She&#x27;s such a Diva!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - if you have severely DRY hair, very Curly hair, Course hair - give this a try. It&#x27;s not expensive so if you don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s not a total waste of your money.&lt;br /&gt;I like it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is my fave shampoo. Leaves my hair silky and smelling awesome. I combine with the other Oil-Licious products for a perfect hair care line!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have really long hair and tangles are a daily problem. After I use this shampoo and the corresponding conditioner I find that I have much less tangles, my hair feels softer, and it looks healthier.</li>
