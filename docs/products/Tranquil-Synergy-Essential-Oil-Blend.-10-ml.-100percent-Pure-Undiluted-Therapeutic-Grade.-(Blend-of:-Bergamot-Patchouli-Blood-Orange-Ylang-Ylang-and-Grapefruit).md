      <li>When I wear it, or even if I just wave the bottle under my nose for a few seconds, I feel happy, calm, beautiful, earthy and, yes, tranquil.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s my thought of the smell: it&#x27;s a earthy, woodsy smell with a strong hint of Patchouli.  </li>
      <li>These oils are an amazing value for the high quality that they are:)</li>
      <li>I purchased this after hearing great things about Plant Therapy from a Essential Oil review site.  </li>

      <li>Delivered quickly w/o any issues.</li>
      <li>shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>The scent is calm and not to overpowering .</li>
      <li>Tranquility so far is my favorite blend from Plant Therapy.  </li>
      <li>I use this every night with a hot rice pack - lulls me right to sleep.</li>
      <li>I am pretty new to oils and am trying different brands this one in diffuser at night or when alot of activity in house it seems so far to keep me in a happy place.</li>
      <li>I use it most w/ vinegar as my fabric softener and in my solid purfume.</li>
      <li>I diffuse this pretty much every night at bedtime.....</li>
      <li>Thanks for a high quality product that&#x27;s consistently helpful!</li>
      <li>A little too sweet for me, however pleasant enough.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it my mental state was sort of like a very light buzz on (beer, weed, etc).  </li>
      <li>you in a very relaxed state.  </li>
      <li>I really like the Plant Therapy brand and will continue to buy their oils</li>
      <li>just very relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really helped create a tranquil environment.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In terms of effect, it really does but</li>
      <li>I have ordered several Plant Therapy essential oils and love them.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I sometimes will add a little of lavender, but that&#x27;s more to mix things up, not because I think it needs it.</li>
      <li>I bought several different kinds, but the Tranquil is by far my favorite.  </li>
      <li>So glad I discovered this brand, quality is great, and it costs so much less than those crazy MLM brands that I refuse to buy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure it helps us sleep any better...</li>
      <li>It smells like Young Living&#x27;s Peace and Calming.  </li>
      <li>If you like the smell of old women in church SWEATING than this product is for you.</li>
      <li>Very soothing scent and long lasting in home.</li>

<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> also a little goes a long way</li>
<li> I actually purchased this because a customer at work walked past me and this heavenly scent found it&#x27;s way to me.</li>
<li> it is earthy but not &amp;#34;real earthy&amp;#34; just enough delicate balance between scents.</li>
<li> Not watered down.</li>
<li> i use it nightly in a diffuser with a little bit of lavender as well.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s too heavy in patchouli for my taste.</li>
<li> quite a few oils from this company .</li>
<li> A few drops on you, in a diffuser, on your pillow or in a spritzer in your room</li>
<li> Unfortuantely my co-workers complained about it</li>
<li> I have ordered from Plant Therapy Essential Oils before and have never been disappointed.</li>
<li> The scent is really weird.</li>
<li> This stuff Stinks!</li>

    <li> So glad I discovered this brand, quality is great, and it costs so much less than those crazy MLM brands that I refuse to buy. Tranquility so far is my favorite blend from Plant Therapy.  I diffuse this pretty much every night at bedtime.....it even seems to relax my pets. I sometimes will add a little of lavender, but that&#x27;s more to mix things up, not because I think it needs it. I got my mom a diffuser for xmas and this is one of the &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; blends I bought for her to introduce her to aromatherapy. It&#x27;s a lovely, relaxing, pleasing scent.</li>
    <li> Just OK...not a lot of aroma.</li>
    <li> I just recently got into essential oils through a coworker.  She was using the much more spending YoungLiving oils.  I jut can not afford that and after doing a of digging, I decided to give the Plant Therapy a shot.  I bought several different kinds, but the Tranquil is by far my favorite.  I will be buying keeping this on hand from now on.  I use it in a diffuser every day.</li>
    <li> Love this oil...relaxing and the scent is wonderful!</li>
    <li> shipped quickly. excellent product. thank you!</li>
    <li> Sadly, I don&#x27;t love this. I really like the Plant Therapy brand and will continue to buy their oils but now this blend. It&#x27;s too heavy in patchouli for my taste. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s a lot more earthy than I anticipated despite the other citrus oils present.</li>
    <li> Love it!! It smells like Young Living&#x27;s Peace and Calming.  I use it every night!</li>
    <li> Very soothing scent and long lasting in home. People say they can smell it before entering the house. Must have more.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I love the blend. I will buy this product again.This company makes a really good product . I&lt;br /&gt;Have quite a few oils from this company .</li>
    <li> If I could give it a zero I would. This stuff Stinks! Ugh. If you like the smell of old women in church SWEATING than this product is for you.</li>
    <li> I am pretty new to oils and am trying different brands this one in diffuser at night or when alot of activity in house it seems so far to keep me in a happy place.</li>
    <li> Love it &amp; all plant therapy Oils! I think I like calming the child a bit more however this one spells much better;) everyone is always saying how great my girls smell. It&#x27;s calming &amp; smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have ordered several Plant Therapy essential oils and love them. I use them to make soaps and bar lotions.</li>
    <li> This oil will be a constant in my diffuser. The scent is calm and not to overpowering . These oils are an amazing value for the high quality that they are:)</li>
    <li> I purchased this after hearing great things about Plant Therapy from a Essential Oil review site.  My thought was that I could use this in my office with a diffuser.  My office is a room, but I leave the door open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my thought of the smell: it&#x27;s a earthy, woodsy smell with a strong hint of Patchouli.  It&#x27;s not the most pleasant smell on the planet, but it&#x27;s not horrible either.  Unfortuantely my co-workers complained about it so I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of effect, it really does but you in a very relaxed state.  I&#x27;d say it my mental state was sort of like a very light buzz on (beer, weed, etc).  Very pleasant but you still have good clarity.  It didn&#x27;t seem to make me feel sleepy, just very relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be great for sleepy time or yoga, but as an office aromatherapy selection, I&#x27;d pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for 30ml by the way.</li>
    <li> I use this every night with a hot rice pack - lulls me right to sleep. Appreciate a natural way to wind down at the end of the day. Thanks for a high quality product that&#x27;s consistently helpful!</li>
    <li> i love this stuff!!  i use it nightly in a diffuser with a little bit of lavender as well.  even my pups love it.  my jack russell terrier (terror) smells it and knows it&#x27;s bedtime.  she snuggles up and goes to sleep.  love it :)</li>
    <li> While my wife and I like the aroma and use it in our bedroom I&#x27;m not sure it helps us sleep any better...lol. also a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Helps relax. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> Another great Plant Therapy blend!</li>
    <li> Try this and sleep better.  A few drops on you, in a diffuser, on your pillow or in a spritzer in your room and you&#x27;ll be snoozing away in no time.  Also works for relaxation.  I take it everywhere with me because I travel.  Natural is the way to go and this is a great company with awesome products to better your life without medications!</li>
    <li> The scent is really weird. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It really helped create a tranquil environment. I used it in th ceramic light bulb rings and everyone kept making comments about how good the house smelled. it is earthy but not &amp;#34;real earthy&amp;#34; just enough delicate balance between scents. Buying more.</li>
    <li> Great essential oil for my diffuser. Not watered down. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Just wish it lingered longer!  Love it!</li>
    <li> A little too sweet for me, however pleasant enough.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this essential oil blend; the scent makes me happy! I use it most w/ vinegar as my fabric softener and in my solid purfume. Delivered quickly w/o any issues. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this because a customer at work walked past me and this heavenly scent found it&#x27;s way to me. I asked her what it was and (thank goodness) she was able to tell me the name of the company and the name of the blend. I came home that night and ordered it immediately. When I wear it, or even if I just wave the bottle under my nose for a few seconds, I feel happy, calm, beautiful, earthy and, yes, tranquil. I will continue to buy this essential oil blend. It is the BEST!</li>
    <li> I have ordered from Plant Therapy Essential Oils before and have never been disappointed. The scents are always really great and as a massage therapist, my clients always give great feedback about them!</li>
    <li> Talk about feeling tranquil! I love the aromatic and medicinal quality of this oil blend! Whenever I feel stressed I inhale the oil and massage it over my feet and ankles.  I get immediate relief, especially since my feet swell after long hours spent sitting and this blend does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil blend would probably last for years.  Although I use it constantly, you only need to apply a few drops at a time so it lasts for a very long time and this is only the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered it since 2013.  This is one of my favorites and essential part of my self-care regimen.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil EVER!! Plant therapy is so speedy in their shipping.  I will definitely be ordering from them again.</li>
