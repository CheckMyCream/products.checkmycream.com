      <li>But these really work!!</li>
      <li>What I found is coupling this with the Original Sprout detangler spray after a shower completely and EASILY takes away the tangles in my kid&#x27;s hair.</li>

      <li>I have two little girls with very long hair and this brush makes for happy mornings :)</li>
      <li>very gentle on the hair, but still detangles.</li>

      <li>it really does work wonders!</li>
      <li>The brush glides straight through my hair and doesn&#x27;t get caught on tangles!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve given this brush 5 stars BUT the color comes off on my hand when I use it, I always have a slight pink tint right where I held the brush. Besides that the brush is amazing and really helps to comb through my 3 yr old daughters long hair without much pain.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush hoping it would help with my daughter&#x27;s tangled hair.  This brush exceeded my expectations!  My 11 year old daughter loves the brush and actually enjoys brushing her hair now.  It had previously been a battle to get her hair brushed!  I&#x27;m going to purchase more of these brushes, I wish I&#x27;d had this brush years ago.</li>
    <li> This brush is a knock off but it&#x27;s better then the real one!!!!!!!! Got the real one at TJ max 2 for the price of  $8. It had an authentic sticker and all. But it worked like a regular wig brush. The &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34;  is 100% better!!!! I&#x27;m returning the real one.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest brush it leaves my hair so manageable. thank you.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my hair. Like I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for my fine hair. I&#x27;ve noticed that it collects less hair, even tough I&#x27;m just as gentle using this brush as I was with my previous brush.</li>
    <li> I received both the purple and blue wet brush on time and they are just what my grandkids wanted. I also ordered the mini wet&lt;br /&gt;Brush and it came on time, they didn&#x27;t like the ugly green color.</li>
    <li> Works great on my granddaughter&#x27;s thick long hair.</li>
    <li> Works well but the bristles quickly got bend and the color stains everything when wet.</li>
    <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever had. My daughter and I have very sensitive scalps and this brush doesn&#x27;t pull our hair. No more tears when I brush my daughter&#x27;s hair. I love this brush! I&#x27;m going to buy this brush for everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I have super tangly hair and was so excited to try this based on the reviews. It does not work well on my hair personally. But works great on my kids.</li>
    <li> As advertised. We used to just use a comb. My daughter loves this, especially because it doesn&#x27;t pull as hard on her curly hair.</li>
    <li> It a decent brush and my 5 year old likes the color, but it does not seem to handle tangles any better than any other brush. I bought the product with high hopes and it did not necessarily meet those expectations. However, I can&#x27;t really complain too much because the price was very reasonable.The product arrived on time and the color was true to picture. If nothing else, my 5 year old was happy to have her own brush.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush!  I have three girls with long hair and this brush eliminates tangles like cutting thru butter!  There is minimal breakage and hair pulled out compared to most other brushes.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This brush works well enough to get the tangles out. Unfortunately once it gets WET (oh, the irony) the paint on the brush rubs off - everywhere. It turned everything in my toiletry bag purple, left marks on my bathroom counter and stained my hands and wrists with an extremely stubborn purple paint that I could not get off for several days. Unbelievably cheap - the handle and back of the brush is now ruined (but won&#x27;t chip completely off) so I&#x27;m forced to throw it away so as not to damage all of my property every time it gets wet - which is supposed to be every time I use it!!! Super disappointed. .</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it and there are less hassles with tangles. Gently removes them!</li>
    <li> Love this brush, I have Psoriasis of the scalp and it is much gentler on my hair and soft on my irritated scalp.</li>
    <li> I have never raved about a brush, but I tell everyone about this brush.  I used to pull a wad of my hair out of my brush every day.  Now I&#x27;m only finding 3 or 4 a day.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well! I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> Not sure how I ever made it this far in my life without this brush! Love It!</li>
    <li> This is a fake Wet Brush.  Buyer Beware!!! The dye of the brush rubbed off everything - hands, counter, and stained.  Do not buy this.  Not a real Wet Brush!</li>
    <li> Love it.  I have thick hair, and was afraid it would be too small or weak for the price.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing brush EVER!!!!  I have bought so many brushes for my daughter and her hair is thin and she has too much hair and a very sensitive scalp and she cried every time. Every day we brush her hair and this is the miracle brush. Amazing and detangles wet and her dry hair and it comes out soft. In love with this. I am getting 2 more to travel and leave at my mom s house which has a pool and her hair tangles very badly there!!! So recommends :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome. My daughter loves it for her hair and now I want one for me</li>
    <li> It does not detangle at all. It goes through without pulling but doesn&#x27;t even do anything. It also smells terrible like a factory and the smell never fades.</li>
    <li> Daughter absolutely loves it</li>
    <li> My daughter hates getting her hair brushed and this is by far the best brush for those in the same boat. We had the egg shaped brush with bristles of different lengths... not so good. This brush has very flexible bristles that won&#x27;t pull on hair. You just have to stroke your hair more to get the knots and tangles out but at least it doesn&#x27;t pull! I bought a second one for our other daughter too. We love this brush!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing!! What used to be a chore (brushing my daughters hair after the bath) now only takes a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Wet brush is amazing. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it. It definitely lives up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush and on the handle it says the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; brush just like that! so obviously this couldn&#x27;t be an authentic wet brush because I ended up buying an authentic one at the store and it was different. I&#x27;m very upset that I wasted my money!</li>
    <li> Love it for myself and bought one for the dog.  Now, it doesn&#x27;t do much for him (soft coated wheaten terrier) except feel good ... so it&#x27;s like the treat before I comb him.</li>
    <li> Bought a second one, I liked it so much</li>
    <li> Works pretty good but leaves my hand purple.</li>
    <li> My Daughter really loves this brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING! Doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair for tangles. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and item was exactly as described. Very happy with this brush.</li>
    <li> Where has this brush been my whole life?? Its seriously that great i never like to write reviews but omg dont look any further. I have tried so many other brushes claiming to not tug and pull or rip my hair out but all have failed excepy this bad boy!! Dont be fooled this brush works wonders i have long and really thick hair so i used to get anxiety just thinking about brushing my hair since it was such a hassle and a bunch of hair would fall off but now i comb it at ease! It runs so smooth! Thank you wet brush!!</li>
    <li> Best hairbrush for our long haired daughter. If your child cries to have hair combed try this one. Works great on wet tangled hair.</li>
    <li> My kid&#x27;s hair is thin and tangles easily, which makes brushing it in the morning a challenge.  This comb makes brushing a lot easier and less painful but is not a miracle brush.  What I found is coupling this with the Original Sprout detangler spray after a shower completely and EASILY takes away the tangles in my kid&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter has long wavy hair and is tender headed.  We bought this on recommendation that it would be gentler, and it seems to be.  She likes her pretty purple hairbrush and complains less about it hurting when I brush her hair.</li>
    <li> Now it&#x27;s easy to brush my snarly crazy hair!!</li>
    <li> My Daughter loves this brush.</li>
    <li> great for long thick hair wet or dry!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I have very long and thick hair. My sister recommended that I get a wet brush for de- tangling. I decided to order one on here. To be honest, when I first used it after using the hair dryer, I was expecting to be no better than any other hair brush. I was wrong, and this really works!! I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does. It&#x27;s a great mystery lol! The brush glides straight through my hair and doesn&#x27;t get caught on tangles! It&#x27;s amazing. The only place it kind of gets stuck a little is the area around my ears. But these really work!! If it can work on my thick, long hair, it can work for you too!!! :)</li>
    <li> Great brush!  I have loooooong and really thin hair!  I brush my hair with this right after my shower and I love it!  And the shipping was super fast!    UPDATE!!!  The colour starts to stain my hands  I&#x27;m trying to upload a Picture but I can&#x27;t :(</li>
    <li> very gentle on the hair, but still detangles.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of this product but was willing to try anything to end the daily post-bath battles with my daughter.  This brush works like a charm.  The bristles are thinner than on other brushes so maybe that makes the difference?  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it works.  I have very thick hair that is color-treated regularly.  This brush even works for me.  Just a few passes over the hair and all the tangles are gone.  Planning to order a second brush so my daughter and I can stop fighting over this one.  Highly recommend; well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have long, very straight, thick hair that&#x27;s thin in texture. I have fought my entire life against tangles. I always joke that if you look at my hair wrong, it&#x27;ll get a knot in it! I picked this up at Target today on a whim and oh my god it&#x27;s so lovely! I wouldn&#x27;t have thought it possible to brush my hair with so little pain! I&#x27;m definitely a fan and this is going in my purse!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best brush I have ever used on my hair when it is wet. It is lightweight and brushes through my thick hair so nicely.  It is a must have!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works wonders with my girl.</li>
    <li> This product really works and with less hair loss than the old brush. Love the color choices too.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product I purchased one for myself and for my 11yr old niece who has very curly hair. The brushes works wonders her mother no longer has to brush her hair for her as it makes it easy and painless for her to do it herself! Very pleased with how fast I received the brushes as well, recommend this buyer and will def. use again in the future! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works wonderful in wet or dry hair! Super light.</li>
    <li> I have this one and the large flat headed one. Best Hairbrush EVER! INCREDIBLY LIGHT,  detangles without any issues. My daughters hated when i had to dry and then brush their wet hair.. with this I don&#x27;t have to worry about anything. I simply comb through their wet hair and let them air-dry. Absolutely love it and am recommending to everyone in the family.</li>
    <li> Love the brush except it turns my hand red/purple</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this comb, no more pain when brushing her hair after a shower.  awesome product.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing.  I have super long, thick and curly hair that tangles easily.  This brush was like a hot knife through butter...so smooth.  No tearing at my hair to get the tangle at.  did not matter if wet or dry, it does the job wonderfully!  I&#x27;m ordering a brush for all my girlfriends!</li>
    <li> This brush is great for all hair types, it easily detangles the most knotted hair with no pain! You can also brush it on dry hair and it works just as well.</li>
    <li> Both my girls love this brush!</li>
    <li> it really does work wonders!</li>
    <li> I should let my ten year old daughter write this review, only then it would look something like this.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!!!!!!! : ) : ) : ) : ) : ))))))))))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is in heaven over this brush, it works wonders on her tangled hair. She has fine long hair, which used to drive both of us crazy with her brushing and whining, but now she does it on her own with no complaints!!!!! So, Five stars all the way!</li>
    <li> Our daughter has very curly hair, this brush is amazing.  It doesnt catch...tug...or pull at her hair.  She even uses it herself to comb her hair now.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this brush to anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever used. I have thick hair and feel no pain when brushing wet or dry hair. I bought another one just to keep in my travel bag so I&#x27;ll always have one.</li>
    <li> If you have little girls you have to have this brush. It brushes out tangles with ease. I have two little girls with very long hair and this brush makes for happy mornings :)</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic brush.  I have bought it in other colors for different children.  I love this color!  It came super fast and very well packaged.  I want to update my review on this brush.  I just purchased a new one in silver. It is not nearly as good as the first one I had or the others I bought in the past.  Something is different about this one. It tears more at my hair and scratches my scalp.  On my old one the tips began to come off and when too many were worn away it actually hurt!</li>
    <li> Great product. fast shipper</li>
    <li> Really nice hairbrush that lives up to the hype. My hair is very thick so it&#x27;s good to have a brush that I know won&#x27;t ruin my lovely locks.</li>
    <li> Great brush but got wet and a pink color bled all over my bathroom counter. I was freaked out ! And thought it was pink all over my hand to but brush is great and super prompt shipping love it. Keep away from mouthwash and astringents.</li>
    <li> My daughter just loves this brush and tends to look forward to brushing her hair since it arrived! Well worth it for your wee ones.</li>
    <li> I use this brush for my kids&#x27; long hair and it works great.  Brushes through the tangles fairly easily and doesn&#x27;t create a lot of static.</li>
    <li> Love this have been wanting to get this brush for a while for my daughter works great she loves this brush no pulling at all!! I wished the I bought a few a them for all the girls in the house!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, but as others have said, the bristles are coming out.  So it&#x27;s a toss-up ... how long will it last?  In the meantime, dear daughter&#x27;s hair isn&#x27;t tangly and she can now brush it herself.  Wish it weren&#x27;t falling apart so soon (less than 2 weeks).</li>
    <li> Amazing! This brush makes you feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I bought  this brush at my hair salon.  Of course paid more than I should have,  but I don&#x27;t regret it.  The brush leaves my hair so soft. I don&#x27;t get the horrible knots in the back and interior area of my hair.  Instead it is so silky. I naturally have a wavy fine hair, very easy to get dry and tangled up. The brush was my solution.  I carry  it everywhere!</li>
    <li> Favorite hair brush. I have now bought four of theses brushes. Enough said they work.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. Works so well. I told all my pals about it. NO more snags.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my granddaughter and one for myself. My granddaughter has very difficult hair to comb through when wet. I thought I had tried everything, and nothing seemed to do the trick. This brush was such a godsend! It works great... no more tears! I love it for my hair as well. Great product!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! I have long thick hair and this helps immensely. 4 stars given because the color (while pretty) bleeds when wet! This is a WET brush! I brushed my WET hair and left it on the counter and it bled onto the counter and left a stain</li>
