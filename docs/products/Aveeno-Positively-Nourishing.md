      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>

      <li>I can finally get a good night&#x27;s sleep without bailing out of bed to \\&quot;stop the itching.\\</li>
      <li>Too sweet smelling for my taste.</li>
      <li>I can partake of the full sensory experience that is this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not greasy at all and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>It cleared up my son&#x27;s eczema quickly and it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quick absorption and</li>
      <li>this packaging is easy to use, very portable (fits into your traveling case or handbag) and most of all the fragrance is absolutely devine.  </li>
      <li>I read a review of this product on a beauty blog that gave it high marks, I am glad I decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>Generally, this is my favorite lotion (Aveeno products are fantastic).</li>
      <li>This product not only has a pleasant smell, but it certainly improved my arms.</li>
      <li>I typically steer clear of any scented products but the scent of this lotion is just wonderful -</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m an avid fan of Aveeno lotions...</li>
      <li>I LOVE the way this Aveeno lotion smells, I am a big fan of lavendar.  </li>
      <li>and it truely helps her skin stay soft and silky as babies skin should be.</li>
      <li>EXTREMELY HAPPY that Amazon sells it for A LOT less for TWO bottles compared to the local grocery store when it&#x27;s on sale!!  </li>
      <li>It realy does wonders and keeps your skin smooth and delicate :)</li>
      <li>The lavender aroma is intoxicating and very relaxing.</li>
      <li>The 2 products are very close in scent</li>
      <li>Plus the lotion works really well.  </li>
      <li>I am getting ready to place another order for it as I plan to put a tube in my mother&#x27;s birthday gift basket.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d snap up a matching body butter, body splash, shampoo, and conditioner so fast, and I bet others would, too.</li>
      <li>I searched for it here and found that it was reasonably price</li>
      <li>Aveeno Positively Nourishing Calming Lotion is by far</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and sinks into your skin.</li>
      <li>Good product but stopped buying it for the family after discovering from a PETA list that Aveeno tests all ingredients on defenseless animals.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>After you see a video of such ingredients dropped into the eyelid less eyes of rabbits you wonder why we would inflict such atrocities on animals just so we don&#x27;t have to rub our own eyes..  </li>
      <li>This Aveeno lotion product is not the same as the lotion in the large pump bottle that advertises as stress relief scent as has ylang ylang scent.</li>
      <li>That is a big sign this product is an imposter and not the real deal.</li>
      <li>smells fantastic and is not too heavy</li>
      <li>Bought for a friend for a present and she absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>Please get the real stuff back Amazon.</li>
      <li>It also leaves skin feeling the same as with any other Aveeno product - smooth, moisturized, but not greasy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Positively Nourishing Calming Lotion for at least 3 years and I like it very much.  </li>
      <li>My skin might just be that dry though, which is something new to me.</li>
      <li>No dry skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Positively Nourishing Calming Lotion for at least 3 years and I like it very much.  I hope I can continue to order it through Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend for a present and she absolutely loves it. Smells nice but not overpowering</li>
    <li> I use this lotion on my infant daughter, it&#x27;s light scent is great and it truely helps her skin stay soft and silky as babies skin should be. I have tried many types/brands of lotions and continue to return to Aveeno brand lotions. I also use this lotion for my face and body and love it&#x27;s quick absorption and how amazing it makes my skin!</li>
    <li> smells fantastic and is not too heavy</li>
    <li> great moisturizer and leave a lovely lavender scent</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth and sinks into your skin. You feel so silky and has a nice smell.I use it every day.No dry skin.</li>
    <li> Too sweet smelling for my taste. I probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m what you might call a scent addict: I love discovering new, beautiful scents, but I also like it when scents transport me to a cherished memory.  In this case, the lotion smells like fresh, clean laundry, and that makes me think of warm weather, sunshine, bunnies in the backyard, and my husband, who always smelled of fabric softener when I first met him.  : )  But don&#x27;t get the wrong idea: this isn&#x27;t a detergent-type freshness; it&#x27;s incredibly relaxing and peaceful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it before bed last night, and I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing my hands.  : D  My husband loves it, too, and he&#x27;s actually the reason why I tried it.  He used to use the accompanying body wash, which I also recommend, and since we had an extra bottle, I thought I&#x27;d start using it, as well, but I wanted the matching lotion.  I&#x27;m looking forward to my next shower, so I can partake of the full sensory experience that is this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I ordered some (it&#x27;s now on our Subscribe &amp; Save rotation, since I don&#x27;t want to ever run out).  I&#x27;m going to put some in a travel-sized bottle, so I can take it with me everywhere!  This is one of my all-time favorite scents--no exaggeration there at all!  I also love that it absorbs quickly, it isn&#x27;t greasy, and it leaves my skin ridiculously soft.  Did I mention that it smells absolutely fabulous?  : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone from Aveeno&#x27;s marketing team is reading this review, I think you all should expand the line.  I&#x27;d snap up a matching body butter, body splash, shampoo, and conditioner so fast, and I bet others would, too.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and has a nice scent that is not overpowering with chamomile and lavender. This Aveeno lotion product is not the same as the lotion in the large pump bottle that advertises as stress relief scent as has ylang ylang scent. The 2 products are very close in scent but I prefer the stress relief scent better. The calming lotion is nice for travel as it has a flip top.</li>
    <li> The only lotion I use. There&#x27;s a big difference between artificial lavender scent and real lavender. The lotion smells great, and is really calming. Absorbs easily without greasy residue.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. It&#x27;s being discontinued so I bought a bunch. Delivered in record time.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong. I&#x27;m a nurse and I wash my hands a lot. This lotion is definitely a good deal.</li>
    <li> Aveeno Positively Nourishing Calming Lotion is by far my favorite lotion I&#x27;ve used. I typically steer clear of any scented products but the scent of this lotion is just wonderful - it&#x27;s light, lovely, and not at all overpowering. It also leaves skin feeling the same as with any other Aveeno product - smooth, moisturized, but not greasy. I have a hard time finding this in stores but I will definitely continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent body lotion.  I ended up having to use a lot of it to get the desired moisturized feeling to my skin.  My skin might just be that dry though, which is something new to me. I have always used body lotion every night after showering before bed but have recently noticed my arms and legs needing lotion again through the day.  The lavender aroma is intoxicating and very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I love the smell  of this and Aveeno is the best lotion around.  Once applied it you are covered for 24 hrs.</li>
    <li> Love Aveeno products and the fragrance is terrific.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great and is very calming. Both me and my husband use it before bed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since it day it came out. I use it everynight on my hands before bed. Makes your hands smooth, helps you relax and smells beautiful. Great for your feet too</li>
    <li> i bought this cream in America and loved it.  so pleased I was able to order it online. looking forward to be able to replace it when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Love the light fragrance, but would really like to see it come out in cream form........Does keep moisturizing for a long time.......:0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came  well within the deadline.........:0)</li>
    <li> I LOVE the way this Aveeno lotion smells, I am a big fan of lavendar.  Plus the lotion works really well.  I put it on right before I go to bed as part of my process for getting relaxed.  I will continue to purchase this lotion, as it&#x27;s now a staple in my routine.</li>
    <li> Recommending to it patients and members who need calming-lovely scent which definitely helps the cause!&lt;br /&gt;drkimsagewellsolutions</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid fan of Aveeno lotions... this packaging is easy to use, very portable (fits into your traveling case or handbag) and most of all the fragrance is absolutely devine.  It&#x27;s best used at nights where it gives you a calming effect just before drifting off into dreamland.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased to have discovered this product! I can&#x27;t get over the relief it has brought my skin. Was battling Eczema. This product not only has a pleasant smell, but it certainly improved my arms. I can finally get a good night&#x27;s sleep without bailing out of bed to \\&quot;stop the itching.\\&quot; This product stopped the itching and is clearing up the Eczema. Thank you, Aveeno!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this lotion!!  EXTREMELY HAPPY that Amazon sells it for A LOT less for TWO bottles compared to the local grocery store when it&#x27;s on sale!!  I have dry skin on my hands.  This lotion moisturizes them nicely and does not leave them feeling greasy at all.  I use this lotion daily on my hands, legs, and arms.  I just hope Amazon keeps them at this great price ($9.94) for two bottles for awhile.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin and this is one of the few moisturizing lotions that don&#x27;t irritate her skin.</li>
    <li> Good product but stopped buying it for the family after discovering from a PETA list that Aveeno tests all ingredients on defenseless animals.  After you see a video of such ingredients dropped into the eyelid less eyes of rabbits you wonder why we would inflict such atrocities on animals just so we don&#x27;t have to rub our own eyes..  Trader Joes makes a comparable product which isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Generally, this is my favorite lotion (Aveeno products are fantastic). However, the last couple times I&#x27;ve received this through Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save, the lotion has been thinner than usual, the smell isn&#x27;t quite the same, and the seal has been missing from the lid. As in, you open the lid and there&#x27;s the lotion without the foil seal. Anytime you buy this product at Target or any other grocery store, it has a seal. That is a big sign this product is an imposter and not the real deal. Just cancelled this from my subscribe and save. Please get the real stuff back Amazon.</li>
    <li> love it keep my skin soft</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Very soothing!</li>
    <li> This lotion does feel good on the skin, but the odor could stop a train. JUST SAY NO to this nasty smelling product.</li>
    <li> Everytime I use this lavendar-scented product I remind myself to buy some more before I run out.  It is for over-all body use.  I use it nightly on my arms, hands and feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to get more for the people I work with.  Not greasy at all and dries quickly.  Love the tingle and the scent.</li>
    <li> It cleared up my son&#x27;s eczema quickly and it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.  The scent is light and pleasant!  We will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I saw this item reccomended in one of Real Simple&#x27;s newsletters.  I started looking for it and could not find it in any of the local stores.  I searched for it here and found that it was reasonably price and there was free shipping.  I ordered 2 of them and I love it.  It smells great and feels so good.  I am getting ready to place another order for it as I plan to put a tube in my mother&#x27;s birthday gift basket.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works all day.  I read a review of this product on a beauty blog that gave it high marks, I am glad I decided to give it a try.  I ride a vespa to work and have very dry hands in the winter and this has completely cured my cracking dry knuckles.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Quality lotion. Goes on smooth and is not greasy. Matches the quality of Bath and Body Works and Victoria Secret lotions.</li>
    <li> Smells like lavender, too!  I love it so much that I order it in bulk!  Not only calming but it&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Works great just like the big bottle of the same lotion, only more portable.&lt;br /&gt;For those unfamiliar with this lotion, it is a light lotion that rubs in nicely and does a great job of moisturizing. It smells great too!&lt;br /&gt;The cap is what you need to watch on portable items and this cap is strong and \\&quot;drip-less.\\&quot; Super handy!</li>
    <li> Great lotion. I have psoriasis and this lotion sooths my skin and makes it a lot better. For best effect apply the lotion right after a shower. It realy does wonders and keeps your skin smooth and delicate :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definatly recommend to anyone looking for a good skin lotion</li>
