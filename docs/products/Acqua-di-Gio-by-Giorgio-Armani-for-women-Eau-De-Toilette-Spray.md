      <li>and that is exactly how this smelt as soon as i got it.</li>
      <li>REPLICA OF THE REAL THING!</li>
      <li>It would be better if it were longer lasting.</li>
      <li>fragrance very short-lived.</li>
      <li>I was fortunate to get my money back.</li>
      <li>You do not have to use much either.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 10 years and I love it.  Recently I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding it.</li>
    <li> Has the smell that I remember</li>
    <li> smells great on my girlfriend..  this fragrance caught my attention as i walked by another woman passing in a hallway - i had to ask her what it was..not dissapointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself when I saw the awesome price on Amazon and was really please with the scent and quality of the product.  But then again you can not go wrong with anyhing by Armani.  Super product at a great price.  Much less than the highn end stores its carried in.  Once again Amazon I am pleased</li>
    <li> Armani developed a winner with this one.  Light, floral, slightly beachy -- makes me think of summer year-round.  I&#x27;m forever getting compliments on it!  It isn&#x27;t overpowering like many scents out there.  Wish it were easier to get the skin lotion instead of having to buy the gift set.</li>
    <li> I purchaced this Acqua Di Gio for Women as a birthday gift for my wife. She absolutely loves the fragrance as do I. It was a hit! Amazons price with free shipping coupled with no tax made the price unbeatable. So far Amazon has always been able to deliver my free shipping items ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> My fav for 20 years yes it&#x27;s been around a long time and hard to find</li>
    <li> Excellent perfume.  Hard to find in stores near us and my wife likes it.</li>
    <li> It had been a long time since I wore this perfume.  I can&#x27;t seem to find it in department stores. Very satisfied, Thanks!</li>
    <li> i love it! and so do other people they tell me how good it smells i&#x27;m very happy with!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend for christmas &#x27;10. She loves it and wears it all the time. Highly recommend to any guys that wants to be in their girls good graces.</li>
    <li> OMG I LOVE this perfume. It smells like heaven. Big bottle - Great deal - So happy!!</li>
    <li> Great price on a hard to find fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love how this opens, and I sensed musk and vodka straight away at the top without knowing the listed notes. Unfortunately, this is turning sweet on me, too sweet. And the white florals aren&#x27;t right for me. Too bad too - love the opening otherwise. Have to scrub - the white florals are just too irritating for me. (PS - I often have this reaction to white florals, particularly with CK &amp; Givenchy. Armani joins that list.)</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume.  The price is good on Amazon.  I recommend this perfume because it has a fresh scent.</li>
    <li> some perfumes get that been sitting on the shelf too long smell and that is exactly how this smelt as soon as i got it. would not buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I loved Gio &amp; since that is not available anymore, this is the next best perfume for me! Every time I wear it I get many compliments! I can&#x27;t describe the smell except to say heavenly!! My opinion. It is not a heavy overpowering perfume. Just very nice! Arrived promptly &amp; in one piece. That is the way I like it.</li>
    <li> Who says this is a woman&#x27;s perfume. I use it and everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> This product was not the real perfume. It smelt completely different than the real perfume from macys.</li>
    <li> Its a smooth, fine, pleasing scent. It would be better if it were longer lasting.</li>
    <li> As you can see I ordered the Armani for WOMAN. I received the Armani for MEN. It turned out that my son enjoyed the fragrence so I gave it to him. It did mean that I had to reorder the product and have it sent directly to my daughter, as this was a Christmas Present, and hope the RIGHT product arrived.  They like the scent, I just didn&#x27;t plan to order two of them.</li>
    <li> So excited to get it at a great price without having to fight the traffic to get there, the parking craziness at the outlet mall perfume store, or the heat! Great service!</li>
    <li> I am generally not a big fan of these light, crisp, fresh fragrances, but Acqua Di Gio isn&#x27;t half bad. The scent is floral, but also refreshing, without being too beachy. I don&#x27;t think the staying power is that great, but the scent alone is nice.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the price because I was getting twice the perfume for a price that everyone else was charging for the 1.7 oz bottle.  It came on time and in new condition.  I love the scent and I will order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Very sensual fragrance , light but distinctive, good for day or night. I get a lot of compliments when I wear this fragrance, it also lasts along time. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> the perfect gift for that special someone in your life</li>
    <li> Very light, great for summer. Fresh. I adore it.</li>
    <li> If you love a clean fragrance this is definitely the perfume.... Wonderful scent for the summer or spring...  Acqua lasts all day.....</li>
    <li> Not to my expectations</li>
    <li> I was slightly concerned to turn the bottle over a few days ago and notice that the serial # had been clearly cut off with a sharp knife.  Hmmm.</li>
    <li> I am super picky when it comes to scents! When I say picky I mean it... I like sweet, but it can&#x27;t be too sweet. Hate strong smells, hate most floral scents. I don&#x27;t know how I managed to get a collection as big as I have of perfume. This is the newest to my collection and boy does it smell amazing. Not too strong. The scent smells like blueberries and flowers, but it&#x27;s light. It is a sweet, fresh smell. So pleased I picked this up. Also got a bottle for my aunts 65th birthday and she also loves it. This goes to show that this works for women of all ages (I am less than half her age for reference.) Do not recommend for women that like very strong bold scents. Beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell. I guess it was my fault for not sampling this scent before purchasing it, but in my defense, I was going off of what everyone said on Fragrantica and reviews on here. It smells extremely powdery and old-lady-like. No offense. It&#x27;s a very mature smell. Not aquatic at all...I honestly hated it. I didn&#x27;t get compliments on it either, like what anyone else claimed. I actually got remarks like &amp;#34;Ew, what is it you&#x27;re wearing?&amp;#34;. It was a lot worse of a smell than what I expected. Very disappointed, but I&#x27;ve learned my lesson. If you like powdery smells, get it. However, if you&#x27;re expecting a female version of Acqua di Gio, it really doesn&#x27;t smell anything like citrus or the ocean. Buy at your own risk!</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. nice clean scent</li>
    <li> I bought this gift for my mother-in-law and she was extremely dissatified with it.</li>
    <li> I smelled this as a sample in a magazine and thought it smelled amazing. Very happy I purchased this, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use the Acqua Di Gio for Men, and it&#x27;s great. The fragrance lasts all day, but the one for women was a real disappointment...fragrance very short-lived.</li>
    <li> My fave perfume of all time...sweet, mild, sexy.</li>
    <li> Have brought this for several years, has a hint of lily of the valley flowers,a gentle warm smell. Lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Item arrived as expected and on time</li>
    <li> HATE IT! SMELLS LIKE OLD LADY PERFUME, NOT THE SMELL IM USED TO! REPLICA OF THE REAL THING! NOT REAL! DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> THIS ACQUA DI GIO FOR WOMEN IS THE ORIGIONAL.  NOT A KNOCK OFF AS SOME CLAIM.  BEAUTIFUL, FRESH AND CLEAN SCENT.  LONG LASTING BUT NOT OVER POWERING.  I WILL PURCHASE MY PURFUMES WITH CONFIDENCE FROM AMAZON AGAIN, AS I HAVE MADE TWO FRAGRANCE PURCHASES RECENTLY AND I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH BOTH.</li>
    <li> I love the scent ,  very light and clean.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume for years. It is getting hard to find because they came out with a new fragrance and are slowly discontinuing this one. I found it here for the same price as a bottle half it&#x27;s size in the retail store!</li>
    <li> Today was my first day even knowing this fragrance existed, lol! I usually like fruity type body splashes but omg this stuff smells sooo good.</li>
    <li> Smells completely horrible</li>
    <li> Gift and she loves it. They no longer sell this fragrance in dept stores</li>
    <li> I purchased item this for my wife, and my wife discovered after opening it that it was likely a knockoff.  It was in a similar bottle, but it was not exactly the same and the smell of the perfume was nothing like authentic Acqua di Gio.  Although my wife loves Acqua di Gio perfume, I would never order this product again from Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I love it and I love the fact that it got to me very quickly! This is my fav eau de toilette</li>
    <li> This is one of the only fragrances that usually lasts all day and even the next and I have tons of different perfumes of all types. This one smells the same but lasts about a half an hour. I cant get it anymore at Sephora so I tried this. I think its a knock off or something. Oh well, I&#x27;ll still use it.</li>
    <li> It is my perfum for 21 years....</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift, liked by the receiver.</li>
    <li> Arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> When i bought this perfume not imagine that it would be so good and so original, so I invite you to buy it.</li>
    <li> She loves it.  I bought a bottle back on 2000 when we got married and she hadn&#x27;t find it locally.  Got it for her on our 15th anniversary.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. .. reminds me of the tropics.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years, the bottle that I bought this week is the same, real stuff. I carefully examined the packaging, bottle, codes, etc, before spraying, but when I did I knew immediately it was real. Good price, fast shipping, amazon seller. All is well.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t speak for the men&#x27;s version......</li>
    <li> Not huge fan of the smell, kind of smells like an old lady</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it arrived within a week and it was new and was exactly what I ordered.  Thnank you!!</li>
    <li> Owned this product for years and its a great product that not over powering .Try it and i,am sure you will like it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s original.Smell doesn&#x27;t stay for a long time.Very disappointed with this perfume.Smells like  jasmine flower which makes a headache.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. Get compliments each time I wear it.</li>
    <li> This product is great as I expected it to be. I am very happy with this product and probably will order it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume - been wearing it forever - in my opinion, there is not another perfume like it!</li>
    <li> i bought this perfume for my mom  and they are fake im so mad about this. dissapointed TOTally!!!! please check out</li>
    <li> prompt delivery, very well received as gift.</li>
    <li> The only fragrance I wear. It&#x27;s clean and crisp. Wish I could still get it everywhere.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Acqua di Gio Eau De Toilette for women at least ten years.  I suffer from allergies, and I can&#x27;t wear a lot of perfumes.  Yet, this perfume has  never adversely effected my allergies.  I get a lot of compliments too.  I think the Acqua di Gio Eau De Toilette has a much better smell than the Acqua di Gio Eau De Parfum for women.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume. It&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore so I was overjoyed when I came across it on Amazon. I am completely satisfied with my order. It came in a timely manner and it smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that complained of a fake, however mine was the real deal.</li>
    <li> I really like this scent, and it lasts all day!  You do not have to use much either.  So, a bottle this size lasts a very long time!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and was really sad when they stopped selling it at department stores.  I was nervous to buy it online because of reading reviews that suggested the fragrance could be fake, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  I bought a bottle from amazon and one from another website and they seem to smell the same.  I can&#x27;t compare them to the scent I used to buy in department stores because I don&#x27;t have any left, but I&#x27;m happy with the scent, and even happier that I can buy it online and not have to find a new spring-summer perfume.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  Fresh and light.  Not  too overpowering.  I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great summer scent..</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed. I bought this thinking it would smell just like the roller ball perfume I got at ulta. This product came days later than anticipated, and it was a fake. Please do not waste your time purchasing this item. I made the mistake of not reading the reviews and got screwed with a fake $65 bottle of crap.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real thing. It smells differently.</li>
    <li> A super product! Have used it for years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether this item is the authentic one, I owned this scent years ago. Purchased it at Macy&#x27;s and loved it. I saw it on Amazon and decided to try it again, however, the actual box for the fragrance that arrived had part of the bar code missing with a random label placed over the bar code. I thought to myself that&#x27;s strange. Overall it smells okay, but the scent does not last for long.</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years. It is the BEST ever. You can wear it ALL the time, no matter what the season.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, it smells excellent, light fresh and a little sweet scent, very pleasant. I am using a 2nd bottle already.</li>
    <li> My friend told me she&#x27;d really love this smell. She will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased Acqua Di Gio for women. I opened the box and the bottle was dirty. The labeled was coming off and the top was plastic. I paid $67.00 for this bottle. I was fortunate to get my money back. JUST FAKE!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was so very disappointed when I received this today.  I have worn this scent for years.  This is not Acqua Di Gio.  In fact, it smells really bad.  I will never order a fragrance on line again after this transaction.  This was a waste of my hard earned dollar.  I have used Amazon heavily for years.  I have never had a bad experience until today.</li>
    <li> I know there are several other perfumes out there that are way more expensive, but I still think it&#x27;s a lot of money to spend.  Fortunately, this size bottle lasts me at least six months and I use it just about every day.  I&#x27;ve been using this same perfume for over 17 years so that&#x27;s got to say something!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I LOVE my husbands Acqua Di Gio... I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  I bought a 70$ bottle and hated the smell and when I went to return it, it was non-returnable. Don&#x27;t buy this before smelling it in an actual store.</li>
