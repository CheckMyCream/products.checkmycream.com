<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first tried this product when my hair stylist recommended it to me. When he stopped carrying it, I was really sad because it works wonders for my extremely curly, thick hair. It provides shine and moisture without making you look oily--although, don&#x27;t put too much on or else you will end up achieving that effect. Great product, I am so glad I found it for an awesome price!</li>
    <li> An absolute must buy. Made such a noticeable difference to my hair as soon as I applied it. Felt soft. Gave it an amazing left wen blow dried. Love it!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! Works great and smells good too.</li>
    <li> the stylist who cut my hair used this on me, it smelled great and when my hair dried, it wasnt frizzy at all and it looked so shiny. i have naturally curly, very curly, hair and im always trying new products. i hate the crunchy, wet look, so im very happy to say this doesnt do that. i use a defrizz serum also before i use the Hydrocreme and i just love it! im back to buy more!</li>
    <li> This smells like Heaven!!! :) Well at least that is what I say to myself EVERY time I put this cream in my hair and catch a good long whiff! Currently my favoritestest scent to wear on my hair! I can&#x27;t stop smelling it on myself! Now as a cream it is good stuff but a little goes a long way so use it gently because you don&#x27;t want to use too much and have your hair weighed down and feeling gross</li>
    <li> This hair product left my hair smoother and more tamed.  Nice scent and easy to use, but don&#x27;t overdo it.  I&#x27;m sure, like anything else, some hair types will respond better than others.  I liked it, would buy it again and will recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Pretty good hold.</li>
    <li> Great product that works and smells great. I absolutely love it and I am very pleased with this purchase. My teenager has stole this bottle so I will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use product in my hair but this last time when I went in my stylist used some on my curly hair and it was amazing!! I never get my curls to look like that even though I use the right blow drier and have experimented with other products in the past. It does an amazing job of not looking either greasy or crunchy, finally!! And it smells delicious!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells as good as the rest of the line &amp; along with the hydromist blow out spray a great combination. Love this whole line.</li>
    <li> This product is great for volume and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need just a tiny bit less then a quarter size as a little goes a long way and too much will make you look like you forgot to rinse the shampoo from your hair. But it is great once you get the knack of it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this and now it is the only styling product I use.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> She&#x27;s used this for a year or more, can&#x27;t remember exactly, and she really likes the control and feel.  Sorry I am not a hair care marketing expert, but if she likes it, it must be ok.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! People comment on how my hair smells so fresh. I have fine slightly curly hair and this product gives me body without weighing my hair down and helps me control frizz. A little of this product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Good price and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cream. It has the best smell.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mousse.  You only need a tiny bit.  It smells awesome!  I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mousse.  It smells nice and has enough tackiness to keep my fine hair alive all day.  I was nervous about it shipping, but I&#x27;ve always been happy.  It arrives well-protected, taped-shut, and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my hair every single day. I appreciate it for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down&lt;br /&gt;It eliminates frizz</li>
    <li> This is the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever tried for Curley hair.  It gives your hair body &amp; curl without making it stif or sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this product it helps my hair stay calm... and I have alot of hair. I would suggest this to anyone that has curley or wavey hair.</li>
    <li> Good for curly hair and much cheaper than in salon! Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> It was a good thing I kept the old can! This one arrived with the top split! It would have been a mess the whole time I used it!</li>
    <li> I have thin straight hair with a little natural wave.  I use this product without any other product and my hair looks good enough to wear around work.  Cuts the frizz, keeps all in place, and doesn&#x27;t grease my oily hair out.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.  It starts to change consistency at the end of the bottle (higher concentration less air) i think.  But it is still usable, just have to use a little less.  If I had to choose one product out of hair and makeup only to have for the rest of my life I would choose this product and like most women, I could own a house with the money i have spent on beauty products.</li>
    <li> Like many hair products for curls i found this to enhance my curls but also leave a residue on my hair that never dried. It smell wonderful but throughout the day if i touched my hair at all i had to wash my hands. I tried using less product but did not think it made a difference. It didn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy which was great but i could not recommend this because of the residue it left on my hair when i used it.</li>
    <li> It holds hair without giving it a heavy appearance. It smells really good and gives hair a shiny look. I think it does the job just like Pantene Pro-V Silky Moisture Whip, which is cheaper. But both are amazing!</li>
    <li> this is such a great product! not only does it do a really good job of fighting frizz but it also SMELLS AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by a stylist where I went to have my hair done for my son&#x27;s wedding. I decided to buy some and see if I liked it. Well I love it. I have naturally curly hair, I wear it short. This keeps my hair in check but does not give it a &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feel like some gels. It is a mousse and I used this container for two months, daily. That is great value. It has a pleasant fragrance and is easily applied.</li>
    <li> Love this product; best mousse on the market; others make hair feel dry; this conditions your hair beautifully.  Purchased three times so far; unavailable in retail stores as far as I have found.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product ever! Keeps my frizz manageable and curls soft while providing a light to medium hold. Smells amazing and I can&#x27;t live without this product. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I use this product in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner!  It is very thick like whipping cream so a little goes a long way.  Great for a style that lasts!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this product!  Hair smells great the entire day also and is light weight.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair. This product is so far the best I have used for styling. Without this my hair is goes flat very quickly.</li>
    <li> Gives good curl definition without the crunchiness so so many products.  Very moisturizing, and still have good volume .  I have extremely thick wavy/curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff.  It smells like you&#x27;ve died and gone to heaven.  It always makes my hair look nice too.</li>
    <li> Review written by Carolyn Bragg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Mom loves this product for the hold and absence of ickyness (that some mousses have). And she really likes the scent!  High praise from a woman that is sensitive to most fragrances and is easily overcome by way-too-much fragrance!</li>
    <li> Use this as a volumizer before blow drying.  Easy to use whip and mix in hair.  Holds nicely and isn&#x27;t too sticky</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  It conditions, adds volume, and has a very pleasant (non-offensive) smell to it.  It makes your hair feel so soft. I have hair that is both permed and colored which this product is perfect for.  The extra conditioning helps keep my hair in great shape.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> My wife &amp;#34;loves&amp;#34; this product and I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; the price I pay for it for her!</li>
    <li> Great smell and product feels nice on hair. Does not make hair too puffy as some products do.</li>
    <li> I was worried that I was going to run out given the bottle is not that big, but you only need a little moose so this can will last me a long time!</li>
    <li> i have dry, thick hair and this makes it so smooth and soft. Im praying that paul mitchell never discontinues it!</li>
    <li> This works like a mousse on your hair but it doesn&#x27;t disappear in your hands when you activate it - it is firmer and does&lt;br /&gt;the job.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product a couple of years now. This product give my hair body after blow drying and the smell is divine! It come out of the can as it states, a whip. Wonderful volumizing product!</li>
    <li> This Paul Mitchell line is really wonderful. The hydrocream whip smells great, adds volume to my hair, and is super easy to use. I highly recommend it. Plus, who doesn&#x27;t love the name?</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Hydrocream is th best styling product I have used..</li>
    <li> this is my favorite product for my curly hair.  I used to use 2-3 products to get my desired look, now just this one product! awesome.</li>
    <li> Perfection! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this! Leave hair very soft with soft hold, AND THE SMELL!!!!!!!!!! If you ever were a fan of Back To Basics Ginger Therapy Line, IT&#x27;S THE SAME SCENT! And it lingers in your hair so you can smell this awesome gingery scent all day long! It&#x27;s heaven in a can!</li>
    <li> Rich and luxurious feel to it. Does seem to hydrate my hair. Use lightly when using it and allowing your hair to air dry or it may have a wet look to it. Over all good product and good hold.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff. It came quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Paul Mitchell always runs true on their promise for their items.  Smells wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this line of products. I have a lot of very fine highlighted hair that is very straight. The only bad thing I can say about this whip is that it seems to be a bit heavy for my kind of hair. I think someone with hair that isn&#x27;t quite as fine would really appreciate using this. Other than that it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and does give a bit of texture to my hair.</li>
    <li> Leave my hair soft and manageable. I have curly hair and it tames all the frizz, my hair has never looked better</li>
    <li> My hair is coarse and thick, and there are many mousse products I cannot use.  This one, I can. Gives me a bit of body and lift right where I need it, and lasts til the next wash.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this when I told him I desperately needed something for dry winter hair.  I received this right away after ordering and it actually helps keep my thin, flyaway hair from flying all over the place.  Best part is I can wet my hair between shampoos, use the hydrocream and dry my hair and it looks good.  Best part is the fantastic smell.  I love it.</li>
    <li> ...dry, damaged, aging, coarse, processed then this &#x27;mousse&#x27; may be for you!  It allows for styling AND softness.  It is so expensive I wanted to cry and die, but worth it for my hair not to feel dry, coarse, frizzy, and crunchy.  I love it.  So, I pay the price...</li>
    <li> Nothing great about this mousse.  It has no real &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; to it and didn&#x27;t keep down frizz.  It wasn&#x27;t horrible either...didn&#x27;t make hair sticky or anything, but just was like using nothing.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and the cost is below what I pay in my Salon.  An excellent product with good results.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair. I have tried a wide variety of products and oils to tame my frizz while keeping my bouncy curls. Most make my hair hard and crusty. This bottle is doesn&#x27;t! It gets rid of my frizz and keeps my curls intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a tiny amount, and it works wonders on my intense curls!! I love it ðŸ˜„</li>
    <li> Not the healthiest ingredients in the world, but this is one of the few styling products out there that can really handle my mixed-texture hair - wavy but fine, frizz-prone and easily dried out, unruly but sometimes just flat.  And it smells great!</li>
    <li> Love the product and the seller got it to me quickly!</li>
    <li> Excellent mouse! Smells amazing and just a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Love this product . Nothing like it out there</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this every day, just or curling or volume. A little goes a long way... I have very fine hair &amp; this product gives volume &amp; leaves hair soft yet with control</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair (tight curls) and have been on a 30+ year journey to figure out how to keep my curls in control, particularly if there is even a hint of humidity.  This product is truly what works best for me, in combination with the Deva Curl shampoo/conditioner.  Just a little bit goes a long way to make soft, defined, non-frizzy curls.  I&#x27;ve never had more people compliment my hair than since I&#x27;ve figured this system out. If only I had this when I was younger!</li>
    <li> Not that great, esp. for the price.  Makes hair sticky.  I am sad to say I feel like wasted my money.  Way over priced for the product.</li>
    <li> This is the best mousse/whip I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells great, leaves my hair touchably soft while providing good hold, and I only need a little bit to style my hair. I&#x27;ll never use another mousse/whip again.</li>
    <li> This has been one of the best hair products I have used. I do have curly/wavy hair. It keeps it soft without any crunchy residue. Small amount goes a long way. A+++++++ Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> Great for fine straight hair. I&#x27;ve search for the right product for my hair for years. This is it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  Nice smell and works like a wonder. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Grabbed this as suggested by my hairdresser and I absolutely love it. I have naturally wavy hair and can never do anything with it that doesn&#x27;t end in me looking like a frazzled hobo. This stuff helps shape my curls and does NOT leave my hair feeling hard and plasticy like many other brands of mousse do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I squeeze in about a coin-dollar sized amount, work it into my palms and spread it evenly throughout my hair. Afterwards, I simply twist tendrils of hair to achieve loose curls (like I get from a curling iron), scrunch my hair from the bottom up, and let it air dry. I have tried to use a diffuser and blow dry my hair, but I end up with a frantic look still, so I simply walk out the door and let my hair naturally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey on amazon when you take into account the S&amp;H most people charge. I grabbed this bottle at a local beauty supply store; you might want to call and ask if they have any in your area before you grab one from here.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  It smells delightful, eliminates a lot of frizz and has made my hair a lot thicker.  I gave four stars because I feel it&#x27;s a little expensive.</li>
    <li> This is my second time that I buy this product and I will buy it again as soon as can is empty.  Extremelly happy and this is an item that is Salon quality</li>
    <li> Product is great and does as it claims. I smella wonderful, and is more tan a moose, nice creamy moisyurizing and thick. You don&#x27;t need alot, other reviews are correct. One good poof does the job for below shoulder hair.</li>
    <li> Gives you great body using and only have to use a small amount and it is excellent for fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> Works great and it smells even better. I would use this product even if it did not do anything for my hair just because it smells so great. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product my hair dresser used it and now I found it on Amazon and I am thrilled with how it makes my hair shiny and healthy looking</li>
    <li> Product was as described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure if I was a pro I could make this stuff work miracles with my hair, I find it leaves a good bit of residue, but to smooth down or scrunch, I think it works.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> Or at least not good for MY curly hair.  Does nothing to control frizz and does nothing for my curls.  I bought three products from this line and hate them all.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s a great product to add fullness.  It does not leave hair feeling heavy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over two years now.  The only mousse that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel scummy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give me volume, but takes care of the frizz and smells AMAZING! Not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again though, as it is rather expensive, and I have other PM products that also work well on frizz.  On the plus side, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells. It also holds firmly, but doesn&#x27;t lock my hair into place. It looks natural. Did I mention I love the way it smells?</li>
    <li> Great mousse for thin, fine hair.  Only needs a tiny bit so it lasts a long time.  Highly recommend this for adding fullness and style to your hair.</li>
    <li> Best smelling hair product ever. Does it&#x27;s job and my hair feels great. I blow dry everyday without worrying about it drying out.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff... great for curly hair and keeps my curls soft and bouncy. I have long hair and use about a golf ball size amount. Use the Awapuhi hydrocream and a defuser attachment with your hair blow dryer and you will have the most amazing bouncy curls!</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Love this product! i purchased it after I complimented someone on her hair! she had nice healthy curls and said this is what she uses.  It smells so good, too!!!! buy this.</li>
    <li> I bought this mousse because my hair stylist used it on my hair last time I had a haircut. It smells awesome and gives my fine hair a little extra oomph. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that my hair feels greasy the next morning, which without product, it doesn&#x27;t get greasy.</li>
    <li> Had it used on my hair once for a blowout at the salon. It cost $25 at the salon so pretty good discount here. I always have a great hair day when using it. Plus... it SMELLS AMAZING.</li>
    <li> I used this product both when blowdrying my hair straight and when leaving my hair curly and it works great! You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this mousse as it is very thick. It smells really good!!! When I blowdried my hair straight it gave me more volume! I would definitely  recommend this product!</li>
