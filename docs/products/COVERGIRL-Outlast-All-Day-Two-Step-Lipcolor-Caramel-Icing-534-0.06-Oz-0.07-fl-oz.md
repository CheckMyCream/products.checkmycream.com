    <li> Great price, product just as described, shipped fast and packages well.</li>
    <li> Love this long lasting lip color!  Couldn&#x27;t find the shade I wanted but Amazon had it to me in a couple days.</li>
    <li> Product is great but I had ordered 8 and received only 7.  Upon my complaint, my credit card was reimbursed for one but I would have prefered the eighth  item.</li>
    <li> Drys out my lips but the color stays well</li>
    <li> Love the Outlast Lip!  Hated that they discontinued my color #534!  I have many colors!</li>
    <li> Product does last all day long. However, the color was way lighter than expected.</li>

    <li> I love these lip colors by Covergirl. I have worn them for years.  The trick is to really rub your lips clean with a clean cloth before applying.  Color stays on literally all day.  Gloss makes it stay soft (although most times I don&#x27;t wear the gloss).  However, this color I wear almost everyday.  It is the most beautiful &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; color that goes with everything.</li>
