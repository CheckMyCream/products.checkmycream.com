      <li>I love the smell and it keeps baby&#x27;s hair nice and soft.</li>

      <li>My son has beautiful curly hair but it would get knotted up especially in the back.  </li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair looked like it was full of static the next day.</li>
      <li>With this one, it doesn&#x27;t do much, so I have to use a comb...which my toddler does not like!</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic, truly, even for an adult.</li>

      <li>I bought It for my two year old</li>
      <li>We needed a conditioner for our 9 month old&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>I consider it fresh and a little bit &amp;#34;piney.&amp;#34; If you don&#x27;t like natural scents you may not like it.</li>
      <li>makes my sons thick corse hair super soft.</li>

<li> so I tried this a few days and voila</li>
<li> Where she laid on it in her crib it tended to get fuzzy and crazy, plus the static has been crazy in the winter months!</li>
<li> At least not for our hair.</li>
<li> I recommend letting this conditioner sit in your hair for at least 5 minutes before rinsing.</li>
<li> The down side is that it is so expensive, so I&#x27;ve still been looking for a cheaper non toxic conditioner that works just as well.</li>
<li> Ill continue to use this on my baby</li>
<li> My daughter has had the worst luck with her hair on the back of her head.  </li>
<li> but Ill also use this on my hair now and then.</li>
<li> Finding hair care solutions that went along with this lifestyle was almost impossible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this stuff.  I had a friend tell me that California Baby was not tear free as stated.  Well, I took a chance anyway.  No tears here.  totally tamed my toddlers curls.</li>
    <li> Smells like Rosemary dipping oil (the kind you might dip your bread in) and doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of conditioning. My daughter&#x27;s hair looked like it was full of static the next day.</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair. Leaves it super soft and shiny. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Finally found a conditioner that works for my little girl&#x27;s hair and won&#x27;t irritate her eyes.  Love all the scents and I use the conditioner myself occasionally because it smells so good.  One tip: it seems to separate a little, so I have found that giving it a shake before using it keeps the consistency even.</li>
    <li> Really good conditioner,leave in or wash out, Great smell, gets the tangles out! I bought It for my two year old but I sometimes use it myself!</li>
    <li> Lovely gentle scent.  This is a lightweight conditioner that I bought for baby but have also used on my hair.  I had felt like my hair had a buildup of my normal Redken conditioner so I tried this a few days and voila it gave my hair back the volume I wanted.  Ill continue to use this on my baby but Ill also use this on my hair now and then.</li>
    <li> My daughter has had the worst luck with her hair on the back of her head.  I put her to sleep on her back and in the middle of the night she rubs her head against the sheet in the crib causing knotting and fluffing of her no so much there hair.  I had difficulty finding a true conditioner for her that wasn&#x27;t outrageously expensive that was still all natural and this is the perfect one!  It has a soothing smell which is great for right before bed, or nap, or just a not so good day.  I will buy this again when I come close to running out and recommend it to all my mommy and daddy friends.</li>
    <li> very good product. makes my sons thick corse hair super soft. smell is ok, its a citrus type smell I prefer coconut or shea or anything along them lines. and easy on the eyes, no tears</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great for my daughter and I like knowing the ingredients are safe.</li>
    <li> The Overtired &amp; Cranky Hair Conditioner by California Baby is great! I love the smell and it keeps baby&#x27;s hair nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell since I buy California Baby because my daughter has eczema.. but it doesn&#x27;t irritate. I like the fragrance free better</li>
    <li> my toddler son has curly hair like me and I don&#x27;t want to put product in his hair, I use the conditioner as a styling product works great !</li>
    <li> Love this for my curly headed toddler.  It helps smooth her curls and reduce frizz, and I can easily comb her wet hair.  I use this in conduction with their Jelly Mousse.</li>
    <li> I like the conditioner better than the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Smells terrific.  I actually just rub a little on my baby&#x27;s head before bed time as part of his getting ready ritual and leave it in.  He seems to enjoy the soothing head rub and it does good things for his hair and he sleeps well too.  As a side bonus I love sniffing his head/hair as he smells great :)</li>
    <li> No snarls.  Keeps the static down in my granddaughter&#x27;s hair which is why I purchased it in the first place.  Doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.  Love the fragrance too!</li>
    <li> Really High Priced for the &amp;#34;tiny&amp;#34; bottle you get.  It seems to work ok on the baby&#x27;s hair and I haven&#x27;t noticed any allergic reaction on his scalp in the week we&#x27;ve been using it.  If there&#x27;s a reaction, I&#x27;ll add it to the review.  Probably won&#x27;t buy it again, due to price.</li>
    <li> This conditioner does not get tangles out very well. My daughter has curly wavy hair, and when i use burts bees conditioner i can just run my fingers through her hair and the tangles come out. With this one, it doesn&#x27;t do much, so I have to use a comb...which my toddler does not like! I would not recommend if your kids have curly or wavy hair. Try Burt&#x27;s Bees instead.</li>
    <li> My son has beautiful curly hair but it would get knotted up especially in the back.  After I started using this hair conditioner, he has beautiful, soft curls and it leaves his hair smelling like rosemary and chamomille.  So relaxing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very waxy feeling and doesn&#x27;t really condition well. At least not for our hair. I don&#x27;t recommend it if you have curly hair.</li>
    <li> We needed a conditioner for our 9 month old&#x27;s hair. Where she laid on it in her crib it tended to get fuzzy and crazy, plus the static has been crazy in the winter months! I prefer to use as few chemicals as possible, and this all natural formula was great! I&#x27;ve even borrowed in on a few occasions as a leave-in conditioner in my own hair, and it dries soft, smooth, manageable, and not at ALL heavy or sticky! The smell is pretty good. I consider it fresh and a little bit &amp;#34;piney.&amp;#34; If you don&#x27;t like natural scents you may not like it. WE love the way it makes our baby&#x27;s hair smell and feel though! Definitely tames those frizzes and makes her hair shiny and smooth. I was afraid it&#x27;d be too heavy, as our daughter&#x27;s hair is very fine and she doesn&#x27;t have very much of it at all, but it really does dry weightless.</li>
    <li> Smells good, works OK.  Still have to use some no tangles spray after the bath, but my daughter (and son) like putting it on their hair themselves.</li>
    <li> We love the way this conditioner smells!  We use it as a leave-in conditioner since our kid&#x27;s hair is so curly and difficult to keep knot free.  Does not leave hair greasy when used as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. For anyone that is looking for an alternative to conditioners that do nothing more than coat your hair in chemicals, this is the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently cut back my chemical intake through cosmetics. Finding hair care solutions that went along with this lifestyle was almost impossible. This conditioner changed that. It smells fantastic, truly, even for an adult. I recommend letting this conditioner sit in your hair for at least 5 minutes before rinsing. It&#x27;ll leave your hair smelling great all day and give you great moisture without any weigh down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner was a little too heavy to be used as a leave in for my hair type. If you have curly, frizzy, or unmanageable hair this would be a great leave in product!</li>
    <li> I love the way my lo hair looks when I leave the conditioner in!!! It thickens her curls really nicely and smells yummy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful! Smells great. Makes hair super shiny and soft. My baby has curly unmanageable  hair. It&#x27;s made our lives so much easier.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for years for our daughter and it is amazing.</li>
    <li> smells great and works well to help get rid of tangles in their hair.</li>
    <li> I am 29 years old, I have no kids, I bought this conditioner for myself :)  I have been trying to make my own homemade products, but conditioner was tricky (the apple cider vinegar rinse is just not for me).  So, I purchased California Baby Overtired and Cranky conditioner.  I love the smell, it makes my hair soft and easy to comb through.  I love that it is all natural and does not have damaging, dangerous chemicals in it.  The down side is that it is so expensive, so I&#x27;ve still been looking for a cheaper non toxic conditioner that works just as well.</li>
