      <li>He leaves it on his beard for five minutes and it provides a nice salt and pepper look.</li>

      <li>Easy application..</li>
      <li>it works well easy to use  </li>

      <li>, it&#x27;s easy, it&#x27;s cheap, and you can&#x27;t screw it up.  </li>
      <li>(timing is important)  </li>
      <li>Getting on line is convenient and is always available.  </li>
      <li>Light / medium brown.</li>
      <li>It will take a few weeks to perfect your technique.  </li>
      <li>For me, it works well, the brush allows me to get good coverage and the look is totally natural.</li>
      <li>Works ok if you time it right.</li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t a lot of products to choose from in this niche, but luckily, Just for Men works fine.</li>
      <li>I use this instead of the full hair rinse.</li>
      <li>it does it gives you a live demonstration of hell and more hell.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this a try as it was easy and fast...</li>
      <li>I was so d@ m n happy with it except for the little gray hairs poking out here and there.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing as you can use what you need and put the caps back on to save the rest for another time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I cut the time in have and got more natural looking results</li>
      <li>He always has to buy fresh.  </li>
      <li>I reapply about one a week right after I trim.</li>
      <li>Right?  </li>
      <li>i have a very grey goat and this stuff makes it look much better!</li>
      <li>I have started to get some grey in my sideburns that this deals with nicely.</li>
      <li>This stuff is easy to apply and not messy.</li>
      <li>I can say is don&#x27;t use this product even if at first you don&#x27;t have any reaction.  </li>
      <li>Tried the first application, followed the directions to the letter (waited exactly five minutes before rinsing the product out), and NOTHING had changed.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad someone else mentioned this product as possible for coloring faded eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Works great for me, this is one of the few products I have used that has far exceeded my expectations,.  </li>
      <li>good product, i do wish it would last longer, but i only have a goatee that is cut</li>
      <li>It works pretty much as advertised</li>
      <li>Getting the appropriate shade is a hit and miss issue of determining how long to apply and then keeping track of the time there after for application as despite the advertised color it will keep getting darker the longer</li>
      <li>I usually leave it in for a good 7 minutes before hopping in the shower and shampooing it out.  </li>
      <li>Very natural color, easy to use.. looks completely natural..</li>
      <li>It is important to carefully watch the time because it gets darker fairly quickly the longer</li>
      <li>Make sure you apply this product first to the grayest areas and then go on to other areas; shave before you use this product; remove product from skin (if you go beyond your beard/sideburns) asap after application with a moist paper towel; don&#x27;t let your beard touch anything before you shampoo thoroughly; wash your hands immediately after application; shampoo with a color-sensitive shampoo.</li>
      <li>This product helps me trim 10 years off my real age.</li>
      <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t dye the grays as much as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>I have light to medium brown hair, and a lot of white in my beard.</li>
      <li>But my wife really likes the looks</li>
      <li>This product works very well.  </li>
      <li>It really works .. and very easy , my 10 year old daughter said &amp;#34; hey daddy looks younger with his new haircut............</li>
      <li>Applicator brush could be better and the color is sometimes darker than other times.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad they still make the M-30 color because the other lighter and darker shades just don&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
      <li>It is useful as you can use only as much as you need each time.</li>
      <li>I goes on quick and works in a very short amount of time.</li>
      <li>But, the color fades rather quickly (in about 3 days) and gives the hair a red tone for about 4 days.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for all of the ladies out there.  </li>
      <li>I use this to clean up the grey around my temples.</li>
      <li>Recently he discovered that if he wraps a piece of plastic wrap over the end of the tube of leftover color, then inserts the tube into a tightly sealed plastic bag, and that into one more plastic bag, it will stay fresh until he has used up all of the product.  </li>
      <li>If you are working at your computer, it&#x27;s very easy to forget the time and a light brown is suddenly dark black!</li>
      <li>Good, but not great.  </li>
      <li>Amazon rep said, keep the 1 box, and I&#x27;ll send you a new 3 pak.</li>
      <li>Covers the gray in exactly 5 minutes and leaves the red.  </li>
      <li>Brush in with the included brush, starting with the whitest areas first</li>

<ol>
    <li> Works as stated...just leave it in longer...</li>
    <li> Very natural color, easy to use.. looks completely natural.. even my haircutter said she didn&#x27;t realize I used this. Great... will re-order</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the Just For Men brand of hair color. I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 15 years.  I&#x27;ve used other brands and nothing is as good or convienent as JFM.  It will take a few weeks to perfect your technique.  Just remember start out with fewer minutes and add on each time until you achieve the color you want. Also remember to brush or come in the color after application.  This will distribute the color evenly.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this on his goatee about once every 4 or 5 days.  He leaves it on his beard for five minutes and it provides a nice salt and pepper look. I had to purchase it on Amazon because I could not find Light-Medium Brown in any store.  It is way cheaper here -I paid about $8 a box from the drugstore for a box of the same product in Medium Brown.  Have it on Subscribe and Save now and it is about $6 a box.</li>
    <li> Long time user and generally like it. Leave it on too long and you could be in for a surprise, way too dark.</li>
    <li> Women are not the only ones in charge of vanity. Men lie about their age also. This product helps me trim 10 years off my real age. Use it once a week along with a monthly Touch of Grey for my hair. Excuse me now, I have a date with a younger woman.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping good. Buy</li>
    <li> Blah blah blah, grown ass man. Read the instructions.  No irritation, no charcoal black if you follow the instructions.  All the silly complaints and one guy&#x27;s has to post for him?  If you&#x27;re using this product, you&#x27;re probably over 40.  Right?  Hint hint, nudge nudge.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT VERY DANGEROUS!  SKIN ALLERGY AND IRRITATION !&lt;br /&gt;VERY BAD! HALSA IS BETTER!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad someone else mentioned this product as possible for coloring faded eyebrows. It works wonderfully and in not time at all. I also am using it for touch-ups to my hair color. Excellent DIY product for the gals as well.</li>
    <li> I have started to get some grey in my sideburns that this deals with nicely.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product and has used it for years.  He only needs to use a portion of the product at a time, though, and used to find that the left-over product became discolored and unusable.  He always has to buy fresh.  Recently he discovered that if he wraps a piece of plastic wrap over the end of the tube of leftover color, then inserts the tube into a tightly sealed plastic bag, and that into one more plastic bag, it will stay fresh until he has used up all of the product.  Seems like a lot to do, but if it works, it saves money.  He wanted me to share this tip with fellow users.</li>
    <li> The product is very good, I&#x27;ve been using it for a while. This is the 1st time I ordered it from AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;I originally was ordering 1 box, but a message appeared stating if my order was about $4.00 more I would have free shipping and handling. To my surprise and disapointment I was charged S &amp; H.</li>
    <li> Light / medium brown. worked great. Wife loves it and the look is completely natural. I reapply about one a week right after I trim.</li>
    <li> its hair dye it works well easy to use  would bye again do not have 2o words to say so can only write write</li>
    <li> I have used for 8 years and no complaints at all; I&#x27;m 60 years old and I will use it for years to come, thank you &amp;#34;Just for men&amp;#34;.....</li>
    <li> Perfect for touch ups</li>
    <li> I was born (76 years ago) with brown hair...to this day I still have BROWN hair ( although missing a little). BUT....beard, mustache and sideburns are SALT &amp; PEPPER...so? What do I do? Shaved my head...NOT! Dye my bread, &#x27;stache and &#x27;burns...YEAH!</li>
    <li> good product, i do wish it would last longer, but i only have a goatee that is cut kind of short.i get atleast  4 or 5 uses per pack( i use 1 time a week sometimes 2 weeks). i do everything i can to keep it of my skin.( if i ever get it on my skin i use toilet paper to wipe it off immediately) never had to much skin irritation as others have said. just be slow and precise with the application. i look at the clock once i start and only allow 5 min. from that time. i have a very grey goat and this stuff makes it look much better! never had anyone notice that i died it. i started with less time and worked my way up! was half and half ( grey to brown) to start now im mostly brown.</li>
    <li> Applicator brush could be better and the color is sometimes darker than other times.  But my wife really likes the looks so if she&#x27;s happy I am happy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous that I get a horrible painful and itchy rash and blisters the second time I use it.  I followed the directions precisely and didn&#x27;t get a reaction to their 48-hour test (which I felt silly doing, but see why they suggest it now).  I&#x27;m not allergic or sensitive to anything else that I know of.  I shudder to think of the chemicals that must be in this stuff.  I&#x27;ll be mailing in for a refund, but I&#x27;d rather just have my face the way it was before.  Manufacturer claims that &amp;#34;body chemistry can change&amp;#34;.  Yeah... it&#x27;s *MY* fault?!</li>
    <li> Product works great, doesn&#x27;t pigment the skin and is very true to its color. I&#x27;d recommend this to any guy who might be Leary of using a die. I&#x27;m 58 y/o and have used it for the past 15 yrs. I honestly recommend it to anyone grainy .</li>
    <li> Just what I need for my husband!!!</li>
    <li> Works great on beards and also as a hair coloring.  I goes on quick and works in a very short amount of time.</li>
    <li> Great product though I think too expensive....used it for the past 10 years with no problems</li>
    <li> Works ok if you time it right. If you get distracted, you&#x27;ll end up with a black beard. Also, it doesn&#x27;t dye the grays as much as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I have light to medium brown hair, and a lot of white in my beard. I was hoping this stuff could help take out the white. Tried the first application, followed the directions to the letter (waited exactly five minutes before rinsing the product out), and NOTHING had changed. The goop did NOTHING to change the color of the white hair in the beard. So I tried a second time, and this time waited an extra minute before rinsing. This time, I was left with a black beard--with white tips. It looked ridiculous--as if someone had drawn on my beard with a Sharpie. Finally shaved off the beard in frustration. I&#x27;m going to call the number on the box tomorrow and see if I can get my money back. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this stuff. Just age gracefully.</li>
    <li> Covers the gray in exactly 5 minutes and leaves the red.  Watch the clock or you&#x27;ll look like Frank Zappa.  Trust me!</li>
    <li> I have always bought the Light-Medium Brown M30. It dyed quite a bit darker than brown. I ordered the Light-Brown M25 in January. I just started using the 3rd box. I am not sure if the formula is changed or if the color is too light: but it does not change the color of my beard at all. I have even left on for a lot longer than 5 minutes. The gray is still there. I am ordering the other darker color to see if that works.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  I follow the instructions and it works well.  I touch up frequently as necessary, using only a little bit at a time.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week to turn my silver/gray mustache/goatee back to my natural brown hair color.  It works great and is very easy to use.  If you want it darker, just leave it in longer.  I usually leave it in for a good 7 minutes before hopping in the shower and shampooing it out.  I get 3 or 4 uses per box, so stock on  Amazon and pay a lot less than buying this at your local store.  I could never find the &amp;#34;medium brown&amp;#34; in stores, they only carry the light and dark, so get it here!</li>
    <li> It really works .. and very easy , my 10 year old daughter said &amp;#34; hey daddy looks younger with his new haircut............lol</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years to hide the gray.  Does a good job.  It is important to carefully watch the time because it gets darker fairly quickly the longer it is left on</li>
    <li> A product I used several years. It has worked well every time I use 5-8 min. If you are working at your computer, it&#x27;s very easy to forget the time and a light brown is suddenly dark black!</li>
    <li> This stuff is easy to apply and not messy. There is no strong smell like what anything my wife uses. Getting the appropriate shade is a hit and miss issue of determining how long to apply and then keeping track of the time there after for application as despite the advertised color it will keep getting darker the longer you leave it on. That the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; comes with everything you need (tray, brush, gloves) and that the tubes can be stored indefinitely without refrigeration is a major plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a youngster anymore, so, left to itself, my goatee would come out mostly grey. I want it not to stand out, so I do color it. This system works just fine, it is, however, just a tad messy when you set up to use it. You must mix the color and the base creams together before you apply them. Nothing terrible, just a chore. Couldn&#x27;t they sell it pre-mixed in a single tube? They recommend that you re-apply every ten days. I let it go 2 weeks simply so it will always be applied on the weekend. There is a little bit of grey that starts to show if you follow this schedule, but just a touch - and it disappears a few days later.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Just for Men for about three weeks now.  It works pretty much as advertised but I&#x27;ve noticed a few issues: 1. For some reason it&#x27;ll bounce off some of your gray whiskers - leaving them totally unfazed - while dyeing others right next to them.&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t last long.  Just for Men seems to wash out whenever you shower and you&#x27;ll need to re-apply it every 3-5 days if you want to keep the gray in check.  I&#x27;d have thought it&#x27;d last longer.  At this rate I&#x27;ll have to take out a second mortgage.  Rather than that I&#x27;m going to look for something that lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I tried this lighter color to see how it would vary from teh medium brown I usually buy.  It works fine, just a little lighter.  The mustache/beard line of Just for Men doesn&#x27;t cover all my gray, it usually leaves a bit, especially on the jaw line, which is fine. I&#x27;m not trying to fool people into thinking I&#x27;m 29, but if you&#x27;ve never tried dying your hair and/or beard, give it a shot, it&#x27;s easy, it&#x27;s cheap, and you can&#x27;t screw it up.  One box usually lasts me through 3 dye jobs (mustache and goatee).  There aren&#x27;t a lot of products to choose from in this niche, but luckily, Just for Men works fine.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t leave it in to long  it&#x27;s really dark.  I left it in as per directions. It look like I used a black sharpie to darken up the mustache  I cut the time in have and got more natural looking results</li>
    <li> had to get a few gray&#x27;s out and this did the trick, however my beard got darker than i wanted as it took a little longer to get the gray out.  not messy at all.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean up the grey around my temples. It work ok, but could stay colored longer than it does. It is useful as you can use only as much as you need each time.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much one can say about this product.  I does what it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two cautions:  First, do not leave the product in longer than you are supposed to (six minutes) or it will definitely turn your whiskers too dark.  Also, check and clean any other surface it may have touched or it may prove difficult to impossible to remove (I have ruined a wash cloth this way).</li>
    <li> I use this instead of the full hair rinse. Brush it on the parts of you hair - or all of your hair - let is set for 5-7 minutes and then rinse in the shower - shampoo well so it does not get on your pillow at night. The when I use this, I get 3-4 uses out of it, versus the one time use for the hair rinse which comes in a big bottle and even if you only use some of it, you can&#x27;t store the rest</li>
    <li> I know I&#x27;ve seen some reviews that it either burned or didn&#x27;t take.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it all depends on the hair. For me, it works well, the brush allows me to get good coverage and the look is totally natural. Even good friends aren&#x27;t exactly sure what I did, but they notice a difference. The usual response is if I got a hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what I want. Coverage that looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep getting this until either my hair no longer takes it, or there&#x27;s just too much grey.</li>
    <li> This was okay but it took three or four applications before my gray went away.  I would purchase again but not very excited about it.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  Getting on line is convenient and is always available.  Which is not true in stores. Not this color.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like with this medium-brown color?  I&#x27;m glad they still make the M-30 color because the other lighter and darker shades just don&#x27;t cut it.  You *must* be careful regarding how long you leave this product on and avoid putting too much on (don&#x27;t saturate your beard).  Application hint:  Make sure you apply this product first to the grayest areas and then go on to other areas; shave before you use this product; remove product from skin (if you go beyond your beard/sideburns) asap after application with a moist paper towel; don&#x27;t let your beard touch anything before you shampoo thoroughly; wash your hands immediately after application; shampoo with a color-sensitive shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using the light-brown beard Just for Men and it has worked very well with little or no redness from using the product.  By mistake, I purchased this one (light-medium brown) and I had major redness in the application area.  I would NEVER use this light-medium brown product again.  I don&#x27;t know what they have in this that they don&#x27;t have in the light-brown, but it certainly caused bad allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> I still have a Mustache, it needs color. There I said it. I like the 3 pak. I find the stuff works terrific. Easy to apply, keep a timer handy! The 5 stars also reflect the Customer Service Dept at Amazon! The first order arrived with 2 out of 3 boxes missing. OK I haave Amazon call me, Geeze I love that feature, and explained what happened, could you sent me 2 boxes. Amazon rep said, keep the 1 box, and I&#x27;ll send you a new 3 pak. And she did, it arrived. So a great Mustache Color, and GREAT Amazon service! Jeff B, you rock!</li>
    <li> great product will buy again</li>
    <li> I use this stuff twice a month.  One package lasts about 4 applications on a close cropped, iron man styled beard.  I swear by it.</li>
    <li> Not very impressed. Actually the grey hairs are hardly touched or fade away in 3 days. The non grey hairs (that don&#x27;t need to be dyed) are looking darker! I am following the instructions but the grey hairs are hardly affected!</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not ready for a grey beard yet.  JFM does the job for me with using it every other week.  Keep an eye on the time when you put it on or you&#x27;ll end up looking like Mandrake the Magician.</li>
    <li> What can I say? You can look years younger in 5 minutes. Beard and mustache are one of the early greying areas. This product, when used as directed, will color the grey without looking artificial. If you have beard and mustache, I find it best to start application to beard, then mustache. Don&#x27;t take to long to apply. Keep an eye on the time because if you leave it on too long, it will look unnatural. Weekly application is usually needed. Great product.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try as it was easy and fast... their applicator is perfect for beards -- by far, this is their best feature. But, the color fades rather quickly (in about 3 days) and gives the hair a red tone for about 4 days. Everyone thought I was a ginger -- you can imagine my horror. I would recommend buying color and developer either here or at your local beauty supply to use professional products that don&#x27;t have this issue.</li>
    <li> A good substitute for the hair color type.. Easy application.. No hassles and I even had a whistle from some younger ladies (hope they weren&#x27;t just being nice). Oh well, I&#x27;ll keep satisfying them and bolster my ego. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a girl &amp; have dark brown hair and use the light-medium brown M-30 to touch up my roots (usually just around the face &amp; my part).  It darkens to dark brown after 30 minutes &amp; has full gray coverage.  I can get at least 2 uses per box .  This product is amazing as you can use what you need and put the caps back on to save the rest for another time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this product and being able to do a touch up once a week, people don&#x27;t even realize that I color my hair as there are never any roots showing.  I highly recommend this for all of the ladies out there.  \\&quot;Just for Men\\&quot; is NOT just for men ANYMORE!  ;)</li>
    <li> I used this product with no problems for approx 4 months.  Then all of a sudden serious red rash, blisters and ITCHING like crazy.....&lt;br /&gt;the itching was so bad I couldn&#x27;t sleep for 3 nights.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is don&#x27;t use this product even if at first you don&#x27;t have any reaction.  Believe me you soon will!!!  Just Awful</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but the instructions are adamant that you perform an allergy test 48 hours before every single time you use this product.  This requires you to put a coin-size test on the inside of your elbow and leave it there for two days.  It looks like an odd birthmark or like you somehow got poo on the inside of your arm.  Honestly, I&#x27;d rather have people *think* &amp;#34;he&#x27;s getting a little gray in his beard&amp;#34; than *say* &amp;#34;dude, what&#x27;s on your arm&amp;#34; then have to explain it to your friends and coworkers for two days.  This was a dumb idea.  I&#x27;m just going to have gray in my beard.</li>
    <li> Works great for me, this is one of the few products I have used that has far exceeded my expectations,.  Beard turned 80% white around 37 years old, made me look too old.  This color blends well with the few non-white hairs I have left. I hesitated to purchase Just for Men after reading reviews about allergic reactions. I have not had any allergic reactions and I will continue to use this until my age matches my previously white beard.  I get about 4-5 uses per box and retouch once a week. So this will cost me about  7 bucks a month, give or take depending on price and beard length.  For me that is 7 dollars well spent.  Here are my steps.  Start the shower, so it is set to go when I am done (timing is important)  Cover the bathroom sink in a dark towel.  Squirt about 1 - 1.5 inches from each tube.  I set the timer to 4 minutes, start timer, mix for 30 seconds.  Brush in with the included brush, starting with the whitest areas first, these need the most time with the color. Timer goes off, jump into the shower and shampoo the beard.  If I had to start the shower after the timer goes off and waited for it to warm up, that would add time and this will darken quickly as time goes on.  I do not go the recommended 5 minutes, but that is a personal preference.  So happy I decided to give this a try.</li>
    <li> I have taken Just for Men for years and never had any problems. Since the beginning of 2015, the product causes an allergic reaction to my skin with heavy itching and blisters. They must have changed the formula. Do not buy this product!</li>
    <li> I liked it, but the wife didn&#x27;t. And truthfully, unless you&#x27;re willing to get the whole head dyed, this looks a little wonky. Of course, I could shave my head, I suppose..</li>
    <li> The owners of this company should be publicly forced to apply this product on themselves.  All it does it gives you a live demonstration of hell and more hell.&lt;br /&gt;Use it if you want to end up in ER with serious skin allergies.&lt;br /&gt;My advice….  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can believe how many fake positive reviews are out here , planted by the company who manufacture this nasty  product.&lt;br /&gt;Shave off your beards if grey is the disappointment.  But for your own safety,  stay the hell away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGHLY WARNED!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Always the best for coloring.</li>
    <li> The usual stuff.  It works, but it can cause skin irritation.</li>
    <li> works good, fast easy to use.</li>
    <li> It really only takes five minutes to get rid of the gray in your beard.  My only problem is that the stuff splatters on my sink, and only shows up as a stain about an hour later. And by the team you can see the stains, they are extremely difficult to eliminate.  But my beard looks pretty good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been growing my beard out until it was nice and burly looking. I was so d@ m n happy with it except for the little gray hairs poking out here and there. Then I saw this product. I just wanted to cover up the gray and maybe lighten my beard a bit, closer to it&#x27;s natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned my precious beard BLACK !! BLACK!??  I didn&#x27;t want a black beard. I wanted my natural color or something close to it. Needless to say, after all the growth, grooming, trimming, clipping, shaping, watering, love, and attention, I had to shave. Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Hubs has used this for years.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> Good, but not great.  Would be better if it stayed longer - color fades after multiple washings.  Will continue to use.</li>
