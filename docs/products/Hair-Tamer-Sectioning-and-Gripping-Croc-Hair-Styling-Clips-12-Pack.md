      <li>They are great!</li>
      <li>And the price on Amazon is the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere yet.</li>
      <li>Absolutely wonderful!!!!</li>
      <li>Perfect tools to help with the perfect blow-out.</li>
      <li>Great price and product.</li>
      <li>The hair clips work great.  </li>
      <li>However when styling my hair in sections it works great.  </li>
      <li>These are GREAT clips.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t great.  </li>
      <li>it gives good hold to your hair.</li>
      <li>I love them!  </li>
      <li>I would have stuck with them if I hadn&#x27;t read about a much better option: the Color Trak croc clips that have a rubberized finish.</li>
      <li>I love these clips,</li>
      <li>I also read about a trick where you sleep with all of your hair in a bun on top of your head, held with one of these types of clips.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, it didn&#x27;t snag AT ALL when I unclipped them and shook my hair loose.</li>
      <li>I have lots of hair, it slips and tangles easily.</li>
      <li>so I need strong clips to hold it all.</li>
      <li>I have never, ever in my life found a hair clip that actually securely holds my hair.</li>
      <li>I have found a way to make it work for me, but was expecting it to be smooth.</li>
      <li>These are fantastic.</li>
      <li>These fit the bill.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re sturdily made, easily pinched open, bright, and HIGHLY &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>They shipped super fast!</li>
      <li>They are also very gentle on the hair.</li>
      <li>I mostly wear it curly, but occasionally I like to wear it straighten it.  </li>
      <li>When my very long hair is wet and gloopy with conditioner, I can easily gather it up on top of my head and secure it with just one of these clips.</li>
      <li>These are the perfect clips for long, short, thick, or fine hair.</li>
      <li>Great product for thick hair!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still astounding to me how much hair these little guys will hold.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>thanks to their teeth.</li>
      <li>The original story was so that someone with straight hair could get curl in their hair, but I use it for just the opposite.  </li>
      <li>Since red is my favorite color, I immediately bought the red ones.  </li>
      <li>They are a bit more expensive but work much better for me when using styling products.</li>
      <li>It worked with my naturally textured hair and when my hair was flat-ironed straight.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not cute enough to go into public with, but they&#x27;re great while you&#x27;re doing your hair or doing stuff around the house.</li>
      <li>The hold my hair in the different sections very well.</li>
      <li>I have very thick hair and truly fell in love with these clips.</li>
      <li>These are GREAT for long hair, thick or thin they stay in and don&#x27;t pull or tangle.</li>

<li> love these clips and they hold my thick, heavy, curly hair</li>
<li> Straightening it is quite the ordeal and involves sectioning my hair, blow drying it with a round brush in very small sections, and then following up with a flat iron if I want it super straight.  </li>
<li> They work equally well on dry hair.</li>
<li> I have long hair</li>
<li> These held my hair in place whether I twisted up wispy bangs, 1&amp;#34; sections, or pulled back a full head of hair.</li>
<li> They are sturdy and I like that they&#x27;re large enough to hold my thick hair!</li>
<li> I especially like them because they&#x27;re so much easier to open than butterfly clips, which are almost impossible to use in</li>
<li> I have very thick, naturally curly hair.  </li>
<li> However the bottom piece that is closest to your head has little bumps that pull my hair when putting the clip in.  </li>
<li> In the past I used an odd assortment of clips.  </li>
<li> These are not very good for sectioning hair when you&#x27;re using styling products.</li>
<li> Hard to get in and out.</li>
<li> As others may have mentioned, if your fingers are slick from product, it is very difficult to open these and remove them.  </li>
<li> I have thick hair and a lot of it.  </li>
<li> Why can&#x27;t they take this technology (such as it is) and make it into a clip that can be worn in public without looking insane??</li>
<li> These hold my thick hair in place so well!</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

    <li> The hair clips work great.  However the bottom piece that is closest to your head has little bumps that pull my hair when putting the clip in.  I have found a way to make it work for me, but was expecting it to be smooth.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT clips. I have long hair so I need strong clips to hold it all. These clips can, PAIN-FREE. They&#x27;re not cute enough to go into public with, but they&#x27;re great while you&#x27;re doing your hair or doing stuff around the house.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, naturally curly hair.  I mostly wear it curly, but occasionally I like to wear it straighten it.  Straightening it is quite the ordeal and involves sectioning my hair, blow drying it with a round brush in very small sections, and then following up with a flat iron if I want it super straight.  In the past I used an odd assortment of clips.  I read about these types of clips recently and decided I had to try them.  Since red is my favorite color, I immediately bought the red ones.  I love them!  The hold my hair in the different sections very well. I also read about a trick where you sleep with all of your hair in a bun on top of your head, held with one of these types of clips.  The original story was so that someone with straight hair could get curl in their hair, but I use it for just the opposite.  If I have straightened my hair this method helps to keep it from re-curling or frizzing during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these clips and they hold my thick, heavy, curly hair well while I style it.</li>
    <li> Perfect tools to help with the perfect blow-out. They shipped super fast!</li>
    <li> These are GREAT for long hair, thick or thin they stay in and don&#x27;t pull or tangle.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic. I have lots of hair, it slips and tangles easily. These held my hair in place whether I twisted up wispy bangs, 1&amp;#34; sections, or pulled back a full head of hair.

    <li> Absolutely wonderful!!!! They are sturdy and I like that they&#x27;re large enough to hold my thick hair! I ordered another set! Great price and product. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> it gives good hold to your hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and truly fell in love with these clips. They&#x27;re sturdy, and the fact that they come in colors makes me even happier!</li>
    <li> These hold my thick hair in place so well!</li>
    <li> I have never, ever in my life found a hair clip that actually securely holds my hair. Now I have. Why can&#x27;t they take this technology (such as it is) and make it into a clip that can be worn in public without looking insane??</li>
    <li> Once you go croc, you never go back. It&#x27;s still astounding to me how much hair these little guys will hold. They&#x27;re sturdily made, easily pinched open, bright, and HIGHLY &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; thanks to their teeth. And the price on Amazon is the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere yet.</li>
    <li> These are not very good for sectioning hair when you&#x27;re using styling products.

    <li> Great product for thick hair!</li>
    <li> These are the perfect clips for long, short, thick, or fine hair. Studying cosmo. I love these clips,</li>
    <li> They are great! Thanks</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t great.  Pulls my ahir.  Hard to get in and out. Will likely throw out.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and a lot of it.  It struggles to hold up all of my hair.  However when styling my hair in sections it works great.  Just not as what I had intended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been searching for clips to use in the shower and when cleaning my face at night. These fit the bill. When my very long hair is wet and gloopy with conditioner, I can easily gather it up on top of my head and secure it with just one of these clips. They work equally well on dry hair. I especially like them because they&#x27;re so much easier to open than butterfly clips, which are almost impossible to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is the metal spring. I wonder if it will rust.</li>
