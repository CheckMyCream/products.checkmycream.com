      <li>Very happy with this hose!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best hose for the money, but I wouldn&#x27;t go expecting the best hose in the world, cause that it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>the 10&#x27; length is perfect to work with.</li>
      <li>Great price too!</li>
      <li>Worked perfectly in conjunction with PointZero Airbrush Reducer Adaptor 1/4&amp;#34; BSP  to connect my PointZero airbrush with my Badger air compressor.</li>
      <li>good hose at a great price!</li>
      <li>it was a great purchase.</li>

      <li>Very nice air hose.</li>

      <li>Good quality for the money</li>
      <li>Good hose for the price.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
      <li>It fit my Copic airbrush perfectly and works fine.</li>
      <li>Really nice hoses for the money.  </li>
      <li>Works great with a quick disconnect.</li>
      <li>no bling, just what you need and nothing more.... fully functional.</li>
      <li>and I opted to get the 10&#x27; instead of the 6&#x27; to give myself more room to work.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered more of each.  </li>
      <li>when hooked it up it blew the end off of it so which means the fitting was not securly connected on it</li>
      <li>Better quality than I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>Works with no problems, great price, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>For me I needed to add 2 more</li>
      <li>Very nice piece purchased as a back up to another pointzero airbrush 10&#x27; braided hose which use all the time very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised and price was good.</li>
      <li>am looking for a course to fine thread fitting to solve the problem.</li>
      <li>The ends are of good quality and joints seals very well.</li>
      <li>The Iwata air brush connection is fine thread</li>
      <li>Both ends of the hose are fine threaded.</li>
      <li>Problem is I can&#x27;t find an adaptor to convert it to fit my air compressor.</li>
      <li>It works great an im just starting to learn to airbrush</li>
      <li>Otherwise, 10 feet, nice color, CHEAP!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to beat the heck out of while leaving my nicer hose as backup/home hose, so for that it&#x27;s fantastic as I don&#x27;t mind it getting wrecked, (and as with all cheap things, once you iron out that which makes it cheap, it&#x27;ll probably last a lifetime or two).</li>
      <li>allows me to put noisey compressor in other room, great quality</li>
      <li>This hose was delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>This product arrived quickly as well.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with these hoses especially when fitted with quick connects.  </li>
      <li>This hose is, as far as I can tell, identical to one I already have that cost a lot more.</li>
      <li>The first time that I tried to use it, the end blew off.  </li>
      <li>In the future, I&#x27;m going to stick with Badger hoses that I used for many years and never had a problem with their hoses.</li>
      <li>I took a chance and these turned out to be identical to the higher priced units.  </li>
      <li>I have used very little but to this point it seems to be a good hose.</li>
      <li>Have not used it but initial inspection has been dry good.</li>
      <li>but the other end which connects to the filter needs to be course thread because most brass connector fittings are course thread.</li>
      <li>The brush end is better, but still it&#x27;s slightly leaky.</li>
      <li>Ok but the tablets face is smashed I will send it back and want my money back as well</li>
      <li>Not a brand name, but decent quality inexpensive air hose.</li>
      <li>I was using 30 psi a normal airbrush pressure for me.  </li>
      <li>fine thread will go on the course thread but only a couple of turns which does not allow the internal rubber bushing to seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Due to the cheap price, I ordered another one and decided to repurpose this for another use.</li>
      <li>this is a real quality air hose I&#x27;m definitely going to buy a few more</li>
      <li>I have purchased similar hoses before from a different source at a higher price per unit.</li>
      <li>I would be surprised if they didn&#x27;t c0me from the same factory in china</li>

    <li> Sorry it has not even been used cause when hooked it up it blew the end off of it so which means the fitting was not securly connected on it, it was loose the fitting that fits on to the compressor was already bad when i got it so i need another one</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best hose for the money, but I wouldn&#x27;t go expecting the best hose in the world, cause that it&#x27;s not. It doesn&#x27;t leak per se, but the connectors aren&#x27;t well made/designed, in that they don&#x27;t seal well on my compressor. The brush end is better, but still it&#x27;s slightly leaky. (Your experience may vary depending on your equipment). For me I needed to add 2 more o rings 1 at each end for a reliable seal. Otherwise, 10 feet, nice color, CHEAP!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to beat the heck out of while leaving my nicer hose as backup/home hose, so for that it&#x27;s fantastic as I don&#x27;t mind it getting wrecked, (and as with all cheap things, once you iron out that which makes it cheap, it&#x27;ll probably last a lifetime or two).</li>
    <li> It works great an im just starting to learn to airbrush</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied. This product arrived quickly as well. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly in conjunction with PointZero Airbrush Reducer Adaptor 1/4&amp;#34; BSP  to connect my PointZero airbrush with my Badger air compressor.</li>
    <li> Ok but the tablets face is smashed I will send it back and want my money back as well</li>
    <li> Really nice hoses for the money.  Better quality than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Very nice air hose. Supple. bendable. Pliable. Connection is firm and no air leaks. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and for half the price (or less) of other brand hoses.</li>
    <li> I use this on my air brush from the same company. Works great with a quick disconnect.</li>
    <li> I have used very little but to this point it seems to be a good hose. However don&#x27;t know about durability!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these hoses especially when fitted with quick connects.  I have ordered more of each.  the 10&#x27; length is perfect to work with.</li>
    <li> good hose at a great price!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the purchase.  I have purchased similar hoses before from a different source at a higher price per unit. I took a chance and these turned out to be identical to the higher priced units.  I would be surprised if they didn&#x27;t c0me from the same factory in china</li>
    <li> Does what I need it to and I opted to get the 10&#x27; instead of the 6&#x27; to give myself more room to work.  Very happy with this hose!</li>
    <li> nice and durable air hoses!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted for my compressor and airbrush.</li>
    <li> This hose is, as far as I can tell, identical to one I already have that cost a lot more. Works with no problems, great price, fast shipping. Enough said...</li>
    <li> This hose was delivered quickly. It fit my Copic airbrush perfectly and works fine. I had to use an adapter to connect it to my compressor but I expected to have to do that. All in all it was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> This item arrived on time but the threads on one end wasn&#x27;t manufactured correctly and would not screw onto any fittings. Due to the cheap price, I ordered another one and decided to repurpose this for another use. The second one worked as expected.</li>
    <li> The hose I received is junk.  The first time that I tried to use it, the end blew off.  I tried several times to put the end back onto the hose but the end kept blowing off when it was attached to the compressor.  I was using 30 psi a normal airbrush pressure for me.  In the future, I&#x27;m going to stick with Badger hoses that I used for many years and never had a problem with their hoses.</li>
    <li> Very nice piece purchased as a back up to another pointzero airbrush 10&#x27; braided hose which use all the time very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> this is a real quality air hose I&#x27;m definitely going to buy a few more so yes I do recommend him 5 stars two thumbs up ! A+ !</li>
    <li> Good hose for the price. The ends are of good quality and joints seals very well. Mates well with my Badger airbrush</li>
    <li> not shiny, no bling, just what you need and nothing more.... fully functional.</li>
    <li> Works great!! Great price too!</li>
    <li> Not a brand name, but decent quality inexpensive air hose.</li>
    <li> allows me to put noisey compressor in other room, great quality</li>
    <li> The fittings on this hose will not hook up to a regular 1/4 air adapter. The threads are bsp which means that they are different than the connection on your compressor line, so you need to buy this hose with a connected adapter on one end. They sell them. Get that one.</li>
    <li> Both ends of the hose are fine threaded. The Iwata air brush connection is fine thread but the other end which connects to the filter needs to be course thread because most brass connector fittings are course thread. The non airbrush end will not tighten enough and leaks when air is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fine thread will go on the course thread but only a couple of turns which does not allow the internal rubber bushing to seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for a course to fine thread fitting to solve the problem.</li>
    <li> Have not used it but initial inspection has been dry good.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the money</li>
    <li> like it. That he was looking for.</li>
    <li> Work well with my tc20t and hd130.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and price was good. Fits my Neo CN great. Problem is I can&#x27;t find an adaptor to convert it to fit my air compressor.</li>
