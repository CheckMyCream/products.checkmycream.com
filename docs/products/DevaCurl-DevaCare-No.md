<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the way your hair becomes more full and softer with this product. You do have to get used to no lather. Once you get past that the shampoo and conditioner in one is great. My hair looks much better than it did before. It also combs out without any knots. My hair is shoulder length and highlighted. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> My hair was falling out, breaking and full of knots.  I started research and found devacare products.  Not only is my hair beautiful, growing long and healthy but my curl pattern is better as well.  I use this on my kids (4.5 and 7) and both of their hair is growing thick and beautiful.  In addition I was diagnosed with dermatitis which is worsened by SLS&#x27;s so this change would have been necessary.</li>
    <li> Inspired by the infomercial, I tried Wen for my naturally curly, fine, dry hair.  It worked and I loved it, but about every three weeks I just had to use a shampoo that lathered to feel clean.  It seemed Wen left a nasty, gooey buildup. A curly-haired friend recommended Deva Curl No Poo with Deva One Condition and I&#x27;ve been using them for several months. I \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my hair every day and have noticed no buildup.  A liter bottle lasts about eight weeks for me (I have relatively short hair). Just a note, my hairdresser last week said she can&#x27;t believe how \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; my hair is these days.  She, too, has curly hair and is going to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE November, 2012: My multiracial adopted daughter, now almost 4-years-old, has \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair that is very difficult to care for.  I have tried every imaginable combination of products and the Deva Care/Curl (I swear they seem the same to me) No Poo is the best for her hair.  We use it every week.  It seems to cut through all the argon oil and shea butter that I use for daily styling.  It is not \\&quot;no tears\\&quot;, so when I&#x27;m cleansing her hair, I give her a wet washcloth to hold over her eyes.  I am a huge fan of the Deva line.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair. For years I blow-dried it straight, and because I also color my hair every other month, my hair ended up very dry and damaged. I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos, and my cabinet is full of half-used bottles that I was unsatisfied with.     I decided to stop blow-drying and let my hair naturally wave. What a pain. Store brand and salon brand shampoos still left my hair dry. I color my hair reddish-brown, and it always faded quickly. Whenever I&#x27;d re-color it with the same exact color, people always thought I had changed it and dyed it darker. Nope, the shampoos I was using were just fading the dark color to orange.    I gave DevaCare a try, even though its on the high end price-wise, I&#x27;ve spent so much on different brands of shampoo, it was worth a try. Thank god I did, this is the best hair cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.     My hair looks so healthy now. I use it with the DevaCare One Conditioner, and it looks great. My hair color doesn&#x27;t fade, now my roots actually come in lighter than my dyed hair, which never happened before. My hair now air-dries very well with a natural wave and is very soft.    The one thing I&#x27;ve discovered after using this for a few months, is that I still need to use a standard shampoo about once a week or so. My scalp is naturally pretty oily, and my hair gets weighed down after a week of just using this cleanser, but its a small price to pay for having healthy hair.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Great  fresh smell and makes my hair feel soft and silky.   The bottle is heavy though. I wish it came with a pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> I have struggled to find a product that does not strip or gunk up my baby fine thin hair which is full of curls. I decided to give this a try after having it talked up to me by my hair stylist. She is supposed to be a curly hair expert. The only issue I have with that is that most every naturally curly haired person I have met also has some level of a sensitive scalp. I am one of the most sensitive. I explained this to her repeatedly and she swore this stuff was good for people like me because it was more natural.   I have to say, after using it for a month now; I will not be continuing its use. I will admit, it is great for my hair. It is not weighed down and it is not stripped of all moisture (stripping shampoos are bad for dry hair). However, my scalp has gradually become more and more irritated with each passing week. My daughter wanted to try it also, as she inherited my fine curls and within two weeks her scalp was broken out all over (we&#x27;re talking flaking and redness, not just itchy). That worrisome part to this is that we both only used the product 2-3 times a week; not even every day. My scalp would likely be on fire if I had used it daily and she would be bleeding.   I also agree with another reviewer that this \\&quot;natural\\&quot; no-poo is still full of unhealthy ingredients. I wish I had listened to my gut and not purchased this junk. There are plenty of organic and true herbal shampoos (not the mainstream crap) out there which are much, much healthier for any hair; Desert Essence for example.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this shampoo about two years ago, it has been the best thing for my curly hair. I would NEVER go back to normal shampoo. I can&#x27;t believe I even ever used normal shampoo on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and all of the Deva Curl products.&lt;br /&gt;They are a must for people who have curly hair--I never knew how much I could love my curls until I started using these products.</li>
    <li> This is great if you color your hair!</li>
    <li> The only way that this product differs from traditional shampoo is that it does not lather. Other than that, it still has damaging chemicals - alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Laureth 4, Diazolidinyl Urea, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, etc. These chemicals are bad for the environment and bad for your scalp and hair. This product is nothing more than a gimmick for the easily fooled.  If you really want to go no shampoo, try the baking soda and apple cider vinegar method. This product is not worth it.</li>
    <li> Since I started using DevaCare products, the look and feel of my hair are awesome!! I get compliments about the shine and my perfectly shaped non-frizz curls, all the time. I have recommended this products to all my curly-haired friend. So if youre looking for a great product for your curly hair...DevaCurl or DevaCare is it!!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I had to try this shampoo. I have naturally curly hair that is also colored. I struggle with frizziness and have tried alot of products. This shampoo is great (once I got past the fact that there is no lather). It&#x27;s gentle on my color and my curls really do look alot better, definitely less frizz. You do need to use a generous amount of shampoo to work through your hair. Hair feels nice before you even add the conditioner. I am trying the Devacare One Conditioner. Both smell really good! I admit I do use regular shampoo every 3rd or 4th day, just because I do use alot of products on my hair. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased the small bottles from my hairdresser for $18 each. Very happy to find it here at a much better price. I really like the way it works on my curly hair. I can just wash, condition, and let it dry naturally. No more blow drying it straight as it&#x27;s not frizzy anymore!</li>
    <li> This no-poo works wonders on my hair. Normal shampoos leave my hair quite dry, but this cleanser leaves the natural oils in your hair and keeps it moisterized naturally. I would definately recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  It takes a little getting used to when you are more familiar with seeing major bubbles in shampoo BUT this no-poo shampoo does leave your hair clean and fresh without all the extra detergent so I can&#x27;t complain.  Smells good to.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after watching an infomercial for Wen products and decided to look for a similar product for a better value. It led me to DevaCare No poo cleanser, and I was very surprised by it&#x27;s performance. The no suds formula was pleasantly scented and I did not miss the lather. My hair usually gets very dry and tangled after shampooing, but not with this product! My hair was very silky and easy to comb. The shine was fantastic! I do not want to use conventional shampoo again! And it did NOT strip my color! Great product. Just a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I use all Deva products, as recommended by my hairdresser.  I am now used to the no-lather shampoo and it seems to do an excellent job of cleaning my hair without bubbles.  As I mentioned in my review of the conditioner, I find it helpful to use a single line of products, created to work together, and avoid the need to try every individual made-for-curly-hair product on the market.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed and much cheaper than buying from a salon.  From the time I ordered to the time I received the item was less than a week.</li>
    <li> My previous No-poo experience was with Wen. Needing another bottle and not wanting to the Wen price I decided to scour amazon&#x27;s offerings. So glad I chose the Deva No-poo, it is a great product, at a better price and more quantity for your buck. I don&#x27;t even have curly hair - just a bit of wave.  Shampooing with Wen (lavender bottle) was like using ultra-thick conditioner. It cleansed but the following day along my hair line around my face, my hair had a bit of an oily look to it.  Not so with Deva. I shampoo with Deva about every 2-3 days and my hair looks and feels healthy and fabulous. And the scent is DELISH! (p.s. I use Suave professionals moisture conditioner after shampooing with Deva No-poo.)</li>
    <li> The DevaCurl version of No-poo is the only cleanser that ever allowed me to finger comb my hair.  This stuff does not even come close.  I am upset with myself for ordering the wrong thing.  Now I have a 32oz bottle to go through before I can order the right thing!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo. It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing and feels almost like a conditioner.  I use it with DevaCare One Condition and Kinky Curly Curl Custard for perfect curls.</li>
    <li> Love how this stuff makes my scalp feel. I have color treated, kinky curly, african american hair. My curls are poppin after I use this stuff. I section off my hair into fours and use the product in each section. Then follow up with the conditioner</li>
    <li> I have been using this as well as the Deva Curl daily creamy conditioner for around 2 years now and I love this stuff. It leaves my naturally curly hair manageable and soft..and I have noticed a lot less frizz. I love this stuff and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I have used for my curly hair. It detangles hair very nicely and makes my hair soft and super easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Deva products for years and absolutely love them for cleansing &amp; conditioning.  I don&#x27;t have curly hair, but wavy on good days, and very long hair.  I also frequently blow it out, but this product never dries my hair out.  It takes a bit to get used to the &amp;#34;non-lather&amp;#34; cleanser, and your hair may have to get used to it, but stick with it &amp; use it on a regular basis and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> If you have eczema or psoriasis on your scalp, you know how hard it is to stop the itching, flaking, and even bleeding. I tried every shampoo --including all the \\&quot;stinky\\&quot; medicated ones--and nothing helped. I had resorted to slathering lotion on the worst spots....not the best look in hair styles. I had a hair appointment one day and knowing I was about to have my hair washed, cut and styled anyway, I decided to go to my appointment with lotion still in my hair. My stylist looked at my lotioned-up \\&quot;do\\&quot; and said, \\&quot;I can help.\\&quot; She worked what felt like MORE lotion into my hair and said it was DevaCare&#x27;s No-Poo Shampoo. It was weird because there was ZERO lather. I couldn&#x27;t imagine how a soft, slippery lotion could actually CLEAN my hair and scalp. But I couldn&#x27;t believe how soothing it felt AND how good its light citrus fragrance smelled. After she cut and styled my hair, it looked and felt incredibly clean, soft and full. She said it was extra gentle for colored (like mine) or curly (not mine) hair. I never bought a \\&quot;salon-type\\&quot; shampoo before but I went home with a bottle of No-Poo Shampoo and a bottle of the DevaCare Conditioner.  It&#x27;s pretty pricey stuff, so I was glad to find this extra-large size online---much more economical. (I just had to be careful to make sure I was ordering the DevaCARE shampoo, and not the DevaCURL product.) I&#x27;ve been using No-Poo exclusively for almost a year now and will never let anything else touch my hair. Oh yeah...and I&#x27;ve had no itching scalp since using it.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that really works for my curly hair. I use it 2-3 times a week. You really get used to not having to have suds, and it smells great and really doesn&#x27;t harm your hair at all. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything comparable for curly hair that preserves your hair&#x27;s health as well as this product.</li>
    <li> The Deva Care No-Fade Zero Lather Cleanser is much less drying to hair than many other shampoos.  It doesn&#x27;t lather, makes hair feel smooth, and when combined with Deva One Care conditioner, is a perfect combination to trapping the moisture most curlies need for their hair to look great.</li>
    <li> I liked the product, but thought it was low when it arrived from the vendor. The level line was right above the label instead of near the cap</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair. I like to use this mostly as a conditioner. My hair feels really clean after I use this. If I get any build up in my hair I put baking soda in my shampoo and use this afterwards. You could use this a both shampoo and conditioner. My hair is fairly straight. You don&#x27;t have to have curly hair for this product to work.</li>
    <li> I love the gentle cleansing that this shampoo provides.  My hair is shiny clean but maintains its natural state.  I have very fragile hair and am very picky about shampoo.  This is the one that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been great for my hair.  It ended my frizzies.  I have very curly hair and the curls look great with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.  I have thick, curly hair, use syling products every day, and wash my hair once a week. I love how clean this gets my hair without sulfates!  My hair feels silky soft and clean and the smell is wonderful.  I&#x27;ll never go back to sulfates and I&#x27;ll never buy another cleanser again!</li>
    <li> This is so worth it! I have naturally curly hair and has been using the drugstore sulfate free and it worked...so I thought.  I would try this since id been using the b leave in for 2 years as recommended by a stylist.  Ive been using this only for 4+ months..with the devacare one condition.  I then style with the b leave in and light defining gel.  I get compliments now all the time.  My curls are finally defined and moisturized.  I have fine hair, medium amount ( not thick or thin).</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product!</li>
    <li> This takes some time to get used to at first...shampoo that doesn&#x27;t suds? It&#x27;s totally against what we all grew up with! But, oh my gosh, after some time of me getting used to it, I could not go back.  Suds scare me that it&#x27;s stripping my hair now of the healthy stuff.  So, for 2 years, I have been using this and am completely satisfied how my hair went from frizzy, limp waves to gorgeous waves.  Even if I don&#x27;t put anything in my hair after the shower, it&#x27;s beautiful! I always wanted to get out of the shower and just go - and I can now.  I had to live with greasy serums in my hair, or flat iron it because I hated it, furthering the damage.  But once my hair dresser convinced me to switch, I can&#x27;t say enough! Even if you don&#x27;t have curly hair, it&#x27;s worth it.  My daughter has straight hair, but we have switched her to this and it&#x27;s gorgeous! If we use the line, I can actually get a gorgeous wave in her hair! The trick to the Deva line for you curly girls? Stay away from TOWELS! Go buy some cheap flour or cheese cloths and scrunch the hair dry with that.  Or, even microfiber towels.  Regular terry/bath towels cause the frizz! Wash, condition (leave the conditioner in) and scrunch hair dry.  Gorgeous waves or curls :)</li>
    <li> I have very fine, wavy color-treated hair that I need to protect.  This product really is amazing: it is the only one that really moisturizes the hair, and leaves it soft and supple: either to leave curly or to straighten.  Living in a dry climate, not enough moisture in the air to leave natural, so I usually straighten, and it truly helps with frizzing.  Doesn&#x27;t suds up, but if I need a good wash, just repeat.</li>
    <li> I loooooove this product! It&#x27;s litterally the only thing I&#x27;ve been using for years! I have bleached blond hair so it tends to get a little damaged from that. At the same time I have very straight, moderately thick, over oily hair. This product severally cuts down on the oily feeling. Also, I never have to use conditioner with this! It leaves my hair feeling so soft and healthy and NOT GREASY! Love it, highly recommend. I like it better than the Devacurl no poo too, that one makes my hair a little TOO soft. This one is juuuust right :D</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo, hands-down.  Not many stores around my area carry this product line.  It is great for curly hair like mine.  Gentle but effective.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Much kinder to your hair than any other hair washing product. This bottle is gigantic but it brings the price down out of the stratosphere. I transfer it to smaller bottles that are easier to wield in the shower.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It does a good job cleaning, is gentle on my hair color and has eliminated the need for anti dandruff shampoo.  It is also the first shampoo that gets the tangles out of my curly hair.  I used to have to use conditioner to get the tangles out, now my hair rinses tangle free.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, works great for curly hair that is colored too.  Scent could be better, but I can live without that.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shampoo for curly tops: ) It leaves it thicker and healthier after each cleansing and I recommend purchasing the curl spritz and using it the day after you shampoo instead of cleansing every day.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been fine, thin,oily, and wavy, but very quickly turned to dry and breaking. I thought it was my hair stylist as she had used a different brand of hair color recently, but I discovered I had thyroid problems. Dr has now got my thyroid issues fixed(I hope), but my hair is so damaged. Hair stylist told me to use paraben and sulfate free products and I found this after researching products online. If your hair is not colored or highlighted you can try the DevaCurl No Poo Cleanser. I have used both and I love them. I will continue to use this product. My hair does not feel like straw!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and it works great.  I have curly hair and I tend to get oily around my crown easily.  This cleans well and smells good.</li>
    <li> Great lather-less cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years and it&#x27;s perfect for my very curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time along with Deva One Condition. I have baby fine, very curly hair and this product does get it clean without detergent and afterward it dries perfectly without frizz.  Regular shampoos are simply too drying for my curly hair and this product is perfect.  On the rare occasion I do decide to blow it out straight, my hair still looks great.  For the first time in my life, I have healthy curly hair, no frizz and no split ends.  My stylist recommended Deva products and it was good advice.  I can&#x27;t find any downsides to it at all.</li>
    <li> This was my first deva care purchase. When I&#x27;ve gone to the DevaChan salon they have used this on my hair so I knew it was the same great product as DevaCurl no poo, just better for color treated hair and with a citrus scent. This product and brand is well worth the money. I have hair past my shoulders and I go through a 32oz bottle in about 4 months. I love my curly hair for the first time in my life and DevaCurl is a big part of that. I&#x27;ve been using the nopoo for almost a year and I still love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser. It&#x27;s keeping my hair soft and healthy. The only thing I would change is the dispenser. It&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle, so I replaced the cap with a pump dispenser from a lotion bottle. It&#x27;s much easier to use now, and it smells great.</li>
    <li> It really moisturizes my hair and scalp. I get really dry scalp with other shampoos. I think the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam makes the difference. It also smells good, like orange creamsicles.</li>
    <li> If you find a better deal on this great product let me know. Great for our curly haired family. Not sure why there is a minimum word count for these things.</li>
    <li> My hair feels clean after every use.  Stops the drying of normal shampoo.  Works great with One Condition also from Deva.</li>
    <li> i was misled to believe this was the original DevaCurl product No-Poo  which i love.  this is a terrible knock off--so thick it can barely come out of the bottle.  it feels like a bad body moisturizer and unlike the original product which has a great peppermint scent which truly invigorates the scalp--this one is cloyingly sweet and reminds me of fruit flavored bubble gum.  Yuck!  very disappointing.  i resent being manipulated by the seller into believing this was original product.</li>
    <li> I swear by no-poo.  I originally started using it for my naturally fine, curly hair, and  I continued after I started to straighten my hair with keratin treatments.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other sulfate frees since then, but I&#x27;ve found that the no-poo extends the life of the keratin the longest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it has two drawbacks: First, it basically feels like washing your hair with conditioner, because there is zero lather.  You really need to scrub at your scalp to get it fully clean, and often times I find that I don&#x27;t do a good enough job.  Second, I don&#x27;t like the smell, which is a mix between strawberry and bubblegum.  Thankfully it&#x27;s not very strong, but I much prefer the scent of the no-poo for curly hair, which is more minty.  I think I&#x27;m going to switch back to that after I finish this bottle.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this stuff!!! My hair is softer and shinier. I also have natural curls that in the past have been hard to tame and very frizzy. Now, my curls are practically effortless to maintain. I would recommend this product to anyone I know with curly, color damaged hair</li>
    <li> Will buy again, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> best curl hair product ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great no sulfate cleanser</li>
    <li> I purchased No Poo Shampoo and I was sent conditioner, so I ended up having to purchase the shampoo elsewhere</li>
    <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t make a lot of suds because it&#x27;s free of sulfates but it definitely leave hair clean and soft and it doesn&#x27;t fade my color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend! I use only their products on my hair. If you have curly hair, this is the product to get. I searched for years trying to find the right products for my curls. When I found these I never went back. I&#x27;ve been using them loyaly for over 8 years now, love, love love!</li>
    <li> If you love Deva Curl, don&#x27;t be mislead by whatever this is. Is seems thick old and smelly, nothing like Deva Curl. Looked funny as soon as it arrived. Compared to Deva Curl that I still had and realized this is either old version or an imposter. Not wasting time to figure out, will return tomorrow. BEWARE...  OK...Not imposter...Had to find out- This is item suggested for color treated hair.  I prefer Deva Curl, lighter consistancy and different fragrance. Would be helpful if differentiation was in descriptions! Choose carefully between Deva Curl &amp; Deva Care.</li>
    <li> I will never put shampoo on my hair again.</li>
    <li> I love Deva products, but this No Poo DevaCare Cleanser is too heavy for my fine hair. I would like to return the remaining product and exchange.</li>
    <li> At first I was LOVING this cleanser, however, after several months of use, it made my hair dull and damaged. My stylist ordered me to quit using this at once, and I have seen great improvement. (I now use the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Super Slip Sudsy Shampoo)  However, I do use the DevaCare One Condition, No-Fade Ultra Creamy, and have for years, that is why I thought the cleanser would be a big win for me too. Unfortunately, not.</li>
    <li> Love the Deva Curl line. Only need to use this once a week, the big bottle lasts a long time. I know many people complain about the smell, but I like it.</li>
    <li> Love love love. Nothing else on the market like this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for curls!!</li>
    <li> Love the product and would never use any other product to cleanse my hair</li>
    <li> this is the best for curly hair.you have me now.</li>
    <li> I totally love this shampoo.  I have been using for over a month now.  my hair is never frizzy or dry.  Always feels smooth and full of body.  I don&#x27;t think I have had a bad hair day since.  I color my hair and if definitely seems like the color holds better.  I am recommending it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> Feels like conditioner because it is a non-lathering hair cleanser.  I use it more for cleansing the scalp than the hair because my arc angell gel is removed so nicely with water.  It has a pleasant citrus smell and is sulfate free so it is gentle on your color.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo for curly hair!  Very quick ship!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it works just as well as Wen, if not better, on my hair. I recommend it to everyone I know</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my curly hair, but continued to use it after getting a Brazilian Blowout.  Since it&#x27;s sulfate free, it&#x27;s perfect for after getting the BB, but much less expensive than the BB brand shampoo.  I like the smell of the &amp;#34;DevaCare&amp;#34; version much better than the DevaCurl No-Poo.  After about a year of using this, my hairdresser has even commented on how incredibly healthy my hair is.  The only downside is that it does not get my hair as clean as traditional shampoo, so I do have to wash everyday.  But, hey, at least I&#x27;m not damaging my hair in the process.</li>
    <li> Sulfate free shampoos, botanical conditioners, alcohol free gels - make for healthy, happy and hydrated hair.  This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> As I said with the condioner, Deva products have really changed the texture of my hair and made it possible for my curls to really come out and stay out. Other shampoos really turn my hair to straw.</li>
    <li> I stopped shampooing my hair 2 years ago, opting for a no-lather cleansing conditioner routine instead. I have long, straight, color-treated, fine hair. Anyone with this combination knows how hard it is to keep this kind of hair healthy-looking and clean. I&#x27;ve tried several other cleansing conditioning products, this being the last one and highly recommended by a hair-dresser friend of mine. I LOVE this stuff. My color lasts longer, my hair stays cleaner and less weighed down between cleanings(about 2-3 a week), my scalp is healthy, and the fragrance is wonderful. I&#x27;ve had no trouble at all with this, even though it&#x27;s formulated for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying Deva Curl shampoo which I have used for several years with great results.  This stuff leaves my hair heavy and gunked up.  It&#x27;s false advertising as I thought I was ordering something different.  Be warned.  This is NOT the same shampoo.  DevaCare vs. Deva Curl? hmmm</li>
    <li> Great product - why have I been using regular shampoo all these years?  Really cleans your hair but does not strip away natural oils.  My only suggestion is to make the opening a little wider, the product is very thick and makes it difficult to squeeze through the small spout.</li>
    <li> I prefer the DevaCARE One Condition as it is thicker and lasts longer than the DevaCURL One Condition, so I decided to try the &#x27;matching&#x27; No Poo.  I really like it, my hair feels clean, not stripped and most importantly, my scalp feels very clean as well.  Fast shipping &amp; authentic Deva product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started using conditioner like products to wash my hair and it works very well.  It has a nice aroma and the price is great.  It will last a long time.</li>
    <li> love the product, does not damage hair, keeps it hydrated</li>
    <li> Love product but wish it had a pump, so thick hard too squeeze out. Tried recycling old pump  did not work</li>
    <li> This shampoo left my hair dry and with a weird coating on it. My hair is damaged from coloring - this my have been the problem</li>
    <li> i have been using deva products for 13 years and love them.  no harsh chemicals.  gets my tangles out.  smells good and cleanses scalp.</li>
    <li> I have given away this poltoduct to many people and all so far have raving reviews. Many hair stiylist are concidering selling it since their customer have been using it. A must buy!</li>
    <li> Have used DevaCare Cleanser for a few years now and really like the product.  It cleans well and leaves both my hair and grand daughters hair soft and tangle free.  Other reviews have said it did not clean well, but you have to use lots of water while cleansing.  Add some every now and then while working DevaCare through your hair. You can feel your hair getting clean and soft while doing this.  Be sure to rinse well. It is also really good for color treated hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I have Shirley Temple naturally curly hair that gets dry and frizzy. I am on major medications now and a few years ago much of my hair fell out due to illness and some awful pills I had to quit taking. I couldn&#x27;t wash my hair often or color treat it for a long time. Now, years later - it&#x27;s all grown back in and long. But I couldn&#x27;t find what to use on it that was economical and really clean product. This had really high level reviews. I used it for the first time today and I love how soft and manageable my hair is. There is no frizz, I was able to comb thru it wet with a wide-toothed comb and let it dry naturally up in a bun. I didn&#x27;t bother styling it and when I let it down - it was beautiful like I had styled it that way on purpose. No muss, no frizz, no odor, and I am now a fan. Try it.</li>
    <li> Nice gentle cleanser.</li>
    <li> I was shocked at how fast this destroyed my scalp and how dry my hair was.  I bought it because of the people raving how healthy their scalp and hair felt and even the claims that it made their eczema feel better, which I&#x27;ve dealt with on and off for a few years now.  Within 3 days of use my scalp was itching and flaking like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I stopped using it and went back to using my wife&#x27;s Hair One again, which was working fine before but just feels like it takes forever to rinse out. Will have to keep looking for awhile longer I guess.</li>
    <li> I love this for my wavy hair and it does not fade my highlights.</li>
    <li> Its important to me to use sulfate free products. One of my friends who was a hair stylist suggested this as an alternative to Wen. I really enjoy it. I have been using it on and off for a couple years now. It really does help my hair have those beachy waves. I also like that my fine hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy the day after washing. I can wash my hair every 2-3 days before it looks a hot mess. Also if you&#x27;re not into cancer and looking for paraben free products, buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From their website&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;DevaCurl is a 100% sulfate, paraben and silicone free system for curly, wavy and chemically dehydrated hair\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my naturally curly hair. Smells amazing!  Doubt I will ever try another poo again. I love deva products, but these ones made for color treated hair smell the best.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I usually have a very dry scalp and curly hair in the winter, but this shampoo soothes my skin and hair, keeps them well hydrated. It takes a few uses before the scalp gets accustomed to not being washed with foaming shampoo. It would be great if it could be made without artificial ingredients (colors, etc)</li>
    <li> I love using this shampoo.  It works great on my curly hair, keeping it clean and moisturized.  Lots of shine with curls in tact.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lifelong battle with thick, curly, tending to frizz hair.  I finally found a curly/thick hair expert stylist, and 5 years later, she&#x27;s finally gotten my hair looking great, with the curl very nice and lying down fairly well.  I&#x27;m able to wear it longer than I ever have, and my hair is nearly to my waist when I straighten it.  However, I&#x27;ve been having a difficult time trying to balance frizz versus over-oily products. Additionally, my scalp is always itchy to distraction, prone to serious flaking, and sometimes even bleeds from me scratching it so hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helped immensely to shampoo only my scalp, and condition only the bottom portion of my hair, but the itching persisted.  I thought maybe it was because I often wear my hair up, and it literally can take days to dry that way.  My stylist starting using this product, and used it on me the last time I went in for a cut.  OMG!  She even decided to leave it in my hair rather than rinse it out.  No joke, I actually felt the tingling and could tell in a second where she missed a spot.  It was such a wondrous, immediate relief from the itching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this right away to use at home, and have not been disappointed.  Before, even scrubbing for 10 minutes with medicated shampoos would do nothing other than make the itch worse.  Usually, the hair on my scalp doesn&#x27;t tend to curl as much as the lower portion, so I end up with a slight plastering of flat hair on my scalp.  Not with this stuff!  The hair near my scalp is now full of body, wavy, softer than it&#x27;s ever been before, and literally, 90% relief from the awful itching.  For normal use, I use this liberally on just my scalp, massage it in very well, and rinse it out.  I condition only the ends of my hair.  Something about this product just allows it to penetrate the hair near the scalp like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s not for everyone, but it&#x27;s been a miracle for me!</li>
    <li> Love Deva Care products for curly hair.</li>
    <li> If you could literally fall in love with a shampoo, this is it for me. GONE is my dry flyaway hair from over coloring and in its place is naturally silken strands.</li>
    <li> Hair is very different, now.  Softer, less brittle.  Wish I&#x27;d learned of the difference this shampoo can make much sooner.  My color is also much more vibrant than with other shampoos.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I keep experimenting with sulfate free shampoos in order to accommodate a sensitivity to sulfates, not to preserve hair color.  Of the ones I have tried (Brazilian Blowout brand, Moroccan oil brand, LOreal, and Wen), this one was the most disappointing.  Noticeably duller looking hair was apparent after the first shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;One month later: I handed shampoo off to friend with twin adopted daughters from Ethiopia.  It works very well on their extremely curly hair.  It really enhances their ringlets.</li>
    <li> I have been using Deva Curl for about a year and love it!  I do color and highlight my hair so decided to give Deva Care a try to protect my color ( although Deva Curl might be gentle enough ) I find that with Deva Care, I need to use a conditioner, as it is not as moisturizing.  It also doesn t have that same wonderful scent that Deva Curl has.  I think I shall return to Deva Curl!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Nothing else works better for curly hair. Would recommend this to anyone with frizzy or curly hair. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great, lightweight cleaning that enables my fine curls to look their best.  Smells great, too.  Keeps those curls from becoming limp and weighed down.</li>
    <li> Exceptional hair cleanser.  Deva No Poo makes my hair feel thicker and so much softer.  It adds shine to your hair.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this from Amazon, but at a brick and mortar beauty store.  I found the smell truly nauseating.  I would call it a mix of cotton candy and baby powder.  Normally smelly products do not bother me as it washes out.  The smell of this stays on the hair even after applying other products such as a different brand of conditioner, finishing oil and hair spray.  I would suggest smelling it at the store(U--a).  If you like the smell and think you could stand it all day and night on your hair try it.  I am giving it 3 stars because having only used it one time I can not fairly attest to how it works on the hair.</li>
    <li> It has gluten in it. I bought it (not paying attention, MY FAULT) and it has gluten in it. I can&#x27;t use it. And it smells kind of funky. I am not really an &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; person but I didn&#x27;t find myself enjoying how my hair smelled after just shampooing. (I used it 3x before seeing the gluten).</li>
    <li> I purchased the 32 oz bottle of DevaCare No-Poo along with the same sized bottle of DevaCare conditioner.  The No-Poo was not filled to the top of the bottle like the conditioner.  In addition the bottle of conditioner was completely wrapped in plastic while the No-Poo simply had a piece of tape over the cap.  Either this product was resold to me after someone else tried it and returned it or it was siphoned off.  If it didn&#x27;t come the day before leaving on vacation and if I wasn&#x27;t low on my other bottle, I would have returned it.  Not cool to sell a bottle that is not full.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge DevaCurl fan. I only have &amp;#34;swavy&amp;#34; hair as they classify it, but nothing brings out the potential of my hair like DevaCurl does. I was using regular DevaCurl, but my mom accidentally ordered me DevaCare, which is the same company, but DevaCare is so much creamier and just awesome.</li>
    <li> I started using DevaCare/DevaCurl products and I can honestly say these products saved my curls! Before using these products my hair was either crunchy because of all of the product I had to put in it to control the frizz or out of control frizzy. Since using these products, my hair has never looked and felt this great! A lifesaver for all types of curly hair.</li>
    <li> I like this as a Wen alternative, though I will still use Wen - this is great for using on my child and myself when looking for a lighter scent alternative and cheaper!!</li>
    <li> The best shampoo for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Timely delivery and undamaged</li>
    <li> This is a marvelous shampoo! the slip is a-ma-ziiiiiiing! Smell is fine, citrusy but not overpowering, leaves a decent clean scent. DO also get the conditioner, using both of these have cut my detangle time in over half! Will be buying more, wish it was on subscribe and save. Further note that there are no pumps with these bottles. Really wish they came with. Had to buy my own.</li>
    <li> From the first time I used it I was incredibly impressed how my 3a/b hair responded.  Unlike products like Wen and some of the coconut oil based products, my hair also actually felt clean when I used it.  But the smell? Really bad.  Like rotten creamsickles.  Really, it is a total downer in the shower to have to smell it.  Good thing is most of us use some other product afterwards, so you don&#x27;t leave the shower smelling horrible.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product hoping to find an alternative to the high-priced Wen shampoo, but the search continues. The smell is strong, but I don&#x27;t hate it (I don&#x27;t love it either). It just doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with as nice of a texture as Wen. I have extremely straight, fine hair, and didn&#x27;t find that this weighed my hair down or made it greasy at all. It just wasn&#x27;t as soft and didn&#x27;t stay as tangle-free as it does with Wen.</li>
</ol>
