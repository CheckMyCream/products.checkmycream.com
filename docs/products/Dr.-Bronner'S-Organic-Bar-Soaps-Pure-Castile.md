    <li> This is a great alternative to use as a makeup brush cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful and is much cheaper than the beauty blender cleaner (with a TON more product). It&#x27;s also really easy to use -- you just swirl your brushes on top of the soap and run it under water.</li>

    <li> Amazing product, and smells heavenly!! I use tgis to make my homeade laundry detergent an it works great an smells great too!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use bar soap as it dries out my skin. This soap is great, it doesn&#x27;t dry me out and it has a very pleasant lavender scent. I may never use another soap.</li>
    <li> This is, without question, the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  Had it two weeks and have used it as face soap, hand soap, shampoo, and bath soap.  I just ordered 6 bars of the Baby Soap for my husband and granddaughter, both of whom have very sensitive skin.  Since using Dr Bronner&#x27;s, I no longer have to slather on lotion!  Not on my hands and not after a shower.  My thumbs and first fingers were always very dry and rough - every fall, the skin would split and stay that way all winter (band-aids for months).  Based on how much better my hands are, already, I&#x27;m not expecting that to happen this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be TMI, but all my life I&#x27;ve had a problem with perspiration odor.  I&#x27;ve tried everything I could find - all kinds of soaps, deodorants, salt deodorant, shampoo as a body soap, prescription anti-bacterial wash, etc.... Nothing ever took away all the odor.  No one ever mentioned that there was problem, but I always felt like I&#x27;d just come from the gym.  Now, it&#x27;s gone!!!  Used this soap and it was amazing and I hadn&#x27;t even expected that to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer for life, that&#x27;s me!</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 bars of this soap in the lavender fragrance to give as gifts for my cousins who have sensitive skin... Opened the package and immediately knew I needed to order more for my husband and I! These smell so amazingly good and super fresh!! If you like lavender, you&#x27;ll love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paraben free is a must in our household with cancer on both sides of the family. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a good brand we know we can trust. These bars are larger than other natural brand soaps we&#x27;ve purchased and will last nicely. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> The most wonderful soap, the smell is nice but not strong or offensive, leave  the body soft and clean!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased their liquid soap several times before which I have enjoyed, but this was my first time ordering a bar of soap for the bath.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t explain it but I prefer the bar soap over the liquid soap. My skin feels sooo clean and it is such a nice feeling , it smells nice and I am ordering another bar of soap right now.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with lavender if it is your first time trying this soap.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, which I absolutely love. I&#x27;m personally not to crazy about the scent, but still like the soap. I will be ordering more for sure.</li>
    <li> I llve this stuff, leaves my skin feeling clean! And the smell lasts for ever! The send was prompt and my soap came very quickly! At a great price, who can beat it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very gentle and natural soap! It&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin :)</li>
    <li> Love the smell awesome in making laundry soap</li>
    <li> Seems like a lot to pay for one bar of soap, but it lasts longer than three or four bars of regular soap. Got here on time.</li>
    <li> Im a huge fan of all of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products. I simply love this company. This was my first time buying this bar in this scent and it is perfection. I wash my baby girl in it every night and she loves it! I love being able to actually trust a company to not cover my child in chemical laden products!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great - very calming. Lots of suds. I like it better than the popular tea tree soap, which I also like.</li>
    <li> Great smell, all natural</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this soap. I have switched to using only this soap for a body wash and hair wash. The bars last so much longer than any of the commercial soaps on the market and they don&#x27;t leave your skin feeling tight wand dried out. All of the different scents smell great, just pick one you like and bath time will be a much more pleasant time for you and your family. This is a great product and once you try it you wont want to bathe with anything else.</li>
    <li> I know this soap is expensive, however... This soap is amazing!  If you like lavender scent, then this is the soap for you.  What&#x27;s best is it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.  It also perfumes your whole bathroom as it sits in your soap dish.  Just take a look at the ingredients I&#x27;ve listed below and you&#x27;ll see that this soap is purely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to list some of the information on the bar (as well as ingredients in case you have any known allergies):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-One Hemp LAVENDER PURE - CASTILE SOAP MADE WITH ORGANIC OILS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:  Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Palm Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Water, Lavandin Extract, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Fair Deal Hemp Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Lavender Extract, Sea Salt, Citric Acid, Tocopherol</li>
    <li> Not buying more of this. Great lather and clean feeling but too pricey.</li>
