      <li>It&#x27;s very good, works fast...</li>
      <li>So far it has been working great!</li>
      <li>most amazing stuff.</li>
      <li>I have tried all kinds of eczema lotion and this is by far the best for my skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the prescription lotions because I feel it does more damage than good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
      <li>My son&#x27;s skin condition has been getting better ever sice</li>
      <li>LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I love that it has no scent....</li>
      <li>/&gt;After continuing to do more research I came across MetaDerm.</li>
      <li>I even took it to my dermatologist and told him it worked better than the hydrocortisone he recommended.</li>
      <li>my skin keeps getting better with continued use.</li>
      <li>I still have some issues, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>My son and I love this product.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I took it with me...</li>
      <li>It has been about a month and his skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>I have waited to write a review until I knew for sure that it wasn&#x27;t a fluke, but this cream has changed my son&#x27;s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Both boys love it put it on by themselves, &amp;</li>
      <li>and I have found nothing that will get rid of it except warmer, more humid weather.</li>
      <li>I figure I must be allergic to one or more of the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I tried this because I read so many rave reviews and was hoping it&#x27;d be the \\&quot;miracle\\</li>
      <li>so it won&#x27;t irritate your Psoriasis any more than it already is.</li>
      <li>I love it and arrived as promised.</li>
      <li>&quot; many claimed it was for my eczema.</li>
      <li>Better than some of the heavier grease type.  </li>
      <li>This allows the moisturizer to heat up which absorbs in your skin better.</li>
      <li>After a week of that, I tried the MetaDerm one more time, thinking that now that my skin was better condition, it would finally be able to help.</li>
      <li>I would give this 4 stars if it was more hydrating</li>
      <li>We also use the lavender body wash, esp on my newborn, and it smells so good and is very gentle and not drying.</li>
      <li>This MetaDerm is soothing and seems to work pretty good.  </li>
      <li>At first, when nothing was happening, I thought I should give it time; after all, it does say \\&quot;optimum results in 12 weeks.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>It is a wonderful product not just for psoriasis but for dry skin as well.</li>
      <li>For that reason, this moisturizer has been a product that I&#x27;ve had to continue purchasing (hope it never gets discontinued), since nothing else have seemed to work as great on my highly sensitive &amp; allergy-prone skin type.</li>
      <li>this product is definitely worth trying I&#x27;m very happy that this is an honest product I hope this company gets more recognition down the road!</li>
      <li>Cycle this every couple of weeks with other products (Aveeno cream and the triple paste) and that approach seems to work best for our kiddo, who has eczema, rather than fixate on just one brand.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle &amp; thus far is working great!</li>
      <li>It works so quickly!  </li>
      <li>Only caveat - wish it had a slightly more pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>It sinks into your skin quick, no burn feel, perfect consistency.    </li>
      <li>I have always been a huge fan of the original formula, but I love this new formula even better!  </li>
      <li>The lotion itself is thick but non-greasy, does not have a strong fragrance, and is quite pleasant, not to mention effective!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fast absorbing cream and not greasy what so ever which is totally great</li>
      <li>My skin really has a glow to it and feels really nice on the skin.</li>
      <li>As a massage therapist who has been exposed to a lot of hand washing and years of exposure to creams with preservatives and alcohols in them it was extremely important to me to find something that would heal my hands for once and for all.  </li>
      <li>So far this product is the most effective lotion that i</li>
      <li>My eczema is mild and infrequent, but if it helped me that quickly, I imagine it would work well for people who have more severe cases</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t disappear, but it has reduced the flare ups significantly.  </li>
      <li>it is so nice to have a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t tacky, or oily and that actually makes my skin feel so much better...</li>
      <li>Metaderm is a great product for anyone with psoriasis or verb just dry skin!</li>
      <li>I bought the full line of MetaDerm products including the foaming cleanser, cream and spray.</li>
      <li>I have been using metaderm for more than 6 months and it helps my severe psoriasis so much.</li>
      <li>In comparison to the baby formula that I&#x27;ve tried in this version, this product seems much thicker -- more like a cream, oppose to just a moisturizing lotion.</li>
      <li>Its not at all greasy, oily and doesn&#x27;t really feel like a lotion but more of a balm when it dries.</li>
      <li>Then I started taking oatmeal baths and it was amazing how quickly my eczema improved, though of course still not cleared up completely.</li>
      <li>Though what I suffer was never identified as either eczema nor psoriasis,  MetaDerm still helps tremendously.</li>
      <li>I have been using it mainly on my legs, as that is where most of my psoriasis is located and also where my skins seems to get the driest.</li>
      <li>Although I still have a way to go with getting my skin back to its pre-eczema stage, I have the confidence knowing that these products will continue to work their magic!</li>
      <li>I am beyond happy and relieved that I found this through other positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
      <li>In many years from now, we will find there to be many different causes of \\&quot;eczema\\&quot; (which itself is many different things).</li>
      <li>I rarely get any flare-ups on my face since switching to this.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Totally Excellent!  Highly recommended! Tried so many options of other products with little to no relief.  Thrilled to find this company &amp; all their wonderful products!</li>
    <li> I tried this because I read so many rave reviews and was hoping it&#x27;d be the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; many claimed it was for my eczema. At first, when nothing was happening, I thought I should give it time; after all, it does say \\&quot;optimum results in 12 weeks.\\&quot; But no matter how much I used, my skin was still dry and cracked. Then one night I took some advice to keep my skin coated overnight and wrap with a breathable bandage. Well...I woke up to awful pain in my eczema, my skin peeling and oozing... I stopped using MetaDerm and switched to Aveeno (once the top layer of my skin grew back!). At that point halfway up my arm was all red and disgusting, doubling in size from what it&#x27;d been and much more irritated. Then I started taking oatmeal baths and it was amazing how quickly my eczema improved, though of course still not cleared up completely. After a week of that, I tried the MetaDerm one more time, thinking that now that my skin was better condition, it would finally be able to help. Well...ONE application of MetaDerm, and my skin is back to being dry and cracked! Now I&#x27;m back at square one trying to remoisturize and get my skin back to how it was a week ago. I hate to leave negative reviews for anything, but I wanted to make others aware that sometimes this product is not always the wonderful item people say it is. I&#x27;m very happy that it&#x27;s helped so many, as eczema and psoriasis are hell to deal with, trying product after product and hoping for the best. But sadly for me, MetaDerm has only made my problem worse.</li>
    <li> absolutely the best product ( including prescription medications ) ever !!!  improvement occurred in less that 2 weeks and I will continue to use in the future !!!!!</li>
    <li> I have suffered with Seborrheic Dermatitis for years but recently, the flaking and the redness from flare ups would get worse. I would spend hours online looking for the right moisturizer to help stop the redness while getting rid of the flakes. Every lotion, cream and/or moisturizer I bought would either help with one or just not help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After continuing to do more research I came across MetaDerm. This is the BEST one out of all of them. This is the ONLY moisturizer I have used that keeps my flare-ups in check while also getting rid of my facial flakes. I rarely get any flare-ups on my face since switching to this. It has been a life saver. With any other lotion I would have to constantly check on my face because although it was “moisturized” I would still get flakes which is embarrassing to say the least. I am so happy to have come across this. I couldn’t even grow out my facial hair because of the flakes. I would have to shave immediately. With MetaDerm I can grow it out or just wait to shave a little longer because of how well it keeps me flake free. Please give this a shot. If you’re like my trying everything and anything then give this a shot. You might be just as surprised as me.</li>
    <li> Works great for my  infants mild excema</li>
    <li> It kind a work for me beca use sometida it didint stop the itchying and the redness</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of eczema lotion and this is by far the best for my skin. In just one week and about 2-3 times application a day, my eczema got cleared. So far this product is the most effective lotion that i used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will see in the long run if this lotion will continue to heal my eczema.</li>
    <li> This cream is very thick, and feels good going on, and is the only homeopathic eczema remedy I have found.  But, if applied liberally to my back, as the directions indicate, my clothes stick to me, which is a very uncomfortable feeling.  And, of course, it leaves a residue on my clothing.  It does help the eczema, but only holding it at bay, not clearing it up.  It is seasonal based (winter) and I have found nothing that will get rid of it except warmer, more humid weather.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this cream because it is thick and it will not grease up your hands. I wash my hands all day due to my occupation. I tend to be very dry due to this. This product does not grease up my hands making my life easier due to not having to worry about having things slip out of my hands. My hands are also moisturized without having me need to reapply for a good part of the day. I would say a good 8 - 10 hours before i need to put it on again. I recommend it for people with very dry hands and need some relief.</li>
    <li> Recently received this moisturizer in the mail...I have used Metaderm&#x27;s other psoriasis moisturizer and I love it...this one is equally good, but its effects last a little longer. I have been using it mainly on my legs, as that is where most of my psoriasis is located and also where my skins seems to get the driest. I apply it twice a day...I love that it has no scent....I find that perfumed lotions just end up being over powering...this cream is completely neutral and so does not compete with any other scented products you might want to wear such as perfume or cologne. Since I have been using Metaderm&#x27;s moisturizers, not only is my psoriasis much improved, but so is my skin where there is no psoriasis....so even if I did not have psoriasis, I would still use this product...not sure I could live without it now! I also recently had an appointment with my dermatologist and when I showed her my legs she was really surprised and wanted to know what I had been doing since my last visit with her. I told her the only thing I had ben doing differently was adding Metaderm to my routine and she told me that it was definitely helping and to continue using it!    Sept 23rd 2014    Just updating...I recently took a trip home to the UK where my psoriasis had a flare...probably because of change of climate, or stress or who knows what...but even though this moisturizer couldn&#x27;t prevent that from happening, it absolutely did help my skin from completely drying out and cracking...I am so glad I took it with me...it is so nice to have a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t tacky, or oily and that actually makes my skin feel so much better...now I am back in the US and in my normal routine, my skin is calming down, but I could not be without this moisturizer.......it&#x27;s a definite keeper for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for 20yrs. My dermatologist refused to give me something hat would indefinitely. He had me on Clobetosol. 05% ointment and it took a little while for me to start see any results. It was like trying to heal with Neosporin on. It made me itchy and I would dig with that on til I bled. With this, (and I&#x27;ve been using this for only a few days 2x a day as directed) I haven&#x27;t been itchy, its calming and that lasts all day, the redness is hardly there, there&#x27;s no perfume or odor which is a plus because any lotion containing perfume and/or alcohol will activate your symptom and this stuff dries up almost instantly but trust me it stays on all day. Its not at all greasy, oily and doesn&#x27;t really feel like a lotion but more of a balm when it dries. A little bit goes a long way but if your like me and have this similar symptom almost all over your body I recommend highly to get the big 32oz tube. I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t now. But I certainly will soon.</li>
    <li> Keeps my eczema hydrated all day long...better than any other lotion. Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other lotions. My redness has lessened but not gone away completely...dryness and itchiness is gone though. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year and will keep buying this. I have eczema all over my legs and feet. It is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my skin.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing with dry skin &amp; psoriasis.  I like the scent &amp; use it from head to toe to prevent winter itch &amp; dryness.</li>
    <li> I have already written a review about the MetaDerm cream and soap but wanted to pay attention to the difference of this dry skin eczema and psoriasis cream.  I used this one specifically for both of my hands, who have gone through years of dermatitis and pharmaceutical extra strength cortisone creams.  I was and the end of my rope fighting this battle with my super sensitive hands. I need to use gloves when using detergents, soap even shampoos of any kind. As a massage therapist who has been exposed to a lot of hand washing and years of exposure to creams with preservatives and alcohols in them it was extremely important to me to find something that would heal my hands for once and for all.  As soon as I started washing my hands with metaderm soap my damaged skin started to exfoliate. As soon as I would apply this soothing cream to them after washing, the skin would calm down and continue to exfoliate but not feel dry anymore. Only after 10 days of using this cream my hands have now stopped to exfoliate and are revealing new skin underneath all of that damaged skin. I was truly concerned about my need for the extra strength cortisone cream from my dermatologist and am now happy to say that I am certain that I will  never need to apply that harsh ointment again. I am so very grateful for this healing cream and for MetaDerm&#x27;s products.  This is not some kind of info-mercial but simply the report of a very grateful customer. D.H.</li>
    <li> Works well and is helpful with psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about six weeks and I do begin to see some improvement and I do like the feel of the cream on my hands.  It&#x27;s non greasy and doesn&#x27;t have that cloying feeling that many extra moisturizing creams have.  As my Psoriasis is on my hands, I use the product far more often than twice a day and find that I go through a tube every couple of weeks.  But for the comfort it gives to my constantly cracking hands - it&#x27;s worth it.  Fingers crossed for continued improvement as I approach the 12 weeks of use they recommend with this product.</li>
    <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized unlike the other body lotion I normally use. My skin is so dry I want my skin to feel hydrated. It seems I wasted money on buying two because it hasn&#x27;t been three weeks and I&#x27;m already on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This really helps keep my daughter&#x27;s eczema under control.  It didn&#x27;t disappear, but it has reduced the flare ups significantly.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> pricey, yes, but comparable to other similar products.  I have tried other brands for a condition I have on my hands.  Turns red, gets hot, like a fever then maybe a blister then after all that, a couple of days my hand begins to peel and itch.  This MetaDerm is soothing and seems to work pretty good.  Better than some of the heavier grease type.  This condition seems to come and go.  A friend of mine has this same condition, but it is on his face, ouch, and the dermatologist and his doctor say it is some kind of allergy.  I had a different condition before, where my hands became tough and hard and the skin really thick and cracking -- real sore. I went to a dermatologist and he told me it was a psoriasis/eczema and got me to using the heavy creams -- one even had the smell of axle grease, ha, ha. What is going on now is different.  My skin scales, or peels very thin, not like the hard and heavy thick skin.  Anyway, this MeatDerm seems to be the answer while waiting out the healing process of the body.  The Doctors have not clue, they can tell you what they think but really have no answers for this.</li>
    <li> It works so quickly!  I can&#x27;t believe it!  If nothing works, try this organic cream. It&#x27;s rich and effect even for my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> My 3 year old had eczema. I bought every cream on the market and even got some prescription samples from our pediatrician, then I tried meta derm cream.  Within 3 days his eczema was gone. I started using it all over his body and his dry skin looks so healthy. It is not greasy and would be great for newborns as well. My hands have become so soft from applying it to him. I am going to switch our entire family to meta derm.</li>
    <li> This product is thick and has no smell which is great so it won&#x27;t irritate your Psoriasis any more than it already is. It&#x27;s fast absorbing cream and not greasy what so ever which is totally great so it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes or bed sheets.</li>
    <li> I have to say that whatever it was that was causing my face to burn, itch and turn red is gone.  It only took a few days and I can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin feels.  I will never be without this cream.</li>
    <li> Cleared everything in about a week, I used the spray in the morning and the cream at night... Usually I have reactions and burning sensation with lotions but not with this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for 25 years that for the past year has started spreading. I&#x27;ve been avoiding medications but have tried every over-the-counter cream, oil, supplement I&#x27;ve ever come across. This is the only thing that works! It&#x27;s incredible! I immediately noticed a difference, but when I went away for the weekend and forgot my MetaDerm Hyper-Moisurizing Cream, wow, I knew I had to write a review. Without it, my skin flared so badly that I was in incredible pain from the raw, red, inflamed skin--and everything else I slathered on it this weekend just made it worse. But as soon as I came home and could slather on my MetaDerm Hyper-Moisurizing Cream, my skin immediately calmed down, cooled down, and the redness went away. When it gets this bad, I tend to use the cream every hour or so as it absorbs into my skin just to keep the flaring down. But once the flaring is down, applying just morning and night works fine. It is a nice, thick cream, but it absorbs really well. I even use it on my face and don&#x27;t have issues with it clogging pores or applying makeup over it. As soon as I submit this review, I&#x27;m going to purchase other products in the MetaDerm line--can&#x27;t wait to try them!</li>
    <li> It honestly works at first I was losing a bit of hope due to the fact that I was almost to the 12 week mark and stuff was not  really changing but a bit after 12 weeks eczema improved!! It&#x27;s been very good my eczema rarely comes back and when it does it&#x27;s so tiny and it goes away by the end of the day this product is definitely worth trying I&#x27;m very happy that this is an honest product I hope this company gets more recognition down the road!</li>
    <li> We have been using your product for 4 weeks now and LOVE it! We are currently using the Hyper-Moisturizing lotion. Both boys love it put it on by themselves, &amp;#34;because it makes us feel good&amp;#34;! Our family HIGHLY recommends MetaDerm Organic Hyper-Moisturizing Cream!</li>
    <li> I have eczema and had high hopes for this product. Unfortunately, while it didn&#x27;t make things worse, it didn&#x27;t really do anything. It was like any other drugstore moisteriser I tried.</li>
    <li> I have waited to write a review until I knew for sure that it wasn&#x27;t a fluke, but this cream has changed my son&#x27;s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my 2 year old has severe eczema all over his entire body, from his scalp to his toes, and NOTHING I have tried for the last 2 years has helped his skin. The steroid oil from the doctor was the only thing that kept it barely under control, but it did not prevent break outs, and didn&#x27;t seem to heal anything. I have literally tried every single cream (for example the entire eucerine line, neosprorin eczema line etc), many other lotions, vinegar, sugar scrub, oil, salt bath, diet etc to help him. But it was by accident that I came across this product line after a horrific outbreak he had over this past Memorial Day weekend. I thought to myself that I didn&#x27;t have much to lose and why not try another product, even though I didn&#x27;t have much hope that it would help. So I bought the Metaderm organic hyper-moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few DAYS I saw results. His skin was soft, and the itching became much less. It has been about a month and his skin has never looked better. The bumps and cracks are healed, and not returning. He is no longer constantly itchy. I went back on Amazon and ordered the spray for his hair, and it seems to be helping there too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe it. He has had it since he was born, and I have had sleepless nights over the discomfort he has lived with every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product. I am using the least amount of the steroid oil I have since he was first prescribed it, and no longer need the multiple other lotions I had been using to try and keep his skin under control. I would highly recommend using this, it is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soothed and moisturized. I will defiantly purches this again.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really help with my skin.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly impressed by the hyper moisturizing cream. Going into trying the product, I was very skeptical. My 13 month old son has suffered with severe eczema since 4 months old. I have baskets upon baskets of products claiming to clear &amp; sooth his skin. Nothing worked....until now...we are 4 weeks in &amp; his skin is looking beautiful, he has stopped itching, &amp; doesn&#x27;t cry when I apply. It&#x27;s gentle &amp; thus far is working great! Also, meta dream as a company , is completely fabulous &amp; awesome customer care &amp; product backing!</li>
    <li> I would give this 4 stars if it was more hydrating but I found that it turns clumpy or dry after usage so I&#x27;ve tried applying it with rubbing unrefined coconut oil and the lotion to retain the moisture. HAS WORKED WONDERS!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous product---something about metaderm products makes them seem much more natural than other things I have tried ..but they deeply moisturize...you should try...</li>
    <li> This is my second time to try a Metaderm Psoriasis product and once again it is working very well. My son has some psoriasis spots on his elbows and face and they become quite itchy at times. As soon as he begins using this product the itching stops and the spots become less visible. He uses it twice a day.  I also have been using this cream on my neck and upper chest area where I have some age spots and very dry skin and I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t have any type of scent (which I like) and you really don&#x27;t need much at all to cover an area. I also have used this product on my heels (which are dry and cracked) and have noticed how much it has helped there also. I will absolutely continue to use this product and recommend it to all. It is a wonderful product not just for psoriasis but for dry skin as well.</li>
    <li> It is too early to know if this product works yet as advertised.I have a question to be answered.I had a low INR reading today and I&#x27;m checking as to what may have caused it. Corticosteroids and other medications for Eczema or Psoriasis may use ingriedients that do lower INR numbers.Question: Can Metaderm effect my INR ?</li>
    <li> It has only been a little over a month since I started using Metaderm. 2nd day of using it I noticed some improvement on my eczema. Itchiness went away, it calmed the skin down and no more redness. Itchiness however comes back and forth so I constantly apply the cream on the area. I am hoping it will completely heal but right now it is too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> This stuff amazing. My newborn&#x27;s excema and my 5 year old&#x27;s extremely dry skin both cleared up within 1 week of using. Every other organic skin cream for excema had made their skin worse and most of the time, more irritated. We had tried so many different creams/lotions. I&#x27;m not sure why this works so well, but honestly, it&#x27;s like they both have new skin. Soft and not at all irritated. We also use the lavender body wash, esp on my newborn, and it smells so good and is very gentle and not drying. But I think it&#x27;s the lotion that makes the biggest difference.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. After spending zillions of bucks on stuff that doesn&#x27;t work, very please to find this product. I started getting scaly patches on my shins, slightly itchy, but no lotion would make them go away until I found this.  Sometimes I have to use it consistently for a while to get them to go away, but sometimes even a few uses makes a huge, huge difference.  LOVE this product. Only caveat - wish it had a slightly more pleasant smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, just wish it were a tad bit more pleasant.</li>
    <li> This has been the only cream I&#x27;ve found that stops the itch of my daughter&#x27;s eczema. I just ordered my second tube. We live it so much that we refer to it as &amp;#34;the magic lotion&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s skin condition has been getting better ever sice he started using this product. And the best part is there are no side effects or any ingredients to make him tired .</li>
    <li> Its quite effective, I  adore the overall feel and texture, but it does not work overnight.  It will take some time, but you have to be consistent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. I doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin but i don&#x27;t necessarily like the feel of it.</li>
    <li> I have eyelid eczema triggered by a makeup allergy. When I have it, it is extremely painful and itchy and I have tried every lotion and cream available. I don&#x27;t like the prescription lotions because I feel it does more damage than good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - with my last bout a few months ago medi seem provided immediate relief. It&#x27;s not greasy at all (so it doesn&#x27;t look weird and it doesn&#x27;t get on my contacts) and it penetrates right away. Anyone with eyelid eczema knows how hard that it is to find. I am sure it works as well for skin issues in other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use this everyday as my normal eye cream to prevent a flair up and frankly...just because it&#x27;s a really nice cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any type of skin issue I would recommend you try this. I am beyond happy and relieved that I found this through other positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
    <li> moisturizes but very pricey for the amount you recieve</li>
    <li> It does not heal like another organic product that I use for cracked heels but it does do a good job of moisturizing. I am happy with this product as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Smells weird. Works dope tho</li>
    <li> I bought the full line of MetaDerm products including the foaming cleanser, cream and spray. I was really hoping to find something non-steroidal that would work for me. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products from other brands such as Aveeno, Cetaphil, Goldbond, Vaseline, etc. Sadly, this product is not for me, but the company will give you a full refund if you aren&#x27;t satisfied.    The initial feel of the product is pleasant, and quickly makes any present itch disappear. However, as the day goes on, even after reapplying the product, my skin would feel very dry, tight and irritated. I would feel the urge to flush the skin with lots of water (and I could feel the product washing off) and then reapply a moisturizer. After about a month, I couldn&#x27;t stand the products anymore and went back to my old moisturizer and non-soap cleanser which returned my skin back to square one. I figure I must be allergic to one or more of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> My son and I love this product. Any trouble spot almost magically disappears after only using it a couple of times. I usually cannot get my son to use any lotions because he always complains about feeling sticky afterwards, but not with MetaDerm!! He loves it and asks me to put it on any time his eczema gets itchy. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Cycle this every couple of weeks with other products (Aveeno cream and the triple paste) and that approach seems to work best for our kiddo, who has eczema, rather than fixate on just one brand.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and ecema and live in the Sonoran Desert. I would recomend this product. My skin really has a glow to it and feels really nice on the skin. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this along with the spray on my 2 year old son with Eczema for a few weeks now. And i have to say that it has really been helping him with the itching. It&#x27;s really easy to apply and not to mention its better for his skin since it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals in it that other creams have as well. Thanks Metaderm, Hoping things continue to improve over the next 10 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. After just a week of use, I notice a significant difference in my dry skin!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product.  I actually called the company to make sure I was ordering the right product. This product is the thicker of the 2 offered.  I used as directed for 3 months.  It actually started off well, but the last 2 months went downhill.  My eczema is actually worse now. :(</li>
    <li> Amazing product, amazing company. Love! Has made an enormous difference in my little girl&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good, works fast... I  don&#x27;t think I would use anything else right now</li>
    <li> In comparison to the baby formula that I&#x27;ve tried in this version, this product seems much thicker -- more like a cream, oppose to just a moisturizing lotion. Therefore, it does have an initial thickening effect upon applying it to the skin. But once dried, it feels much lighter. I like how it also doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily or shiny. And I&#x27;ve had to use it each &amp; every time my skin begins to get dry patches, but are usually diminished every time after ever use. For that reason, this moisturizer has been a product that I&#x27;ve had to continue purchasing (hope it never gets discontinued), since nothing else have seemed to work as great on my highly sensitive &amp; allergy-prone skin type.</li>
    <li> I have always been a huge fan of the original formula, but I love this new formula even better!  Non-greasy, absorbs quickly, no smell.</li>
    <li> For one who&#x27;d always had great skin for most of my life, it was disheartening to discover my issues with eczema. My once clear facial skin was becoming so problematic, I dare not leave the house without makeup to cover up my extremely dry skin and redness. I&#x27;ve tried several other creams and oils (perhaps aggravating my skin even more so); I was about to toss in the towel and make an appointment with my dermatologist, when I discovered MetaDerm and all of the positive comments about their cream and foaming cleanser. I figured I&#x27;d give these products a try as a &amp;#34;last ditch effort&amp;#34;, and I am so happy that I did! Within a mere couple of days, I began to see dramatic results; the redness disappeared, and my skin is feeling softer than it has been in quite some time. Although I still have a way to go with getting my skin back to its pre-eczema stage, I have the confidence knowing that these products will continue to work their magic! I use the foam cleanser at night before bedtime and follow up with an application of cream, and then apply another layer of cream in the morning, upon awakening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply cannot say enough about these products and encourage anyone who is at wits end with their eczema to give the MetaDerm line a try.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. This is the only moisturizer I will ever use. It sinks into your skin quick, no burn feel, perfect consistency.    If you have a rash/dermatitis that is nearly healed and done weeping, but then it gets really dry and cracks/fissures, this is the ticket. This moisturizer has no burn or medicated feel when you apply it. It sinks in without a greasy feel on your skin. This is perfect to use after treating dermatitis with calamine, which is a drying agent.    Apply this to your skin in a circular motion. This allows the moisturizer to heat up which absorbs in your skin better. The consistency is just right. I wish I ordered a two pack, because this moisturizer is way better than Gold Bond Ultimate which was go-to choice before I found this.    Rant about \\&quot;eczema\\&quot;: IMO, the term \\&quot;eczema\\&quot; has become a way for dermatologists to scam some people. In many years from now, we will find there to be many different causes of \\&quot;eczema\\&quot; (which itself is many different things). Eczema is just a lazy blanket term for when doctors don&#x27;t know what is causing your long term skin condition. Dermatitis and Eczema mean the same thing, that&#x27;s how stupid they think we are. Much of the root cause of eczema is itching dry skin. It is a cyclical problem, in some cases severe enough to where there is no cure. Hydrocortisone, which 99% of doctors &amp; dermatologists will prescribe you for dermatitis/eczema, causes skin to thin, which allows it to dry out easier, which causes eczema long term.    Thank god this s*** wasn&#x27;t snake oil.</li>
    <li> not very moisturizing and gave me a rash!</li>
    <li> This product made my psoriasis even worse.  I had new spots coming up everywhere.  It really aggravated the condition</li>
    <li> I have been using metaderm for more than 6 months and it helps my severe psoriasis so much. I have tried the hyper moisturizing cream and my skin stayed moisturized so much longer. Metaderm is a great product for anyone with psoriasis or verb just dry skin!</li>
    <li> My son who just turned one started to see signs of eczema at 4 months old. I tried everything from coconut oil, raw shea butter, etc. I decided to give this a try. I am only going on 2 weeks and I can say his skin on his legs looks the healthiest now than it has been since he was born. I will continue to use it and let everyone know how it&#x27;s working as we progress on.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I have been using this now for 2 weeks and I can see a marked improvement in my skin condition.  The soreness has gone away and the flare ups are less frequent.  I can not wait to see what the next 10 weeks will do to my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to buy this product, this is the BEST cream that I have used and I have bought a lot of different creams, this is the only one that has given me any relief to the soreness.</li>
    <li> So far it has been working great! It has been one of the only things that hasn&#x27;t caused my daughter&#x27;s skin to sting and burn. I also notice that the moisture lasts so much longer than other things I&#x27;ve tried. I have high hopes for this product!</li>
    <li> If I had a dollar for every dollar I&#x27;ve wasted on products that don&#x27;t work......&lt;br /&gt;This cream resolved the problem of my annoying eczema and much faster than promised.  I saw improvement within a few days.  It has no stickiness or unpleasant smell.  Thank You MetaDerm!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this cream for a few weeks now &amp; I love it! It works wonders ;)</li>
    <li> This cream is very effective in softening the lesions and moistens the skin very effectively. Only very small dabes are required.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I love it and arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> I almost never review products, but this worked so well I felt that I had to. I got this cream a few months ago and loved it, but then I forgot about it and stopped using it regularly. As I was leaving town for the weekend this Friday, I noticed my arm was starting to break out in bumps and patches, so I washed off the other lotion I&#x27;d applied and found the Metaderm. Within a moment of applying it, the patches were visibly calmed. A few hours later, no one but me could even tell I&#x27;d broken out. I&#x27;ve been applying it every day since and the patches are completely healed. My eczema is mild and infrequent, but if it helped me that quickly, I imagine it would work well for people who have more severe cases and I would recommend that anyone suffering from eczema should at least try it. The lotion itself is thick but non-greasy, does not have a strong fragrance, and is quite pleasant, not to mention effective!</li>
    <li> great lotion, replaces Clinique for men ultra hydrator</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used for a scaling and breaking out condition on my forehead and nose. It was getting worse over time and nothing helped significantly. Though what I suffer was never identified as either eczema nor psoriasis,  MetaDerm still helps tremendously. I rub it into the skin twice daily without fail. My dermatitis has not completely cleared up, but I would say there is a 75% improvement after about 2-1/2 months and my skin keeps getting better with continued use. I even took it to my dermatologist and told him it worked better than the hydrocortisone he recommended. Not that I expect he will start prescribing it or anything.</li>
    <li> most amazing stuff. i use it on my 1 year old and myself and it helps us so much!</li>
    <li> I still have some issues, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
</ol>
