    <li> I bought this for my mother for Christmas. It is her signature scent, and Amazon had the best price for it out of all the department stores that I checked. She was very happy with the perfume, and I was very happy with the price!</li>
    <li> Just love it.One of my favorites!</li>
    <li> I have loved this fragrance for 25 years. Even my male gynecologist commented on how good I smelled! ;) This is definately my go to fragrance- have many others but this is the best! LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> DIOR IS A WONDERFUL HOUSE OF LUXURIES .MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE FOE A DESCENT PRICE .PERFUMES AND COLOGNES PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE   BUT AMAZON CHARGES A FAIR PRICE FOR THIS PRODUCT111</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know it was for my Mon and she  has always loved this perfume and she still does.</li>
    <li> as Poison is a scent of seriousness, hardly playful or silly. It&#x27;s smell suggests a sweet sort of musk, not flowery, and a little lasts all day. It is one of the few fragrances left that is unique and can&#x27;t be confused with any other fragrance. I&#x27;ve gone through them all, and always come back to Poison. Women feel sexy with it on and men are hypnotized by the women who wear it. I have tried all the Poisons and still believe the original to be the most magical. Change to the Poison lotions in the summer, as they are softer. The perfume creats a most seductive mood in the night. I&#x27;ve worn Poison since the time it first was invented, and it still is my favorite. It is a scent any age can wear.</li>
    <li> This sent has a spicy hint of here I am</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent for decades and love it. I was disappointed that Dior has changed the shape of the bottle. The very round squat shape is much more difficult to hold and use. The somewhat taller, slimmer bottle was perfect. Like others I wonder if this could be a knock-off as the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long. I know that knock-offs are flooding our shores. How does Amazon handle this problem?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching the stores to find this product for years, thank God I finally found it!!! LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic, just as described!</li>
    <li> I love it.Came just as promised</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume at a great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked to the end of the web and this item is the best price for this size bottle. I&#x27;d buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was lethal poison, my wife has been nagging me a lot, and it&#x27;s getting really annoying. I started putting it in her drinks and food, she said that it tasted funny (which is good, because i thought it was working), and then continued to nag me about my cooking. Although, she continued to eat my poisoned meals. Sadly, this product did not work, and my wife continues to nag me a lot, this product DOES NOT WORK. I will in the future be buying my women poisoning products else where.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a decent price for my mother and she is happy with the quality.  She has been wearing this perfume for as long as I can remember.</li>
    <li> I have worn the original Poison since 1988. This is the best perfume ever marketed. When you wear it, you will get attention from the opposite sex. Should you put Poison on a sweater &amp; hang it in the closet until the next season, it will still smell of Poison. I have used Tendre Poison, Hypnotic Poison, Midnight Poison, I do like the first 2, nothing will ever compare to the original Poison. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is not a timeless classic (at least not yet), but it may turn out to be. It&#x27;s a good scent, and worth the money - at least if the special woman in your life likes it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s fabulous. I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance forever and couldn&#x27;t find it this time at my local Wal Mart. Yours was a better price.</li>
    <li> The first time I smelled Poison by Dior I was 14. I got a sample of it in a magazine. At that time in 1985 it was more expensive then it is now. Since I was only 14 the price seemed astronomical, I remember thinking I would never be able to afford it, we didn&#x27;t have much money as I was growing up. My husband, then boyfriend bought me my first bottle! I have not worn Poison in about 10 years. I used to wear it all the time. I decided to buy some as a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for myself from my husband! The price here on Amazon is quite a bit less then anywhere else! I love the amber, honey, berries and spice notes. I think Poison is and always will be a romantic classic.</li>
    <li> good price,,good gift for your lady,,great scent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not just talking about the price, either. I can&#x27;t stand Channel or pretty much any other perfume, but I like Poison. It is more floral than alcohol.</li>
    <li> Aaaaaah!  One of my favorites!!.........and at a good price too.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition</li>
    <li> Loved it. Is my favorite perfume. A sexy classy smell that everyone seems to like. It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> SHE THINKS SHE SMELLS REALLY WELL; I THINK SHE REALLY SMELLS WELL. PLAIN &amp; SIMPLE THEN, WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR?</li>
    <li> Not as good as I remember it.</li>
    <li> Great product, original :)</li>
    <li> If your significant other likes Christian Dior Women&#x27;s Poison Eau de Toilette Spray, this was a reasonable price. I will probably purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume! I can’t find anything else that is even close to this timely old fragrance. I get a lot of compliments on how “good” I smell when wear this. I hope that it is always around because I can’t wear any other fragrance without it making me physically nauseous. This was delivered very quickly.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this perfume</li>
    <li> Mom&#x27;s favorite.  Price has risen.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  It seems no one is carrying it in town and I was so afraid of losing it that I have stocked up for now.  I hate it when they discontinue something I have used for years.  I mean at least 30 years.  It is a nice scent and I get many compliments on it.  I would highly recommend getting it and if you like it, stock up.</li>
    <li> It has an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smell to it.  I would like to exchange it. It does not have the fruity smell I remember.</li>
    <li> I have loved Poison by Dior for many years, and my husband just purchased this bottle for me for Mother&#x27;s Day. It has such a soft, romantic scent to it. it is not overpowering like many perfumes; you just get a gentle whiff of it now and again throughout the day. Love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Fragrance I remember it from the early 80&#x27;s and the scent hasn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;changed at all I bought mine off of EBAY and yes it is the original scent just HATE&lt;br /&gt;too pay an higher price for the same item I was able too smell my scent all day it&lt;br /&gt;wasn&#x27;t over powering at all the way I like my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So do yourself an FAVORITE treat yourself don&#x27;t BEAT yourself.</li>
    <li> it was a real fake, i compared the smell from the ones i got from macys and fragrance.net and smells different, so disappointed, I just used this one for bathroom spray,</li>
    <li> This is. My mother&#x27;s favorite fragrance . I gave this as a present for het 60th birthday she was so happy! . This is a great perfume very unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poison is a distinctive perfume and in my opinion a masterpiece.</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute;&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> Shipping wad very fast!!! Good perfume too.</li>
    <li> I received my order very quickly and of course it smells terrific.  I would recommend this site to anyone wants to buy affordable perfume in a short amount if time.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as described and was shipped fast.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume and has for years? Glad to find it in a larger bottle than is offered at Walmart. Price is great for the larger size.</li>
    <li> Love it more than any other perfume I have used. Unique with hints of vanilla and cinnamon.</li>
    <li> So very happy about my purchase.  Was as lovely and strong as ever.  Smelt it before I took&lt;br /&gt;it from the box so there was no doubt that it was original.  Came quickly. Value for money.  LUV it!</li>
    <li> Illbe ordering som more soon the last one I boughtlasted at lest 8 months anf I wore it just about every day so love the size of this bottle:) thank you</li>
    <li> Mother was delighted with this! This is the real deal and many free samples came in for stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> My wife wears this perfume. We have four kids. You figure it out.</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  I have been wearing it for over 20 years, and I never get tired of it.  It is very hard to find in the area where I live, so please, Amazon, keep selling it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!! I&#x27;ve even bought the body soap, moisturizer cream, and the purse-size spray (not a sampler though, hmmm). I only wear four scents now, and this is numero - uno!    Try one of them, there is Poison, PURE POISON, HYPNOTIC POISON, Midnight Poison, Tendre Poison, and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s another one coming out soon!</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!!  MANY FAKES OUT THERE . ACTUALLY THIS DOESN&#x27;T LOOK LIKE THE REAL BOX TO ME SO I&#x27;M ALL SET.  DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY</li>
    <li> Excellent gift, was just what my wife wanted.  It smells great on her and I would definitly order this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this scent, haven&#x27;t worn it for over 10 years and still love it!</li>
    <li> I have always like this perfume.  But, I didn&#x27;t notice that in my excitement of finding this on Amazon, that I ordered the toilette spray.  Not as nice as the perfume for just another $20 more.  Cant return it.  So I guess lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eau de toilette is a lightly scented perfume used as a skin freshener. It is also referred to as &amp;#34;aromatic waters&amp;#34; and has a high alcohol content. ~Wikipedia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this scent I hope they never ever stop making it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Poison perfume for my wife on her birthday.  She loves the scent of Poison since it came out in the eighties.  I will continue purchasing Poison every year for my wife&#x27;s birthday. Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> great size for a gift</li>
    <li> I have used Poison for many years. I love it. It is my scent. I will keep on using it as long as I can get it.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume ever</li>
    <li> I love this perfum!  And it was delivered in a heartbeat</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my mom and the purchase and delivery of the product was pretty smoth. I received the package at home before the estimated delivery date and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the purchase -- and so is my mom!</li>
    <li> WAS new in box (NIB) and fresh so not a stale old one being passed off as new...one of my favs</li>

    <li> I have worn this fragrance for many years and I adore it.  Thank you for a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> This perfume my wife has loved since it first came out. We like the fruity grape essence. I have bought her a bottle every time she runs out. If I don&#x27;t she reminds me every day.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is not as I remember it (from 25 years ago :)  ), I do not know if they changed the formula or my change of my smell sense changed. Disappointed, I Would not buy it again.</li>
