      <li>I&#x27;ve become more concerned about wrinkles.</li>
      <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great retinol cream.</li>
      <li>My acne has since gotten much better</li>
      <li>I started three times a week worked up to five ; I have had many compliments on my skin.</li>
      <li>For me it seems to work ok.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>So far so good!  </li>
      <li>I spent more than twice this amount when I bought this from my skin care technician, so am very happy to find it on-line at this price!</li>
      <li>This product is super strong!  </li>
      <li>Definitely strong.</li>
      <li>was fine except for the this one.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of this on my skin and how quickly it absorbs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference on my skin, tighter, clearer and no pores visibility.</li>
      <li>My skin is looking smooth.</li>
      <li>With that being said, the bottle felt light</li>
      <li>I remember back when :) I was put on retin-A for acne and remained on that prescription for many, many years which has really helped my acne, particularly when I experienced cystic acne.</li>
      <li>I immediately ordered a bottle and I noticed results right away!</li>
      <li>It is very effective and it doesn&#x27;t over dry.</li>
      <li>I bought this product at a dermatologist and loved it but have now moved to a different state.  </li>
      <li>I had a reorder of 5 SkinMedica products (which I love so much) but will not</li>
      <li>I was delighted to find the same thing on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Fast Shipping love it.</li>
      <li>Instead I thought I will add  my opinion about the way the product arrived and whether it seemed authentic since there is so much discussion about those two items.  </li>
      <li>Used consistently, it helps with fine lines, skin clarity and adds radiance.</li>
      <li>Can quickly see results.</li>
      <li>My pores are smaller and my skin peels daily , which is GREAT!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used retinol before, but had to stop while I was pregnant.  </li>
      <li>great product, keeps my face nice and clear, doesn&#x27;t irritate at all, you just need a little dab</li>
      <li>Have to really avoid the sun while using to make sure you really see the results and don&#x27;t damage your skin.</li>
      <li>Just my two cents worth...</li>
      <li>I am 41 years old with quite a lot of hormonal discoloration and adult acne; I bought this product to help with the acne and hoped for the best with my other skin maladies.</li>
      <li>This product MUCH TOO STRONG for my oily, older skin.....</li>
      <li>This is a great product if your skin has been conditioned to using the lower versions of the Retinol Complex.  </li>
      <li>If there are any specials and/or coupons i can receive, I most definitely want them!</li>
      <li>I knew it when I first handled it</li>
      <li>This tightens my skin and just makes it look better -- pores look smaller --</li>
      <li>The top is different (screws on instead of being sealed shut).</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>One reviewer mentioned that this product burns the skin; if you&#x27;re not used to it and/or use it more often than directed, you will definitely get that effect.</li>
      <li>I had recently found out that pure retinol can reduce stretch marks in addition to fine lines.</li>
      <li>this product helped to resurface my facial skin and lessen the appearance of fine lines.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s light and it doesn&#x27;t burn when you&#x27;re in the red and flaky stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am really seeing a difference in my skin using skin medica products.</li>
      <li>but I cannot really attribute that to this product alone</li>
      <li>NOT SO MUCH,</li>
      <li>The product arrived in a sealed box that is identical to the ones skinmedica sells and it had a flier inside on how to enter skinmedica sweepstakes for a free TNS serum which is a current offer from skinmedica.  </li>
      <li>I have a real one from my dermatologist and compared.</li>
      <li>I ordered the  stronger strength from amazon as they did not have the .25% straight.  </li>
      <li>thanks Mom and Dad), so nothing to report there</li>
      <li>but I think for the price point and quality of this particular one</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>and I think it might be too high of a concentration.  </li>
      <li>Not too harsh for my skin... used for 2 weeks now:-)</li>
      <li>After the initial month or so of very red and flaky skin, I I emerged with the smoothest, acne free skin I&#x27;ve had since my pre-pubescent years.  </li>
      <li>It was a little strong for my face</li>
      <li>I am 38 years old and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>; I think it&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s helping with the discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sensitive skin, beware.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product, keeps my face nice and clear, doesn&#x27;t irritate at all, you just need a little dab</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this and I love it.</li>
    <li> The delivery time was the quickest I ever had. Thank you. I love this product I have been using it for about a year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many Skin Medica products over the years and my skin looks great at 45. When I wear no make-up at all, I often get carded for alcohol. However, over the years, I&#x27;ve learned that the two Skin Medica products that I can&#x27;t live without are the TNS serum and  the Age Defense Retinol Complex. My skin handles the 1.0 well, but years ago I started with .25, went up to .5 and finally hit the 1.0 potency.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a dermatologist and loved it but have now moved to a different state.  I was delighted to find the same thing on Amazon.  This time I couldn&#x27;t use the cream because my face turned very red and my skin burned after using it in the same I previously did.  Seems as though it is a different formula in the same bottle?</li>
    <li> Great product and price!</li>
    <li> This product is what is being sold at the plastic surgeon&#x27;s office. It is strong so typically you need to work your way up to using it daily. I think it&#x27;s great for drying up acne spots too.</li>
    <li> This product MUCH TOO STRONG for my oily, older skin.....If you have sensitive skin, like I do, this MAY not be the best thing for you....Still, dealer was very good about letting me return it.</li>
    <li> This is obviously old. My face has not peeled or turn red. I am most disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Repeat customer - retinol works!</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product under a week and I notice the results already. I began using it every night, however I think I will go to every other day or perhaps every 2-3 day. I note that after using it about 4 times my face feels chapped. I do like that my skin is responding to the product and seems to be working better than drug store brand exfoliators.</li>
    <li> Love it. Just had to adjust how often to use. Definitely strong. I started with .25 then .50.</li>
    <li> I am 38 years old and I have very sensitive skin. Starting to be concerned about wrinkles around my eyes. I have used this product for two weeks and I have seen results. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  I&#x27;ve tried other retinol products, but always come back to Skin Medica.  I think it&#x27;s a great product and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great retinol cream.</li>
    <li> Great addition to my TNS by Skin Medica.</li>
    <li> I ordered the  stronger strength from amazon as they did not have the .25% straight.  It was a little strong for my face so I used every other day</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve entered my 40&#x27;s I&#x27;ve become more concerned about wrinkles. I learned about this product from an Instagram blogger and I must say .... I LOVE IT!!!! I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference on my skin, tighter, clearer and no pores visibility. Highly recommend. Mind you, I&#x27;m a PRO MAKEUP ARTIST and have had my fair share of awesome skin care but this beats them all..... Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have tried other skin refining products and none really have done anything of note.  This tightens my skin and just makes it look better -- pores look smaller -- all good.  Great product.  Pricey but at least is actually WORKS!  I use it every day -- a small amount daily gives you results</li>
    <li> My skin feels smoother and looks brighter and even toned.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if your skin has been conditioned to using the lower versions of the Retinol Complex.  This is the strongest one from Skin Medica.  My skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> Skin Medica Retinol Complex works. Used consistently, it helps with fine lines, skin clarity and adds radiance. A little goes a long way, so a bottle last quite a while. There are no miracles in a jar (yet), however this product does improve the skin.</li>
    <li> I spent more than twice this amount when I bought this from my skin care technician, so am very happy to find it on-line at this price! I&#x27;m a customer for life now.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It is very effective and it doesn&#x27;t over dry.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  May skin has improved so much, and I attribute it the Retinol Complex.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products for the fight against wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping love it.</li>
    <li> Worked almost too well.  Sensitive skin, beware.</li>
    <li> good product used for years, good price, got it right away as listed</li>
    <li> Did not come in box and was NOT the actual cream that I purchased from the medical spa</li>
    <li> this product helped to resurface my facial skin and lessen the appearance of fine lines.  As I am out of my cream, i need to order today.  If there are any specials and/or coupons i can receive, I most definitely want them!</li>
    <li> The price and the product are great!</li>
    <li> Yes really love it !!!</li>
    <li> product came on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> I have been a die hard user of Skin Medica Tri-Retinol Complex. When that product got discontinued I ordered Retinol Compex 1.0&lt;br /&gt;The first usage burned my skin creating horrible dry spots. Then I reduced usage, but still burned and damaged my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is super strong!  I don&#x27;t have problem skin.  I think this is for someone that needs a deep peel.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling w/hormonal acne for the past year or so and needed topical skin repair remedies to speed my healing process.&lt;br /&gt;One of the topicals I needed was a Retin A. I went to my dermatologist office and requested one without a prescription. She suggested this but I did not want to spend $100. So, after research I purchased this one from here for HALF the price and it works GREAT! I use it every other day and I apply it AFTER I massage coconut oil on my skin at night. My pores are smaller and my skin peels daily , which is GREAT! I have only been using it for a week and a half to two weeks. Also, this seller shipped my item within two days! I will be buying another bottle just to have so I NEVER go without!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate if you want youthful skin. Retin A is a must, especially for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Made my skin break out. :(</li>
    <li> Great stuff, a retinal, so it will make you peel, but you just have to get thru that phase. I use it regularly and get a lot if compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> The product itself is amazing, feels like silk and my skin loves it. With that being said, the bottle felt light and I had problems getting the serum out of the spout. I went to reorder tonight and read reviews about bottles being only half full and having a drilled hole on the bottom of the bottle. I got up to check all of mine and every other SkinMedica bottle was fine except for the this one. I knew it when I first handled it but you never want to believe that you have purchased something that has been tampered with. I had a reorder of 5 SkinMedica products (which I love so much) but will not but again until Amazon fixes this issue since they fulfill the orders. It is a matter of health, if something drilled into the bottle to siphon product out then something entered the bottle. We have no idea of knowing the cleanliness or sterility. Shame on who ever has done this!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I went from .5 to 1.0 and I see a big difference.  My face is tighter and I have had comments about how youthful my skin looks...I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this retinol has no smell and goes on smooth!</li>
    <li> I love it.Is the best for me</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My dermatologist recommended it but it cost a lot more through her. I started three times a week worked up to five ; I have had many compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> Causes some dryness so use sparingly and follow directions</li>
    <li> I am 41 years old with quite a lot of hormonal discoloration and adult acne; I bought this product to help with the acne and hoped for the best with my other skin maladies. I&#x27;ve been using it for about four months now and it has helped a lot with the acne. After the initial month or so of very red and flaky skin, I I emerged with the smoothest, acne free skin I&#x27;ve had since my pre-pubescent years.  I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles (thanks Mom and Dad), so nothing to report there; I think it&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s helping with the discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some words of advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  If you&#x27;ve never used a retinol product, ramp up. This same maker produces two lower strengths and they actually recommend ramping up. One reviewer mentioned that this product burns the skin; if you&#x27;re not used to it and/or use it more often than directed, you will definitely get that effect. I put too much on my neck in the beginning and was sorry for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Use as directed, the directions are there for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  If you can&#x27;t take the redness and flaking, back off for a few days and then get back to it. It does get better. In the beginning, I could only do twice a week, but after about 45 days, I was up to the recommended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  If you have a good MedSpa in the area, go in for a consultation and see what they think about using a retinol product--it isn&#x27;t for everyone and it&#x27;s good to get advice from an expert before jumping in with both feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Always wear sunscreen. I like Kiel&#x27;s, it&#x27;s light and it doesn&#x27;t burn when you&#x27;re in the red and flaky stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> This is a really good retinol line. I had started with the .5 and then used another brand for a while. I can definitely see a difference after switching to the 1.0. Didn&#x27;t irritate or leave my skin dry. My skin is looking smooth. Have to really avoid the sun while using to make sure you really see the results and don&#x27;t damage your skin.</li>
    <li> A .05 product is often not strong enough-this absorbs quickly also.</li>
    <li> MY FRIEND TOLD ME THIS WOULD WORK ON MY ACNE BLEMISHES... ON MY FACE NOT SO MUCH, BUT IT WORKED ON MY BACK BLEMISHES</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a plastic surgeon that I consulted.  I noticed that the deep lines around my mouth were more shallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well, but won&#x27;t work as well as a face lift.</li>
    <li> I am really seeing a difference in my skin using skin medica products. My skin is smooth and soft. I will keep using this product!</li>
    <li> So far so good!  Not too harsh for my skin... used for 2 weeks now:-)</li>
    <li> I have literally been on a retinol for 30 years!! I remember back when :) I was put on retin-A for acne and remained on that prescription for many, many years which has really helped my acne, particularly when I experienced cystic acne. My acne has since gotten much better but I remain on a retinol for its anti-aging benefits. I find this product to be very good. There are different levels so if you have not used a retinol you may want to step down and use the .25 or .50 and work your way up. I find I have very little redness or irritation with this, which can be a problem for retinoids in general. There are lots of retinol products on the market anymore but I think for the price point and quality of this particular one you simply can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am 46 years old and people tell me everyday that I don&#x27;t have a single wrinkle on my face. I attribute that to long term retinol use.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Skin Medica products. I had recently found out that pure retinol can reduce stretch marks in addition to fine lines. I immediately ordered a bottle and I noticed results right away! (I used it for recent stretch marks on my belly) This is the only product I have found that is 100% retinol. Most other lines are water based and have very little retinol. The key is to start with a low dosage and treat every other day until your skin builds up it&#x27;s tolerance, otherwise it can have an irritating effect. I am planning to buy more once I run out again!</li>
    <li> Plain and simple;this product works !&lt;br /&gt;My sister visited me and I thought she had work done. But it was the Age Defense AND skin brightener used together that she purchased from her dermatologist !&lt;br /&gt;Me ? I purchased mine from Amazon !&lt;br /&gt;And it was less expensive !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be reordering soon !</li>
    <li> Beware - this product from this seller is fake. I have a real one from my dermatologist and compared. The top is different (screws on instead of being sealed shut). It&#x27;s also not as yellow as the real one and slightly thicker. I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s a watered down version of it. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> When i received this product it was leaking from the top where the product comes from, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this on my skin and how quickly it absorbs. I unhy use one pump every 3 days and that&#x27;s all you need. The first two weeks were tough because my skin had to adjust so my skin was dry, flaky and looked terrible. Now my skin glows!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used retinol before, but had to stop while I was pregnant.  I bought this one and I think it might be too high of a concentration.  My skin turned red and purple and burned and peeled.  Just be careful which percentage you buy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you whether this product works or not.  It depends on the condition of your skin, how long you have been using it, whether you are wearing sunscreen, what other products you are using, etc., etc. For me it seems to work ok.  I have no illusions that any product will erase my deep wrinkles but the texture of my skin has improved and a few small wrinkles don&#x27;t seem to be noticeable any more but I cannot really attribute that to this product alone but rather the combination of my skincare products. Instead I thought I will add  my opinion about the way the product arrived and whether it seemed authentic since there is so much discussion about those two items.  My product was purchased through amazon and beauty envy.  The product arrived in a sealed box that is identical to the ones skinmedica sells and it had a flier inside on how to enter skinmedica sweepstakes for a free TNS serum which is a current offer from skinmedica.  I weighed my empty bottle and the new one and the new bottle was 1.1 fl oz which compares well with the amt. stated on the bottle and box.  Just my two cents worth...</li>
    <li> Have been using at the suggestion of dermatologist. Can quickly see results. Suggest to use gradually until skin adjusts.</li>
    <li> I look younger already and I have only used it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Careful, you have to get used to it....can burn your skin if you go overboard... But it works.</li>
    <li> I have used it only a few weeks. In that time I noticed the age spots on my face begining to fade. I use it pm only and every three days. It has a drying effect so I would recomend a good moisturizer .</li>
