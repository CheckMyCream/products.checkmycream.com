### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Its the BEST!!!</li>
      <li>I found it a bit smudgy, but for a smokey eye, its absolutely perfect.</li>
      <li>A great eye liner for a drugstore brand.</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>Awesome and came on time :)</li>
      <li>It Lasts FOREVER as well, which is great (most times).</li>
      <li>I used Maybeline Waterproof Eye Makeup Remover (twice), washed my face with great soap, and it seemed mostly gone.</li>
      <li>I have to say it looks amazing after I put it on...</li>
      <li>The color is amazing-</li>
      <li>eyeliner applies kind of clumpy or spotty.</li>
      <li>I received this product from Influenster/#frostyvoxbox for testing purposes and honest opinion.</li>
      <li>During a warm evening out, the eyeliner kept smudging over the top of my lid and every time I tried to wipe it off, it seemed to make it worse.&lt;br</li>
      <li>easy on the go liner !</li>
      <li>glides on so easily, its like creamy magic!</li>
      <li>This glided on very smoothly without tugging at my skin.  </li>
      <li>I received this free via Influenster to try, review, and supply my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a fantastic product!  </li>
      <li>I love this liner.</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; liner smears and smudges more than non-waterproof ones I have tried .</li>
      <li>I love how this eyeliner goes on</li>
      <li>I also love the choice of colours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so creamy and glides easily onto the water line and eye lid.</li>
      <li>Again, I sharpened it and it was fine, I assume.</li>
      <li>I know this brand is cheap</li>
      <li>The product does a great job of staying put on my upper lid for 12 hours.</li>
      <li>overall it is a good eyeliner</li>
      <li>The eyeliner is good eyeliner - definitely waterproof, doesn&#x27;t smudge, doesn&#x27;t transfer much.</li>
      <li>but it glides on nicely and doesn&#x27;t take several strides to get the look you want!</li>
      <li>I used three different sharpeners and never could get a nice tip.</li>
      <li>I expected more of a pencil texture, but its a lot smoother, and more gel like.</li>
      <li>Incidentally, the Brown pencil is a lovely soft shade tending to bronze.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t want I expected, but due to my own lack of reading lol.</li>
      <li>When I stuck this on my waterline, it disappeared immediately and even after many coats, it barely showed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>&amp; I don&#x27;t want any other liner because this does NOT tug on your skin which is always 100 times better!</li>
      <li>The first time I wore this was for our wedding day &amp; it lasted all day &amp; night</li>
      <li>First of all, mine came without a cap and therefore, with no tip, so I had to sharpen it.</li>
      <li>It stayed so well that certain eye makeup removers didn&#x27;t work well removing it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks, Rimmel.</li>
      <li>And I really wanted it to work for me.  </li>
      <li>It does not irritate my eyes and it stays put reasonably well throughout the day.</li>
      <li>As in, when I draw a straight line across my skin, there will be gaps in the line.</li>
      <li>Being honest, I don&#x27;t know anyone who looks good with the old Cleopatra hard, black eyeliner “wing”.</li>
      <li>Love the pencil but when sharpened it leaves a ruff edge and some sharp places sticking up.</li>
      <li>Too bad because it did go on nice, easy, and smooth.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I had to get another brand pencil eyeliner and apply on top to show the black.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I use eye pencils mostly for this purpose and sparingly around the whole eye in a smoky, smudged way as I find a hard line on me looks dated and heavy-handed.</li>
      <li>The reason I wanted a waterproof eyeliner is because most eyeliners give me raccoon eyes soon after applying, so I usually don&#x27;t use them.  </li>
      <li>This is a true kohl, soft enough to line the waterline of my eyes (i.e., the inner contour).</li>
      <li>I hold eyeliners to a very high standard.  </li>
      <li>Incredible how difficult it is to find a green kohl pencil, let alone a seller who wants to stock it.</li>
      <li>it goes on so smooth in a deep, velvety black.</li>
      <li>I tend to stick with liquid liner, because its hard to find a pencil version that glides on smoothly and stays.  </li>

<li> It wasn&#x27;t nearly as long-lasting as some of the other reviews would have you believe.</li>
<li> What&#x27;s weird is that the actual SMUDGES wouldn&#x27;t budge so easy, so</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s so &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; about this product, but I have never owned an eyeliner that smudged &amp; smeared as much as this one.</li>
<li> It is seriously long lasting.</li>
<li> The product is very difficult to sharpen and it is very easy to break the entire tip off in the sharpener.</li>
<li> Once I did, it was like it was dry.</li>
<li> I don’t know if it because the product is sort of dry or because it’s not pigmented at all.</li>
<li> goes on smooth but the line is larger than I like it hard to make a thin line.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll stick to my little red eyeliner pencils from Maybeline.</li>
<li> and I would have to rub it on several times to get A LITTLE COLOR.</li>
<li> The only problem I have with it is removing it but a little olive oil does the trick.</li>
<li> Ultimately, I pretty disappointed but I did not pay much for it</li>
<li> /&gt;Removal is even harder-</li>
<li> This brand is one of the few that actually offers a green shade.</li>
<li> And this only cost $5.00 or less depending where you go!</li>
<li> pencil glides over the waterline, leaving enough product to make a pretty difference to the expression of my eyes, but does not melt into a greasy mess (which some kohl pencils unfortunately do).</li>
<li> , I will never go to any other eyeliner.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other colors.</li>
<li> it smudged a little  and downfall its hard to get off with facial wipes because its waterproof.</li>
<li> And that is why I had to buy it in Black and Brown instead.</li>
<li> The pigmentation of the eyeliner went on very dark so that I didn&#x27;t feel the need to reapply it to define what I had already done.  </li>
<li> even thought the crying &amp; dancing.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so upset with this waste money for this sigh</li>
<li> I will buy it in Green, now that I know it works as intended, and as soon as I find a daring stockist.</li>
<li> So really its not that bad.</li>
<li> but I never thought it would be so hard to sharpen.</li>
<li> This eyeliner truly SUCKS.  </li>
<li> this shouldn&#x27;t be so hard!</li>
<li> It sucks!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m having to wipe my eyes real hard to get it off, not good.  </li>
<li> This is worse than any of my liquid eyeliners.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not happy with this keep fade away on my line eyes blink or won&#x27;t stay keep</li>
<li> Sad to say, this eyeliner was one of them.  </li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>
<li> And maybe I&#x27;m just an idiot, but I could not for the life of me figure out how to &amp;#34;sharpen&amp;#34;</li>
<li> Very disappointed!!</li>

    <li> This is a true kohl, soft enough to line the waterline of my eyes (i.e., the inner contour). I use eye pencils mostly for this purpose and sparingly around the whole eye in a smoky, smudged way as I find a hard line on me looks dated and heavy-handed. Being honest, I don&#x27;t know anyone who looks good with the old Cleopatra hard, black eyeliner “wing”. It may be the fad of the moment but it isn&#x27;t flattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pencil glides over the waterline, leaving enough product to make a pretty difference to the expression of my eyes, but does not melt into a greasy mess (which some kohl pencils unfortunately do). It does not irritate my eyes and it stays put reasonably well throughout the day. I also love the choice of colours. This brand is one of the few that actually offers a green shade. Incredible how difficult it is to find a green kohl pencil, let alone a seller who wants to stock it. And that is why I had to buy it in Black and Brown instead. Incidentally, the Brown pencil is a lovely soft shade tending to bronze. I will buy it in Green, now that I know it works as intended, and as soon as I find a daring stockist.</li>
    <li> Awesome and came on time :)</li>
    <li> I love how this eyeliner goes on but.....You can&#x27;t sharpen it, it just breaks the tip off every time.</li>
    <li> This glided on very smoothly without tugging at my skin.  The pigmentation of the eyeliner went on very dark so that I didn&#x27;t feel the need to reapply it to define what I had already done.  The color stayed all day and didn&#x27;t smudge, it was like a liquid eyeliner in a stick.  It stayed so well that certain eye makeup removers didn&#x27;t work well removing it.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a fantastic product!  I received this free via Influenster to try, review, and supply my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I use this thing for what&#x27;s its made for. I use it for upper eyeliner &amp; lower eyeliner &amp; this glides on so easily, its like creamy magic! The water proof is a plus. The first time I wore this was for our wedding day &amp; it lasted all day &amp; night even thought the crying &amp; dancing. Love this &amp; I swear by this, I will never go to any other eyeliner. This is definitely my go to &amp; I don&#x27;t want any other liner because this does NOT tug on your skin which is always 100 times better! Plus its affordable. The only problem I have with it is removing it but a little olive oil does the trick. So really its not that bad. Its the BEST!!!</li>
    <li> The product does a great job of staying put on my upper lid for 12 hours. It tends to run a bit on the bottom. The product is very difficult to sharpen and it is very easy to break the entire tip off in the sharpener.</li>
    <li> goes on smooth but the line is larger than I like it hard to make a thin line.  overall it is a good eyeliner</li>
    <li> The reason I wanted a waterproof eyeliner is because most eyeliners give me raccoon eyes soon after applying, so I usually don&#x27;t use them.  So I was advised to get a waterproof one.  This &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; liner smears and smudges more than non-waterproof ones I have tried . Too bad because it did go on nice, easy, and smooth.  But for what ? What&#x27;s weird is that the actual SMUDGES wouldn&#x27;t budge so easy, so I&#x27;m having to wipe my eyes real hard to get it off, not good.  This eyeliner truly SUCKS.  Boooooooo !!!!</li>
    <li> I know this brand is cheap but I never thought it would be so hard to sharpen. Doesn&#x27;t have a built in sharpener. I used three different sharpeners and never could get a nice tip. Love the pencil but when sharpened it leaves a ruff edge and some sharp places sticking up. It can scratch the eye so I won&#x27;t purchase it again just because of this problem.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for the product, 1 star for the way it arrived. 3 stars evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, this eyeliner arrives on a box, with the lid off, eyeliner all over the textbooks I&#x27;d ordered. It just needed to be sharpened, but I am displeased that this product arrived not even sealed! Again, I sharpened it and it was fine, I assume. The eyeliner is good eyeliner - definitely waterproof, doesn&#x27;t smudge, doesn&#x27;t transfer much. I ordered this liner in Nude from a different place and it arrived sealed up. Why wasn&#x27;t this one sealed up? Hmm. Thanks, Rimmel.</li>
    <li> ***I received this product from Influenster/#frostyvoxbox for testing purposes and honest opinion. *** I hold eyeliners to a very high standard.  I tend to stick with liquid liner, because its hard to find a pencil version that glides on smoothly and stays.  Sad to say, this eyeliner was one of them.  And I really wanted it to work for me.  When applying it to my waterline, I had to keep going over and over for the Kajal color to show.  In fact, I had to get another brand pencil eyeliner and apply on top to show the black.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> If there were a  ZERO star rating, I would select it for this product. It sucks! First of all, mine came without a cap and therefore, with no tip, so I had to sharpen it. Once I did, it was like it was dry. It wouldn’t color and I would have to rub it on several times to get A LITTLE COLOR. I don’t know if it because the product is sort of dry or because it’s not pigmented at all. Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I love this liner. It&#x27;s so creamy and glides easily onto the water line and eye lid. It is seriously long lasting. It does not smudge off or even come off. It literally can last morning to night. And it is waterproof. I took a shower and the eyeliner was still on my waterline with no smudges. A great eye liner for a drugstore brand. And this only cost $5.00 or less depending where you go! Highly recommend. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other colors.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t want I expected, but due to my own lack of reading lol. I expected more of a pencil texture, but its a lot smoother, and more gel like. It Lasts FOREVER as well, which is great (most times). I found it a bit smudgy, but for a smokey eye, its absolutely perfect.</li>
    <li> The color is amazing- it goes on so smooth in a deep, velvety black. I have to say it looks amazing after I put it on...but it doesn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s so &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; about this product, but I have never owned an eyeliner that smudged &amp; smeared as much as this one. During a warm evening out, the eyeliner kept smudging over the top of my lid and every time I tried to wipe it off, it seemed to make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal is even harder- I used Maybeline Waterproof Eye Makeup Remover (twice), washed my face with great soap, and it seemed mostly gone. and I still wokeup with smudged eyeliner under my eyes and on my eye lids! It&#x27;s like it mysteriously expands as time goes on. And maybe I&#x27;m just an idiot, but I could not for the life of me figure out how to &amp;#34;sharpen&amp;#34; it. Wouldn&#x27;t work in an eyeliner sharpener, can&#x27;t turn or push the bottom of the pencil to push it out...this shouldn&#x27;t be so hard! Would not buy again and would not recommend. I&#x27;ll stick to my little red eyeliner pencils from Maybeline.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this keep fade away on my line eyes blink or won&#x27;t stay keep fade I&#x27;m so upset with this waste money for this sigh</li>
    <li> It works great it smudged a little  and downfall its hard to get off with facial wipes because its waterproof. but it glides on nicely and doesn&#x27;t take several strides to get the look you want! easy on the go liner !</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t nearly as long-lasting as some of the other reviews would have you believe. I have lids that tend to transfer and the product gave me the raccoon eyes after 10 minutes. This is worse than any of my liquid eyeliners. When I stuck this on my waterline, it disappeared immediately and even after many coats, it barely showed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner applies kind of clumpy or spotty. As in, when I draw a straight line across my skin, there will be gaps in the line. Ultimately, I pretty disappointed but I did not pay much for it so there&#x27;s that.</li>
