### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Absolutely perfect!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase!</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
      <li>While the size was ideal, the price was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think this is great as they don&#x27;t flop around and crash into things.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great design -- they are sturdy and you can see everything in each one of them, plus the stuff in the &amp;#34;bottom&amp;#34; of the case and anything you have stored in the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;back/front&amp;#34; of the case.</li>
      <li>A great organizational box.</li>
      <li>Sold, durable, great for travelling.</li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m pleasantly relieved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good quality though.  </li>
      <li>but I think that is good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited and happy with this purchase!</li>
      <li>This has been done really nicely -- the fabric has nicely finished/stitched edges</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Case is well constructed and the all the parts are assembled nicely.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a case, this seems like the best one out there, particularly at this price point.</li>
      <li>it is very high quality, uses the space wisely, and looks great.</li>
      <li>-- it&#x27;s brilliant and done really tastefully!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I know I will be using this case for many years to come.  </li>
      <li>and I went for red :D ).</li>
      <li>more so we needed a place to keep all the makeup organized and stored safely in between use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it was well packaged and arrive safely at my house without any dings or gouges.</li>
      <li>But the thing that upset me most is the detachable shoulder strap which is from plastic</li>
      <li>The fabric itself seems to be mostly synthetic</li>
      <li>but I have no idea how you&#x27;d make this product any better.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s built so well than be able to use one hand to close a poorly-made product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The buckles on the top and the hinges and some of the pieces that hold the case together also seem to be metal (steel?).</li>
      <li>sister -- who wears a lot more makeup than I do and has had a train case for years -- warned me of a couple of things.</li>
      <li>Love this case - it seems sturdy and fits all of my products with ease.</li>
      <li>As a pro makeup artist, I always have to carry many products each time I work...</li>
      <li>This is a great quality makeup case, and in a beautiful bold shade of red.</li>
      <li>Each &amp;#34;shelf&amp;#34; has a piece of clear plastic that has been sewn in very nicely.</li>
      <li>so I think any spills could be easily cleaned up.</li>
      <li>something I could easily recognize.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m predicting that it will be durable and easy to clean most products off of it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I fit all my make up in here (</li>
      <li>this one, based on the dimensions given, sounded like it would fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have two layers of shadows on some of the trays, which should give a pretty good idea of how much it holds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with this part even though it has very little to do with the performance of the case.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s original box  </li>
      <li>The fear was that there&#x27;d be space in the &amp;#34;back&amp;#34; of the shelves that wouldn&#x27;t be accessible.</li>
      <li>I assume this is to help keep the case clean</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, the seller shipped quickly and the case was shipped surrounded by bubble wrap in</li>
      <li>Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>it has just the right size to be able to carry it without much effort but at the same time being able to take with me anything I may need!</li>
      <li>Very practical, easy to carry, as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>fully opened, the case balances fine and is really sturdy.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price-buy one</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The bottom of the case is also covered in the fabric really nicely and serves as a place to store larger items.</li>
      <li>I love this arrangement because (almost) all of my brushes are sticking straight up, ready for me to use and it also uses part of the case that would otherwise go unused.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the right size for you</li>
      <li>Frankly, for my lifestyle, one train case full of cosmetics is more than enough.</li>
      <li>The red color in the photograph is fairly true to the actual color - very nice.</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;tshown my sister this case, but I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll approve when she sees it (except maybe the color since she&#x27;s more of a black or metal girl</li>
      <li>I have never worn very much makeup</li>
      <li>At first, I had all of my brushes on one side.</li>
      <li>I ordered the red one and it is so stylish.  </li>
      <li>I thought the price is appropriate to the quality, especially after I saw below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anyways, I&#x27;m happy to report that when the &amp;#34;shelves&amp;#34; are fully extended, they only overlap each other by about an inch.</li>
      <li>and it broke on one side from the first time that i attached it to the case, plus is not providing a good grip, the case is not steady when on your shoulder, so I will just have to carry mine using the handle only.</li>
      <li>Sturdy and large.</li>
      <li>This, to me, is a sign of the great quality of this case; everything is tight and built to last.</li>
      <li>Anyways, I was looking for a train case like this one that wasn&#x27;t huge but also wasn&#x27;t tiny and</li>
      <li>34;how fast it will fill up&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say I&#x27;d much rather have to use both hands to close itbecause</li>
      <li>They appear to be metal too and are very sturdy.</li>
      <li>I really like this case</li>
      <li>It is very roomy and it does, indeed, give room for your brushes in the lid.  </li>
      <li>(my counter is very slippery though, so it could be a product of my situation).</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and durable, also has a lock that can be used if you need to.</li>
      <li>First, she said, that I&#x27;d be surprised &amp;#</li>
      <li>The shelves open to the &amp;#34;sides&amp;#34; in the opposite direction of the top and bottom.</li>
      <li>The trays move very smoothly and look like they&#x27;ll last a long time.  </li>
      <li>(for example, I have a few bobby pins on the top &amp;#34;shelf&amp;#34; but the rest of the &amp;#34;pack&amp;#34; of bobby pins is kept in the bottom of</li>
      <li>so we opted for the pink and black which is super cute.</li>
      <li>The handle is securely attached -- overall the case has a solid feel.</li>
      <li>The case is big enough and can fit lots of items but the outer corners and handle are from plastic.</li>
      <li>This thing is pretty massive.</li>
      <li>I have it in red, and it looks pretty on my counter.</li>
      <li>The black &amp;#34;edges&amp;#34; are totally smooth and also matte.</li>
      <li>many times, at my client&#x27;s houses or when working for photo shoots there&#x27;s not a suitable space where I can organize all my products...</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have a big amount of make up, butmore than what I can comfortably hold in a single make up bag.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>When the case is open, they stick way up past the case but it works just fine to close the case this side first</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t realized it had the elastic bands on one side to put your make up brushes, and when you open it, they end up located upright, ready to pick the one you need.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>I would imagine once filled that is would be heavy to lug around.</li>
      <li>, when you open it, you&#x27;ll see each side has a piece of elastic sewn near the opening (the top of the case when it&#x27;s closed) such that there are 6 &amp;#34;tabs&amp;#34; on each side.</li>
      <li>It carries enough makeup and skin care products without taking up much space.</li>
      <li>When I first opened the shelves, I was amazed -- they actually take some effort to open!</li>
      <li>The handle has a slightly cushioned black rubber-feeling part so when you carry the case, it&#x27;s more comfortable and your hand will be less likely to slip around.</li>
      <li>The materials are not cheap at all -- in fact, the case is much heavier than I thought it&#x27;d be -- and it is all really well put together.</li>
      <li>The hinges appear to be above average and the two locking clasps on top keep it securely closed even if not using the lock.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain but feel free to ask questions.</li>
      <li>I did pick up at Target a smaller SOHO case for about $30 and the quality was close to this one but not nearly as heavy.</li>
      <li>When you open the case up, it&#x27;s cut basically in half (front and back) and the two pieces hinge and open to reveal the &amp;#34;shelves&amp;#34; folded up on top of and beside each other.</li>
      <li>I was very hesitant to buy this because it&#x27;s the most expensive single makeup purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
      <li>The lock and key does work, which I am so excited about because I do makeup for children&#x27;s theatre and those little hands can get curious and grabby.  </li>
      <li>Some other reviews have commented that these are kind of useless unless your brushes are only a few inches tall, but I&#x27;ve found them to be useful.</li>
      <li>I still only use makeup very sparingly but I have a bunch of those little &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34; of mineral eye shadow.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This thing is pretty massive. I have a really big makeup collection and this held it all! Thinking of getting another for my nail polishes!</li>
    <li> My 10yo daughter is starting to perform in dance shows and competitions more so we needed a place to keep all the makeup organized and stored safely in between use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Case is well constructed and the all the parts are assembled nicely. The hinges appear to be above average and the two locking clasps on top keep it securely closed even if not using the lock. The pull up/out drawers have a plastic liner on the inside bottom so I think any spills could be easily cleaned up. Drawers need a slight effort to open up but I think that is good so it doesn&#x27;t close accidently while accessing the bottom of the case. The handle is securely attached -- overall the case has a solid feel. Has 4 rubber feet on the bottom and both lids has elastic band to hold brushes or pencils. Also included is a shoulder strap that can be attached. The red appeared reddish orange online so we opted for the pink and black which is super cute. The black parts are a hard plastic and the colored parts appear to be masonite board (hence the weight and strength) and the silver parts are metal. I thought the price is appropriate to the quality, especially after I saw below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The case is heavy even when empty. Although not a problem for an adult, it is not ideal for a child. I would imagine once filled that is would be heavy to lug around. If you are not planning to take it places, it&#x27;s weight is actually a benefit so not easily knocked over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked out the Caboodles train cases at Target and all the ones I saw were already broken or the construction was poor (one wouldn&#x27;t even latch close for no apparent cause). I did pick up at Target a smaller SOHO case for about $30 and the quality was close to this one but not nearly as heavy. I think we will use the SOHO case for travel and keep this case for at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand did make a smaller case but was priced at about $90 because it could latch onto it&#x27;s other larger makeup cases. While the size was ideal, the price was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the seller shipped quickly and the case was shipped surrounded by bubble wrap in it&#x27;s original box  and then inside another solid shipping box so it was well packaged and arrive safely at my house without any dings or gouges.</li>
    <li> I fit all my make up in here (which is alot) it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Very practical, easy to carry, as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a big amount of make up, butmore than what I can comfortably hold in a single make up bag.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realized it had the elastic bands on one side to put your make up brushes, and when you open it, they end up located upright, ready to pick the one you need.&lt;br /&gt;Good construction. I have two layers of shadows on some of the trays, which should give a pretty good idea of how much it holds.&lt;br /&gt;I can put mascaras, liners, and other long items on each tray.</li>
    <li> I have never worn very much makeup but a few months ago, I invested in some brushes and mineral make up. I still only use makeup very sparingly but I have a bunch of those little &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34; of mineral eye shadow. The disarray was getting annoying and I hated that every morning, I had to grab three different bags to get ready. Anyways, I was looking for a train case like this one that wasn&#x27;t huge but also wasn&#x27;t tiny and this one, based on the dimensions given, sounded like it would fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister -- who wears a lot more makeup than I do and has had a train case for years -- warned me of a couple of things. First, she said, that I&#x27;d be surprised &amp;#34;how fast it will fill up&amp;#34;. I knew I would fill this up with even my limited collection, but I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d mind that. Yes, if I want to buy a lot more products or tools, I&#x27;m going to have to get rid of some that I already have... is that a bad thing? Frankly, for my lifestyle, one train case full of cosmetics is more than enough. I realize that people have different lifestyles (like my sister) so this case might be a little small. But it&#x27;s perfect for me. And if you have a lot of makeup and tools, maybe you could get two of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, my sister also said that I might not like how the &amp;#34;shelves&amp;#34; come out and overlap each other. The fear was that there&#x27;d be space in the &amp;#34;back&amp;#34; of the shelves that wouldn&#x27;t be accessible. I read the reviews and couldn&#x27;t find anything about this. I also looked around for a differently-designed case but it seems like this is a pretty common arrangement. My sister&#x27;s case has one &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; of shelves that goes up and out the back of the case so they&#x27;re bigger but it&#x27;s the same amount of storage space. Anyways, I&#x27;m happy to report that when the &amp;#34;shelves&amp;#34; are fully extended, they only overlap each other by about an inch. Nothing gets stuck in that space or is made inaccessible so I&#x27;m pleasantly relieved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;tshown my sister this case, but I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll approve when she sees it (except maybe the color since she&#x27;s more of a black or metal girl and I went for red :D ). If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this case and you&#x27;re bored with reading this review, I&#x27;ll sum it all up quickly now: it is very high quality, uses the space wisely, and looks great. The materials are not cheap at all -- in fact, the case is much heavier than I thought it&#x27;d be -- and it is all really well put together. Another review said it looks/feels just like a MAC case but for half the price. I don&#x27;t know about that because I&#x27;ve never seen a MAC case but I have no idea how you&#x27;d make this product any better. In short, if you need a case like this and it&#x27;s the right size for you, I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you&#x27;re like me, and you like long, boring details, here are some for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the outside. Keep in mind, I got the red one so other colors may be different. But here goes. The colored panels of the case are &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; but with a really slight texture. The black &amp;#34;edges&amp;#34; are totally smooth and also matte. The buckles on the top and the hinges and some of the pieces that hold the case together also seem to be metal (steel?). They are all shiny. The corner pieces also look like shiny metal/chrome but I&#x27;m not sure they aren&#x27;t plastic. The handle has a slightly cushioned black rubber-feeling part so when you carry the case, it&#x27;s more comfortable and your hand will be less likely to slip around. There are two small knobs that poke out of the sides for connection of the strap. They appear to be metal too and are very sturdy. I&#x27;m not using the strap so they are sort of pointless but they&#x27;re there if I need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the inside. When you open the case up, it&#x27;s cut basically in half (front and back) and the two pieces hinge and open to reveal the &amp;#34;shelves&amp;#34; folded up on top of and beside each other. The photo that was with the product shows them opening all the way (past 90 degrees) to sit/rest on the surface with the case but mine only open 90 degrees and then stop themselves. I think this is great as they don&#x27;t flop around and crash into things. It definitely gives the case some stability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire inside of the case is covered in a black fabric with the company logo &amp;#34;ghosted&amp;#34; on the fabric. This has been done really nicely -- the fabric has nicely finished/stitched edges and although it might be glued in, it seems like it was done well and won&#x27;t peel up or come off any time soon. I&#x27;m really impressed with this part even though it has very little to do with the performance of the case. The fabric itself seems to be mostly synthetic so I&#x27;m predicting that it will be durable and easy to clean most products off of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In both the &amp;#34;front&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;back&amp;#34; of the case, when you open it, you&#x27;ll see each side has a piece of elastic sewn near the opening (the top of the case when it&#x27;s closed) such that there are 6 &amp;#34;tabs&amp;#34; on each side. Some other reviews have commented that these are kind of useless unless your brushes are only a few inches tall, but I&#x27;ve found them to be useful. The side with the larger part of the buckle on it seems to be sewn &amp;#34;looser&amp;#34; for larger brush handles or bottle and the other side is sewn tighter. At first, I had all of my brushes on one side. When the case is open, they stick way up past the case but it works just fine to close the case this side first and then the other side, opening it in the opposite manner. The only problem is that you can only use one &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; of these tabs because when the case is closed, they overlap each other. It&#x27;s hard to explain but feel free to ask questions. I had to make an adjustment to my system because my larger blush and foundation brushes were getting smushed somehow and their bristles were being mis-shaped. I just put those 3 brushes in a shelf and left all of my other brushes inthe tabs. I love this arrangement because (almost) all of my brushes are sticking straight up, ready for me to use and it also uses part of the case that would otherwise go unused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shelves. When I first opened the shelves, I was amazed -- they actually take some effort to open! This, to me, is a sign of the great quality of this case; everything is tight and built to last. The shelves open to the &amp;#34;sides&amp;#34; in the opposite direction of the top and bottom. They are connected with flat pieces of silver metal (probably aluminum) that are riveted on. It&#x27;s a great design -- they are sturdy and you can see everything in each one of them, plus the stuff in the &amp;#34;bottom&amp;#34; of the case and anything you have stored in the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;back/front&amp;#34; of the case. I think each shelf is made out of plastic but they are all covered in the fabric to match the rest of the case&#x27;s inside. Each &amp;#34;shelf&amp;#34; has a piece of clear plastic that has been sewn in very nicely. I assume this is to help keep the case clean -- it&#x27;s brilliant and done really tastefully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom of the case is also covered in the fabric really nicely and serves as a place to store larger items. It&#x27;s the size of the case&#x27;s footprint an is about twice as tall as one of the &amp;#34;shelves&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve put a bunch of hair things in there as well as things I don&#x27;t use regularly like fake eyelashes and extra items that I have more of elsewhere in the case (for example, I have a few bobby pins on the top &amp;#34;shelf&amp;#34; but the rest of the &amp;#34;pack&amp;#34; of bobby pins is kept in the bottom of the case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fully opened, the case balances fine and is really sturdy. I use both hands to close the shelves because although it has four little feet on its bottom, the case will slide around if I just try to close it up with one hand (my counter is very slippery though, so it could be a product of my situation). I&#x27;d say I&#x27;d much rather have to use both hands to close itbecause it&#x27;s built so well than be able to use one hand to close a poorly-made product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s about it for my review. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. I was very hesitant to buy this because it&#x27;s the most expensive single makeup purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. But I did the research and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my decision. If you&#x27;re looking for a case, this seems like the best one out there, particularly at this price point. FIVE STARS!!!</li>
    <li> Love this case - it seems sturdy and fits all of my products with ease. It did have a bit of a chemical smell when it arrived, but a couple of days of airing out took care of the issue. The red color in the photograph is fairly true to the actual color - very nice. I&#x27;d recommend this case!</li>
    <li> This is a great quality makeup case, and in a beautiful bold shade of red. I would recomend this case to anyone</li>
    <li> Sold, durable, great for travelling. Although a little pricy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase! it has just the right size to be able to carry it without much effort but at the same time being able to take with me anything I may need! As a pro makeup artist, I always have to carry many products each time I work... many times, at my client&#x27;s houses or when working for photo shoots there&#x27;s not a suitable space where I can organize all my products... with this case that&#x27;s not a problem for me anymore! I have everything I need, organized in a way it saves me time and money!</li>
    <li> I am giving 3 stars to this product as I am not completely satisfied with the scale price/quality.The case is big enough and can fit lots of items but the outer corners and handle are from plastic.I imagined that if the box is from aluminum then the rest should be the same.The key provided for the lock is useless because even if I lock it it still can be opened by forcing a bit the locking latches. But the thing that upset me most is the detachable shoulder strap which is from plastic and it broke on one side from the first time that i attached it to the case, plus is not providing a good grip, the case is not steady when on your shoulder, so I will just have to carry mine using the handle only.</li>
    <li> A little too small, but well constructed.  I purchased it as a Christmas gift. I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> It carries enough makeup and skin care products without taking up much space. I have it in red, and it looks pretty on my counter.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect!!  This case holds everything and keeps me organized.  How did I survive before I got this???  I love it!!</li>
    <li> A great organizational box. I only wish the bottom compartment was a little deeper. There are several sections that fold out to help you get organized!</li>
    <li> This is bigger than I expected, pretty heavy even empty!  Good quality though.  Sturdy.  Hopefully will stand up to my teenage daughter&#x27;s abuse.</li>
    <li> This case is made so well.  It is very roomy and it does, indeed, give room for your brushes in the lid.  The lock and key does work, which I am so excited about because I do makeup for children&#x27;s theatre and those little hands can get curious and grabby.  The trays move very smoothly and look like they&#x27;ll last a long time.  I&#x27;m so excited and happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I really like this case, I use it to hold all my makeup so when I travel all I have to do it pick it up and go. Holds everything, lots of trays and has 10 elastic side holders for skinny tube pieces like cconcealers, lip gloss, mascaras, etc. I got it in the red instead of the standard silver or black b/c I wanted it to stand out, something I could easily recognize. Very sturdy and durable, also has a lock that can be used if you need to.</li>
    <li> This makeup case is so well made.  It has plenty of space to organize all your beauty goodies!  I ordered the red one and it is so stylish.  I know I will be using this case for many years to come.  Well worth the price-buy one you will NOT regret it!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and large. Seems to be well made and like ti will hold up for some time. Not too heavy. Wish a mirror could have been incorporated somehow. Worth the price. Only been in use for a few weeks, if it fails I will add to this review!</li>
