      <li>She told me to try it, but I&#x27;ve been so used to my boar bristle brush that really yanks on my hair and thought that was the only way to get my hair straight, smooth and styled.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
      <li>It is so much easier to use because it holds and slides through my hair.</li>
      <li>the picture looks a lot better and you can confuse it with the same brand hair bush that has combined brissels (natural and plastic).</li>
      <li>I own many other branded round brushes, and this has never happened!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>; long bristles) brush that leaves my wavy, mid-length hair smooth, shiny &amp; bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
      <li>The 3.5 inch barrel leaves my below shoulder length fairly straight, as in without a flip at the bottom, so I have been able to cut down on flat iron use.</li>
      <li>Handle was soft, ,but hair still tangles between handle and brush.</li>
      <li>I bought this brush for my husband,he is professional hairdresser.</li>

      <li>cuts drying time in half &amp; I have VERY curly hair!</li>
      <li>This brush overall is wonderful, the only thing i have to say about it, is that while you are turning the brush (like you would to straighten your hair with a round brush)the hair gets cought in the handle, and it hurts :(</li>

    <li> I have very curly, fine, thin, hair. I started using a brush from the drug store about 6 years ago that is similar to this in design. I loved that brush. Beautiful, quick, smooth blow outs. This brush somehow is so much better and smoother. My hairdresser uses the same brand so I decided to try it and I&amp;#34;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the soft comfortable handle. The 3.5 inch barrel leaves my below shoulder length fairly straight, as in without a flip at the bottom, so I have been able to cut down on flat iron use.</li>
    <li> cheap quality, it seems made out of a soup can. the picture looks a lot better and you can confuse it with the same brand hair bush that has combined brissels (natural and plastic). Sadly, I couldn&#x27;t return it because they did not send me paid return label, so if you decide to buy it don&#x27;t go with this link.</li>
    <li> I am very picky with my brushes for blowdrying my hair, but I LOVE this one...cuts drying time in half &amp; I have VERY curly hair! One con - which goes for almost all of these brushes - is that my hair gets caught in the part where the handle meets the brush, but I resolve that by putting a scrunchie in that area. I use this 3.5&amp;#34; for my long layers and purchased the 3&amp;#34; for the shorter framing layers.</li>
    <li> Huge brush and hair gets caught don&#x27;t know how to use this thing because my hair kept getting stuck and I was trying to be very carefull to not damage my hair breaking it :(</li>
    <li> Great brush line...ceramic and tourmaline so hair dries quickly and in healthy, shiny condition. I have very naturally curly hair and this brush line dries it beautifully and never tangles. Comes out straight and smooth without much work at all. I highly recommend the Prego Spornette brush line!!!</li>
    <li> Had this brush for almost 10 years, when it got ruined in my luggage I was so upset and had to find a replacement! So glad to find it again here! Love this brush!</li>
    <li> The handle detaches from the head very easily and often.  I have to be careful when drying my hair so it doesn&#x27;t come off.</li>
    <li> It is big but so light, the handle is soft and good price, I like the color too&lt;br /&gt;i really suggest this product</li>
    <li> This is quite a large brush. It&#x27;s good for creating volume, but not so good for smoothing out hair since it&#x27;s hard to maneuver. But the biggest problem is that when you roll your hair around the brush, some hairs get caught up in the gap between the barrel and the handle and it rips the hair when you keep turning. Yikes! That really should not happen with a brush that&#x27;s this expensive.</li>
    <li> Creates lots of volume with your hair!</li>
    <li> Great brush! You don&#x27;t need to be a hairdresser to get great results, it give you the grip you need to style your hair when blowdrying it.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my husband,he is professional hairdresser. He needed it for work. He liked it. Delivery was very fast.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and this is great for when I straighten it. It is smoother and dries faster!</li>
    <li> This brush overall is wonderful, the only thing i have to say about it, is that while you are turning the brush (like you would to straighten your hair with a round brush)the hair gets cought in the handle, and it hurts :( I own many other branded round brushes, and this has never happened!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall it&#x27;s light weight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Handle broke after a few months.  Not happy.  it worked okay while i had it.  Not my favorite brush.  Handle was soft, ,but hair still tangles between handle and brush.</li>
    <li> Spornette is my favorite brush brand. I usually have gone with the drug store &amp;#34;Goody&amp;#34; brand for a round brush but having another one break on me I decided to look into a different option. This brush is AWESOME the hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled where the cheaper brushes have grooves. Its bristles dont get pushed in. It has seemed to cut my drying time down.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical after seeing some reviewers said their hair got stuck in it, but I haven&#x27;t had that issue.  I think this is a really great quality brush and would recommend it!  I have shoulder length hair and I just make sure not to try and take too much hair in the brush while I&#x27;m blow drying.  One section at a time and it works great.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or anything...it does get really hot though so be careful not to burn yourself!</li>
    <li> This brush tops all the other brushes. It is so much easier to use because it holds and slides through my hair. Great for thick hair.</li>
    <li> I had used a similar brush at my sister&#x27;s home and fell in love with it! This size is perfect for my long hair and helps me blow dry my hair quick and easy. Doesn&#x27;t tangle hair at all!</li>
    <li> Really does a great job straightening my wavy, shoulder length hair.  Leaves it smooth and shiny, highly recommended.  Soft grip is nice as well.</li>
    <li> This brush was recommended to my Mom by her stylist.  She bought hers from the salon.  She told me to try it, but I&#x27;ve been so used to my boar bristle brush that really yanks on my hair and thought that was the only way to get my hair straight, smooth and styled.  I finally tried it and was so surprised.  I have really fine hair and this brush adds so much movement to my hair.  When sectioned, you can really get body in your style without pulling, yanking or wearing out your wrist!  The large barrel makes it easy...you don&#x27;t have to rotate the brush as much.</li>
    <li> Finally a really big (2-1/2&amp;#34; dia barrel with 1/2&amp;#34; long bristles) brush that leaves my wavy, mid-length hair smooth, shiny &amp; bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;Plus my hair dries faster.  So much better than messing with a curling or flat iron!</li>
    <li> This is the kind of brush my hairstylists uses.  Lightweight and easy to use.  Hair dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Works great to quickly dry hair</li>
    <li> This brush is FABULOUS!  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  My hair is curly and I like to dry it straight.  This brush cut drying time by 10 minutes and my hair never looked better -- I quit using the flat iron.  Other reviews said hair can get tangled in the handle, but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.  I highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> And its HUGE! Great volume and does not tangle in my hair. Seems really rough to the touch at first but does not hurt head and flexes when you need them to. Great brush!</li>
    <li> It is a nice brush that seems to be made well. My only complaint is that it is wider than I thought it would be - but that is my fault. I would recommend a bit smaller size - perhaps 2.5  inches.</li>
    <li> This brush is big and well made. I haven&#x27;t had an issue with the top getting hot, but the coating does as it is supposed to and it makes it very easy to quickly dry and straighten (or curl) my hair. Wish I&#x27;d found this years ago.</li>
    <li> Excellent price. Love the quality of the brush. I do a great job blow drying my hair for a straight look!</li>
