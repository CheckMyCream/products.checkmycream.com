      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this anywhere else for some reason, it&#x27;s my favorite scent, I&#x27;ve used it for many years.  </li>
      <li>perfe desodorante y locion, asi que tienen 20 puntos : )</li>
      <li>I love this scent and you cannot beat the price.</li>
      <li>I love this one just as well...</li>
      <li>Excellent product, very high quality, really recommend it, product purchased and imported into Venezuela</li>
      <li>This parfum has a nice not strong smell every one of my friends like and a good price !!!!!</li>
      <li>Very cheap perfume, not the original fragrance it claims to be and the scent goes away after a minute.</li>
      <li>I have tried it in stores and it is too strong for me.</li>
      <li>Was looking more of a sweet scent, like honeysuckles.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My wife enjoy it (and me).</li>
      <li>If you want the best for less!</li>
      <li>Love this perfume it is one of my favorites, also could not beat this great price for such a large bottle.  </li>
      <li>I meant to order the original Oscar De La renta perfume.  </li>
      <li>I got a whiff of Oscar about 30 yrars ago and it will always be the perfume that I buy for special people.</li>
      <li>If you are a true lover of this fragrance,this item is not for you.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased several of these at a good price and each one has  smelled cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have bought this scent for years but like any other great perfume it depends on who is wearing it</li>
      <li>If you are looking for the original Oscar scent, just be aware that Esprit D&#x27;Oscar is a reformulation and NOT the original.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with my purchase and considering the size, it will last a while! :)</li>
      <li>Highly recommended. :)</li>
      <li>I love researching and trying new perfumes.</li>
      <li>This is such a nice fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to alternate between the two fragrances.</li>
      <li>It was just right for me.  </li>
      <li>Amazon had them for half the price of the best price I could find locally.  </li>
      <li>This perfume is strong but fades quickly into a mild romantic smelling perfume on any woman.</li>
      <li>A bit strong on the takeoff, but it settles down into the most scrumptious, comforting, lady-like scent imaginable.  </li>
      <li>I have used this fragrance since it first hit the market in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>My favorite , and the only place to buy it.</li>
      <li>Not too youngish and not too old ladyish.  </li>
      <li>The first time I ordered it, I did so by mistake and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn&#x27;t the original scent.  </li>
      <li>I was a bit hesitant to try this version as Espirit is slightly different than the original Oscar fragrance I wore in the 80&#x27;s, but wowza!</li>
      <li>The old saying &amp;#34;You Get What You Pay For&amp;#34; holds true to this product.</li>
      <li>what can I say, my wife says she loves it, and its the real thing, and she will never buy it from another department store.</li>
      <li>This perfume is a light, romantic smell.  </li>
      <li>thanks amazon  Pitbullman</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent first of all, its not to heavy</li>
      <li>, I was very surprised!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I bought it for her last Christmas and can say it is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Well worth it based on her reaction and the price comparison with local outlets.</li>
      <li>This is my wife&#x27;s normal perfume</li>
      <li>too strong ..... would have sent it back but threw the inner box away by mistake...</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t smell the same as the first that I have.</li>
      <li>Not too much, but just enough.  </li>
      <li>it may have been old.  </li>
      <li>but even old would have had a scent.  </li>
      <li>was pleasantly surprised to find it at Amazon</li>
      <li>Aroma a little sweet for my taste</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a different from the old Oscar.  </li>
      <li>Selfishly, I want it to be my own.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s got the subtle sweetness of the original but with a musky undertone.  </li>

<li> I usually get her the regular Oscar and thought this was the same stuff, but in a different shaped bottle.  </li>
<li> So, I had a hard time finding a new scent for me...</li>
<li> A little ethereal, but definitely there.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not, and it is a little stronger than the regular.  </li>
<li> so not much is needed to spray on.</li>
<li> now that fall is here, it sits front and center on my dressing table.</li>
<li> a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> It has an oily but slight powdery scent.</li>
<li> and I fully expected this to be a small bottle for what I paid, but when I got it in the mail</li>
<li> I have had trouble finding Oscar De La Renta in parfum for the past few years.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little hard to tell from looking at the box or bottle, but this does say Esprit D&#x27;Oscar, underneath the Oscar</li>
<li> It is delicate but lasts all day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this fragrance is kinda woody&lt;br /&gt;at the beginig smells not so good</li>
    <li> This is such a nice fragrance.  I even put it on in the morning when I am going to be alone all day.  It is not overpowering and besides smelling like expensive perfume (which it is elsewhere) has a very clean scent.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my girlfriend because I like the smell when she wears it. Have a good day tomorrow</li>
    <li> Love it!  The first time I ordered it, I did so by mistake and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn&#x27;t the original scent.  Both fragrances are good, but this is a bit stronger than Oscar.  It stays longer as well.  It&#x27;s nice to alternate between the two fragrances.</li>
    <li> Excellent Price great service. My favorite , and the only place to buy it. If you want the best for less!</li>
    <li> I love researching and trying new perfumes. I came across this one at my local Macy&#x27;s store. I absolutely loved it. It is delicate but lasts all day. It picks up my spirits. at the time of the writing, the offering on amazon.com is a great value. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> These fragance is exelent. My wife enjoy it (and me). In the office and in the laundry, several people ask my wife for the name.</li>
    <li> I got a whiff of Oscar about 30 yrars ago and it will always be the perfume that I buy for special people.</li>
    <li> I have bought this scent for years but like any other great perfume it depends on who is wearing it</li>
    <li> what can I say, my wife says she loves it, and its the real thing, and she will never buy it from another department store. Cause of the price. To sum it up, Shes happy so im happy!! thanks amazon  Pitbullman</li>
    <li> Did not care for it at all!!! too strong ..... would have sent it back but threw the inner box away by mistake...</li>
    <li> Aroma a little sweet for my taste</li>
    <li> This is a very nice mild perfume  am in looooooooooooove with it even my husband loves the scent since I smell it on my sister in law</li>
    <li> This parfum has a nice not strong smell every one of my friends like and a good price !!!!! And the bottle cap is beautifull</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an Oscar De La Renta user for over 20 years.  I love this one just as well...it&#x27;s got the subtle sweetness of the original but with a musky undertone.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I meant to order the original Oscar De La renta perfume.  I tried to return this one unopened but I was told I couldn&#x27;t return it so I am stuck with a perfume I don&#x27;t want.  I have tried it in stores and it is too strong for me.</li>
    <li> OO LA LA!!! This perfume is strong but fades quickly into a mild romantic smelling perfume on any woman. My wife smells great with it. I bought it for her last Christmas and can say it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Yes I would recommend this perfume to all. I love this scent and you cannot beat the price. Thank You!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Item perfect, as described.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Just as described, excellent product. arrived on time</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance since it first hit the market in the 80&#x27;s.  Still is the best ever.  The price at amazon can not be beat.</li>
    <li> Very nice I love it &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> No me gusto la fragancia</li>
    <li> When I was younger I could wear \\&quot;spicier\\&quot; fragrances.  Not any more.  So, I had a hard time finding a new scent for me...something that wasn&#x27;t too too.  Not too youngish and not too old ladyish.  Then Esprit came along.  It was just right for me.  A little ethereal, but definitely there.  I almost hesitate to review this scent because I don&#x27;t want a lot of people wearing it.  Selfishly, I want it to be my own.  So don&#x27;t start going out and buying it!</li>
    <li> I opened the package of esprit de.oscar and no smell at all.  I have purchased several of these at a good price and each one has  smelled cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t  buy again.  its like they pour colored water into bottle. it may have been old.  but even old would have had a scent.  this had no scent at all.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife as a Christmas gift. This is my wife&#x27;s normal perfume so we know what it smells like. This is a cheap knock-off at best of the original Oscar De La Renta. Once you buy it you are stuck with it because they will not let you return it. The old saying &amp;#34;You Get What You Pay For&amp;#34; holds true to this product.</li>
    <li> Realmente muy contenta cn mi compra, tenia años buscando esta fragancia y la consegui en perfe desodorante y locion, asi que tienen 20 puntos : )</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife.  I usually get her the regular Oscar and thought this was the same stuff, but in a different shaped bottle.  It&#x27;s not, and it is a little stronger than the regular.  However, she stills likes it.  Next time, I&#x27;ll get the regular Oscar.</li>
    <li> If you are a true lover of this fragrance,this item is not for you.  It is an alcohol spray.  Don&#x27;t Buy!</li>
    <li> I have had trouble finding Oscar De La Renta in parfum for the past few years.  I have been wearing it for over 30 years!&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find it at Amazon and I am happy with the product I got for a great price!</li>
    <li> still getting compliments on this sent after all these years.... ...... ..... ........ ... ..... ... ..... .. .... .</li>
    <li> I was very impressed !! I would definitely order again. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;!!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t arrive with the pictured box, just the bottle. In fact on the bottom back of the bottle was a label that read &amp;#34;tester.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell the same as the first that I have. I will neve purchase a perfume again using this site</li>
    <li> I must admit, I&#x27;m not the greatest with ounce sizes and I fully expected this to be a small bottle for what I paid, but when I got it in the mail and it&#x27;s 5 inches tall, I was very surprised!  This perfume is a light, romantic smell.  Not too much, but just enough.  I am pleased with my purchase and considering the size, it will last a while! :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very high quality, really recommend it, product purchased and imported into Venezuela</li>
    <li> If you are looking for the original Oscar scent, just be aware that Esprit D&#x27;Oscar is a reformulation and NOT the original.  I bought this one by accident.  It is still a very nice perfume, but just know that it&#x27;s not the original.  In some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read, people have stated that it&#x27;s a knock-off product, which it is not.  It&#x27;s just a different from the old Oscar.  It&#x27;s a little hard to tell from looking at the box or bottle, but this does say Esprit D&#x27;Oscar, underneath the Oscar logo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have both of them!  (Still like the old one best - but this one is good, too.)</li>
    <li> My father purchased this item for my mother.  Its her favorite fragrance and she was very pleased with the gift.</li>
    <li> Yes, I would recommend this to others. It has an oily but slight powdery scent. It&#x27;s not the scent I was looking for, but I bought it, now I have to use it up. Was looking more of a sweet scent, like honeysuckles.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves it. so what more is needed? lol. 5 stars for making her happy! a little goes a long way. so not much is needed to spray on.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to try this version as Espirit is slightly different than the original Oscar fragrance I wore in the 80&#x27;s, but wowza! A bit strong on the takeoff, but it settles down into the most scrumptious, comforting, lady-like scent imaginable.  Strictly a cool/cold weather fragrance for me and now that fall is here, it sits front and center on my dressing table.</li>
    <li> I love the scent first of all, its not to heavy you can use it in the winter or spring,and the smell last all day/evening.  I&#x27;ve used Oscar De La Renta for years.  The bottle size was great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume it is one of my favorites, also could not beat this great price for such a large bottle.  Highly recommended. :)</li>
    <li> My wife asked for this for Christmas and I priced them at local stores and they were outrageous.  Amazon had them for half the price of the best price I could find locally.  My wife loves it and it smells good on her.  Well worth it based on her reaction and the price comparison with local outlets.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this anywhere else for some reason, it&#x27;s my favorite scent, I&#x27;ve used it for many years.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is my dream. I finally found a product for me. It truly defines me and turns heads. I have never felt more confident</li>
    <li> It pays to get perfume from a store. Very cheap perfume, not the original fragrance it claims to be and the scent goes away after a minute.</li>
    <li> SMELL DELICIOUSSSS &#x3D;)</li>
