    <li> I had a little bit left of this same product that I didn&#x27;t buy online and the colors are vastly different. I think this may not be true bare minerals? Was much darker.</li>

    <li> Bare Minerals Original is the only foundation I use as I have no need for any other facial applications or treatments.  I have been using this product for the past 10 years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Covers well, provides a sun screen as well.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this for several years and won&#x27;t use anything else.  This is quite a bargain rather than buying at a cosmetic store.</li>
    <li> This is just like the one I buy at the ULTA Beauty Store but for less money.&lt;br /&gt;I have read some reviews that state the product is not original nut mine was fine.</li>
    <li> Great product,,, Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing on my sensitive skin!</li>

    <li> I have been using BareMinerals Original foundation for years now.  When I first started, used to get compliments all the time.  Best part of using it is that if I leave it on overnight, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or clog my pores.  This is my go-to makeup for daily use.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Love it and will def. purchase more in the near future ... Will recommend product to friends. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My favorite at a great price.</li>
    <li> When I use this it definitely looks like I&#x27;m wearing foundation. I like the natural look. If you like to look like your wearing foundation then you&#x27;ll love it. It does cover well and hides a lot of flaws. Also easy to put on.</li>
    <li> Great product, but its much lighter than I would like.  I just add a bronzer over it and its okay, but when I get my summer tan, will have to put it up until next winter.  Great price for the size though.</li>
    <li> 5 Star seller - prompt post, excellent product, no fuss.</li>
    <li> Been using this product solely as my foundation for years now.</li>
    <li> Have used for a long time - natural coverage!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5+ years. It covers well and you don&#x27;t have to blend as much as you would have to with liquid foundation. It goes on smoothly over primer or moisturizer. The only issue I have with the product is that, sometimes when my face is dry, it will look sort of &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; on the dry spots of my face. Other than that, this product is GREAT and stays on even after sweating!

    <li> Great product, great seller!</li>
    <li> Natural make-up is the only kind you should have! This is perfectly tinted and covers a multitude of blemishes.</li>
    <li> best stuff for your face no matter what your age is....I&#x27;m 47 and have had zero botox/fillers and I love this natural look.</li>
