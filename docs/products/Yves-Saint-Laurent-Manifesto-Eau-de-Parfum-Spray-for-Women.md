      <li>Wonderful scent, I love it, very elegant yet not too over-powering.</li>
      <li>most YSL frangrances are very good.</li>
      <li>I found it online at a good price.  </li>
      <li>I had received a scent strip advertisement for Manifesto and it reminded me of a body spray I loved years ago but was discontinued, Yardley Lavender &amp; Thyme.</li>
      <li>I bought it because I saw it in a video from Gregory Gorgeous</li>
      <li>, she said she loved it…</li>
      <li>and i especially love the sweet smell it leaves after it sets.</li>
      <li>My fiance is very pleased with this parfum.&lt;br</li>
      <li>An absolutely amazing fragrance that lasts for hours on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I bought it for my mom, but I&#x27;m honestly thinking about stealing it hahahaaaaaa.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked and recommend.</li>
      <li>Love this perfume, it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>However, when it arrived I wasn&#x27;t so in love.</li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>I was in love with the fragrance</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m so in love with it now.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this perfume</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
      <li>AT THE MOST</li>
      <li>More of a fall fragrance.</li>
      <li>but the price is so much better compare to department store</li>
      <li>Love this product...when I wear it...</li>
      <li>I knew I found a winner when I had just as many men.asking me</li>
      <li>My favorite perfumes are Escada Magnetism, which I also buy from Amazon, and Donna Karan Cashmere Mist.  </li>
      <li>Smells very nice and recommend it for anyone who looking for new perfumes for their special ones.</li>
      <li>The scent is very feminine and lingers nicely, but is not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I have the Cologne and they equally smell great.</li>
      <li>IDK if this version differs from the original.</li>
      <li>The bottle I bought at Amazon is actually a gift for my granddaughter, who also loved it when she tried a spritz from my bottle.  </li>
      <li>My second time buying a parfume through Amazon and I have had good luck both times</li>
      <li>I was actually pleasantly surprised at the price, as I payed $100 for my own bottle elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>I have to admit I have used a lot of parfumes and this is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been a Shalimar girl, but this is my new favorite.  </li>
      <li>The bergamot and jasmine in Manifesto had me hooked the first time I smelled it!</li>
      <li>Smelled this on an insert in one of the local department store advertisements and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>Something about Manifesto reminds me of Chanel No. 5: both smell powerful and feminine, exuding class.</li>
      <li>My female friend Loves Yves Saint Laurent and was thrilled to have gotten this for Christmas.</li>
      <li>Came super fast and exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered many perfumes on Amazon (via Amazon Prime directly, not a third party seller) and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with counterfeit products</li>
      <li>Very floral but not overly so.  </li>
      <li>shipping was fast as well.</li>
      <li>, this is the real thing.</li>
      <li>The recepient absolutely LOVES it... and the people being surrounded with this scent as well.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
      <li>Overall definitely not a bad buy.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a bit hard to describe, it&#x27;s not flowery nor woodsy.but more of something in between, i had received a small sample and decided to order it, i am very pleased.</li>
      <li>Very classy.  </li>
      <li>It goes on strong but doesn&#x27;t last as long as others.</li>
      <li>I first smelled this fragrance in an international airport.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Spray for my wife and according to my wife it was not equal in quality or lasting strength as the original product purchased from another retailer one year ago.</li>
      <li>Lovely fragrance, not great staying power.  </li>
      <li>It is a little expensive but it stays on for a longg time and it is worth it :)</li>

    <li> Best perfume I have ever bought for my wife</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a bit hard to describe, it&#x27;s not flowery nor woodsy.but more of something in between, i had received a small sample and decided to order it, i am very pleased. great as a fall and winter fragrance, no need to re-apply.. most YSL frangrances are very good.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent! I bought it for my mom, but I&#x27;m honestly thinking about stealing it hahahaaaaaa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is great, and I got for an incredible value.</li>
    <li> I had received a scent strip advertisement for Manifesto and it reminded me of a body spray I loved years ago but was discontinued, Yardley Lavender &amp; Thyme. I ordered a bottle of this and am completely happy with it!</li>
    <li> Smells very nice and recommend it for anyone who looking for new perfumes for their special ones. Don&#x27;t miss the deal</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all! I bought it because I saw it in a video from Gregory Gorgeous, she said she loved it….blah, I hate it!</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> This delicios fragrance was given as a gift... The recepient absolutely LOVES it... and the people being surrounded with this scent as well.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I also fell for this scent after trying it on a scent strip in a magazine.  (Great marketing!)  I&#x27;ve always been a Shalimar girl, but this is my new favorite.  The scent is very feminine and lingers nicely, but is not overpowering.  The bottle I bought at Amazon is actually a gift for my granddaughter, who also loved it when she tried a spritz from my bottle.  I was actually pleasantly surprised at the price, as I payed $100 for my own bottle elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Love this product...when I wear it...people stop and ask me the name...I knew I found a winner when I had just as many men.asking me what was I  wearing!</li>
    <li> The products was bigger then I though</li>
    <li> Something about Manifesto reminds me of Chanel No. 5: both smell powerful and feminine, exuding class. The bergamot and jasmine in Manifesto had me hooked the first time I smelled it! An absolutely amazing fragrance that lasts for hours on my skin.  I&#x27;ve ordered many perfumes on Amazon (via Amazon Prime directly, not a third party seller) and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with counterfeit products so I would definitely suggest ordering it on here and getting a great deal like I did!!!</li>
    <li> I have to admit I have used a lot of parfumes and this is my new favorite. I like the smell and the lasting time. My second time buying a parfume through Amazon and I have had good luck both times, this is the real thing. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE SMELL BUT IT DOES NOT LAST FOR HOURS MAYBE 2 AT THE MOST</li>
    <li> Second bottle. I was a little hesitated to order this online but the price is so much better compare to department store so I gave it a try. This cologne lasts very long time and I don&#x27;t have to spray again during the day.</li>
    <li> I appreciate that my perfume arrived when they said it would. However, when I tested it at Nordstrom it lasted all day. This one doesn&#x27;t even last 3 hours. I gave 3 stars because it did come when they said it would.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance.  Pricey, however, in comparison to prices in the department stores, this is a good deal!</li>
    <li> Obsessed. I once got a sample of this smell and I knew I had to have it. I&#x27;m so in love with it now. It is a little expensive but it stays on for a longg time and it is worth it :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, I love it, very elegant yet not too over-powering. More of a fall fragrance. Very classy.  A Grown Lady fragrance!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Spray for my wife and according to my wife it was not equal in quality or lasting strength as the original product purchased from another retailer one year ago. It did not appear to be the same product. It was different and my wife won&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this perfume and i especially love the sweet smell it leaves after it sets. shipping was fast as well. would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My female friend Loves Yves Saint Laurent and was thrilled to have gotten this for Christmas. I have the Cologne and they equally smell great.</li>
    <li> smells awesome, and last all day</li>
    <li> I first smelled this fragrance in an international airport. I was in love with the fragrance so when I got home I had to order it. However, when it arrived I wasn&#x27;t so in love. IDK if this version differs from the original. It does last long and I have received several compliments. Overall definitely not a bad buy. In fact, this last longer than my $100 Prada Candy.</li>
    <li> Smelled this on an insert in one of the local department store advertisements and really liked it.  I found it online at a good price.  Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Probably the best perfume on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Both were gifts which made two ladies very happy.  If you are trying to please your lady, this is the gift.</li>
    <li> I liked and recommend.</li>
    <li> Came super fast and exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfumes are Escada Magnetism, which I also buy from Amazon, and Donna Karan Cashmere Mist.  This is now added to my faves.  I actually smeeled YSL Manifesto on a swatch that was delivered with a Macy&#x27;s catalog.  I actually loved the smell of the swatch!  I went to Macy&#x27;s and a 3 oz. bottle is well over $100.  So when I perused Amazon&#x27;s site and found it for $40 less there was no second thought on ordering it.</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance, not great staying power.  Don&#x27;t stop stocking the body cream.</li>
    <li> My fiance is very pleased with this parfum.&lt;br /&gt;O. Helgemo</li>
    <li> wonderful smell, not too overpowering.  Very floral but not overly so.  It goes on strong but doesn&#x27;t last as long as others.</li>
