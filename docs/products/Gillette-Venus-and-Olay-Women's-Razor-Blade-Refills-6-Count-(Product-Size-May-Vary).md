<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent price !!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Olay &amp;#34;bumper&amp;#34; on these replace the outer section of the normal Venus Embrace blade.  I bought these because they were so much less expensive.  The first shave? WOW!!! Loved them!  Great shave, close, über smooth and conditioning.  The second shave, the Olay parts were a little wiggly, but still a good shave.  The third attempt, the bumper, which are actually a soap type product both fell off so there is NO outer bumper to the blade and the plastic bumper holders scrape the skin.  These are therefore the world&#x27;s most EXPENSIVE blade because you can use them twice before the Olay falls off and they become dangerous cutting instruments.  A great idea that was not well thought through or executed.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite razors. They do a great job and leave my legs feeling smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Its amazing. I am definitely buying refills. So smooth, no need to lotion my legs afterwords. A little bulky, smells good.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Venus as a trial and I loved it. It gave my legs a great shave, they felt softer and stayed smoother for longer after I used it. I liked the shave gel bar, it smelled great and was super convenient, the only complaint I would make is that the shave gel was thick and if I didn&#x27;t rinse the blade often it started to feel dull. It&#x27;s not much of a downside and it really was better than trying to use additional shaving cream. I did go out and buy some new cartridges after about two weeks, they were a little pricey but not bad compared to what I&#x27;d be paying for disposables. Overall, it was a great product and definitely something I&#x27;d buy.</li>
    <li> Love these blades! These blades give a silky smooth shave and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that they smell wonderful! I seriously smell these everytime I&#x27;m in the bathroom, they smell that good! The only thing I would change is that the olay bars would last a little longer I was provided this razor via a program run by Venus Gillette.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable shave. These cartridges are expensive, but the multiple blades and the jelly-like surround does make for smoother and more comfortable shaves, and is far less likely to cut my skin. The refills are also hard to find in my local stores; perhaps they are not stocked because of the price point; I often see the handle and 1 refill, which is ultimately more expensive because how many times do I have to buy another handle when the entire point of the refill system is to avoid having multiple versions of the same handle.</li>
    <li> Great razor but costly...reason for one star deduct.</li>
    <li> These razor blades might be a little too expensive but for the job it does, it is worth buying. I first purchased these cartridges after receiving the razor from a program. After testing out the razor I knew instantly I had to dispose of the ones I used before. There was such a big difference. With the old ones I used, I experienced redness even with using shaving cream or conditioner. With these, the five blades work so good as well as the moisturizer bars it has around the blades. There is no need for shaving cream, just putting it in a bit of water will help moisturize it and start doing its job. No need to get into the shower ether, which personally is a big plus for me! Yay for this fantastic razor!</li>
    <li> This razor is extremelly great! The moisture bars left my skin so smooth and way less irritated than any others I&#x27;ve used. I think they&#x27;re well worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I love this Venus and Olay razor as a whole. I&#x27;m so happy I received this thanks to Gillette Venus. It&#x27;s a great shaving experience. My legs are left smooth and silky and it&#x27;s all because of these cartridges. The shave gel that surrounds the 5 blades, is amazing. My legs feel so hydrated and touchable. I find myself constantly looking at my legs thinking &amp;#34;that&#x27;s a smooth, shiny, silky leg you got girl&amp;#34;. Honestly the refill cartridges are a little pricey but I feel like for a good shave that is comfortable and I&#x27;m not cutting myself all the time, I&#x27;m in! It&#x27;s totally worth it. I highly reccomend.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product thanks to Gillette Venus but all of my opinions are my own. I really enjoyed these blades. They stayed really creamy and were really easy to take off and on. Sometimes I have the problem that they fall off or they are super hard to get off but these just slid right and I had no problems with them coming off. They last a very long time which is amazing.</li>
    <li> I did like the closer shave these blades (provided to me for free, thanks to Gillette Venus) give, as well as the scent of the moisturizing bars.  I did not like, however, the way the moisturizer bars are placed on the razor; it would be great if they were more like the other Venus razors in that the bars do not break off after a few uses.  Other than that, these are nice!</li>
    <li> I love my Gillette Venus Olay Women&#x27;s Razor Blades!!! I love the Olay Moisture Bars that come with it which helps lock in my skin&#x27;s moisture for less dryness. My skin feels so smooth and soft after each shave. All you have to do is wet  the razor to activate a light lather. The Olay Moisture Bar is so moisturizing that I don&#x27;t even need separate shaving gel. Another bonus point is the razor cartridges are very easy to change and the refill razor cartridges fit any Venus razor handle. Thank you Gillette Venus &amp; Olay for giving me the opportunity to try the product for free and, more importantly, for helping me &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; my shaving time in half. :)</li>
    <li> First off, thanks to Gillette Venus for letting me try this product! Its such a nice feeling putting a brand new razor blade onto your razor! 5 blades, and the Olay moisture bar keep my dry and sensitive skin nice and silky smooth! I honestly have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I was selected to test this product from Gillette venus. I loved how it worked well with my skin tone. It left my skin soft and radiant. With most razors I get razor burn and cuts all of my legs but it was different with the venus and olay. They put two great products into one and I hope they do it more often because there are good outcomes from it. It worked great with my sensitive skin. Couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> I did not like the other moisture bar razors I&#x27;ve tried in the past, but these I do like. They have 5 blades so it gives me a close enough shave , this vanilla creme scent smells delicious, and the moisture bars really give a very moisturizing shaving experience. Everything that I&#x27;ve shaved was razor bump free, stubble-free, cut free and very moisturized. I did not get cut either the first time using these as i usually do the first time using any razor because of the new sharp blades. I dislike how fast the moisture bars get used up but I think it&#x27;s much more convenient to use this one product than using shaving cream which makes the shaving process so much longer and annoying.using this razor makes me not want to go back to the normal routine of using shaving cream.I&#x27;ve also found that shaving cream never smells good to me but these moisture bars do! Thanks to a program ran by Venus I was able to try this amazing razor that i will now add into my razoshaving routine.ng.</li>
    <li> Worth the price! I was able to try these via a program from Venus and I fell in love. They left my legs smelling great and feeling even better. The Olay moisturizing bar is awesome although it does make my shelf a little sticky. I used the clip that the razor came with and that sloved that. Venus did a great job on this one.</li>
    <li> I received this from Venus Gillette to give a proper review over so here it goes. I attached a cartridge to the razor body and to my surprise I ended up loving this product. I don&#x27;t normally buy this brand or single razors with cartridges due to the price and honestly I hope this one lasts a while because I probably won&#x27;t be able to buy another anytime soon due to it being too expensive compared to disposable razors with more quantity available at a lower price.I did enjoy the close shave and smoothness of this razor though and I felt that it did a very great job. I also enjoyed that the scent of the gel strips weren&#x27;t too overpowering. I loved the product and I had a great experience but it is just too expensive for me!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s really handy that this razor allows for replacement blades because I really like the handle. It fits perfectly in your hand to provide a great shave, so only replacing the blade is great. I was able to try this product for free courtesy of Gilette Venus, but the opinions this product are all my own. This razor will probably go through a lot of replacement blades if you are a daily user. The shaving gel bar didn&#x27;t last me more than 5 use when I had to start finding complicated ways to use it on my skin before shaving as to not waste it. However, if you are a weekly or even monthly user, I really recommend this product. The replacement blade is easy to put on and hassle free.</li>
    <li> Finally there is a razor t g at works better than a guys razor!! These left my legs smoothe AND moisturized! ! Who ever knew you could get both in one!?!? U love them and they smell amazing !!!♡ thank you Venus for letting me try these and review them :)</li>
    <li> Smooth, close shave every time without over drying your skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is so sensitive that every time I have ever shaved I broke out in a bad case of razor-burn, which is not only painful, but my skin has an ugly irritated look to it. I received the Venus Olay Razor via a program run by Venus, where they sent me this specific cartridge to try out. At first I was skeptical with having no luck at finding a decent razor before, but I opened the package and used the razor immediately.  I was so amazed at how the moisture bars created a lather that made the shaving process easy and my legs silky. I have now used this product for a week and am more than pleased by the quality of this product. It would be nice if the cartridges lasted a month, but 2 weeks minimum is decent enough. I highly recommend this product to those with sensitive skin and looking to have radiantly smooth and silky legs.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try these blades for free thanks for a promotion run by Venus. These blades are absolutely amazing. They gave me one of the closes shaves I&#x27;ve ever had, and the best part? No shaving cream required!!! However, the one thing I seriously dislike about these blades is that the moisture bars run out very quickly, meaning that you have to spend money to replace the blades often. All in all, I think the blades are worth it. Try them out!</li>
    <li> I love these razor blades. I received the razor with a blade inside the package from a promotion that Venus was having and I loved it so much that I decided to go out and buy the refills. I have tried numerous shavers and I always have hair growing back the next day and my legs are so dry but with these blades I don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving for 5 days and i don&#x27;t have to moisturize my legs either. Its the best combo package. The only thing I am not too keen about is that I have only shaved 2 times and my first one is almost 1/4 done but its a fair trade off for not having to shave everyday. The blades might be a bit expensive but the outcome is worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this razor. I&#x27;ve used it about 3 times and each time has been amazing. I don&#x27;t have to use any extra soaps or shaving creams because the moisturizing bars on the razor create an amazing substance to shave with when activated with water. The soap bars on the razor also smell great! The razor package comes with a holder that suction cups to the shower wall, so you don&#x27;t have to put the razor down on a surface, causing the soap bars to get stuck and unusable, which is super convenient. The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because of the film that the soap bars leave on my skin after I use it. In order to get the film off of my skin, I had to use soap to wash it off. It was a sticky-like feel left on my skin after I rinsed it off with just water. But other than the film, I love this product and will definitely buy refills! I got a free sample from a website called BzzAgent. Check the website out! It is super convenient for trying out products and seeing how you like them before having to buy the product!</li>
    <li> I received the razor through bzzagent free to try, don&#x27;t get me wrong, the blades are awesome and the fact that you don&#x27;t need shaving cream is great. But the little bars don&#x27;t last long at all.): a few leg shavings and they&#x27;re nearly gone. It&#x27;s a little expensive for how quickly they go. But if you can afford it, it&#x27;s a pretty great razor.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve used this summer so far! It gave me the closest shave ever. My legs do feel soft. I was easily able to shave my legs with no nicks at all. I didn&#x27;t even have to use shaving cream, but I did use regular soap. The razor was not rough on my skin and I had NO razor bumps either. I did have total control of the razor. I do have sensitive skin to where I can&#x27;t shave my legs everyday or else i get razor burns, but this shaver allowed me to shave everyday with No razor burns at all!! I will definitely buy this razor! I&#x27;m trying the product for free thanks to Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this razor and blades from the company to test it out through Bzzagent. I am so glad that I was able to do this because this razor is awesome. It keeps my legs super soft and the razor smells great. It cuts my time in half since I do not have to worry about applying shaving cream before I shave. Awesome job Gillette!</li>
    <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t dry out as much after shaving my legs. I like that feeling. I noticed that moisture bar part has gotten smaller since they first  came out.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this razor and blades free via Venus for testing and reviews! I really REALLY love how quick and easy this product makes shaving!! Who doesn&#x27;t love anything that makes life easier? This product makes me not really mind shaving!! The only thing I wish is that the soap/olay area lasted longer! I kept it out of water once i was done using it, but it did last about 5 shaves then it was done, but I still used the razor but with soap! I am very thankful I had the opportunity to use this product! I will be buying this in the near future!</li>
    <li> I love these so much because the really do mosturize your legs and they smell amazing. I find I get a close shave with these my only complaint is that the gel bars dissolve quickly. Over all I highly recommend. Disclaimer: I was sent this by Venus for review but this opinion is completly my own.</li>
    <li> i received this product as part of a promotion from Venus and Olay, and after using this razor for the first time I was very impressed by how gentile it really was on my legs! Usually, I don&#x27;t love the first shave with any razor because I have sensitive skin and the blades irritate m legs. But with these razor heads with the Olay bars, my legs don&#x27;t feel irritated and itchy!! love love love!! and the refills are a decent price!! go Venus and Olay!!!</li>
    <li> I Recieved This Razor Free Thanks To Gillette Venus &amp; I Was Very Impressed. Usually When I Shave My Legs I Have To Go Over Them Twice To Get The Close Shave I Want But With This Razor Once Was Enough. It Leaves Your Legs Smooth From The Moisture Bars. It Also Smells Really Good.</li>
    <li> I got to try this for free through a Gillette Venus promotion and i absolutely love that these come in their own little containers. Keeps my children out of them and love the moisture bars that come with them! No shaving gel and my legs are super soft after just one shave with them!</li>
    <li> I tried the Venus &amp; Olay razor thanks to a campaign run by Venus. This razor was AWESOME. Smooth and silky legs without shave gel or lotion. Cuts out the mess of shaving while still producing great results.</li>
    <li> Ladies I just received my Venus &amp; olay razor and this 5 blade razor is amazing and I buy the pack and it last me a while I don&#x27;t even. Use shaving cream for my legs because when u using the Venus &amp; Olay razor is moisturize while u shave leaving your skin smooth and soft and did I mention how good it smells comes in different fragrance  I recommend ladies go buy this product summer is here have those legs looking amazing</li>
    <li> I got to try these for free thanks to Gillette Venus. They&#x27;re a great five blade head for shaving, it gives you a nice close shave without leaving any stubble. The soap bars around the blades however do not last as long as the blades do. I found myself using it after the soap was gone with regular shaving cream because the blades were still good. They&#x27;re a great product if you&#x27;re someone that likes the convenience of not having to use shaving cream (it&#x27;ll cut the shave time down!).</li>
    <li> I got to try this product through Venus, and I am very satisfied. These cartridges are a little pricey but are very worth it for the shave that I get. The scent is so refreshing. I love that they are 5 blade cartridges and that you do get 4 at a time. I&#x27;ll continue to buy these as needed. This is the best razor that I have used thanks to these cartridges, considering my sensitive skin is not bothered when I shave with these. Great product!</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette Venus promotion I got these for free. They were pretty easy to put on the razor. I have noticed that these blades tend to dull out pretty quickly and the moisturizing bar makes my skin feel oily. However I got an incredibly close shave and zero cuts with this product. With most razors I usually only get a close shave and many cuts or I get no cuts and sorta kinda close shave.</li>
    <li> Well I fairly enjoyed using the Venus &amp; Olay razor, which was provided for free by by Gillette Venus. I am usually one to go for the cheapest razor at the store so it is rare for me to purchase a good name brand product. The first thing I noticed was the scent, it smelled so clean and fresh. I have EXTREMELY sensitive so I was a little apprehensive to use a razor with 5 blades and without shaving cream. I made sure my skin and the moisture bars were wet and the razor glided smoothly across my skin. In the end my skin took well to the moisture shave bars around the razor. The gently mild formula soothed my skin and made it soft to the touch. I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially those with sensitive skin like me! The only negative thing I would have to say is that the moisture bars ran out after the fifth or sixth use.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette Venus, I was able to try this product for free. I like the fact that with this razor I can shave in no time. The fact that it is so moisturizing eliminates my worry that I am going to cut myself. However, I wish that it gave me a closer shave. It&#x27;s also a little bulky. It does leave my skin feeling great, and is perfect for when you don&#x27;t feel like spending forever shaving. Just don&#x27;t expect that it&#x27;s going to give you a super close shave.</li>
    <li> I received this from a promotional site. The razors are easy to apply to the handle and are great because they do not require gel or soap for a shave. No razor bumps and no missed spots because of large head.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor with 1 cartridge and 1 shower hanger as a promotion from Gillette Venus. I was impressed by the razor, no shave irritation on my sensitive skin. However, it is cheaper to buy the razor instead of the replacement cartridges but if you think about it.. 4 refills for about twenty dollars is cheaper than buying an 8 dollar razor 4 times. Smells nice and leaves skin smooth. I plan on purchasing the cartridges when I run out of my free one.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Gillette Venus. The moisture bars only last about a week, and for that price I would say its kind of expensive. BUT venus razor&#x27;s are the way to go! The blade does the job it needs too!</li>
    <li> I used these Venus &amp; Olay Razor blades for the first time and I was really surprised on how well they cut. The blades glided across my skin so well. I was left feeling fresh after just a few cuts. The Venus &amp; Olay Razor blades really meet my expectations above and beyond. They really got the job well done. The Blades are kind of expensive but overall a really good product I will be buying again. I also received for free thanks to Gillette Venus so you really can&#x27;t bet that. You should really try.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! It&#x27;s not as long lasting as I would have hoped but not having to use shave cream was amazing! Long days lead to a 5 minute shower and shaving my legs became a little easier. I really wish the razors refills were cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor free via a Gillette Venus promotional campaign.</li>
    <li> I put these on my Venus Swirl handle and it&#x27;s the best shave I could ask for. My legs feel really soft and the moisture bars don&#x27;t disappear after one use like many razors I&#x27;ve tried. I received a free razor from Venus and I&#x27;m so glad I got to try it because I will definitely be buying these soon.</li>
    <li> First off, let me just say that this is the only razor I will use anymore. I have very sensitive legs and need all the moisture I can get. This razor isn&#x27;t perfect though, but what is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;This helps add moisture to my shaving routine, I don&#x27;t even need shaving cream when I shave my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m out of shaving cream, I can get away with shaving my legs without it using this razor.&lt;br /&gt;The razor head is flexible so it&#x27;s easy to get around the contours of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;The razor refills have FIVE blades! This gives me such a close shave, it&#x27;s hard to find a lot of razor head refills that have more than four blades. I won&#x27;t go back to any less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Like I said earlier, I have super sensitive legs that become super itchy after shaving and no matter what I will get razor bumps. The more moisture I can get the better my legs feel and look. I wish I could say this replaces my shaving cream, but I still need shave cream. Anyone that doesn&#x27;t have these problems can definitely just use the razor by itself! Another issue that I have is that the moisturizing bars dull down and don&#x27;t even touch your skin after a few uses. Thankfully, the blades are still useful, but I wish the moisture bars were still usable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will use anything that will help me get a smoother shave and reduce the sensitivity and itching. This razor helps so much for that so I will never go back to anything without! I wish the moisture bars lasted longer though, that is my number one issue! But I do recommend this for any type of person. I&#x27;m so glad this product exists!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this razor via a program run by Venus.</li>
    <li> These razor blade refills are awesome, I had no trouble attaching it to my razor at all.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the moisturizing sides of this, it left my legs feeling and looking super hydrated and smooth! Definitely one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> Works great. Good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Venus &amp;  Olay razor that I got through a program run by Venus! Not having to use additional shaving cream was seriously the best because I always make a mess with shaving cream as well as using money to buy it every month. Another positive of this razor is that I  comes with a hook to hold the razor on the wall of the shower. It left out the opportunity for it to fall on the ground or get lost; it is very convenient. After shaving with the Venus &amp; Olay razor, my legs are SO soft and smooth! Overall, this is definitely my go to razor that is a must have for quality and convenience!</li>
    <li> I liked these razors a lot and the smell is amazing. It&#x27;s a really comfortable shave, and the Olay moisture bars really made my skin feel so soft and smooth while I was actually shaving, and stayed soft and smooth all day long as well. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because of how fast the moisture bars wear out, and it could be a little bit of a closer shave. But overall I am very satisfied with the razors, and would recommend them to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to try this product for free, thanks to Gillette Venus</li>
    <li> I got this from a program run by venus to try out and let me just tell you this is the beat razor I have EVER used in my life.I usually dry shave with Schick hydro silk and after using this gillette venus and olay razor I am never going back! I have never in my life had such a easy time shaving,never had my legs so silky and smooth without having razor bumps or a bunch of cuts.this razor blew my mind away it has a bar with soap so everytime you dip it in water and shave it makes it so you dont have to use any soap or shaving cream which is great for me since I usually dry shave and shave fast.it also has a bar to moisturize your skin as you shave which actually works quite well(didnt have to put lotion on afterwards) saves me a extra few minutes.it has five razor blades that are perfect shaped to get close to the skin and get curves that other razors usually miss. It also has a nice soft grip and a shower hook for easy storage and to be able to keep in the shower. Very easy to put the cartridge on and off.i DEFINENTLY recommend this razor to anyone who usually dry shaves or is in a hurry because this razor does the job and I also cut my time of shaving from thirty minutes to fifteen.</li>
    <li> The best but too pricy.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Venus! These cartridges are great... they are in nice packaging and are still fully intact when you open them! The only downfall is that because the moisturizing strips don&#x27;t last but 1 week, you would pretty much have to be rich to be able to afford replacing the cartridges. If you don&#x27;t mind using the razor with the melted off strips after 1-2 weeks, you should be fine, because the razor itself is a great product! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the moisturizing strips are amazing and work wonders, but they are just not long lasting. That&#x27;s why I gave this 4 stars - it&#x27;s a good product, but you&#x27;d have to be rich to afford replacing the cartridges all the time.</li>
    <li> The pack is great! I brings five and it can last for 3 months or more if you use them correctly. I love it. Leaves my skin feeling flawless and fresh. I tried this product for free from Gillette Venus. It is great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too pleased with this product. It works wonders but after two uses the bars start to go away and the razor begins to suck. I personally  don&#x27;t like it, it means you gotta change it every other week. So buying these would definitely  help that problem. (:</li>
    <li> These razor blade cartridges are okay, but not the best. I&#x27;ve been using them for shaving my legs and underarms for a few weeks, and my overall shave experience really hasn&#x27;t improved any than when I was using a different brand&#x27;s razor. These razors never really provided me with as close as a shave as possible, and I even got razor burn a few times! They aren&#x27;t the worst, but they also aren&#x27;t something I&#x27;m going to spend my money on. I do really love how you don&#x27;t have to keep buying individual razors with the blades that aren&#x27;t interchangeable, but many companies already do this and one company has better razor blades than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I tried this product for free thanks to Gillette Venus.)</li>
    <li> This one is a good one, but it really depends on what you want to use it for. The added softness from the razor blade has cut down on my cuts and ingrown hairs - by a lot. It also leaves my skin leaving a whole lot softer than most of my other razors do (including other Venus razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the softness and lotion comes at a price - a larger razor blade head than other razor blades. This can make it a bit unwieldy. If all you want to do is shave large areas of your legs (like calves or thighs), this is perfect. I usually have to supplement this razor with another Venus razor in order to get smaller areas like behind the knees. It&#x27;s worth it, though, to avoid having to lotion up or worry about bleeding from my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another note, the moisture bar on these can dry up pretty fast. You&#x27;ll probably only get about a week or two of shaving compared to the usual 3 or 4 weeks I can get out of other razors. The razor blades are still okay, but it&#x27;s just run out of the moisture bars. I enjoy the excuse to replace the blades (and the clear reminder in order to avoid infections from bad blades and whatnot), but not everyone may feel the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a nice, gentle vanilla scent. I honestly can&#x27;t smell it over my shower gel once I&#x27;m showering, but before I do that, I can smell it. It&#x27;s strongest when you first open the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product as part of a promotion with Venus.</li>
    <li> New fave razor! I didn&#x27;t think the 5 blades would make that big of a difference, but these work incredibly well. I can shave my whole leg without even rinsing off the blade. Glides across your skin like butter and has a nice scent too.</li>
    <li> I like the way these razors moisturize my legs. I still have to use lotion but they give a good clean shave without having to go over areas twice.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend purchasing the Gillette Venus Olay Women&#x27;s Razor Blade Refill! I got some compliments of Gilette Venus and Olay, and they are STILL lasting me to this day! They are not like some other razors where they claim to be reusable, but in reality only last not even a week before you have to replace them. Mine has been lasting for a lot longer than a week, and it is still working as great as day one! You may be saying that the price is a little expensive, but believe me when I say that you are really getting your money&#x27;s worth out of this. You will NOT be disappointed! They still keep my legs smooth and stubble free just like day one.</li>
    <li> Love that you don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream with this Shaver.  Convenient &amp; easy to use! My favorite! I received this from Gillette Venus for free to sample.</li>
    <li> These blades are great!  The dual Olay strip on the top and bottom makes my skin feel smooth-- don&#x27;t even need to use shaving cream.  I loved the scent as is, but I wonder if they will come out with different varieties in the future.</li>
    <li> Love Venus razors but the olay bar makes them a little too clunky for my preference.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy though.</li>
    <li> I love these razors !  A bit pricy i would say but worth every penny! They last for a pertty great while ! Thank to gillette venus for letting try this product out for free!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try these razor refills as a free promotion from Gillette Venus. I also got a chance to try the full razor as well. I swear I have nothing bad to say about these refills. Not only did the razor get rid of my hard to reach stubble, but it left my legs as smooth as ever!!!!! I love these refills, my legs were hydrated. After shaving it was like I just applied lotion to them. They were smooth, shiny, and STUBBLE FREE. This is the best razor I have ever tried. I can not stop raving about it to all my friends. I will definitely be repurchasing this and the razor! :D</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try this product for free thanks to Gillete Venus! I am so glad I got this opportunity the razor blade is different than any others that I have tried. The moisturizing pads on either side of the razor makes for a wonderfully close shave no need for shaving cream at all! After I tried this product only once I noticed instantly smoother and moisturized skin. This is a great product for anyone wanting to save money on buying after shave or shaving cream or looking to save time in the morning by cutting out lotion time! Give this product a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Being a first time user of this product I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. After reading that basically all you do is wet the area you want to shave, and the razor and go. I found this to be exactly true! It was by far the easiest shaving experience I have ever had, and would be perfect for individuals on the go! Because of the built in Olay bars between the razor there is virtually no worry about cutting yourself, I tried to shave very fast and tried tricky areas that I would normally but myself on, but the Venus &amp; Olayâ¢ Razor stood the test, I didn&#x27;t doubt it once. I got an incredibly smooth shave without any razor burn. The Olay bars left my skin so touchable and soft it was amazing! It even left a bit of a good sent that both lasted after I dried off. I also thought the little stand that will stick to the walls of your shower was a very good idea! The only thing I did not like about the razor is I feel like the Olay bars will or do run out rather quickly, but that may have been because I continually ran it under water to keep it rom getting clogged. The other thing is that if you have dark hair, your hair kind of sticks in the Olay bars and you have to was them off and run your hands over it if you want to keep a clean razor. Overall, I absolutely loved this product and I would like to give a thank you S/O to Venus for giving me the opportunity to try their product! This is my new razor brand that I will be using from now on, and I will definitely be encouraging my friends to by it because everyone deserves beautiful, touchable, smooth legs.</li>
    <li> These razors I received from Gillette VENUS for review purposes and I loved them. The make your legs look and feel so silky smooth and you can go longer between shaves.</li>
    <li> I got this fro free in a promotion thanks to Gillette Venus. I absolutely love this. The new blades make the razor feel like new all the time. I always get consistently results and the blades are durable so I could use this for many shaves before I have to replace it. If you get the razor also the the refill pack. It will be worth it.</li>
    <li> These blades definitely cut down on imitation, as I have sensitive skin. I think this is due to the moisture bar that these razors provide. My only complaint would be that I wish I could get these at a more affordable price, but I guess that is what coupons are for! Also, I did recieve these razors from a Gillette Venus promotion, but I would not come on here and say this if I did not 100% believe it!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this razor thanks to Gillette Venus! It&#x27;s by far one of my favorite razors, if not the best one I have ever used! It made my experience so much better, easier, and faster if compared to other regular razors. The two moisture bars made my experience so much more comfortable, there&#x27;s no need for one to use shaving cream or anything before. The razor blades ran over my skin so much smoother than other razors have, and what was even better is that I got no irration at all after shaving, which was always something almost normal for me to experience since I have very sensitive skin. However, I think there&#x27;s still need to put on a little bit of lotion to moisturize after because my skin still felt a little dry after shaving, although that might only be me.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a couple of years now and will probably never use another razor again! I have very sensitive skin and cannot use shaving gel or cream.This razor with the Olay shea butter body wash is the perfect combination for me!! Also, I am so excited that I can get this on subscribe and save again!</li>
    <li> Got to try these as a promotion through Gillette Venus. I love how the sent isn&#x27;t overpowering, just very subtle. With how large the moisture bars are, you don&#x27;t need shave gel but, as a consequence you have to constantly unclog the razor because it&#x27;s clogged with it&#x27;s own moisture. I had no problem with razor burn. There is a lot of unnecessary plastic on the sides which make it large, so there are missed spots and, is mostly unusable for bikini areas. After a week, both moisture bars fell off. I&#x27;m still using the razor without the moisture bars because the blades themselves are very good quality.</li>
    <li> This is an average razor with a slimy bar of soap attached to it. You don&#x27;t get a close shave, it&#x27;s hard to use on rounded areas like knees, and my skin is still dry after using it. Once the soap dissolves after a couple of weeks, you&#x27;re left with a normal razor that has two chunks of plastic sticking out, making it an even worse product than before. If you like Venus razors, stick with the original... this product is terrible.</li>
    <li> I recieved this free from Gillette Venus, it was awesome &amp; then after a few uses the blades got very dull &amp; wouldn&#x27;t give me a close enough shave. The gel bars got all slimy &amp; left a nasty residue on the side of my tub</li>
    <li> I really like this razor, I got it from Gillette Venus to sample for free. I love that I don&#x27;t have to use any shaving gel. I love the 5 blade system; I feel that it prevented alot of ingrowns.</li>
    <li> Love it! I like the feeling after shaving my legs and the nice feeling to them</li>
    <li> I tried this razor free, from Venus in exchange for my honest review. I really loved it, but I feel like $20 is a bit high which is the only reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5. The moisture bars were the really amazing part, not only do you not need shaving cream, but my legs were left feeling softer, and smoother than if I had used a really expensive cream. It&#x27;s seriously eliminates my need to put on lotion after I shave. I also got a really close shave without much effort, propably because of the 5 blades on the razor. I was worried about the moisture bars melting away too soon, but I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a couple of weeks now and they&#x27;re still going strong. One day, I forgot to hang it back up though, and it got a little stick and some of it came off onto the side of the tub. So it really is important to use the shower hanger that comes free when you buy the razor. As long as you do, it should last just fine. I actually hang mine on my mirror instead of in the shower, and I think that helps even more since there&#x27;s less over all moisture. Other than that, I was really really impressed with it, and I&#x27;m going to continue to buy the refills, because I feel that not having to buy shaving cream, balances out the price difference.</li>
    <li> I did enjoy this product thanks for venus sending me the razor. I would like to say that the price is a bit much. I do like that there are five blades to get the legs nicely shaven. I would recommend to buy if there is a good deal on these razor . I do like how soft it makes my legs .</li>
    <li> Works well, I replace about every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> These moisturizing strips are a stroke of genius! They are three in one! They eliminate the need for shaving cream, and eliminate the need for moisturizing after shaving. I was lucky enough to try this product for free through a Venus promotion , and will be purchasing more of! The only down side is the moisture bars longevity, the five blade razor will continue to give you a close shave but you will loose the benifits of moisture strips.  Thank you Venus Jalet for allowing me to try the product free through your promotions</li>
    <li> Would definitely recommend great buy!</li>
    <li> As a long time Venus fan I must say the Venus with olay is my new favorite! Thanks to Gillette for the free sample I was very pleased! With the 2 moisture strips surrounding the pivoting blade made for a super quick convenient shave leaving silky smooth skin behind!</li>
    <li> I received a Venus and Olay starter kit from Gillette. I like the smoothness that these cartridges allow but the Olay bars make the razor a bit bulky and difficult to maneuver around certain areas of the skin. They do smell great, and they do make for a smooth shave but I definitely can&#x27;t use these razors alone without shave cream. They are priced to match similar cartridge packages.</li>
    <li> The gel bars smell amazing.  You get a very close shave and you legs are very silky and smooth. This product is a must.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a promotion.&lt;br /&gt;I loved these razors! They offer a great moisturizing shave. It also gets right to the skin, so your skin will be super soft. The only downfall is that these only offer one or two good shaves before you need to refill the blades.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor with 1 cartridge and 1 shower hanger as a promotion from Gillette Venus. Overall, I thought the razor was good. It was easy to put the handle and the cartridge together. The razor gave me a nice close shave of my legs, leaving my legs soft, smooth, and shiny (I did have fast regrowth though). The first thing I noticed about the razor is its amazing the scent from the Olay lotion part. It has this amazing calming scent, which is enhanced when it is wet in the shower. I love the scent! Also, because of the Olay lotion part, no shaving cream or soap is needed. The razor did not give me any nicks or cuts, even the first time I used it. The handle was easy to hold and maneuver around the curves in my legs. I did not use the shower hanger because I find that suction cups don&#x27;t stick to tiles well and that they eventually fall, which may damage the razor.  For the price and quality you really can&#x27;t beat it. Overall, I had a good experience with the razor and would recommend.</li>
    <li> love the olay venus! it&#x27;s the only razor i will use. you don&#x27;t even need shaving cream! makes your skin feel like silk and cuts down on dry skin</li>
    <li> These razors are really nice because they have very hydrating shave bars on them. Although, I have noticed razor bumps on my skin from only one use. I do love that the razor is scented and its a nice bonus! I got this Venus and Olay razor free to try from a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from Gillette Venus. Im super excited to shave now! The blades have such a close shave and they make your legs so smooth. I will only be buying Gillette Venus olay razors and refills from now on!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Venus Olay Women&#x27;s Razor Blade is by far the most best razor blade i have used. This cartridge has a olay moisture bars and a 5  blades to shave you close and get all the hairs.It smells great and leaves skin so silky.Thank you Gilletee venus for letting me try this amazing product for free.</li>
    <li> The razor came in an easy to open package that was great normally thos thick plastic packages are hard to open the razor has two big moisture bars one on top Wichita is yellow and smells like pina colada and a white one on bottom Wichita had no smell I must say if your a clumsy shaver please be careful this shaver gets very slippery and it&#x27;s hard to shave your arm pits with as well I really didn&#x27;t feel like I got a close enough shave I had to go over it again with another shaver the moisture bars did leave my legs smooth and didn&#x27;t cause a break out maybe it they sold just the bar so you could use it when you shave ..and the bars run out fast on the shaver mine were done after one session but hey I recueved it free completely of a program ran for venus and that&#x27;s great now I know I don&#x27;t need to buy them befor I waste money but not everyone is the same they might work for you</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Razor with 1 cartridge and 1 shower hanger as a promotion from Gillette Venus. Overall, I thought the razor was good. It was easy to put the handle and the cartridge together. The razor gave me a nice close shave of my legs, leaving my legs soft, smooth, and shiny. The first thing I noticed about the razor is its amazing the scent from the Olay soap/lotion part. It has this amazing calming scent, which is enhanced when it is wet in the shower. I love the scent! Also, because of the Olay soap/lotion part, no shaving cream or soap is needed. The razor did not give me any nicks or cuts, even the first time I used it, which is when the razor is at its sharpest since it dulls over time. I did not use the shower hanger because I find that suction cups don&#x27;t stick to tiles well and that they eventually fall, which may damage the razor. Also, I prefer to leave my razor out of the shower, so that it can air dry to prevent rust and mold. Leaving it in the shower leaves it constantly moist and can lead to mold/rust. The handle was easy to hold and maneuver around the curves in my legs. The one thing I did not like about the razor is it&#x27;s small surface area. The razor I usually use (Schick Intuition) has a larger surface area. Overall, I had a good experience with the razor and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this razor after being selected for a campaign by Venus. I was skeptical at first because I typically use a male razor or a disposable razor. If you have ever used one you know you are prone to getting tiny cuts if you shave to quick. This razor was amazing! After one stroke I could tell how moisturized my leg was and was cut free even with shaving fast. The smell is amazing and the little Olay bars make your legs feel smooth without the need of shaving cream! I will definitely be purchasing refills and highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> I was sent this product by Gillette to try out and review and I have to say I&#x27;m in total shock! The moisture bars on this razor blade make it unlike any other razor. If you hate the hassle of having to use shaving cream and putting on lotion, or if you are just in a hurry, then this is a great product for you. It cuts about 10 minutes out of my beauty routine and has the same moisturizing properties as an Olay moisturizer would. My only complaint would have to be the prices of the refills but all razor refills are expensive and out of the ones I have tried, I would definitely purchase these.</li>
    <li> Great price if you love this razor like I do. Leaves skin silky smooth and moisterized !</li>
    <li> I received these blades along with the razor thanks to Venus, and I liked them quite a bit, but the shave could be closer. The moisture strips were really nice, and I didn&#x27;t need to use shaving cream at all! They lather up when you wet them, and you can feel it working as you shave.  It&#x27;s a bit gooey, but I really didn&#x27;t have a problem with that at all.  I didn&#x27;t get a single nick or cut which was nice.  The only problem was just the short stubble it didn&#x27;t seem to shave by my knees and shins.  No matter how many times I went over the area, it wouldn&#x27;t shave it.  I don&#x27;t have that problem with other Venus razors.  It could just have been this particular one, however.  Regardless, I liked these blades, and would use it again.</li>
    <li> I bough these after receiving the razor from Venus to test out. I expected the razor cushions to last me longer and have these in the storage, but i had to open them sooner than expected. They are a great product, moisturize my legs, prevent bumps but it doesn&#x27;t last long. It was a great product to use but because they run out so fast, in the long run this product would be extremely expensive.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gilette Venus, I was able to test this product for free, and now I&#x27;m hooked! Seriously these are the most effortless razor blades I have ever used/tried and they even smell good.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette, I got to try the Venus &amp; Olay razor and cartridges for free. So far, it has exceeded all my expectations. I&#x27;ve read a few comments that the Venus &amp; Olay refills are pricey. But, in my experience, a lot of refills are. And, you get something extra here. You don&#x27;t have to buy shaving creme. And, even it is it pricier than what you normally pay, it is worth every penny, because of the convenience. I&#x27;d definitely buy it. I&#x27;ve been using one cartridge for about a month now. And, even though I don&#x27;t shave every day, I&#x27;m surprised it has lasted. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll do just fine for another month at least.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and so far so good. You don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream or even soap, you just use water!  I love that it takes one step out of the chore of shaving!  It works great on my underarms, I have t had any ingrown hairs since using, which is sometimes an issue with me. My legs seem to be more moisturized than when using shaving cream. The only bad thing I about it is it is just a tad bulky, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I will be purchasing again. I am trying the product for free from Gilette Venus.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette Venus I was able to try this product for free! The first thing I noticed about these cartridges are how easily they snap on and off unlike other razors. This is surprisily one of my FAVORITE attributes. I just have this weird fear that in going to cut my finger with other razors.. I shave every other day with this razor. Sometimes with.. sometimes without shaving cream and the moisture bars have been lasting a long time! I use my razors over a week at a time and the bars have definantly lasted over a week. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was provided this product from a promotion run by Gillette Venus.  I have since repurchased this product over and over again and will not use any other brand from now on.  My reasons for this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Extra moisture added&lt;br /&gt;-cuts shaving time in half because of the added cream&lt;br /&gt;-the scent is amazing&lt;br /&gt;-no nicks or cuts&lt;br /&gt;-easy to attach&lt;br /&gt;-smooth skin! skin seems to get softer and smoother with every use</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this product overall experience was ok the scent was great thanks to Gillette Venus for letting my try this product for free its overall great product</li>
    <li> Terrible. I love the Venus razor and got the Olay refills on my subscribe and save plan because they were cheaper than the Breeze. Big mistake. The little &amp;#34; gel bars &amp;#34; on each side of the razor are super gooey once wet and the soap gets very stringy. Weird. Then after about 2 shaves the little bars fall completely off. My daughter had same experience. It wasn&#x27;t just that specific package either-it was multiple packs. I didn&#x27;t find my legs any smoother and I&#x27;m certainly not willing to pay to use a razor twice before tossing.</li>
    <li> I do like the razors and how they make my skin feel, though they are a bit pricey to replace. But other than that, they are great and easy to put on. I did receive this as part of a promotion by the brand for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I really love the moisturizing soap that it comes with instead of using soap or shaving gel when shaving which saves time when shaving. I just dislike that the razor is still good and not dull, but after using 2 weeks the soap is almost gone and then I&#x27;d have to throw away after it&#x27;s gone. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d purchase a set of refills because I thought it was going to last longer, but it really doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s worth it, but waste of money because it&#x27;s not long lasting of the moisturizer.  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I loved the actual razor that these fit, however the blades are not worth the price you pay. I received one free from Gillette to test and review and loved how soft and smooth my legs were. But the lotion around the blades did not last long at all. It took maybe 3 times and I was already in need of a new razor. The blades were still very sharp and durable, but it seems to be a waste if the lotion does not last long. I ended up just keeping the blade on and using a different shaving gel. Seemed like a waste to throw perfectly good blades away.</li>
    <li> I will be continuing to buy this razor! I tried this product free thanks to Gilette and The only negative about this product is that the moisture bars get used up quickly with everyday use and this can get quite costly if you change the razor head everytime the bars run out, My razor bars were worn down after about 1 week of use. The blades are still sharp so I am continuing to use this razor with shaving cream until the blades are dull and then I will switch the razor head out. These are a bit pricey but I love the close shave and no irritation this razor provides so I will be continuing to purchase this razor/refill heads.</li>
    <li> I recieved this free from Gillette Venus to try out.&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges are easy to apply to the handle. Once you start shaving I feel like the razor begins to feel slimy from the moisturizer and it begins to slide and does not get a close shave. This razor worked great within the first week, two times of shaving. After the two times shaving the moisturizer in the razor faded away and there was nothing there but dull blades. I was very disappointed because I feel like other venus razors last longer that do not have the moisturizer on them.&lt;br /&gt;From the slimy feel from the moisturizer, I accidently cut my legs and was not to happy about my first use.</li>
    <li> Had no problems with the refill blades! Very easy to replace.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Venus Gillette I was able to try this product for free. I absolutely love the cartridges. I have very dry stubborn skin and these worked great for me without any additional shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is beautiful and my legs never felt dry afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con in my opinion is how quickly the soap bars on the cartridge fade. Other than that the product is an A+</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette I was able to try this product for free if I gave my honest opinion of the product. I loved it just wish the moisture bar lasted longer. You can always use shaving cream which I did whe the moisture bar runs out but I wish I didn&#x27;t have to. Really loved it other than this.</li>
    <li> not what i expected leaves razor burn on my legs and i have some sensitive skin i received this product as part of a promotion from the brand</li>
    <li> I received the Venus &amp; Olay razor to try from Gillette Venus. I really like how smooth the razor was. The five blades make shaving faster and easier.</li>
    <li> These are one of my favorite Venus refills available. They eliminate the need for shaving cream while providing a smooth, even shave. I have sensitive underarms, and these are one of the only razors that offer great hair removal (due to the FIVE blades) without irritating my skin. I was able to test these thanks to a free product from Gillette Venus, but definitely plan to continue using them, especially for the summertime!</li>
    <li> I love these razors !! No need to use shaving cream ; the bars last quite a while . I change me razor weekly. And I shave everyday !</li>
    <li> Favorite brand of razors ever.  Super smooth.</li>
    <li> The razor itself is amazing. The refill packs will definitely come in handy to use the product longer.</li>
    <li> I was provided one of these Venus &amp; Olay razors to test out via a program run by Venus. The five blade razor shaved the same width as my regular razor, however the blades seemed spaced closer together. The razor rinsed out easily, that along with no need for shaving cream makes for a quick shave for this razor. My favorite application of it is to shave my armpits in the sink when there is just no time to hop in the shower. It&#x27;s also wonderful for shaving legs what ever the senario. I never had a problem with razor rash using this, which is typically a bit off an issue for me. The shave gel bars were a bit bulky at first, so the first few times I ever used it, I did have trouble with my bikini line, just getting the razor where I needed it was a little awkward so I ended up going back per the same areas with old razor. Still no shaving cream was needed then! The built in shave gel bars come off thick when the razor is fresh. I also noticed that I did not get as close of a shave as I am accostomed to using what I consider regular pressure, because of the way they razor slid atop the thick layer of shave gel. After using it a few different times that was no longer an issue. I had to get used to a different feel of the razor in my hand, change my technique a little, and the shave gel did not come off quite as think after the first few uses. After many uses the shave gel bars are almost gone. Now that they are thin and don&#x27;t touch as great an are of my skin I think I will continue to use the razor for a bit as a normal razor with my regular shaving cream as the blades are still sharp and not yet needing to he replaced. Other people might not run in to this senario, I feel tht I rinsed off a lot of the gel bars just rinsing my hair out of the razor, however I have very thick hair. Overall this has given me the best shave experience, no razor burn, no need for additional shaving cream, less overall time spent shaving with this! The vanilla creme scent was hardly noticeableto me, so I can definitely say it was not over powering or unpleasant.</li>
    <li> These little cartridges are a life saver if you are a lover of convenience. You don&#x27;t have to use messy shaving cream to get a smooth shave. They leave your skin feeling soft. They don&#x27;t irritate your skin at all or leave any cuts. The 5 blades don&#x27;t leave any hair behind in one smooth motion. Thats what i love so much about these. I had the privilege to try these out for free thanks to Gillette Venus.  That being said they are also some cons. The moisture bar that acts as shaving cream does disappear fast and the design is a little flimsy. But don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying these. If you are looking for convenience I&#x27;d say this is the right razors for you!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It gives a very close shave and it&#x27;s not as irritating. I will be buying more of the refills and I will be spreading the word to my friends and family. I was given the razor free for testing and review purposes by Gillette Venus and I&#x27;m glad they did.</li>
    <li> Great razor i love it! My legs are smooth and silky, but it&#x27;s only two things that disappoint me. 1. The soap bars leave too quickly. 2. They gave me a hook, but it keeps falling. But overall it&#x27;s great razor.</li>
    <li> Love love love these blades! Very close shave and very moisturizing as well! No need to use shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand but they are honestly the best razors ive ever used. No in grown hairs. No bumps or anything and i have SUPER sensitive skin. I would DEFINITELY buy them regularly</li>
    <li> These blades are so worth it!  They leave your skin very extra super soft!  I highly recommend this for all you ladies out there!  It&#x27;s very affordable and it really lives up to its name!  Trust me!</li>
    <li> I really LOVE this feeling of these blades!! The razor left my legs feeling smooth and not prickly for a long time! I will continue buying these blades for a while!</li>
    <li> I love my razor. No soap or shaving cream  required. It&#x27;s great a must try!</li>
    <li> This razor started out really nice. The fact that I received this razor for free through a program run by Venus was especially nice. When I first took it out of the package I wondered how it would work. The shape is a little weird, and the head is bigger than other razors. But it’s still very lightweight.When I began to use the razor I immediately loved it..I was hooked for the first few days, but then I started noticing how fast my hair grew back. I think that the razor is too small and doesn&#x27;t cut my hair deep enough. The main reason I loved this razor was because I didn&#x27;t have to use any shaving cream. The moisture bars really were making my skin softer than I have experienced with other razors!The shower suction hook is a good idea but for some reason wouldn’t stay on my shower wall.This razor is overall amazing and I would recommend it! It’s a great product!! (Kendiesweet143)</li>
    <li> I like that Venus and Olay have come together to create an amazing razor for a close shave. You get the best of both worlds-the close shave of Gillette and the moisturizing comfort of Olay. The only problem I have with these cartridges is that they are a bit expensive- but I truly believe they are worth the price. I didn&#x27;t recieve any nicks or cuts during my shave which is a huge plus for me! Not to mention these cartridges smell awesome, vanilla goodness! (I tried this product for free thanks to Gillette Venus).</li>
    <li> I got to try out the razor thanks to a program Venus ran. The cartridges are great because they have 5 blades and they give a nice, close shave. My skin doesn&#x27;t dry out after I shave the only downside is that the moisturizing strips dissolve a little faster than I expected. Other than that, I will be looking to buy more cartridges.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is light weight and very easy yo use. The blades are awesome I got a very close shave in one go round. The fragrance and moisturizer is great also. I didn&#x27;t have to use a soap or cream to shave. I didn&#x27;t put on lotion in my pubic area either . this razor made my skin feel very smooth .</li>
    <li> This has been my go-to razor since the pink daisies. I&#x27;ve switched back and forth when others have been on sale from time to time, but I quit doing that after I realized it wasn&#x27;t worth it. I never cut myself and my skin always feels so soft after. The smell is so nice, too! It&#x27;s almost like a sun lotion smell. Definitely don&#x27;t leave it where it is soaking wet all the time, it can get gooey and leave messes.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price vs. the stores. My wife loves these...</li>
    <li> Love these razors. They have &amp;#34;moisture bars&amp;#34; so you don&#x27;t need to use shave cream. The moisture bars are very creamy and provide a nice smooth shave, along with the five blades! No nicks or cuts ever. Last for about 4 uses when shaving full leg and underarms. After that you can still use it, but not as much moisture bar left, so shave isn&#x27;t as smooth.</li>
    <li> I recently got to try this product for free thanks to Gillette Venus and I love it. Before this was sent to me I used the Venus for sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and I can say the same for this one. Venus with Olay kept my skin soft and I would recommend this razor</li>
    <li> These razor refills are amazing! I love that you do not need shaving cream to shave.  It makes shaving so much easier and faster.  I have had the razor since early June, so over a month and the cartridge is still good.  I received the razor from an outside source for Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> I was able to recieve this product for free thanks to Gillette Venus. Personally, I loved this razor. I am a person who loads up on shaving cream most of the time. I hate having Razor burn! I dont want to be in pain if I can prevent it! And with this with the moisture strips, I didnt even need to use shaving cream. And I didnt get ANY razor burn! My legs were as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt! The moisture tabs didnt dissolve too fast either! I used it for at least two weeks shaving every day! The blades also lasted pretty well durig that time! I got a super close shave. Another thing was that it smelled amazing!  The razor is a really pretty gold and white. I will be repurchasing these cartriges!</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Venus &amp; Olay razor complimentary of Gillette Veuns and I am very thankful for the opportunity. It was a close shave and it left my legs feeling smooth and moisturized. The moisture pads do run out very quickly, I noticed I changed mine every couple weeks, as I shaved every other day. Overall, this is a great razor that I will continue to use and would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These razors are amazing! The Olay bar gels help moisturize and keep your legs silky soft. The 5 blades help give that super close shave which make your legs feel amazingly soft! Highly recommend these razors! They also smell heavenly! I want to thank Gillette Venus for allowing me to try out this product however that does not change my overall experience on this product.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this razor blade. This is super moistening while shaving. Trying the product for free thanks to Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> I love my venus razor,  prefer the 5 blades</li>
    <li> These do not last long.</li>
    <li> The moisture tab dissolves pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> No razor burn and my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> great for the skin and leaves legs flawless</li>
    <li> I always shave with baby oil for smooth damage free legs but I  used this razor with about three days growth and didn&#x27;t use  shaving cream or oil . No razor  burn or bumps  yet.  I have eczema  and sensitive skin so I need moisture in my products. This is a great razor for me and I&#x27;m super happy to  have tried it thanks to a program run by Venus . I can&#x27;t say the design is any different from other razors like it but the Olay  formula is great. Make sure to wet your legs and the blade so you don&#x27;t damage your skin.</li>
    <li> I like these cartilages I was lucky enough to be able to test these cartilages through a Venus run program.The cartilage is easy to take on and off. The shave bars also work really well they glide of skin smoothly with no snags. Overall they are really nice but the price isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great blades. I love how easy it is to get a close shave. Leaves you feeling silky smooth and smells great too. I did try the product for free thanks to gillette and venus and I will be repurchasing. I can&#x27;t think of anything that I dislike about these blades. They are wonderful.</li>
    <li> I received a free product from Gillette Venus to try, opinion is of my own. I really like the shave gel bar. One thing I dread about shaving is the hassle of shaving cream. Luckily the shave gel bar eliminates the use of shaving cream, so I can worry less. After one shave my legs were left silky, smooth and smelled so good thanks to the nice vanilla scent the bar has. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I tried out the Venus Olay Razor through one of their programs. I must admit I loved the fact that I didnt have to use shaving cream. I have used other shavers where shaving cream wasn&#x27;t necessary, but always had Knicks and cuts. That was not the case with the Venus Olay Shaver! I would also recommend this for bikini line shaves, smooth shave without the bumps!</li>
    <li> The moisturizing bars lived up to the claims, I didn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream/gel during or lotion after (which I don&#x27;t think I have had either happen before). I also know from a former room-mate that the moisturizing bars will fall off before they are fully used up. They are a bit on the pricey side, but are very easy to use and I think if you don&#x27;t want to haul around shaving cream on vacation or have it clutter up your shower this is worth the buy.</li>
    <li> The Olay bars on the razors make it so easy to shave, my skin never gets irritated and i don&#x27;t even have to use soap or shaving cream. After I shave my legs feel so soft its amazing! I can go 3 almost 4 days without feeling my hair on my legs! Highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I personally love it because doesn&#x27;t leave you with any burns,bumps or dryness...yes they might be expensive, but totally worth it if you want a smoother skin and/or sensitive skin...Love that you don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream the Olay Moisture Bars do the job by itself..I&#x27;ve used this a few weeks now and  Im trying this product for free thanks to Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used so far, they glide on so smoothly it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re shaving! And for someone like me who cuts themself every time I shave due to dull razor blades, it&#x27;s refreshing!!!</li>
    <li> I received this type of blade in a Venus campaign from bzzagent. I love to try new products and this one was great! I loved the fact that it makes shaving quicker and easier without the hassle of shaving cream! The Olay bars really work and you don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream at all. I have very sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t irritate me at all either which was great. Made my legs feel super silky and soft. I have always been a Venus user but typically shy away from blades with shave gel bars. However I am so glad I tried this one! The only downside that I found at all is that it is not quite as close of a shave like I get with my traditional Venus razor. But it was quick and easy which was great! Overall I loved this product and would definitely recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> These razor blades were very nice and lasted FOREVER!  The moisturizing bars were great and prevented all irritation.  I wish this came in other scents, the vanilla was nice but I wish you could change it up.  I wish there was a way to make the moisture bars last longer.  I feel that the blades last much longer the the moisturizing bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Gillette Venus I got to try this product for free!</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion and I will definitely be purchasing it again! This is a great razor! I always get red bumps when I shave and it irritates my skin but not with this razor! I can flaunt my beautiful legs right after i shave cause they&#x27;re bump free! and so soft! also the scent of the razor is amazing :)</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing!! I was provided a sample of this razor as a program run by Venus. I was amazed at how great this razor worked! I am very skeptical of &amp;#34;hydrating razors&amp;#34; because they often don&#x27;t hydrate and leave a waxy layer on your skin. I was pleasantly surprised that this razor didn&#x27;t leave a waxy finish at all. the hydrating bar did not last as long as I would hope it would, but while it did, it left my skin much smoother and softer than my normal razor leaves me. I definitely think it is better than my usual razor and I will likely repurchase this.</li>
    <li> Venus &amp; Olay made a great razor.  There are a few pros, and a few cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No shave cream needed&lt;br /&gt;Five blades&lt;br /&gt;Smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Price $$&lt;br /&gt;Needs proper care (hanging on hook, not in a wet place)&lt;br /&gt;Awkward size due to bars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this razor was that the moisture bars really did help make the skin more smooth and moisturized.  After a shave, my legs usually feel dry, however this razor completely eliminated this problem.  Not only did they feel smooth and soft, but I didn&#x27;t feel the need to use a lotion post shave either.  This razor definitely needs to be hung on the shower hook that is supplied with the razor, or else the bars will erode quickly with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor blade is extremely easy to attach.  The packaging on the cartridge has grippy plastic, allowing it to be opened with wet hands.  It is also nice that this razor can be attached to various Gillette cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest downfall in my perspective is the price.  If you want a good razor, I would recommend this one! Thanks to Gillette Venus for giving me the opportunity to try this product for free.</li>
    <li> good price for the a great product</li>
    <li> I am a guy that has tattoos and like to show them off that&#x27;s why I buy these and they work great for arms!</li>
    <li> Although it is a little bit pricey I think it is definitely worth it, This the only razor that my legs actually feel smooth and moisturized when I am done. Gillette Venus proved me with the opportunity to try this razor out for free, and I won&#x27;t go back to any other razor now! I recommend this razor to anyone who has dry skin and a hard time getting a close shave!</li>
    <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t dry out as much after shaving my legs. I like that feeling. I noticed that moisture bar part has gotten smaller since they first came out. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this razor! The Olay moisture bars are genius! They make your skin feel silky smooth and soft! My legs haven&#x27;t felt this hydrated in a long time. Adding the lotion afterward is the icing on the cake, your arms and legs literally feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom. I am so happy that I received these items free from Gillette as a part of their promotion. These are a must try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully since 2012 and will continue to repurchase these blades. I have very sensitive skin and the moisture bars have helped minimize that after shave irritation and burn. I also LOVE how close of a shave I get. In the past I had to shave my legs twice to assure that I got every hair, not with this! With the Olay Venus razor blades one swipe in each leg suffices and leaves my skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I have used this in my bikini area with no issues as well. But I have to be honest, there is one negative aspect to it - the moisture bars become noticeably smaller after the 3rd or 4th use. When the moisture bars are smaller - it no longer touches your skin. I also had the incident where the moisture bar just completely fell off my razor. Overall the pros do outweigh the cons. My legs are so soft that my 4 year old niece purposely approaches me to rub them lol. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My favorite razors. I get 5-6 good, close shaves out of each, without irritation.</li>
    <li> Wife loves these blades.  It&#x27;s the Olay!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not brand loyal to many brands. But the Venus brand razors and refills are something that are worth paying the premium price for. Everytime I try a different brand, I regret not purchasing the Venus brand. Venus is the only brand that doesn&#x27;t rust in my shower and the lubricating strip actually lasts. This is not only my brand for shaving my legs, but my husband prefers this for shaving his face.</li>
    <li> I was able to receive this product for free to test out thanks to Gillette Venus and I can honestly say these are the best razor blades ever. The razor is nothing without the blades, and these blades are sharp enough to shave and leave you hairless while at the same time make it so you never accidentally prick yourself.  The multiple blades and the Olay lather bars on both sides do make it a smoother and more comfortable shave, which is what I&#x27;m talking about!</li>
    <li> Generally I try to stay away from women&#x27;s razors, they just never seem to compare to the blades found in men&#x27;s. When receiving the Venus &amp; Olay razor through a Venus promotion I was skeptical, but I have to say I am impressed! The blades made for an extremely close shave in comparison to other razors I have tried, and the moisture bars made it so that I didn&#x27;t have to use any shaving cream!! (Amazing I know). Even without shaving cream my skin is soft smooth, and free of cuts, bumps, and burns of any kind. The reason that I had to give this a 3 star though was that the moisture bars give off a weird smell and that it looks like these bars aren&#x27;t going to last very long if I keep using the razor everyday.</li>
    <li> its is such a great razor thxx to Gillette Venus and Bzzagent for sending me this razor it is so good it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you shaving it just feels smooth .And afterwards it makes you ski so soft it like a baby&#x27;s bottom and you legs look beautiful ,Another thing i like about it that you don&#x27;t even need shaving cream just shaving the shower and that&#x27;s it. I recommend everyone to buy this razor asap .its so good some people think they are over priced but i think there the right price because they make your skin so soft and your husband or boyfriend will love touching you when your so soft but it now .</li>
    <li> Thanks to a program through Gillette Venus, I was able to try Gillette&#x27;s new Venus &amp; Olay razor in VanillaCrème scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about these cartridges were the amazing flexibility, even before using it. The razor was extremely smooth with every stroke, and I didn&#x27;t even get one cut! Whenever I&#x27;m using a new razor, I tend to get at least a couple cuts around my knees. But with this razor, nothing! Although I used the razor as directed (without shaving cream) the first time, I found that I personally need to use shaving cream when shaving my underarms. So if you have sensitive underarms, beware! You still need a bit of shaving cream for protection. The moisture bars are just not enough to protect my sensitive skin. The razor did great without shaving cream on my legs though - they feel smooth and moisturized after every shave. No nicks, bumps, or razor burn. These are great cartridges, I would definitely recommend it especially due to the flexibility of the moisture strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: It seems as though the moisture bars will be used far before I&#x27;m done with the razor. Maybe I use razors longer than I should. Who knows, we&#x27;ll see just how long the cartridges last!</li>
    <li> I really love this razor. The cartridges are a little bit expensive but i did receive this for free to review from Gillette Venus. It makes my legs so super smooth and it think even though its expensive its totally worth it because of the smooth shave you get and you don&#x27;t even need shaving cream!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Olay and Venus! These blades are good! I wasn&#x27;t totally blown away as it was hard to get such a close shave because of how thick the moisturizing bar on them was.  However, what the razor lacks in closeness it makes up for in making my legs feel soft! Overall, these cartridges provided a good shave and made my legs look and feel good! They are easy to pop on to the handle and don&#x27;t fall off or come undone as I&#x27;ve experience with other razors, they stay in place well.  I would recommend these to friends and family!</li>
    <li> These razors are great! You can tell how sharp they are and how well they work simply on how smooth your skin is after use. My skin feels great thanks to this razor and the added bonus of the Olay gel bars. The razor and gel bars go hand &amp; hand and work well together. The only problem I can see is possibly the bars deteriorating faster than the blades getting dull. And if that&#x27;s a concern, I suggest storing them away from any place that may get wet. Overall, a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product for free thanks to Gillette Venus</li>
    <li> The best Venus Razor Blades! I am loving these razor blades. Not only do they smell amazing they give you such a soft close shave and leave your skin feeling so moisturized. Did I mention the amazing VanillaCreme Scent? Once you open the package the scent is so soothing and gel shave bars assist in a close shave and doesn&#x27;t leave a film behind. I was sent this product from a campaign run by Venus. I totally recommend these razor blades if you are looking to set up your shaving game.</li>
    <li> I did receive this product from Gillette Venus for review, and I was not impressed at all. The bars had a very drying effect on my legs, and the bars disappeared only after 2 uses. In my honest opinion is not worth the price. The blades also gave me pretty rough razor burn on softer skin, and did not get down to the skin. I ended up with stubble after the shave. I was not happy with this product in the least. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend someone to purchase this unless you still want some stubble left on your legs after a careful shave.</li>
    <li> It is a very smooth shave.  They are worth every penny.  I also love the added moisture bars around the top and bottom of the head of the razor. It is a great product and a great company.  I got mine from a program through Venus. They are the best razors I have ever encountered and I highly recommend them to each and every consumer and user. All the others seem to leave my skin feeling rough and dry and I hate that feeling.  These razor/cartridges have changed the feeling of all that.</li>
    <li> I was givin the opportunity to try out the Venus &amp; Olay razor thanks to Gillette Venus. The razor itself was great the first few times of shaving, but I felt the need to use shaving cream after that. The refills are a little pricey but not too bad. Overall they are good razors.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving as it irritates my skin, but I hate being hairy even more!  :)  Alas, it is a necessary evil.  I thought you just had to put up with the skin irritation when you shave.  I bought this on a whim and am glad that I did!  It really cuts down on the irritation.  You get a close shave without the bumps or irritation.  If the moisturizing strip is reduced by 50%, replace it or else you won&#x27;t get the same level of lubrication and your skin will be irritated. Best blades I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Big floppy shaving blade. Bizarre.  Results in an uneven shave. These are terrible and the rubber like Olay &#x27;bumpers&#x27; disintegrate.  I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! The scent is great and it left my skin silky and smooth! It made the need for shaving cream unneeded and the time it takes to shave shorter. I was given this sample by Venus to try with my reveiw given honestly.</li>
    <li> these are great. no shaving cream needed</li>
    <li> I received this razor and a refill cartridge via a program ran by Venus! Love these razor refills ! The only downside is the price! The smell and feel of your legs after using this is amazing! I&#x27;d definitely recommend !</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. I found that the blades worked well for my sensitive skin and left me feeling smooth without the need to moisturize separately. I think that shaving is a neceessary evil and it was great to have this product handy!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;The vanilla scent of the moisture bars is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use shaving cream, the skin remains smooth and moist. They don&#x27;t irritate your skin at all or leave any cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the 5 blades on the razor, you get a really close shave without much effort.&lt;br /&gt;The moisture bars don&#x27;t melt away too soon, I&#x27;ve been using one for up to 1,5 month (shaving underarms daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit pricey, but I feel that not having to buy shaving cream, balances out the price difference.</li>
    <li> Best blades ever made for woman...</li>
