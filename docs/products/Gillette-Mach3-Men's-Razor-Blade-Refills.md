      <li>Great.  </li>

      <li>The package is good and is in perfects conditions</li>
      <li>Loved that I can order these and get them shipped to</li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>MEN&#x27;S RAZOR BLADE REFILLS are excellent blades as they shave close and leave your face smooth and intact.  </li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>I was very glad to find these blades.</li>
      <li>It effectively removes hair from my face.</li>
      <li>Additionally, these particular blades, the &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; Mach 3 with lubricant, are the best of the bunch.  </li>
      <li>Nice clean shave without the irritation!</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly!!</li>
      <li>It seems the 4th blade adds more surface area (and irritation) vs. the 3 thicker blades for the Mach 3.  </li>
      <li>The offer made it a worthwhile purchase for 19$.</li>
      <li>However, since I&#x27;m buying them for comfort, so I suppose it&#x27;s ok to sacrifice longevity.</li>
      <li>Too many words required for this review.  </li>
      <li>like on a magic carpet.  </li>
      <li>I am giving four stars only because the price is not the best.</li>
      <li>I prefer Gillette mach 3 turbo but these are pretty good for the money</li>
      <li>Good shave way to high in price!@!</li>
      <li>Good deal and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Very smooth and good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I need a great blade because I shave my head and face daily.</li>
      <li>I can tell a significant difference.</li>
      <li>With some products, generics are just as good, but it seems P&amp;G does in fact have better blades vs. competitors, with the Mach 3 sensitive being my personal favorite.</li>
      <li>I am more than willing to shave more frequently to avoid having my face break</li>
      <li>Ship quickly.</li>
      <li>The blades are pricey, but worth it.  </li>
      <li>The Mach III does just fine on its own that it doesn&#x27;t need these other gimmicks</li>
      <li>I average 1 really good, super close, 3 pass shave per blade, and still have the chops to shave under the arms before changing them out.</li>
      <li>Best shave I&#x27;ve had using a Gillette blade, only negative I have is that the blades lose their sharpness fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>These blades are noticeably more gentle on my face than the standard blades.</li>
      <li>He says these are the only blades that really work for him so glad to help.</li>
      <li>Better than the Mach 3 turbo by a long shot.</li>
      <li>Little pricey, but I enjoy the comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>Thanks...</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>so I am real happy with these that last a long time and the sensitive type work better than the regular ones, at least for me anyway.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time for shaves as comfortable as the ones I get from these blades.</li>
      <li>Blades are sharp and easy on skin.  </li>
      <li>The sensitive cartridges seem to get a very close shave for me.</li>
      <li>Love them,close shave with little irritation,good for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>2nd time buying M3 sensitive style cartridges well worth the price</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s worth spending the extra money for these.  </li>
      <li>I could not find this particular blade near me......</li>
      <li>I even tried dollar shave club&#x27;s razors, and none of them worked as well on my skin as the Mach 3 with sensitive blades.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin but for me, it turns out it wasn&#x27;t any of the razors bothering my skin, but</li>
      <li>Ten pack is unusual.</li>
      <li>I have wire for whiskers and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>sensitive POWER</li>
      <li>He generally hates shaving because his face breaks out.  </li>
      <li>Shaves very cleans and blades last a long time.</li>
      <li>I have normal facial hair (not too thick but could grow a beard if so desired) but with sensitive skin/fair complexion, which easily becomes irritated (with razor burn) due to wearing business attire every day.  </li>
      <li>No idea if they are knockoffs or re-packs, but they&#x27;re within my budget; so long as I can keep the PRIME alive!</li>
      <li>No more red dots, get the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin shaving cream - it&#x27;s more like a creamy oil and a little goes a long way too!</li>

<li> And the first one at least lasted for several weeks.</li>
<li> Decent price, predictable quality</li>
<li> There is not really a good way to rate this item other than it works fine.</li>
<li> They felt dull and after the first shave they were done.</li>
<li> They also last fairly long</li>
<li> Additionally, I find that I can use a single Mach 3 cartridge for two weeks without having to replace it (vs. 1 week tops for dollar shave club).  </li>
<li> College students don&#x27;t have a lot of extra money for expensive items like this, so he appreciates it very much.</li>
<li> Works very well; I have a tough beard and get about 2 weeks per blade.</li>
<li> The main negative is that they seem to wear out a little quicker.</li>
<li> His review of this product was &amp;#34;it does not cut quite as close as other razors</li>
<li> They&#x27;re a little expensive, but worth it.</li>
<li> I can usually get 4 shaves out of a single blade</li>
<li> Their life is about 20% less though.</li>
<li> however I wish it was a little cheaper.....</li>
<li> price is a little steep.</li>
<li> Cartridges are not cheap no matter where you purchase them</li>
<li> but these were bad right out of the packet.</li>
<li> I usually cut myself a bit when I shave sometimes, almost done with this box and didn&#x27;t cut myself once.</li>
<li> For anything to have gone up in price like Gillette razor blades, it is truly a shame that the technology is so poor.  </li>
<li> Too expensive, but I still use gillette.</li>
<li> - do yourself a favor and change the lousy shaving gel or cream you are using instead!</li>
<li> Very disappointed in the life of the blades.......</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product meets my expectations to the fullest however I wish it was a little cheaper.....let me know when Amazon has it on sale.</li>
    <li> I prefer Gillette mach 3 turbo but these are pretty good for the money</li>
    <li> Shaves very cleans and blades last a long time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Item was as identified and no issues with the product.</li>
    <li> I have normal facial hair (not too thick but could grow a beard if so desired) but with sensitive skin/fair complexion, which easily becomes irritated (with razor burn) due to wearing business attire every day.  I have tested various razors and have found that the Mach 3 is actually easier on my skin than the Fusion 4 razors - even though the latter are more expensive and advertised as Gillette&#x27;s smoothest razors.  It seems the 4th blade adds more surface area (and irritation) vs. the 3 thicker blades for the Mach 3.  Additionally, these particular blades, the &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; Mach 3 with lubricant, are the best of the bunch.  I even tried dollar shave club&#x27;s razors, and none of them worked as well on my skin as the Mach 3 with sensitive blades.  Additionally, I find that I can use a single Mach 3 cartridge for two weeks without having to replace it (vs. 1 week tops for dollar shave club).  With some products, generics are just as good, but it seems P&amp;G does in fact have better blades vs. competitors, with the Mach 3 sensitive being my personal favorite.</li>
    <li> Too expensive, but I still use gillette.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the life of the blades.......two good shaves maximum.  For anything to have gone up in price like Gillette razor blades, it is truly a shame that the technology is so poor.  Definitely leaves one thinking of rip offs.</li>
    <li> Decent price, predictable quality</li>
    <li> It effectively removes hair from my face. 5 stars for not failing</li>
    <li> Blades are sharp and easy on skin.  Too many words required for this review.  I&#x27;m done.  There is not really a good way to rate this item other than it works fine.</li>
    <li> These blades are the best (for me).  I only order these blades.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised what else can you say about a razor blade</li>
    <li> I can usually get 4 shaves out of a single blade but these were bad right out of the packet. They felt dull and after the first shave they were done. Definitely would not buy these again!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my husband.  He generally hates shaving because his face breaks out.  His review of this product was &amp;#34;it does not cut quite as close as other razors but my face does NOT break out.  I am more than willing to shave more frequently to avoid having my face break out.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con we have is the price.</li>
    <li> Seem to have a couple of defective blades in this pack.</li>
    <li> Good shave way to high in price!@!</li>
    <li> Works very well; I have a tough beard and get about 2 weeks per blade.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Ten pack is unusual. Good price.</li>
    <li> The sensitive cartridges seem to get a very close shave for me. The main negative is that they seem to wear out a little quicker.</li>
    <li> These blades are noticeably more gentle on my face than the standard blades. Their life is about 20% less though. However, since I&#x27;m buying them for comfort, so I suppose it&#x27;s ok to sacrifice longevity.</li>
    <li> I was very glad to find these blades. Great product!! Shipped quickly!!</li>
    <li> I could not find this particular blade near me......but, as always....I found them on Amazon.  Pushed the button....and two or three days later...here they come... like on a magic carpet.  Thanks...</li>
    <li> Recently switched to this. Very smooth and good for sensitive skin. I usually cut myself a bit when I shave sometimes, almost done with this box and didn&#x27;t cut myself once.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time for shaves as comfortable as the ones I get from these blades. And the first one at least lasted for several weeks.</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; loves the sharpness when using these blades. I know use them too lol</li>
    <li> I like these razor blades. They give me a close shave. They also last fairly long They&#x27;re a little expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent by because the price is great.  I need a great blade because I shave my head and face daily. It works very well.</li>
    <li> Loved that I can order these and get them shipped to me.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t always see this style in the store if I remember that I am out.</li>
    <li> Love them,close shave with little irritation,good for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I have wire for whiskers and sensitive skin. Perfect blade for me.  The extra guards can get in the way though.</li>
    <li> Using it with Mach3 power razor and no complains.Amazon shipped it on time and product came as described.</li>
    <li> Overpriced, but they shave soooooo gooood.</li>
    <li> Cartridges are not cheap no matter where you purchase them so I am real happy with these that last a long time and the sensitive type work better than the regular ones, at least for me anyway.  Good deal and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Gillette&#x27;s MACH3 sensitive POWER MEN&#x27;S RAZOR BLADE REFILLS are excellent blades as they shave close and leave your face smooth and intact.  The blades are pricey, but worth it.  Definitely would recommend this item to my friends.</li>
    <li> Great.  Ship quickly. Savings</li>
    <li> LEAVE A SHAVED EXELENTE</li>
    <li> these work great. Better than the Mach 3 turbo by a long shot.</li>
    <li> 2nd time buying M3 sensitive style cartridges well worth the price</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had using a Gillette blade, only negative I have is that the blades lose their sharpness fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Little pricey, but I enjoy the comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor heads.....price is a little steep.</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave without the irritation!</li>
    <li> The offer made it a worthwhile purchase for 19$.</li>
    <li> I tried these and the Mach 3 turbo... They are just not necessary. The Mach III does just fine on its own that it doesn&#x27;t need these other gimmicks - do yourself a favor and change the lousy shaving gel or cream you are using instead! Get this to use with your Mach 3: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B003156NJI?pc_redir&#x3D;1396221812&amp;robot_redir&#x3D;1 I have sensitive skin but for me, it turns out it wasn&#x27;t any of the razors bothering my skin, but RATHER the Shaving GELS!! No more red dots, get the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin shaving cream - it&#x27;s more like a creamy oil and a little goes a long way too!</li>
    <li> My Wife is happy with this item, to care her skin. The package is good and is in perfects conditions</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had in a while.  I have regular Mach 3 blades that I&#x27;ve been buying for a while... If you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s worth spending the extra money for these.  I can tell a significant difference.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. I am giving four stars only because the price is not the best.</li>
    <li> I average 1 really good, super close, 3 pass shave per blade, and still have the chops to shave under the arms before changing them out. No idea if they are knockoffs or re-packs, but they&#x27;re within my budget; so long as I can keep the PRIME alive!</li>
    <li> Caught a great price so stock up. My grandson loves these blades so I slip him some every now and then to help out. College students don&#x27;t have a lot of extra money for expensive items like this, so he appreciates it very much. He says these are the only blades that really work for him so glad to help.</li>
