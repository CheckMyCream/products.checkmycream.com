      <li>I tried to find it for her; t hey don&#x27;t have it in the stores; most every one has not heard of it, so I got on line and found it.my daughter is station in Italy.</li>

      <li>We LOVE our epsom salt lotion after runs...</li>
      <li>I have been searching for the best relieve I can find for the constant pain in my legs associated with fibro, read about it, decided to give it a try!</li>

      <li>My Naprapath recommended lotion as a way to get more magnesium into my muscles and I will continue to use.</li>
      <li>OK</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS LOTION .</li>
      <li>When I was at the store to get some, I saw the lotion and got that instead figuring it would be more convenient.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered this on Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
      <li>My aches are quickly alleviated with this lotion.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and love that it&#x27;s NO FRAGRANCE.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s not too greasy, and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
      <li>Love the non-greasy yet smooth texture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m confirmed DMSO user, but this stuff, which isn&#x27;t even touted to be a pain reliever is better.</li>
      <li>Having Epsom salts in a cream makes it so easy to apply to the skin.</li>
      <li>The consistency is just fine for me.  </li>
      <li>I was super pleased with this lotion.  </li>
      <li>The lotion is non-scented and if you want to get creative you can add drops of your favorite scented oil such as lavender to be even more soothing!</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth but after it feels chalky and drying.</li>
      <li>I mixed it in with some eucerin and coconut oil to take to the massage therapist and it was great.  </li>
      <li>The idea is great, but the salt makes the lotion gritty.</li>
      <li>I like how smooth it makes your skin feel.</li>
      <li>hope Morton creates a non-paraben, chemical free version for people that prefer organic products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>It is okay, but I prefer the smell and results of Two Old Goats better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Great for achey body-parts, helps a sore back right away - &amp; sore feet or legs.</li>
      <li>I had an allergic reaction after using diphenhydramine cream and my right arm swelled up to twice its size!</li>
      <li>More like oil - very watery consistency - would not call it lotion</li>
      <li>I have only used it on my hands and feet and it feels so good.</li>
      <li>not bad smelling and not too greasy</li>
      <li>Excellent product with very little to no odor!</li>
      <li>and it works for mild aches and pains.</li>
      <li>Works great on so many different things, i.e. Fibromyalgia, Arthritis, back and hip pain, that I have also bought this lotion for my mother in law for her aches and pains.</li>
      <li>This is very good for sore muscles especially for those people who can&#x27;t soak in a tub with traditional epsom salts</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like tHe effect, it feels like cheap lotion</li>
      <li>An epsom salt bath is far better of soothing your muscles.</li>
      <li>when cvs discontinued it, many peripheral neuropathy patients were upset since it was one of the few lotions which was effective &amp; inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>But its worth it for the pain relief</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great idea for people who do not have or take baths; works well.</li>
    <li> when cvs discontinued it, many peripheral neuropathy patients were upset since it was one of the few lotions which was effective &amp; inexpensive.  but within a few months morton&#x27;s epsom lotion came to the rescue.  it helps soothe the burning pain of peripheral neuropathy much as a foot soak with epsom salts would.  this is an easier way to absorb magnesium.  it really works to calm painful feet.  thank you morton&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I severely hurt my ribs and this gave me relief.  Having Epsom salts in a cream makes it so easy to apply to the skin.</li>
    <li> This is very good for sore muscles especially for those people who can&#x27;t soak in a tub with traditional epsom salts</li>
    <li> I use this on my neighbor that has bone cancer and she said it helps with the pain tremendously.:)&lt;br /&gt;gotta keep this in stock</li>
    <li> When I first tried this it didn&#x27;t work. Second time I read the directions!  It works like a dream.  I massaged it into one sore spot on my foot.  That spot no longer hurts. The outer portion still does. Now I know it works so no more soaking my feet, yay.  Who has time for that?  Not me that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Would prefer this to exclude parabens and other known potential carcinogens....</li>
    <li> I notice that it helps a little with my legs at the end of the day but I will stick with Blue Emu instead.</li>
    <li> This is a great traveling size to carry along for those with minor pain. I tried it out a few times and was impressed.</li>
    <li> AWESOME helps so much</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to make my own magnesium oil lotion. I received it and it&#x27;s very liquid goes on well but gives me a sticky feeling on the surface of my skin. I really don&#x27;t like tHe effect, it feels like cheap lotion, I suspect it&#x27;s synthetic ingredients that are causing it. I&#x27;m going to go back to making magnesium oil creams and lotions. It&#x27;s very easy. I make magnesium oil or magnesium alcohol by adding boiling water to magnesium flakes or steeping them in alcohol...then adding to Shea butter or lotions or other stuff that you prefer your hand cream and body lotions to be made up of.  I don&#x27;t notice any pain relief you there unfortunately. I have a lot of pain in my hands and my back and my ankles and it hasn&#x27;t helped at all.</li>
    <li> When you can&#x27;t soak in Epsom Salts, this is the next best thing. I use this plus muscle soothing essential oils to keep leg cramps at bay.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on very greasy, but dries up completely in about 5 minutes.  It really does relieve the pain I have in some tendinitis in my knee and my stiff calves.  It takes about 10 minutes to work and lasts all day.  I have a friend that has Parkinsons disease and he has problems with severe muscle leg cramps.  I gave him a bottle and he says this has helped them better than any medication they have given him.  Epson Salts is essentially magnesium sulfate, and magnesium is well knows to help muscle cramps and tightness.  Magnesium supplements can help a lot too (especially with things like restless legs syndrome).</li>
    <li> This leaves a thick coating of salt and minerals on my feet.  My favorite use, though, is after I&#x27;ve put on regular lotion and my feet are still slippery, I put a layer of this on the soles of my feet and put my socks on for a minute or two.  Then when I take them off, my feet don&#x27;t slide around in my sandals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed it providing any help for swelling.</li>
    <li> This lotion helps to temporarily relieve pain and soreness as well as the CVS brand I used to use. The one downside is that this brand leaves dry white residue on your hands, where the other brand didn&#x27;t. If they could find a way to alleviate that, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
    <li> My massage therapist told me one of her clients used this and was raving about it.  So, having a lot of aches and pains with my fibromyalgia thought I would try it, saw some results, but not what I expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to bathe because of the pain and Fibromyalgia at times, and this stuff is easy to use and gives some relief to aching muscles and joints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had lots of lower back pain throughout my pregnancy, and this is easy to use and seems to help. I love that it&#x27;s not too greasy, and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
    <li> This lotion was as described.  I use it on areas that are painful and it helps to both moisturize and alleviate pain.  It glides on effortlessly and the effects last for several hours. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a product for years I have known about and thought it wasn&#x27;t for sale until I saw it at the store one day and picked up a bottle. It is soooo much easier to use the Epsom salt lotion than to lug bags of salt home and then dissolve into a bath. With this, you can rub it on anywhere that it hurts and it really relieves the ache! When I needed another bottle, the store was out and I knew Amazon would have it, so I ordered more! The lotion is non-scented and if you want to get creative you can add drops of your favorite scented oil such as lavender to be even more soothing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not smelly like the rubs that come in a tube and it works for mild aches and pains. Wish it was available in a tube though; would be handy to toss in my work bag. This product is nearly impossible to find in stores; good to get a stash from Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> It easier than soaking your  feet or whatever you need soaking.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I use this often on my back and knees due to pain from Fibromyalgia, in combination with my pain medication an it works. I am so glad I found this lotion!</li>
    <li> I use this every night for my neck and shoulders. I feel it helps.</li>
    <li> i rub it onto my legs @ bedtime and it helps with&lt;br /&gt;the leg cramps and i don&#x27;t have the pain that wakes&lt;br /&gt;me up from my sleep at night.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do all that much for my pain and it did leave a slight residue. But overall, I wasn&#x27;t dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> great product... helps pain</li>
    <li> great procuct...help!</li>
    <li> I am still trying this product to see if it seems to make a difference on how I feel.  &#x27;Tried it on my feet (since it is supposed to be equivalent to soaking in warm epsom salt water)...it leaves a white residue on my skin, so am trying to use a little less of the product at a time and let it soak in more.  I&#x27;m not fully convinced the product meets all its claims.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for aches and pains. I use all over, especially my lower back and it really helps.</li>
    <li> I like how smooth it makes your skin feel. I have only used it on my hands and feet and it feels so good. I have not used it on sore muscles yet...however...as soon as I get some sore muscles I will give it a try and update my review.</li>
    <li> Use this for your aches and pains!  I don&#x27;t feel any type of tingling sensation when applied, I just feel better afterwards.  Pain seems to go away more each time used.  If you don&#x27;t have time to soak in the tub with Epsom Salts this lotion will get you the same results.</li>
    <li> Great for bad feet love it !</li>
    <li> Leaves salt streaks on skin</li>
    <li> I like the results and the price is right, easier to use than other formulas. only drawback: does contain silicones.</li>
    <li> my daughter is in the military  and she ask me about it .And  I tried to find it for her; t hey don&#x27;t have it in the stores; most every one has not heard of it, so I got on line and found it.my daughter is station in Italy. so I thank you so much. I will be ordering this for her again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for minor injuries too. Also use everyday to help ease arthritis pain.</li>
    <li> I received my 7 Morton Epson salt lotion,  or should I say,  what was left of the poorly package bottles.  There was lotion everywhere. I am so DISAPPOINTED! Someone should have taken a little care in packaging. This was a gift for my friend&#x27;s 88 yr old mom. Now,  it&#x27;s just a big disappointment. How can we fix this.</li>
    <li> Love the non-greasy yet smooth texture. My aches are quickly alleviated with this lotion.</li>
    <li> I take Epsom Salt baths and was hoping that this lotion might be helpful also but it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I think this product is great for muscular aches when soaking in a tub of Epsom salts is not convenient. Also works great on nighttime leg cramps.</li>
    <li> This has been wonderful for easing arthritic and sciatic pain.  I was disappointed to see that they are no longer selling it at Walgreen&#x27;s and that I purchased one of the last bottles on Amazon.  This is a product that needs to be kept on the market.  It&#x27;s a good healer. Easy to use and love that it&#x27;s NO FRAGRANCE.</li>
    <li> Am an advocate of the benefits of using epsom salts and was happy this product was made available in lotion form.</li>
    <li> Works great. Not too chalky or greasy and doesnt have any weird smells to it. My lil one uses it at night especially after she has been to practice or been playing hard.</li>
    <li> Great choice for my ffibromylagia , helps with pain in legs and feet and arms, very good product .</li>
    <li> This lotion really works for all the muscle aches</li>
    <li> Purchase to help with fibromyalgia tender points. The idea is great, but the salt makes the lotion gritty. Didn&#x27;t care to have it rubbed on my back, but the product delivers as promised.</li>
    <li> omg. this stuff is a God Send! We LOVE our epsom salt lotion after runs...so convenient on the go too! not bad smelling and not too greasy</li>
    <li> No Quick  Fix - however, comforting and smoothing fer sure</li>
    <li> The seal was broken upon arrival, and the lotion leaked into the box a bit!&lt;br /&gt;I give thanks</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have multiple allergies and it is soooo difficult to find lotions without nut/seed oils or extracts in them.  I mixed it in with some eucerin and coconut oil to take to the massage therapist and it was great.  I&#x27;ve also used it on its own and it brings great temporary pain relief.  More than any of the biofreeze type stuff Ive used.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Wonderful for neuropathic pain.</li>
    <li> Daughter got this for her husband when he sprained his elbow at work.. I have lupus and my one knee gives me lot of trouble.. rubbing this in AM when I get up and then couple times a day helps a lot and cuts back on the meds for the pain and swelling.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff for his achy knees and ankles.  It really works to help reduce his pain.</li>
    <li> I have a severe all over body itching response after using this. It goes on smooth but after it feels chalky and drying. And like another person said it leaves a white residue. I itch for days after using this. I am sad because I really wanted this to work for me. I have tried it four times, a week or two apart each time to try and narrow down to this and it definitely is this lotion. I&#x27;m happy to see it works for others but for me I must be allergic or intolerant of it. I wonder if anyone else has experienced this problem.</li>
    <li> I was surprisingly pleased with this odorless, lightweight and creamy lotion.  I expected to have it leave my skin rather dry, but to the contrary, it leaves skin soft and without any perceptible residue.  The Subscribe and Save program helps to make this a very good value/</li>
    <li> This review is for the bottle of lotion, not the bags of salt. I read about someone using Epsom salts in a paste for their Rosacea. When I was at the store to get some, I saw the lotion and got that instead figuring it would be more convenient. I believe the sulfur content and its anti-inflammatory properties is what works on Rosacea. This works really well for keeping my face pink, instead of blotchy red.  I had a flare up the other day to due to drinking an alcoholic drink and being outside in hot weather. My cheeks got red, hot and blotchy. I went inside and applied the Epsom lotion. Within a minute, my face was mildly pink and calm. Truly impressive. I use it now once or twice a day, a small amount, and just on my cheeks and nose. It can be a little drying or leave a slight salty residue. That&#x27;s a small price to pay for me not to have a hot, red face. I put some in a small empty bottle that will fit in a purse for flare ups away from home. It is a little runny, you have to shake the bottle well before each use. I hope this continues to work for me!</li>
    <li> Excellent product with very little to no odor!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! It dried up my terrible poison ivy blisters better than anything else I tried..and I tried A LOT from homeopathic remedies to OTC creams. I had an allergic reaction after using diphenhydramine cream and my right arm swelled up to twice its size! Horrible! This lotion helped so much. I saw significant improvement in just one day..my arm&#x27;s swelling went down and the blisters were drying up and far less itchy! This is one product that I will never be without now that I know how well it works.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for the best relieve I can find for the constant pain in my legs associated with fibro, read about it, decided to give it a try! It really helps, when done after a hot epsom salt soak in the tub, ahhh, great relieve, I&#x27;m able to sleep.</li>
    <li> I exercise a lot. When I don&#x27;t have time to soak in an Epsom salt bath, I use this lotion.</li>
    <li> Use it every night before bed for Joint Pain and it helps. I will always have a bottle in hand.</li>
    <li> Works great on mosquito bites! Put it on for relief each time they itch...they will be gone quicker than just left on their own.</li>
    <li> the ladies at work were talking about this and I had aches and pains and carpal tunnel and thought I would try it - not super but worth buying and using regularly especially if you massage in slowly</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT EVER!!!! I put it on my wrists and thumbs when they were really sore and it stopped that pain. Then I began using it liberally for anyplace that had pain and never saw anything work like this. I&#x27;m confirmed DMSO user, but this stuff, which isn&#x27;t even touted to be a pain reliever is better. The combination of the two is miraculous.  Apparently your body absorbs it very well and it goes right to work on relieving the discomfort of inflammation. I also bathe in epsom salt, but this stuff is totally AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> I do not know how I ever missed this product.  For foot pain it is amazing.  Is quickly absorbed into the skin!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Epsom Salts in general after a good workout or to sooth swollen joints.  I was super pleased with this lotion.  My only complaint because it is salt based there is a bit of a residue on the skin.  Not a big deal if you apply at night and shower in the a.m.</li>
    <li> This is a good product that is mildly soothing, but I was looking for a more &amp;#34;kicked up&amp;#34; version that I felt immediately.</li>
    <li> Fast acting greatly relieves tired or stress aches an pains. I have chronic leg aches and it really helps relieve the pain and relax them. I love the stuff !! Buy 2 bottles at least...</li>
    <li> Good Stuff, try it . Watch the pain go bye bye. Watch the swelling go bye bye. Try it. OK</li>
    <li> It arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;It really doesn&#x27;t take my pain away.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will work for others</li>
    <li> This product is non-greasy, no odor pain relief. I have neuropathy, and it is nice to have something with out pepper products in it. My pets sit beside  me or by my feet, and this lotion doesnt cause any irritation for their eyes.I am buying more for next month.</li>
    <li> My husband has an extremely bad back, he has had 2 operations, and needless to say, he hurts all the time. We have used bio freeze, tiger balm, all kinds of things to give him some relief. This works better than all the rest!</li>
    <li> I use this lotion almost every night.  It has helped.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It goes on my skin so softly and it really takes my Psoriasis Placque from my skin ever so gently. I hope they never stop making this lotion for us Psoriasis patients. It&#x27;s an absolutely must for us! Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Waste of money. It did not feel any of the relief and soothing I get when I soaking in Epsom salt. It felt like some generic lotion with no hydration or softening qualities. I was disappointed hoping that the lotion would be a alternative to having to soak in Epsom salt</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. It works on leg cramps, back pain, etc. I get almost instant relief and it lasts almost an entire day.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing for me. An epsom salt bath is far better of soothing your muscles.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this product. I is no different than putting water on your skin. A waste of money!</li>
    <li> I have arthritis and other issues in my neck, which causes the muscles in my upper back/shoulders/neck to spasm. While it hasn&#x27;t relieved all the pain, it has given me some much-needed relief! I also use this on my legs after a long run and it helps!!</li>
    <li> Amazing. I received this product last night after working in the yard all day. My arthritic thumbs usually have me out of commission with aspirin and an ice bag on my hands. Nice to not have aching hands throughout the evening after cutting wood, raking or shoveling. I&#x27;m glad I ordered this on Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> More like oil - very watery consistency - would not call it lotion</li>
    <li> I got this to try at the same time I ordered Two Old Goats, because I wasn&#x27;t able to find them locally.  It is okay, but I prefer the smell and results of Two Old Goats better.  I do continue to use Epsom Salt in my bath water and use this afterwards at bedtime.  Have seem some benefits but not as much as I expected or needed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION . I HAVE A BAD KNEE AND IT RELIEVES THE PAIN QUICKLY AND LONG TERM. I GAVE BOTTLES T0 MY DAUGHTER WHO HAS ARTHRITIS. SHE LOVES IT TOO.</li>
    <li> This Lotion is AMAZING. It&#x27;s the only non-Glycolic lotion that I value for medicinal purposes. It&#x27;s Great for achey body-parts, helps a sore back right away - &amp; sore feet or legs. It&#x27;s also soothing, just like an epsom salt bath. We are all short on Magnesium in our bodies as well, &amp; it fights parasites &amp; fungus (including candidas). It&#x27;s Beautiful!! You can even put some on your face. It makes your skin soft too. It&#x27;s very nice!! And the guys will love it as much as the girls, if not More - very unisex. The guys that think they don&#x27;t like or need lotion, will ask for this after they&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> helped i will buy again skin was very dry as well . also help with a infected cut heal great</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle! I threw my back out and couldn&#x27;t MOVE! I was passed out on the couch with pain killers and muscle relaxers. One night when nothing was even putting a dent in the paint (the meds, a massager, or heating pad) I used this to see if it would even take the edge off and it completely took away ALL of the pain! After suffering several days with intense pain, I used this a couple of times and the pain was completely gone. I suggested it to my neighbor after she hurt her leg and she had a similar experience. She then has given it out to friends and family and they too have had many amazing experiences with it.  I use it on my kids when they have leg aches. I won&#x27;t be without it in my medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced, basically scentless and leaves no residue. Doesn&#x27;t totally fix my aches and pains but does help ease stiffness and soreness. My Naprapath recommended lotion as a way to get more magnesium into my muscles and I will continue to use. Easy to apply and much less fuss than soaking in Epsom salts.</li>
    <li> I like this; it relaxed my muscles within 2 minutes! Very good sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used epsom salt for 3 years to help heal a neck injury and it works&lt;br /&gt;Helps heal muscle sprains, even seems to help joints, bruises heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relaxed muscles enable movement and then the bones align naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Morton creates a non-paraben, chemical free version for people that prefer organic products.&lt;br /&gt;I get a hormone imbalance if use the paraben version too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried another brand of Magnesium, a oil; it seemed to cause a overdose. Overdosing on magnesium can cause weak muscles, other problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any problems with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The consistency is just fine for me.  I usually apply it just after a shower and it absorbs quickly.  I use it mostly to control blemishes, but it works great on my swollen ankles and muscles that ache.  I really wish Amazon would get this product in stock.  It was an add-on for 7 or 8 bucks.  I&#x27;m not paying $18 bucks for this.  I will try to find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Fast and effortless.  I put lotion over it when I have used a lot because it can leave a white film.  But its worth it for the pain relief</li>
    <li> Works great on so many different things, i.e. Fibromyalgia, Arthritis, back and hip pain, that I have also bought this lotion for my mother in law for her aches and pains. Easy to use and affordable!</li>
    <li> It works!&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say to anyone who also suffers those annoying and painful  leg cramps that awaken you in the middle of the night?&lt;br /&gt;i bought a second for a friend and he keeps thanking me every time I see him.</li>
