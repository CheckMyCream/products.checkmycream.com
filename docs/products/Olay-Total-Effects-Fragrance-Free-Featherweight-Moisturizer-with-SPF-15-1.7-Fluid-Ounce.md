      <li>I&#x27;ve seen so many nice faces, then a crinkly neck, and cleavage.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer goes on smoothly and feels very nice and light on the skin.  </li>

      <li>It is very light, not greasy at all.</li>

      <li>I am pleased with the SPF in the lotion as well.</li>
      <li>Does make me a tad shiny, so I make sure to put powder on afterward (</li>
      <li>Foundation can coverup most of the breakouts</li>
      <li>it goes* :)</li>
      <li>I like the fact that their moisturizer is not as greasy as so many.  </li>
      <li>When this bottle is finished I plan to buy more of it and continue to use it.</li>
      <li>Why so many cosmetics insist on adding these as ingredients is beyond me.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in love with this face lotion.  </li>
      <li>Loved this the first 2 days, then the acne began...and didn&#x27;t end for weeks after stopping this product.  </li>
      <li>This makes Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free Featherweight Moisturizer with SPF 15, a perfect portable must-have...</li>
      <li>My face feels soft and looks great after using this for just a week.</li>
      <li>If Olay wants to offer products that are GOOD for our skin, they need to consider what they&#x27;re using as ingredients.</li>
      <li>It spreads across my skin evenly and easy.  </li>
      <li>It goes on very light, dries quickly and makes my skin feel silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles&lt;</li>
      <li>Olay makes fine quality products and this is one of them.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;- dimethicone (a silicone which helps fill in fine lines and wrinkles)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Olay, is easily bought, and gives me fantastic results.  </li>
      <li>Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles&lt;</li>
      <li>Silky Smooth skin.</li>
      <li>formula is 100% fragrance free and protects against both UVA and UVB rays.  </li>
      <li>lotion goes on smoothly, adsorbs well and does not leave any residue</li>
      <li>It is supposed to be fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>all are lightweight and feel comfortable and not sticky.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
      <li>Goes on light, has light sun protection, blends well with my foundation</li>
      <li>It says it&#x27;s fragrance free</li>
      <li>The dispenser button is notable because it has a smooth hollowed out section where one&#x27;s fore finger rests to press and dispense just the right amount of Moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Sunscreen wise, it seems to be just as much effective as any other</li>
      <li>Apply to a clean face for an all-over feeling of fresh, healthy and youthful skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The light floral scent quickly dissipates, so one does not continually smell it all day.</li>
      <li>So naturally I was intrigued by the claims of Olay regarding this product, as it as super sheer and excellent as they touted?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>fragrance is nice and clean smelling but if you are sensitive to smells this might bother you&lt;br</li>
      <li>The moisturizer goes absorbs right away and it is fragrance free as Olay states.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get in the sun very much, so would probably work fine with me.  </li>
      <li>I got on board, and have been a loyal Olay customer.  </li>
      <li>It felt so smooth upon application and it seemed to instantly make my face look smoother, with a nice hint of a glow.  </li>
      <li>This oil free product came compliments of the Amazon Vine program and I am thoroughly enjoying it thus far.  </li>
      <li>Feels good, keeps my skin looking much younger than my years, and the price is right.  </li>
      <li>First off: I was sent the non-fragrance free version of this lotion</li>
      <li>Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free Featherweight Moisturizer with SPF 15 sound like what you may be looking for? :)  </li>
      <li>Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free Featherweight Moisturizer with SPF 15 sound like what you may be looking for? :)  </li>
      <li>If I didn&#x27;t want to worry about the sunscreen part, I would probably just use Ponds, it smells great, goes a long way and is very inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>:) The container is very nice:  a very sturdy plastic -- with a nice lock down *audible click when closed*</li>
      <li>My husband also used it for a few days and liked it so much he  bought his own supply.</li>
      <li>My favorite moisturizer with sunscreen is from Burt&#x27;s Bees and it has NO parabens in it and is 98.2% natural.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is easily absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how it smoothed on so easily, spread so far, and soaked in so quickly.</li>
      <li>, I still loved all the other benefits.  </li>
      <li>The pump helps you get out just the right amount of lotion.</li>
      <li>I tried this stuff on my 40yo skin and it wasn&#x27;t quite right for me...</li>
      <li>Though it states Fragrance-Free, I find it to have a light and lovely soft and gentle scent which is not irritating or offensive.  </li>
      <li>way I use this product is to cleanse the skin first followed by applying the moisturizer (one pump&#x27;s worth).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just as good as my cheaper Pond&#x27;s Day Lotion, maybe slightly nicer, but there&#x27;s the rub.  </li>
      <li>Olay Total Effects 7 Moisturizer with Sunscreen is a lightweight and comfortable moisturizer that applies smoothly and has practically no scent.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see the long term effects, but I will definitely continue using it, if even for just the short term effects of smoothness and the perfect glow.&amp;#34; So for more mature skin, this stuff is a major win!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just funny that way.  </li>
      <li>It is the first step in my beauty routine each morning, after washing my face and toning, to use a lightweight sunscreen on my face and decolletage.</li>
      <li>I should have read the ingredient list first, not just the glowing reviews.</li>
      <li>If I were going to be outside a lot, I would switch to a more heavy-duty sunscreen.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This lotion glides on gorgeously and makes my skin feel brighter and smoother upon application. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Disapappointed, contains paraben.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my face all shiny and heavy feeling. This featherweight moisturizer fits the bill perfectly. It has no fragrance so I don&#x27;t smell like the cosmetics counter at Macy&#x27;s. My skin feels softer and looks better after using Olay Total Effects for two weeks. It has been unseasonably sunny here in the Pacific Northwest the past few weeks so it&#x27;s been nice to have a wideband sunscreen to keep the harmful, aging rays off my face. I apply this moisturizer after I wash my face in the morning. I keep my face a little wet and the lotion slathers on easily and smoothly, while locking in moisture. I will continue to use Olay Total Effects moisturizer during the summer months as the sun becomes stronger. It&#x27;s nice to have a sunscreen based moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or mask-like. An excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream every day for two weeks now and I will continue to do so. When this bottle is finished I plan to buy more of it and continue to use it. It provides good all day hydration during extremely cold northeast winter days. My husband also used it for a few days and liked it so much he  bought his own supply. All in all a hit.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific all-purpose facial moisturizer, agreeably priced.  It is non-oily and has no fragrance; leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> It would appear that Olay is attempting to compete with No. 7 Products by Boots. They are comparable in price. I have oily skin and I find that when I use this product, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling &amp;#34;more&amp;#34; oily, like the old Olay products of yesteryear. Also, with this product, I find that I don&#x27;t have to wear foundation. I can skip the foundation and just apply powder and my skin looks just as nice. I use it twice a day and you don&#x27;t need much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be keeping a close watch and doing a little experimenting to see if I prefer the Olay 7 or the boots No. 7. The jury is still out.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely lightweight moisturizer with light sunscreen.  I don&#x27;t get in the sun very much, so would probably work fine with me.  It absorbs immediately in the skin.  I was amazed; it&#x27;s not like a thick creme that leaves your face feeling greasy.  This moisturizer goes into the skin immediately.  It is supposed to be fragrance free.  I really couldn&#x27;t smell anything.  Maybe a very slight scent that goes away immediately.  That could be because of the sunscreen feature.  You only need to use a little bit to cover the face, a little goes a long way.  Olay makes fine quality products and this is one of them.  Since I usually don&#x27;t buy Olay, I was eager to try this through Vine.  I like it a lot, but to me, the price is a little high.  Although, the amount you have to use is very little to cover your face, so it should last a long time.  But the high price (to me) prohibits me for giving it five stars, and the price in the long run might be prohibitive for others.  If I didn&#x27;t want to worry about the sunscreen part, I would probably just use Ponds, it smells great, goes a long way and is very inexpensive.  I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see if it helped with slight winkles on the face.  If it could help eliminate wrinkles, then it would definitely get five stars and I would continue to use this product.  I will finish out the bottle and see what happens regarding lines in the face and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I should have saved my money. I do have sensitive, acne-prone skin, but the Olay Total Effects moisturizer was never a problem. I used this in the a.m. for two days and broke out around my nose and on my chin. My face looked shiny, too. I am now using Clinique -- the yellow moisturizing lotion -- but still need sunscreen. I might have to get it from mineral makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a very light moisturizer with sun protection. Some thick and mask like, but this doesn&#x27;t. The fragrance is light and doesn&#x27;t overpower. It&#x27;s perfect for every day use, but not for extended or intense sun protection. A small amount is enough to cover my face and neck. I tried a similar Lancome product and it didn&#x27;t last very long because I needed a huge dollop to cover the same area. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now, twice a day, and I&#x27;m not overly impressed. It states that it&#x27;s fragrance free, but it definitely has a scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering but it is noticeable, even a few hours later. The lotion is tacky feeling on my skin at first. It dries slower than a gel moisturizer I&#x27;ve been using, but it does feel very light when it is dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box states that there are 7 benefits from it:&lt;br /&gt;1. visibly smoothing lines and wrinkles - slightly noticeable improvement&lt;br /&gt;2. evens skin tone appearance - no difference noted&lt;br /&gt;3. enhances brightness - no difference noted&lt;br /&gt;4. instantly minimizes the look of pores - slightly noticeable improvement&lt;br /&gt;5. visible reduces dark patches - noticeable improvement, good results&lt;br /&gt;6. restores firmness - no difference noted, but not much needed before using product&lt;br /&gt;7. replenishes moisture - noticeable improvement, no oily feeling during the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue using it to see if I achieve the benefits where I haven&#x27;t seen a difference. I am pleased with the SPF in the lotion as well. Between that and my BB cream, I feel like my skin is well protected from sun damage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s called featherweight and they claim you can&#x27;t feel it, but I thought it was pretty similar to a lot of other moisturizers. I did feel like I was wearing something, which was disappointing based on the write-up. But it didn&#x27;t have a fragrance, and my skin didn&#x27;t react poorly to it, so it&#x27;s still 4 stars</li>
    <li> Good product from Olay. It is very light, not greasy at all. It lasts through the whole day and does not cause any problems with my skin. No break outs. I liked this product and would buy it again, i just wish it smelled good. It has your typical sunscreen smell.Very faint since it is supposed to be fragrance free.</li>
    <li> The pump of the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t work, product is not usable.</li>
    <li> Straight out of the bottle and I&#x27;m in love with this face lotion.  It says it&#x27;s fragrance free but there is such a light scent and it is so pleasing.  I typically don&#x27;t like any fragrance to my face lotion but this is perfect!!!  I love that one pump dispenses the exact amount I need without any waste.  It spreads across my skin evenly and easy.  With the added SPF15, I know that I&#x27;m somewhat protected in this Colorado climate. If I do plan to be in direct sunlight I bump up to a SPF30 but for everyday wear, this does the job.  I love the way my skin feels soft and smooth after only 2 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Olay has been a go-to brand for generations in my family.  This oil free product came compliments of the Amazon Vine program and I am thoroughly enjoying it thus far.  We&#x27;re in the Northeast and have suffered an unusually frigid winter this year, so dry skin is part of the package here.  This easy to store and even easier to dispense pump bottle is perfect for bedside or vanity in your bath or bedroom.  Though it states Fragrance-Free, I find it to have a light and lovely soft and gentle scent which is not irritating or offensive.  The consistency is smooth and coverage is complete with only a small pump in your hand.  The product lists 7 benefits all in 1 bottle including smoothing fine lines (this worked for me!), evening skin tone, enhancing brightness (again a plus for me) and restoring firmness and moisture.  I didn&#x27;t notice a visible reduction in the appearance of dark patches, but this wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me, I still loved all the other benefits.  Apply to a clean face for an all-over feeling of fresh, healthy and youthful skin.  With an SPF of 15 it&#x27;s perfect for use in the colder months when you don&#x27;t normally slather on the sunscreen.  Added bonus is that this contains Vitamins E and B3 along with other nutrients that help your skin stay smooth and youthful looking.  I apply both in the morning before my minimal makeup routine, then again before bedtime after the daily grime is washed away.  I recommend this for all skin types as well.  Excellent and affordable skincare.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. The pump helps you get out just the right amount of lotion. It smooths into my skin very easily. It&#x27;s not drippy and has a nice consistency. It does have a slight residue that if you keep spreading easily rubs into my skin. There is no real smell and nothing negative about this lotion. It does a great job of moisturizing and has the nice perk of providing some sun protection too.</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff on my 40yo skin and it wasn&#x27;t quite right for me... I found it a bit too heavy. I shared it with my 60yo aunt when she came visiting for a few days, and she LOVED IT SO HARD. She emailed me afterwards saying, &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff!!  I like it so much that I use it day and night, and sometimes twice during the day for that extra bit of freshening up.  It felt so smooth upon application and it seemed to instantly make my face look smoother, with a nice hint of a glow.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see the long term effects, but I will definitely continue using it, if even for just the short term effects of smoothness and the perfect glow.&amp;#34; So for more mature skin, this stuff is a major win!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy at all.  The moisturizer goes absorbs right away and it is fragrance free as Olay states.  The pump is nice for dispensing, but pumps always leave me feeling like I&#x27;m not getting all of the product when it reaches the last little bit.  The only other minor downside is that it&#x27;s only a SPF of 15.</li>
    <li> Really nice, lightweight moisturizer with sunscreen. Perfect for summer. Does make me a tad shiny, so I make sure to put powder on afterward (but I always do that anyway).</li>
    <li> I am incredibly picky about lotion for my face.  I know I should be using moisturizer, especially something with some sort of SPF protection, daily, but I just don&#x27;t a lot of the time because everything is scented to me.  This &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; lotion almost does the trick, but it still smells when I apply it.  It doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I need to sneeze all day long (or cause me to sneeze all day long), so i&#x27;ll count that as success.  It feels very light so it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel weird when I use it.</li>
    <li> I expected with the name of this product &amp;#34;Featherweight&amp;#34; that it would absorb immediately into the skin and you wouldn&#x27;t feel it.  That is not the case.  It has a sunscreen in it and after I put it on, it felt like there was a thin film of plastic on my face.  I did not like this product. Should have kept the box and returned it.  Like my L&#x27;Oreal with Vitamin E moisturizer MUCH better.  Should have just stuck with a winner.</li>
    <li> Loved this the first 2 days, then the acne began...and didn&#x27;t end for weeks after stopping this product.  Deep, hard, red, enormous lesions that just stay and stay.  I haven&#x27;t had acne like this in 20 years.  Back to regular Total Effects, which actually improves my blemishes, instead of creating them in droves.  I should have read the ingredient list first, not just the glowing reviews.</li>
    <li> Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free Featherweight Moisturizer with SPF 15, 1.7 Fluid Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Category: Skin Care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Embrace the weightless feel of Olay 7-in-1 fragrance free featherweight moisturizer with broad spectrum SPF 15. Get younger-looking skin without the heaviness of traditional moisturizers. Olay fragrance free featherweight absorbs quickly and is simple to apply and in addition to moisturizing its been created with solasheer technology providing broad spectrum SPF 15 for protection from harmful UV A/UV B rays when used as directed. This multi-tasking moisturizer provides 7 beauty benefits to skin for a youthful bright look. Give your skin weightless-feeling sun-protected beauty from Olay total effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a moisturizer label says 15SPF and oil-free -- well... *into My Shopping Cart it goes* :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes after using the Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free Featherweight Moisturizer with SPF 15, continually, for a couple of weeks, as per instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free Featherweight Moisturizer with SPF 15 is not a runny moisturizer, but a semi-thick - white - lotion.  A very silky texture that glides over skin and quickly disappears, into my fair/medium toned skin -- leaving behind a satin-like, matte, finish. I have no idea how it looks on darker skin tones. No sticky or tacky residue left behind. The oil free aspect is a major plus, if ya know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light floral scent quickly dissipates, so one does not continually smell it all day. :) The container is very nice:  a very sturdy plastic -- with a nice lock down *audible click when closed* cover lid.  This makes Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free Featherweight Moisturizer with SPF 15, a perfect portable must-have...just throw it in a beach bag, backpack, suitcase or purse...  The dispenser button is notable because it has a smooth hollowed out section where one&#x27;s fore finger rests to press and dispense just the right amount of Moisturizer.

    <li> I am picky about the chemicals I eat and apply to my body, and this Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free Featherweight Moisturizer with SPF 15 contains Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, and Propylparaben, which are linked to cancer.  Why so many cosmetics insist on adding these as ingredients is beyond me.  Based on these ingredients alone, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product.  I don&#x27;t even use anti-perspirant because they contain parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does offer light moisturizing and sun protection, and I like Olay as a brand (I&#x27;ve used their standard night cream and the liquid in the pink bottle for 30 years).  It had a very faint fragrance, soaked in quickly and left my skin moist but not heavily greased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good features:&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 15 sun protection&lt;br /&gt;- dimethicone (a silicone which helps fill in fine lines and wrinkles)&lt;br /&gt;- Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Tocopheryl Acetate and Tocopherol (two forms of Vitamin E) and Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), all of which are anti-aging ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But based on the parabens, I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars.  If Olay wants to offer products that are GOOD for our skin, they need to consider what they&#x27;re using as ingredients.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Olay products.  I like the fact that their moisturizer is not as greasy as so many.  This is a nice product because it combines the sunscreen with the moisturizer but with an SPF of only 15 it really won&#x27;t due if you plan anytime in the sun.  The product is essentially fragrance free, there is a slight scent that dissipates fairly quickly.  It would take an SPF of 30 for me to give this a five star review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sunscreen fanatic, being very pale and fair skinned (of Scandinavian descent) and so I try and wear sunscreen under my makeup every day. It is the first step in my beauty routine each morning, after washing my face and toning, to use a lightweight sunscreen on my face and decolletage. So naturally I was intrigued by the claims of Olay regarding this product, as it as super sheer and excellent as they touted?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am indeed very pleased with this moisturizer product. It has broad spectrum SPF 15, which is amazing for a moisturizer or facial sunscreen. It is fragrance free, although it does have a slight smell which is very subtle. I felt it went on feeling a *little* bit greasy--which is one quality I hate in sunscreen--but once it dried a couple minutes later, my skin has a pleasant feel to it once again. It is not at all heavy nor does it leave a greasy film like most sport sunscreens.  It worked well under my makeup, as long as I let it soak in and dry before moving onto makeup application. Sunscreen wise, it seems to be just as much effective as any other I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I have to say I&#x27;m a bit disappointed to read that this product contains parabens. I mean, this is 2015, and the whole purpose of wearing sunscreen is to decrease your risk of skin cancer. So why put a nasty thing like parabens--which can cause cancer--into such a product? I don&#x27;t get it. The other thing is, I know they can do it without parabens. My favorite moisturizer with sunscreen is from Burt&#x27;s Bees and it has NO parabens in it and is 98.2% natural. (Also, they don&#x27;t torment animals with animal testing, whereas Olay--a Procter &amp; Gamble company--does, as far as I know.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what it comes down to is this: I really liked how this product performed. I just probably won&#x27;t be using it because it defeats the purpose to put a product with known cancer-causing ingredients in it to help reduce my risk of skin cancer. I want to like Olay, I just think they could do a better job, ingredients wise. ESPECIALLY at this price!k they could do a better job, ingredients wise. ESPECIALLY at this price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m early sixties, and a long time Olay skin care user. Years ago, after reading that one of Olay&#x27;s overnight creams, ranked higher in tests, than a super expensive European cream, used by movies stars.  I got on board, and have been a loyal Olay customer.  Olay, is easily bought, and gives me fantastic results.  To say I see improvement, I can&#x27;t since I&#x27;ve been already using Olay for years, but I do love this cream, for the way it goes on and feels on my skin, but I can tell that it works. I&#x27;ve got the oily T zone, still and this cream doesn&#x27;t make my skin shiny.  Feels good, keeps my skin looking much younger than my years, and the price is right.  There&#x27;s a sunscreen to protect from those damaging UV A/UV B rays too.  For me, I&#x27;ve continued the skin care on my face, down my neck, and into my chest, where the sun can shine.  I&#x27;ve seen so many nice faces, then a crinkly neck, and cleavage.</li>
    <li> My wife really loved this product.  Having dry skin, she has used Nivea products for years.  Having used the Olay for over two weeks now, she finds the skin on her face softer than ever before.  She also noted that a little goes a long ways so one pump of this product is enough to cover her face plus the back of her hands.  She also appreciates that it does not feel greasy.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this Olay Total Effects moisturizer with light SPF, but after using it for over a week I am really in the middle about it. Goes on light, has light sun protection, blends well with my foundation (I always put moisturizer under my foundation) and doesn&#x27;t make me oily. BUT after 3-4 days of wearing I noticed that my skin was breaking out around my mouth and cheeks. At first I didn&#x27;t think it was from the moisturizer but when i tested it by not wearing a few days and then went back... so did my breakouts. Foundation can coverup most of the breakouts but I am still feeling a little self conscious about my face so I don&#x27;t think this product is for me. Such a shame as it really does go on light and with the added sun protection that means I don&#x27;t need to spray my face with SPF before I leave.</li>
    <li> Olay Total Effects 7 Moisturizer with Sunscreen is a lightweight and comfortable moisturizer that applies smoothly and has practically no scent. The 1.7oz pump bottle is small and will easily fit into your cosmetics or beach bag when away from home. The plastic cap fits snugly, but I always put items that are liquid in a plastic bag, just in case of leakage when traveling. I did not have any problems with skin sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Loreal Active Daily Moisture lotion and Simple&#x27;s Protecting Light Moisturizer, both SPF 15 products, it is about the same in thickness- all are lightweight and feel comfortable and not sticky. All have both UVA/UVB protection, but only Loreal Active claims 24 hour protection, while the other two require reapplication after 2 hours. Loreal Active Daily has a scent, the others do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for value, Olay Total Effects 7 (1.7 oz) lists at $21.99, sells for $10.31.&lt;br /&gt;Loreal Active Wear 4oz, list $7.99/sell $6.97&lt;br /&gt;Simple Protecting 4.2oz list $10.99/sell $7.61.&lt;br /&gt;At less than half the amount of product at more cost, Olay TE7 is the poorer value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you prefer Olay products or space is a big consideration, Olay Total Effects 7 would be a good choice, as long as you get it at a big discount- it is not worth $22 when so many other less pricey options available. If you want value, check out Loreal&#x27;s Active Daily or Simple&#x27;s Protecting moisturizers with SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good product value (when purchased at a discount with free shipping) and works as claimed. 5 stars</li>
    <li> This moisturizer goes on smoothly and feels very nice and light on the skin.  There&#x27;s no excessive shine.  The sunscreen, while only SPF 15, is a nice bonus and certainly enough for winter days here. If I were going to be outside a lot, I would switch to a more heavy-duty sunscreen.  Although the product says it is fragrance free, there is a very faint and pleasant aroma.  It&#x27;s not enough to bother even me, and I am sensitive to strong scents.  The pump functions well and dispenses as much or as little as you want.  I use this before concealer and a dusting of mineral foundation.  It&#x27;s just as good as my cheaper Pond&#x27;s Day Lotion, maybe slightly nicer, but there&#x27;s the rub.  This product costs roughly twice as much as the Pond&#x27;s,  $20.59 currently on Amazon.  I&#x27;m not sure I would be willing to pay that much for 1.7 oz of moisturizer, no matter how much marketing hype is attached to it.  I&#x27;m just funny that way.  Comes from having been around the track for quite a few years!</li>
    <li> First off: I was sent the non-fragrance free version of this lotion and it definitely has an aroma. Since I am sensitive to fragrances, I let my daughter, who is a young adult try the lotion and below are her thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion goes on smoothly, adsorbs well and does not leave any residue behind.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is nice and clean smelling but if you are sensitive to smells this might bother you&lt;br /&gt;The lotion does not clog my pores or cause breakouts&lt;br /&gt;I have some sensitivity to lotions and this one does not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SPF is only 15, so it is for seasons and times you will be primarily indoors.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is distinct and might be too much for those with sensitivity to smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Silky Smooth skin. My face feels soft and looks great after using this for just a week. You only need one pump for your whole face and neck. I was amazed at how it smoothed on so easily, spread so far, and soaked in so quickly. I think this is one of Oil of Olay&#x27;s best products. I am also using it to help dissolve the age spots on my arms. I&#x27;ll come back and let you know what happens...</li>
    <li> As a long time user of Olay products, this product interested me, mainly because it provides SPF15 in addition to the featherweight moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula is 100% fragrance free and protects against both UVA and UVB rays.  Having said that, all moisturizers have some inherent scent.  This one doesn&#x27;t contain any perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use this product is to cleanse the skin first followed by applying the moisturizer (one pump&#x27;s worth).  The moisturizer hydrates and renews skin.  The moisturizer is easily absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had an adverse reaction to using this product and my skin is left feeling hydrated and smooth.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like all the Oil of Olay products I&#x27;ve tried and this one is no different. It goes on very light, dries quickly and makes my skin feel silky and smooth. I don&#x27;t always wear makeup, but a moisturizer is a must every day and I am very happy with this. I have sensitive skin, so I have to be careful with the products I chose, but have had no issues with this. Overall, I love it and will be purchasing it again in the future......</li>
