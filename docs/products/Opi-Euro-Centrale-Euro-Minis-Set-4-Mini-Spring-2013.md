      <li>all colors were nice but the one i bought it for</li>

      <li>I love OPI</li>
      <li>It seemed like some of the minis had better quality polish in them then others.</li>
      <li>Love them both.</li>

      <li>One of OPI&#x27;s better palettes.</li>
      <li>I love the size of the set</li>
      <li>and I get so many compliments.</li>

      <li>They are definitely minis. :)</li>
      <li>Nice colors but way to small of nail polishes, didn&#x27;t get my money worth.</li>
      <li>Hope she will like it, the for colors are very youth for girl I think.</li>

      <li>I almost would have rather spent a but more and gotten regular sized bottles.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe there was no thought by the person who sent this, the package is clear!</li>
      <li>I recommend having a solid white to paint underneath for full coverage.</li>
      <li>and I love that they&#x27;re in such small bottles because I never use a whole bottle of polish before it expires.</li>
      <li>Old product.</li>
      <li>arrived fast, like the colors, its my first OPI polish, i was hoping it wont chip for at least couple days, but it doesnt last long as most polishes...</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s technically OPI&#x27;s spring collection, I have no trouble wearing them in the summertime.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know if that is how those colors usually go on</li>
<li> Two minis in the set had really thick, goopy, hard to apply polish in them.</li>
<li> or if I just got a bad batch.</li>
<li> Disappointed all around.</li>

    <li> Nice colors but way to small of nail polishes, didn&#x27;t get my money worth.</li>
    <li> Love that it does not easily chip. I recommend having a solid white to paint underneath for full coverage.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful but it is hard to cover the nail and get the color. I love the size of the set</li>
    <li> arrived fast, like the colors, its my first OPI polish, i was hoping it wont chip for at least couple days, but it doesnt last long as most polishes...</li>
    <li> I ordered these for a Christmas gift. It came the last day of the shipping window. Box was damaged. One of the polishes was completely dry (the bottle was empty)! Unfortunately, it was the color the young girl liked the best. I can&#x27;t believe there was no thought by the person who sent this, the package is clear! Disappointed all around. Old product. Would not buy from this vendor again. Not worth the hassle to return. Would not buy this type of item again where it can not be inspected prior to purchase.</li>
    <li> I gave this gift to my roommate as a small gesture for all she does for me, and she loved it! It was exactly as expected and came within the expected time. The colors are pretty and (as of the moment) trendy. The only thing to keep in mind is that you should realize that they are not large! They are definitely minis. :)</li>
    <li> I really love this OPI set, I am currently wearing the Lavender color and I get so many compliments. All of the colors are perfect for Spring/Summer.</li>
    <li> One of OPI&#x27;s better palettes. I got a heap of compliments on the colors already, from strangers just noticing my nails. Although it&#x27;s technically OPI&#x27;s spring collection, I have no trouble wearing them in the summertime. Each of the four polishes adds that pop of color on your nails and/or feet.</li>
    <li> These colors are a hit in every season, there is at least one that&#x27;s on par with what&#x27;s trendy. However, each bottle was way smaller than I anticipated. I almost would have rather spent a but more and gotten regular sized bottles. I&#x27;m glad they came as a pack, I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to buy the blue or gold but they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> It looks good and did not open it for it is a gift for my friends. Hope she will like it, the for colors are very youth for girl I think.</li>
    <li> These collections are so much fun and OPI is the best!</li>
    <li> The colors are perfect for summertime and I love that they&#x27;re in such small bottles because I never use a whole bottle of polish before it expires. &amp;#34;You&#x27;re such a Budapest&amp;#34; is my absolute favorite! The staying quality is on point and I have minimal chipping when I paint my fingernails with these colors.</li>
    <li> It seemed like some of the minis had better quality polish in them then others. Two minis in the set had really thick, goopy, hard to apply polish in them. I don&#x27;t know if that is how those colors usually go on or if I just got a bad batch. Other than that great set.</li>
    <li> easy to use, fun mix and match.  have a spa day for your nails !!</li>
    <li> The colors are so very pretty yet the coverage sucks! I love OPI but this just not cutting it!&lt;br /&gt;Btw this is not A reflection on the seller- the package arrived very quickly and again, the colors are as shown, so pretty. But, you will need 4-5 coats for any kind of opacity, and I wish I had just used the money to get a manicure at the salon instead.</li>
    <li> all colors were nice but the one i bought it for you  have to apply many coats and it doesnt look right ever any imperfection shows with great detail.</li>
    <li> These colors scream summer. They go on smoothly and are flawless. I&#x27;ve tried the pink/coral and the turquoise blue. These are the fashion colors of summer 2013. Love them both. OPI does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I guess I should have seen the size.  The bottles are really tiny, but for a trial of color it&#x27;s ok...</li>
