<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Super nice - And after so many years (i think i had it 3 years now!) it still works like a charm</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not yet used it because I&#x27;ve been so busy.  But I am sure I will like it if it does as well as those in those nail salons.</li>
    <li> Trust me, I was hoping to be one of the reviewers giving this product a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;The moment I plugged it in, it was already broken. SUCKS.</li>
    <li> I purchased this uv lamp because I just starting doing acrylic nails and I needed one to cure nail polish.I read reviews and decided on this one.I&#x27;ve only use the lamp a couple of times but I like it and it has two timer settings on back.I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Bulbs won&#x27;t stay in sockets.Must be plugged in when used.Not very useful to dry nails.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, I guess I assumed it came with a fan inside which is what I really wanted. Either way I didn&#x27;t keep it and not because  I didn&#x27;t like it but I needed one with a fan inside. If anyone does decide to return this, contact the seller directly makes things a lot faster</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised, works great with my gelshine products and the item was received on time as promised!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!  It is just like  the salon dryers.&lt;br /&gt;Love that it is pink.  Does a great job of drying nails!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered a month ago but used today. This thing doesn&#x27;t cure and the tuner doesn&#x27;t work. It looks better than it works.</li>
    <li> good quality product .....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no professional, but my nails have never looked better with me doing them myself.  They are dry and shiny without the added touch-ups I usually have to make.  For a busy mom like me, I needed something to help me feel feminine and beautiful.  My plain nails were just not doing it for me anymore, so having this nail dryer to dry my cute nail color (quickly) gives me a brief time-out to do something for myself.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this light for well over a month now. I use it all the time on friends, family, and myself. It had preformed wonderfully! I highly recommend to anyone starting out because its not expensive but yet..works just as well as a professional lamp! Two hands will fit at once if you stack them but you have to be careful not to touch your own nails or the sides of the lamp when putting your hands in like this. Its best to do one hand at a time while someone works on the other hand for you.</li>
    <li> I love this nail dryer and it came in a matter of 3 days.</li>
    <li> Its, great! Works well with shalac. Needed it for school practice at home and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I really  don&#x27;t like it  and would like to return it  the watts is to low for my product use. I need 36 watts</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a Christmas present and the first time they tried to use it, it didn&#x27;t work. It would not turn on at all...... So frustrated.</li>
    <li> Works great, salon quality and I love it in pink!</li>
    <li> There was a weird sticky film on the part where you put your hand in and it gets on my hands when I use it :/</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 12 year old daughter.  She and her girlfriends love to paint their nails.  This really helps with the setting and drying of the polish. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this thing. It is big enough for your entire hand and it would also fit your foot in there with plenty of room. Good price to.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!!  Works great!!  Have already used it twice! I highly recommed this product if you are looking for a new UV light!!</li>
    <li> I love this uv lamp! it works like it is supposed to. no complaints from this girl. I have used it a hundred times or more!</li>
    <li> Loved the color that&#x27;s about it! And So I just bought this last week! And first time trying it all excited the darn thing shorted out and caught on fire.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful.  Dried my nails quickly just like in the salon.  I noticed some women said it took a long time for their nails to dry, it may be because of one of two things.&lt;br /&gt;1.  If you used regular nail polish, this will not work, it is for gel nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;2.  If you used gel nail polish and it feels sticky, you need to take a cotton ball, put alcohol on it and rub it across the nails to take away the sticky residue.  I know it seems like it would wipe the polish off, it doesn&#x27;t you will see that you have a hard shiny finish, just like in the salon.  Love it, I may buy another one so I can do both hands at the same time or both feet at the same time.</li>
    <li> This uv lamp works great!! I love how it came in well packaged and the bulbs were already installed. All I had to do was just start using it. I would definitely buy from this place again.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails because although i miss out on that awesome hand massage they do at a nail salon, i can determine the length, shape and color/design, and i never have those awkward moments that happen so often when you have no idea what the nail stylist just said/is saying about you...come on, that can&#x27;t just happen to me.  The only problem with doing my own nails is that i never seem to give them enough time to dry.  It seems to take forever for them to fully set (to me, forever is anything more than 30-40 minutes), and even if i am just studying while they dry, i always end up banging them on something (my desk, my backpack, my binder, my pencil etc.)  The UV light made it dry so much faster and i&#x27;m not sure how to explain it but they just looked better, like really smooth and even and durable, like each layer of paint was dried instead of just the top which would always result in some dent or nick.  This is super easy to use.  I just set the timer, and stick one hand in at a time.  Generally i use the UV light twice: after i have put on a base coat and the first coat of color, and then again after i have put on the second coat of color and a top coat.  If you like to do your own nails but are prone to banging them on something before they dry, and you can&#x27;t stand the dents/smudges it leaves, this is the perfect product for you!</li>
    <li> I have used this item 3 times so far and it&#x27;s performed just like it should.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived damage free, and the color is a dark fuschia pink. Its lightweight, portable and allows me to do shellac manicures at home instead of paying salon prices.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> Very good light for the price!</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. It was inexpensive and works great on my nails....use it all the time for my gel manicure.</li>
    <li> I love my UV gel lamp! It works amazingly, dries nails quick and came with awesome bulbs! Also has settings for different timings and everything for an awesome price! Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I would have given this product five stars but when we hooked it up and used it two of the bulbs were out</li>
    <li> Works great, a little bigger than I thought it would be, but very happy with it.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this dryer I decided it would be a good choice for me. It&#x27;s a nice size , light weight , lights already installed , you just plug in. Very easy. The pink is bright and girly, just fun. It works perfectly for my at home use but I would also take this into my salon ( I&#x27;m a hair stylist ) if I where to start doing gels for my clients. I would purchase this one again and have two at work if I ever decide to do just that . Love it ! Would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> it was bigger than i expected and louder. also the bulbs were previously installed like it may have been used before</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product. Therefore I will Probably return it. Very tinny. Takes WAAAAY to long to dry your nails.</li>
    <li> Worst light ever&lt;br /&gt;Wasted 3 hours and my nails werent even dry then&lt;br /&gt;It also burns your hand, its ridiculous</li>
    <li> The light works pretty well, it arrived with one bulb not working. The pink is a vibrant pink which I really like.</li>
    <li> Love my new gel dryer. I was previously using a mini one from a start up kit. This is so much better and its pink too!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Does the job I need done.  And the best part was the price.  I may get a second one of these for home use.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for what it&#x27;s advertised for. It sets and dries standard nail polish very well and last for days. I do not use it for gel polish or acrylic nails etc., just a basic manicure and polish I can use at home to get a professional look to my nails. It certainly far exceeds a $20-$25 dollar trip to a nail salon every week. Now I can get the same results at home. Great Product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it5&lt;br /&gt;Only if it didn&#x27;t come broken a built in fan wouldn&#x27;t hurt.otherwise it works GREAT!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.  I have already used this lamp on myself, my sister, my daughter,  and it has been great.  You can also use your feet in there too. It was the cheapest one on amazon.  My friend got hers for $60 at Sally and I paid $19. And not to mention mine is hot pink!  I will for sure by from this seller again and when mine gives out I will Def reorder another one.</li>
    <li> Lights were installed and boxes for the bulbs were inside the dryer. Not sure why they even included the box...maybe so the customer knows what to order when they burn out. There are two switches on the back and a button. There is an on and off switch and a 120sec or 180sec switch. If the timer switch is in the middle the light will just stay on. If the switch is flipped to one of the times then when the button is pressed the light will turn off after the time is up. I didn&#x27;t think a light this cheap would have this feature. I am glad it does, one less thing I have to keep track of.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered quickly. However it was packaged poorly. When I opened the box, 2 of the bulbs where no longer connected with the bulb base. The base was stuck in the light socket and I had to struggle to remove it. I had extra bulbs so once I finally removed the broken ones  I was able to replace them, and then the lamp worked fine.</li>
    <li> this nail dryer came to me a little damaged but is still usable. i think its really adorable and it works fine. because its so cheap, i feel like they don&#x27;t mind selling a slitghly damaged product.</li>
    <li> Gel nail polish is new for me.  I first went to a salon and loved the looks and how long it lasts so I am trying this for myself.  I like this little dryer but 180 sec timer doesn&#x27;t seem to cure the gel with one setting - it remains a little sticky.  After doing it another 180 sec it seems to work. I used the 180 sec timer after each coat (base, 2 coats of gel, top coat). I couldn&#x27;t find any reviews that stated how long a cure should really be with a 36 watt dryer so I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.  UPDATE   After checking a few things, I realized I wasn&#x27;t polishing correctly....use light coats..base, cure, light 1st coat of color gel, cure, light 2nd coat color, cure, light top coat, cure....then lightly brush nails with rubbing alcohol which removes top coat stickiness.....now they   are perfect!   180 sec cure on eeach coat was perfect...great little mackine</li>
    <li> She really likes it works great, nails dry in about 5 minutes. Just a little bigger than expected.Don&#x27;t have to wait forever for nails to dry.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my Girlfriend and it does not seem to do a good job drying her nails.&lt;br /&gt;It takes way to long and she said it would have been better if it dried using a fan that way is much quicker she said this way using the lights to dry its just way to slow! I would have sent it back but returns trough mail is such a headache. Mark</li>
    <li> Great item she loved it!!</li>
    <li> I got the dryer in pink it works amazing I save money by doing my gel manicure myself. Only thing is my timer doesn&#x27;t work it just stays on but that&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and shipped fast..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it works great. However...I do NOT use it for shellac, I use it for regular polish after I paint my nails. So, I can&#x27;t tell you if it works great if you plan on using it with shellac.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Great deal love the color.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time and everything works great. Love the pink color!</li>
    <li> The lamp works fantastically and I have no problems with it at all.  it even came with the light bulb boxes so I know what ones to buy when I need to.</li>
    <li> You can leave your hands in for 120 or 180 secs but I find that this is not long enough for my normal gel to dry. If you put the switch between timings then it stays on which is pretty good. It takes about 15mins which is kind of long compared to other dryers but you get what you pay for and this is good enough for home use. If you find that the gel is not entirely dry then just take a swab with rubbing alcohol and wipe off the excess residue your gel should be perfectly dried after leaving it in for 10-15 mins depending on how much you used.</li>
    <li> A very good product.  For some reason, though, I was expecting it to have a fan, which helps cool the curing.  But, I&#x27;m very pleased after using this for a week now.</li>
    <li> Received it in good time for Christmas. My daughter went to use it and the plug was messed up. Wrote the company and they responded immediately. Sent them pictures of it and they sent me a new one right away and apologized for the inconvenience and I didn&#x27;t have to send them the old one back. I would buy from them again. Their customer service was great. The dryer works just like the salons. Love it!</li>
    <li> Originally had a light that only did one nail at a time... Problem Solved!!! Works great, quick and simple.</li>
    <li> This is my first time ever paying interest into a uv lamp. I normally just use regular polish but recently I bought gel polishes and came across the Salon Sundry. My first impression was; Its affordable and its in my favourite color! Definitely if it&#x27;s your first time I would recommend first watching youtube videos on how to use your light. If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing it can be messy. That doesn&#x27;t mean the uv light doesn&#x27;t work, you just need to use it properly and you will love the results!!</li>
    <li> I just received my lamp it&#x27;s cute,it&#x27;s pink but it&#x27;s not the right pink that is shown on the picture. it seems to work fine though so I&#x27;m going to keep it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this nail &amp;#34;dryer&amp;#34; does anything. It doesn&#x27;t blow air, it&#x27;s just a light that comes on. Did not make my nails dry any faster nor did I feel like there were any other changes that it made. I used it twice and nothing happened either time. Big waste of money... you would get the same results if you just let your nails air dry.</li>
    <li> I payed monay in rubbish... i recived it today,  plugged it and its blowed up 😡😡😡 how can I return my money back, or get new one?????????</li>
    <li> This is a Salon Edge product. Not what I wanted and they would not refund my money.</li>
    <li> Light works great! 2 mins with gel polish and it dries great!</li>
    <li> The dryer seems to work fine but it is made very cheaply. It works great for home use  but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for salon use. Too flimsy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this light as a beginner light for my nail business. It was a good light at a good price. It works just as well as the high priced professional lights. I recommend this light to anyone.</li>
    <li> Horrible.... cheap.... placed back in box for return after 15 min of opening. I will try and find something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;  Ms. Disappointed</li>
    <li> Worth every penny.  Used it today</li>
    <li> It was a gift.  As far as i know she liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> I just couldnt done anything better than buying this lamp.I looked around in stores and saw the little ones for about 40 dollars.I went online and found this one for 20smth dollars with free shipping.Honestly,my manucres costed me 60(using a gel),now im doing it myself,it looks great,lasts for a long time and with my busy life of having 3 kids and doing all homework myself,have been never able to keep my nails in order for more then 3 days.Really happy,would advise anybody to get it!</li>
    <li> I got this around christmas time in 2015 roughly around my birthday in Janurary I turned 15, it also came pretty quick and was well packed in the box. It works wonderfully I use it with my gel nail polish and it drys it to perfection.I also use it to quick dry my regular nail polish. It is very efficient and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take up doing their own nails or others</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
    <li> works great, It was much bigger than I thought so I was impressed by that and when I ordered it the delivery of it was fast. I will continue to use this product as I am quite pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift for Christmas. She is very happy with it. It&#x27;s working perfectly.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it works great and other times i still get smudges. To get it to work great I have to have a lot of time. If i&#x27;m in a rush, i get smudges.</li>
    <li> Ordered product for the wife and she loves it.  No longer do I have to wait for 2 hours while her nails dry to go somewhere.  She paints them and sticks her hand in the machine and WALLA!  they are dry and we are on our way.  Guys, get your gal this machine! It will save you lots of time and heated &amp;#34;discussions&amp;#34; about getting ready to go out.</li>
    <li> Works great! Beats paying $35.00 at the salon.  I love the fact that my nails are dry as soon as I&#x27;m finished. No worries about smudges or smearing.</li>
    <li> i love the dryer not hard to learn in how to use really easy it really does the work, if you have the time and want to save  some $$$ for those that love to get their nails done and love to change colors very often this is what you need.</li>
    <li> I knew thsi was a great product, as I have been able to use one that a friend owns. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> this machine does not do the job, I am not sure if I had to buy the nail polish from a beauty salon, but definitely it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with my dryer. Cures  my gel nails quickly and is saving me tons of money from going to the salon.  Just make sure you clean your nails afterwards or it will have a feel of sickness but goes away once you clean them.  It&#x27;s part of the process and is natural.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. Only 4 stars because I have to put a towel over the front when my hand is in it, due to the extremely bright light that emits from the device. But I have poor eyesight, sooo... This is a great thing to have if you use gel polish. The 180 seconds setting is what I used and it cured my gel polish in that timeframe. Like it, Like it alot.</li>
    <li> Its my first UV light I have ever used and I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Now im using uv gels more than polish and acrylic...&lt;br /&gt;It works great and came with the uv lights installed!!</li>
    <li> This product is very convenient when doing gel nails. It came with the four bulbs installed, but two were slack and had to be pushed into place. The product description says 2 plus pounds but it feels lighter than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this does a good job on curing gels, it does NOT dry nail polish. It helps, but it still takes time to get the regular polish dry. There are two settings on the back, one being 120 seconds and the other 180 seconds, but if you push that switch in the middle of these two options it will go to standard, in that it will shut off when you decide to shut it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of appearance, it is a nice glossy pink. It has enough space to hold any size hand comfortably......feet too.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a very good purchase, I would recommend......don&#x27;t forget to use some sunscreen folks!!! ;-)</li>
    <li> I love the nail dryer.  I received one and it was broken, the company sent out a new one and it works great!  The machine offers 2 time settings and an easy push on button.  I am now perfecting my gel nail polishing.</li>
    <li> Works bery good and drys nails quickly.  I recoomnt this product.  Have not had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I found this item to work extremely well, for the number times I have used it.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing it.  No more smudged nails after trying to wait hours for the 2nd coat the dry.</li>
    <li> It did not dry my nails, even after drying 3 times.  Waste of money, sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter&#x27;s nail  business ([...]).  She so loves it.  The fact that I could get it in pink makes her love it even more.</li>
    <li> I wanted to start doing my own no-chip mani, so I ordered this nail dryer. Pink is my favorite color, so I ordered it in pink. However, a black nail dryer was delivered instead. The seller was willing to work with me and accommodated me by shipping the pink dryer that I actually ordered after providing instructions on how to return the black dryer first. It looks a little darker than hot pink, but not much. It works very well and has two timers on the back, which is helpful if you want to change the length of time your nails are in the dryer. The dryer is light-weight and useful.</li>
    <li> Not really a review, more like advice on this product. I bought this a month ago but i think i might be doing something wrong because when i put my nails in to dry, it makes my nail polish coat wrinkled and damages my paint job. Also, a friend of mine who used it said, it made her nails yellow. If anyone has any advice or tips, PLEASE do let me know</li>
    <li> The product is as expected and was delivered before the expected delivery timeframe. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my gel nails turn out!  Overall, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not good at reviews.  I&#x27;ve used the nail dryer once, it worked great</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use with my shellac nail polish. It takes me one hour to cure my nails and still it does not fully dry. I am extremely disappointed with this product. It will work fine on normal nail polish but if you are looking for that same purpose then you might want to invest in something better.</li>
    <li> This lamp works great and drys nails fast.  I actually bought two for extra fast drying.  I did drop the unit and broke a light which was on hte expensive side to replace.</li>
    <li> Not sure the timer works very good on this one but didn&#x27;t want to return it. I just use a cookie timer.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my niece for her birthday and she is very happy with it so far. I will updated this review once she has used it several time and let me know what really thinks of the product, but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> After awhile it kind of burns your hand. Its not bad if you take a break between uses though. I&#x27;d buy it again but you could definitely find better ones.</li>
    <li> Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
    <li> Everyone that I do their nails always says how cute this light is. It does the job and I love the settings on the back.</li>
