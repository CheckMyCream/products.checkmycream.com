      <li>it&#x27;s my new favorite brand of lip gloss!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t bought lip glosses in a very very long time and this was a great buy.</li>

      <li>The price was right, and I like the color and shine, but the gloss leaks out of the container.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re thick, not sticky, and have a great cherry scent to them.  </li>
      <li>This gloss is more like pink glue.</li>
      <li>but The taste is very strange。</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very glossy</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>Then I add a light coat of gloss or a gold tint on the middle of the bottom lip</li>
      <li>Thanks for cooperating</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend NYX Mega Shine Lip Gloss to anyone who has an obsession with lip gloss but doesn&#x27;t want to pay a fortune.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical when I was ordering this lip gloss because it looked really pink, but it matched my lips perfectly!!</li>
      <li>My relative also selected this, said color was pretty.</li>
      <li>The gloss doesn&#x27;t last forever but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
      <li>have moved onto lip stains because they last so much longer.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a funky taste and lasts pretty long.</li>
      <li>I love nyx lipglosses but the bottles need a serious upgrade .</li>
      <li>this particular gloss (only one i&#x27;ve</li>
      <li>NYX cosmetics is only sold in Ulta Stores and theres only one here in NY and just too far for me to drive just for makeup stuff</li>

<li> Other than that, I can&#x27;t wait to try other shades!</li>
<li> 4 stars coz the color washed out on my dark lips.</li>
<li> Maybe as a top layer over a base lip stick.</li>
<li> Mine usually tend to crack at the opening.</li>
<li> I hate sticky gloss.</li>

    <li> Soft,pretty  and Simple  color . With  a Nice shine :)!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s  a  return buy  for me !</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffer!  My relative also selected this, said color was pretty.</li>
    <li> Nice color and shine but might be low quality. I don&#x27;t feel like putting it on too often. Maybe as a top layer over a base lip stick.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I was ordering this lip gloss because it looked really pink, but it matched my lips perfectly!! It has a nice cherry scent and has an angled brush which is genius! It&#x27;s also very glossy but it&#x27;s not sticky at all and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips. I was very surprised at how much I love it....it&#x27;s my new favorite brand of lip gloss!</li>
    <li> I love all NYX lipglosses, and both Tea Rosa and Beige are my go-to lip glosses.  They&#x27;re thick, not sticky, and have a great cherry scent to them.  They last a decent amount of time, and have great pigmentation.  I would highly recommend NYX Mega Shine Lip Gloss to anyone who has an obsession with lip gloss but doesn&#x27;t want to pay a fortune.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. 4 stars coz the color washed out on my dark lips. Stays for around 3-4 hours without eating.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too pink for me..was expecting a lighter pink. It doesn&#x27;t have a funky taste and lasts pretty long. I&#x27;d buy it again, in lighter shade. : )</li>
    <li> The price was right, and I like the color and shine, but the gloss leaks out of the container. I keep this lip gloss on my bathroom counter; I wouldn&#x27;t be able to carry it in my purse or pocket because there is something wrong with the seal between the vial and the cap. I probably would not buy this in the future.</li>
    <li> I love nyx lipglosses but the bottles need a serious upgrade . Mine usually tend to crack at the opening.</li>
    <li> Could be better, too much for 5 bucks. Don&#x27;t buy it, there are so many better lip glosses to invest in.</li>
    <li> the color is very beautiful. but The taste is very strange。</li>
    <li> This gloss is more like pink glue. I think you could stick to a wall after a coat of this junk.&lt;br /&gt;I have moved onto lip stains because they last so much longer. Then I add a light coat of gloss or a gold tint on the middle of the bottom lip so it pops!&lt;br /&gt;You do not want to be kissing anyone with this on.&lt;br /&gt;Just say no to anything with a wand to put it on. It will expire quicker and you risk infection before the three month mark putting this on your lips and sticking it back inside.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought lip glosses in a very very long time and this was a great buy. The color is a perfect deep pink. The gloss doesn&#x27;t last forever but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me. Try to be careful with the applicator and getting gloss on the rim, because it can make it sticky. Other than that, I can&#x27;t wait to try other shades!</li>
    <li> The color is prefect! It&#x27;s not too strong. Also this lip gloss is not sticky at all. That is my favorite part about it. I hate sticky gloss. This one is worth it</li>
    <li> good product with great price ... Thanks for cooperating</li>
    <li> This is a perfect color.</li>
    <li> omg this lipgloss is out of this world!!!  this particular gloss (only one i&#x27;ve tried)&lt;br /&gt;smells amazing, it smells like cherry/candy &amp; yumminess heaven all in one.&lt;br /&gt;the silky way it feels on ur lips is just aboutthe best feeling ever, very sleek...not&lt;br /&gt;sticky, greasy or waxy.  color is suttle &amp; very pretty!</li>
    <li> love the sweet candy scent as soon as I take the wand out. i like that its sheer but just enough to get that hint of color from the tube.&lt;br /&gt;if you are planning to let ur hair lose in a nice windy day, this ain&#x27;t the gloss to match with that. It&#x27;s super glossy, feels smooth on the lips none of that tacky like glue feel to it but anything that will fly in your face will definitely stick to your glossy lips.&lt;br /&gt;sucks NYX cosmetics is only sold in Ulta Stores and theres only one here in NY and just too far for me to drive just for makeup stuff hehehe. I&#x27;m glad to find it in Amazon to try the brand and I guess I will keep purchasing NYX through here until an Ulta store opens up in Brooklyn.</li>
