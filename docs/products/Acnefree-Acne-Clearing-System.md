      <li>Definitely recomente, one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IJ1PBK/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it works much better for me than Proactiv ever did.</li>
      <li>Absolutely satisfied with this product</li>
      <li>and i can say it,this product helps me alot with my acne,I love how my face feels after using it,i used proactive a year ago but this is the best i also can use it on my back and chest.</li>
      <li>I have gone through the pack for over a month now, my acne has not gone and I have more popping ever since</li>
      <li>Add to that a tendency to pick at any pimples I do get, and it&#x27;s better just to cut that nonsense off at the source,</li>
      <li>But I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re like me, you may also be better off using this product shirtless as to not get any on your shirt</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve experienced 2 new breakouts on my chin and between my eyebrows in this time.</li>
      <li>I will not be buying this product again, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone looking for a quick, working solution to their own acne.</li>
      <li>It work so good thanks Amazon you are truly from A-Z</li>
      <li>Personally I really liked the normal one, I have acne prone skin mostly on my chin and the normal version cleared it up great.</li>
      <li>and we already see a HUGE difference.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this system before and had AMAZING results but this time, not so much...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that is helping me win the acne battle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost two months now, and my moderate acne has shown great improvement.</li>
      <li>I am impressed it lasts so long though, you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
      <li>The system is amazing not harsh or drying.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t sweat, being gentle when washing your face but also thoroughly applying the medication, washing my hands often, and avoid touching my face.</li>
      <li>but I know how acne&lt;br /&gt;can upset u and how important is the review to help to choose the right product.</li>
      <li>I never do reviews for products and I have had mild acne on my forehead ever since I became a teenager.</li>
      <li>Works extremely quickly.</li>
      <li>so I purchased this and was amazed by how quickly it&#x27;s cleared my skin</li>
      <li>The most important thing to remember when using this product or any acne treatment product is to be patient and make sure you are consistent with your treatment, meaning using it every day during the times you are supposed to and following the directions (recommended steps 1,2,3 in the morning, steps 1,2,4 at night).</li>
      <li>Once your skin gets used to the benzoyl peroxide and the other products in the treatment package, you may be able to use more of it each time and maybe even more often but try not to irritate your skin too much.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s course and make your skin look great&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;so for the 1-2 months my forehead looked like the rocky mountains---not worth the embarrassment of the 1-2 months.</li>
      <li>Definitely a difference, enough to make me feel more comfortable in my own skin</li>
      <li>Acne didn&#x27;t dissapear completely, but my skin definatey became better.</li>
      <li>I live in a hot humid climate so my face tends to breakout more in the summer.</li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>In the beginning of use (the first 2 weeks) I didnt&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
      <li>Looked like it was all clearing up within the first week, but then &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; came and it all returned.</li>
      <li>I thought it will come up first</li>
      <li>I use the regular version most of the year and the Severe system during the summer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products.  </li>
      <li>ran out of the first two steps (cleanser and toner) after 5 or 6 months,</li>
      <li>and I noticed results after the first day of usage.</li>
      <li>At first you think it&#x27;s working</li>
      <li>And ordering from the comfort of my own home at half the price of a store adds to it.</li>
      <li>strongly suggest using a moisturizer after each time you use this product, especially one with SPF.</li>
      <li>Within 2 weeks of consistent use of the product, I saw significant decrease in the white and blackheads on my face.</li>
      <li>stuff really works, if you have out of control acne, cystic acne, or large oily pores, this stuff will work for you.</li>
      <li>It is very drying but that works for me because I have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>This dried my face out causing it to produce more oil and break out more than before, my cheeks, chin and upper lip.</li>
      <li>I know it sounds like a lot, but I&#x27;ve never had skin this oily with so much acne before - and I&#x27;m in my 30s.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be working very well for her.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars since results didn&#x27;t came up as fast</li>
      <li>I really wanted to have faith in this product, but I couldn&#x27;t just ignore the fact that it wasn&#x27;t doing much to help my skin.</li>
      <li>Use a towel you don&#x27;t mind turning orange and rinse very thoroughly.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin that is prone to redness and patches of dryness (while still being oily).&lt;br</li>
      <li>I decided to used them either way because I really needed something for my face.</li>
      <li>I got it really fast</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and it really cleared my face.</li>
      <li>I have tried every kind of skin care you can think of for the past 10 years and nothing has worked like this kit has.</li>
      <li>It is a bit drying though on my older skin, but adding a moisturizer about 20 minutes after either step 3 or step 4 counteracts that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried creams, oral medication, masks, home remedies, just about everything I can think of to help, and my skin looked better in only one week using this product, following the suggested regimen for the kit</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product although I didn&#x27;t buy it from amazon</li>
      <li>I highly suggest trying it.</li>
      <li>The rest of my blemishes have been normal whiteheads and blackheads, and those too appear to be fewer.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend giving this a try if you haven&#x27;t found the right solution for you.</li>
      <li>I think right now though my skin is finally clearing up</li>
      <li>This the only topical product the was effective for me, I suffer from cystic acne long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I think it has to do with the fact that I have been more frequently weight lifting heavy and running farther which has caused a testosterone boost; the increased libido is another give away.</li>
      <li>Made my face break out more then usual.</li>
      <li>So I bought this system at the store and WOW!</li>
      <li>but I remembered it did the same thing to me the first time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really good it clears up my skin i have a far lot less fewer breakouts. It took a few weeks for my skin to get used to it but once it did it took to it like a fish to water.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. I will not buy it again. It did not help clear me up and I have resulted back to basic products.</li>
    <li> Product was already expired when i received it  cost more for me to return it so I&#x27;ll count that as a loss. . Still tried it for a week and it did nothing for me!</li>
    <li> It was delivered on time.  Great!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Works extremely quickly. I have acne prone skin and sometimes due to a change in diet, weather, stress (who knows), I get bad breakouts.. so I purchased this and was amazed by how quickly it&#x27;s cleared my skin.. in a few days, you can feel a difference and I haven&#x27;t had any more breakout since using it. I&#x27;d say it works much better for me than Proactiv ever did.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.</li>
    <li> This product is the very best in acne skin care I have found. I&#x27;m now in my early 30s and for about the past 5 years my face has just started to explode with pimples. Too me it has to be stress because in my younger years I never had any sort of acne problems. This product has definitely saved me from the embarassing pimples that seem to happen overnight. I have to make sure to use it twice a day or little pimples will begin to develop which can be annoying, but they usually only become red dots instead of full white heads. If you have tried other products or are paying too much for medicated creams then try this facewash and skincare out.</li>
    <li> This acne kit is a weird one. At first you think it&#x27;s working but after a couple of days I got an increase in breakouts. I was disappointed</li>
    <li> This is the only over the counter medication I use that works almost immediately. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and I don&#x27;t have break outs.</li>
    <li> GOOD VALUE, GOOD PRODUCT</li>
    <li> It seemed to work a little at first but then just stopped working....</li>
    <li> The item was opened when i recipe the package</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as it should</li>
    <li> I am disappointed. Exp is 7/2015. This means i have only 2 and half of month to use. Amazon sent me an old and nearly expired product</li>
    <li> I received my package and was VERY disappointed to find out it came with incorrect content inside. It should have a step 1, 2 and 3 but instead came with TWO step ones and NO step 2 product, which means the products are useless to me now. Really frustrating.</li>
    <li> Terrible I got it 2 days before it was expired!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The last step is retinol or something and it brings out my acne even worse. Think the first 3 steps are the way to go instead---not the last one with retinol--probably would have worked if I didn&#x27;t mind looking like zit face for a while but I didn&#x27;t want to go through that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think retinol takes like 1-2 months to run it&#x27;s course and make your skin look great&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;so for the 1-2 months my forehead looked like the rocky mountains---not worth the embarrassment of the 1-2 months.</li>
    <li> The only thing that i&#x27;ve found that actually works on my severely oily, adult acne skin.  I&#x27;ve tried so many different products.  My routine is a makeup remover wipe, Noxema, Dr. Sponge , Witch Hazel as an astringent a few times per week and then this stuff.  I know it sounds like a lot, but I&#x27;ve never had skin this oily with so much acne before - and I&#x27;m in my 30s.  I  also use a clay mask 1 - 2 per week.  I like Dr. Jart Pore Clarifying Mask and Marcelle clay mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I dont work for any of these companies or any beauty supply or salon.  Just sharing what I finally found works for me after years of trying different products</li>
    <li> Absolutely satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> excelllent trreatment!</li>
    <li> Im a guy and i can say it,this product helps me alot with my acne,I love how my face feels after using it,i used proactive a year ago but this is the best i also can use it on my back and chest.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after trying out Proactiv x-out (which worked, but burned my skin in the process) and after realizing that Clearasil products were helping, but not quite doing the trick. This one may be the most disappointing and unsatisfying treatment cream I&#x27;ve tried so far. 2 weeks in, and I&#x27;m not seeing results. In fact, I&#x27;ve experienced 2 new breakouts on my chin and between my eyebrows in this time. I really wanted to have faith in this product, but I couldn&#x27;t just ignore the fact that it wasn&#x27;t doing much to help my skin. I have at least 3 major acne spots on my face and chest, and AcneFree&#x27;s cream just hasn&#x27;t been able to do it for me. I will not be buying this product again, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone looking for a quick, working solution to their own acne.</li>
    <li> Works every bit as good as proactiv.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars since results didn&#x27;t came up as fast I thought it will come up first</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for a couple of months and am very happy with the results!  I didn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;severe&amp;#34; acne to begin with but the past year or so have been having consistent little breakouts with the occasional monster blemish popping up. I tried all the acne facial products out there and it was always a waste of money.  But my skin has been SO much better since using this!</li>
    <li> I have adult acne. Got it in my thirties and it sucks. I&#x27;ve tried every topical, every antibiotic, and every anti acne product know to man. When I decided to stop Accutane (Which by the way worst internal and external side effects ive ever had.) after only three months with no results I was devastated. I bought this without having the highest hopes. Only been using it a week (in conjunction with the anti-acne illumask).  I see results. Acne-free is working. The system is amazing not harsh or drying. Give it a try if you suffer from cystic acne. It&#x27;s the only thing that is helping me win the acne battle. I will post with an update but so far...I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this system before and had AMAZING results but this time, not so much... First off, I&#x27;m not sure if my kit has issues or what. It was open (no tape) upon receiving and it smells pretty weird. Like I said, I&#x27;ve used it before (purchased from walmart/target) and it didn&#x27;t smell funky like this one does. Perhaps mine is expired or contaminated?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, my face has cleared up ZERO percent since using it... Either the formula is changed or mine is a bad batch...</li>
    <li> I was shopping about a month ago at my local Dollar Tree, when I noticed they had this there. I purchased two. Boy am I kicking myself. THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT HAS WORKED!! WHILE I AM ALSO POSITIVE PROACTIVE would be as effective its far too expensive. I highly suggest trying it. At $1 each kit  I&#x27;m mad I didn&#x27;t buy them all. But I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found to keep my skin clear. I have tried other products and always come back to this one. It is a bit drying though on my older skin, but adding a moisturizer about 20 minutes after either step 3 or step 4 counteracts that.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a couple of years back and it worked and cleared my skin. I got too comfortable with the results and started using other products and all of my acne came back again.So I repurchased it and once again it has cleared my skin up. I have no pimples, barely any blackheads left and the only thing I really have on my face that I don&#x27;t like is my large pores.I find the key to this stuff working is being consistent and giving it time to actually work as well as using a facial wash cloth to wipe off step 1 instead of just rinsing it off with water. I know some people say it worked for them in like 2 weeks but honestly it took me about 2 months for my skin to get to this point. When I first started using it my face actually broke out even worse and it made me want to throw the whole kit in the garbage but I remembered it did the same thing to me the first time. It is very drying but that works for me because I have very oily skin. All and all in my experience it&#x27;s like skin crack. Stop using it and you can say welcome to pimple galore,but, it does keep skin clear if used consistently at least for me.</li>
    <li> This worked great tried many products before and nothing gave me results as this did.</li>
    <li> Personally I really liked the normal one, I have acne prone skin mostly on my chin and the normal version cleared it up great. For some reason I thought I would be doing my self a favor buying the stronger kind. Not at all. This dried my face out causing it to produce more oil and break out more than before, my cheeks, chin and upper lip.</li>
    <li> The most important thing to remember when using this product or any acne treatment product is to be patient and make sure you are consistent with your treatment, meaning using it every day during the times you are supposed to and following the directions (recommended steps 1,2,3 in the morning, steps 1,2,4 at night). Once your skin gets used to the benzoyl peroxide and the other products in the treatment package, you may be able to use more of it each time and maybe even more often but try not to irritate your skin too much. I&#x27;ve been using this treatment for about two months now and it’s been a roller coaster ride. The first month and a half was really frustrating for me because this treatment was clearing up 2 to 3 acne at a time but 3 to 4 acne was emerging somewhere else on my face (one step forward, two steps back results). It has been especially difficult for me since I am deployed in the Middle East where it is very hot and access to good acne products is severely limited. I think right now though my skin is finally clearing up and hopefully it will continue to clear up this way. Some other tips that helped me out was washing my face immediately after sweating a lot, staying cool so I don&#x27;t sweat, being gentle when washing your face but also thoroughly applying the medication, washing my hands often, and avoid touching my face. I am also taking ClearZine pills (you can buy it on amazon) and doxycycline pills along with this treatment which I think is helping out. Don&#x27;t know if this is the best acne treatment out there but it’s been working for me. Hope this helps and let me know if you have any questions.</li>
    <li> Having acne as an adult is ridiculous and annoying. I&#x27;ve always wanted to use those designer face care systems like Este Lauder or Clinique like my friends, but all that stuff ever does is make me breakout. I started buying Acnefree in the local drugstores for around $20 and then I found it on amazon for half the price. I use the regular version most of the year and the Severe system during the summer. I live in a hot humid climate so my face tends to breakout more in the summer. This stronger version of Acnefree has 10% benzoil peroxide, so not only does it clear you up, it keeps you clear. I have very oily skin and haven&#x27;t had any of the &amp;#34;dry skin&amp;#34; problems that other people have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works, if you have out of control acne, cystic acne, or large oily pores, this stuff will work for you. For mild acne or for basic maintenance, try the regular version of Acnefree in the white bottles.</li>
    <li> It work so good thanks Amazon you are truly from A-Z</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely helping. I think I just have really deep stuff in my pores. Can notice difference in hyper pigmentation already in about a week though and my face is pretty bad</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, defiantly don&#x27;t see any improvement on face</li>
    <li> This is the only solution that works consistently for me, and I am so grateful to have found it. I regularly order this product and plan to continue doing so for years to come.</li>
    <li> Definitely recomente, one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Helped me a lot.</li>
    <li> Recently, in my early-30s, I have been getting pimples on my forehead for the last few months. While I do have semi-oily skin it wasn&#x27;t this bad previously. I think it has to do with the fact that I have been more frequently weight lifting heavy and running farther which has caused a testosterone boost; the increased libido is another give away. I tried using a few face washes and whatnot, but nothing was really working. Although, cream Neosporin did help once a pimple formed, it didn&#x27;t help prevent them too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, since I had good results with this stuff in my mid-20s I decided to give it another shot and I noticed results after the first day of usage. After two weeks of using it about 75% of the time, while all of my pimples are not totally gone, they are definitely reduced in number, are smaller, and go away more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that I still use cream based Neosporin as well, so this product is not the sole reason for the improvement, but this product definitely helped improve things.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter used this product and there was a noticeable improvement in just a few days.  The product cost much less than what she had been using and really helped.</li>
    <li> Acne didn&#x27;t dissapear completely, but my skin definatey became better.</li>
    <li> This the only topical product the was effective for me, I suffer from cystic acne long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every thing on the market that u can imagine proactive, murad and other. My acne probably is hormonal, as I&lt;br /&gt;got cystic breakout 2 times each cycle. I highly recommend this product although I didn&#x27;t buy it from amazon but I know how acne&lt;br /&gt;can upset u and how important is the review to help to choose the right product. In the beginning of use (the first 2 weeks) I didnt&lt;br /&gt;note improvement but after a month there was no breakout completely disappeared. It doesn&#x27;t over dry ur skin like proactive and other product do.</li>
    <li> Definitely a difference, enough to make me feel more comfortable in my own skin but my skin isn&#x27;t clear or close to it.</li>
    <li> Great. Saves about $25 versus buying in drugstore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about acne products because I had very little relief when using Proactive. Well this stuff is NOT Proactive. Within 2 weeks of consistent use of the product, I saw significant decrease in the white and blackheads on my face. It is very strong and can cause you to peel so I stopped the nightly routine for a week before starting back. I am very pleased with my results!</li>
    <li> I have gone through the pack for over a month now, my acne has not gone and I have more popping ever since</li>
    <li> Looked like it was all clearing up within the first week, but then &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; came and it all returned. Dries the skin and burns around the eyes, so do not put more than a thin layer of the creams. Not a complete waste of money though.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Cheaper than when I would buy it at Walgreens for $30.00! I have used this product for over 2 years and it works great.</li>
    <li> Best at clearing acne. Period!</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing!!! i&#x27;ve been using it about two weeks now and my face have never looked better! i am so happy. its not easy living with acne.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 7 months now and I plan to keep using it. I have tried every kind of skin care you can think of for the past 10 years and nothing has worked like this kit has. I have very oily skin that is prone to redness and patches of dryness (while still being oily).&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of my acne entirely, but it is noticeably better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of the first two steps (cleanser and toner) after 5 or 6 months, so I do wish there was a way to only buy the steps you need because, at this rate, I am going to end up with a collection of  unused steps 3 and 4. I am impressed it lasts so long though, you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot. I use maybe a dime size amount of the cleanser, just enough of the toner to wet  a cotton ball, and only small dabs of the last two (less than the size of a pea).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very sensitive skin or aren&#x27;t used to using products with benzoyl peroxide in them, this may be a bit irritating to use. (I think they do have a sensitive skin formula, I haven&#x27;t tried it). I&#x27;ve been using benzoyl peroxide for years and this doesn&#x27;t bother me except around my temples so I just don&#x27;t use it there. Just a side note, the benxoyl peroxide WILL STAIN EVERYTHING so be careful with it. Use a towel you don&#x27;t mind turning orange and rinse very thoroughly. If you&#x27;re like me, you may also be better off using this product shirtless as to not get any on your shirt either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest using a moisturizer after each time you use this product, especially one with SPF. This is my favorite: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IJ1PBK/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost two months now, and my moderate acne has shown great improvement. I&#x27;ve tried creams, oral medication, masks, home remedies, just about everything I can think of to help, and my skin looked better in only one week using this product, following the suggested regimen for the kit exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some dryness, but I use a moisturizer every other night or so, sometimes petroleum jelly for specific dry spots with peeling (this extent of dryness hasn&#x27;t been common for me, mainly &amp;#34;user error&amp;#34; from using too much of step 3). I don&#x27;t put anything additional on my face until all steps in the kit are complete and my face is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no cystic acne since I started with Acnefree, and maybe two or three bad zits (it&#x27;s hard to remember since for once, it&#x27;s an infrequent event!). The rest of my blemishes have been normal whiteheads and blackheads, and those too appear to be fewer. My scarring is clearing up, although overall this product isn&#x27;t doing much for discoloration (not that it promised to do so). I&#x27;d love a good recommendation for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not work for everyone, but after years of searching for something that works for me, I&#x27;ve found it! I would definitely recommend giving this a try if you haven&#x27;t found the right solution for you.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works great. And ordering from the comfort of my own home at half the price of a store adds to it.</li>
    <li> I got it really fast but when I opened it the box was open and then I checked all the products and they were open too! Except for the retinol cream. I decided to used them either way because I really needed something for my face. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and it really cleared my face. I use the retinol cream during the day and the benzoyl one at night because it drys my face out. I&#x27;m really happy that I&#x27;m thinking to buy it again but with another seller.</li>
    <li> My daughter has terrible acne and we were just about to spend $50 on that product advertised on TV when I came across this on Amazon.  She has been using it now for about a week and we already see a HUGE difference.  The pimples are shrinking and her skin is clearing up.  Seems to be working very well for her.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since late 2010, in my late 20&#x27;s. While I don&#x27;t have horrendous acne, I am an adult and having acne as an adult blows. Add to that a tendency to pick at any pimples I do get, and it&#x27;s better just to cut that nonsense off at the source, right? So I bought this system at the store and WOW! It seriously starts working in days. I don&#x27;t often use the night cream often but the rest of it I do. I should probably use the night cream though...it smells like it has cocoa butter, which is good for healing any scars or discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, my skin is oily/combination and only a little sensitive. This product doesn&#x27;t bug my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I just found this stuff on sale here on Amazon and I loaded up :D Saves me a trip to the store and a chunk of change!</li>
    <li> I never do reviews for products and I have had mild acne on my forehead ever since I became a teenager. This stuff works and it literally works over night. Literally in one day you&#x27;ll see changes in 3-5 days it completely clears up the acne (at least for me it does). I&#x27;ve been using this product for 8 months now.</li>
    <li> It has worked for keeping zits away but,Not white or black heads.Bummed out about it.....</li>
    <li> This product was not for me. Made my face break out more then usual.</li>
</ol>
