<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have worn Flower by Kenzo for over ten years... it is a soft powdery scent that is not overpowering...  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> *I heard about this scent two years ago while working CCS for Commerce Bank and after assisting a customer from New York who was the buyer for Nordstram&#x27;s Fragrance she informed me to watch for this scent to come out. I since retired and then upon seeing it at Sephora on Amazon I couldn&#x27;t wait to smell it. I am on my second bottle of it and it is lightweight, feminine, not overwhelming and just sexy.</li>
    <li> This is the best fragance ever produced. Whenever i wear it i always gets compliments from people that i work with and people that walk by me. It is such a sweet fragance to wear anytime of the day. I defintely would recommend it to every woman that loves to smell good and get compliments for it.</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of schedule, came with a body lotion and pouch. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume of all times.  It actually smells like real flowers.&lt;br /&gt;J</li>
    <li> When I received this product, the plastic covering the perfume cardboard box was broken. Besides, the cardboard box had many parts that seemed to be cut off (as when you try to take off the price or the serial number). I am not sure why. The other point is that the smell goes really quick, I have seen some comments posting the same. I am really concerned, because this characteristics are found in fake perfumes. And the seller was AMAZON, not any small online seller.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!! It has become my signature scent. People know when I&#x27;ve been around. I agree with the other reviewers, you can&#x27;t over do it with this wonderful scent. It is truly my all time favorite!! Not many people know about it. Men and women always stop and ask me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing. Great for receiving compliments!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  Leary of the cost and quality but it appears to be the real deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my best friend and she loves it!</li>
    <li> A favorite. Light, flowery, sweet. lasts all day. Tremendous savings with Amazon for this, a lot more in stores. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!! I&#x27;ve had other Kenzo perfumes in the past but it is the first time I have this one. I smelled it in a magazine and am glad I decided to finally buy it. I had mixed feelings about this purchase because other reviews say that it smells like baby powder but I liked what I smelled in the magazine and decided to buy it. I LOVE the smell and my guess is that some people didn&#x27;t like it because they just don&#x27;t like this type of perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me perfumes are very personal and my personal taste varies according to the person&#x27;s age, the season, the time of the day, and what will you do while you wear it... go to work, go on a date at night, go to a party, etc. I am 37 years old, like light and floral perfumes for during the day. I recommend this product to any woman who likes the same.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is subtle and pleasant.  It has a slight flower scent mixed with slight citrus and musk.  Really nice for day or night.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful fragrance. I always get compliments when I am wearing it. As usual, the price on Amazon was great, and I got it in a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely perfume sensitive and have found Kenzo-Flower to be the only fragrance I can tolerate. I agree with all of the great reviews...I am totally in love with this product.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it. It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but aren&#x27;t they all?</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!!! It&#x27;s a great deal</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom for her birthday. She previously had this same perfume but ran out so I decided to buy a replacement. I looked for it at the mall but had no luck. So I checked it out here. The perfume came in the mail about three days after I ordered it using the super saver shipping(four days before they estimated it :) so that made me really happy. I was worried that the smell of the perfume is going to be different from what she originally had. So I opened it up and compared the two scents. They are absolutely the same and the bottle also looks absolutely the same. I read some reviews on here and was really hesitant, but after reading the good ones I decided to order anyway.  If you know the product and had it before buy it here with no worries. All that is left is to wrap it up.</li>
    <li> I read on the internet of this perfume, which had won as best female fragrance in a ime occasion so I wanted to buy it, the smell is wonderful as subtle as a baby&#x27;s touch, smells delicious delicate scent, I love to ...</li>
    <li> I cannot stop smelling myself whenever I wear my Kenzo!!!  It just smells so soft and sexy and men go crazy whenever I wear it!!!  I cannot keep enough of it on hand because I wear so much of it.  I try to keep the purse size on hand at all times.  I received it packaged brand new but was a little disappointed it took the entire 5 days to receive it but I was just impatient not because of the seller...;)</li>
    <li> Kenzo is the only brand of cologne I can wear because my spouse&#x27;s and my allageries. Plus I am always receiving compliments on my perfume!  I wear Kenzo Flower, Kenzo Parfum D Ete and Kenzo Summmer. Love them all!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t compare to retail purchases and even went to store and bought a bottle. There is no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;This is more like a watered down fake.</li>
