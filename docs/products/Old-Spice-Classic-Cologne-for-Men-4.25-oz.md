### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great stuff!</li>
      <li>This is one the best cologne sprays that I have.</li>
      <li>Thought this smelled great!</li>
      <li>Those items are perfectly serviceable, if unspectacular, stressing the citrus note of the fragrance.</li>
      <li>smells awesome.</li>
      <li>so Amazon was a great way to go.</li>
      <li>He was happy to receive it of course and uses as often he feels he needs to on occasion.</li>
      <li>Great aroma; great blend.  </li>
      <li>Im gonna need more!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually a very nice scent.</li>
      <li>Soul too, shares some amber and musk in its drydown and, while not the world&#x27;s greatest fragrance, is infinitely better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After a minute or two, the uber-synthetic quality abates, and you get a pleasant grapefruit smell.</li>
      <li>Stick with the original!!!</li>
      <li>this stuff makes pirates smell good.</li>
      <li>It is a good product at a good price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll go ahead and say it, the stuff smells good.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is good to use during summer and fall (in my opinion)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice when you walk into work and one of your coworkers says who smells so damn good and everyone else points At you.</li>
      <li>This has a most pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>This sent is amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice and affordable, arrived promptly and was packaged well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>once I have had the event of a girl catching the sent, while turning to her friend and asking her to smell it too.</li>
      <li>pros: nice smell,</li>
      <li>Not quite as nice smelling as the deoderant.</li>
      <li>I save the fancy stuff for going out, this is perfect for normal use.</li>
      <li>The spray nozzle is good enough, and dispenses a perfect amount with a couple sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I love this stuff and others have commented how nice it smells on me.</li>
      <li>As for myself I do not mind the spray top and the wolf thorn scent is amazing.</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>I hoped for more.  </li>
      <li>I love this cologne.</li>
      <li>in hopes of it smelling more like the body spray.</li>
      <li>I like this cologne spray way better than the body spray alternative.</li>
      <li>Nor, can I truthfully recommended.</li>
      <li>smells like more alcohol in it...</li>
      <li>I love the smell when he wears it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
      <li>I love the Wolfthorn scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not entirely terrible</li>
      <li>always on the top shelf for everyone to see.&lt;br /&gt;Never really liked the original aroma, but it was hip to have.</li>
      <li>Dont waist your money and get the original!</li>
      <li>Smells great and nicely matches the body wash and deodorant of the same name.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not always easy to find</li>
      <li>It smells great, and I love it after I shower from a long hot spirited walk.  </li>
      <li>it smells cheap and the bottle is no longer glass</li>
      <li>Initially, these smell remarkably like those found in cleaning products.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m not what would be considered the &amp;#34;manliest&amp;#34; of guys, I was looking forward to what I loved as the Wolfthorn deodorant, however you would never have thought that they&#x27;d have the same name regarding their scent alone.</li>
      <li>As a guy I wouldn&#x27;t think much it but more than</li>
      <li>you must use this with the body wash and body spray for the full effect.</li>
      <li>This cologhn is good and smells just like the wolfthrone body wash but the smell of it dose not last on the humen body</li>
      <li>Not bad,</li>
      <li>The cologne has a fresh clean scent to it.</li>
      <li>&quot; There are so many better things to be had (albeit in smaller quantities) at this price point.</li>
      <li>But, as quickly as it arrived, it vanishes, replaced by the \\&quot;manly\\&quot; aspects of the fragrance, which consist of amber and musk notes.</li>
      <li>But really, is cologne really for my own pleasure or for somebody else?</li>
      <li>The good news is that, beyond the first 30 mins or so, the fragrance is purely a skin scent, so innocent bystanders need not be afflicted by the wet dog shampoo assault.</li>
      <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t last long, but sure smells great.</li>
      <li>think this worth buying, regardless of the cons.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Has a distinct aroma.....</li>
      <li>and it also clearly has a spray top in the picture.</li>
      <li>Nothing better than Old Spice, and</li>
      <li>Good amount of cologne, has a minty, sharp smell.</li>
      <li>other than that I loved it</li>
      <li>I bought this cologne spray thinking that it&#x27;d have a candy sweet type of smell like the deodorant does; however it smells absolutely nothing like it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect much from fragrances costing so little, no grand symphony of fragrance notes nor the most natural smelling versions either, just a happy, pleasant, and good-smelling fragrance.</li>
      <li>As I said, it smells good... but its closer to the old school classic Old Spice scent than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Product quality and the most timeless vintage image&lt;br /&gt;for real men, shame about the Old Spice product is not sold in France.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Rarely does my wife say much about my aftershave.</li>
      <li>So, I love the smell of their Wolfthorn deodorant and figured, hey, why not get some cologne in the same scent.</li>
      <li>Have gotten many female compliments.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this &#x27;new&#x27; Old Spice.</li>
      <li>It is still a traditional product, yet somewhat different, and appealing to one&#x27;s sense of smell, &#x27;cause it is somewhat unique!</li>
      <li>but I prefer the original Old Spice.</li>
      <li>I wanted a spray in the original Old Spice.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;4.25 ounces of cologne should last a good long while, so the price seems about right.  </li>
      <li>Got a compliment from a young woman waiting on me at a restaurant -- &amp;#34;Ooh, you smell good.&amp;#34;  The spray bottle is much better than the old &amp;#34;plug&amp;#34; you had to pull out and replace.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall good cologne, but I will be trying a different scent from the collection next time...</li>
      <li>I frankly can&#x27;t take it, but I am actually allergic to strong cologne or perfume smell,</li>
      <li>To me is smells clean and crisp, almost like Irish Spring body wash</li>
      <li>no  matter how much you spray on</li>
      <li>so who really cared?&lt;br</li>
      <li>Real cooool.....</li>
      <li>I really dig the Wolfthorn Body Spray, but this doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it.  </li>
      <li>As high school kids we always kept the original Old Spice in our lockers in High school.</li>
      <li>Old spice did their R and D right on this one.</li>
      <li>Now on the other hand, this stuff has an outstanding contempory scent.</li>
      <li>No burn like so many other alcohol based colognes.</li>
      <li>I happen to not like this scent at all, however it is wearable enough that my nose can live just fine.</li>
      <li>The fragrance opens with citrus notes, mainly grapefruit.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like classic.</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s for an older generation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not 100 sure that the people giving this a one star rating should even be writing reviews because it&#x27;s obviously a spray bottle from what it says in the description of the item in bold black lettering</li>
      <li>This was gift to my son for the holidays whom likes the scent of this particular cologne brand.</li>
      <li>This is less candy like and more your normal Axe smell.</li>
      <li>I think the price is comparable to what I&#x27;d normally pay.</li>
      <li>Hadn&#x27;t used this stuff since I was a teenager in the 60s but decided to try some of the new scents.</li>
      <li>not your normal Old Spice.</li>
      <li>This is not your grandfather&#x27;s Old Spice!</li>
      <li>I buy Old Spice often</li>
      <li>This Old Spice smells like that orange cleaner.</li>

    <li> pros: nice smell, scent stays 2~3 hours&lt;br /&gt;cons: doesn&#x27;t look like 4.25 (actually looks small)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this worth buying, regardless of the cons.&lt;br /&gt;This is good to use during summer and fall (in my opinion)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll go ahead and say it, the stuff smells good.  To me is smells clean and crisp, almost like Irish Spring body wash (in my opinion).  I really dig the Wolfthorn Body Spray, but this doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it.  As I said, it smells good... but its closer to the old school classic Old Spice scent than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.25 ounces of cologne should last a good long while, so the price seems about right.  I&#x27;m sure it seems like a ridiculous gripe, but I hate the cheap plastic bottle it comes in.  I miss the old glass or porcelain high quality bottles of the past.  The spray nozzle is good enough, and dispenses a perfect amount with a couple sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good cologne, but I will be trying a different scent from the collection next time... in hopes of it smelling more like the body spray.</li>
    <li> It is still a traditional product, yet somewhat different, and appealing to one&#x27;s sense of smell, &#x27;cause it is somewhat unique!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought this for me and she loves how it makes me smell!.</li>
    <li> I receiver this in a white elephant sale along with deodorant and body wash. Those items are perfectly serviceable, if unspectacular, stressing the citrus note of the fragrance. The edc, however, is not good at all. I don&#x27;t expect much from fragrances costing so little, no grand symphony of fragrance notes nor the most natural smelling versions either, just a happy, pleasant, and good-smelling fragrance. Unfortunately, Wolfthorn falls well short of even this standard. The fragrance opens with citrus notes, mainly grapefruit. Initially, these smell remarkably like those found in cleaning products. After a minute or two, the uber-synthetic quality abates, and you get a pleasant grapefruit smell. But, as quickly as it arrived, it vanishes, replaced by the \\&quot;manly\\&quot; aspects of the fragrance, which consist of amber and musk notes. These, unfortunately, are really bad, sometimes reminding me of the smell of wet dog during a doggie shampoo, a harsh mixture of harsh and artificial sweet elements mixed with animalic musky notes. This pairing is, presumably, backs the \\&quot;for nocturnal creatures\\&quot; copy on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two notes never really evolve beyond their initial appearance, they just slowly fade away. The good news is that, beyond the first 30 mins or so, the fragrance is purely a skin scent, so innocent bystanders need not be afflicted by the wet dog shampoo assault. As a skin scent, it does last awhile, I could still smell it about 4 hours into my \\&quot;fragrance journey.\\&quot; There are so many better things to be had (albeit in smaller quantities) at this price point. For instance, two 0.5 oz bottle of Soul, a Liz Claiborne Curve scent, can be had for about the same money. Soul too, shares some amber and musk in its drydown and, while not the world&#x27;s greatest fragrance, is infinitely better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Stick to the original Old Spice, which is quite nice, but avoid its ugly stepchildren, like Wolfthorn.</li>
    <li> This has a most pleasant scent. It&#x27;s refreshing. The ladies can&#x27;t help but like it!</li>
    <li> Thought this smelled great! We are 50+. I don&#x27;t like classic. I think that&#x27;s for an older generation. This was a spray. I buy Old Spice often and it&#x27;s not always easy to find so Amazon was a great way to go. I think the price is comparable to what I&#x27;d normally pay.</li>
    <li> Rarely does my wife say much about my aftershave. As high school kids we always kept the original Old Spice in our lockers in High school. Real cooool.....always on the top shelf for everyone to see.&lt;br /&gt;Never really liked the original aroma, but it was hip to have. Of course, in 1963 the only other choice was Aqua Velva or Old English so who really cared?&lt;br /&gt; Now on the other hand, this stuff has an outstanding contempory scent. It lasts all day and I have gotten several favorful comments. You will not be disappointed ..... This is not your grandfather&#x27;s Old Spice! A little goes a long way. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Love it..only bad thing is that it came without a box :( other than that I loved it</li>
    <li> I like this cologne spray way better than the body spray alternative. The body spray can nozzle seems to clog when I store it in a drawer on it&#x27;s side due to its height. This little sprayer, however, doesn&#x27;t clog. Additionally, the scent is slightly less &amp;#34;disco-disco bubblegum candy&amp;#34; than the body spray. It&#x27;s actually a very nice scent.</li>
    <li> Has a distinct aroma.....not your normal Old Spice. Fruity, but woodsy scent. No burn like so many other alcohol based colognes.</li>
    <li> Just got my package today. I love this cologne. Although, The box was half opened. It smelled for miles away it seemed. The bottle leaked inside the package and its all anyone can smell now.. Other then that the product is just as shown. smells awesome.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way this smells..it smells cheap and the bottle is no longer glass..I wish I had a sample before i got it</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the deodorant. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but I think the scent was misleading.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. It is a good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Im gonna need more!! This is the only scent I like!</li>
    <li> Husband likes because I like.</li>
    <li> Never seen this in the store. This is one the best cologne sprays that I have. Have gotten many female compliments.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne spray thinking that it&#x27;d have a candy sweet type of smell like the deodorant does; however it smells absolutely nothing like it. It doesn&#x27;t smell like Axe like someone else mentioned; however it does smell like pretty much every other generic cologne out there. Since I&#x27;m not what would be considered the &amp;#34;manliest&amp;#34; of guys, I was looking forward to what I loved as the Wolfthorn deodorant, however you would never have thought that they&#x27;d have the same name regarding their scent alone.</li>
    <li> Annual gift to my husband.  I love the smell when he wears it.  He has used this for over 25 years!</li>
    <li> Product quality and the most timeless vintage image&lt;br /&gt;for real men, shame about the Old Spice product is not sold in France.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cordially&lt;br /&gt;Michel</li>
    <li> I wanted a spray in the original Old Spice.  I dont like it and its in a plastic bottle.  Dont waist your money and get the original!</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t used this stuff since I was a teenager in the 60s but decided to try some of the new scents. I like them. Got a compliment from a young woman waiting on me at a restaurant -- &amp;#34;Ooh, you smell good.&amp;#34;  The spray bottle is much better than the old &amp;#34;plug&amp;#34; you had to pull out and replace.  Try it again.</li>
    <li> I remember the Old Spice my father would wear, I brought this for my son and he refuses to use it, I feel that I spent my money on this product. My suggestion to Old Spice is to bring back the old fragrance, but this will be the last time that I buy this product. Nor, can I truthfully recommended.</li>
    <li> This is just a smelly product with no particular advantage over another smelly product.  I hoped for more.  Years ago, Old Spice stop making a terrific after-shave called Burly.  Great aroma; great blend.  Their biggest mistake.  They should bring it back.  I was hoping this would be that aroma or at least close.&lt;br /&gt;Not remotely close....</li>
    <li> This sent is amazing. As a guy I wouldn&#x27;t think much it but more than once I have had the event of a girl catching the sent, while turning to her friend and asking her to smell it too. In result, I&#x27;m awkwardly standing there as I have two girls place their faces close to my body. I&#x27;ve gotten a bit use to this happening now. Old spice did their R and D right on this one.</li>
    <li> Smells just like the deodorant Wolfthorn in my opinion, would recommend to purchase this. will purchase again with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> I happen to not like this scent at all, however it is wearable enough that my nose can live just fine. I usually don&#x27;t even notice it anymore after 5 seconds. But really, is cologne really for my own pleasure or for somebody else? In my case, its that somebody else. So while I don&#x27;t favor the scent, my girlfriend goes crazy for it. She was the one to actually pick it. So, 5 stars for doing what it was made to do. Also, I went with this since I feel body sprays just don&#x27;t last as long within the day as well as can life. I&#x27;ve had this bottle for at least 2 months now and it must only be 1/3rd used up so far from using almost every day.</li>
    <li> The cologne has a fresh clean scent to it. The cologne does not last for long hours like I would like.</li>
    <li> This cologhn is good and smells just like the wolfthrone body wash but the smell of it dose not last on the humen body no  matter how much you spray on so I&#x27;m going back to my high dollar Ferrari EDT cologne I was using before this stuff before this last New Year&#x27;s Eve</li>
    <li> Good amount of cologne, has a minty, sharp smell. Comes in a plastic bottle, and lasts a long time. Not bad, but I prefer the original Old Spice.</li>
    <li> it came without box..  and smells wrong..  smells like more alcohol in it...</li>
    <li> This was gift to my son for the holidays whom likes the scent of this particular cologne brand. I frankly can&#x27;t take it, but I am actually allergic to strong cologne or perfume smell, no matter what brand it is. He was happy to receive it of course and uses as often he feels he needs to on occasion. so when I gave it 5 stars, was based on my son&#x27;s opinion, not mine.</li>
    <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long, but sure smells great.</li>
    <li> This Old Spice smells like that orange cleaner.At least I smell clean, and smell like a bag of oranges.Stick with the original!!!</li>
    <li> Nice and affordable, arrived promptly and was packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Smells great and nicely matches the body wash and deodorant of the same name. Not over powering, sporty, but acceptable as an every day type of smell. I save the fancy stuff for going out, this is perfect for normal use.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this &#x27;new&#x27; Old Spice. I&#x27;ve read mixed reviews and I guess it&#x27;s a matter of personal taste (or in this case, personal smell). But I love this stuff and others have commented how nice it smells on me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 100 sure that the people giving this a one star rating should even be writing reviews because it&#x27;s obviously a spray bottle from what it says in the description of the item in bold black lettering and it also clearly has a spray top in the picture. As for myself I do not mind the spray top and the wolf thorn scent is amazing. It&#x27;s nice when you walk into work and one of your coworkers says who smells so damn good and everyone else points At you.</li>
    <li> Not quite as nice smelling as the deoderant.</li>
    <li> I feel I lucked out on this cologne.  It smells great, and I love it after I shower from a long hot spirited walk.  Nothing better than Old Spice, and I love the Wolfthorn scent.</li>
    <li> this stuff makes pirates smell good. you know that&#x27;s a hard thing to do. you must use this with the body wash and body spray for the full effect. you spray it on your body and arms. the scent lasts awhile. you&#x27;ll turn heads. people may ask what you are wearing. if you want attention, wear this!</li>
    <li> So, I love the smell of their Wolfthorn deodorant and figured, hey, why not get some cologne in the same scent. The issue, this smells nothing like the deodorant. This is less candy like and more your normal Axe smell. It&#x27;s not entirely terrible hence two stars instead of one, but I just wanted everyone to be warned that the scent is something totally different to other products carrying the &#x27;Wolfthorn&#x27; name.</li>
