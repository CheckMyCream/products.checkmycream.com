<li> and I guess as long as it&#x27;s not a knock off or broken it works.</li>
<li> This fragrance, to me at least, demonstrates that we are men of refined tastes even during something as mundane as a gym workout.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find this at stores anymore, so I order it online for my boyfriend</li>

    <li> Great item for a great price. Amazon had this product for the cheapest price on the net for a NEW product. I think this is the best smellin colonge out there and so do the LADIES.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped quickly.  The box was slightly damaged but the product was in good condition.</li>
    <li> My fiance picked this cologne out for his Christmas present so of course he liked it!  I like it too!</li>
    <li> Polo Sport has been a favorite of mine for 20 years. My wife loves the way it smells and imagine my suprise when my 13 year-old daughter said she wanted to buy a bottle of it for her boyfriend for Christmas! It arrived quickly and just as described.</li>
    <li> Great price and very happy with it. This was a replacement gift for an empty bottle, so the scent wasn&#x27;t new, but again the price was the best I found.</li>

I recommend this product and vendor if you are looking for cologne for your manThis is an excellent sheild easy to put on and very durable.  I recommend this product and vendor if you are looking for cologne for your man</li>
    <li> my husband loves it and it smells great and it is hard to find many department stores do not  carry it anymore .</li>
    <li> Received my cologne from Amazon a couple days ago and it&#x27;s the real deal. I&#x27;m so happy they still make this stuff. But I did hear Polo Blue Sport is somewhat similar so that&#x27;s an option if they stop making Polo Sport. Anyways like other reviews have said the cologne is light and just has a unique citrus type smell. If you want it to last longer you may want to use a bit more. I&#x27;ve used 6 sprays and it lasted pretty long at a night club. I only had a little 3/8 oz bottle I got off eBay last year. People say to wear it during the summer or whatever but I&#x27;ll wear it at night in the winter.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume</li>
    <li> I love this cologne, and I was able to find it $5 cheaper at Amazon than anywhere else, plus free shipping fast.</li>
    <li> Classic fresh smell. Wife loves it. Will definitely be buying again. Bottle holds up too. Dropped it on the ground and it didn&#x27;t shatter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s never a disappointment. The package came ealier then expected as well. I bought it as a gift for my father and he loves it.</li>
    <li> my husband has worn this for years, and has no plans on trying anything else because he loves it so much.</li>
    <li> The perfume arrived in good condition and on the agreed date, really is an excellent perfume whose fragrance is very exquisite. I bought it from my husband and now I want it in style</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using polo sport for quite a few years now. Occasionally I experiment with another, but this is my always have on hand. Good masculine scent. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Although it took a couple weeks and didn&#x27;t come in time for Christmas, this is the only place I could find this Cologne, in years. Happy and satisfied to get it for my husband. this is one of our favorites.</li>
