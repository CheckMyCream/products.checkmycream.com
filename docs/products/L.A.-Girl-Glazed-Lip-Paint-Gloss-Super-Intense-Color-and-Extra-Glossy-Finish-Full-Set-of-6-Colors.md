<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing I love these so much I was kinda worried but they turned out to be so good and the colors are just perfect</li>
    <li> This lip paint has a minty flavor to it. It&#x27;s very pigmented.  I love this gloss.</li>
    <li> Came in very quickly and the colors are pigmented and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Great lippies but VERY runny. I think the applicator could be better and I would suggest using a lip brush. Otherwise the pigmentation is AWESOME and has a light minty smell. Lasts better than most lip glosses.</li>
    <li> These Wear Off To Fast And The Colors Look Dull After 20 Minutes. More For Younger Girls.</li>
    <li> Very drying to lips and stains finger and clothing.</li>
    <li> love them! great gloss !</li>
    <li> The packaging was simple and they pretty much looked like they came straight from manufacturer.  But def authentic product and all the rave and reviews I have come across from MUA I admire and follow on INSTAGRAM have been on point. So greatly pigmented a lil goes a long way nice gloss too, I recommend to use a lip primer prior to applying so it won&#x27;t run out of lip line. I use NYX lip primer my go to for lasting lipsticks, glosses and lip liners. If your a self taught MUA like myself this definitely is a great deal to add to your collections you can also mix/match and get different hues. My next purchase will be the nudes collection of LA Girls Lip Glaze. So if you are not afraid of colors and like to explore trust me you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Like, except that the purple had leaked everywhere.</li>
    <li> Everything was great!</li>
    <li> I love these! The colors are exactly that they look like on the bottle. The only down fall for me was that they have a weird taste. Aside from that I really like them.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful and they do slightly stain the lips for a nice flushed look after they wear off. The formula is a little bit thinner than expected, but if you apply with a brush it is not a problem.</li>
    <li> All I can say is Yassssssssssss!!!</li>
    <li> I really like these. They would be better with a different applicator.</li>
    <li> Originally I LOVED this lip paint! I purchased the purple color coy and a pink color. I was so happy to finally find the exact shade of purple lip gloss and it looked amazing and went on smoothly. However, after frequent use over the next 3 weeks I noticed my lips started breaking out, which has never happened to me before. It started with peeling on my top lip, then spread to my bottom lip. I applied more lip balm and continued using the product. With more lip paint use, my lips only got worse. I finally figured out the cause was this gloss and I stopped using it. After a week of discontinuing my lips are starting to heal but I still have darker pigment on my top lip. Watch what you&#x27;re putting on your lips ladies! Sometimes the affordable cost isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> These are great especially for the price</li>
    <li> I absolutely looove these!!! Very Pigmented, a little goes a long way, Check out my revieW On Youtube!! look for The Blonde Fashionista and my review is up under my channel!!</li>
    <li> as soon as i open them up they explode and make a mess. careful!</li>
    <li> This gloss is wonderful. I have never purchased a gloss that have actually showed through as the color indicated on the tube. I have dark lips and I could never get gloss to show the real color.  Well these are beautiful on, smells like a hint of peppermint, color stays on for about 3 hours. CAUTION if your lips are chapped this will look a hot crusty mess! Exfoliate first! make your own 1 tsp coconut oil&amp; brown sugar. Mix apply to lips by using circular motion rinse off to your smooth lips.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! I WANT EVERY COLOR!!! Will place more orders until I have every shade!</li>
    <li> Not for me, ewww what a mess. This is lip gloss for artistry only. This lip gloss is very runny, it&#x27;s runs all over, above beyond and teeth. I threw it all in the garbage, not for me!!!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of them &amp; there were only 2 colors that were actually wearable for me.</li>
    <li> Nice product &amp; very nice colors the shipping was fast, would totally reccomend!:)</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and love the colors. Packaged good as well!</li>
    <li> Great colors~easy application~nice matte colors with just enough shine and great pigment!!</li>
    <li> Once I figured out I couldn&#x27;t apply it like a regular lip gloss, they&#x27;re wonderful.  The colors are simply fabulous. I plan to get the other sets.  When I apply them with my finger, it seems to work well for me.  It has a mint-ish taste, which is refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the unfortunate things is the applicator dispenses the product too quickly and there is significant waste of the product.  Applying it like a regular lip gloss is too icky, way too sticky, and the consistency is too thin and uneven. It also comes off too easily and no matter what I did, it came off on my teeth.  Lastly, it feathered quite a bit, even if I used a lip liner.</li>
    <li> Great pigmentation but the applicator is horrible.</li>
    <li> Wonderful colors&lt;br /&gt;But the pack needs her control color output that comes out of large quantity</li>
    <li> These lipsticks were good but not great.  The lighter colors didn&#x27;t lay well on my lips (they didn&#x27;t look as natural).  I dont care for the applicator, it was messy and not easy to use.  Outside of that, this is an ok deal for the $$.</li>
    <li> I hate the plastic applicators makes it hard to apply the product is amazing just use a clean finger or brush to apply.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t joking when they say super intense. LA Girl did that! These are great colors that you can wear with a lotta sass! Can&#x27;t wait to get the other shades. You can custom mix shades to get ur own as well.</li>
    <li> The formula is kind of goopy if used straight from the tube. I like to apply with a lip brush because it is more precise.</li>
    <li> Love them! Very pigmented and long lasting.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to receive these !! I&#x27;m beyond excited !!</li>
    <li> Favorite lip gloss ever!!! Seriously so happy I discovered these!! The color is amazing and glossy and lasts a long time!!! Will never use anything else, I want every color ever made!!♡♡</li>
    <li> love love love inexpensive way to get the color payoff</li>
    <li> Awesome pigmentation and they arrived on time, but I read the reviews and thought  that being certified i wouldn&#x27;t need a liner or my gloss brush...EVERYONE DOES THESE WILL FEATHER/BLEED LIKE NO OTHER without some sort of application brush and liner, I suggest the NYX Cosmetics Long Lasting Slim Lip Liner Pencils 6 Colors, there is actually a fairly good match in there for each &amp;#34;paint gloss&amp;#34; and lip liner!!! There is also just a great NYX anti feathering liner that works great, and its at a great drugstore price!!! But I love the glosses they are great, build-able, and smell amazing (if you like minty sort of smells ;)) Transaction was great and they came WAYYY before they were said to arrive #143♥!!!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this extremely pigmented nice minty smell good pay off</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re amazing !! came in like a week or two can&#x27;t remember I&#x27;ve had them for a while now.</li>
    <li> Wonder pigmentation and texture! You &#x27; ll need a lip brush because the product is very pigmented &amp; the applicator is not precise but it&#x27;s worth it for this price. Oh, and super fast shipping from this great seller!!</li>
    <li> love them all my favs&lt;br /&gt;out of the 100&#x27;s of lipsticks and lip glosses i have</li>
    <li> I love these. I am not a lip-gloss person but I had to see if these were as vibrant as they look and they are. I&#x27;d say they are def a cheaper version of Lip Tar. I usually wear them over a lipstick that I&#x27;d like to add just tad bit of shine too without being too glossy. They are great to add with a liner as well. The price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I find is the application which is to be expected with lip-gloss, I wish it had a felt tip but it&#x27;s nothing to sway you away from. The red is my favorite, absolutely vibrant.</li>
    <li> I have been seeing these all over YouTube and I just HAD to get them. I ordered them Sunday and I got them in the mail today, Wednesday.  How awesome is that?! Free shipping AND fast delivery? That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talkin about! The only thing you need to be careful of is when you are cutting open the package. They are just in loose in the package and when I was cutting the top to open it (trying to be careful not to snip any of the glosses), I of course snipped one of the glosses and made a tiny hole (thank goodness for super glue). It&#x27;s all good now, but just be careful :) The colors are absolutely amazing and so creamy. Enjoy :)</li>
    <li> Love these the color are super pigmented!! Also great deal 19 dollars for a set of six :)</li>
    <li> I do not like this one, very disappointed it&#x27;s to dark and not glossy enough.....</li>
    <li> Love these colors and think they&#x27;re a great alternative to Too Faced products. Needs to be applied with a brush, but color holds true for most of the day.</li>
    <li> Great colors, babydoll is my favorite. Definitely need a lip brush though!</li>
    <li> Great for kids not adults</li>
    <li> I bought these after reading so many 5-star reviews. These colors are so obnoxious looking! I tried mixing colors to get something that wouldn&#x27;t be so theatrical and clown looking. I tried applying these with my finger, with a brush and just from the tube - I hate these! They are so pasty and look grainy or like they&#x27;re separating on the mouth. They do not dry down and just stay sticky!</li>
    <li> Delivery on time-Product as described- 1 issue One Color was leaking through seal...</li>
    <li> I love these lip glosses. long lasting and vibrant color!</li>
    <li> Rich in color. These apply like a gloss, very slippery. And be careful squeezing the tube because a lot can come out because it is not a very thick solution. A little goes a long way. And because the solution is thin, you have to re-apply more which isn&#x27;t that bad because they have a minty scent and taste.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> Just bought these in every color perfect duplicate of too faced melted . Make up artist must have</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors.  A little messy when applying.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colors. I saw these on YouTube and decided to try them out. I must say they are the perfect combination between lip stick and lip gloss. The lip paint stays put and doesn&#x27;t run. And it&#x27;s great quality too.</li>
    <li> These lip paint are awesome! I&#x27;m addicted have them in every color they have! Love the stain they leave and are well rich in the color they are. I get lots of compliments when I wear these. The smell I like it&#x27;s almost minty.!</li>
    <li> I must say, I have never purchased a lipgloss so full if color! It&#x27;s like actual paint and the colors are flawless...and it has a hint of mint...AWESOME!!! I just ordered the pastel colors too...can&#x27;t wait to try them!</li>
    <li> At first I was disappointed because the colors were feathering a little bit and not doing well after sipping on a drink or eating food- but then I put a separate gloss over the lip paints and voila! It sets it for me. It doesn&#x27;t stay a vibrant color all day long (without reapplying) but if you don&#x27;t reapply then it simply fades down into a pretty sheer color (after a good amount of time). Over all, I really like them. The colors are the prettiest that I have ever seen and they actually all flatter my face, which is amazing. Not all colors go with every face, but these seem to be different for me. They are gorgeous. I especially love &#x27;coy&#x27;. There are a couple shades that I haven&#x27;t tried yet. Also, they don&#x27;t dry my lips out! And for me, that&#x27;s the number one draw or kill, pertaining to a lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awesome. I&#x27;m happy!  :)</li>
    <li> I love these. The shades are great and prices are awesome. Very satisfied. Quick ship also. Will purchase from user again</li>
    <li> Love loveee these glosses there glossy and pigmented they last for so long i had lunch and dinner and it leaves a pretty stain on your lips! Highly reccomend these!!</li>
    <li> These are great lip glosses. They aren&#x27;t quite like OCC Lip Tar, nor like Too Faced Melted Lip Gloss, but they are still good and long lasting. Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Very pigmented, moisturizing and glossy. I blot because I prefer a matte or semi-matte finish but now I have the option to go full on glossy too. Blushing is the only work appropriate shade (at least for me) but the others will be so fun going out. Surprisingly thin texture that lasts quite long. Delicious minty taste and smell (similar to the CO Bigelow mint lip gloss).</li>
    <li> Super shiny vibrant lip paints.  HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> I love these lip paints...!</li>
    <li> I love these lip paint and feel I got a great deal from this seller for them. They arrived in a very timely manner. They&#x27;re so highly pigmented it&#x27;s unbelievable. You NEED a lip brush to apply these correctly. They can get very messy VERY quick. They are not sticky at all. The glossy finish fades fairly quick but that&#x27;s ok with me. I like more matte finishes on my lips any how. I would recommend these to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> These are amaze! So highly pigmented &amp; so shiny! Great variety of colors! Next I want to get the fall collection! So worth it! At 2 dollars and sum change a pop u can&#x27;t go wrong! 👍😉</li>
    <li> I loved these when I first tried them. They are very vibrant which I love and very shiny not sticky, but they don&#x27;t last long. 2 hours tops and you have to re-apply. So for that I gave them 4 stars😕.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve worn every color and they are lovely!</li>
    <li> Very very pigmented. Has a nice minty flavor. Two of the colors are way too bright for me, but they can be easily dulled using tissue and a little powder.</li>
    <li> Only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars is because they were WAAAAAY brighter than expected. Like literally the color you see on the tube is the color that&#x27;s going to come out on your lips. Being a dark skin black woman 2/6 colors I can wear regularly. But that&#x27;s my fault I should&#x27;ve read it carefully. I can work with all these colors though in some way so not too disappointed. Plus they&#x27;re smooth and kind of creamy. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Super pigmented, vibrant and feels great on the lips. Not sticky at all. It can get a little messy but a lip brush can remedy that. I will be ordering the complete collection.</li>
    <li> Came fast and was a great deal, thanks!</li>
    <li> These lippies are comparable to the Toofaced ones. High pigmentation and great staying power. Colors are exactly as seen on the tube. Very vibrant and non sticky which I love. Long lasting color and shine. This is definitely a good buy for those on a budget!</li>
    <li> Just got them today! I absolutely love them plus I got my items super fast :) P.s I recommend using a lip brush when applying on your lips.</li>
    <li> Application from the tube is a bit messy as there is no mechanism to control the output. But it is a great product, very pigmented and smells great.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and they have amazing color pay off. anazing color select I.have 12 out of the 18 shades.</li>
    <li> Love these rich colors....</li>
    <li> I have yet to use them all day just did swatches but the colors are super pigmented and pretty. I was a little nervous because I&#x27;m darker more Indian skin but they look awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing so much about these I can&#x27;t wait until they get here!! $16 bucks! Free shipping, for all 6 is a pretty great deal</li>
    <li> Totally in love! So soft and gorgeous!!! I wish I could wear them all the time, unfortunately they aren&#x27;t all office friendly colors): really hoping to get the nudes and fall colors soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning, be extremely careful when applying because it does all come out at once and to keep clean, wipe before recapping (:</li>
    <li> These are AMAZING. I feel like they are thinner than the Painted lipsticks from Too Faced... perhaps more similar (despite their packaging) to OCC Lip Tars. I have been mixing them together to create my own colors, which has worked out beautifully. You cannot beat this for the price point. I got all 6 for less than a single OCC lip tar or Painted lipstick from Too Faced!  I plan on collecting the nude set they just came out with as well. I bet that having those lighter tones together with this set as mixers will give me a whole new range of amazing shades to experiment with! Really, nothing to lose on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I prefer to apply these with a lip brush for a more precise application. Although these have a THIN (and not sticky) texture, they are SUPER pigmented, so apply with care. They are long-lasting and give off a really rich color.  They tend to go on with a lot of shine at first, but the shine dissipates over time - but the color does not.</li>
    <li> These are so beautiful on the lips. Very pigmented and the colors are gorgeous. They are a little thin and messy to apply simply squeeing it out from the tube. I would suggest applying with a lip brush for more accuracy. Overall these are super affordable and look awesome. And don&#x27;t forget you can mix and match colors: I mixed Coy and Bombshell to create the most gorgeous lilac pink/purple, and PinUp and Hot mess creates a really nice coral shade. The options are endless and definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> By far the best lipgloss ever made! Love them!!</li>
    <li> I like them a lot....I think that they are worth the money...My only prob with these I don&#x27;t like the way they fade...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with these I bought the nudes too! Application can be a little tricky but the payoff is outstanding for the price you pay! I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> They feather with the brighter colors kids like it just slids off my lips,.. Kinda disappointed</li>
    <li> I love the colors, smell, and how pigmented it is. The problem with this product though, is that it bleeds into my teeth way too much, and it needs to be reapplied a lot. But perhaps that&#x27;s just because I talk a lot. I would buy them again though, if I do finish the set I have now.</li>
    <li> These are very runny and thin.  They also have a horrible minty chemical stench.  Huge disappointment!  Pretty colors, but these are hitting the trash.  I fail to understand who could like these, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Got Mine Today Love It💋💋</li>
    <li> These are AMAZING! The pigment is also amazing....really what you see is what you get as far a color! with just enough shine. Next time I wear one of these I&#x27;ll probably apply a lip liner first. I had the lip tar in the color hoocie from Sophora which was $19 and it looks just like the LA girl coy color.  These SIX LA Girl lip paints were $20 with shipping. I returned the lip tar that I bought from Sophora.</li>
    <li> After watching many reviews on these glosses I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my own.....shipping was extremely fast ( like 3 days ) which was a plus, the color pay off is amazingggggg and you can build it to as light or dark as you like, it smells like mint if your into that which for me is great I hate buy inexpensive lip products that smell like crayons so loving that...my only con is its very messy, its best to apply a small amount at first then add a little at a time it will get on your teeth so I don&#x27;t like that plus the applicator is not the best for applying neatly so you have to use a lip brush for perfect application but I just use the tip of my finger to push the product along my lip line evenly....its not sticky so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on your lips so with that being said its not as long wearing but the colors are everything and I love them all.</li>
    <li> I Love This Gloss ! Its nice and bright</li>
    <li> Pretty, mixable colors, not sticky. Has tingling mint flavor which i dont mind at all giving these GOURGEOS colors!</li>
    <li> Love these! They are so pigmented. Great price!</li>
    <li> a little messy to apply but great color. wears off but use a lip liner you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
    <li> I love these lip paints but they don&#x27;t last long.  I took off one star because of the packaging and another star because of the fact that they have to be reapplied every couple of hours.  The packaging of this product makes on the go touch up a headache.  This product needs a dough foot applicator.</li>
    <li> I think the colors from the first Glazed Lip Paint collection are stunning! I&#x27;m so glad I picked them up. They are moisturizing, glossy, and not sticky. Plus the shades are pigmented and you&#x27;re getting a great quality product for the price. The tube is soft, so product can get all over the place if you&#x27;re not careful. Gently squeeze the tube, and apply with a lip brush!  I can&#x27;t wait to purchase the other colors. I recommend these if you&#x27;re on a budget, and want to rock the hottest colors of the season!</li>
    <li> These are amazing! The color payoff is great considering the price, and they are super pigmented. I would definitely buy more colors soon. I&#x27;m not a fan of the orange gloss, because it&#x27;s almost too orange, if that makes sense, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference. I highly suggest these!</li>
    <li> Great product and price!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these colors!! They are very pigmented and glossy. They have a slight minty feeling when you put them on. You must moisturize your lips first or else the lip gloss will show between the cracks of your lips. These are usually $4-$5 each so getting 6/$16 was just great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful pigmentation!</li>
    <li> i will buy more of these lip glosses</li>
</ol>
