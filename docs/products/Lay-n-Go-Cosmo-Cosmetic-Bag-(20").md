      <li>Love this bag!  </li>
      <li>Love this thing!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I use this all of the time at the gym to set up my space and have my own &amp;#34;territory&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
      <li>Comes in many colors, too.</li>
      <li>I love not getting my counters covered in powders.</li>
      <li>I love the color and design and</li>
      <li>love this makeup bag -</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad I used it.</li>
      <li>it fits everything and has a really cute design</li>
      <li>This was the perfect gift for me as I travel extensively.</li>
      <li>It keeps everything neat and safe from hotels counters.</li>
      <li>It does everything as described, keeps makeup items secure, but then opens for easy access.  </li>
      <li>It packed neatly in my bag, and kept everything secure and protected with it&#x27;s padding.</li>
      <li>I can fit it all in and find everything with ease.  </li>
      <li>The idea is really nice, but the bag ends up being really bulky.</li>
      <li>I selected the orange-pink zigzag pattern &amp; it is pretty and cheerful!</li>
      <li>Very well made and cute.</li>
      <li>It is very pretty</li>
      <li>This seems like it might be a good idea for a car commuter who has no time in the mornings, but other than that I can&#x27;t see its use as a traveler.</li>
      <li>I closed the plastic wrap over the top of the make-up containers and it was easy to reuse it it all week.</li>
      <li>Easy to open and find everything you need quickly.</li>
      <li>It closes with a durable drawstring and I love the patterned outside.</li>
      <li>How many times have you had to dig through your makeup back to find your mascara or whatever else at the every bottom.</li>
      <li>I love the colorful orange and pink, which makes it easy to spot in my larger bag.</li>
      <li>I put them into a delicates wash bag (on the gentle cycle) to keep the cord from getting tangled in everything else.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to see everything spread out on the counter</li>
      <li>I ordered the pink and orange zigzag design and love it.</li>
      <li>So many other uses too . . .</li>
      <li>I wanted to keep the bag as clean as possible</li>
      <li>And then when your done you can shove it all back in or leave it for later when you have more time.</li>
      <li>I then lay that bag on top of the rest of the cosmetics, and pull the drawstring tight.</li>
      <li>My bathroom mirror is right above my sink.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this so much in the past year and stopped using plastic wrap inside because these are so easy to wash and come out looking new.</li>
      <li>With the Layngo, I simply opened the bag and everything was instantly visible and easily accessible.</li>
      <li>Just got back from my first trip with this bag.</li>
      <li>There is so much fabric that if you could just put up things not lying flat, you can save so much space while packing.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s a lot of loose powder if there&#x27;s an incident involving a loose container top.</li>
      <li>I am a busy person &amp; like to be organized.</li>
      <li>This bag eliminates both problems completely.</li>
      <li>So far after one trip it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
      <li>I use Bare Minerals make-up</li>
      <li>When it&#x27;s open you can see everything you need right in front of you, no digging around in a smaller bag or one with lots of little pockets.</li>

<li> There are 5 little bands inside to hold your eye liner pencils, brushes and 1 zipper compartment as well.</li>
<li> It did get a little bit powder-y, but I think it&#x27;s washable.</li>
<li> There was a little powder residue</li>
<li> a few months ago</li>
<li> 100% Waste.</li>
<li> it holds lots of stuff of odd sizes and shapes with no problems!</li>
<li> so I lined it with plastic wrap for its trial run this past week.</li>
<li> If you toss the bag around, small items could fall out.</li>
<li> When I&#x27;m done, it just closes up to a small pouch for conveniently storing or packing.  </li>

    <li> This is my 2nd  LaynGo cosmetic Bag! I love it! It holds all my make-up beautifully in tact, when traveling! Easy to open and find everything you need quickly. Comes in many colors, too.</li>
    <li> The idea is really nice, but the bag ends up being really bulky. There is so much fabric that if you could just put up things not lying flat, you can save so much space while packing. This seems like it might be a good idea for a car commuter who has no time in the mornings, but other than that I can&#x27;t see its use as a traveler.</li>

    <li> A wonderful no-hassle cosmetic bag!  I can fit it all in and find everything with ease.  When I&#x27;m done, it just closes up to a small pouch for conveniently storing or packing.  So many other uses too . . . it holds lots of stuff of odd sizes and shapes with no problems!</li>
    <li> love this makeup bag - it fits everything and has a really cute design</li>
    <li> Terrific! This was the perfect gift for me as I travel extensively. It keeps everything neat and safe from hotels counters. It washes beautifully.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my sister as a gift. She liked it, so we gave one to our mom also who travels often!</li>
    <li> Just got back from my first trip with this bag. Works great! I wear mineral powder makeup, and have to lay out my cosmetics on a towel on the counter or it&#x27;s a big mess. This keeps everything all contained, no towel required. It came inside another matching drawstring bag, and I used that bag to contain my brushes. I then lay that bag on top of the rest of the cosmetics, and pull the drawstring tight. This eliminates the possibility of anything escaping through the tiny hole created by the drawstring, and it corrals my brushes neatly. I take them out, set the bag on the side, and set the brushes on the bag, then I have the cosmetics laying in the Layngo. It did get a little bit powder-y, but I think it&#x27;s washable. So far after one trip it&#x27;s not a problem. It packed neatly in my bag, and kept everything secure and protected with it&#x27;s padding. I love the colorful orange and pink, which makes it easy to spot in my larger bag. This is truly a great invention. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I got the pink COSMO bag. It is very pretty and I have tried it out already. I will be taking this to England with me in the fall.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and find this is perfect for my hair utensils</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it! It sits on my bathroom counter with my everyday makeup in it, much easier than having everything in drawers. Will be marvelous when traveling, will buy more for gifts!</li>
    <li> I ordered the pink and orange zigzag design and love it. I use Bare Minerals make-up so that&#x27;s a lot of loose powder if there&#x27;s an incident involving a loose container top. I wanted to keep the bag as clean as possible so I lined it with plastic wrap for its trial run this past week. I closed the plastic wrap over the top of the make-up containers and it was easy to reuse it it all week. There was a little powder residue so I&#x27;m glad I used it. Next time, I&#x27;ll cut open a plastic grocery bag and use that (the mineral powder gets everywhere no matter what you do!).  I used to put everything into a regular zippered case and had to remove every item to see what everything was. With the Layngo, I simply opened the bag and everything was instantly visible and easily accessible. Comments have been made about the bag not cinching tightly - I didn&#x27;t have that problem. Nothing could have fallen out. It made my morning routine so simple.  Comments have also been made about the price. I agree - it&#x27;s over-priced but selected this instead of a cheaper competitor due to the saying, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34;  I love the color and design and the quality is there.  Update 4/17/16 - I bought another Layngo at Costco (much better price!) a few months ago and it&#x27;s wonderful to have 2 of these.  I&#x27;ve used this so much in the past year and stopped using plastic wrap inside because these are so easy to wash and come out looking new. I put them into a delicates wash bag (on the gentle cycle) to keep the cord from getting tangled in everything else. It&#x27;s so much easier to see everything spread out on the counter and when you&#x27;re done - cinch it up and put it away. Great idea!</li>
    <li> I LOVE it! A little big for my purse so I want to order the 13&amp;#34; size also but I can only find it in black. The product is awesome!</li>
    <li> Love this thing!  Will be giving as gifts!  It does everything as described, keeps makeup items secure, but then opens for easy access.  I appreciate the added zip pocket inside, for loose items such as safety pins, hair pins, brow tweezers etc.  Used it for a recent 10 day vacation and made my makeup easier to access and then store/travel with.  I selected the orange-pink zigzag pattern &amp; it is pretty and cheerful!</li>
    <li> Perfect! So happy I found this makeup bag. I am a busy person &amp; like to be organized. This does both. My bathroom mirror is right above my sink. I put it in the sink when I put my makeup on, I can see everything at once. There are 5 little bands inside to hold your eye liner pencils, brushes and 1 zipper compartment as well. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Love this bag!  It works beautifully at home as well as for travel.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because there is a small hole left even when I cinch it tightly.  If you toss the bag around, small items could fall out.</li>
    <li> 100% Waste. Mine doesn&#x27;t even close properly</li>
    <li> How many times have you had to dig through your makeup back to find your mascara or whatever else at the every bottom. And then when your done you can shove it all back in or leave it for later when you have more time. This bag eliminates both problems completely. The bag holds everything I need and then some. I love not getting my counters covered in powders. I wish I&#x27;d found this sooner. It closes with a durable drawstring and I love the patterned outside.</li>
    <li> I use this all of the time at the gym to set up my space and have my own &amp;#34;territory&amp;#34;. Very well made and cute.</li>
    <li> This is my second COSMO cosmetic bag. Now I&#x27;ve got one for home and one for travel. Just dump all your stuff in, pull the cord, and put it away or in your suitcase. The lip around the edge keeps things from rolling away. When it&#x27;s open you can see everything you need right in front of you, no digging around in a smaller bag or one with lots of little pockets.</li>
