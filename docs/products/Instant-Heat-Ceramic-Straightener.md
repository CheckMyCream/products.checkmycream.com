      <li>I am amazed at how good my hair looks when I&#x27;m done.</li>

      <li>Very pleased that I made the switch.</li>
      <li>so I could try it, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>&quot; It was pretty good, but not the best.</li>

      <li>Besides the size of this hair iron is perfect, not too big but good fit to my hands.</li>
      <li>For the price, though, this seems like an ok trade-off since I don&#x27;t need a heavy-duty straightener.    </li>
      <li>I know I needed a much smaller plate, this straightener is perfect.</li>
      <li>worked fantastic while in Europe!</li>
      <li>SO glad I got it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find one in my price range</li>
      <li>Love the size and the swivel cord.</li>

      <li>I bought an Andis straightner today that I am hoping works better.</li>
      <li>Just ordered three more as Christmas gifts.</li>
      <li>Oh you can go to a beauty supply shop and buy one i am sure they have one at a resonable price.</li>
      <li>and after I straighten to help control my hair, so that may be a factor that makes my hair slightly more obedient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had to repeat the process and then found better results.  </li>
      <li>It costs about $8 more</li>
      <li>and I just love it.</li>
      <li>It works ok</li>
      <li>Both my wife and daughter love theirs.</li>
      <li>and I would say it was more than money</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the size and the swivel cord.</li>
    <li> arrived on time..good product..great price..i&#x27;d order from them again</li>
    <li> I could have swore I&#x27;d ordered the bigger one, so I was a little disappointed when the small one arrived.  It works ok but I have thick hair so it takes forever.</li>
    <li> I have a very short pixie haircut and extremely thick hair. This flat iron works great on my hair. There&#x27;s several different heat settings for different types of hair.</li>
    <li> This iron worked wonders on my naturally frizzy and thick hair.  It made my hair smooth, silky and soft and with little effort!  This is definitely the lightest iron I&#x27;ve ever used, and the curved handle makes it so easy to maintain good control.  I have hair about 4 inches below my shoulders and it took me about 10 minutes to make it all straight.  I love to flip the ends of my hair out, and the outside of the iron lets you do this with ease.  It has a &amp;quot;grippy&amp;quot; texture on it which also stays cool to protect your scalp.  I paid $14.99 for it and I would say it was more than money well spent.  I am so happy with this iron and would recommend it to everybody who wants a natural-straight look, instead of a fried-straight look!</li>
    <li> This this is AWFUL! my hair is completly fried, and after 2 weeks it doesnt even straighten anymore.   Dont waist your money</li>
    <li> This straightener will probably do a really good job on shorter hair, but it does not get hot enough to make my hair silky smooth and dead straight. Granted, it was less than 20 bucks.&lt;BR&gt;I suggest this straightener for short hair, but my hair is extremely long and wavy, and this straightener didn&#x27;t grant me the smooth, thin texture I desired. If you invest in some good styling products, however, it might work for you.&lt;BR&gt;I am now buying a Hot Tools one, that brand works well and the products are less expensive than HAI or CHI straighteners.</li>
    <li> First i was kinda worried about getting this product. Im a guy with short hair, but its kinda wavy and puffs after a shower. i needed a hair straightner thats thin enough to grab my hair and allow me to control it, and thats what this product did. now i luv my hair more and last longer with a longer hair do without having to worry about not gettin my hair style right.</li>
    <li> I used this flat iron for over a year and couldn&#x27;t figure out why my hair was so dry and damaged.  I switched shampoos, conditioners, other hair products, hair dryers and even hair stylists before I finally decided to try a different flat iron.  The difference is dramatic!  This ConAir just does not compare.  It is NOT ceramic like it says, it is ceramic-COATED and there is a BIG difference.  If you want to stop battling your hair every morning, splurge on a CHI flat iron and you will immediately see that it is worth every penny.  I feel terrible for damaging my hair with the ConAir for so long.  I finally have soft, silky hair again and it is only because I stopped using the ConAir flat iron.</li>
    <li> This flat iron just splits my hair and pulls it. I use my flat iron daily and couldn&#x27;t take using this item anymore. I trashed it and bought a Remington for only a little more but that works 100x better.</li>
    <li> This little straightener works well for short or medium length, moderately wavy or frizzy hair.  I&#x27;ve owned several of them, and my only complaint is that they simply stop working after 6 to 9 months.  For the price, though, this seems like an ok trade-off since I don&#x27;t need a heavy-duty straightener.    I don&#x27;t understand why ladies with really long, thick, curly hair are on here complaining that this straightener doesn&#x27;t work for them.  If you have major straightening needs, why did you buy the smallest, cheapest straightener available and then get annoyed that it doesn&#x27;t work for you?  This is a TOOL, think like a guy and get yourself the right tool for the job.</li>
    <li> Painfully pulls on my hair, doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, cheap plastic. Everything about this flat iron is a failure. Do not buy it.</li>
    <li> works well and straigtens hair smoothly.</li>
    <li> I have naturally straight hair, and for most of my life I wore my hair long, usually one length.  For the last few years, though (now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s) I&#x27;ve had my hair cut in various shorter, layered styles. Since I never needed to do much styling with my straight hair, it&#x27;s taken me a little while to \\&quot;get\\&quot; it; sometimes my hair would look great, sometimes it would be funky, and I could never figure out how to make it look the right way if it happened to be a day my hair wasn&#x27;t cooperating.  Because I have naturally straight hair, the idea of needing or using a flatiron never occurred to me; I don&#x27;t need to \\&quot;straighten\\&quot; my hair. It wasn&#x27;t until my new stylist recommended using one to get the look I was going for with my new cut that I ever picked one up, and I will be forever grateful! (FTR, she recommended \\&quot;a(ny) flatiron\\&quot;; not this particular model)   For what I am using it for, this item is perfect. Basically, I use it to polish side swept bangs (something I could never get the hang of until I started using a flatiron) and I also use it to smooth and \\&quot;flip\\&quot; the ends of my layers to make it look cute.  The iron heats up quickly, the buttons are easy to use; it&#x27;s pretty foolproof, from my generally style-challenged perspective.      Basically, I chose this item based on the price. Since I never used one before, and wasn&#x27;t sure how much I&#x27;d be using it (and wasn&#x27;t going to be giving it heavy duty use) I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot (I had no idea that flatirons could be so expensive!)  I&#x27;m glad I was able to find one in my price range so I could try it, and I am very satisfied with my purchase. I doubt I&#x27;ll be upgrading since this seems to suit my needs perfectly.   Admittedly, I am NOT using it for heavy duty straightening, and I cannot comment on it&#x27;s suitability for that, but for occasional light-duty styling, it works great.</li>
    <li> Mine was fine the first week or so I had it. I use it an average of 2 times per week. By the second week (about 4 uses) it stopped heating up as much. It was enough to get my hair somewhat straight, but not enough. I called the company and asked what I can do about it since my 90 days is up at the store. They told me to package it, pay to ship it back, AND write them a check for them to ship me a new one. That was going to cost more than buying a new one. Their response was that I had no other options. I told them my option would be to buy another brand. I have seen more than one review saying this happens. Do they not see a problem here?</li>
    <li> I love this Straightener! I have very wavy, unruly hair and this will actually straighten it quickly. I am amazed at how good my hair looks when I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s also very inexpensive. It&#x27;s well worth the price. This is definitely one of the best out there on the market.</li>
    <li> Finally a small straightener that has several temperature settings. Heated up quickly and made my freshly relaxed hair smooth and straight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this straightener for a little over a year now, and I have to say that, although it&#x27;s not perfect, it does its job. Basically, I have the type of Asian hair that&#x27;s \\&quot;straight,\\&quot; but actually kind of thick and wavy. The straightener gets hot enough to make my hair actually stick straight (definitely way more than 68 degrees: it&#x27;s hot enough that my fingers hurt if I touch my hair afterward, not to mention that 68F is below room temperature anyway...) and I&#x27;ve also been able to curl all of my hair with this tiny straightener. It does tend to tug at hair (it boasts this as a \\&quot;feature\\&quot; but it&#x27;s not fun) but it&#x27;s cheap and it works. Maybe it works a little more slowly than more expensive ones, but it really isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
    <li> I think this straightener is nice. It&#x27;s not the best, but then again, it&#x27;s only $12. I bought it because it said it was ceramic. When I opened it, it said \\&quot;ceramic technology\\&quot; which means the plates are just ceramic coated. It&#x27;s better than no ceramic at all, but there was a gap in it so I had to squeeze it tightly to actually use it. It also made my hair stick out. My hair is pretty straight naturally, and this made my hair \\&quot;emo-like.\\&quot; It was pretty good, but not the best. Conair makes better, real ceramic straighteners, so I bought a new one and it works much better. The handle was fine, but there was no swivel cord, which is lame. Any straightener that is gold or says \\&quot;ceramic technology\\&quot; is not very good quality, so save your money and buy a real one.</li>
    <li> Great straightener and great price!</li>
    <li> If you want to end up with a frizzy look, and get your hair pulled by the flat iron plates, you should buy this item.   I wished I have never get this, is a terrible product, doesn&#x27;t do the work, and damage your hair. you better save your money, than buy this crappy product.</li>
    <li> Okay I have to say I love this straightener alot!!! But whats with all the bad reviews on it. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it. Sure it heats up kind of slowly and its skinny and it takes a while to get to all of your hair but you just to be patient. That what my mom says. Just to be patient. Now im 14 and obviously a teenager so teenagers are very impatient but i can wait a while i just have to think about something else. If your patient this straightener will work. As for the people with curly and frizzy hair i dont think you should buy this because it wont work because its so skinny and you might get extremely frusturated. But I like it so dont listen to the bad reviews.    BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> I am on my second one and I just love it. My hair is medium texture and a little wavy and it works great especially for the price. My sister has thick curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t work as well for her. After a while (a year or so) the coating does start coming off the plates, but I will still buy this one again.</li>
    <li> heats up quickly and does the job.  I have short hair which is thin but a lot of it so the width is a perfect size for me.  It works well on my daughter who has very long thick hair but needs to be done in smaller sections.</li>
    <li> I have very thick curly hair. This iron does not do the job - I had to go over the same section of hair a couple of times. It  just does not get hot enough, the plates are small and it feels cheap and flimsy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It might be ok if you aren&#x27;t going to be straightening your hair all the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener to polish up a little when I need it, but I do have fairly thick, straight shoulder length hair anyway. I need it most after I go to sleep with wet hair and I wake up with it pointing in every which direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most annoying thing I find is that with the button placement to turn it on and put it on \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; is terrible. I&#x27;m left handed, and I know we&#x27;re only about 10% of the population. But I turn it off constantly and then wonder why it&#x27;s stopped working. So I have to turn it on again and wait for it to heat, again. This is the largest downfall for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s a middle of the road straightener and does the trick for the most part. Sometimes I feel it could be a bit better and get more of a sleekness without having to go over the spot more then once, but, hey, it was around 15-20 bucks. For a casual user who doesn&#x27;t rely on this daily, I think it&#x27;s fine, though eventually I&#x27;ll probably upgrade a bit. For someone who uses a straightener without question every morning and really invests a lot in their &#x27;look&#x27; 7 days a week, you might want to find something better.</li>
    <li> This was the first ceramic straightener I used. It&#x27;s not as hot as some, but it does glide smoothly. Good bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> conair just really does not make great hair straighteners. i bought the full size one before, and without warning it just quit working after a 2 months. i have a revlon full-size one now (which works GREAT). i recently got my hair cut short, so i decided to go buy a cheap small one to reach the short hair in the back. turn the turbo on, blast it up to the highest temperature, and it still is not even half as hot as my revlon one thats turned on minimum. i have really thin hair, and its not even curly it just gets wavy sometimes. this thing cant even straighten that much.</li>
    <li> I have loved this product in the past.  I have tried other bulkier products that didn&#x27;t seem to be as easy to grip my hair with.  First bought this at Albertson&#x27;s for $50.00 6 years ago.  When it died after a couple years, I went back for another of the same product.  After it broke last week, I thought I would go ahead and purchase it again.  But as I read reviews on other products, I realized I was cheating myself.  I deserve better.  I don&#x27;t want to spend nearly $100 on a CHI.  So, I bought the Ceramic Tools CT2555 Professional Straightening Iron instead.  Only for around $20. I used it today and am pleased.  The conair CS4JCS has the same settings as the Ceramic Tools CT2555.  Same slim design.  Yet the Ceramic Tools CT2555 doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out when it gets stuck between the plates.  It gets hotter, so I use it at a lower setting than my previous choice.  Very quick to get the job done, now.  I spend much less time on my hair.  Very pleased that I made the switch.</li>
    <li> My first few flat irons were cheapies from Target and a few years ago I got converted to expensive tools from high end beauty stores. I&#x27;ve been using those religiously, but recently my last one broke........and I was broke. So I went to the drug store up the street and bought this one mainly because it was on sale and I got an extra discount with my rewards card...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And OH MY GOODNESS this thing rocks! I showered and dried my hair and used this like normal, but late on a weeknight since I wasn&#x27;t sure it would make my hair look good. Now I&#x27;m wishing I had somewhere to go because my hair is so awesome. I have NEVER EVER been able to replicate a salon blow out at home, even with expensive products and tools....until today. ONE pass over my hair and it was soft, shiny, and straight. I absolutely cannot believe I&#x27;ve been spending $50 or more for flat irons that didn&#x27;t give these kind of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very course, frizzy hair and am always trying to find tricks to fix that. Apparently, the secret was a $20 Conair flat iron. AMAZING.</li>
    <li> great product, gets hot fast.</li>
    <li> Prior to buying this, I have had experience with a different hair straightener, which was my roommates and hers is the salon one, bought for like a hundred dollars so when I went out to buy a straightener.. what I did know is that I didn&#x27;t want to pay ONE HUNDRED DOLLARs.. but i also did not want to buy too cheap a straightener that would end up a disappointment sOo i went online and searched and came up this one.  What I liked, besides the price was the fact that it had ceramic plates so the moisture in my hair would stay and that IT would not dry out my hair.  Also it&#x27;s not too big or small.  Now I woould have to say that this is a pretty good straightener.. granted i have wavy THICK hair.  It doesn&#x27;t work as FAST as my roommates straightener but it WILL get the job done and that&#x27;s the main thing.  &#x3D;T  my hair is a little longer then my shoulder and it takes about 12 minutes to straighten my hair.  &#x3D;T nOt bAd...</li>
    <li> My wife bought this hair straightener at Walmart and it stopped working after four months of using it only two or three times a week.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron for my teen daughters - actually I bought it twice, since I didn&#x27;t have much choice where I was shopping.  Both times it died.  The first iron lasted about 6 months, and the second lasted 2 weeks!  Just dies, no warning.  My girls are begging me to buy them a decent straightener that is not a Conair!  I am going to invest in a better one this time and am doing a lot of research!</li>
    <li> Both my wife and daughter love theirs. They both claim it&#x27;s far better then others costing twice as much.</li>
    <li> unless you have really frizzy, curly hair, this little flat iron is perfect. my hair is really thick and wavy, and it still worked great on my hair. it&#x27;s also really teeny tiny so it&#x27;s so portable. loves it. i can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap, it works as well as the new one my sister got, which was $50! wth?</li>
    <li> I bought this to take to the gym.  I thought the small size would be good because my gymbag doesn&#x27;t have unlimited capacity.  I should have just spent the money/space and bought a decent regular-sized one though.  This one is crappy.  The ceramic area is so tiny, it&#x27;s really only good for touch-ups.  And I&#x27;d still be ok with it even in that capacity, but the two ceramic pieces are poorly assembled and do not come together flat.  They touch at the very end and there&#x27;s still a pretty decent gap elsewhere.  This means that you really only have an area maybe 0.5x0.5&amp;#34; to use to flat iron your hair.  Very annoying to use!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of the variety of settings, the compact size and the automatic off after one hour. The product arrived as promised and I was not disappointed. It met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> I got this one to see how it works in my quimical relaxed hair, I have to say the first times I was very impress about the results and compared with other friends who pay way more money for other profesional irons but after 2 or 3 times my hair was getting in bad shape and frizzing that&#x27;s when my hair styler told me that flat iron was not real ceramic and was burning my hair.  This product dont worth the damage</li>
    <li> I purchased this for traveling but find it does not work as well as my other Conair flat iron. I don&#x27;t think it gets hot enough for my frizzy hair even though the description was the same as for my other device.</li>
    <li> I got this product about two years ago and i&#x27;ve had some trouble with it. while it does to a decent job at straightening it would take at least twenty minutes for me to get my slightly wavy shoulder length hair straight. it pulls at your hair and takes about a minute to heat up. after about a year it started turning off randomly while i was straightening. i also recommend using a TON of product, because if you don&#x27;t, your hair will be wavy again in an hour. i just purchused the herstyler for $50 on amazon and i recommed that one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 16 and i have thick, frizzy, wavy hair. I bought this straightener a few days ago and I&#x27;m returning it because I fooled by the design and light weight feel for the iron. My hair didn&#x27;t stay straight for even a whole day. This straightener also pulls out hair. Trust me, it was awful looking down at the hair coming out. I also started to have problems with turning it on right after my first use because even though I had plugged the iron in and pressed the on button several times it took a while for it to actually turn on. Sure.....60 second heat up....but like a long time for it to turn on. My suggestion is that try this product and see what you think, but make sure you can return it just in case. However, DO NOT be fooled with gold plates and so called ceramic technology. I suspect the plates to be only gold-covered metal to seem like a high end straightener.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through 3 of these already. The \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; is not real and burns your hair, it dosen&#x27;t ever straighten my hair without having to go over it again and again, and it&#x27;s just cheap and messes up your hair even more.</li>
    <li> Excellent performance - SOOOO much better than other ones you can buy that are even more expensive!  Doesn&#x27;t harm hair, yet is very effective.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for my daughter after she cut her hair very short.  My standard size straightener was just too cumbersome to use on her and my hair dresser recommended a 1&amp;#34; or smaller version.  Who knew?  This straightener heats up very quickly and works great.  It&#x27;s size makes it much more manageable for my 13 year old to use as she&#x27;s just learning how to use hot implements on her own hair.  She feels safer with this one as it&#x27;s not so heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually chosen this straightener over my large one for quick touch-ups and find that it&#x27;s easier to get a flip with this one than it is with my larger straightener or large round curling iron.  This was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I also bought this product for one of my daughters!!! What a great article!!! Before this Ceramic Hair Straightened they where using a hair dryer and it was to noisy and it consume so much more WATS!! The Heat Ceramic Hair Straightened is quieter and faster also their hair are very straight and they look prettier!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product two weeks ago in a pinch (my old flat iron was destroyed after being used as a chew toy), and it has stopped functioning altogether. The \\&quot;Power\\&quot; and \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; lights will illuminate with no problem, but the plates don&#x27;t heat up. I&#x27;m assuming I was unfortunate enough to get my hands on a defective model, but buyer beware: Sometimes $20 for a flat iron is just too good to be true.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect travel flat iron. It is dual voltage, making it ideal for international travel. It&#x27;s also very lightweight.    Surprisingly, this flat iron is superior to a flat iron I bought for 3 times as much, that had far fewer features. I like the multiple heat settings and the on/off light, both of which the more expensive \\&quot;professional\\&quot; flat iron didn&#x27;t offer.    This iron straightens my hair perfectly with one pass on the 5 (out of 25) heat setting, but I do have fine hair that is wavy (not curly or kinky). The narrow size makes it easy to flip the ends of my hair.    I&#x27;m very happy with this inexpensive purchase!</li>
    <li> I have what I would consider the world&#x27;s worst type of hair, frizzes up easily, thick, coarse...so trying to find anything that works on it without emptying my bank account seems impossible.  I recently bought this flat iron from one of my local Target stores for $14.99.  The buttons are flat so you won&#x27;t accidentally turn it off while styling like their old model.  It does heat up to 25 in 30 secs on Turbo, which is great.  AND it really did straighten my hair fast, only took 2-3 times down.  I can tell this is an iron for for with medium to thick grade hair, cause if you try to do a super thin amount it won&#x27;t work as well.  But I&#x27;m glad I found something that works AND is very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have been continually disappointed with Conair products, and with this item, I have decided I will never buy one again! This is not a true ceramic iron (a friend schooled me)-- the plates are &amp;quot;ceramic coated.&amp;quot; So basically it&#x27;s a regular straightening iron with a layer of cheap &amp;quot;ceramic&amp;quot; over the plates. My hair did not achieve the promised &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; results, and went back to wavy in a few hours. Unfortunately, ceramic irons are one of those professional items you have to pay the top $ to get a good product. The same friend suggests either a Solano or Baybliss (quite reasonably priced).</li>
    <li> Keep in mind that this straightener is only ceramic coated and pales in comparison to actual ceramic straighteners. I bought this for the low price but with that came the lightweight cheap feel and the horrible results. The plates gripped my hair very roughly instead of smoothly gliding over it. I would not recommend this straightener at all. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this -- I have already returned it to Amazon and received a refund, which I used on the Revlon Satin Finish Ceramic Straightener. I highly recommend that one instead of this Conair piece of uselessness. It costs about $8 more but it&#x27;s definitely well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener about a year ago for around 30$ and i find that it works great. I have very thick long hair and i never ever pulled my hair with it. Im not sure if people are using it right.  I even had friends who use salon ones for 100-200$ and they are pretty impressed on how well it works. also if you want really nice straight hair blow dry it with a large round brush first, even people with expensive ones do that first. also i use it almost every day and i dont have damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of people complaining about this straightener, but it really does work well for me. It mainly depends on your hair type -  if you have very thick, bushy, or curly hair, you might want to use a more professional and high quality straightener, but if you have thin hair, or fairly thick and wavy hair like myself, then it&#x27;ll work beautifully. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have complained that the plates \\&quot;aren&#x27;t ceramic\\&quot; - actually, they are. If it&#x27;s burning your hair, then obviously, you need to turn down the heat, and there&#x27;s a dial on the straightener that allows you to do that, along with a guide on how high you should have the heat depending on your hair type. I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for a while, and my hair is not burnt, and my split ends have even reduced from switching to this one from my old one, and my old one used had been much more expensive and supposedly \\&quot;higher quality\\&quot; than this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This definitely isn&#x27;t for everybody, but considering it&#x27;s not too costly, there&#x27;s no real harm in just giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I have purchased and re-purchased this straightener multiple times over a period of several years. Eventually, the plates heat a little unevenly, but for an appliance of this type and for the price, this thing is amazing. It&#x27;s slightly curved so that I can flip the tips of my hair whichever way I please, and the plates are smooth and a great width. Use almost every day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this straightner for about 2 years, and it works okay but I have to spend like an hour to get it perfect and it doesn&#x27;t last all day like I would like. I have medium lenth wavy/curly/straight hair and although it makes your hair super smooth and shiny, I don&#x27;t think that I would reccomend it for those who don&#x27;t have a long time in the morning to make it perfect, but it is an okay straightner. I bought an Andis straightner today that I am hoping works better.</li>
    <li> I have naturaly wavy hair and I love my bangs straight. One swipe with this and they were perfect. It is light.Good heat adjustments. I could use it anywhere on my hair(Which is short,but not super short.)</li>
    <li> My wife used this in Amsterdam, Belgium and France along with an adapter, no need for a pricey voltage converter.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron about a year ago, and its not that bad and not that good. I agree with most comments, but the one thing I really noticed was that it doesn&#x27;t work that well when you really want your hair straight straight. It does the job to keep it straight for a few hours, and sometimes I have to go over my hair 2-3 times just to keep it straight. And...I have naturally straight hair. Its also the size - 3/4 - which is a bit small and annoying so it takes longer to straighten hair. If I had read reviews first about this, I would have considered another one - even if it cost more.</li>
    <li> The cord is always tangled and that cause the cord to become unplugged.Otherwise great.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS FROM ANYONE AT ANYSTORE!!!     IT GOT SO HOT IT BURNED MY HAIR INTO NOTHING THAT FELL OUT. I HAD TO GET A HAIRCUT JUST TO EVEN IT ALL OUT. SECONDS AFTER IT BURNED MY HAIR I PUT THE UNIT DOWN ON THE COUNTER TO LOOK AT MY HAIR. WITHIN SECONDS THE UNIT HAD THE CERAMIC PLATES METLING OFF OF THE PLASTIC!!!!     HEALTH AND FIRE HAZZARD</li>
    <li> I have naturally straight hair that tends to get puffy/frizzy when it drys naturally and wavy right in the front where its short.  I used this for so long that I actually wore the ceramic off after 3 years and now I am going to buy another.  It leaves my hair smooth and soft and only takes a once over.  It has never failed me and gets hotter than some straighteners that cost way more.  Its definitely not for people who have extremely curly wavy hair; its more of a maintenance straightener for people who need a little extra help.  I bought it for 13$ and now its 16$.  Still worth the money though!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first to buy it, but I thought because it&#x27;s so cheap why not? It came today. The packaging was weird but cute, the seller gave me a free gift and a 25% off coupon. As for the straightener, it takes a while to heat up, but it works good! (I used to have a chi) other then slowly heating up, it straightens my hair nicely and leaves it softer then my chi did. It&#x27;s not that much money I recommend everyone to give it a shot like I did!</li>
    <li> Really like this flat iron - particularly like the fact that you can regulate the heat.  Just ordered three more as Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my short hair. Love it</li>
    <li> I bought this ceramic straightener this morning and was hoping it would at least do a somewhat decent job on my hair until I am able to save up to buy a really good professional one like \\&quot;Solia\\&quot;. Let&#x27;s just say, \\&quot;YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!\\&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t even call this a straightener! It just sucks!!! I had to go over the same strips of hair over and over about 5 times! I have healthy hair and it still did not do it&#x27;s job and it was constantly tearing out peices of hair! I had it on the highest setting \\&quot;25\\&quot; due to my hair being medium thick and with a wave to it. It took me literally about an hour to do my whole head of hair which is all one length and stops a little below my shoulders! I was getting so tired, that I almost gave up half way through! In the end my hair still had a frizz to it and still had waves! What a waste of time and money! Not to mention that now I have the hassle of going back to the store to get a refund! Oh what fun! Don&#x27;t bother trying this one. It just doesn&#x27;t work!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some good and bad experiences with flat irons, but I have to say, this one has been one of my worst. It was the first flat iron i ever bought, for like $14 at Target, so understand here that you really do get what you pay for.     I found that this straightener is really damaging to hair and it did give me split ends, more than I needed, thank you very much. The plates were definitely not \\&quot;ceramic,\\&quot; I don&#x27;t know what they were but whatever. The straightner also gave my hair a pretty bad burnt-hair smell- not too attractive. Plus, this iron doesn&#x27;t even keep hair straight! If even do manage to coax your hair into being straight with it (it&#x27;ll take a while, trust me), it will go back to its orignial state in little to no time at all.     The heat settings were pretty bad, as well. It only had a maximum temperature of 68 degress Farenheit... most good straightenrs these days don&#x27;t even have that as the lowest setting. Additionally, it took FOREVER to heat up! And what&#x27;s with the curvy handle? It made straightening uncomfortable, I would have to keep puttng it down because my hand would hurt from holding it.    Basically, it&#x27;s a piece of plastic that doesn&#x27;t work too wonderfully. I currently use a SCHI iron, it works really well and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair or anything. I would recommend investing in a good quality iron, because this one is not going to cut it for almost everybody.</li>
    <li> The size and shape of this product is great, my only problem with it was the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;swivel\\&quot; cord and there is no \\&quot;stand\\&quot; to rest the iron on when it is not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those two items, everything else about the product was fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about a year and at first I thought my awful ends were due to the hair dye that I used recently. When I went to my stylist she said that it&#x27;s primarily due to the straightener. This product says to be ceramic, but it&#x27;s only ceramic coating so the metal under the coating was frying my hair thus damaging it.    I don&#x27;t recommend it all, especially for frequent or daily use.</li>
    <li> I forgot my flat iron and even my &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; flat iron so had to buy another one. I bought this at CVS for $22 (because I couldn&#x27;t wait and am at a hotel) so get it here at the better price. This one is good because it&#x27;s a little smaller in size (even better than the Revlon  cheapo) and the ergonomic curve is really nice!</li>
    <li> Granted, this is a cheap straightener, but I expected it to work better. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and strands of hair get stuck in the crevices of the plastic part. Also, I have more static in my hair because I have to run it over the same sections repeatedly because of the lack of heat. Not good for dry Ohio winters. I will say one good thing about it - the curved design of the handle is nice, but not nice enough to outweigh the negatives.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy to curly hair and I have used this iron for over a year now. 95 percent of the time this did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;It has caused me a LOT of frizziness and it just didn&#x27;t straighten it period! Mind you that many stylists have complemented my hair for being easy to work with. It&#x27;s never damaged my hair since I use a spray that prevents it from damage. I recommend trying other irons...the wet or dry I am going to try next. Do NOT buy this please...it&#x27;s a waste of your money. Save your money to buy a better one!!! :)</li>
    <li> This is the first straightening iron I ever bought, and I&#x27;ve had it for over five years.  It works really well.  It adds shine to my hair and straightens it nicely.  I can&#x27;t get the pencil straight look that my hairstylist gets, but it gets rid of the frizz and adds shine to my color-damaged hair.  As my hair grew longer, I bought a bigger straightening iron that was a total waste of money.  I used it a few times on a few different settings, but it didn&#x27;t give me the results it said it would.  So, I went back to my trusted little Conair.  I have a good feeling that I&#x27;ll keep this little thing until it dies.</li>
    <li> Love this little straightener works better than my $75.00 one.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it. Not too big, not too small. Great quality. Perfect for thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is awesome as far as functionality. The controls are simple to figure out. It heats up to the highest setting in under one minute. It has a blinking light which stops once the device has reached the desired temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally thin and &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; hair but it lays flat and always sticks to my face/neck (my hair is short). It added a lot of body to my hair as well as made it look less dull. I was able to style it in about 5 minutes with ease to the look I desired. It didn&#x27;t tug on my hair and I didn&#x27;t lose any hair in the device. When your hair is thin and breaks off easily, this is a rarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the cord is a bit short - and of course, with any type of heated styling device, you shouldn&#x27;t use an extension cord. Although this would be a non-issue in a higher seated bathroom outlet, I style my hair in my bedroom (the outlet is much lower). I don&#x27;t blame Conair for that considering most people style their hair in the bathroom. Luckily I am quite short, so with a bit of maneuvering I was able to reach both sides of my head. :) Five stars.</li>
    <li> I love this little straightener that packs a giant punch. Small handy size allows for ease in traveling and I think it does as much or more than larger products.  I get a sleek, shiny look in minutes.</li>
    <li> I suck at straightening my hair ,so straight hair useD to be a Dream that came true every time I went to a hair salon :)) but with this proDuct,I Do my entire hair(I have really long &amp; full hair)in about 10 minutes!!! I&#x27;ve seen some reviews saying about how it stopeD working after a week or so,so I&#x27;ll upDate my review if such thing happens to me,but for now I just LOOOOOOOVVVVEEEE it!</li>
    <li> Great for the price. I only used it for a week while in London, but it worked with an adapter. I have very thick hair, so it took a bit longer than when I use my typical straightener - but still got the job done.</li>
    <li> This instant iron is amazing!! The best part is its portable,has dual voltage and its as good as other expensive flat irons! It works well for me.</li>
    <li> Unless you have super fine and already straight hair. I purchased this flat iron for a trip aboard and did everything in my power to not need to use it. One pass through my fine, but slightly thick hair and the iron would have to reheat. That alone would take 10-20 seconds to reheat again. I needed a few passes through the pieces to get them straight, so the flat ironing process took forever, especially in a bathroom with only one plug. I returned this item upon my return.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair in a short bob (above my shoulders) and was trying to style my hair with the straightener I already had which is 1 1/2&amp;#34;. I know I needed a much smaller plate, this straightener is perfect. I use it for not only straightening my hair but also making beach waves. Heats up super fast and works really great.</li>
    <li> worked fantastic while in Europe!</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could travel internationally after I have nearly blown out  a couple of irons or outlets over the years.  I did use this with a converter as well, but for a heat producing item which don&#x27;t often work even with converters , it worked well.  Not as good as my iron I use at home but perfect for traveling abroad.</li>
    <li> Heats up really fast. Works really well. Only problem is that the cord is really short and I stand up to straighten my hair but I am also 5&#x27;10. Very worth the price.</li>
    <li> Not the best, but not the worst flat iron.  Good for short hair. Skip it if you have very wavy hair</li>
    <li> I am basically new at this, but I just followed the directions and it really worked well.  The only problem I has was that my hair is thin and sometimes I could not get the plates close enough together to run down the length of the strand.  I had to repeat the process and then found better results.  You have to be careful, though.  These straighteners get very hot so watch your adjustment level to avoid burning your hair.</li>
    <li> All I have to say about this product is in the title. I don&#x27;t care to waste any more time on this terrible product unless it prevents others from buying this thing.</li>
    <li> Love it I have short hair perfect size. .</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically for my trip to England since my Chi wouldn&#x27;t work with the voltage converters. It&#x27;s a good straightener for the price; since I&#x27;m used to a Chi then it didn&#x27;t work as well, but it still got the job done. It took a bit longer to straighten my hair with this, but it still worked, and it heated up pretty quickly too, which was nice. I didn&#x27;t mind using it temporarily or as a backup to my Chi. It works perfectly in England as long as you have the correct adapter.</li>
    <li> A gift to a cousin.. still using it after 1+ years of use. Still working as day 1 she says.</li>
    <li> It is v. Good and cheap .</li>
    <li> Not as great as I was hoping. I have to go over the same area multiple times to get out straight.</li>
    <li> she says it is better than any straightener she has ever had and she has had salon expense straighteners. thanks.</li>
    <li> Worked well overseas which is why I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Works great on short hair</li>
    <li> havent used yet, but i like the price</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on expensive straighteners! This thing is amazing and literally heats up in 30 seconds! great for your roots.</li>
    <li> I have been using hair straighteners for a long time and apart from another conair product that final died on me one day, this has been the best straightener I have found. The heat is right, it is 220 volt compatible, I tried it myself during a trip to England, the size is appropriate and light weight and somehow doesnt make hair flat like my previous straightener did. The only thing that I would have changed about this straightener is the width, if it were wider, larger sections of hair can be done at one time. Overall, a great, portable product that works efficiently. Must buy!</li>
    <li> I have had the same 2&amp;#34; straightener for a number years until it literally fell to pieces! So I spent several weeks researching for the best straightener for my curly/frizzy hair, which has long layers, a little below shoulder length and it&#x27;s thinning, too! I&#x27;ve had this new Conair 3/4&amp;#34; one about a week &amp; this iron is remarkable!  But first, I use a heat protectant/frizz control product (made for straighteners) on my bangs &amp; the rest of my hair. The #15 setting works best for me by really smoothing out my hair &amp; it takes care of those annoying frizzies around my face. Now, just so you know, It doesn&#x27;t make &#x27;my&#x27; hair straight as a board. I didn&#x27;t buy it to make my hair that straight, but believe me... it does &#x27;control&#x27; my frizzy/unruly hair and it gives me a hairtyle I want that really looks smooth &amp; full of body. I can even create soft curls. The curvature design of this straightener makes it super easy to use, If you&#x27;re in a BIG hurry for a quick touch up, the turbo works pretty cool, too! FYI... I don&#x27;t use harsh chemicals for straighteners or perms, and I don&#x27;t even use hair dryers.  I&#x27;m so happy I bought this!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a trip to Europe. I also bought adapters for the trip. The plug prongs are too large to fit all the adapters we had, so I never got to use this and had to buy one in Europe.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because it was on sale at Wal-Mart.  When I first got it it made my hair look gorgeous, but it gave my hair that burnt smell.  It heats up really fast, and gets really, really hot, but my hair is more frizzy now than it was before I used this straightener.  It gave me split ends like crazy.  Also, if you grab too much hair at once, it will snag in the area below the co called \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; plates, thus causing more damage.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron over 2 years ago and it still works great.  I have thin hair, and use this both as straightener and curling iron.  I have no complaints, only great looking hair.    P.S. I only paid $15 at Target</li>
    <li> Not saying it worked REAL well, but when you are used to a CHI, it&#x27;s hard to use anything else. It did the job well enough while in Paris so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about blowing out my $150+ CHI.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron, easy to control.</li>
    <li> This is my third straightener. They all broke because of me, not because they died. It&#x27;s a great size especially since I use it as a multi-tool. I can straighten my ridiculously thick, curly hair and also style my fringe. Great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I took the Instant Heat Ceramic Straightener to Scotland &amp; Ireland.  I used both an adapter and converter when plugging in the&lt;br /&gt;straightener.  Upon plugging it in the straightener started to smoke.  Unplugged it immediately and traveled without a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;When got back to the States and tried to use the straightener it no longer worked.  Trashed it and had many bad hair days while&lt;br /&gt;traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel, having recently bought a larger one to replace one that died. I actually like this one better; because it&#x27;s shorter, its easier for me to handle, and I mostly use it for my bangs. And, it&#x27;s dual voltage (the reason I bought it). Haven&#x27;t tried it yet out of the country but I am sure it will be fine.</li>
    <li> This puppy rocks..enough said! got here in one business day, can&#x27;t complain about that!</li>
    <li> I have natural out-of-control curly hair and I have it straightened in a salon. The hair looks too straight so I use this hair iron to make some natural curves at the end of the hair. This hair iron is easy to use and heat up fast. Within minutes, I have already made natural and lasting curves on my hair. I cant wait to try straighten the hair when the natural curves come back! Besides the size of this hair iron is perfect, not too big but good fit to my hands. Love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect size- compact but also does the job! I purchased this for international travel and it worked perfectly. I used it in France without a problem. It did the job at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is a really good iron for the price.  It works just as well as the one used on my hair at the salon.  I highly recommend this iron, its a great price and a great iron.</li>
    <li> Overall, I did it&#x27; s job of making my hair straighter, but not very well at all. It never makes my wavy hair perfectly straight, especially in the back, and it takes FOREVER to straighten my hair. If you are looking to buy a flat iron, I would definatly invest in a high-quality one.</li>
    <li> Very handy for traveling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a CHI flat iron for about six years, but it&#x27;s starting to die so I just wanted an emergency back-up to last me at least through the end of the semester. I tested it out a couple of times and it works fine for me. It doesn&#x27;t get really hot, but it still gets hot enough to work on my hair (medium-length, naturally frizzy and wavy). Then again, I also use product before and after I straighten to help control my hair, so that may be a factor that makes my hair slightly more obedient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it doesn&#x27;t get really hot, it does get ready to go super quick. The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button does help out with the more stubborn curls on the back of my head, saving time. I also haven&#x27;t had any problems with it being uncomfortable, either in my hand or on/in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the cord was a bit longer and that it would get just a little bit hotter for days when my hair&#x27;s just being too stubborn to flat iron, but for an inexpensive straightener, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> I use this straightener to seal mylar bags, it works extremely well for this task and seals bags instantly.</li>
    <li> Love this! Shipping was on time totally exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I just cut my hair into a pixie cut and was using my daughter&#x27;s flat iron, keep in mind she has long hair, and I kept burning myself. Went on to Amazon and found this little treasure and it is AWESOME! SO glad I got it and it is so quick to heat. A must have for my fellow pixie&#x27;s out there :)</li>
    <li> My number one complaint of this iron is the cord. Within a month, it was completely twisted; within two months, the cord was twisted over on itself.  I was forced to try to style my hair one foot away from the electrical outlet.  I got tired of bending and twisting over my counter; and the results were still hardly worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the narrow width is a major drawback.  I bought this iron primarily to create a flipped-out look, so I thought the narrow width would be an asset, as well as great money-saver.  However, I was much more pleased with the results when I used a wider flat iron, because then it would flip out more of my hair more quickly since I could hold more hair in a 2\\&quot; grip rather than a 3/4\\&quot; grip.  &lt;br /&gt;Also, the narrow width really added to the time it took to straighten my hair overall--because I had to go over each strand several times, or risk damaging my hair by moving it very slowly.  Plus, I had to use thinner strands of hair, because the width kept the heat from thoroughly heating and straightening thicker sections of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure that you would have to spend more money to get a better product, but I am sure that (1) the cord defect renders the product almost unusable after you&#x27;ve had it too long to send it back or have lost your receipt; and (2) a straightener is something that you will use often enough to justify spending the money on a product recommended by your stylist or a friend.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because my expensive one broke after a couple years of using it a lot. It has served as a good backup while i do some research and order a new one but I would not recommend this product as a primary hair straightener. It does not get nearly as hot as the expensive one nor does it hold the straightness for very long.</li>
    <li> On the way out of a store to go to another store to buy a $150 straightener I&#x27;d been researching, my husband suggested trying a cheaper one first.  He said if it didn&#x27;t work, he&#x27;d return it and I can go on and buy the expensive one.  I washed my hair last night... let it dry while I was sleeping and plugged the straightener in this morning.  In 15 minutes I was done and my hair was beyond perfect!  My husband is rarely right (don&#x27;t tell him), but this time he was right on!!!!  It rules!  I&#x27;m so excited.  I&#x27;m actually excited to go to work tomorrow!!  I highly recommend!  If you follow the directions... it shouldn&#x27;t pull at your hair!</li>
    <li> I actually posted a good review of this on amazon but i deletaed that one i started this one instead. It does straighten and all  but i notice after a hour or so my hair starts to get curly again. Another thing the plates are way to small it takes so long to straigthen my hair and most of the time i have to go over the same section of hair more then once. I suggest you go to place with a good return policy like target and try several out before you find the one that works well. Oh you can go to a beauty supply shop and buy one i am sure they have one at a resonable price.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and I&#x27;ve had it for about a year or so now. At first, I had a little trouble using it as I&#x27;d never used a flat iron before, but now that I&#x27;ve had time with it, it&#x27;s really great. It smooths my hair perfectly and makes it super-shiny even on medium heat. No burning either nor split ends..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to using this product to the max is to do the hair in sections. Clip your hair up in sections and work from the bottom layer up. You can&#x27;t take too much hair up in it or you won&#x27;t reap the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, thanks to this product, I don&#x27;t have to use a curling iron. The size of it makes it easy to flip my hair or creat cute little curls.</li>
    <li> I used this to straighten a kanekelon wig, on the lowest setting.  The wig wasn&#x27;t damaged in the least bit, and was still absoulutely beautiful.</li>
    <li> Good adjustable heat.  It takes some practice not to burn your face or skin, but the size is very manageable and more convenient to me than the full size straighteners.</li>
    <li> The item was exactly what we wanted it works well and does the job of straightening my wife&#x27;s hair well</li>
    <li> This Flat iron is awesome it leaves my hair with an soft texture my mom tried this out and she loves it the shipping was really fast and it was the best $22 i Spend now I can say goodbye frizzy hair</li>
    <li> This was purchase and gift, but it was the wrong size.</li>
    <li> I thank you for sending my flat iron I having used it yet but it looks exactly like the picture and it was sent fast</li>
    <li> Nice device, warms fast, easy and light weighted to use. The items is very good made and a well known brand. Now the proble is that my wife and sister in law want me to buy the bigger one</li>
    <li> This straightener worked so well on my hair! I have very thick and wavy hair and I have tried numerous methods to straighten it before. This was by far the best attempt yet. Its thin and easy to maneuver. It heats up quickly and stays hot and with all the different heat settings, you can play with it to find the best match for your hair!</li>
    <li> This model of Conair ceramic flat iron has been my favorite for years.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon to replace my old flat iron which finally, after years of service, gave up the ghost.  The price is very good, too--much better than Walmart or Target.</li>
    <li> Bought this specifically since it supports dual voltage and it got the job done. Its not exactly the best straightener out there. It can get too hot and I imagine prolonged use could damage your hair. Its decent enough for non-regular use, certainly useful for travel with a size that supports that function too.</li>
    <li> Item as described.  Giving as a Christmas gift so haven&#x27;t tried out yet.  Very sleek and attractive looking. My step-daughter will love it.</li>
    <li> Just did not get hot, warm at best. It felt very light and cheap out of the box. Never got hot enough to style my hair. Returned.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses hers all of the time. It doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;burn your house down&amp;#34; hot, thankfully, as she&#x27;s left it on a number of times and I&#x27;d find it laying on the floor. It does a great job for the price!</li>
    <li> good quality with affordable price!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good hair straightener.  Perfect size for shorter cuts.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a trip to Europe in May. I was incredibly nervous about using it due to horror stories about people completely frying their hair when using American straighteners overseas, but since this one is dual voltage I decided to go for it anyways. Well, I wouldn&#x27;t say that my hair was ruined, but my hair has never felt so dry. My natural hair is very curly, but I straighten it at least two times a week with a Chi. My Chi leaves my hair smooth and straight, but this Conair Ultra Slim straightener left my hair feeling fried and poofy. While some of the &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; was probably due in part to humidity, there was absolutely no excuse for how dry my hair was feeling (I use product to protect my hair from the heat). It also felt like it was pulling on my hair and it took FOREVER to finish all of it. I used it the very first day and then it went directly in the trash. If you&#x27;re looking for a dual voltage straightener for a trip overseas, I highly suggesting budgeting for a straightener purchased over there. Or better yet - just let your hair go natural! :)</li>
    <li> Better than my 150 dollar straightener</li>
    <li> Works great and I love the size of it!</li>
    <li> for the past few year have used Bespoke T3&#x27;s both regular and wet to dry.  assumed it was necessary to pay over $100 for a decent flat iron.  my hair is very thick with a lot of wave and cowlicks, shoulder length, bangs, choppy cut.  i use an argon oil thermal protector.  bought this as a back up flat iron for a trip since it has auto shut off.  first time out of the box LOVE IT!  hair looks better than it has looked in a long time.  will choose this one over my T3&#x27;s even after i return from my travels.  at the price it&#x27;s an absolute steal.  oh, if i have any criticism at all it&#x27;s that the cord is a bit short but not a problem for my needs.</li>
    <li> I bought this same model years ago and lost it only due to my dropping it (several times) on our tile bathroom floor.  This little straightener works magic on my very wavy bangs every morning.</li>
    <li> Just used in Ireland and it worked great! Some other girls on my trip said the straighteners they used didn&#x27;t work after the second day, but mine worked well for all 8 days of use! Heats up quickly, is a great size for traveling, and is a great price. The extra long cord is a plus as well. I would recommend to everyone in need of a dual voltage straightener.</li>
    <li> Did a pretty good job. Had to go over hair extra times but for the cost and little bit that I use it, it is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter (15) to replace Infiniti By Conair BC176R Pro Styler, Silver which were a return item due to potential fire hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves them and so do I.  They get very close to the root like a hot comb.  We are in the process of allowing all the relaxer to grow out.  Let me tell you ladies:  She looks like she got  a fresh relaxer yesterday.  Smooth and silky and her hair never once snagged on the plates.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a small, dual voltage flat iron to take to Europe with me. This one (which I actually bought at Target for the same price) will do the job well. I tested it out today and it worked really well - as good as or maybe even better than a full size flat iron. It&#x27;s light, and the length is easy to handle. I actually think you can get closer to the scalp because it&#x27;s small. I like that it has adjustable heat settings and auto shut off. It also has a turbo heat button, but I haven&#x27;t tried it. I have thick, curly, shoulder length hair and this worked great for me, I&#x27;ll probably just use it as my everyday flat iron from now on. And you really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
