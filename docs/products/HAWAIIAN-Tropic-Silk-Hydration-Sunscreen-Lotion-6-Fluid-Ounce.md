      <li>I liked it at first, but ...</li>
      <li>which is fine if you&#x27;re at the beach where people expect you&#x27;ll be wearing sunblock.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen has quickly become my favorite.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth just like lotion.</li>
      <li>But this one goes on smoothly, moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t make my face all shiny.</li>
      <li>This lotion is REALLY greasy - it seemed to come off very easily as well.</li>
      <li>And I love the fact that it comes in SPF50, which is something I really need since I burn so easily.</li>
      <li>That won&#x27;t be an issue since you&#x27;ll love the way it feels and smells so much!</li>
      <li>Have even added it to my monthly subscribe and save order, love it that much!</li>
      <li>Best non-greasy suntan lotion, smell is not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>This is the only sunscreen that I have had good luck with.</li>
      <li>Fragrance is nice (I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and had no problems, but your mileage may vary)  +</li>
      <li>After a trip to Miami where I used it extensively, I can confidently say that this sunscreen keeps my skin moisturized, doesn&#x27;t have that chemical-y sunscreen smell, and kept me safe from those pesky UV</li>
      <li>Its a high protection sunscreen that&#x27;s more like a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon has this available because I searched at rite aid, dollar general, cvs, Walgreens and Walmart this year and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
      <li>(I start to feel like I&#x27;m turning pink and burning uncomfortably pretty fast in the sun and am very fair).</li>
      <li>The consistency is probably my favorite thing due to the fact that it goes on very smooth and non greasy.  </li>
      <li>Protects as good as any other brand.</li>
      <li>Price is right  </li>
      <li>soaks right into skin...</li>
      <li>The reviewers are right.  </li>
      <li>but this product is a fine substitution in a pinch and doesnt perform so very far off the mark.</li>
      <li>I would absolutely  recommend this!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen for several years and love the non stickiness and smell</li>
      <li>I got my first burn in March this year and decided that was never going to happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t exactly say as a sunscreen.</li>
      <li>The hydration aspect seems to work pretty well too.</li>
      <li>This is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling like I&#x27;m wearing sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Will keep on using it till I can actually tell if it works for me. :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, non-sticky, soaks in fast, and works exactly like a sunscreen</li>
      <li>A lot of companies seem to forget us easy burners when making sunblock lotions and only make them SPF15 or 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unlike sheer touch, to me, the scent isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
      <li>I used it in the Caribbean sun for 5 days straight</li>
      <li>really like this product.</li>
      <li>I however wish I&#x27;d had this Hawaiian Tropic lotion as I much prefer it.</li>
      <li>In addition, this year I&#x27;ve decided to get around town on bicycle as much as I can.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This lotion is REALLY greasy - it seemed to come off very easily as well. I would not order this again.</li>
    <li> Best non-greasy suntan lotion, smell is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> This is the only sun screen that my son is not allergic too. He would break out I a or red rash or little red bumps with everything else. So we buy this whenever we can to keep a good stock. Poor baby and his allergies. Thank you Hawaiian tropic, without you my son would be fully covered and drenched in sweat or getting burned from the son. Keep making this product we love it!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, spreads nicely, protected my ginger skin from the caribbean sun - even in the water.</li>
    <li> Really nice scent and works well, no need to apply over and over again. Gives good protection against the sun.</li>
    <li> I spent two weeks in the British Virgin Islands and came back with a beautiful, yet not overdone, tan. I applied this sunscreen every day, sometimes a few times throughout the day. It worked wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Smells fabulous, and it really works to protect from harsh rays in Mexico.</li>
    <li> The reviewers are right.  This is the nicest smelling sunscreen on the market.  I was tired of spray sunscreens staining all my white shirts and hats, so I tried this stuff.  It&#x27;s not greasy, smells awesome, and doesn&#x27;t stain.  Do yourself a favor and try it.</li>
    <li> I used it in the Caribbean sun for 5 days straight and I didn&#x27;t burn once. I like the smell too, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the usual sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Works great for our fair-skinned family members and makes our skin feel great!</li>
    <li> I first bought this last spring when I came across a bottle of it in my local Walmart. I&#x27;ve used it throughout the year and needed to restock. I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon has this available because I searched at rite aid, dollar general, cvs, Walgreens and Walmart this year and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. This is the only sunscreen that I have had good luck with. It stays on well and I don&#x27;t get burned, but do get some sun. I like the scent of it and it does keep your skin moisturized. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells divine, is really moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave that white zinc residue on my skin that a lot of high spf products do.</li>
    <li> **Update - July 2016**  Just coming back after a couple years to update - this is still my #1 sunscreen of choice. I&#x27;ve taken it to theme parks, hiking, you name it. Just looking out the window and thinking about sun makes my skin start to sizzle... so I&#x27;m really pleased to have a sunscreen that&#x27;s consistently fantastic.  My only gripe is that the fancypants orange &amp;#34;hydration ribbons&amp;#34; are baloney - why add extra coloring just for fun? I see no reason to make them orange. Although I do a really decent job rubbing this in, I&#x27;ve seen others complain about color transfer. I&#x27;ve never personally experienced this, and I&#x27;ve worn the sunscreen with white shorts and a white shirt before with no issues. Still, it seems pretty unnecessary.   Please don&#x27;t stop selling this product! Finding a decent sunscreen is so hard.  -------  I&#x27;m kind of a sunscreen snob and tend to shy away from chemical blockers in favor of physical blockers (titanium dioxide/zinc oxide), especially since they sometimes irritate my skin.  However, this is a surprisingly great chemical blocker!  Pros:  + Rubs in VERY easily and leaves behind zero residue  + Price is right  + Fragrance is nice (I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and had no problems, but your mileage may vary)  + Great protection!! (The most important part!!!!)  Cons:  + Fragrance might irritate you if you&#x27;re sensitive  + Obviously you have to reapply (but this is the case with ANY sunscreen... is this really a negative aspect?)  I recently took a trip to sunny southern California, and I&#x27;m somewhere straddling between a 1-2 on the Fitzpatrick scale (I start to feel like I&#x27;m turning pink and burning uncomfortably pretty fast in the sun and am very fair). I used a physical blocker sunscreen on my face/neck/chest, but I used this sunscreen on my arms/legs/shoulders/feet everyday.  It did a really great job and the only pinkish color I got was in the areas I used my physical blocker...I think I&#x27;d break out if I used this on my face though!</li>
    <li> It works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it before leaving for the beach (about 30 minutes ride) and reapply to my face, neck and shoulders after being in the water a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My average beach visit is 3 to 4 hours in the late morning and early afternoon. I depend on it.</li>
    <li> Nice and silky product. It is what it says it is. Would recommend without a doubt. Wish it had more product!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen, is very smooth without being oily, and has been completely effective</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned and burn easily.  I use this every morning as my daily lotion.  Keeps my skin hydrated and safe from the sun.  Can&#x27;t beat that!  Have even added it to my monthly subscribe and save order, love it that much!</li>
    <li> soaks right into skin...no greasy feel at all.....feels like a moisturizer and best of all smells like I&#x27;m in Hawaii while boating on the Chesapeake Bay</li>
    <li> best sunscreen/lotion ever!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m constantly complimented on the fragrance (coconut). It&#x27;s moisturizing, non-sticky, soaks in fast, and works exactly like a sunscreen should (without the white residue. Just be careful to cup your hand before squeezing it in because sometimes the moisturizing (non-greasy, fast absorbing) oil can be a bit runny when it comes out of the tube. Just rub your hands together or rub it into your skin to incorporate the swirls together and you&#x27;re good!</li>
    <li> the best on your skin!!! not thick, absorbs easily and well, no foul smel, genlte coconut and vanilla, and does dam good sun protection</li>
    <li> We love Hawaiian Tropic Sunscreens!  This one in particular absorbs very well.  It doesn&#x27;t sting my kiddos sensitive skin like some sunscreens do.  It does have a that classic coconut smell, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming to me.</li>
    <li> This product provides great protection and gives a great tan- this is the only sunscreen we purchase. The 50 SPF is great for any thing south of Florida</li>
    <li> I love the way this product smell and how easy it goes on.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the non-greasy formula!</li>
    <li> I have always adored lotions which aren&#x27;t tacky and smelly. This sunscreen smells like summer and the beach, living in a sandwiched country, boy is it tempting. I love how it glides on my skin, plus having an utter sensitive skin I tend to get allergies. Thank god, I have not had any break out ever since I started using this. As a lotion, it&#x27;s amazing but I can&#x27;t exactly say as a sunscreen. Will keep on using it till I can actually tell if it works for me. :)</li>
    <li> I used to buy the sheer touch spf 30 cream but this one was on sale at walgreens so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It is great! Unlike sheer touch, to me, the scent isn&#x27;t as strong. Still nice but not as overpowering. And it is less greasy. The other one would take a little while to really sink in. But this one goes on smoothly, moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t make my face all shiny. I&#x27;d be shiny after an hour wearing the other one. But with this, even though I&#x27;m naturally oily, very little shine all day with multiple applications. I don&#x27;t use it on my eyes because I use an eye specific sunscreen, so I don&#x27;t know if it would irritate them. I&#x27;m also acne prone and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth just like lotion. Feels great. No clogged pores. Protects as good as any other brand.</li>
    <li> Its a high protection sunscreen that&#x27;s more like a moisturizer. It absorbs well, is non greasy, spreads on easily and has a great scent.</li>
    <li> Smooth, silky and perfect for sun protection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product. The consistency is probably my favorite thing due to the fact that it goes on very smooth and non greasy.  I have sensitive/oily/combination skin and this doesnt irritate me at all. I would absolutely  recommend this!</li>
    <li> Love this Sunscreen Lotion. I used it a lot when I went to the Carribean last month and it smells good, it&#x27;s like lotion, not sticky and I did not get sunburn spending hours in the sun..</li>
    <li> Do not use of face.  It is very irritating and burns.  Even on body it is irritating.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen! It goes on like a moisturizer and never feels goopy. Plus it smells great!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply--like lotion. Kept me from burning while on vacation. Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought some at the store and liked it, so I bought a few here on Amazon. Here in Florida you need to really use a lot of sunscreen; so the fragrance is starting to get to me. I liked it at first, but ...it&#x27;s getting intolerable. Too bad. I hope they make one fragrance-free.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen has quickly become my favorite. After a trip to Miami where I used it extensively, I can confidently say that this sunscreen keeps my skin moisturized, doesn&#x27;t have that chemical-y sunscreen smell, and kept me safe from those pesky UV rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to re-apply often! That won&#x27;t be an issue since you&#x27;ll love the way it feels and smells so much!</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen because of the many glowing reviews, but unfortunately, it didn’t work for me. The fragrance is unpleasant and very overpowering to the point that it lasts throughout the day even when I forget to reapply the sunscreen. I’m really sensitive to fragrances, so this really bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I dislike about this sunscreen is that when the weather gets hot enough, it seeps and stings my eyes, a problem I have with a lot of sunscreen brands. I think the only way to get around this while wearing the sunscreen is not to apply it around your eyes and to wear sunglasses instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this sunscreen is that it does what it purports to do and that is protecting your skin from the sun. I do give it props for not being super oily or sticky as well, although it does feel slightly greasy when you first apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m still searching for the perfect face sunscreen, and I seem to have better luck with the Trader Joe’s brand sunscreen. Until then, I would not recommend this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling like I&#x27;m wearing sunscreen.  It goes on much more like a lotion, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.  As a bonus, it smells great!  I&#x27;m a day camp counselor this summer, and I&#x27;m spending a lot of time in the sun.  This is my new go-to sunscreen, and it protects skin flawlessly.  I&#x27;m extremely fair-skinned, but I haven&#x27;t gotten burned at all since I started using Hawaiian Tropic!  My skin also feels softer and smoother since I started using it.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned, and I burn easily. In addition, this year I&#x27;ve decided to get around town on bicycle as much as I can. As you can imagine, this means I need to religiously apply sunblock every day before setting out so I don&#x27;t burn. I got my first burn in March this year and decided that was never going to happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried sport sunblocks, natural sunblocks, \\&quot;dry touch\\&quot; sunblocks, sheer sunblocks, spray sunblocks, and everything else you can imagine. All of them were super greasy when applied in the proper amounts (one tablespoon per limb) or left a white residue on my clothing. And they all had that traditional \\&quot;sunblock\\&quot; smell-- which is fine if you&#x27;re at the beach where people expect you&#x27;ll be wearing sunblock. Not fine when you&#x27;re just going around town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great. Not only is it completely non greasy, but it soaks in with minimal rubbing, dries fast and leaves behind a light floral scent. It&#x27;s basically more like applying a lotion than a sunblock, but I&#x27;ve yet to get burned while using this-- not to jinx myself! And I love the fact that it comes in SPF50, which is something I really need since I burn so easily. A lot of companies seem to forget us easy burners when making sunblock lotions and only make them SPF15 or 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is that once you use more than half the bottle, it becomes a struggle to get anything out. You have to shake the bottle, tap the bottle, squirt out tiny amounts, and it takes longer to get the sunscreen out of the bottle than it does to actually apply it. Especially if you keep it in your bag like I do. But, this is a minor quibble, I&#x27;ll be buying lots more of this product for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen for several years and love the non stickiness and smell and it works great for blocking harmful rays. I could not find it in our town.</li>
    <li> I grew up using Coppertone to protect me from the sun in Africa. I however wish I&#x27;d had this Hawaiian Tropic lotion as I much prefer it. It soaks in fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. When using this lotion I only stay out in the sun for about 15 minutes to half an hour at most. I find it is effective for that amount of time since I have very fair and sensitive skin. I like the moisturizing qualities and the intoxicating scent is wonderful. I&#x27;ll be using this when I garden all summer. It is also waterproof so you can use it when swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I use sunscreen every day, religiously, 24/7, 365 days a year, rain or shine.&lt;br /&gt;My performance/ application needs are flexible and minimal for my body but I&#x27;m very picky with sunscreens I use on my face, neck and decalletage. area.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is somewhat thick but isn&#x27;t overly greasy and absorbs to a slight sheen in less than five minutes. It is a little shiny but nothing a light dusting of face powder can&#x27;t hide. It does have a faint, tropical fragrance on application but dissipates rapidly.  I have a wonderful, but pricey, brand I use exclusively on my face under makeup but this product is a fine substitution in a pinch and doesnt perform so very far off the mark. Very elegant and pill free.&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomend!</li>
    <li> Great scent and protects very well. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and didn&#x27;t get any redness this whole summer while using this sunscreen. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on its scent while applying at work (I worked outdoors over the summer). The hydration aspect seems to work pretty well too.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve bought.  The scent is sooo wonderful.  I used it during my Caribbean vacation for 2 weeks while in the sun daily.  I never burned, which happens often with fair to medium complexion. My shoulders and face tend to burn the most. My skin is sensitive as I have allergies and I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to this product. It goes on smooth and lasts long.  My tan was came out beautifully too.  I also used After Sun Lime Coolada Moisturizer for extra hydration after spending a day at the beach.</li>
