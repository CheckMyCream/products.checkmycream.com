      <li>So far it seems to be tightening up the skin on my throat and really refining my complexion.</li>
      <li>It provides so much needed moisture for my dry skin and definitely smoothes some fine lines.</li>
      <li>Used it for first time last night.</li>
      <li>It made my skin feel soft and pliable, but I couldn&#x27;t see a lot of difference in tone or wrinkles.</li>

    <li> This is a great product, it works well and I will reorder it as needed.  One of the best skin care products I&#x27;ve ever used and I highly recommend this serum.</li>
