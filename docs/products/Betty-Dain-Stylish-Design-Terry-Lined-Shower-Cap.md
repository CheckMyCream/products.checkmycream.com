      <li>I am so glad that I found it.</li>
      <li>more than the ones made without it.  </li>

      <li>Well made and cute designs to offer.</li>
      <li>These are so much better than the ones you would buy in a drugstore.</li>

      <li>otherwise, haven&#x27;t found a better shower cap.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if it was defective, but decided to keep anyway in hopes that the elastic would &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; over time.</li>
      <li>It is really cute</li>
      <li>Comfortable and effective.  </li>
      <li>It is marginally better, yes, but is it 900% better to reflect the price increase?</li>

      <li>plus super girly and cute :)</li>
      <li>Love the style, love that it dries quickly after showering.  </li>
      <li>I love my new shower cap its very cute, and comfortable.</li>
      <li>and I have fine, medium length hair.</li>

      <li>Besides that, it works fine and feels comfortable.</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s HUGE and I have to buy another one.</li>
      <li>so if you have a lot of hair it will definitely fit in this shower cap.</li>
      <li>And it is comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>If it fits my head it should fit justabout any size head.</li>
      <li>fits well and is so comfortable with the terry lining.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great fit.  Feels wonderful. I have a smaller head and it fits nicely.  No leakage.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Omg! This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. It covers my entire head and fits tight just the way I like it! None of my hair gets wet!!! I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of different shower caps and have always been disappointed. They are too small, get my hair wet, leave marks on my head etc. This product is huge, has a soft rim, and no water gets in!!! It also never smells musty! It&#x27;s a soft material unlike plastic, but still totally waterproof!!! I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> Nice secure fit around hairline. Like the terry cloth lining - blowout continues to look great.</li>
    <li> Best shower cap I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been using one of those cheapo plastic shower caps, retire them.  I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t purchase this earlier, keeps my hair perfectly dry in the shower and it&#x27;s fairly large/roomy enough for someone with long/thick hair.</li>
    <li> Keeps the water out but the terry cloth gets kind of funky smelling after a while even if you keep it hanging somewhere with good ventilation.</li>
    <li> I loved this shower cap! It&#x27;s cute, comfortable and kept my hair dry until it lost it&#x27;s elastic. Now it&#x27;s HUGE and I have to buy another one. I thought this was of good quality. So now I&#x27;ll look for one that&#x27;s maybe a little more expensive. Disappointed</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice, pleasant to touch and has an interesting design.</li>
    <li> Great product, nice weight.  Covers my big, naturally curly hair easily.</li>
    <li> I never before new there was such a thing as a &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; shower cap, but there is, and Betty Dain Creations makes it! Well made, thick with a terry cloth lining. Love it. Keeps my hair dry, in comfort. I&#x27;m going to buy a 2nd one to keep in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> Love this shower cap.  Never gets gross like plastic caps.  Will last a long time.  Also keeps hair totally dry.</li>
    <li> Super cute and worked decently well (not completely waterproof after a long shower).  But in a few weeks lost its elasticity and became huge. I was disappointed it was so short lived. Hopefully I got a rare lemon, but not sure I want to buy this brand again. Going to try something else.</li>
    <li> If I use this shower cap along with another my hair stays dry in the shower.  I have a lot thick hair.  Product is well made.</li>
    <li> Nice cap, but the print is not attractive.  I am not going for fashion so this is not a big deal.</li>
    <li> But this is a well made shower cap. It is softly lined and keeps my hair from getting wet. I am curious to see how this holds up to daily use and may revise my rating at a future date. Has a bit of heft to it compared to your standard vinyl shower caps. The nylon is pleasent to the touch and not plasticy (not sure if that is a word) like the vinyl caps. I am satified with this purchase.</li>
    <li> How can you love a shower cap? You can love this one! It is very retro, looks ridiculous, just like all shower caps, and it keeps your hair dry inside, thanks to a nice terry lining. It&#x27;s so much nicer than cheap plastic ones. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is my second Betty Dain shower cap and both have been terry clothed lined so they feel great. Best of all the elastic is tight enough to keep the water out of your hair and the cap is large enough to place over a hair-clip or hair rollers, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I travel and use a hotel shower-cap I am cursing to myself because I have long thick hair and I always use a hair-clip to hold my hair up, but the hotel cap&#x27;s don&#x27;t even fit over one&#x27;s head with a hair-clip on, so I was thinking to buy a second one of these for my travel bag!</li>
    <li> very useful and holds up well.  be sure to let it dry out between uses so it won&#x27;t mold.  otherwise, haven&#x27;t found a better shower cap.  pattern is silly but cute (French motif).</li>
    <li> Love the style, love that it dries quickly after showering.  Just wish the elastic was a bit snugger.  But it does the job and I can now get under the shower fully instead of maneuvering around so I don&#x27;t get my hair wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 7/18/2014&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shower cap now for 7 months and it&#x27;s still like new.  Hair is ALWAYS dry after I use it and it&#x27;s held up extremely well!</li>
    <li> Very cute but funky smell that&#x27;s hard to get rid of even after three washes..,</li>
    <li> These shower caps are of excellent quality.  The terry cloth lining helps to keep your hair from going flat (due to the humidity of your shower) more than the ones made without it.  These caps last for several months also.  I wash mine on the gentle cycle in the washing machine, then dry on low heat in a laundry load of other items with the same washing instructions.  I wash the shower cap whenever the inside starts smelling a little musty.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  These are so much better than the ones you would buy in a drugstore.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars, but I found the elastic to be a bit too tight around my forehead. This is the second one of these that I&#x27;ve purchased and the first one was not tight like this one.  I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if it was defective, but decided to keep anyway in hopes that the elastic would &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; over time.</li>
    <li> Great protection!!! plus super girly and cute :)</li>
    <li> the absolute only shower cap that works for me.  this is my second one.  the first one lasted for two years with nightly use, so i&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty durable.</li>
    <li> I like that it is large enough for my hair and does not fit tight. It also dries quick. I have not washed it in the washer, but I read you can do this with no concerns.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;The Socialite&amp;#34; indeed. I have to cajole my wife into not wearing this to dinner parties. But it serves its advertised purpose.</li>
    <li> So cute comfy love the colors. Fits my long hair to perfection. Hard t make a shower cap cute but they did</li>
    <li> I like design and quality, but even after wash inner part still has that unpleasant smell I cant stand, I keep it outside in hope it will disappears.</li>
    <li> This shower cap is exactly what I was looking for.  It fits well, keeps my hair completely dry in a strong shower, and dries well.  I use it several times a week when I don&#x27;t want to bother blowing out my hair in the morning.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> does its job! Easy to clean and it hasn&#x27;t lost its shape and the price was good. Sister might buy one too.</li>
    <li> Works great, but had a strong weird smell to it. It took quite a while to air out the smell. Besides that, it works fine and feels comfortable.</li>
    <li> fashion and nice shower cap</li>
    <li> Great shower cap. Very well made and big enough to fit all my hair. Love the soft terry cloth inside.</li>
    <li> I loved the feminine design, the shiny polyester exterior, and the soft terry cloth interior. It felt like a luxury product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that this shower cap began to smell mildewy very quickly - after about 3 months of daily showers. I really loved it, otherwise. The smell lingers around the elastic band, so the smell will transfer to your hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Betty Dain shower caps can last for quite a while without developing this smell, but none with this terry cloth interior and pretty exterior.</li>
    <li> The greatest shower cap I have ever had.  Made well, fits good, and keeps your hair dry.  Lasts a long time.  This is my second purchase of this cap and the first one lasted about three years of daily use.  I practically felt like I had lost a friend.  Ordered two this time so I would not be without one.</li>
    <li> It fits and keeps your hair dry.  Comfortable and effective.  would recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this shower cap.  I like the terry cloth on the inside.  I thought it was a little pricey but it is a good quality product.  I would buy another one just to have a spare.</li>
    <li> Got this for my fianc&amp;eacute; and she looks so CUTIE PATOOTIE wearing this.  Makes her look like a mushroom capped Frodo&#x27;ette from the Shire but you know the saying:  Happy Wife... Happy Life!&lt;br /&gt;She likes the padding, the color and the fit.  I&#x27;d upload a picture of her wearing it but then I&#x27;d be sleeping on the couch for a few nights.</li>
    <li> On those days when you just want to rnse off - no hair complications! LOVE THIS CAP! Def recomend this!</li>
    <li> Cute, covers my hair and keeps it dry. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Perfect shower cap! No more frizzy hair after a shower and it doesn&#x27;t make the top of my hair flat like my other shower cap.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair nice and dry and is large enough for a lot of hair. Super cute too!</li>
    <li> Big enough to fit over my mum&#x27;s curlers and keep her hair dry, sturdy and pretty one of the best two shower caps I have bought recently.  Recommend  for its size and looks, don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed</li>
    <li> Cute shower cap.  Big and spacious that I can wear even with my hair in a bun and it covers my whole head.  Water does not get in and my hair stays dry. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this often, keeps the water out! It is also stylish. The stretch band will leave an indentation if left on for a long period of time (past 20 minutes).</li>
    <li> I was looking for a large cap to cover my long thick hair. I purchased another brand but it was far too big, better suited for showering with curlers in. This on the otherhand is perfect for everyday use, love the terry cloth lining, will order another style, with my next order.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I bought this for a gift for my daughter.  She loves it. Quality product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a while ago, but never got a chance to write a review. It is extremely protective of my long hair, and very stylish. A lot of people complained about the bad smell. It did have a bad smell when you first order it, but it was honestly only bad when I took it out of the case. After I used it a few times, it got gradually better. I would have originally given it a 4/5, but It&#x27;s been maybe 2 months and the smell is completely gone, so it really is a 5/5 product.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower cap I ever have! I am so glad that I found it. Very cute and comfy. I especially love the terry inside. Make it feel better than a all other traditional shower cap. and the hair wouldn&#x27;t feel got all sweat inside after shower.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and durable.</li>
    <li> better than I expected! fits well and is so comfortable with the terry lining. definitely a good buy</li>
    <li> I always buy this brand now. Last long. Great lining. Awesome styles. All of my kids use them! On my wishlist for future purchases. I have the leopard one and this one. No tears, no fuss!</li>
    <li> The inner lining and larger size is absolutely perfect for a shower cap...I will certainly recommend it to others when I get the chance.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cap. It isn&#x27;t super large but it does keep my hair dry and is comfortable. I replaced one that was super large and my hair always got wet because the elastic wasn&#x27;t tight enough. It dries quickly.</li>
    <li> This cap had a really strong chemical odor which smelled like a gas leak, so I am going to let it air out for a few days before wearing it in the shower.  It is really cute and I like the pink terry lining.</li>
    <li> Worked MUCH better on my long hair. Still just a tad wet on the neckline hairs at the back of my neck, but not top or side seepage. Since this is the best I have found so far, I will be keeping it.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t believe the other reviews but my previous lined shower cap was ready for the trash can.  All the ones I had seen in the stores were tacky and made in China.  So I tried this one and it&#x27;s great.  It fits my huge head and keeps my long hair dry, even at the forehead&#x27;s edge.  Recommend Highly!</li>
    <li> Nice and large so hair does not squish down and terry lining is great too.</li>
    <li> Very nice shower cap and is everything I would want from one. Tight but not uncomfortable, terry cloth lining so my hair breathes and does not get sweaty or oily, cute design, big enough to fit my hair in clip.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower cap I&#x27;ve ever had. It is a solid thickness and feels like good quality. The inside is lined with terry cloth, which is much preferable to the unlined variety. It holds all of my long hair. And it&#x27;s cute! Not as grand-motherly as some others.</li>
    <li> OMG OMG I LOVE THIS!!!!  I love how it has terry cloth inside to keep the humidity off my hair!</li>
    <li> Thick and comfortable, and holds my hair very well during shower.</li>
    <li> It has a lot of space inside, it&#x27;s lined with soft material, and it&#x27;s not too tight or too loose. Just perfect :)</li>
    <li> This cap works for my purposes. I have long, thick hair and the cap holds all of it- I believe other reviewers said the cap would not hold all their hair but I did not have this problem. Also love that it is lined with soft pink terry cloth. Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> I decided to treat myself to this shower cap after reading the reviews. I thought it would be much, much better than the cheap plastic ones that I&#x27;ve used growing up. It is marginally better, yes, but is it 900% better to reflect the price increase? Nah.</li>
    <li> Best shower cap! Keeps out any and all moisture and is terry lined so it keeps my head from sweating!</li>
    <li> I would love to give this product five stars, but it smelled so bad when I received it.... I had to soak and wash it three times in my sink to get rid of the smelly chemical odor. I&#x27;m not sure if the odor was from color dyes, but once I got it free from odor..........the product was great. It fits great and actually washed great without fading the nice color print. I normally wash new items before I use them anyway, but this cap needed a little extra. It also dries fast... Over-all I like this shower cap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. I wish they were more designer sexier shower caps available for women. I look so homely in these ridiculous looking shower caps. If anyone knows of a designer shower cap such as Chanel, Dior, Hermes, etc., kindly advise.</li>
    <li> The very first shower cap that fits all of my hair in the cap. I want another one but they are out. They will contact me when they get a new shipment.</li>
    <li> I needed a new shower cap wthi a terry cloth lining and a good tight fit that would keep my hair dry. This was an excellent buy, and the colors are bright and cheerful. when it is hanging on its hook in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I love my new shower cap its very cute, and comfortable. My hair didn&#x27;t get damp at all, even with my scarf under the cap. Usually my scarf and my hair would be wet not this time:).  I am very pleased with this product so far. Plus it was shipped very fast</li>
    <li> I like the print and material, but my cap smells weird and it is tight.</li>
    <li> Cute and nice fabric but tight elastic</li>
    <li> I have never used a traditional shower cap before, only a small towel wrapped around my hair. But that adds to my laundry and sometimes my hair would still get wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this cutie (Pink and white with Parisian themed pattern) because I have started cutting back on the frequency with which I wash my hair and I&#x27;m doing at home facials, now. This works great to keep my hair out of my face and out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little tight on me and leaves a red line when I take it off, but it&#x27;s not awful and I suppose that if it were any more loose it wouldn&#x27;t work as well. For your comparison: my noggin is about 21.5 inches in circumference and I have fine, medium length hair. I do think this would work well for longer, thicker hair if you piled it up first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vinyl outside feels thick and the terry inside is not \\&quot;too fluffy\\&quot;, but just enough. It feels like a durable product, will update this review if I learn differently.</li>
    <li> So, I use my shower caps to put conditioner into my hair and then put the cap on so I can finish my shower while leaving the conditioner in.  Unfortunately because this is lined with terry cloth, it&#x27;s not really ideal for this.  If you solely wear a cap to keep your hair dry this is fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this dozens of times now and my hair has never gotten wet or damp. This cap keeps out all moisture, which is exactly what I need since I have curly hair and even the teeniest bit of moisture will ruin my blow out. I&#x27;ve never had water penetrate through during 20 minute showers. I&#x27;ve never had water leak underneath the elastic. This cap is very small though and it will leave a mark on your forehead. I am very petite (5&#x27;1), and it is still very tight on my head, but again, it&#x27;s tight so that it keeps the water out.</li>
    <li> I decided to treat myself to a fancy shower cap instead of my ugly plastic ones or my old hand towel that i use.  I&#x27;m so happy I did. This is comfortable, soft, very well made, and adorable.  I can see how it can be a bit hot if you take really long showers, but I usually take quick, warm, but not hot showers, so I never had an issue.  It makes me feel a bit more glamorous during something as mundane as taking a shower or bath.  And with the quality of the cap, I can see this lasting me for at least a few years.  So chic and fun!</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife.  Haven&#x27;t heard a word out of her.</li>
    <li> wish they came in more chic solids not the typical &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34; pink. Not everyone wants to make their bath look like a female dorm room.</li>
    <li> I was excited to buy this shower cap after using a $3.00 Goodie one which sometimes left the outside of my head wet.  It has perfect reviews, and maybe it works differently for those with thick hair, but for my thin hair, this left my hair limp and sometimes wet.  The terry cloth falls down on your head so that it flattens it.  And the third time I used it, I came out of the shower and my hair was wet!  Therefore, I give this a 1 star.</li>
    <li> I does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it well! I&#x27;m not a pink girl but no one else is going to see me! I like the price.</li>
    <li> When you search for terry lined shower cap, this item comes up.  When you click on the other patterns in this same listing, some are terry lined and others are not.  Be careful in your selection.  See how the description changes when you select a pattern.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of problems with Amazon&#x27;s images and colors.  They do not always match.</li>
    <li> Super cute, super comfy and keeps the water out with plenty of loose room for my hair.</li>
    <li> Betty Dain Betty Dain Stylish Design Terry Lined Shower Cap, The Socialite Collection, Boudoir, 4.32 Ounce:&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY thick long hair and this shower cap works great for me. It covers all of my hair; the band fits snugly to contain my hair and prevent water leaks around the edges. And it is comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> This cap seems very sturdily made and will likely last a long time.  My hair is shoulder length, but layered and I find it a little bit difficult to actually get all my hair in the cap, partially because of the weight of the cap.  Once inside, the edges of my hair still get wet at the back, though less so if my ears are inside the cap which prevents washing them.  I end up having to restyle at least part of my hair.  That said, the cap does stay in place and I will continue to use it till I find something better for my needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a cap until now. I&#x27;m 42 years old and this is the best purchase. If it fits my head it should fit justabout any size head. The inside is a pink soft fleece material. The outside is a durable plastic material. Not to mention the design is great for any girls liking. It has a thick elastic bag that seems to hold its elasticity very well. I&#x27;ve used my cap several times and still no leaks. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this cap if you are looking for one.</li>
    <li> I really do like this shower cap however it is VERY hot while showering. I think that it&#x27;s the terry cloth and humidity because my hair ends up damp when I take it off. It is very large though so if you have a lot of hair it will definitely fit in this shower cap. The design is also very cute if you care about the aesthetics. It is extremely comfortable besides being on the warm side although I do take extremely hot showers.</li>
    <li> This will sit in your &amp;#34;Buy it now&amp;#34; popout on Amazon forever! I hate this feature and I hate looking at this stupid hat on my amazon everyday. That shower cap sucks anyways.</li>
    <li> Well made and cute designs to offer. I have one and I bought my mom one and we are happy with our new shower caps!</li>
    <li> Perfect for anyone that doesn&#x27;t wash their hair daily.  Generous enough to cover my long, thick hair without smashing it. Really cute too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a long time now and it is the first shower cap that does not let my hair get wet.  I use a wide headband and then put this on and I never worry about wet hair.</li>
    <li> I love it, it is cute, it does what it needs to do, and is lined in nice terry cloth. I might have a big head, though, because the elastic is a little tight for my head, LOL.</li>
