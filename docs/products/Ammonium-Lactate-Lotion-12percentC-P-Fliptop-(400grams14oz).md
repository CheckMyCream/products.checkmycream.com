    <li> I ordered this for my grown son. He has a dry skin problem his doctor has him use it. It is a better deal at Amazon than the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Decided to use this after using Am Lactin. This product is a little more greasy but has the 12% Lactin which is what the dermatologist recommended. I like the flip too much better then the pump.</li>
    <li> I have been using this now as a replacement for Lac-Hydrin 12% for about 2 years. My insurance quit covering it, and put me on Am-Lactin which just didn&#x27;t work for me. My friend says it is the carriers that are different. This isn&#x27;t as heavy and sticky as Lac-Hydrin but works almost as well. I need the extra moisture.</li>
    <li> Same product that my pcp had ordered for me.  Does a great job of softening the skin on my feet.  Product arrived quickly and gave 2nd bottle to a friend.  Will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> aaa+++ great transaction,will purchase again...thanks</li>
