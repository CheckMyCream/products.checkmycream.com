<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is my 2nd time buying these. I love these collagen eye mask. These are so relaxing for my eyes.&lt;br /&gt; It made my eyes so awaken, fresh and soft around the eyes. I felt so relax. It comes in 10 packs with 2 masks for each eye. Wash your face before applying the mask. Remove all the makeup. Then apply it for 30 mins. Then remove the masks and dont reuse it. I was so excited for this mask. I took photos and showed to my friends online and text few friends. My friends will try this mask too. Highly recommend this mask.</li>
    <li> These are so neat! In just 2 weeks i noticed a huge improvement to the dark spots undermy eyes. They feel funny the first time you put them on, but then it becomes relaxing. I love how they make my skin feel and the results have been great. Deff recommend!</li>
    <li> I love it! I do have and always had dark circles under my eyes and I am always on a look out for products to pamper my under eye area! This eye mask feels so good! And after it I have a refreshed feeling and my eye don&#x27;t look so tired! I usually do it at night  before bedtime while I am watching tv!  love that I can watch tv and have a mask on at the same time!</li>
    <li> These eye masks are wonderful! This is my second pack and I cannot get enough of them. They really firm, lift, get rid of those wrinkles, crows feet around the eyes and those dark circles are gone. I do not look tired and my eyes are not saggy, or dark anymore. I really recommend these to those women and MEN who works and stays up so late and wants to get rid of the tired look. My husband also wears these to get rid of the dark circles from working the night shift.</li>
    <li> great product...very refreshing and feels great on my tired eyes :-)</li>
    <li> Luxury for your eyes! My eyes felt so much more alive after this was applied to them. Skin cells were more radiant, firmer and more moisturized. After using these a couple times I did notice the fine lines getting smaller, not completely gone, but thinner probably because the mask left your face hydrated. Very nice!</li>
    <li> I used to use the paper eye mask and let me tell you it&#x27;s uncomfortable. This eye mask is great, it feel so much better while you have it on your eyes. I think the eye mask is improving the skin around area.</li>
    <li> Love this eye mask, No more bags under my eyes, I look more awake and refreshed. Defiantly recommend this to anyone looking to fix major raccoon eyes...</li>
    <li> so fare been working well</li>
    <li> I tried these for the first time today and they are sooo refreshing! It feels like a thin gel pack on your eye and I just love the feeling. I wanna use it in the morning next time right when I wake up because I feel like it helps you feel more awake. Can&#x27;t wait to use it more!</li>
    <li> It is refreshing, but quite messy. I read before that the liquid may spill, I was careful and it still spilled.</li>
    <li> This is the one I am looking for helping me to diminish dark circle and crow&#x27;s feet. Making me feel relax and resting around my eyes as well. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It does make my eye relax :)</li>
    <li> I thought these eye masks were too difficult to put on.  Also, once on they didn&#x27;t stay on very well.  I didn&#x27;t want the masks to go to waste so I apply the gel around my eyes before going to bed.  There&#x27;s enough of the solution on the masks to do that with.  I guess it helps a little but not noticeable to anyone else.  There are other collagen products out there that easy to use.</li>
    <li> Like the gold eye masks that I purchased from the same company I put these in the fridge so that they would be nice and cold prior to putting on my face.  They are slippery so I suggest that you are careful when applying to your face so that you don&#x27;t get any of the liquid in your eyes.  I also found that it was easier to apply them and to lay down so that they will stay in place.  I&#x27;m not sure about walking around with them on as I found that they slipped off if you are moving around too much.  The darkness under my eyes seems to have improved after I&#x27;ve used them for a while.  I typically will put them on at night and leave them on for about 45 minutes.  I purchased this item at a promotional rate for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I did not really see a lot of difference after I used it. Seems very cold when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these egg looking eye treatments! They are cooling refreshing and well, just plain amazing! I use a set every week and especially before going out at night. This is an amazing treatment. I highly recommend them. For me it is wonderful, however a friend of mine I gave one to had a burning sensation after about 15 minutes. Everyone is different and my reaction thankfully was the best and is still the best. Just be careful if you have really sensitive skin and test it out first to see how your skin reacts. There is a lot of liquid in the package and you can apply it to your skin to see the reaction before applying to your eyes. I hope that helps you out.</li>
    <li> I feel revitalized after using the mask.  I will have to use the product more than once to see if I see lifting and firming.</li>
    <li> This vendor source fulfilled order perfectly.  Nothing else can be said about this very simple order.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with this product. In fact, this is the best product that has really helped me in reducing wrinkles and dark circles around my eyes and thanks to it, my face looks healthier and smoother. Overall, great product that work for me &amp; I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> The amazing feeling that I got when I started to use it. I have seen reduction in the amount of wrinkles around my eyes, dark circle and eye bag diminish. I look as young and vibrant as I once did. I love this product. I will put it on my skin regiment.</li>
    <li> These masks are fantastic!  I have used them a few times, and my eyes look fresher... Less puffy and less wrinkly. And the results last for days.</li>
    <li> These collagen eye gel masks are AMAZING! I have also tried another brand of these,and they all work very well.I use these at night,and when I wake up in the morning,there is a noticeable difference in the fine lines around my eyes.Great spa treatment in the comfort of your own home!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased these to help with my tired looking eyes. I was pleasantly surprised at how well they work. After just one use, I could tell a big difference. The dark circles under my eyes were almost completely gone. My eyelids and the skin around them was tighter and the wrinkles were smoother. I&#x27;m so impressed by this product, that I&#x27;m going to purchase more as Christmas gifts!!</li>
    <li> I love the way these make my eyes feel, they have a nice relaxing cooling effect and leave my eyes feeling moisturized and refreshed. I also love the fact that they come in individual packs.</li>
    <li> My eyes felt AMAZING after using this eye mask, I mean WOW there was a noticeable difference the moment that I took them off. My skin felt softer, and so fresh. awake, revitalized. It was great and I swear that my raccoon eyes as I call them since I have dark circles looked lighter. I&#x27;m not going to lie here another thing that I really like about them is that they give me an excuse to lie down and put me feet up to rest.The masks stay on and in place best if you are in a supine position. I just put on some music that I like, lie back on the couch, close my eyes,relax and let the collagen do its thing. Buy it you won&#x27;t be disappointed, your eyes will thank you and people will ask you what have you been using since you will look wonderful!</li>
    <li> Very happy I purchased this product</li>
    <li> The collagen eye mask help me diminish fine line around the eye, reducing dark circle and eye bag. Using them make me feeling so good. I can see result instantly. The price is very reasonable. Highly recommended to everyone who loves skin care.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It suggests 30 minutes but I usually leave it on for a lot longer because I just love the way it feels on and around my eyes and I go about my business playing video games or watching t.v. after a shower when I get home from work.  It leaves the skin around my eyes soft and less tired looking and makes me feel refreshed.  The only thing I find bad is that to get the masks out I usually have to open the package wide open so the masks don&#x27;t slide around too much and its a bit messy way worth it however!  I also place them in the fridge so they are nice and cool when I go to use them.</li>
    <li> I got this product for review and am so glad I did! I love it!! I put mine in the refrigerator and I wear it while I am relaxing at night! I know it says to wear for 30 minutes but I keep it on longer because its so cool and feels so good! I liked the packaging but I do have to open it all the way to get the eye mask out and it is a bit tricky.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite eye masks. I like to use them when I take my bath. These stick much better than others I&#x27;ve used but you have to be prepared to relax. You can&#x27;t be doing dishes or anything while using them. They visibly firm my eyes and minimize my age lines and make them feel supple and youthful. Beyond that, they&#x27;re a bargain because you get 10 pair. I&#x27;ve purchased 5 pair for this price. Wonderful product bargain priced.</li>
    <li> These are the neatest eye masks I have ever seen.  I was a little scared at first.  After placing them on my eyes for the first time I was over that.  Wearing these make you feel like your in a high dollar salon getting a facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to apply.  They don&#x27;t hurt at all.  You just have to leave them on for 30 minutes.  Not long at all.  They are very easy to remove too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards you can see a difference in your eyes.  The puffiness I deal with is terrible.  These helped so much with that.  It made my skin so much smoother too.  I am very happy with these eye masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see the results of long term use.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have insomnia real bad and always have dark circles under my eyes and of course since I am getting older I am starting to get crowsfeet. I got these and was really hoping it would help get rid of these problems. I love the feel of them on my eyes and the work really well. The circles under my eyes are getting lighter and the lines around my eyes are starting to  reduce.</li>
    <li> Love this eye mask!!! No more bags under my eyes, I look more awake and refreshed!! Defiantly recommend this to anyone looking for the raccoon eye fix!!</li>
    <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been having insomnia. So you can imagine the bags under my eyes. It&#x27;s been puffy.. And so not pretty. But with these eye mask. It&#x27;s been helping with the swelling and the bags. Plus it&#x27;s making my wrinkes around my eyes less visible .. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, in the short time that i have used it, it has helped reduce the dark circles under my eyes.  They have also reduced the puffiness and the crows feet.  I have found a great product that i will continue to use.  thanks for the great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, worked remarkably well in diminishing the dark circles and wrinkles around my eyes. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love it. Making round my eye skin smooth, fine line diminish. Eye bag and dark circle reducing. I love collagen skin care product. Thump up. Will come again.</li>
    <li> Used it only one night and saw amazing results.  These can be used daily or just for special occaisions if you&#x27;re pinching pennies.  I will definitely be purchasing more.  Glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative comments.  After years of sun damage and living in the South, my skin is not what it used to be.  Loved it and will be getting more for other areas.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions but saw no difference at all in my under eye circles or puffiness.</li>
    <li> I just love these! They feel great on the skin. Relaxing. My skin looks radiant and smooth! These are a blessing!!</li>
    <li> The Collagen Crystal Eyes Mask Full are really nice. You just place them on your eyes and wait for 30 minutes.  They stay on well enough to just go about your way. Use them twice a week for best results. They come in a package of ten.  Love them.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE!!! They really make a difference. I will order again!</li>
