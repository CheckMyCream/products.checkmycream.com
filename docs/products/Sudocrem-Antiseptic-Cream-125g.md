<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27; works just as description.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my eczema, but didn&#x27;t flare it up either. Made my acne a bit worse. The cream is very thick and oily when washing it off. It is very cheap, so I guess it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> Pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy my friend from England recommended this product to me. Everything I tried in the states didn&#x27;t help my sons diaper rash. This cream works like a charm on his skin and I will keep buying it for him and future babies ;)</li>
    <li> i had been told how good this was for eczema,  ya, ya,. i bought so many creams that said, it was great, i did buy this sudocream and  yes,&lt;br /&gt;i am very glad that i did, my eczema was so bad,  , i took bleach bath, showered it off and put this on right away, next morning, my scratches weren&#x27;t raw from scratching, . cant thank mr. smith from Ireland for making this great cream.  .</li>
    <li> This stuff is a dream come true! I suffer from horrible hormonal acne that i got from being pregnant and breastfeeding ,this is the only stuff that helps heal my skin and not make it so red and painful. The trick with the sudocrem is that less is more.Works best for cystic acne.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. I use it for my acne and dry skin. I got it in the first place because I needed an antifungal/antibiotic ointment for dry cracks on the sides of my mouth caused by a mild infection. Sudocrem worked liek a charm. I have also used it for ingrown hairs. It works overnight!!! This is my favorite everything medicine.</li>
    <li> This is the first review that I have written - I had to write one for this product.    If you have one cream in your shelf - it has to be Sudocrem.  My best friend gave me one when my daughter was a few weeks old, as a diaper rash cream.  But looks like I use it on myself more than on my daughter.  The mild cream and the sweet smell of lavender is a wonderful combination.  I use this for extreme dry skin, rashes, burns, shoe bites, bug bites and even other spots on the skin. It completely stops the itiching, and leaves a layer on to protect the skin.   This product lasts for a lifetime - you need to use very less, so it is great value for money. This cream is very thick and spreads easily.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, nice texture but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help my seborrheic dermatitis at all. It dries the skin, doesn&#x27;t help on the pimples.. and those were the main reason I got it.&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping it in case any issues like little cuts, abrasions etc happen :)</li>
    <li> not as affective as the 1st time use</li>
    <li> My toddler has been having severe nappy rash for the past week. I&#x27;ve tried desitin creamy, and desitin orginal. The former calmed down the rash but didn&#x27;t get rid of the blisters, the latter aggravated the problem. I was at wit&#x27;s end when I chanced upon this unheard of cream in a baby shop yesterday. I was desperate cos my toddler was in pain from her rash and we didn&#x27;t take any cream out with us. The cream was also cheap compared to the brands I&#x27;ve used or was thinking of buying.     I used it twice on her yesterday, and today all the rashes and the blisters are gone, even though she had been sleeping in a wet nappy! This has just saved me an expensive trip to the doctor, and I&#x27;m going to stock up on this!    P.S I&#x27;ve googled this and apparently this works well on slight acne too(says on the bottle it works on acne, bed sores, ezema).</li>
    <li> This cream is fantastic! I grew up with it and my mother would use it pretty much for anything from sunburns to cuts and scrapes. A few months ago I used it after my daughter develop a nasty  eczema which nothing appeared to soothe.  Well, the morning after I applied the cream my daughter&#x27;s rash appeared not as red and the skin not as sore. Trust me, this cream is a must have in your medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> After having read that this cream is excellent for taking care of breakouts, I&#x27;ve been dying for it to be sold in the US. Once I saw it, I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very thick, white cream (as most diaper rash creams are). The smell is light and not unpleasant. I&#x27;ve smeared it on burns, a healing cut and my breakouts. It worked wonders on the first two things and had a minimal effect on the latter.</li>
    <li> my friend and her sister use this for their babies. we all have babies with a tendency towards diaper rash.  sudocreme goes on smooth, sticks to the skin, a little goes a really really long way.  but my daughter seems to be allergic to it.  :-(  we&#x27;re using aquaphor for diaper creme now.</li>
    <li> I like this product for night time use. Because it contains wax and zinc oxide, it leaves a thick white residue and can be a little thick to apply. However once you smooth it out, while you still have that white film ala Japanese kabuki theater, it does seem to work as an antiseptic. I use it post chemical peel and on recent breakouts</li>
    <li> 5 stars all the way !&lt;br /&gt;Beat baby bottom cream no more rashes !&lt;br /&gt;Amazing cream if you have a baby try it. !</li>
    <li> Oh. My. God.  This stuff is AMAZING!!!!!  My daughter has super sensitive skin, so we were going through diaper rash cream like mad and we tried everything on the market.  One of the things that makes sudocrem different is that it has a mild anesthetic in it as well, so it KILLS the pain your child is in with the rash.  My thoughts on this are:  Use an \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; solution when you&#x27;re in pain, see how much you like it.  Don&#x27;t torture your child for your beliefs... When somebody is in pain is not the time to go green.  The biggest thing to get used to with Sudocrem is how little you have to use.  Less is definitely more in this case.  If my girlfriend hadn&#x27;t been here to show me, I probably would have gone through more than I have and it works better with just a thin layer.  I have had this 125g size tub for 5 months now and it&#x27;s probably missing 10g, maybe 15g out of the tub.  The rest of the world has been using this and swearing by it for decades!  This works on:  Acne  Scrapes  the irritating line you get under your breasts from underwire bras  bags under your eyes  My friend&#x27;s kid was at my house and she has eczema and my friend forgot to pack her stuff for it.  I put the Sudocrem on it and now my friend uses it on her all the time because it cleared her right up.  This stuff is so amazing I was tempted to rub it on my checkbook to see if it would help my finances (Momma needs a new pair of shoes!)  Seriously, though.  I have yet to find anything that this stuff DOESN&#x27;T help with... as far as skin goes!</li>
    <li> great for many problems with the skin</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Sudocreme by my Dutch neighbors while overseas when my child had a diaper rash in 2006...IT IS THE BEST. Before leaving I bought a big jar since it was so good. I recently ran out and was so excited to see it has been added to Amazon. I have tried Bordeaux Butt Paste, Destitin, Vaseline, AD, and none of these can compare to how wonderful Sudocreme works. VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream out there for the diaper area that I have tried for babies.</li>
    <li> As all ways excellent product great service.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with acne on and off for 10+ years. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything. When I have the time to sit with some Sudocrem on my skin (face, back and chest) it GREATLY reduces the redness and even makes some spots disappear. It is a bit oily feeling, so I don&#x27;t recommend sleeping in it (unless you don&#x27;t mind waking up in an oily mess all over you and your sheets). The longer you have it on, the better, though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother because she is bed bound and was having trouble with bed sores. This worked awesome. You don&#x27;t need a lot and it is fragrance free. I also used it on a bad pimple I had on my face and it cleard it up with out leaving a bad scar.</li>
    <li> This is my first review I have ever written for Amazon even though I have been a customer for over 10 years. That in itself should tell you this product is fantastic. I am a long-term sufferer of a troubling combination of recurring gram negative folliculitis combined with eczema and dermatitis on my face. I have used an entire arsenal of oral antibiotics, topical antibiotics, soaps, creams, ointments, tonics, spot treatments, and more. Through the first week, no topical product has given me the great results of Sudocrem.  The ingredient list is rock solid and with just an hour of your own research, you will find that out yourself. Zinc oxide, which is a very effective skin protector, seals in the disinfecting abilities of benzyl alcohol and the healing abilities of benzyl benzoate. This simple combination, along with a few other ingredients, make up Sudocrem. It&#x27;s impressive to see how just a few (and relatively mild) ingredients can help so many skin issues. Folliculitis, rashes, minor infections, eczema, dermatitis, acne, rashes, razor burn, scratches, and beyond. I just dab some cream on my finger, rub it into the affected area, and I&#x27;m on my way to healing. Applying Sudocrem overnight helps me dull pain, lessen inflammation and redness, and help the overall healing process. If you are experiencing any frustrating skin issue, there is a great chance that Sudocrem can help fight it or even proactively prevent it. It&#x27;s fairly cheap and you need just a tiny amount per use so it&#x27;ll last a long time. Good luck to you with whatever issue you are using Sudocrem to solve.</li>
    <li> This cream cleared my sons diaper rash in a day.  Definitely worth giving a try if nothing else on the stores are working.  Worked better then the pediatricians recommendations.</li>
    <li> I was involved in a head on collision exactly 1 one month ago. I was left with a horrific seat belt burn from my shoulder to my hip. Sudocrem was recommended to me by a friend to sooth the burn. Sudocrem is fantastic, my burn is healing quickly and it is hardly tender to the touch anymore. While I don&#x27;t have any stories about it working on diaper rash or healing my acne... I am beyond thankful I took my friend&#x27;s advice. I will be recommending this to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, really clears your skin. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I waited a month for this cream. &amp; it&#x27;s worth the wait! My two kids suffer from eczema. This cream helps with flares, itching, &amp; redness. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent diaper rash cream!   My daughter had a horrible diaper rash that came with teething.   Nothing worked.   I tried over OTC cream imaginable, you name it, I tried it.   I also had the doctor prescribe me several creams.   Nothing worked.   I felt so bad for my poor daughter, how red her bottom was that she wouldn&#x27;t even let me touch her.   I wanted to cry with every diaper change.   Read stuff on the internet, tried yogurt to help soothe, tried mylanta which was supposed to help with the acidity from the teething.   Some did help and give relief, but nothing would take it away!   One of the children at daycare used this cream and the childcare workers told me that the child never had a rash.   I was so desperate, I bought it and have NOT stopped using it!   My medicine cabinet is stocked with it!   I use it for every diaper change and she has not had a rash again!  When she teethed the next time, her rash started, one application of the cream and the rash was gone!  This is a must have for infants with sensitive skin who easily get rashes and nothing works to get rid of them!!!</li>
    <li> I could not stop my itching in an unmentionable backside area. Tried everything and Sudocrem is all that worked.&lt;br /&gt;Saved me from a lot of misery.</li>
    <li> Great balance of healing and drying. Also smells decent.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Just takes a while to arrive as it ships from Great Britain.  Great price for the product though.</li>
    <li> I swear by this cream. I ordered this from amazon and this works great. I am a new mom and my newborn son developed diaper rashes eventhough I put desitin in every diaper change and only use sensitive disposable diapers for my son. I tried all diaper creams in the market, but nothing worked as good as this product. My best friend who is a NICU nurse in Ireland suggested that I try look for this product here in the US, I called all drugstores and they said they&#x27;ve never heard of it. My best friend found it on amazon and she immediately informed me. I had this shipped right away from amazon (thankfully they have it!), this worked great and I never stopped using it for every diaper change. It also worked great on my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> Sudocrem works wonders on my sensitive skin.  If my skin is breaking out I use this as a night cream, in the morning the improvement is remarkable.  The cream goes on very thick and has a strong minty odor but it really works.</li>
    <li> My baby daughter had a red rash around her neck, but after applying the sudocrem, the rash disappeared within 2 days.</li>
    <li> good product, i use this product as face mask, whenever my skin is under bad condition, it works for my skin very well, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It works really well. I, along with many other people, have noticed that my skin has noticeably improved. Buying it was not as simple as buying some other skincare product at let&#x27;s say, a pharmacy but it was worth the wait. If you&#x27;re hesitant about the price, don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s worth both the money and the time delivered (unless you&#x27;re using Amazon Prime). It&#x27;s very effective.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me and actually made my eczema worse.</li>
    <li> The only thing that  has worked for my skin is proactiv but I hate how it bleaches everything. I put this on at night and it seems to make my pimples fewer, smaller and much less red. The more it&#x27;s used the better it seems to work. And no worrying about drying the skin. This hasn&#x27;t made my skin spotless but it&#x27;s certainly a major improvement. And it&#x27;s also helpful for any kind of rash/scrape/etc.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are all non-comedogenic. I waited a little over two weeks to see how Sudocrem works before writing this review. It took a few days to come to me in the U.S. For $8 you should definitely give it a shot.  Let me start by saying that I have mild acne. I used to have moderate acne until I finally went to see my dermatologist. I now use what my dermatologist suggested Aquanil (sensitive face cleanser), Cerave (sensitive face moisturizer), and Tazorac (topical prescription. I am just giving you my routine it may also work for you but of course you should see a dermatologist.  On to the Sudocrem, you should figure out how it works best for you by trying out different methods. I originally started by applying all over my face but now I only put it on new and old spots. It is not necessary to put it all over because it is really for post blemish appearance not prevention. I initially put on my moisturizer all over and then put the Sudocrem on. However, I noticed that when I did not put moisturizer over my spots the Sudocrem worked a lot better so make sure to not put your lotion or moisturizer over the spots you are going to put Sudocrem on. I apply it at night and by the morning the white has faded to become almost unnoticeable. It does not work well on blemishes that you can feel coming on. It does work on scars, newly formed acne, and open wound acne.  Pros:  -Heals new acne (lightens, reduces size, eventually and often completely disappears within a day to a few days)  -Fades scars  -Great price for the size of container  -Good smell  Cons:  -Makes your face slightly white</li>
    <li> At 54 years old I developed Adult acne on my chin area. I read about this product in Allure Magazine, was only able to buy it online and am glad i tried it.  This cream took about 6 days, without drying my skin, to be bump and blackhead free.  Nothing else has done this without peeling, burning or drying area at all.  If you are mid 50s with dry and aging skin I recommend this, great for dry chapped lips too!</li>
    <li> Baby  butt is well improved, diaper rash cream is very good.No prominent flavor, suitable for baby use.It is after the purchase, because the seller did not transport information, it is not convenient</li>
    <li> Best stuff for diaper rash ever.  I tried everything in the US and this is the only thing that will clear up my baby&#x27;s diaper rash.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this but it&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not great. I recently suffered from a dry patch on my shoulder area and decided to test this out. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week with little to no results. I will say you get a lot of product, and the expiration time frame is pretty good. I will keep this around and use as needed, but I will not repurchase. Shipping was a little slower, because I believe this came from overseas. I actually forgot I ordered this when I finally received it in the mail.</li>
    <li> Did not work as advertised</li>
    <li> I use this cream on all kind of skin issues...dry, cracked, acne, it works on it all. It also has a soothing lavender scent which is nice. I have had great results with this and plan on continuing to use it. It is a small tub, but it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> works well and it dosen&#x27;t stink which is a nice suprise. i would buy this again but i shouldn&#x27;t need to buy it for some time a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> My son occasionally has diaper rash that will not go away using A&amp;D Ointment nor Desitin.  I saw this on Amazon and the reviews were what made me try this product.  It created a barrier and allowed the rash to clear up within a day.  It has a more pleasant fragrance than A&amp;D or Desitin but not overly so.  I would recommend trying this cream if you&#x27;ve tried everything else without results.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle cream. I use it for my kids with any pimples, cuts, scraps, rashes, burns. Works like magic</li>
    <li> My mother in law in Scotland kept recommending that we use this cream for our son&#x27;s terrible rash.  Anyone we would tell about his rash would say \\&quot;Try Sudocrem.\\&quot;  We always said \\&quot;no, we&#x27;ve got a good cream.\\&quot;  Because there was some lying around my mother-in-laws house, we happened to use it and - VOILA!  The diaper rash got better within days.  I don&#x27;t know what is different about it, but we asked our pharmacist friend if there was anything on the shelf in US drugstores with the same active ingredient and she said no.  So now we order off Amazon.  It is considerably more expensive than buying it in the UK, but the shipping from UK would be exhorbitant and it is actually still cheaper than Burts Bees cream...</li>
    <li> This cream will clear a diaper rash on my daughters bum twice as quick as any other cream. Highly recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Best after-sunburn,diaper rash  and anti-itch cream extant</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that my youngest son has had some terrible diaper rash while he&#x27;s been teething.  TERRIBLE!  I have tried just about every product that my local drug store had and then I went to his doctor and she prescribed some prescription diaper rash cream.  The prescription formula was the only product that worked but my doctor said that he could only use it for a short time because it could damage his skin and he would build up immunity to it.  So I searched the internet for a cream that might help us.  I read review and review and settled on two - Mustela Stelactiv and Sudocrem.  The Stelactiv worked pretty good for us but the Sudocrem worked even better!  I am amazed at how fast my son&#x27;s diaper rash clears up with this stuff.  I am now in the process of ordering another one of these - just to have an extra on hand.  I understand that all children are different and some react better to some diaper rash creams than others.  All I want to say is that if you are having a tough time clearing up diaper rash you might want to give this one a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Amazon addict and I typically only review things if they are really good or really bad. This stuff, I don&#x27;t know why or how, but it&#x27;s magic. My daughter has a had a horrible red rash on her bum since she started potty training two months ago, first from the pullups, then from the potty chair we had purchased. Nothing would help her poor sensitive skin. We tried everything that typically works, vaseline, Desitin, Vanicream, steroid ointment, Cortisone Ten Eczema cream (which used to work, but does nothing anymore, and apparently thins the skin) changing her potty chair, changing her soap that was NEVER an issue before. Nothing helped her, and I was seriously starting to lose sleep over it. A friend of mine recommended this, and I finally was like why not? Considering I had literally tried EVERYTHING else for the rash on her bum, and her eczema. Within ONE application the stubborn rash on her bum was gone OVERNIGHT and the eczema all over her arms was less red, and it just got better and better within a couple of days after that one application. We only bath her every other night to avoid drying out her skin. sI also bought dechlorination tablets for her tub and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Baby Mild soap, which I think has helped with not re-drying out her skin, but the credit goes all to this stuff for getting rid of the rashes for sure. I also have tried putting it on my face to help with acne and redness. I&#x27;ve tried everything in that respect too, and with just a couple applications, the redness and scar marks I&#x27;ve had on my face have lessened. I haven&#x27;t had any new pimples either. Who knows if it will continue to work for the acne, but I&#x27;m satisfied enough with what it did for my child. It also smells really good, sort of like a Crabtree and Evelyn store, lavender like. :)</li>
    <li> Did not work on my kids acne but hey I try everything.  I&#x27;m sure this does what it says...... will try on my Dads eczema!</li>
    <li> This stuff works GREAT. My 2 year old has had a persistent diaper rash for weeks. As an RN I&#x27;ve tried everything, prescription and OTC. I read up on Sudocrem and figured I would give it a shot. The rash improved immediately and after a week is almost gone. I wish they would sell this stuff in the States!</li>
    <li> But it for my wife, it was used to clean her comedones， seems useful she said</li>
    <li> Was recommended by an internet forum to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Mostly use it for healing skin.&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice and it&#x27;s a good price.&lt;br /&gt;Also feels good, it&#x27;s airy but goes on thick.&lt;br /&gt;Not a miracle solution, but haven&#x27;t had any complaints.</li>
    <li> I had a persistent rash on my chest from something I got in the hospital and the Sudocrem certainly helped make it go away. I&#x27;ve used it on bug bites, burns, and even pimples with similarly positive results. Powerful stuff. The smell is quite pleasant too. It&#x27;s smooth with a moderate viscosity that makes a small amount spread well, and there&#x27;s a lot in the canister. Sudocrem is definitely a good addition to a home med kit/drug cabinet.</li>
    <li> Great product with mild smell. I use it for many skin irritations.</li>
    <li> What is in this?! I sliced my toe over July 4th weekend and the skin in almost healed. I started using this on Sunday morning and it&#x27;s Tuesday night!</li>
    <li> All around great product.  Goes on smoothly, only takes a small quantity, smells nice not medicinal and was very effective on my dogs rash.</li>
    <li> By suffering my clear skin fell into acne zone for several months, I saw this product is recommended by one of the beauty blog. I decided to give it a try since it&#x27;s natural and can even use on babies. After continuously used for about a week, I can see significant improvement of my skin. Be patient to use this product, results be seen on the very next day.</li>
    <li> this product certainly measures up to it&#x27;s claim to fame.  i use this on my hands, cuticles, feet, etc.  great for burns, sores, mosquito bites.  love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s literally like a magic potion for my face. I&#x27;ve been using it on my acne scars and have seen drastic differences in pigmentation. I use it every night and when I wake up I notice that my skin has cleared up more and more. Def recommend!</li>
    <li> In Europe, I used to use this cream as an adult, for any sort of sun burn. Amazon is the only place I can order it from in the USA. Highly recommend it for baby&#x27;s diaper rash and for sunburn for anyone. Heals very quickly, a hundred times better than any burn cream or aloe vera creams.</li>
    <li> yes moms I think it is magic, my 7 weeks daughter has a diaper rash when she was 9 days, I started with A&amp;D which cured her and returned back after few days, Nystatin as doctor prescribed, Desitin the blue one and finally desitin the purple which was the best but still the rash is disappearing and coming back with few days, we changed the diaper brand, the size,  changing diapers frequently every two hours and using water to clean her, we had slight improvement, both sister and sister in law advised me to use this cream and it is marvelous, no diaper rash anymore!&lt;br /&gt;I received it before the estimated delivery time....&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sudocrem.....</li>
    <li> This product really helped us when our daughter was getting really bad rashes. highly recommend this product. Works great and the rash is gone.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I grew up with Sudocrem, it works.&lt;br /&gt;Generations of British families have relied on it for cuts, burns, rashes and sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth a try and always a good thing to have around the house.</li>
    <li> We lived in the UK for a number of years and our first born used quite a bit of Sudocrem.  When our second came along and we were back Stateside, he had nasty eczema flare ups and diaper rash.  Sudocrem has the reputation of being the &#x27;cure all&#x27; in the UK and recommended by a number of pediatricians.  Even though our little one has prescribed cream for his eczema, this does great for patches of skin and great for diaper rash as well.  Too bad the jar is very small, we use this quite a lot!</li>
    <li> Very good cream Cleared up my husband rash!</li>
    <li> this product is a magic on babies diaper rash !!&lt;br /&gt;It is one if the amazing cream to treat diaper rash</li>
    <li> Discovered Sudocrem in Europe many years ago when in need of diaper cream . . . it&#x27;s the best product of its kind on the market!  Great for all skin needs, longer lasting and more &amp;#34;durable&amp;#34; than well known competitors.</li>
    <li> We used to use Sudocream for kids and we know its great. This one is no different - and there was no delay, or any issue with the shipment ! So well deserved - 5 stars !</li>
    <li> This helped make some breakouts and a burn disappear before a major trip. A must have for my beauty cabinet.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my Csection incision.&lt;br /&gt;It is over 5 years old, but gets extremely itchy and will sometimes produce a rash.&lt;br /&gt;I was struggling with a bad one for almost 2 weeks until this arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Cleared it up within 2 days and the itch was gone within 1.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it on my acne, but I may if I get a flair up to test out how well it works on acne.</li>
    <li> amazing product really helps heal cuts fast!</li>
    <li> The product works very well with my skin, I like the light scent of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for being professional.&lt;br /&gt; I prefer this product for anybody has skin problems.</li>
    <li> Product worked but leaves messy residue... hard to clean up afterwards also..other than that its an alright product... thanks again</li>
    <li> This product is great. Really helps with my eczema and my breakouts, and isn&#x27;t to greasy. I will be sure to buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I live for this stuff. I have turned so many people onto this. my gram had a rash on her face she went to the doctor about for over a year.. remembered using this stuff in Ireland, and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it went away in a week!! :) I use this for everything. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> A very generous amount of a good multi purpose cream to keep in your medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> My 20 mo old had terrible diaper rash and nothing here seemed to work.  A co-worker who is from England said she uses Sudocrem.  I found it on Amazon and bought some to try.  It works wonderful and my little ones bottom looks great!</li>
    <li> Still waiting to see if it works. I heard good reviews about the product and will give it time to see if it lives up to expectations</li>
    <li> Works great!!! Will buy it again. I used it in England and wanted to buy it here in the US.</li>
    <li> Great product! Really good for acnes</li>
    <li> Use it for anti acne on face, actually works!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Works well.</li>
    <li> This worked on my eczema the first few days of using it, but after a week my eczema came back with a vengeance, the itchiness got worse. I will not be using this anymore, what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My nappies (diapers) were changed in conjunction with it. Then - growing up, any cut or scrape was treated with it. As a teenager I treated my acne with it and now I use it to treat my own or my kids little scrapes or wounds. It&#x27;s like its a part of the family. Wonderful stuff - as any Irish person will tell you it is normally the first thing an Irish mammy will reach for at the slightest sign of a cut.</li>
    <li> great for a lot of things.  i would not leave home without it.  great for burns and every day scratches</li>
    <li> This is the best healing cream on the market for any type of skin abrasion.  It protects the skin from moisture while speeding up the healin process.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taken me quite a while to write a review but when I purchased another jar today, decided that it was about time, since my first purchase was back in 2011! This cream has helped me to deal with angular cheilitis. Five years ago I was having terrible trouble with trying to get rid of sores at the sides of my mouth that were not only painful but very unpleasant to look at. Tried many different &#x27;cures&#x27; and nothing helped. Finally I stumbled across a forum where someone recommended Sudocrem and I figured since I&#x27;d tried so many other treatments, might as well try another. Even though I didn&#x27;t think it would do any good, I was desperate. Within a few days the sores were gone and within a week I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was completely gone! For a few months I was very diligent about continuing to apply during the day and before bed but eventually I found there was no need. Every once in a while I can feel the tell tale symptoms and I immediately grab the Sudocrem and it prevents the cheilitis from getting out of control. Since I only need to use small amounts, the 125g jar expired before I was able to use all of it, so getting four years usage out of one jar is an amazing bargain. :D FYI, be sure to order the &#x27;Prime Member&#x27; jar if you&#x27;re getting the 125g, even if you&#x27;re not a Prime member because otherwise you&#x27;ll have to wait a few weeks to a month for delivery!</li>
    <li> Sudocream is zinc oxide if that&#x27;s what you need.  I thought it was supposed to be a silver particle cream.  I gave it two stars for showing in the contents that it is zinc oxide.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Baby acne disappeared almost immediately!</li>
    <li> Great for acne on the back!  Works well and soothing.</li>
    <li> a friend suggested this cream for my psoriasis. it&#x27;s working good and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel or a strong odor.</li>
    <li> this stuff is magical&lt;br /&gt;removes redness&lt;br /&gt;kills infection&lt;br /&gt;just use a very thin layer, though, not a lot</li>
    <li> A must have for babys and family injuries!</li>
    <li> I had a sever chemical burn.  The prescription cream worked well, however a heath care worker told me about Sudocrem, and I decided to give it a try.  I applied the cream lightly as directed. To my surprise, the Sudocrem Antiseptic Cream worked faster than the prescription, speeding up the healing of the chemical burn.  I would recommend this cream for rashes and chemical burns.  However, reaction to any medicated cream will vary from one individual to another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***PLEASE FOLLOW YOUR DOCTOR&#x27;S INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE TRYING OTHER PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maizie Lucille James&lt;br /&gt;August 18, 2014</li>
    <li> Tried it to help with my itching ear canal. It didn&#x60;t do anything to illuminate the problem. Went to my ENT to get a medicine to clear up my infection.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t sing enough praises for this! I tried every diaper rash cream on the market for my first baby. Nothing worked for the really bad rashes. My aunt lives in England, and she swore by this for her kids. I bought some online, and COULD NOT BELIEVE how quickly this cleared up the worst rashes. You can&#x27;t find this is stores, and I was pleased to be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> We tried a few different diaper rash creams and felt none of them really did very much. Even vaseline seems to work better. One of my wife&#x27;s friends raved about how well Sudocrem works, so we tried it. Best. diaper cream. Ever. Every time I apply it to a rash on our baby, the rash is no longer there at the next diaper change. Plus a little bit on the finger goes an extremely long way, so it&#x27;s lasted us much longer than we thought it would. Diaper creams are cheaper, but they disappear in a hurry (mainly b/c it doesn&#x27;t work so you keep using it on the same rashes).</li>
    <li> Thanks to everyone who provided feedback on this product.  I was at a loss in how to treat three significant bed sores for my Mom.  I tried everything for weeks; even contacting a local medical supply store for advice without any success.  Within a six hour period and two changes it was obvious this product was the key.  Within nine days all open skin has completely healed over and I continue to use it as a preventative solution.  I also recommended this to the memory care facility where my Mom resided for three years.  I highly recommend this product and now feel totally confident I can care for my Mom more effectively going forward.  If I could have rated this ten stars I would have!</li>
    <li> Is very good we been in emergency hospital for dipper rush many time without good result ...finally I bought this magic product wit couple days my daughter got heald quickly.thankd</li>
    <li> No clue why this works but it takes care of many odd skin ailments. Plus..made in Ireland.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything on the Market for my baby skin problems. This is the best product there is. As other reviewers have said, it clears pretty much anything with a single application. It is a must for every parent medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I tried this for acne redness, so I applied this after cleansing to wear overnight. I&#x27;m not sure if I used too much, but the next morning my skin was very oily. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll try it again, but it didn&#x27;t work for me this time.</li>
    <li> I have used this for diaper rash, diaper rash prevention, and around my daughters feeding tube site.  It worked great on all of the above. It prevents the area on her stomach from breaking down due to acidic stomach contents.  I have tried many different creams for my daughter but this worked the best.  I have also realized that what works for one child doesn&#x27;t always work for another.  My boys just need aquaphor (this too is an excellent product), but that wasn&#x27;t enough for my daughter.  Or when they are sick they may need something different due to the balance in the bowels changing.  Amazon has made this very easy to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I had a colonoscopy.  If you are familiar with the preparation process you will know how uncomfortable that can be.  So I tried Sudocrem on myself and found out first hand how great it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monimom</li>
    <li> A friend suggested I get this to use on my son&#x27;s diaper rash after other creams like A&amp;D and Cocoa Butter didn&#x27;t work. I got this stuff and it was AMAZING. After washing my son&#x27;s bum and applying a small amount, his diaper rash would be gone overnight. I also used it on my post-pregnancy acne and it would dry everything up in a matter of days. The great part is that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, so the container will last for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. I use it constantly and a tiny amount goes a long way. It works best with a thin layer rubbed in and works on scrapes, burns, blisters, etc. Anything that is irritated or hurting. I tried to find a dupe for it in the US but haven&#x27;t come close.</li>
    <li> This product really mad the itch go away!</li>
    <li> Everyone raves about this cream at my children&#x27;s school. So I made the purchase and waited one month for this to arrive. the cream is very thick almost like refrigerated butter. My son has excema and his skin is very sensitive. He would get diaper rashes very easily and I thought that this cream would work well for him. To each their own, this cream did not work well for him. I thought that because the cream was so thick that it would act as a barrier to keep the moisture from his skin. Unfortunately this formula doesn&#x27;t work with his skin well</li>
    <li> This cream is top of the line.  It works for cuts, scrapes, rashes but mainly for infants as the best diaper cream on the market. A mother should not go without this product.</li>
    <li> The best ever. Not too many other products can compare. This cream will ease a lot of frustration and stress for both the patient/family member and the caregiver.</li>
    <li> great product -- wish we could purchase in USA.</li>
    <li> so glad I found out about this stuff! My twins were both starting to get a rash. One of them did get prescribed an intifungal cream. It went away. Then my other baby started getting a redness on her bottom. Again my baby that had a rash first started to get redness. So, I ran a search on google (best diaper rash cream) and sudocrem popped up.....via amazon. Read the reviews and decided I needed this asap! We had tried butt paste as well as aveeno diaper rash cream. Those did NOTHING to help prevent nor cure the rash. After just a few applications they are both clear!! Love sudocrem!!  It really is amazing as others have commented. I will definitely recommend to anybody that is having a baby or anyone dealing with a rash.</li>
    <li> I wish I could rate this product higher.  I would give it a 5 if just basing it on how much I like the product and results.  It works as a great nightly moisturizer and smells wonderful.  But, I tend to opt for more natural ingredients than this product contains.  Sadly, for that reason I probably won&#x27;t order again.  If they ever change to more natural ingredients than count me a fan.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a rash, but unfortunately the rash got worse almost immediately.  So I am not using it.  I would say give it a try, as I have had reactions to a lot of other products, and you may not.</li>
    <li> This product works well on my son&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> My one year old has started to develop rashes at nearly every diaper change.  I have tried EVERYTHING under the sun, including making my own creams!  Nothing seemed to be working as well as they once had.  I ordered this cream about two weeks ago after searching the internet and seeing all these great reviews on Sudocrem.  Due to it being shipped from overseas it took a long time to get here.  Yesterday I was near making a doctor&#x27;s appointment for my son&#x27;s fire red rash when I noticed the little box on my doorstep and remembered I had ordered this cream.  Not expecting much of anything, I slathered his little rear end before dinner.  By bath time, which was only 2 hours later there had been a HUGE improvement.  I&#x27;m willing to say it was about 50% better!  This morning it&#x27;s not even the slightest bit red and I&#x27;m confident it will be gone by tomorrow!  I logged on today to order another tub, due to the shipping taking forever, I&#x27;m in fear to be without it!</li>
    <li> I am a preschool teacher from England and have changed a ridiculous amount of diapers over the past 11 years, in England and in the US. Since moving to the US I have not found a diaper cream as effective as sudocrem, and I have used many kinds. I am expecting a baby boy and I knew there is no better diaper rash cream than sudocrem and if I had to get family to ship it to me from the UK I would. I was so happy to find I could purchase it through amazon.    With sudocrem I have seen severe diaper rash go down to a very mild one by the end of the day and mild diaper rash disapear by the end of the day, by using just a small amount at each diaper change. The tub of cream lasts a long time, the expression \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot; is very relevant to this cream. With all the creams I have used in the US diaper rashes take days to disappear and the tubes of cream do not seem to last any where near as long as a tub of sudocrem. Sodocrem is well worth paying a few extra dollars for, it most likely ends up cheaper in the long run as it lasts so long.    -------------------------------------------------------------    UPDATE - I recently found this article I thought I should share    [...]    In case the link expires the key points are:    \\&quot;Sudocrem® is the British version of TRIPLE PASTE®. Same amazing cream for preventing diaper rash, only more bang for your buck...    1) Cost  In USA Tripple Paste costs at least $1.46 per 1 oz (see Amazon.com)  In USA Boudreaux Butt Paste costs at least $0.92 per 1 oz (see Amazon.com)  In USA A&amp;D zinc oxide costs at least $0.77 per 1 oz (see Amazon.com)  In the UK Sudocrem® costs at least $0.64 per 1 oz (see Amazon.co.uk)....    2) Concentration of the active ingredient zinc oxide  Triple paste contains 12.8% zinc oxide,  Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste contains 16% zinc oxide  A&amp;D zinc oxide contains 10% zinc oxide  Sudocrem® contains 15.25% zinc oxide....    Sudocrem is clinically proven to soothe, heal and protect your baby&#x27;s delicate skinand works in three ways:    * A water-repellent base forms a protective barrier, helping to stop any irritants (urine and feces) coming into contact with the skin.  * It both softens and soothes sore, inflamed skin.  * It has a weak local anaesthetic to help ease pain and irritation.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Earlier this year I developed eczema primarily on the left side of my torso which my doctor suspected was an allergic reaction to something. Never having anything similar happening or having anything new introduced into my lifestyle or environment, all we could do is treat the symptoms. By chance, I had a trip planned home to Europe to visit family where a friend recommended Sudocrem as she has been successfully using it to treat the diaper rash on her twin boys. She even gave me a small jar to bring back with me.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only thing that I found effective to soothe the itch and reduce the redness as well as preventing the clothing from irritating it again. I&#x27;m also very relieved to see that it is available to purchase on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I tried this for a rash on my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;All it did was burn and make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good deal. Exactly as described. Shipping a little slw. The product works miracles.</li>
    <li> This one is fantastic for oil skin. But in winter, it is too dry though.Anyway, I still use it once a week, apply it on my nose, the black head comes out!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. The best out there for kids skin rash!</li>
    <li> it lighten the underarms. I like it.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream. Years ago I got a really bad sunburn and there were no medical facilities available so I used this and it did a great job. All my nieces and nephews used this as their diaper cream and now my son does also. In my opinion this is the very best diaper cream on the market and even better still as it has other uses.</li>
    <li> This antiseptic healing cream is very potent and vey good for rash very dry skin and other sentitive skin concerns.</li>
    <li> this is poreclogging and slimey feeling, it doesnt absorb so dont expect it to. i dont really like it, maybe im using it wrong. i was trying it for pimples.</li>
    <li> IT WORK MIRACLES. I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS A FEW MONTHS OLD BECAUSE SHE HAD A DIAPER RASH AND NOTHING SEEM TO WORK. MY DAUGHTER IS 18 MONTHS AND I STILL HAVE THE BOTTLE LEFT. IT LAST A LONG TIME. THIS CREAM HELPS PREVENT DIAPER RASH AND IT ALSO HELP GET RID OF DIAPER RASH FAST AND YOU ONLY NEED TO USE A LITTLE BIT OF IT. WHEN I SEE A DIAPER RASH COMING I RUB JUST A LITTLE ON THE AREA AND IT&#x27;S GONE THE NEXT DAY. I USUALLY PUT IT ON HER WHEN I NEED TO. I DON&#x27;T MIND PAYING THE MONEY FOR IT BECAUSE IT&#x27;S THE BEST!</li>
    <li> I gave a low score on this product because of it&#x27;s too pasty white look it gives you, especially if you are using it for&lt;br /&gt;whatever reason on your face. makes you like a geisha. but it is great for diaper rash or other skin problems for it does stay in place.  Just dont use too much.</li>
    <li> I love to use this with my kids, it work fast with diaper rash, it is unbelievable.  I love it so much and I can not travel without this cream. Thank you so much for making a great product like this.</li>
    <li> it eases my brother&#x27;s eczema and it really helps him. We also used this stuff on my little girl when she was still in nappies and it worked great for her!</li>
    <li> Nice product help reduce and control a rash.</li>
    <li> The day I got it I washed my face and applied the cream as instructed and the next morning some of my acne has vanished I&#x27;m so happy with this product :)</li>
    <li> Finally Sudocrem in the USA which doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune!! :)</li>
    <li> Bought this after reading other Amazon reviews. Helped little ones rash clear up, can&#x27;t say it was faster than y other cream, but this one smells nice and I like that it is in a pot and not a tube. No fight to get the last bit out!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t clear up eczema as expected, wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> great cream for diaper rash and pimples</li>
    <li> I found this cream on u tube where a young women was going through her routine for covering and treating acne cysts. The cream just made sense to me on how it would help. I spend all this money on acne products on-line and off&lt;br /&gt;some of them expensive and then find this cream which is cheap and simple ingredients, and it has helped my daughters skin more than any other product. I have used Amazon so much and to think I could find this simple, cheap miracle cream is surprising to me.</li>
    <li> I used this cream for eczema blemishes and my teenage sons acne marks and it worked great. I would recommend it and it last a long time because it is very thick and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
    <li> quick delivery and does wonders for the eczema on elbows!  a cure for the long cold new england winter!  great price!  I am a believer!!</li>
    <li> really helped to clear up a persistent diaper rash on baby where nystatin (yeast cream prescribed by doc) did not.  When my kid had a bright red diaper rash, I wiped, bathed in oatmeal, air dried, then tried this cream - she screamed very loudly and cried a long time.  This meant another bath and some aquaphor instead.  long story short, it stings.  It helped some, but be weary on raw skin.</li>
    <li> I beleive sudocrem is a British product, i recently moved to the states an cannot find it anywhere... so heck ! order it off amazon ! :P great for everything from a sore butt after a sitting of exta hot chicken wings too exczema,nappy rashes, burns bruses an scrapes.</li>
    <li> This is the go to cream in the UK, it is amazing for diaper (nappy) rash,chill blains, bed sores,I&#x27;ve tried the US creams and they can&#x27;t touch Sudocrem for fast results, I order batches throughout the year, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works for anything. A miracle cream. Excellent with burns.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff for everything, it is truly a miracle cream. Heals diaper rash, soothes cuts and bug bites, and I even use it on blemishes and under my eyes for a night cream. So glad I could find it here in the US</li>
    <li> Has stopped bed sores from forming and has healed bruising really quickly from pressure of bed ridden patient.  Would highly recommend it for bed ridden patients and beginning bed sores.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my sister who raved about it forever, I never knew what the fuss was all about until I used it the first time when my son had a bad diaper rash.  The rash disappeared with ONE application!! And now that my son is no longer in diapers, I still use it on his skin if he has a bruise. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon, I had to have someone buy it for me from the UK. Thank you AMAZON for bringing us this magic potion to the US</li>
    <li> I have been using Amazon for over 5 years now and never wrote a review. Never was so compelled. I came to know of this cream form my friend who used this for his newborn&#x27;s eczema. My daughter had horrible rashes and we started using this and it helped heal faster, I think. I was not amazed by that but last night my nephew had bad eczema rashes on neck and chest and he was really suffering. We tried this and it completely healed in less than 24 hours. I was so impressed, I had to write a review.</li>
    <li> excellent, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I use this on my pimples or whenever my boyfriend has patchy dry skin because of the weather. He naturally has eczema so this really helps him. For the price, this is the cheapest you&#x27;d find online! I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> BEST BOOTY CREAM EVER!!</li>
    <li> My family has used this for years for everything from diaper rash, to burns/cuts, to insect bites. It works on so many things you won&#x27;t need a cupboard full of creams.&lt;br /&gt;My mum packed 5 big pots of this for me when I moved to the US. My wife bought a few other cremes for rashes &amp; she soon stopped. None of them compared with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I had a particularly nasty allergic reaction to mosquito bites when I got here &amp; I would swell uncontrollably. At one point, from a single bite, my forearm looked like Popeye&#x27;s. It was all red, like an infection. It was kind of scary. I applied a big blob of this to a sterile pad &amp; wrapped my arm with it. It took a while but it drew all the redness out &amp; the swelling went down. It even stopped the itching.&lt;br /&gt;I have had the same success with spider &amp; other bug bites. (There&#x27;s lots of bugs where I live ... really big ones).&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering this now because I gave my last pot to help with my grand-daughter&#x27;s rashes &amp; I have some more mosquito bites that need taking care of. I have tried everything &amp; nothing else works like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I have not idea what&#x27;s in it or why it&#x27;s so good. But it is.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take my word. Buy a small pot &amp; try it.</li>
    <li> Works  and it must for my wife says so and she has tried many others.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old son had very harsh eczma i put the cream on n his skin is clearing up</li>
    <li> this product works great, just as the company says it will. used it on my eight month old baby to clear up some diaper rash, worked great. the rash went away after just one use. would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great for sunscreen and sunburn. Not greasy !</li>
    <li> used to treat my acne issues and this stuff literally gets rid of the acne over night.</li>
    <li> great this is useful for me. because i need this thing long time, and it is great. really good thing</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing my 2 month old had severe eczema in her diaper area &amp; under her arms.... This cream cleared it up within 2 weeks with no more flare ups! Will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream! Fast acting long lasting and the fragrance is lovely!&lt;br /&gt;A UK top notch secret!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!!</li>
    <li> I used this product few months. But i do not think it works. I still have blackheads and make my skin even sensitive than before</li>
    <li> What this is good for is calming down skin irritations, so I like to use it when I have an inflamed breakout on my face. Over a few days it will take the redness down and dry out the breakout. It doesn&#x27;t work for blackheads, it&#x27;s really more for any pimple where inflammation and redness is an issue. It also doesn&#x27;t heal whiteheads, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re hoping for, this isn&#x27;t the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to take down the redness and irritation of waxing and if I have any razor burn after shaving. It relieves the stinging of razor burn right away and prevents the red bumps from appearing. It also helps prevent any ingrown hairs or irritated pores from waxing.</li>
    <li> I used this product, it did not work for me, therefore, I will not recommend anybody to buy it. It was a wast of my money.</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer pointed out. I don&#x27;t know how this works or why but it just does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our little one had mild-to-moderate diaper rash and this product works like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other diaper creams work by forming a moisture-proof barrier so that the body can cure the affected area naturally. This one is different. It actually cures the affected area in less than a day. Two days at the most. You can hear about it all you want but you won&#x27;t believe it until you actually see it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Let me pass along a tip that I got from someone who suggested this product to us in the first place - Don&#x27;t apply too much. Only apply a very thin layer - only on the affected area. And, only use it until you see the rash disappear and then, STOP. After that, use Vaseline petroleum jelly (and be liberal) to prevent future occurrences of diaper rash. Your baby&#x27;s bottom will be happy and so will you.</li>
    <li> I tried different kind of diaper rash creams for my son but nothing worked, then my friend from Europe recommended to try Sudocream. It works really well!</li>
    <li> this product is very effective, i use this as a mask for face. after one time use, my skin becomes soft, white and clean.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing and I highly recommend it.If you have rashes, breakouts or any minor skin irritations...works very well!</li>
    <li> This has worked fantastic on my 7 month old! We use it on her head for red spots (she wears a helmet to round out a flat spot on her head) and if course for diaper rash.</li>
    <li> Seems to be more effective than Aquaphor Baby Healing Ointment once there are signs of rash. Otherwise both work fine.</li>
    <li> This cream honestly is the best I&#x27;ve found. My daughter has severely sensitive skin and have had to use Triple Paste ever since she started teething (Also found super cheap on Amazon):)Once she hit a year and a half she had a horrible rash for over a month. Doc said just to keep doing what I was doing but she was miserable and the cream stopped working. I switched to this Sudocream based on ALL of the awesome reviews. IT IS AMAZING. I am back again now buying more. Stock up because you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This took a long time to come in but it seems to work okay.  I purchased it to replace the typical antiseptic cream at home because this cream does more than the many others I have tried.  It treats many skin irritations, minor cuts and burns.  Also a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> Great quality... Prompt shipping!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel anything special about this item, it&#x27;s kind of sticky and I don&#x27;t think I will purchase another one in the future.</li>
    <li> This product beats the pants off of all American diaper (nappy) creams I&#x27;ve tried. I am happy to have found a supplier!</li>
    <li> I got Sudocrem because it was recommended for break-outs, but soon found out it quickly heals all sorts of skin drama.  As for preventing break-outs, I did not find that it worked really well for that, but it does help heal the ones that appear.  If you want to use it all over your face at night I recommend putting on a layer of moisturizer first to help smooth it over your skin.  A little goes a long way unless you are actually trying to look like a geisha.</li>
    <li> Great scent, thick cream so a little goes a long way. It helped my 5 yrs old with her eczema, and as a diaper cream, it worked miracles when many other brand name creams failed us.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to Sudocrem but every Bulldog website recommends it for any of my bulldog&#x27;s skin conditions.  I use it on his chin acne and his nose fold.  All is well so far.  It is so reasonably priced compared with actual dog medication.</li>
    <li> Awesome on delivery and great for acne.</li>
    <li> it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it help me good&lt;br /&gt;i like it ,&lt;br /&gt;it look not bad.&lt;br /&gt;~~~ ~ ~ ~</li>
    <li> I chose this because I wanted a quality product that would help a skin issue without making it worse.  It seemed to work well for that, so well, in fact, that I gave some of it to family members for other skin irritations and it worked for them too.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it leaves a white residue on your skin so some people may not want to put it on when going out in public.  I like the fact that this does not contain harsh chemicals.  It seems like a little goes a long way and the size I purchased was perfect for my needs while allowing me to put some in a smaller container to share with family.</li>
    <li> OK but others are cheaper and work just as well.  I will not order it again but I am using it now.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best but shipping was very slow x</li>
    <li> We tried it because it was less expensive than the Welleda Calendula Diaper Rash Cream we were using. But it did not work as well. Went back to Welleda despite the cost. Baby&#x27;s butt is more important!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for the specified purposes. Works like magic.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be like Silver sulfadine cream used for pressure sores. I am not giving up on it. I am sure it is good cream just not for my daughters wounds.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very thick cream. It&#x27;s a great multi-functional cream but it doesn&#x27;t blend into the skin very nicely. It also smells nice and it&#x27;s pretty affordable. A little does go a long way. It&#x27;ll last a really long time as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from Dyshidrotic eczema for 2 years. Tried everything from steroid shots to Clobetasol only to have temporary effects which actually made if worse. It came back with a vengeance. My medicine cabinet is filled with every skin cream you could imagine, Neosporin lotion, even tried Neem supplements. Nothing. The soles of my feet and palms of my hand would hurt so bad from open peeling wounds that even the simplest chores would be so hard. I was frustrated as even doctors couldn&#x27;t give me an answer. Frustrated, I searched online, found reviews from Amazon about Calmoseptine ointment. It did make it better but it was just a bit messy and thick to constantly apply on my skin. It would get all over the floor and a pain to clean. Back to amazon I go and found Sudocrem. Easy to 2-3 a day. Suddenly, after a month of using it, my skin started to heal. Just today, 3/4 of the eczema is healed, which is what prompted me to spread the word to those people looking for a remedy. Once you apply it, the itching stops, and absolutely relieves the pain instantly. Amazing. I will not say that this cream is the sole reason my skin is better since I simultaneously changed my diet by adding fish oils, replacing dairy milk with almond milk, limiting sugar intake, biotin, and juicing once a day. Also used Grandpa soap pine tar. I also had to deal with stress through the power of positive thinking, and yes, PRAYER. But I know that this cream heals the skin FAST and relieves the itching. And would never be without it. I could understand the pain and depression Dyshidrotic eczema causes, and for something less than 10 bucks, it sure is worth a try.</li>
