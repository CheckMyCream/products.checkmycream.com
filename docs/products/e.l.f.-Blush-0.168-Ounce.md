### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Very awesome purchase for me.</li>
      <li>Great dupe for Nars Albatross!</li>
      <li>Awesome 😊</li>
      <li>this is not a dupe for Nars, it&#x27;s not the greatest quality and isn&#x27;t has glowy and dewey as the Nars highlighter</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Excellent.</li>
      <li>That said, it makes a beautiful highlighter (as it was no doubt intended).</li>
      <li>This product is beautiful and shimmery.</li>
      <li>so it was great for highlighting my cheekbones.</li>
      <li>I sometimes wear it on my eyelids to brighten them up and it looks great that way.</li>
      <li>However it looks great as an eyeshadow;</li>
      <li>Great highlight color.</li>
      <li>the price is good.  </li>
      <li>and then I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
      <li>Product is good</li>
      <li>I have fair skin</li>
      <li>But good alternative to NARS.</li>
      <li>Great multipurpose highlighter. :)</li>
      <li>Love it great dupe for albatross</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>If you compare to the Nars much better deal!  </li>
      <li>but this is an amazing gold/yellowish shade with flecks of gold in it.</li>
      <li>I have light olive skin and the gold color looks great.</li>
      <li>bought it from Amazing Innovation and had no problems from them.</li>
      <li>It is an amazing highlighter.</li>
      <li>It gives a nice gold glow but it is chalky.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t own the Nars but tested it in the store.</li>
      <li>Gives great shimmery effect and doesnt feel like to much and for a great price.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice addition to my collection and does what it is intended</li>
      <li>It is kind of \\&quot;loose\\&quot; and the brush picks it up very easily, but it also tends to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice bright color when applied lightly. :-)</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a good budget friendly substitute.</li>
      <li>another lovely product from e.l.f.</li>
      <li>This highlighter is fantastic!</li>
      <li>Just make sure to *dab*</li>
      <li>Better when matched with a more bronze hue.</li>
      <li>Much better than NARS.  </li>
      <li>It gives you a light but noticeable glow!</li>
      <li>The seller was on top of it.</li>
      <li>Love elf.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>to do ~ leave your face with a lovely glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product very noticeable needs to be well blended.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite inexpensive a blushes that I purchased.</li>
      <li>A must have! :)</li>
      <li>Although this color is used for a highlight or the touch which it could use for the bottom of eyebrows, eye shadow, etc., was beautiful, and was seen is visible to a white, gold is contained and elegant gloss comes out!</li>
      <li>This was well worth the purchase!!</li>
      <li>So if you order it to use as highlighter, don&#x27;t apply it generously like you might with bronzer or blush and it should work just fine.</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s more glittery, I think I might just wear it in a causal setting, maybe for a fun night out.</li>
      <li>Actually reaaally good.  </li>
      <li>This is a good illuminizer, as long as you use a light hand.  </li>
      <li>I have many illuminating products in pretty much every form.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>A little more shimmery than I would have liked.</li>
      <li>Chalky and does not really show good on the skin.</li>
      <li>She sent it to me right away</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a regular blush color but more like a finishing powder.  </li>
      <li>I will say have to play around with it more and maybe try it on different brushes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>My item was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I did really like this product.</li>
      <li>The box it came in was 20 times the size of it and their was bubble wrap but not enough to secure the blush.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I ordered the product to use as a highlighter and really like how it looks.</li>
      <li>Really about preference..</li>
      <li>This is definitely a very shimmery powder.  </li>
      <li>So I couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much money on a highlighter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and gets everywhere!</li>
      <li>enough so that I wear it a lot on its own without any other colors.</li>
      <li>just wanted a little more umph</li>
      <li>Normally I buy the Nars highlighter for 30 $ .</li>
      <li>I also have very sensitive acne prone skin</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a sheer color with a lot of shimmer to it which is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I use it on top of my blush and on my forehead, nose and chin for just a little something extra.  </li>
      <li>This is too sparkly and clearly visible on skin.</li>
      <li>On fast days, I use as a specific area highlighter.</li>
      <li>Fair warning, though, the first time I used it, it was very heavy, thick, and chalky.</li>
      <li>This was referred to me by several makeup blogs for a pale skin highlighter, but it has way too much gold shimmer!</li>
      <li>It is shimmery, not flat.</li>

<li> You have to be careful that you just don&#x27;t dig in with your brush on this product.</li>

    <li> Just a little goes a long way. Should last a long time. Gives you that dewy glow.</li>
    <li> Blush came completely broken I couldn&#x27;t salvage any of it. The box it came in was 20 times the size of it and their was bubble wrap but not enough to secure the blush. Such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Really about preference.. I use this as a highlighter and it works okay. I find it hard to create that dewy affect unless I wet my brush before applying. I prefer to use highlighters of a wetter consistency, like the one created by Urban Decay.</li>
    <li> Excellent. My item was exactly what I wanted. It was described correctly and arrived several days before it was supposed to 👍👍</li>
    <li> Very Long Island club scene.</li>
    <li> Although this color is used for a highlight or the touch which it could use for the bottom of eyebrows, eye shadow, etc., was beautiful, and was seen is visible to a white, gold is contained and elegant gloss comes out!</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s labeled as a blush, but I have no idea what skin tone you have to have to use this that way. That said, it makes a beautiful highlighter (as it was no doubt intended). I use it on my cheekbones, chin, forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day, so often that I&#x27;ve already hit pan and I&#x27;ve only had it a couple months. It is kind of \\&quot;loose\\&quot; and the brush picks it up very easily, but it also tends to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped it once and it didn&#x27;t crack or break at all.</li>
    <li> I like the highlighter for the price that your paying. It gives a nice gold glow but it is chalky.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Will order again</li>
    <li> this is not a dupe for Nars, it&#x27;s not the greatest quality and isn&#x27;t has glowy and dewey as the Nars highlighter</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit to glittery for what I was wanting and the fallout is horrendous but I will say now that I have a slight tan, I feel that it is not too bad. Because it&#x27;s more glittery, I think I might just wear it in a causal setting, maybe for a fun night out. I will say have to play around with it more and maybe try it on different brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it from Amazing Innovation and had no problems from them.</li>
    <li> I thought I try a cheaper version this time . Normally I buy the Nars highlighter for 30 $ . It&#x27;s a lot of money . So this one is affordable and I think it&#x27;s the same ..... Awesome 😊</li>
    <li> One of my favorite inexpensive a blushes that I purchased. Comparing to &amp;#34;nars&amp;#34; quality... And I know my makeup. A must have! :)</li>
    <li> This product is beautiful and shimmery. I use it under my brows, on the insides of my eyes, and mix it with my blush.  Great multipurpose highlighter. :)</li>
    <li> I got this instead of getting the more expensive Nars one. This is too sparkly and clearly visible on skin. It doesnt blend well. I was hoping to use it for contouring, but don&#x27;t think I will end up using it.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is definitely a very shimmery powder.  It&#x27;s not a regular blush color but more like a finishing powder.  It&#x27;s a sheer color with a lot of shimmer to it which is exactly what I was looking for.  I use it on top of my blush and on my forehead, nose and chin for just a little something extra.  Just be careful not to over do it or it&#x27;ll just make your face look extremely oily.</li>
    <li> This product is to glittery and settles into skin (not in a flattering way). Chalky and does not really show good on the skin. You can maybe use as an eyeshadow or to brighten up the inner corner of the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Beige to tan skin tone</li>
    <li> This product does the job for the price. I have not purchased nars albatross so I&#x27;ll have to do that in order to do a comparision</li>
    <li> Great highlight color. It&#x27;s suppose to be a dupe for NARS Albatross. I don&#x27;t have Albatross but this is an amazing gold/yellowish shade with flecks of gold in it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product to use as a highlighter and really like how it looks. Fair warning, though, the first time I used it, it was very heavy, thick, and chalky. So if you order it to use as highlighter, don&#x27;t apply it generously like you might with bronzer or blush and it should work just fine. It&#x27;s a nice bright color when applied lightly. :-)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Great product! It gives you a light but noticeable glow!</li>
    <li> The color is very similar but the texture is not the same. You have to be careful that you just don&#x27;t dig in with your brush on this product. It&#x27;s very soft and gets everywhere! But it&#x27;s a good budget friendly substitute. I don&#x27;t often use highlighter. So I couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much money on a highlighter.</li>
    <li> I purchased the &amp;#34;gotta glow&amp;#34; color. It is an amazing highlighter. It is shimmery, not flat. I sometimes apply all over my face with a khabuki brush. On fast days, I use as a specific area highlighter. I also use it as an eye shadow when I&#x27;m in a hurry. This was well worth the purchase!! You r skin will glow. WILL BUY AGAIN!</li>
    <li> The product itself is terrific: however, every time I have purchased this it has come as cracked and the powder was all crumbled. Irritating.</li>
    <li> I did really like this product. I have fair skin so it was great for highlighting my cheekbones. Love elf.</li>
    <li> Great product! I only have to use a little amount and then I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;will defiantly be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> Actually reaaally good.  Gives great shimmery effect and doesnt feel like to much and for a great price.  Much better than NARS.  Totally recommended.</li>
    <li> Just make sure to *dab* this stuff on a small angular brush and use to highlight.  I actually tap off excess before applying. This is a good illuminizer, as long as you use a light hand.  Otherwise, heavy-handed, it will look cakey!  I like it and the price is good.  No break-outs, either.</li>
    <li> This highlighter is fantastic! I have light olive skin and the gold color looks great. Very awesome purchase for me. I also have very sensitive acne prone skin and I had no breakouts whatsoever from this product.</li>
    <li> a bit chalky and too glittery for my taste. I sometimes wear it on my eyelids to brighten them up and it looks great that way.</li>
    <li> Love it great dupe for albatross</li>
    <li> Product arrived broken</li>
    <li> Product is good just wanted a little more umph I guess. But good alternative to NARS. The seller was on top of it. She sent it to me right away I got the product prior to the anticipated date of arrival.</li>
    <li> Great product very noticeable needs to be well blended. I love it! Would buy again. Use it all the time now.</li>
    <li> This was referred to me by several makeup blogs for a pale skin highlighter, but it has way too much gold shimmer! Definitely not good for pale porcelain skin. Better when matched with a more bronze hue.</li>
    <li> If you compare to the Nars much better deal!  And don&#x27;t see a big difference.  I don&#x27;t own the Nars but tested it in the store.</li>
    <li> Great dupe for Nars Albatross!</li>
    <li> I have many illuminating products in pretty much every form.  This is a nice addition to my collection and does what it is intended to do ~ leave your face with a lovely glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet another lovely product from e.l.f.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a highlighter but it&#x27;s way to shimmery to work as that. However it looks great as an eyeshadow; enough so that I wear it a lot on its own without any other colors. I&#x27;ve never seen this color in the store.</li>
    <li> Highlight with no shimmer. I really like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. A little more shimmery than I would have liked.</li>
</ol>
