      <li>Great product so far.  </li>
      <li>Seems like might be great if you have a single preferred oil, but in our case we like many.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean out.</li>
      <li>Great color changing lights with different settings.</li>
      <li>The kids were thrilled by the gentle mist &amp; changing colors.</li>

      <li>We would do what was recommended to clean this unit, but with no luck.</li>
      <li>With a full fill it runs for 4 hours, smells great and turns itself off when empty.</li>
      <li>Reasonable price &amp; easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough of how thrilled I am with it.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price though, I think.</li>
      <li>Great for a small room</li>
      <li>It has very modern design</li>
      <li>I actually like it better than my YL diffuser for durability.</li>
      <li>I love my essential oils.  </li>
      <li>It works exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I love using this in my daughter&#x27;s loft to diffuse essential oils instead of chemically-infused air fresheners.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what I purchased it for.</li>
      <li>It has a soft light that changes colors, and 3 settings.  </li>
      <li>Needless to say he was very happy</li>
      <li>It is very compacted and yes it looks cool especially with the changing light colors</li>
      <li>Remember the top part turns different colors, which is very soothing.  </li>
      <li>I feel good about picking this over a more expensive model.</li>
      <li>Firstly, I was surprised as to how quickly this package arrived to my door.</li>
      <li>It is easy to operate, got some nice colors and has a decent quality feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a rather large loft, so I probably need several units to cover the entire place with aroma.</li>
      <li>If you are going to use this for your bedroom or a smaller room, it is perfect, however, if you are planning to buy this unit for a large living room with high ceiling, you will have to run it a minimum of 8-10 hours a day or you would hardly notice it.</li>
      <li>very good.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
      <li>Does not hold much water</li>
      <li>I really like the color changing...very mellow.</li>
      <li>Bought my daughter and granddaughter one, and they are really liking them as well.</li>
      <li>I used to own another, more expensive unit sold by Young Living and much prefer this one.</li>
      <li>Pretty lights, or shut them off, very quiet, gives just the right amount of moisture to the air for sleep.  </li>
      <li>The item changes color, which is a nice feature, but very little aroma is diffused.</li>
      <li>Like the wide easy access opening .</li>
      <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t spend the extra money on the white one.</li>
      <li>I used high quality oil and cannot smell it at all.</li>
      <li>Maybe I just had high expectations....</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this diffuser...</li>
      <li>gave the product 4 stars because I would have liked the water reservoir to be a little larger, so that the unit would stay on longer.</li>
      <li>and when I add essential oil, it is absolutely devine!</li>
      <li>Other times the oil would just dissipate so fast it wasn&#x27;t worth using.</li>
      <li>but it last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
      <li>We have gone through quite a few different diffusers (which aren&#x27;t cheap!).</li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d gotten two green because the white cost more and</li>
      <li>He loves the changing color light and the fact that it looks like a &amp;#34;smoking volcano.&amp;#34;  The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is I paid a few dollars extra to get this in green (his favorite color) but we received a white one.</li>
      <li>The next night I tried and it broke completely!  </li>
      <li>The other problem is that the aroma is definitely much stronger when you turn the unit on.</li>
      <li>Literally, it was delivered in 11 hours from the time of the order (and I am not exaggerating).&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser itself is small, but very pretty to look at.</li>
      <li>Nice aromatherapy machine, a little expensive but works very well.</li>
      <li>little diffuser really puts out a lot of mist, and is so quiet.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does not work! I used high quality oil and cannot smell it at all. They also sent me the wrong color then I find out there is NO RETURN POLICY. Beware beware.</li>
    <li> I love this Diffuser it is the best for the price worth every sent and more.</li>
    <li> Excellent choice for a diffuser, works great and the color changing nightlight is a huge plus!  recommended for sure!  thank you!</li>
    <li> I believe the item is over priced at $50.00.  It does exactly what it is suppose to do, however when I opened the box and saw the size of the unit I must admit I was a little shocked.  It is very compacted and yes it looks cool especially with the changing light colors but if i had to do it over again - i probably would have to think twice about spending $50.00 something for this plastic devise.  Also it does start misting as soon as you push the start button and will shut off automatically when there is no more water or oil in it.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 2 months. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Does what  it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Happy I bought it.  Remember the top part turns different colors, which is very soothing.  Glad I didn&#x27;t spend the extra money on the white one.</li>
    <li> Great for a small room</li>
    <li> We got this diffuser for my son&#x27;s room.  We use it nightly and it works great! He loves the changing color light and the fact that it looks like a &amp;#34;smoking volcano.&amp;#34;  The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is I paid a few dollars extra to get this in green (his favorite color) but we received a white one.</li>
    <li> ZAQ Noor LiteMist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser (White)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received this 3 days ago, and set it up in less than 15 minutes. Very easy to use. I wanted it for my dog (a 70 lb Weimaraner) who sleeps on my bed. She has allergic rhinitis, and has been having a problem with a stuffy nose at night. I am using a \\&quot;Breathe Easy\\&quot; essential oil blend, and also Eucalyptis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little diffuser really puts out a lot of mist, and is so quiet. Ginger breathes much better now, and sleeps better with the scent. I also find that I&#x27;m breathing easier, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gave the product 4 stars because I would have liked the water reservoir to be a little larger, so that the unit would stay on longer. But, this diffuser seems like a keeper to me.</li>
    <li> Great product so far! The best part about it is that the device turns off when it gets low on water. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy to set up, easy and a joy to use.  I used to own another, more expensive unit sold by Young Living and much prefer this one.</li>
    <li> At first we loved this diffuser. It was perfect in size. The kids were thrilled by the gentle mist &amp; changing colors. It was not overpowering. Unfortunately before long we realized it was difficult to change oils. We would do what was recommended to clean this unit, but with no luck. Each time we would add a new scent, it would end up smelling awful with all the previous retention. Other times the oil would just dissipate so fast it wasn&#x27;t worth using. Seems like might be great if you have a single preferred oil, but in our case we like many. Ended up returning it for a refund &amp; hoping to find a different one without this issue.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use. My son likes that he can choose a color to keep it on or leave it to change colors.</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser! Great color changing lights with different settings. Works wonderfully. Like the wide easy access opening . Will probably get another one!</li>
    <li> this was ok when it worked, had it for about a month and it stopped working , wish I would have just spent the extra  money and ordered the young living one</li>
    <li> I researched quite a few diffusers and decided on this one based on price and reviews. I needed one that was electric because I have cats and don&#x27;t want candles burning where a tail can catch fire. It works exactly as described. With a full fill it runs for 4 hours, smells great and turns itself off when empty. At some point I want to get another one for my second floor! Highly recommend this diffuser...</li>
    <li> My husband has pneumonia and has been thru two rounds of meds.  So trying a lung treatment with essential oils and this diffuser works wonderfully.  Love it want another one....... having to move it around in the house.  Can&#x27;t say enough of how thrilled I am with it.  Great price too.  Elaine in TEXAS!</li>
    <li> I love using this in my daughter&#x27;s loft to diffuse essential oils instead of chemically-infused air fresheners.  It has a soft light that changes colors, and 3 settings.  Reasonable price &amp; easy to use.  Wish it had an intermittent setting, instead of just continual.  It only lasts about 4 hours.</li>
    <li> Nice aromatherapy machine, a little expensive but works very well. The changing lights is a nice addition. Not a terrible thing but wish it also gave me the option to use batteries.</li>
    <li> i bought this diffuser because of all the great reviews i read on amazon. i honestly did not know what to expect, never having owned a diffuser before.well i must say if its purpose is to disperse whatever fragance or essential oil smell thru out a room this does not accomplish that purpose. i followed what little instructions it came with and still no smell, not even in a small room.</li>
    <li> but it does also turn off by itself..very good.&lt;br /&gt;Nice aroma wished it were a little stronger though. I really like the color changing...very mellow.</li>
    <li> We have gone through quite a few different diffusers (which aren&#x27;t cheap!). We were using our Young Living diffuser but couldn&#x27;t afford to buy enough of those to go in other rooms of the house so after a TON of research and a few lousy diffuser tries I decided to order this one. Both my husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this diffuser. It does it&#x27;s job for therapeutic oils and works nicely. I actually like it better than my YL diffuser for durability.</li>
    <li> This is marvelous!  Pretty lights, or shut them off, very quiet, gives just the right amount of moisture to the air for sleep.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> It worked ONE time.  The next time the button was stuck, so my husband used a screw driver to push the button.  The next night I tried and it broke completely!  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. I own two of them: one at home, and one in the office. It&#x27;s easy to use and clean out.</li>
    <li> Two drops of oil in this and my whole room smells great in just a couple hours. It&#x27;s nifty. I feel good about picking this over a more expensive model.</li>
    <li> I use this daily. It starts immediately, is virtually noiseless, and looks cute. However, I wish it scented a larger area. Maybe it&#x27;s the oils I&#x27;m using. I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands..will keep experimenting. Definitely worth the price though, I think.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what I purchased it for. Diffuses oil mist efficiently into the air. Does not hold much water but it last a reasonable amount of time. I would purchase this product again and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Ordered green and received white. Was charged the price for green though.</li>
    <li> It broke after less than a week. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Firstly, I was surprised as to how quickly this package arrived to my door. Literally, it was delivered in 11 hours from the time of the order (and I am not exaggerating).&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser itself is small, but very pretty to look at. It is easy to operate, got some nice colors and has a decent quality feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a rather large loft, so I probably need several units to cover the entire place with aroma. That is exactly where this unit falls short of the expectations, since, due to its small volume, it requires several re-fillings throughout the day to make the aroma noticeable. The other problem is that the aroma is definitely much stronger when you turn the unit on. The longer you have it running, the less aroma will be dispersed. If you are going to use this for your bedroom or a smaller room, it is perfect, however, if you are planning to buy this unit for a large living room with high ceiling, you will have to run it a minimum of 8-10 hours a day or you would hardly notice it.</li>
    <li> Works great - only problem it only goes about 3 1/2 to 4 hours.  Does shut itself off.  Great product so far.  Bought my daughter and granddaughter one, and they are really liking them as well.</li>
    <li> I love my essential oils.  This diffuser works well to disperse the oils.  The only drawback is the resevoir is small.</li>
    <li> Came on time, I bought for my dad and he loved it...he was in shock when he opened gift and saw it. Needless to say he was very happy so I am to...he took it home and used it that day and said works good</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited about this oil diffuser, but unfortunately it does little to actually provide any aromatherapy. The item changes color, which is a nice feature, but very little aroma is diffused. I tried a couple of different oils to see if the lack of aroma could be specific to the type of oil used, but it was to no avail. I would not recommend this product. Maybe I just had high expectations....</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed. I used this 2 and it doesn&#x27;t work now and can&#x27;t even contact the seller!!</li>
    <li> This diffuser has been used in my daughters room for over a year now and works great! Small, but works in any bedroom and the nightlight is wonderful for kids!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product!. It has very modern design and when I add essential oil, it is absolutely devine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several diffusers. This one is far and away the best. It diffuses the scents better than any I&#x27;ve seen, and I love the light and color changes it has also. I tried it out for my Mom today, and she loved it so much that demanded it for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I got one in green and one in white...I wish I&#x27;d gotten two green because the white cost more and that&#x27;s just silly. A lot more.</li>
