      <li>The Tresemme 7 Day Keratn Smooth Heat Treatment is a great product.</li>
      <li>, this is an amazing product for the price.</li>
      <li>It has a mind of its own.  </li>
      <li>Used for about 4- 5 weeks, worked great nice and smooth, BUT after 4 weeks of use on my daughters hair</li>
      <li>It was against my better judgement, but I figured I had to in order to write a fair review.  </li>
      <li>conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so rarely impressed by beauty products and really didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this</li>
      <li>Having battled frizzy hair for years, I was thrilled to find keratin treatments.</li>
      <li>I also use my own shampoo/conditioner (not Tresemme)</li>
      <li>I was really impressed with what this product was capable of.</li>
      <li>It has a nice fragrance that dissipates</li>
      <li>This keratin treatment does work but it takes a period of adjustment to master the technique and figure the amount needed to work effectively.</li>
      <li>I really liked the results.</li>
      <li>Incredible at the first 5 days using it....</li>
      <li>I also do not care for the very strong scent.</li>
      <li>Soft, silky, shiny and smells great!</li>
      <li>It gave my hair a nice healthy feel</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impressed so far,</li>
      <li>my hair feels much better, doesn&#x27;t look greasy &amp; has a nice shine.</li>
      <li>it more hangs than flows nicely if that makes sense.</li>
      <li>This is a good cheap hair straightening gloss, but don&#x27;t expect the product of your dreams.</li>
      <li>But I must say i was pretty impressed with how well this did manage to smooth my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine</li>
      <li>so it was a pleasant surprise to have super shiny hair.</li>
      <li>It seems to need the extended hair contact of the flat iron to perform best, though I liked the result with the curling iron.  </li>
      <li>The cream has a light pleasant fragrance and pumps out smoothly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find something that works better than argan oil on my hair.</li>
      <li>I love the way my hair feels.</li>
      <li>I will always use this LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>like this better than the Keratin Smoothing Cream that you apply with each time...</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try.</li>
      <li>has really helped to keep my hair looking great.</li>
      <li>I am in love with the results and will repurchase.</li>
      <li>i love this thing..</li>
      <li>I am beyond satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give it more stars IF it reduce frizz better,sadly it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Also, I rather enjoyed the fragrance - it smelled like bananas.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with using the Keratin 7 Day Heat Activated Treatment on and off for a month and can report that my hair is much, much better with the product than without.  </li>
      <li>so i plan to wait a bit to see if i can get a better result.</li>
      <li>Safe to use on color treated hair, does not strip hair of color.</li>
      <li>I have tried different amounts of product to see what works best.</li>
      <li>seems ok but probably a crock just like all hair products</li>
      <li>- the product like many shampoos, hair conditioners, hair gels and skin care products contains DMDM hydantoin, an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative belonging to a class of compounds known as hydantoin and acts as a preservative because of the released formaldehyde.</li>
      <li>and I love that.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair better</li>
      <li>I would say that the scent lingers throughout the day, but again smells better than burnt hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received this as a gift. I have average thick, wavy hair. It gets frizzy and unmanageable when it&#x27;s hot or humid and lately I&#x27;ve been wearing it up too much.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the recommended shampoo and conditioner. I don&#x27;t use anything but Wen on my hair, so I used that and then applied a small amount of keratin to six sections of hair, then blew my hair dry with a large round brush as usual. Even before flat ironing, I could tell how smooth and shiny my hair was. But I did flat iron and it wow! I look like I just left the salon! My hair is gorgeous - very shiny and it feels like silk. My hair has NEVER felt this way even after deep conditioning treatments. It also looks like it grew an inch. I have never had a salon keratin treatment and with results like this, I don&#x27;t plan to.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is an average hair product smell. The texture is not sticky, kind of feels like a thin conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so rarely impressed by beauty products and really didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this but I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try. It is definitely going to become a staple in my beauty arsenal!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Really helps to leave my hair straight with softness and a shine.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy wavy hair. I thought I would try out Tresemme&#x27;s 7 day smooth hair products. I washed my hair with Tresemme&#x27;s 7 day smooth shampoo and conditioned it with 7 day smooth conditioner. I applied two pumps of Tresemme&#x27;s heat activated cream. I combed it through mine hair and proceeded to dry it with the blow dryer. I usually air dry but the directions state to blow dry. I then proceeded to use the flat iron 3 times on each section of hair. I made my hair very silky looking and greasy feeling. Also, I ended up having quite a bit of static electricity in my hair and everytime I put my coat on my hair stuck to it. I am displeased with this product and will not continue to use it.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorite hair products for about 6months.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it keeps my hair straight for days but it has a great consistency that works wonderful with my hair.  It&#x27;s not a thick liquid and it just absorbs nicely into my dry hair and if there is a day I don&#x27;t use it, I can tell my hair just doesn&#x27;t cooperate as well.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my hair manageable, smooth and bouncy.</li>
    <li> I used it exactly as the instructions said except that I do not blow my hair dry I just let it dry but I do flat iron it once it is dry  and although I did not think it made my hair greasy like others had said it did not work after shampooing like it claims to.  For me I did not notice any greasiness to it at all it was more of a stiffness and not even much of that but since it did not really work after shampooing I really can not see the benefit of using it  that was my whole purpose of buying it.</li>
    <li> I used this both when I blow out and flat iron and when I let my curls air dry.  I cannot have my curly hair ever look as good as when I apply this and let it air dry.  I literally have ringlets that are smooth and much less frizzy.  So I have to have this product no matter what.  There is nothing else that works for me.  I am having about 10 - 12 inches cut off in 2 days and will be wearing a shorter bob.  I know this will help me greatly.</li>
    <li> I used the entire Keratin Smooth line for about a month before I realized that it was doing major damage to my hair!! My hair was falling out by the HANDFUL in the shower. I later noticed that I had chunks of my hair that was broken off in random sections all over my head. My hair volume decreased by over 50%. The broken pieces are terribly damaged and feel like straw. I will NEVER use anything sold by this company ever again. I went to my dr to make sure there was nothing wrong with me, but after reading similar reviews on other sites I place the blame 100% on the Tresemme products.</li>
    <li> The TRESemme Expert Selection Treatment, 7 Day..Tresemme  started OK.  But, after a few days my hair became fuzzy . I looked like cotton candy.  I have graying hair and I would have to use more 7 Day treatment.  This would make my hair greasy.  So I would have to shampoo every other day for my hair to look OK.  I don&#x27;t want to flat iron my hair to make it look good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using the shampoo and conditioner until I can find a product that works for my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter has long, relatively straight hair that she likes to use a flat iron with.  However, she does get flyaway/static issues and split end issues.  This product worked to control both issues and has a pleasant smell.  In fact, her hair has never (except upon leaving the salon) felt as soft and smooth as when she&#x27;s used this item.  Definitely recommended if you are a flat iron user.</li>
    <li> I use this both with a hair dryer and a flat iron.  It works as advertised and helps keep my hair straight and not frizzy.  It also worked through several shampoos, as advertised. In all, I am pleased with this and will buy again when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I had to write to TRESemme&#x27; to see if this product contains formaldehyde, which they couldn&#x27;t answer!  I had to then write to uniliver.com, who manufacturers the product and found out it does contain formaldehyde.  I liked the way it made my hair very smooth, I have long hair and it was beautiful; however, once I found out that it contains formaldehyde, I won&#x27;t use it again..dangerous to your health and hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also found out TRESemme&#x27; tests on animals..will not use again.</li>
    <li> I have difficult Mediterranean hair, and that is an understatement. Despite washing it at most twice a week, pampering it with oils and deep conditioners, never dyeing and very rarely heat styling it, my hair is bone-dry, filled with split ends, and so brittle it&#x27;ll snap even if you just look at it the wrong way. After over a decade of tears and searching in vain for the miracle product that could solve my hair woes, I had resigned myself to a life of bad hair, except for the rare splurge on $300+ Brazilian blowouts at the salon when I could afford them. Until I tried this product. Being a hair product junkie, it caught my attention on Amazon so I decided to give it a try. I can honestly say this was one of the best decisions of my life. I admit that I was skeptical as I read the reviews, but I figured the condition of my hair probably couldn&#x27;t get any worse. After washing and conditioning with my regular products, I generously slathered it on my hair and began to blowdry. As others have mentioned, my hair dried much faster than usual, which was a plus considering my hair is rather long. Also, I rather enjoyed the fragrance - it smelled like bananas. Once my hair was dry, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference compared to my usual hair, but I plugged in my straightener on maximum heat (450 F) and got to work. I didn&#x27;t use a heat protectant because I had read on the box or pamphlet that it already has a heat protectant in it. With the first pass of the straightener over my hair, my coarse, brittle hair had transformed into a sleek, shiny, lock. By the time I had finished my entire head of hair, I was amazed. Was the end result as good as a professionally-done Brazilian blowout? No, but it was pretty darn close. My ends were still a bit dry, but overall, the condition of my hair had undoubtedly and majorly improved. I finished it off with a spritz of argan oil and my hair looked and felt amazing - shiny, reflective, and soft. I couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it (which I normally can&#x27;t since it tangles so easily). The next day at work, I had people asking me if I had gotten my hair done. Even my boyfriend (who knows my hair is a sore subject with me), complimented my new locks. Sadly though, after washing, my hair had partially reverted back to its usual, bone-dry state. My guess is because I hadn&#x27;t bought the accompanying shampoo and conditioner that&#x27;s part of the set. But I will now. If your hair is like mine (I&#x27;m not alone, right?), this is an amazing product for the price. My only wish was that there was more in the bottle, but it&#x27;s so inexpensive compared to other treatments out there that didn&#x27;t even work half as well on my hair, I don&#x27;t mind at all. I am definitely planning on buying in bulk and hoarding this stuff, so get it while you can! Sorry, (name of stylist), it was nice knowing you!</li>
    <li> I have thin, dry hair with some fly-aways especially during the winter. I hoped this product would smooth it out, but I saw no difference in texture while using this product.</li>
    <li> Great packaging, arrive on time. Surely love this product, love the smell the texture..its not sticky and keeps my hair so soft and smooth. works amazingly... my hair is very frizzy. And using this keeps it straight and in place.</li>
    <li> I normally wear my shoulder length angled bob wavy and deconstructed using sea salt spray, but I use this Tresemme product when I want to have a more polished, straight style. After blow drying my naturally straight hair, it looks really frizzy so I use this before drying it to tame the frizzies and to protect my hair from the heat elements. I then use a flat iron and my hair looks sleek and shiny. I wash my hair every other day and using this treatment has really helped to keep my hair looking great. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a decent hair treatment. It left my hair a little smoother and shinier when I flatironed it than it would otherwise look. It gave my hair a nice healthy feel and it looked nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this isn&#x27;t going to give you keratin type results. Mine lasted the day but was already fuzzy by night. There is no way it would make it a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fine styling cream. It just isn&#x27;t going to do what it says it does.</li>
    <li> I have only used really expensive shampoo and conditioner (Kerastase) in the past year, as I am trying to grow my fine ,fragile hair .I saw all of the great reviews for this Tresemme line so I went to Walgreens and got the big bottle shampoo and conditioner and the Treatment...for $15! So I followed the instructions to the letter and my hair has never looked or felt this great before! The thing I really like is that it seals all of my &#x27;snarly&#x27; ends!I can run my fingers through my hair and it doesn&#x27;t snag. This is wonderful stuff!</li>
    <li> I have thick type 4 hair that I wear natural and I am always skeptical of claims of this hair smoother or that hair smoother.  But I must say i was pretty impressed with how well this did manage to smooth my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a thick, silky cream that has a very nice light scent.  Beware, a little goes a long way.  It is very emollient.  I don&#x27;t normally blowdry or flat iron my hair.  Only when i want to effect a more &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; or sleek appearance.  When I have in the past, it was for a very short period of time as my hair very quickly likes to revert back to it&#x27;s natural curl.  However, the results when I used this were quite noticeable and the smoothing effect lasts noticeably longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product.  Enough so that i may actually purchase the shampoo and conditioner that goes along with this to see if their inclusion in my regimen has an even better effect on this product.</li>
    <li> Helps smooth unruly hair. I love it can go a week with out flat ironing. Smells good not chemically. Must have for the frizzy people out there.</li>
    <li> First, my hair: It is long, curly and super-thick.  When the humidity is low, I can style it smooth and it shines like glass.  When the humidity is high, I look like an 80&#x27;s hair band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this as directed, even though it said to use A LOT of product.  It was against my better judgement, but I figured I had to in order to write a fair review.  I dried my hair, then started the labor-intensive process of flat ironing tiny sections.  As I said, I have a ton of hair, so this took forever.  When I was done, I had straight greasy hair.  I couldn&#x27;t stand it, so I had to wash it immediately.  All that time wasted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the next few shampoos my hair did seem to stay a tiny bit sleeker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this again the following week, using what I felt was an appropriate amount of product.  The results were pretty good until I stepped out into the humidity.  Sigh.  My hair morphed into the same huge ball of frizz that it always does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 3 stars because I feel it would work better on someone with a different hair type.</li>
    <li> I picked up this product at my local Wegmans today and came home and washed my hair with my normal shampoo/conditioner. I followed the directions and my hair is so shiny and nice! My hair is just always dull so it was a pleasant surprise to have super shiny hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well.  A little spendier than I would like, but overall it&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> I will always use this LOVE this product. It does exactly what it says, it keeps your hair smooth for 7 days or more actually. I will be using this always!! I have never worn my hair straight, I got straight hair extensions, and they blend right in with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used the product as instructed several times, sectioning off my hair and combing it through. I have tried different amounts of product to see what works best. I have a really great professional flat iron. But this product does not work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, fine, curly hair. With a good blowout, a drop of Argan oil, and a little bit of flat iron, my hair will stay smooth and sleek for 3-4 days. However, if it gets damp then all bets are off.  Humidity makes it get all fluffy and if it gets wet, the curl comes back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth did nothing to change that. My hair looked great for a couple of days, but the minute it got wet, the curls came back. It did not last through ONE shampoo. It did not last through one rainy day. I also do not care for the very strong scent.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, and it&#x27;s beginning to thin a bit as I pass into my middle years.  A few weeks ago I had my hair colored, and the hairdresser left the chemical on my hair a bit too long, resulting in my hair being dry and brittle now.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different products to try and make the damaged hair look better, until it grows out enough to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions on the bottle, except I used 1 pump of product per hair section, rather than the 2 pumps per section that the directions indicate.  I followed up by blow drying, and then used a flat iron as directed.  Unfortunately, my hair ended up looking greasy and limp, although it did feel much softer even after I washed it a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the low price of this product, I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try for those people who have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair.  Unfortunately, with my hair type, many hair products just don&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> I have really fine, frizzy, curly, color treated hair.  I have used several products that do a good job with the frizz when used with my flat iron.  But, I was hoping I could find a product that would allow me to not have to straighten my hair so often.  I liked the idea of being able to straighten it, then wash it once or twice and still have straight(er), less frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product DID help with the flat iron, after I washed it and let it dry, it was just as frizzy and curly as ever.  I have other products that work better and cost less so, while I&#x27;ll use this up, I probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> My hair feels the same as it does right after I&#x27;ve had a Brazilian Blowout!  It&#x27;s smooth, shiny and soft. I used the Tresemme Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner to ensure that this would work. I followed the directions although I thought my hair might have been a little too wet when I applied the solution. I did section it into 6 sections and used two pumps per section. Maybe it was too much but my hair looks amazing. The true test will come when I go out into some high Chicago humidity!  My husband thinks it looks great. I&#x27;m so happy that I found this product and I hope that it will replace Global Keratin or Brazilian Blowouts. This is much less expensive and so far the results seem to be the same. BB only last 2 months for me and GK lasts about 3 months. My present hair length is about one inch below the chin and I would describe my hair as wavy. If I didn&#x27;t do anything (i.e.. flat iron) it would look fine, but not smooth and sleek like it does now. I&#x27;m a true fan of Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatment!</li>
    <li> This keratin treatment does work but it takes a period of adjustment to master the technique and figure the amount needed to work effectively. The cream has a light pleasant fragrance and pumps out smoothly. It is applied to damp hair, then dried. Hair is then sectioned and straightened with a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy, color treated hair. I found that I only needed two or three pumps as opposed to the recommended 8-10. Be sure to comb through and be careful not to miss an spots when straight ironing and do the recommended three passes. I found that it did smooth my hair although I was hoping for more shine. It did last as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the process a bit time consuming and although I enjoyed the smoothness, I do not like using that much heat on my hair. As it is still quite cold where I am now only time will tell whether this product stands up to humidity induced frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good alternative to expensive salon treatments if you have the time and dexterity to master the technique. Although the results were good, I did not find them impressive enough to warrant regular use. My hair is finally recovering from damage inflicted from over processing so I am reluctant to expose it to so much heat. This product is fine for occasional use.</li>
    <li> The Tresemme 7 Day Keratn Smooth Heat Treatment is a great product. Not only can you use it with flat irons for protection, it actually works on your hair with the heat. For me, it has protected my hair and helps the condition of my hair while using blow dryers and flat irons which is really amazing since those things really can fry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product that really works in conjunction with high heat. There is a whole new line of Tresemme Keratin products and if they work as well as this one, they are probably really great for people who have frizzy ends to help the condition of hair. This product boasts working for seven days even between washes and it&#x27;s been true so far for me. After conditioning, I apply this before blow drying and using the flat iron and it really does make a difference with the condition of my hair. It makes my hair soft and easy to manage. I like this treatment very much.</li>
    <li> While at CVS the other day I was handed samples of Tresemme 7 Day Smooth shampoo, conditioner and this treatment. I was going to give it away or throw it away figuring it would be too heavy for my thinning, fine, frizzy hair, but yesterday I decided to give it a try. I used the shampoo and conditioner as directed, leaving the conditioner on for three minutes or so. When it came to this treatment there were no instructions on the packet. I had been given a brochure but had thrown that away. So, taking my wimpy hair into consideration I used a tiny amount of product on my wet hair. It didn&#x27;t seem to be heavy or greasy so I used a little more, maybe a dime sized amount for my entire head. I worked it through, even on my bangs. I blew my hair dry and flat ironed it. Day one results: My hair was straight,  shiny, not frizzy and not flattened on my head as I&#x27;d feared. Day two results: my hair looks just like it did on day one. I didn&#x27;t even have bed-head when I woke up. The humidity has been in the 60&#x27;s so I know it&#x27;s not lack of humidity in the air making it look smooth. I&#x27;m impressed so far, granted I&#x27;ve only used it once and it&#x27;s only day two, but hmmm . . . maybe this is a substitute for the $28 product I&#x27;ve been using which doesn&#x27;t work as well as this has.&lt;br /&gt;I have my favorite shampoos and conditioners so next time I&#x27;ll use those and this treatment product to see if the results are the same. I&#x27;m aware I didn&#x27;t use this as it&#x27;s intended, but just as a styling aid. If it works that way for me then I&#x27;ll continue to use it that way and return the $28 product. To be continued . . .&lt;br /&gt;P.S. To the reviewer who stated this contains formaldehyde, the ingredients list on the packet I received does not include formaldehyde, just lots of keratin. I&#x27;ve checked several websites that clearly state it&#x27;s formaldehyde free.</li>
    <li> We flat iron our hair and we love this product.  It&#x27;s easy to use and it really does seem to protect our hair, while making it smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true test for us when using an item is if we miss it when we run out.  Well, we ran out and we missed it!  We purchased another one, with an additional for back up, right away.  This product really does work for us.  Because it works so well, we don&#x27;t have to use it every single time we flat iron.  So, that saves us time in the AM when getting ready for our day.</li>
    <li> Right away I was glad to see this bottle was larger than I expected. I have used treatments in the past that came in shockingly small bottles. This treatment comes in a decent size that will last you a little while, depending on how much of it you use. I use plenty each time I do a treatment, since I have super thick hair and it&#x27;s pretty long, about 1/3 of the way down my back. However even having a ton of hair, I don&#x27;t use the 12 pumps that the included directions suggest for my hair length/type. I use probably a little more than half that and find it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I flat iron my hair after drying it with the Tresemme treatment in it and it comes out so much smoother and silkier than it does when I just use flat ironing alone. I&#x27;ve have had Keratin treatments done in the salon when I&#x27;ve been in to get my hair colored, and while I love them, they only last so long and then my hair is back to normal. This Tresemme Keratin Smooth lets me get the same kind of results whenever I want, without having to wait for the next time my roots need touched up by my stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last 6 months or so I&#x27;ve tried out a number of Tresemme hair products and the majority of them have been really good. So much so I&#x27;ve made some of them (like the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Smoothing Serum my go-to hair products for every day use. This Keratin Smooth heat activated treatment is another winner in my book.</li>
    <li> I have 50 year old Irish hair ie dry, long, thick curly hair, so use 8 pumps (Use 4 pumps for normal hair), I rub my palms together and apply from tip to root (basically the driest part of my hair) to reduce frizz. I then blow-dry my hair until COMPLETELY dry. ** Using a flat iron activates the treatment.** Use it on the hottest setting, in small sections, my stylist repeats 2-3 times before working on the next strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply after washing, then conditioning, but before blow drying, I also use it on my hair after washing if I don&#x27;t want to style it but want to go naturally curly and it helps control the frizz while leaving in the curl. Safe to use on color treated hair, does not strip hair of color. For better results, use Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo &amp; 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fyi - the product like many shampoos, hair conditioners, hair gels and skin care products contains DMDM hydantoin, an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative belonging to a class of compounds known as hydantoin and acts as a preservative because of the released formaldehyde.</li>
    <li> If you follow all the directions carefully and take care to maintain the hair afterwards, this treatment really will last a week!  For someone like me, who likes to keep styling time to a minimum, it seemed like a lot of hassle to get the keratin properly applied, dried, and heat ironed - but I can&#x27;t argue with the results.  My hair is soft, smooth, and looks better than it ever has before.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine&lt;br /&gt;If I wash it daily it just gets worse&lt;br /&gt;If I use the wrong styling product it just needs to get washed more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product keeps hair laying smooth and I can skip a day of washing my hair yet still have it look good.</li>
    <li> A waste of money, it did nothing and was gone when I washed my hair</li>
    <li> I tried the 7 day system (well almost).  The shampoo and conditioner were okay at first.  I loved the smell.  I was skeptical about using this to begin with because African American hair needs moisture more than anything, but moved forward based on two reviews I saw from the shampoo and conditioner alone.  Keratin is protein, which devoid of moisture creates a brittle hair texture especially for black hair.  That&#x27;s exactly what happened.  Once I blow dried per the instructions, I started to notice my hair felt slightly dry and brittle.  My plan was to moisturize and use a heat serum after using the system but after blow drying then applying the heat activated treatment, I started to flat iron.  I only did one piece of my hair, when I noticed my hair feeling like plastic baby doll hair.  I applied moisturizer to that piece and it felt horrible.  I immediately stopped and shampooed it all out!  I was so afraid that my hair would stay that coarse hard texture.  Maybe other black women have had success, but I wouldn&#x27;t try this again.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally thick, coarse and wavy. Due to coloring and heat damage it is suffering from breakage (especially the crown) and extreme dryness. The humidity has made it worse. When I blow dry my hair, because of the many layers due to breakage, it doesn&#x27;t blend in together and I look like I have puffy jagged edges. This evening I tried the Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatment which I bought at walmart. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but was hoping at least to get my puffy hair a little smoother. I also wrap my hair to keep it smooth. This made SUCH a huge difference to my hair texture. It is shiny, blended (the layers are blended in with the rest of my hair) and there is no puffiness, just beautiful soft body. I read somewhere that it may be too heavy for fine, limp hair however, my hair texture is such that I need it to be tamed, and I am so surprised at how healthy this has made my hair look and feel. I am beyond satisfied with the results. I finally found my summer product.</li>
    <li> it did nothing for my fine frizzy hair, all it did was make my hair dull.  Supposed to last thru 3 shampoos, but washed out after one shampoo</li>
    <li> Used for the first time today and didn&#x27;t have the serum until after I had already dried my hair.  I put it on my dry hair and flat ironed it and I was amazed at how soft it was!  I can&#x27;t wait to see if there is a difference when I follow the directions!  I can not find a decent OTC (meaning not bought at a hair salon or beauty store) shampoo and conditioner that doesn not dry out my hair and so far so good with this one! And the price isn&#x27;t bad either!</li>
    <li> This product is applied to wet hair. (About 8-10 pumps of product). Then you blow dry and flat iron your hair. It works well.My hair come out smooth, but I can&#x27;t really say that the results are any better, or last any longer, than when I use my silicone-based hair products. This product has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am a college student with very little time to get ready because I am always running around. I wanted to do a professional keratin treatment at my salon that would reduce the time I needed to get ready, I just had not gotten around to going to my salon. When I saw this I decided I would give it a try since I didn&#x27;t have to go out of school to do this and it was cheaper than a salon treatment, so why not give it a shot. I love it. This is my first time using it, so I am not sure if it does last through washes, however, it did make my hair straight and frizz free. I did the treatment at night , and i did used the shampoo and conditioner that go with it, and woke up in the morning and my hair was still straight. Usually my hair will have a little bit of a wave when i sleep on it. Hopefully it lasts through a couple of washes as it says, but we will see. Right now I am in love. For reference I have thin, short hair, that is very curly.  also, the directions say two pumps per section of hair, I only used one. My hair is usually greasy, but not at all with this product. I have nothing bad to say!</li>
    <li> first let me say that about 99% of my reviews are items i purchased on amazon but this one i didn&#x27;t. i got a huge coupon at my pharmacy to try this &amp; plan to return it if i don&#x27;t see any better results in next few days. my hair is super thick, course, color treated &amp; i do use a ceramic flat iron several times a week. lately it&#x27;s been pretty frizzy even though i had a professioal cut &amp; color recently. might be the climate i live in. for what ever reason it&#x27;s pretty hard to get a nice smooth look &amp; i did read reviews offerred up here to make this purchase. in the past my go to hair care items have been argon oil &amp; or bio silk. the price on this is somewhat less hefty than biosilk or good argon oil. so i gave it a try. 3 stars....it&#x27;s ok. not outstanding. i used as directed. my hair is an inverted bob so it&#x27;s pretty short in back. the amount seemed to much so with that in mind next time i will try less for a (hopefully) better result &amp; return it if it&#x27;s not any different. my hair is straight now, moves okay &amp; is shiny enough. but it looks glued to my head.....almost a greasy feel to it.  it more hangs than flows nicely if that makes sense. it may be i&#x27;m not used to this look or feel so i plan to wait a bit to see if i can get a better result. if i do i will edit this review so as to give a better one for those intending to try this. some of you may like the feel....or at least not mind the weighted down feel. but i do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*am revisiting my original review to change my opinion of this product from 3 to 4 stars. just to be as fair as possible. i gave it the \\&quot;acid\\&quot; test today.....colored my hair. So i did a full head color this morning.....used LESS product then 1st time due to the greasy look i got &amp; i mean alot less....same distribution but about 1/2 the product. i let it air dry partially then used a wet to dry flat iron instead of a dry only. this got a much better result. my hair feels much better, doesn&#x27;t look greasy &amp; has a nice shine. i drove today with windows down which took my hair in every direction &amp; when i got home had only to run a brush thru it &amp; it looked fine. so i will not be returning this as i thought i might but will continue to work on the exact result i wanted &amp; if not my hair is alot more manageable &amp; much less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this only for a few days so if anything changes I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say is this: I have very thick hair that is between wavy and curly. It is that unfortunate in between that means one side curls and the other side just looks bad. I love the sleek look a flat iron gives but not the damage and not having to wrestle with the flat iron daily. I have struggled with finding the right combination of products but this line seems to be the magic potion. I have used the shampoo and conditioner and treatment for just about a week now and my hair has never been easier to deal with. It&#x27;s spot on every single time which is consistency I&#x27;ve never been able to pull off for more than maybe a day or two in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a lot less of the treatment than they recommend, you&#x27;ll have to find your perfect amount but I use about 3 pumps for my chin length hair and that is perfect. I&#x27;m hoping the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; continues with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair. Or do I? With this product I don&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t need a loan to afford it.</li>
    <li> awesome !!! got 2 get more !!</li>
    <li> Really great product. Does exactly what it claims to do! Wonderful smooth shiny hair. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is week two and so far so good. I am an African American who has not had a relaxer in 7 months but did have two keratin treatments during that time. My treatments didn&#x27;t last much longer than a relaxer and so, rather than keep paying for keratin treatments that last only a month and a half, I&#x27;m trying tresamme smooth to extend the time in between treatments. I&#x27;m liking it so far.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today and it works REALLY well. I only used about 5-6 pumps for my shoulder length hair. Next, I straightened my hair with a hot iron. Soft, silky, shiny and smells great!</li>
    <li> I got this stuff figuring that some people liked it, others didn&#x27;t and for my budget, it was cheap enough so what could be the harm in trying?  I followed the instructions but tested this on a few strand first to make sure it was safe for my hair. I have naturally dark brown, wavy/curly hair that&#x27;s been bleached platinum and I try to avoid or minimize heat styling because of the damage. I figured this stuff might make it possible for me to go a long time between stylings and still have my hair look smooth (left to it&#x27;s own devices it looks like a rat&#x27;s nest). It didn&#x27;t seem to damage the test strand so I went for it. I used my blow dryer and then iron (at 370 degrees because any hotter and my hair will burn) and I noticed a few things. Firstly, it was harder to get my brush through while blow drying, and then I did have to be extra diligent with the iron because the treatment was sort of sticky. But when I was done, my hair did look great. It felt soft and moved well, didn&#x27;t feel sticky anymore and overall I liked the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wash often, as my hair isn&#x27;t oily and I try to let it rest as much as possible, so I first washed it four days after the initial use. And I let it air dry most of the way then helped a bit with the blow-dryer (low heat this time). And it did nothing for me. Then I went a few more days, washed and blow dried and it was as though I hadn&#x27;t used this stuff. So, it seems to me, that the effects don&#x27;t last past a washing (and I use only gentle. sulfate-free shampoo etc.). I eventually used the treatment a second time, and again, my hair looked great. Then I washed it after a few days and didn&#x27;t let it air dry at all, instead, using the blowdryer immediately, and still it seems the stuff had washed out because my hair was back to it&#x27;s usual state. Oddly, though, now that I&#x27;ve used it twice, I feel that there is a residue in my hair and after some use, I think it might be doing unkind things to my hair in general. When I&#x27;ve styled myhair in the past (just straight) and slept on it, I wake up and it looks fine. With this stuff, my hair gets randomly bent and stays that way no matter what unless I shower and re-style. And my scalp feels like there is buildup on it. Finally, I can&#x27;t be sure why, but my hair feels more damaged than usual and this treatment is the only thing I&#x27;ve done differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my overall impression is this: I&#x27;d use it again if I had a reason to style my hair extra nice for an event, but I won&#x27;t count on it to work past one night. It takes twice as long to style with initial application than without this stuff. And I&#x27;m definitely now going to use a clarifying shampoo to get the residue out of my hair asap, because I&#x27;m not a fan of how this feels past day one. Perhaps if I had used a higher temperature to iron it (salon treatments tend to use over 400 degrees to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the keratin) it would&#x27;ve delivered on the promise, but my hair can&#x27;t withstand that kind of heat without serious damage so it wasn&#x27;t an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only really good thing I can say about this is that it didn&#x27;t turn my hair yellow,as I was afraid it might. I got a keratin treatment at a salon once that turned my pale platinum color highlighter yellow. Apparently keratin is naturally yellowish and this is a thing that happens to pale blonds when they use it. That also makes me wonder if the keratin amount in this stuff is actually worth anything, but I&#x27;m no cosmetic scientist so that&#x27;s all just anecdotal speculation.</li>
    <li> It was a great product but I have alot of hair and I wish this was a larger bottle so I could use it more times</li>
    <li> My wife always complains about her frizzy hair. She has tried MANY different products and has not been happy with most of them. When I got this for her, she clearly rolled her eyes. I think she had given up. Her hair has also thinned out a little, which makes her a little self conscious, and sometimes a little frustrated. Grudgingly she tried Tresemme 7 day keratin smooth heat activated treatment.  Needless to see, she is thrilled. My wife is now happier, looking at her hair. She was also amazed that her hair stayed unfrizzed for about a week. I will note that the humidity has not started yet, and this review may change, but for now, she is a huge fan, and I suspect that even later, she will be just as happy. Her does not look or feel greasy, and just feels and looks much better and much healthier. She is hooked!</li>
    <li> I liked this when I first dried and flat ironed it in, but after the treatment, upon washing the 2nd day, while drying hair, it started vreaking off in chunks in my brush!! I was horrified!  My hair is medium fine, but i have used other straighteners over the years, like keratin smoothering ones, professional treatments which worked fine. This is the worst breakage and experience with a smoothing treatment or even a perm that I have EVER had. This product should be off the market in my opinion. I have a prof cosmotology license and i assumed since it was only a 7 day treatment it couldn&#x27;t be too strong .... Well BUYER BEWARE! Now i have to wait a year for my long previously good conditioned silky hair to all grow back.  I contacted the company for a refund and got no response-</li>
    <li> It works great! But entirely too overpriced for me to like the product. I&#x27;m using it, but only keeping it as a reminder to not get screwed over next time</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time. I washed and conditioned my hair with Suave keratin infusion I think it&#x27;s called. That&#x27;s what I had and I happen to like those products. I sectioned my damp medium length fine hair into 4 sections and I applied 2 pumps of the product to each section, root to tip as stated in the directions. I dried my hair and then flat ironed it, going over each section 3 times with the flat iron, which I normally would only go over my hair one time with the flat iron. I really liked the results. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day because it&#x27;s on the dry side. I wash my hair after I work out twice a week. My hair stayed nice and manageable pretty much the entire week. I noticed that my hair was different, in a good way, yeah! And I noticed because my hair was behaving better because of this product, that I didn&#x27;t  need as much hairspray. I have a love/hate relationship with hairspray. I&#x27;m in Florida and it&#x27;s ridiculously humid. My hair will normally frizz just going out to my driveway or it will even frizz a little bit just being in the house. Now here&#x27;s an interesting twist, since I really liked this product, I went out and bought the shampoo and conditioner that they say to use first and i bought the keratin smooth cream serum. I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I washed and conditioned my hair with the shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve only used them once and the jury is still out as to whether or not I like the shampoo and conditioner. As mentioned, I do like Suave keratin infusion and you can not beat the price. I then put the keratin smooth cream serum on my hair and I proceeded to blow dry my hair. When I was almost finished drying my hair, something just wasn&#x27;t right. My hair seemed frizzy in this one particular spot that I have an issue with and it seemed horribly staticky. I knew if I didn&#x27;t do something that my hair would be awful the next day. I grabbed the keratin smooth heat activated treatment and I put two pumps on my dry hair. I know this is nothow you&#x27;re supposed to use the product, but I was really unhappy with how my hair was coming out because of the keratin cream serum product, so I thought I would try this. I brushed the product through my dry hair, then I added a third pump, which I might not have needed and I proceeded to flat iron my hair and I could tell that the heat activated treatment made a difference. It made my hair better and it wasn&#x27;t staticky anymore. I am really impressed with this product and I don&#x27;t want to be without it now. The Keratin smooth cream serum is horrible and I threw it out after one use. Total waste of money, total garbage and made my hair really really weird. So that&#x27;s my review. I guess it turned out to be long, but wanted to share my experience with this great product. Get it, try it. It makes my hair better and I love that.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels.</li>
    <li> Having battled frizzy hair for years, I was thrilled to find keratin treatments. No hair damage like Japanese straightening, but the expense of having to do it every few months wazoo much for me. I also don&#x27;t have time to blow and flat iron it each day. The 7 day treatment makes straightening easier and last longer (I would say mine gradually wore out after about 4-5 shampoos but I have very stubborn hair)&lt;br /&gt;The product gives my hair an almost sticky feeling when it went in but worked out fine after blowing it dry and flat ironing it.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be purchasing more especially with the summer humidity coming.</li>
    <li> Just made my hair greasy</li>
    <li> This hair treatment didn&#x27;t make much of a difference on my hair. I have long, thick, wavy hair with a decent amount of frizz. For now, I&#x27;m going back to using coconut oil from the cooking oil on my hair. It does a much better job of helping me tame the beast.</li>
    <li> I did the unthinkable!! Colored my hair AND tried a new product at the same time. My hair will frizz if someone breathes on it, this product is working under 98% HUMIDITY!! I am truly excited,just cancelled a $150 Keratin treatment that I was going to get....stylist is NOT excited.LOL!!</li>

    <li> My hair is incredibly fine, splits easily, full of disorganized wavy curls, and naturally ULTRA FRIZZY all the time whether it&#x27;s been brushed, combed, or left alone entirely.  Frizzy is the name of my game, it&#x27;s always been this way. This product is good for controlling frizz on my hair short term and I like it, especially the smell, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t stand up to a wash. Maybe if you&#x27;re the kind of person who has &amp;#34;bad hair days&amp;#34; this would work, but my entire LIFE is a bad hair day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always searching for the holy grail anti-frizz product that will finally calm my hair. This one is fine for a high-maintenance date night hairstyle if you seal it after you&#x27;re done with hairspray, but if you&#x27;re someone who needs products just to look normal on an average day it&#x27;s not the secret weapon you&#x27;re looking for. Using this product without hairspray, the tightly compacted curls I set my hair into with a curler will come apart into individual frizzy strands within a couple hours... and just using it on my hair naturally without re-curling it&#x27;s not effective at all.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine, slightly wavy (more frizzy) hair and this didn&#x27;t do much for me. Did not notice any difference after first wash, it was like I hadn&#x27;t used anything.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It really leaves your hair feeling thick and silky  My husband has long, kinky black Mediterranean type hair and we were able to straighten it with this product.  I like it for my hair, too!  Makes it easy to do hair during busy work week, almost don&#x27;t have to do anything but comb my shoulder length hair in the morning and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
    <li> i love this thing.. im a returning customer.. lol</li>
    <li> I have used the Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatment around 4 - 5 times now, and although I have not has long lasting results, the same day effects are quite impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend only using this product when you have the time to do a full blow dry and straightening of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most mornings I jump out of the shower, squish some product into my wet hair, and run off to work. This particular keratin treatment product, however, gets best results when used with heat source such as a flat iron. The product information that comes with the treatment recommends that you separate your hair into small sections and use 3-4 pumps of the product per each section. This seemed like WAY too much to me, and I used about half of the amount most of the time.  Each time I applied the product and took the time to really \\&quot;do\\&quot; my hair, I felt that it left it looking smooth and really helped to cut back on the frizz that my hair typically has -- especially after straightening. I could still feel the product in my hair, however, which is something that I typically don&#x27;t like and I didn&#x27;t feel like the results lasted much past my first shower after doing the treatment despite the product page claiming longer lasting manageability. Perhaps if I also used a companion product, the 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo and Conditioner throughout the week, I would have had better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think that if you are looking for something that is going to give you great results for a specific day or function this product is great, but if you are looking for something long term, I say keep looking!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten the real Keratin treatment three times and was just looking for something to use in between treatments (and to save money). This wasn&#x27;t the answer (sadly). Yes, my hair was straight after applying the solution, blow drying and flat ironing it in. But the next time I washed my hair... it was back to my curly, frizzy hair. The commercial is definitely misleading (but that&#x27;s marketing for you!). It was only $7 so at least it wasn&#x27;t an overly expensive waste of money.</li>
    <li> Like many women trying to manage African American hair styles, destructive permanent chemical relaxers was the only thing that stopped the reverting process back to coiled and curly hair. The effects are damaged, brittle, and broken off hair. Tresemme 7 Day smooth system provides very straight hair that is not permanent. It allows greater versatility for those of us who also embrace natual hairstyles. I chopped my chemically relaxed hair off last November and have been searching for products that allows me to enjoy all kinds of looks, including natural, straight,  afro puffs, or braids. This is a great option that relaxes my curl pattern by prolonging the blow dry and flat iron effect, on the occasion that I want to wear my hair straight for a week. When I want to embrace my soft coils again, I wash my hair, and add olive or coconut oils. I am very happy this product works for my texture also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great option for those who are cutting out the permanent chemical process and evolving to embracing the texture and creativity we were blessed with.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this product. I was just hoping that it would protect my style from humidity. I never expected it to last through an actual shampoo.  Well, I used all the products as directed and it still took about an hour and fifteen minutes at the highest temperature on my Chi flatiron to do my very frizzy, color treated, almost waist - length hair.  I was first disappointed that my hair was still kinda puffy.  Then I realized that it had no shine.  I could have dealt with that if it was humidity - resistant.  But it really wasn&#x27;t. The first time I tried it I sweated on the back of my neck and the hair which was near that moisture immediately got frizzy and wavy.  The second time I tried it was a rainy day.  Within a few hours it had puffed up just from the humidity.  I didn&#x27;t get it wet in the rain AT ALL.  I think that I&#x27;ll just continue to use a heat protectant product which gives me sleeker, silkier and shinier results.  I am extremely jealous of those who seem to have excellent results using this product!  I wish it had worked for me!</li>
    <li> I did this sleeking program three times in the last month, each time with better results.  It essentially extends a flat iron straightening for an entire week, even if you shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key was reading the instructions exactly: apply to clean, damp dry hair with just a TINY bit of product.  Comb through, dry.  Then flat iron normally.  The first time I used too much product and felt like the hair was too greasy.  The second time I used just a bit, and when I flat ironed it felt really smooth and nice, with good shine.  But I used too much hairspray and that made my hair sort of limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third time was perfect:  a great finish, and then when I shampooed, every other day, it still felt sleek and nice, like the conditioning was baked in.  Tangles weren&#x27;t a problem with my long hair (for once), and it combed out nice.  When I blew it dry, it fell into place as if I had flat ironed, and I hadn&#x27;t.  I figure I saved 2 or 3 flat iron sessions in a week, which is a great deal of time to save.  Even without blowing my hair dry, just combing out wet with a wide tooth comb, gave it great smooth results to my wavy and dry colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this better than the Keratin Smoothing Cream that you apply with each time...this saved time and felt less greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great find!</li>
    <li> Works as it says it it supposed to work!  Makes hair shinny and straight easily, and it lasts!</li>
    <li> Great product with a great price</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s other smoothing creams that are easier to use. You have to do your hair into sections and apply several different pumps then comb it through. It doesn&#x27;t reduce frizz very well. It does make hair easy to straighten. I&#x27;d give it more stars IF it reduce frizz better,sadly it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair feel gunky, dry, and rough.  My husband said  my hair looked dried out and flat, not the usually smooth and silky.  My hair was weighed down by the product and didn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s usually flow.  I can&#x27;t stand the smell either.  I love other Tresemme&#x27;s products but this stuff was awful.  I&#x27;ll be returning the keratin shampoo, conditioner, and this treatment cream back to Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is naturally wavy.  I have fine hair but lots of it.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I was expecting my hair to look different, but it didn&#x27;t look any different than if I were to put in a different gloss product before straightening my hair. Considering the whole selling point is a 7 day straightening treatment, I expected some defining results. This is a good cheap hair straightening gloss, but don&#x27;t expect the product of your dreams. The 7 day keratin is a marketing angle meant to grab your interest only. I may give this another shot one day, once my other hair products run out but with my standards lowered.</li>
    <li> Im a man , this product works , but it didn&#x27;t make it silky smooth , but it did increase its manageability and flexibilty , if your hair is very hard don&#x27;t expect this product to work , the thing that i love about is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any long term side effects , all of the effects expire within a week or to be sure a month , so you don&#x27;t have to wait to long to try something else .</li>
    <li> seems ok but probably a crock just like all hair products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find something that works better than argan oil on my hair. Apparently this wasn&#x27;t it either. My hair ended up drier than usual, especially at the ends. I also bought the smooth creme serum and even with that it didn&#x27;t work as well as my argan oil. Oh well, I&#x27;ll keep testing things out.</li>
    <li> perfect for curly hair</li>
    <li> When used as directed, leaves hair feeling dirty but yet still does not offer reduced frizz beyond first shampoo following treatment. If you try using less, hair feels clean and moves nicely but still doesn&#x27;t maintain frizz-free status after washing. So basically it took me three times as long to flat iron my hair per the instructions but I got no extended hold from the use of the product.  Poor choice for my thick, curly, frizzy hair.  Wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> A few years ago, I spent wayyyy too much money getting my hair &amp;#34;straightened&amp;#34; at a hair salon. I was tired of the frizz, and thought this was the answer. It worked for the first few days, and then it was done. Money down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Tresemme and their Keratin treatment. Decent price, and something I can handle - a few pumps into my hair, flat iron (which I normally use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results? SMOOOOOOTH. So smooth. I am so much happier with this than I was after my salon experiment. For what it&#x27;s worth, my hair has a slight natural wave and straightens really well on its own. Different hair types may have different experiences.</li>
    <li> This product did control my frizzes throughout the first day. After the first application, blow-dry and flat iron my hair was smooth and slick. It was beautiful. But after one washing my hair went back to its natural state: frizz, curls, and more frizz. Sigh, nothing seems to work on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have moderately curly hair this product might keep your hair straight and smooth for 7 days and through 3 washing, but if your hair negatively reacts to humidity this Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Treatment may leave you a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> After a year of trying the CG method I was tired of still having to condition wash my hair daily and having an unpredictable result. So I purchased this and wow... I have protein sensitive hair when Cg washing but with this method it is truly amazing! I use the shampoo and conditioner then the treatment and let air dry for the night. In the morning 20 mins straightening with the flat irons and good to go. I only wash my hair twice a week and even being caught in some light drizzly rain my hair is still lovely and straight, a few waves but even nicer!&lt;br /&gt;I do alternate with the bumble and bumble straight but won&#x27;t repurchase B and B once finished and only use this.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you tresemme!!!!</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with how this works, especially for the price. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other drugstore keratin treatments, although I have gotten expensive ones at a salon. This doesn&#x27;t make my hair quite as sleek as the salon treatment, but for a fraction of the price? It&#x27;s great. I used the shampoo and conditioner as well as this treatment and I could tell as soon as I started blow drying that something was different. My coarse, dry, curly, color-treated hair was already softer and easier to manage. The flat iron was easier to use as well. On day 2 after shampooing and it still looks great. Haven&#x27;t washed yet so can&#x27;t attest to how well it works after a wash.</li>
    <li> I used the whole system: i.e.: shampoo, condition and treatment and it works!!!  For me, at least. I am of mixed ethnicity and have very frizzy, very curly hair. I used the shampoo/condition and then a small amount of the treatment. I used a large round brush to blow dry and hit it with a flat iron set at 419 degrees. It&#x27;s straight, silky, smooth, shiny, soft, easy, amazing!! And no burnt looking ends or frizz. Now lets see how it stands up to the 90 degree weather and humidity my county in GA is supposed to be having this weekend. And for the next seven days….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep everyone posted.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product for people who use a lot of heat in their hair. I don&#x27;t use a flat iron often, but when I do, I want to make sure that my hair is protected from heat damage. This heat activated treatment is very easy to spread through my hair, and it actually takes a relatively small amount of to get it distributed evenly through my hair. It has a nice fragrance that dissipates rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the glossy sheen that models and actresses are able to get in photographs but that most of us rarely achieve in real life. This product has probably gotten me closer to that gloss than any other product I&#x27;ve used. It really works well to keep my hair straight for several days, and even through early morning mist and light drizzles. However, the product claims that it will keep your hair styled for seven days, even with washing. Admittedly, I didn&#x27;t use the full line of Keratin Smooth products, so that might have been the difference, but my hair did not stay straight after washing. It did, however, stay straight between washings, and it maintained its shine entirely.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions to a \\&quot;T.\\&quot; Of course, my hair looked gorgeous on day-one. But, it always does when I use a flat-iron. The real trouble occurred after the first washing. My hair felt strange, and the look was frizzy. I tried to shampoo it out later that day, but the strange feel was still there ... and my hair still looked terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low, low price and \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; ingredients were a warning sign that I should have heeded. And, I did become VERY nervous when I read here that this product contains formaldehyde (very dangerous to living-things). I feared my hair would never recover. Nonetheless, I am happy to report that after several washings, my hair is its normal, silky self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately tossed the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are much better-off to use a more natural heat-guard like [[ASIN:B0058CJV50 Garnier Fructis Style Sleek &amp; Shine Flat Iron Perfector Straightening Mist]] and a [[ASIN:B00383HHT8 T3 73500 Single Pass Flat Iron]]. It is never worth it to put the quality of your hair (or potentially your health) in jeopardy.</li>
    <li> After reading rave reviews about this product I decided to give it a try. I have thin, fine, and frizzy hair naturally. I wash with a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner(Organix awapuhi ginger and keratin) then towel dried my hair. I applied 7 pumps throughout my hair to ensure that I would be frizz-free. After blow drying I thought my hair felt so velvety smooth and healthy. After flat ironing it felt 100% frizz-free. It definitely transformed how my hair felt and I am confident that it will last since I only wash my hair twice a week. Using dry shampoo on days when my hair looks a little oily. I also bought the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Heat Protectant to spritz on my hair before blow drying. I am in love with the results and will repurchase. Two thumbs up for Tresemme!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have a stupid amount of static in my hair at all times, and this stuff really helps me keep it under control.</li>
    <li> I loved this product so much. It smelled amazing! And it protected my hair from the heat of my curling or straighter. Would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Yes, I know that sounds crazy but it is true for me.  I have fine, thin, straight-to-slightly wavy that is very strawlike and frizzy.  It tangles and knots easily.  Tresemme 7th Day Keratin Smooth Heat-Activated Treatment leaves it smooth.  The smoothness really does last for 7 days just like it says on the bottle.  I shampoo about twice a week and I only need to use it every other shampoo (which is about once every 7 days).  My hair is long, about 4 inches past my shoulders, but because it is fine and thin I divide it into 4 sections and apply 2 pumps of product to each section, comb it through, then blow dry and flatiron.  I do not use the hottest setting on my flatiron because I am afraid of damaging my hair.  I find the product works just fine for me with a medium heat setting.  I also use my own shampoo/conditioner (not Tresemme) even though Tresemme recommends you use the 7 Day Smooth shampoo/conditioner.  I am very pleased with the results using my own shampoo.  It has a pleasant smell and does not weigh my hair down or make it greasy.  My hair looks full, shiny and healthy and that has really boosted my confidence!  I never want to be without this product.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair, not kinky not curly but wavy and I have flat ironed my hair for years and in the process, damaged my hair with the heat of the daily flat iron....I paid $400.00 two years ago at a salon for the \\&quot;Brazilian straightening\\&quot; but my hair fell out and it was so flat that my hair was limp as hell for two months...so I just tried Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth...first it&#x27;s pretty easy to apply....it did not damage my hair at all  The final result after blow drying my hair and then flat ironing as directed was pretty great.  My hair definitely felt smoother and the next day all I had to do was to just touch up my hair with my flat iron but I didn&#x27;t have to spend time to actually straighten it as I normally have to.  I don&#x27;t know yet if it truly lasts through 7 shampoos but I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair everyday anyway.  For the price and the results, I would definitely continue to use this product!  I am giving this 4 stars because nothing is perfect but this is close, at least on my hair!</li>
    <li> My concern with this was that it would make my hair feel greasy or dirty by the end of the day, I am one of those people that must wash their hair daily.  This lasted on my hair for a good 5 days with daily washings.  It make it smoother and I had less fly-aways.  My hair is short but I did seem to use a lot of it...but if it lasts for almost a week, that is a pretty good trade off.  Price is reasonable also.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get great results with this product, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the fault of the product or because my hair is pretty damaged from bleaching right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all I have long hair, so I had to section into 6 sections and use 2 pumps per section per directions. (that is a LOT of product)  My hair looked pretty smooth and soft the first day, but by the second it felt greasy and looked flat and grody. I washed out the product and my hair went right back to curly, so there goes the &#x27;straight for days even if you wash it&#x27; theory. I tried again with six sections and one pump per section; this made my hair able to go two days without washing. I didn&#x27;t get any smoother results than I normally get just using Fekkai glossing cream and my flatiron....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly my long, curly hair would be ideal to try this product on, but it just didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. Maybe the fact that my hair is damaged is why I didn&#x27;t get results for my hair. I hate to blame the product but, it just didn&#x27;t do anything that I can&#x27;t already get with products I currently own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the suble scent.</li>
    <li> This product has a lot of steps to use it. Five to be exact. Beyond that, you have to do it multiple times to reap the optimum results. So I guess the question becomes, is it worth it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple answer is yes. You will see results. My hair is looking better having used this heat activated treatment. The difference is noticeable from other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive treatment, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find a better value. I was really impressed with what this product was capable of.</li>
    <li> This is heavy duty stuff!  If it will work on my hair, it&#x27;ll work on anybody&#x27;s, and it works.  My hair is very long, thick, and fine.  It has a mind of its own.  I&#x27;ve experimented with using the Keratin 7 Day Heat Activated Treatment on and off for a month and can report that my hair is much, much better with the product than without.  It is very long-lasting, has a pleasant fragrance and does the job, if you follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product with both a flat iron and a curling iron.  It seems to need the extended hair contact of the flat iron to perform best, though I liked the result with the curling iron.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hair is so frizzy, thick and damaged. I am always looking for a good way to tame it. This product has managed to do that! I only divided my hair into two sections instead of the suggested 7 and I used 3 or 4 pumps per section. My hair came out nice and smooth and my frizz is finally tamed!</li>
    <li> Used for about 4- 5 weeks, worked great nice and smooth, BUT after 4 weeks of use on my daughters hair I started noticing lots of breakage and fly aways. Upon further inspection there is massive hair breakage !! Some from 3 inch long chunks to whole sections of her hair broken off 2 inches from her scalp.</li>
    <li> This worked okay the first couple of times I used it, until I had a severe allergic reaction. I&#x27;m not really allergic to anything else, so it was quite frightening. My eyes watered for days, I developed an intense skin rash on my brow and cheekbones (itchy, bumpy but not pimply, dry and scaly) - honest to god, I thought I was developing rosacea or something. If it is rosacea, I have to give up red wine, caffeine, exercise and spicy foods, which sounds like a circle of hell. If it&#x27;s an allergic reaction to the crazy toxic crap in here, though, I only have to give up a pretty meh product, so on the whole it&#x27;s a net win. Caveat emptor for real.</li>
    <li> I tried this twice and it did nothing for me. I used it, ironed my hair, waited a day and washed it. Both times my hair was right back to being wavy all over and frizzy on top. It also made my hair look dry and it felt caked with gunk. It took away the gloss and shine I usually have. I wish so badly it had worked! I&#x27;m going to take it back.</li>
    <li> This product was supposed to last 7 days so I wouldn&#x27;t have to re-apply conditioner every day. It stopped working after 3 days. I found myself having to revert back to styling gel for the remainder of the week to get my hair to stay straight after being ironed.</li>
    <li> This is a God sent product for nappy hair, I apply it after washing my hair combined with Shea butter transitioning milk then blow dry my hair. It leaves my hair silkyyyy smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> Incredible at the first 5 days using it.... but is like &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; on the next... is similar to a cream to brush your hair...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell if this product is doing what it says it is. It says it offers heat protection and it is the first heat protectant that I have used. I only straighten my curly hair occasionally, so I don&#x27;t have much experience with what it feels like to have heat damaged hair. This product has a scent that smells better than burning hair, but smells like a fake floral scent. I would say that the scent lingers throughout the day, but again smells better than burnt hair. It is a pretty light scent, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I have tested this product about 3-4 times now. One of those days had a high humidity and this product wasn&#x27;t able to keep my hair straight and flat throughout the day versus not using the product. My hair is very thick and each time I have tried to follow the directions (Dividing hair into 6 sections and using 2 pumps per section) but also I have been worried about oversaturating my hair, so I have probably used a little bit less than &amp;#34;directed,&amp;#34; but the amount recommended seems excessive when you see how big the size of each pump is. This product also claims that it can last through three washes or the week. I haven&#x27;t tested the week, but I have tested the three washes theory. When I wash my hair after using this product I don&#x27;t notice a continuation of the straightness that I had before the shower. I think that it is impossible to expect that the straightness will stay despite washing it. Perhaps it has not worked because I am not using the shampoo and conditioner that are part of this line.&lt;br /&gt; To sum it up, I think the best use for this product is a heat protectant.</li>
    <li> This product flat out works! IT WORKS! It has no harmful chemicals, smells wonderful, and my hair looks amazeballs for over a week! I have fine, blonde, highlighted hair that falls below my shoulders. I don&#x27;t use as much of the product as recommended because when I did it made my hair a little heavy and flat. I have discovered just the right amount to completely cover all my hair without making it heavy - trial and error is typical with any new product. You REALLY do have to use a sulfate AND sodium free shampoo and conditioner if you want the results to last after a few shampoos. I highly recommend this product if you want to get rid of the frizz and have some seriously smooth, sexy hair!</li>
    <li> I use this with my Perfecter and it tames my super frizzy, super wavy hair into sleek shine.  May not last 7 days, but it will last for 2-3.</li>
