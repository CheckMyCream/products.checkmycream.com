      <li>ever I love it !</li>
      <li>My hair is not frizzy any more!</li>
      <li>Nice hair dryer</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness based on my own hair</li>
      <li>very good i really like</li>
      <li>but I still like my old dryer best which is no longer made.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
      <li>Hair dries faster and looks smooth and shiny!  </li>
      <li>Very well made, and works great.</li>
      <li>I love to wash my hair now~</li>
      <li>I like a lower setting to style my hair better.</li>
      <li>Its a bit pricey but the money is all worth it!!</li>
      <li>So buy it for the functionality, but not for the sound level or the weight.</li>
      <li>after drying the hair, it looks smooth and shining.</li>
      <li>but i do enjoy the feel of her bouncy hair</li>
      <li>I havenever seen such a good eye dryer before.</li>
      <li>i didnt care that much abt a hair dryer so most of time my hair was fuzzy.</li>
      <li>It is expensive, but I love it and my hair feels great!</li>
      <li>it also used for facial which is amazing.</li>
      <li>it really worth it.</li>
      <li>I can use the &amp;#34;Scalp setting&amp;#34; but even that is a bit powerful.</li>
      <li>Was it worth the price?</li>
      <li>After drying my hair with this hair dryer today, my hair appears fine and smooth and it only took me 10 minutes to do so.</li>
      <li>super fast drying...</li>
      <li>but worth the money haha</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen this hair dryer on so many taiwan beauty talk shows since last year and were always interested in it.</li>
      <li>Packaged very well!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really light, very quiet, and dispenses a small burst of cool air from above the nuzzle, which is unexpectedly brilliant.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see that much difference to be honest in the end result as I get with any other dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The chord is a bit too short, but with an extension is fine.</li>
      <li>I even didn&#x27;t mention to my hobby how much this thing cost.</li>
      <li>this hair dryer really works with its function choices.</li>
      <li>It also folds so it doesn&#x27;t take too much space in my luggage when I travel.</li>
      <li>So, as American blow dryers go, this one is pretty good, especially on the SET setting, but it&#x27;s certainly NOT exceptionally quiet.</li>
      <li>She says it works better than any other hair dryer she has ever owned.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it for anyone with girlfriends that take forever to get ready.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a decent dryer....</li>
      <li>dry hair very fast!</li>
      <li>First, this is NOT a particularly quiet hair dryer.</li>
      <li>You can choose &amp;#34;scalp mode&amp;#34; for sensitive scalp and &amp;#34;skin mode&amp;#34; when applying face mask.</li>
      <li>so if you have thick hair, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>I spent more money on this dryer than I have any other before.</li>
      <li>As a guy i think it&#x27;s ridiculous to pay anymore more than $20 for a hair dryer</li>
      <li>Got this for the girlfriend, who broke her older model of the same hair dryer.</li>
      <li>but i can tell you that having this hair dryer significantly decreases the prep time for the said girl by at LEAST 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Since I have frizzy and natural curly hair, I&#x27;m been spending tons of money on flat irons and anti-frizz styling products.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer works reasonably well, but I beg to differ with a couple of the comments made by other reviewers of this model.</li>
      <li>My problem is I have thin, fine hair</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve using this dryer for 2 months and decided to get one for my sis and my mom too. It&#x27;s different than the regular dryer cuz it comes w/ multi-functions. You can choose &amp;#34;scalp mode&amp;#34; for sensitive scalp and &amp;#34;skin mode&amp;#34; when applying face mask. Its a bit pricey but the money is all worth it!!</li>
    <li> very good i really like it also used for facial which is amazing. kinda expensive. but worth the money haha</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this hair dryer on so many taiwan beauty talk shows since last year and were always interested in it. Finally I&#x27;ve decided to purchase it on Amazon and OMG it&#x27;s beyond my satisfaction! Since I have frizzy and natural curly hair, I&#x27;m been spending tons of money on flat irons and anti-frizz styling products. After drying my hair with this hair dryer today, my hair appears fine and smooth and it only took me 10 minutes to do so. I would recommend Panasonic Nano care hair dryer to everyone!</li>
    <li> It is expensive, but I love it and my hair feels great! My hair is not frizzy any more! Recommended.</li>
    <li> dry hair very fast! I love it!</li>
    <li> I like it. after drying the hair, it looks smooth and shining. Only thing is bothering me is the smell after you turn on the machine. It smells like melted plastic.</li>
    <li> amazing！you can feel the change, make you hair perfect!</li>
    <li> Nice hair dryer ever I love it !</li>
    <li> Nothing to say! just perfect product!</li>
    <li> this is best for me !!you will got this!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Packaged very well!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works reasonably well, but I beg to differ with a couple of the comments made by other reviewers of this model. First, this is NOT a particularly quiet hair dryer. Having been used to really quiet dryers in Europe, where the EU sets noise standards on such appliances, I have constantly been frustrated by the obnoxious noise levels of hair dryers here in the U.S. So, as American blow dryers go, this one is pretty good, especially on the SET setting, but it&#x27;s certainly NOT exceptionally quiet. Nor is it lighter in weight than the dryer I currently have. So buy it for the functionality, but not for the sound level or the weight. However, one big advantage is that this dryer has a normal size plug, rather than the ginormous ones with the pop-out breaker that are common on other products sold in the U.S. Our bathroom outlets already have the pop-out breakers so we don&#x27;t need them on appliances used in the bathroom, so not having to accommodate the giant plug is a big plus.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! this is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s really light, very quiet, and dispenses a small burst of cool air from above the nuzzle, which is unexpectedly brilliant. It also folds so it doesn&#x27;t take too much space in my luggage when I travel. The chord is a bit too short, but with an extension is fine.</li>
    <li> best hair dryer ever!!!! i didnt care that much abt a hair dryer so most of time my hair was fuzzy. this hair dryer really works with its function choices.</li>
    <li> Very well made, and works great. I have really thick hair and it gets the job done in about 5 min.</li>
    <li> I spent more money on this dryer than I have any other before. Was it worth the price? I don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a decent dryer....super fast drying...so if you have thick hair, you&#x27;ll love it. My problem is I have thin, fine hair and I&#x27;d prefer a lower setting. I can use the &amp;#34;Scalp setting&amp;#34; but even that is a bit powerful. I like a lower setting to style my hair better. This just blows it in all directions. I don&#x27;t see that much difference to be honest in the end result as I get with any other dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t send it back...does the job but I still like my old dryer best which is no longer made.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she LOVES it.  She says it works better than any other hair dryer she has ever owned.  My wife is happy, so I am happy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful experience! I love to wash my hair now~</li>
    <li> Got this for the girlfriend, who broke her older model of the same hair dryer. As a guy i think it&#x27;s ridiculous to pay anymore more than $20 for a hair dryer but i do enjoy the feel of her bouncy hair so i guess it&#x27;s a good trade off.

    <li> the quality is very good</li>
    <li> Very expensive item, but it really worth it. I havenever seen such a good eye dryer before.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Hair dries faster and looks smooth and shiny!  I took one star off is because of the cost.  I even didn&#x27;t mention to my hobby how much this thing cost.</li>
