      <li>I use it for my mustache and sideburns and it works great.</li>

      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I discovered this product!!</li>
      <li>Sulfates aren&#x27;t good for your skin, anyway ...</li>

      <li>Very easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It works if you follow the directions, it does smell VERY strong and your head will smell for a week or so.  </li>
      <li>IF YOU DONT SEE DESIRED COLOR RIGHT AWAY!!!</li>
      <li>After all I did have it around for about a year until I noticed it was not doing the job as before so, I purchased more and here I am, writing a rave review on this</li>
      <li>For shampoo you can also use the Shea Moisture products which are sold in many stores including CVS, just look at the label</li>
      <li>Love love love this.</li>
      <li>sure it&#x27;s &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It also, does not burn or have chemicals so its totally safe to use.</li>
      <li>The product claims that since it has no chemicals, users should allow more time for it to work.  </li>
      <li>I love this hair color, been dying my hair for over 20 years.</li>
      <li>Great product fast shipping</li>
      <li>A teaspoon of this stuff for 40 minutes comes out perfect for me and actually lasts longer than JFM.</li>
      <li>This color is ok.  </li>
      <li>MUCH better product.</li>
      <li>For shampoo you can also use the Shea Moisture products which are sold in many stores including CVS, just look at the label</li>
      <li>sure it&#x27;s &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34;.hen rinse off.  </li>
      <li>I was going for salt and pepper look but it would be nice to know I could get full coverage.</li>
      <li>Very easy, I clean the house while iit&#x27;s in my hair.</li>
      <li>I also experienced mild burnings sensitivity but no sores like just for men so my skin just must be more sensitive.</li>
      <li>Also, the smell is a bit strong.</li>
      <li>yeah, a good way to get decent color without the face</li>
      <li>A bit too light for being brown.  </li>
      <li>Just try to clean up before you&#x27;re done applying the henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
      <li>: The full color from henna doesn&#x27;t come out for about 24 hours.</li>
      <li>So it may look light in color at first</li>
      <li>Dark scruff is attractive.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve completely switched to henna products and they mostly work</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t even worth returning.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a purple (indigo) based color which tends to show up in natural light, more so when it fades a bit too much (kinda like a \\&quot;blue\\&quot; dog/animal coat</li>
      <li>/&gt;It gives a natural touch to beard.&lt;br /&gt;good and safe product.</li>
      <li>I can apply the powder-water mix right away and after 2 hours on my hair I can rinse it.</li>
      <li>Tried a couple more times and tried with a second product that was suppose to be better for sensitive skin, but I still had a reaction.  </li>
      <li>However, some users whose hair absorbs more of the blue/purple color from the Indigo may want to delay 10 - 30 minutes before applying the paste as this will reduce the intensity of the Indigo (blue/purple), and increase the effect of the henna (red color), for a more natural color.</li>
      <li>chemicals\\&quot; or just \\&quot;no harsh chemicals\\&quot; as some reviewers have correctly stated, but many people will be much more assured by \\&quot;chemical free\\&quot; and those who know better know what they mean.</li>
      <li>) Rinse the bucket and toothbrush with hot water.  </li>
      <li>I only used it on my beard and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a lot more time than national brand chemical products...</li>
      <li>/&gt;This was my first time using hair henna</li>
      <li>Once mixed into a paste, most people should apply immediately.</li>
      <li>I had purchased this item over a year ago for the first time.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re just a gimmick to make soaps and shampoos lather up more, which isn&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
      <li>they&#x27;re just a gimmick to make soaps and shampoos lather up more, which isn&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
      <li>I spent a year gray and kind of depressed about it.  </li>
      <li>The color is good, but I had to stop shampooing my hair every day like I used to do, otherwise the color would vanish after a few days.</li>
      <li>The first application (1st day/90 min) didn&#x27;t do a whole lot</li>
      <li>some more now that I know they won&#x27;t have to be grey.  </li>
      <li>no need to watch and makesure it doesn&#x27;t get too dark like with JFM or the Clairol brew, and this stuff doesn&#x27;t try to melt your face off, which is kinda nice.</li>
      <li>Very easy to rinse also, not like the other henna&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Cant anyone out there invent a formula that will darken a mans beard in about 3 or 4 hours because that would be OK and men would buy it all day long if it didn&#x27;t burn your face off!</li>
      <li>It covered his grey nicely, looks natural.</li>
      <li>(I found Henna King after I developed an allergy to JFM like many others, but first I tried the Clairol spooge and chemically fried my face a second time ...</li>
      <li>You just mix the powder with a little warm water and rub the paste in by hand.  </li>
      <li>these last a little longer, more like 5 to 7 days at the most.</li>
      <li>but after a couple of days, matches my hair color very well.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Very dissappointed</li>
      <li>(Thanks DC!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think it has much effect on the beard coloring itself.</li>
      <li>I got this for my husband,  worked very well.  </li>
      <li>(note, you don&#x27;t have to stand there and stare at it in the mirror the whole time</li>
      <li>This does take longer but it works for me well, does not stain my skin as much</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t bother using gloves, because this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to stain skin, if it&#x27;s washed off in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
      <li>2) Avoid the use of the shower cap, which would bring the skin of your head to sweat more and the henna would stay wet.</li>
      <li>We were skeptical at first because it sounded too good to be true.  </li>
      <li>I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castille soap, which is a liquid that comes in a big bottle and is pretty easy to find (they sell it at my local Kroger grocery store).  </li>

      <li>skin will thank you ... and you get decent coloring that doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>To have the color last as long as possible, switch to a sulfate-free soap and shampoo, as sulfates tend to wash out henna more quickly.  </li>
      <li>To have the color last as long as possible, switch to a sulfate-free soap and shampoo, as sulfates tend to wash out henna more quickly.  </li>
      <li>It takes a few tries to establish the best timing for the most natural color, and even then it is a bit dark for the first few days.</li>
      <li>So I was understandably skeptical over this product, but turns out to work great.  </li>
      <li>I would imagine that is normal.</li>
      <li>Wish someone would invent a beard/mousthase dye that colors quickly but will not burn sensitive facial skin!</li>
      <li>STRONGLY (users of Medium Brown to Black Colors):</li>
      <li>At first I left product on for 30 mins.  </li>
      <li>If you wish to wait, be sure to stir every few minutes, adding water so the paste does not dry out.</li>
      <li>beard is almost entirely white (just got a little funky Deion Sanders &#x27;14 Pro Bowl kinda color in my moustache/goatee area), so dudes who&#x27;ve got more color going on may not need three coats to get it there.</li>
      <li>Your hair remains soft, not brittle.  </li>
      <li>After I became suddenly very allergic to Just for Men (and all the female permanent products)</li>
      <li>chose this over the Just for Men products because these are natural and not tested on animals.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was getting the salt-and-pepper look through my beard and sideburns.  Read a lot of reports from people who had skin problems (rashes, etc) after trying the usual chemical-filled products available at the store.  I have sensitive skin so figured I&#x27;d look for an alternative, and came across henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works!  Looks a bit dark at first but after a couple of days, matches my hair color very well.  After some trial-and-error, I figured out the best way to use it and thought I&#x27;d pass along some tips to you in case you&#x27;re considering using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Get yourself a small plastic bucket and a toothbrush.  Put maybe a couple of tablespoons of the henna in the bucket, and mix in a SMALL amount of hot water.  Mix it up.  The instructions say it should be the consistency of toothpaste, but I find that&#x27;s a bit too thick.  Just gradually add very small amounts of hot water, mixing along the way, until it&#x27;s slightly thinner than toothpaste consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The instructions say &amp;#34;henna will stain everything it touches&amp;#34; and advises using the enclosed plastic gloves.  Don&#x27;t bother.  They&#x27;ll only aggravate you as you apply it.  Henna might stain things if left on them for a long time, but I find that if you just wipe away any henna that lands in places it shouldn&#x27;t be with a wet tissue, it comes right up and doesn&#x27;t leave a stain.  That includes bathroom fixtures, your skin, etc.  Just try to clean up before you&#x27;re done applying the henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  Get a glob of henna out of the bucket onto the toothbrush, and run the toothbrush through your beard/hair.  Try to get the henna down through your hair, not just on surface level.  If the henna isn&#x27;t too thin, it won&#x27;t run out of your hair and over your skin ... it stays in place well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Rinse the bucket and toothbrush with hot water.  The toothbrush will eventually get stained, but you&#x27;re not going to use it for anything else, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Let sit for an hour, then rinse off.  Don&#x27;t use soap, just rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) To have the color last as long as possible, switch to a sulfate-free soap and shampoo, as sulfates tend to wash out henna more quickly.  Sulfates aren&#x27;t good for your skin, anyway ... they&#x27;re just a gimmick to make soaps and shampoos lather up more, which isn&#x27;t necessary.

    <li> It didn&#x27;t work....total waste of $$$ for this garbage!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this item over a year ago for the first time. Loved it then and love it now!!! I use it for my mustache and sideburns and it works great. It leaves some hairs lighter in color; making the &amp;#34;dye job&amp;#34; look natural. It also, does not burn or have chemicals so its totally safe to use. It does however, lose its potency closer to the end of package but, for a natural dye  I would imagine that is normal. After all I did have it around for about a year until I noticed it was not doing the job as before so, I purchased more and here I am, writing a rave review on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I discovered this product!!</li>
    <li> Product does not work. Left on over 1-1/2 hours and after washing off NO difference. Who has time to mess with this anyway? I have been using a more expensive product, Beardye, that is premixed. MUCH better product. No hassles with mixing. Dries in minutes with hair dryer. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. I just threw my unused portion away as not worth hassle of trying to return. Guess you get what you pay for....</li>
    <li> This does take longer but it works for me well, does not stain my skin as much and I don&#x27;t feel s***ty after I use it like I do with the synthetic crap.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to darken my beard.  I used to use Just For Men but I suddenly became allergic to it so I looked for something to replace it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I go the Manly Guy product, I read the instructions and it said I had to leave it on for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Who has the time for that?!  I have to dye my beard every few days because it grows so fast.  Ridiculous.  It wasn&#x27;t even worth returning.</li>
    <li> This product simply did not work. Left it on for the long time it requires only to see nothing happen. After seeing reviews, I guess it&#x27;s a risk.</li>
    <li> This product works well. It is the only color for my bread that I can use without a reaction. I used Just for Men for years without a problem then one day I just development a nasty reaction. Tried a couple more times and tried with a second product that was suppose to be better for sensitive skin, but I still had a reaction.  I&#x27;ve completely switched to henna products and they mostly work but you have to follow the directions as given.  The only con is the time. With Just for Men, the entire process only took around 10 minutes and I was ready to step outside immediately afterwards. I have to leave the henna product on at least a hour and a half for my beard. Time varies by the nature of your hair.  Plus its as a slight greenish tint immediately afterwards but it fades within a hour or so. However, this means that I have to take the time in plan.  No more dying my bread just before I go out to dinner or before work in the morning.</li>
    <li> This does not work. I followed the instructions carefully and did not see any results whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Worked but no matter how I adjusted steps goatee turned out green for at least 1 1/2 days. My grey also seems to be stubborn as it did not all turn  brown . I was going for salt and pepper look but it would be nice to know I could get full coverage. I also experienced mild burnings sensitivity but no sores like just for men so my skin just must be more sensitive. Otherwise worked. Wish it didn&#x27;t take as long and was easier to keep wet. Hair bonnet useless for goatee (shave my head bald). Thanks</li>
    <li> Mustache turned green with dye and stayed green.</li>
    <li> I have very short white hair and beard and was using &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; for at least 5 years before my skin started getting allergic reactions to it, so I needed to look for more natural products. I tried first &amp;#34;The Henna Guys Dark Brown&amp;#34; and I only got read hair with that product. Then I changed to Manly Guy and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I can apply the powder-water mix right away and after 2 hours on my hair I can rinse it. The color is good, but I had to stop shampooing my hair every day like I used to do, otherwise the color would vanish after a few days. Here are 2 suggestions from my experience: 1) Use a hair dryer after you put the mix on your hair. The henna works when it&#x27;s dry. This will reduce the procedure time. 2) Avoid the use of the shower cap, which would bring the skin of your head to sweat more and the henna would stay wet.</li>
    <li> This color is ok.  A bit too light for being brown.  Takes a long time to color the beard close to the color I want.  I used Just for men beard color and wanted to switch to a process that had less chemicals.  Might try the black next time.</li>
    <li> I left it in for an hour and a half. My hair naturally has blond highlights during the summer and this allows me to still get those from the summer sun. I&#x27;m 31 and only had three grey hairs but that was enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using hair henna and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!! I have used skin henna before for festivals and things so I had some experience. It works great! I still have some natural brown showing and my skin wasn&#x27;t stained at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think any longer than an hour and half and it would be too dark&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER: The full color from henna doesn&#x27;t come out for about 24 hours. So it may look light in color at first but the next day it will be completely colored. DO NOT DOUBLE THE USAGE IF YOU DONT SEE DESIRED COLOR RIGHT AWAY!!! Wait a day then decide.</li>
    <li> product was smelly and very difficult to use plus you have to leave it on for over an hour and a half</li>
    <li> Very good product. Must be left in quite long to work properly.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this over the Just for Men products because these are natural and not tested on animals. Just for Men are apparently not cruelty-free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become allergic to &amp;#34;Just For . . . &amp;#34; so I tried this.  I&#x27;ve used it on a grey patch on my bangs and on a 4-day-old beard stubble that made me look homeless.  This stuff worked beautifully on my dark brown hair, with no allergic reaction at all.  The color was a perfect blend.  And it&#x27;s simple to apply.  You just mix the powder with a little warm water and rub the paste in by hand.  I don&#x27;t bother using gloves, because this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to stain skin, if it&#x27;s washed off in a reasonable amount of time.  I look forward to growing out my hair and beard some more now that I know they won&#x27;t have to be grey.  I&#x27;m 48, and I&#x27;m not ready to look like Moses.</li>
    <li> I chose this dye because it&#x27;s all natural and I&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t create a rash under my mustache; that it&#x27;s what&#x27;s happened in the past with other colorants. It&#x27;s early for me to say it the above mentioned problem will occur or not.</li>
    <li> EDIT:  Recently I have had a couple of packets that didn&#x27;t work well.    After I became suddenly very allergic to Just for Men (and all the female permanent products) I spent a year gray and kind of depressed about it.  Dark scruff is attractive.  Grey scruff just looks old and tired.  I tried various Henna-based products from Whole Foods that didn&#x27;t work at all and left me so blotchy I had to shave it all off before I could even leave the house.    So I was understandably skeptical over this product, but turns out to work great.  The outcome is as good as Just for Men.  Instant 10 years off my face again!  The only negative is the long time you have to leave it on, but that is worth it for me just no to break out in hives for a week as I did with the permanent dyes.</li>
    <li> Works great,just need a discount cause I order every month</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband,  worked very well.  Very easy to apply.  It covered his grey nicely, looks natural.</li>
    <li> This product simply did not work. Left it on for the long time it requires only to see nothing happen</li>
    <li> Although Dark Brown is closer to my natural color and looks more natural with some stray blonde, grey and red hair that is natural for me, it does not cover the white hairs as well as the Darkest Brown. I would stay with this except that, even though there are directions on how to use on body hair, this one gave me a chest and abdominal rash that lasted a week both times I used it (a month apart). I did not have that problem with the Darkest Brown even after several applications within 1 month.</li>
    <li> Was not aware you had to leave the product on for 1.5 to 3 hours! Even after leaving it on that long there was only minimal covering of the gray. Very dissappointed</li>
    <li> I only used it on my beard and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a lot more time than national brand chemical products... BUT it works!&lt;br /&gt;You also don&#x27;t get the red blistering bumps that the chemical stuff started giving me after a few years of use.  Your hair remains soft, not brittle.  It actually seems to condition (soften) the whiskers a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 2 or 3 tries to get the results that I wanted.  One trick is to keep it moist while it&#x27;s on.  I&#x27;ve used a humidifier to dampen it every 15 min or so. You can also just use a mixture (just a little thinner) to pat on in order to re-moisten &amp;#34;the pack&amp;#34;.  And be advised, it is a mud pack on your face.  I&#x27;ve been leaving it on for 2 hours at a time, 2 to 3 times a week at this point.  Could be that once or twice a week might work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, use it hours before going out, because for  few hours after the treatment I notice a bit of a greenish hue.  You can try washing it, but the directions discourage that for 12 hours (at least for regular hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very Green Spinach-ee odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless something that takes less time (&amp; effort), but is still this gentle on my face, comes along ... I&#x27;ll be using this stuff.</li>
    <li> Much better than other heavy chemical haircolor - over the counter products.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will thank you ... and you get decent coloring that doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Takes forever to darken beard have to put it on multiple times and leave in over night for minimal change in color! Wish someone would invent a beard/mousthase dye that colors quickly but will not burn sensitive facial skin! That is why Just for Men is getting sued and lost 60%+ of the market because their product burns you skin in like 2 minutes! Cant anyone out there invent a formula that will darken a mans beard in about 3 or 4 hours because that would be OK and men would buy it all day long if it didn&#x27;t burn your face off!</li>
    <li> Excellent, thank you!</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Finally I can darken my hair without getting a rash (Just for Men is not for me).</li>
    <li> It works if you follow the directions, it does smell VERY strong and your head will smell for a week or so.  The color lasts and fades nicely.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It is all natural and has no chemicals that will burn you. I will definitely reorder it.</li>
    <li> I tried it &amp; followed the instructions to the letter &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to not have the chemicals like Just for Men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Works about the same as Just for Men - you&#x27;ll still have grays that don&#x27;t get caught.&lt;br /&gt;- Takes a HOUR to leave on your face and you can&#x27;t leave the house with it on.&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves black stains on your skin just like Just for Men.&lt;br /&gt;- This will still irritate your face like Just for Men (might be worse).&lt;br /&gt;- Messy to apply (like putting mud all over your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the biggest problem with this product is it works &amp;#34;so so&amp;#34; and you have to leave it on your face an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to buy it, get a shade lighter than what you want because the dark brown I got is pretty much black.  I will probably buy this product again and I would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t take a hour to apply, covered 100% and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (and my skin does not get irritated).  If you don&#x27;t mind the chemical factor Just for Men is a better product, I just hate the idea of chemicals on my face.</li>
    <li> Very good and the best thing is made of natural products.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a natural touch to beard.&lt;br /&gt;good and safe product.</li>
    <li> wish it lasted longer-- 2 weeks maybe...</li>
    <li> this type of dye did not last more than 3 days, not good for long use. my beard is rough type, could be reason. I hate to go back to commercial dyes. these last a little longer, more like 5 to 7 days at the most.</li>
    <li> like other reviewers I&#x27;ve used JFM for 10 years with no problems then suddenly it began burning me with awful sores. This Manly Guy stuff is a miracle alternative. No irritation and the color is perfect. I have very dark brown hair and used touch of gray to make my short gray beard get a salt and pepper look,not shoe polish dark. A teaspoon of this stuff for 40 minutes comes out perfect for me and actually lasts longer than JFM. Perfect replacement!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who had issues with JFM.  What an amazing product !!!!!!!!  We were skeptical at first because it sounded too good to be true.  It worked perfectly.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I purchased for beard color as it was advertised.  At first I left product on for 30 mins.  It didn&#x27;t work.  Next time I left it on for 45 minutes, same result.  Then I tried leaving it on for an hour.  No dice.  The product claims that since it has no chemicals, users should allow more time for it to work.  So I try again, leaving the product on my face for 2 hours, and NOTHING!  Now I am just 100% frustrated.</li>
    <li> Note that \\&quot;chemical free\\&quot; &#x3D; non-physical/incorporeal though. If there&#x27;s physical substance, it&#x27;s chemical, period. But I understand why Henna King uses that phrase. They may really mean \\&quot;no inorganic chemicals\\&quot; or just \\&quot;no harsh chemicals\\&quot; as some reviewers have correctly stated, but many people will be much more assured by \\&quot;chemical free\\&quot; and those who know better know what they mean. I just hate to see that kind of error unaddressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, on with the review of the actual product. (I&#x27;ll give the advertising 2.5 unofficial stars. Yeah, I know ... whatever.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited for a three day weekend to give this stuff a try. The first application (1st day/90 min) didn&#x27;t do a whole lot but it did add a little bit of color in the middle (like a little pink left in an overdone steak), the second application (2nd day/120 min) looked fairly decent and evened it out a good bit, but the third (3rd day/90min) got it squared away (note, you don&#x27;t have to stand there and stare at it in the mirror the whole time--it&#x27;s not going anywhere and it still works if you read or nap or even surf the Interweb). I&#x27;ve found that since then--since I laid down a good base coat--I only need 15-20 minute touch ups about every 4-6 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is almost entirely white (just got a little funky Deion Sanders &#x27;14 Pro Bowl kinda color in my moustache/goatee area), so dudes who&#x27;ve got more color going on may not need three coats to get it there. I keep it somewhere between 1/8\\&quot;-1/4\\&quot; long (I use an extended 1/2 trimmer guide comb on it every week), and I expect this stuff lasts longer in longer beards. I&#x27;d also guess they probably show less variation. The whiteness of the beard (nod to Herman Melville), it seems to me, would exaggerate that effect. So of course those are factors to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s forgiving so you don&#x27;t need to be very careful about the time. If you keep in on for five or ten minutes longer than needed it&#x27;s no big deal--no need to watch and makesure it doesn&#x27;t get too dark like with JFM or the Clairol brew, and this stuff doesn&#x27;t try to melt your face off, which is kinda nice. (I found Henna King after I developed an allergy to JFM like many others, but first I tried the Clairol spooge and chemically fried my face a second time ... awesome!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a purple (indigo) based color which tends to show up in natural light, more so when it fades a bit too much (kinda like a \\&quot;blue\\&quot; dog/animal coat but with a distinct dark purple hue). It amuses me, but that response probably isn&#x27;t normal--at least not for the beard owner. Word is that adding some of the medium brown (red based) to the dark brown mitigates that (and vice-versa). We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend following D. Clark&#x27;s tips--the review from 29 JUN 13. (Thanks DC!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the stuff needs to be applied so it&#x27;s a fairly thick and even dark green all over--no lighter patches, and take particular note of the edges. It -does- darken over several hours (significantly but not dramatically), and it doesn&#x27;t stain the skin ... or at least it hasn&#x27;t yet. Allegedly it simply doesn&#x27;t work for some people, but at least some of those probably just did it wrong (and if I&#x27;d only given it one application and given up I&#x27;d&#x27;ve thought the same thing). Contrary to DC&#x27;s tips, I prefer to wash it off my face--it gets the color off of the skin and I don&#x27;t think it has much effect on the beard coloring itself. You get used to the way it smells when it&#x27;s wet--it&#x27;s not really a bad smell, just not real pleasant either ... but you do get used to it (and I&#x27;ve got an over-sensitive schnoz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yeah, a good way to get decent color without the face meltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, there it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -- addendum --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just found this re: the blue/purple issue on their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application Delay: ONLY FOR HAIR THAT ABSORBS INDIGO STRONGLY (users of Medium Brown to Black Colors): Once mixed into a paste, most people should apply immediately. However, some users whose hair absorbs more of the blue/purple color from the Indigo may want to delay 10 - 30 minutes before applying the paste as this will reduce the intensity of the Indigo (blue/purple), and increase the effect of the henna (red color), for a more natural color. This is only necessary if you find that your hair grabs blue/purple. If you wish to wait, be sure to stir every few minutes, adding water so the paste does not dry out. Waiting increases red tones and decreases any Indigo blue &amp; purple tones, if present at all.</li>
    <li> This product is actually comically bad. I hate to be so hard on a product which is probably made by a small business, but it takes forever to use and doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> LADIES!  I love this hair color, been dying my hair for over 20 years. This actually dyes my hair dark brown not orange. Very easy, I clean the house while iit&#x27;s in my hair. Maybe 2 hours. Love love love this. Very easy to rinse also, not like the other henna&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for a friend&#x27;s birthday: he has a white mustache and darker natural hair. The product was advertised as having no chemicals yet when he tested it on his wrist he reported an allergic reaction. It might work for you but it did not for him.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> It takes a few tries to establish the best timing for the most natural color, and even then it is a bit dark for the first few days. Also, the smell is a bit strong. But the product works well on my beard and eyebrows, without the burns I experienced with the chemical products sold in stores.</li>
