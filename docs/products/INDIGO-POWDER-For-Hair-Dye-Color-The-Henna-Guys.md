      <li>Update: new purchase results from July 22, 2015:</li>
      <li>, I henned first (only adding water)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Worked well for me. However, very very stinky, grainy &amp; not ground up fine enough, imo. I will try it again from elsewhere &amp; see which is better.</li>
    <li> The Henna is not working for gray hair. Used this product 4 times. My bathtub and curtains were blue, but my hair was grey after 4, 8, 10 hours.  I don&#x27;t recommend for gray hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this indigo to mix with henna and amla to dye my hair. This was a fresh 2013 batch and I could definitely tell! My hair went a little darker than it normally does because of how fresh it is. I did not complete a strand test prior to buying, which would have let me know the strength of this indigo. My hair still turned out shiny and healthy and 1 month post dying has lightened up.</li>
    <li> I purchased this awhile ago, so it&#x27;s possible I had a bad batch?  But in my online searches, I&#x27;ve learned a lot.  I have learned that:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is hard to cover grey hair with indigo.  There&#x27;s tips to help, like adding salt, but it&#x27;s hard to do.&lt;br /&gt;2.  There&#x27;s a lot of bad and adulterated products out there.  There&#x27;s simple tests you can do to test the quality of the indigo.&lt;br /&gt;3.  A lot of the problems I&#x27;ve read from people, they&#x27;re not mixing up the products correctly, and a lot of companies have bad directions.  You have to give henna/indigo time for the dye release.  Especially henna.  Henna can take hours for dye release, not 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Do your research.  Look for recommendations from others on good products and reputable companies.  They&#x27;re out there, just have to really dig and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a paper towel test with your indigo.  Make some up, and put a dab of it on a paper towel.  You do NOT want to see a ring of blue going out from the indigo on the paper towel.  It&#x27;s my understanding that this is just dyes added to give it color.  You can search that online for an exact answer yourself.  I&#x27;ve used this indigo here and it would color/cover my greys, but within a week it completely rinses out, and the greys are showing.  I&#x27;ve recently purchased some indigo from another source, paid quite a bit more money for it, and it does not show this blue ring/dye leeching out from the product on the paper towel.  The color did not run out of my hair, and my greys are not showing through until my roots grow in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing the Henna/Indigo two step process for several years now and have tried many different Indigos. This one is, by far, superior. One hour and I get a deep, rich color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various brands of indigo in order to darken my naturally brown hair and none of them compare to The Henna Guys. The longevity of the color and the deep beautiful blue/black is wonderful. I did the two step process of 3 hours of henna and then 3 hours of indigo and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. Thanks Henna Guys!</li>
    <li> This is the first indigo I have ever used, and it is wonderful. It mixes up very smooth, is easy to use, and creates a wonderful color when mixed with henna.</li>
    <li> I have been using henna for hair dye for almost 4 years now, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve been truly disappointed. Not only has my hair not stopped bleeding blue (awful!) but it was nothing like other henna I&#x27;ve used in the application, it bled the entire time I was applying. Do not purchase this item!</li>
    <li> Nice powder, mixes well. Really works when you use henna first.  I will keep ordering from this company.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but this indigo is of such poor quality, I felt compelled to comment. Firstly, the only reason I ordered here is because my usual place (Henna Sooq) was out of indigo. How unfortunate for me. I have now used this indigo TWICE. This indigo did NOT darken the henna colored hair as it was supposed to. I do a two step process (henna first followed by indigo) and I always get a very rich dark brown color when using the indigo from Henna Sooq. The Henna Guys indigo still left me w/ orangey red roots, BOTH times. The first time I left it on for 2 hours (my usual time) and the second time, I did FOUR hours and STILL the same problem! Very disappointed. What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The expiration date says 2017 and pkg date August 2013.</li>
    <li> I use henna regularly and using indigo was the only way to dye my hair black. It worked great and only had very gradual color fade.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, easy to use, perfect coloring.</li>
    <li> First time using henna. Love the color. Will purchase again in future.</li>
    <li> High quality -- makes a very fine paste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed by this item. My mother and I ordered this product to cover our white hairs. Im in my late 20s, have a few white hairs and have been using regular henna for years which leaves a red tint. My mom has been using hair color and henna for decades and we wanted to give this product a shot since we&#x27;d heard great things about it from a relative. We&#x27;re thoroughly disappointed. I have years of experience of applying henna, read the instructions for this product very carefully, left he products in my hair for nearly 14 hrs, re-applied this product at least on 3 separate occasions and am completely unimpressed by the results. My whites did not become black, but rather will left as this cloudy light gray. The multiple applications that i&#x27;ve tried for this products was in order to ensure an application mistakes from my end. Either I received a faulty bag/single item/products OR this indigo powder does not work!</li>
    <li> I COULD TELL FROM THE AROMA THAT THIS HENNA WAS FRESH!  I TRIED A TEST ON A SMALL PATCH AND THE COLOR WAS SMASHING!  I AM WAITING FOR A QUIET WEEKEND TO USE IT,  I HAVE BEEN SO BUSY, BUT HAVE THE PACKAGE PARKED IN A PLACE WHERE I SEE IT AS I PASS BY, AND I CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO SEE THE RESULTS!</li>
    <li> All Natural and works very well. Should be mixed with henna.</li>
    <li> Update: August, 20, 2015. My scalp is still itching like crazy. I resorted to making a very strong sulfur, menthol and camphor oil mix to put on my scalp to help control the itching. This indigo is no good. I don&#x27;t not recommend this pursuit to anyone, not even my worse enemy. Update: new purchase results from July 22, 2015: I have been using a 2 step, henna &amp; indigo treatment on my hair for about a year &amp; 1/2 now. In the last year &amp; 1/2 I&#x27;ve performed these treatments on my hair 5 times. I never had an allergic reaction before, I am aware that an allergic reaction can occur at anytime and repeated use can have a cumulative type affect. I did my usual process on 7/22/15, I henned first (only adding water) then I indigo-ed (only adding water). This time around I got the worst allergic reaction in my life out of every reaction I have ever had. It felt as if I had lice, my scalp was itchy, crawly, creepy and on fire. I do not know what was in this batch of &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34; Indigo, or how old this batch was or how it was harvested and processed. Let me tell you, I will never ever ever use indigo again. I scratched and am still scratching sores in my scalp and patches of hair is coming along with it. I&#x27;ve spent about $200 now trying to relieve the itching, burning, unbearable pain. I&#x27;ve tried apple cider vinegar with the mother, which hazel, sea breeze, sulfur 8, 10% sulfur butter, 2 bottles of shampoo, about 8 bottles of conditioner, coconut oil, castor oil, flax seed gel, marshmallow root, slippery elm root, washing my hair daily and prayer... You name it, I used my money and tried it with little to no relief. My head is still crawling and itching as I type. My hair color came out beautiful, it faded tremendously due to all the vigorous washing. I will say no to INDIGO. If my package was not opened I would request a refund. I can&#x27;t not stand this itching.  Say No to Indigo  Old review from June 2014: Delivery of my package was very speedy to my Philadelphia home. I havenaturally dark brown curly hair that&#x27;s about 18 inches when fully air dried and about bra strap length when lightly flat ironed (I&#x27;m 6 foot). I did the 2 step henna process to get jet black hair. I used Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, for my henna portion, left that on for 4 hours then rinsed. Then I applied the indigo mix, appx 300 grams and left that on for three hours, rinsed with warm water and then washed with Conditioner, NOT SHAMPOO. I did an overnight conditioning process and rinsed that out appx 10 hours later and styled as usual. My hair came out gorgeous, this was my first henna and indigo treatment ever. My hair was not dry at all after my overnight conditioning session, I actually can not wait til my next treatment. Just one tip, this product is cheaper directly on hennaguys.com with free shipping to the US.</li>
    <li> No matter how well and how many times I rinse my hair, I keep getting black residue coming out (in my hairbrush, on my pillow, etc.). It isn&#x27;t so noticeable that I wish to return the product, but I probably won&#x27;t order this again. My henna powder nicely colors my hair and does not leave residue after it has been rinsed out.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, and quick shipping.  We will go back again when need it again.</li>
