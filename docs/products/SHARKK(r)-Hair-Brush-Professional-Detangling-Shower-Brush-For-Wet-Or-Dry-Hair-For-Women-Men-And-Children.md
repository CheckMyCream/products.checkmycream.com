      <li>We love the brush!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>This brush is really amazing.</li>
      <li>Now she is brushing her own hair without being reminded.</li>
      <li>hair!&amp;#34;  :-)</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t at all, and if anything, her hair is shinier and more silky than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I need more than that.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the seller, because my product arrived on the estimated delivery date.</li>
      <li>Picking up two more for my daughters.</li>
      <li>I have been able to brush through  my daughters hair with no tears.</li>
      <li>compared to most of the others out there...</li>
      <li>Most brushes pull and this one never does.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for detangling.</li>
      <li>Best with long hair.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly with wet hair.</li>
      <li>Nice brush; exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>You can easily see it&#x27;s made from cheap materials.</li>
      <li>What had been a huge, tear-inducing chore for my daughter, has now become a breeze.</li>
      <li>It goes evenly and smoothly through my hair - every time.  </li>
      <li>I actually liked her so much</li>
      <li>It is light weight and the color is as pictured.  </li>
      <li>I have waist length hair and the brush worked great just like another brand but lesser cost.</li>
      <li>It really does take most of the pain away.</li>
      <li>I end up using my $2 drug store cheapie since I feel like the teeth really grab my hair better.</li>
      <li>This brush might be better for those that don&#x27;t have as much hair to deal with as I do.</li>
      <li>Feels good on the scalp, but doesn&#x27;t actually get through tangles</li>
      <li>daughter&#x27;s hair is very long and fine, she has a lot of it and it tangles very easily.</li>
      <li>I have fairly wavy, curly hair that sticks out (not quite as far as) Roseanne Roseannadanna when it&#x27;s really humid and brushed out.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure with short (collar-length) hair</li>
      <li>Received the brush  yesterday and tried for the first time today.</li>
      <li>She even said its superior to s much more expensive one she got from the salon.</li>
      <li>This is a very soft brush, so it may be good for younger kids or for people particularly sensitive to pain when tugging or pulling knotted hair.  </li>
      <li>My 9 year old daughter has very fine, but thick hair that tangles very easily into knots.  </li>
      <li>My husband who has long hair as well has requested that I buy more of the brushes for his band show bag and his car.  </li>
      <li>So gentle on my hair and keeps it from frizzing out.  </li>
      <li>Maybe not quite so much, but still my hair breaks.</li>
      <li>This brush really hurts my head and my 3 girls head-</li>
      <li>Gently brushes hair, removing tangles.</li>
      <li>Thinking that this brush would pull out so much of my hair...</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I guess you could describe that as a gentle touch.</li>
      <li>I love that this one has a sturdy handle (our other brush had no handle) and does not seem to  hurt when she brushes.</li>
      <li>After showering, it only takes a minute of two of quick brushing with the Sharkk and her hair is smooth, tangle-free and without a single tear!</li>
      <li>This brush is an amazing detangler, through wet and dry hair!</li>
      <li>Also, my product arrived in new condition, was undamaged and did not have a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this brush GENTLY detangles my hair like no other brush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>It works really well in the shower when our hair is wet with conditioner.  </li>
      <li>She was excited by the flower design and newness and let me brush her hair when we got it; without complaint.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this brush to anyone, especially for kids who are sensitive to brushing.</li>
      <li>Having tried several other brush I was doubtful that just a different style of brush would make such a huge difference in brushing her hair, but it does and we are thrilled with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> She would brush with other styles of brushes and it would only make the snarls worse until I would have to step in and finish it....causing more tears.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for long, think hair or curly hair...</li>
<li> the bristles are not soft at all.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use it wet only dry.</li>
<li> What I mean is, when there are no tangles, and I try to run the brush through my hair, it seems like it doesn&#x27;t really grab the hair.</li>
<li> I would recommend this brush if you have normal to thick hair.</li>
<li> but wet or dry</li>
<li> /&gt;After researching brushes, that could be used, to detangle wet or dry hair, I decided to order this one.</li>
<li> Kids seem to be complaining a lot less with this brush used to do their daily brushing.</li>
<li> #34;Mom, we need to use this one, it&#x27;s for wet AND dry</li>
<li> The previous brushes I had basically brushed out a wig with the amount of hair I lost.</li>
<li> Not only does it de-tangle like no one&#x27;s business, but I would lose little to no hair with each stroke.</li>
<li> I really wanted this product to work for me; however, I had to return it, because it did not seem to brush through my very thick, Afro hair.</li>
<li> I was also concerned that brushing while wet</li>
<li> Will not recommend wet brush</li>
<li> It was a lot slimier that I expected</li>
<li> It does not pull my long, slightly curly hair.  </li>
<li> The flimsy bristles wouldn&#x27;t brush through my wet (or dry) thick and coarse hair so returned for a refund.</li>
<li> We were at the point of just cutting her hair short because the upkeep was too much.</li>
<li> The smell is terrible, but other than that works good.</li>
<li> My hair is long, brownish, and usually tangled</li>
<li> Less shedding and tangles.</li>
<li> The bristles are so weak, they would only skim the hair surface.</li>
<li> /&gt;We will be ordering another brush for her little sister who keeps asking to use it....</li>
<li> but this brush can get through it without any trouble.  </li>
<li> I like it as a back up brush or to take traveling cause if I lose it or leave it behind</li>
<li> I have wavy hair and am usually pulling through it when brushing... feeling as though I am loosing handfuls of hair at a time.  </li>
<li> My thick curly hair need something with substance to tame it.</li>
<li> At least the bristles aren&#x27;t falling out like the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> But, this brush might work on someone, whose hair is not as thick as mine.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have particularly thick hair (in fact, I would say my hair is on the thinner side) and</li>
<li> I have waist length, thick, wavy hair and</li>
<li> No more tears when brushing my girls hair!</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t be heart broken.</li>
<li> but it left my hair smelling horrible!</li>
<li> this brush is unable to make it through all the layers when I&#x27;m brushing my hair.  </li>

    <li> Excellent. Kids seem to be complaining a lot less with this brush used to do their daily brushing.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin so I wanted to get a brush that minimized the amount of hair I would brush out. The previous brushes I had basically brushed out a wig with the amount of hair I lost. When I tried this brush, I WAS BLOWN AWAY! Not only does it de-tangle like no one&#x27;s business, but I would lose little to no hair with each stroke. Will definitely be keep this brush!</li>
    <li> The flimsy bristles wouldn&#x27;t brush through my wet (or dry) thick and coarse hair so returned for a refund.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for two months and I love it.  It does not pull my long, slightly curly hair.  It goes evenly and smoothly through my hair - every time.  Most brushes pull and this one never does.  It is light weight and the color is as pictured.  My hair is long, brownish, and usually tangled but this brush can get through it without any trouble.  I know it is a cheap-in-price brush but I have been very happy with it.  I would recommend this brush if you have normal to thick hair.</li>
    <li> Thinking that this brush would pull out so much of my hair...compared to most of the others out there...still, it collects hair. Maybe not quite so much, but still my hair breaks. I have fairly wavy, curly hair that sticks out (not quite as far as) Roseanne Roseannadanna when it&#x27;s really humid and brushed out. Also, it&#x27;s wimpy. What I mean is, when there are no tangles, and I try to run the brush through my hair, it seems like it doesn&#x27;t really grab the hair. I guess you could describe that as a gentle touch. I need more than that. At least the bristles aren&#x27;t falling out like the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, back to the drawing board. This brush might be better for those that don&#x27;t have as much hair to deal with as I do. Not as damaged, but rather sleek hair.</li>
    <li> This brush has been life changing. It is GREAT!. I have been able to brush through  my daughters hair with no tears. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for.... Doesn&#x27;t work well for long, think hair or curly hair... Will not recommend wet brush</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the great reviews that customers wrote on Amazon.  Unfortunately, I just think it&#x27;s okay.  I don&#x27;t have particularly thick hair (in fact, I would say my hair is on the thinner side) and this brush is unable to make it through all the layers when I&#x27;m brushing my hair.  This is a very soft brush, so it may be good for younger kids or for people particularly sensitive to pain when tugging or pulling knotted hair.  For me, this was kinda of a disappointment.  I end up using my $2 drug store cheapie since I feel like the teeth really grab my hair better.</li>
    <li> we bought this brush in February, then bought it again in March so that we would have 2!  It works really well in the shower when our hair is wet with conditioner.  Gently brushes hair, removing tangles.</li>
    <li> This brush really hurts my head and my 3 girls head- the bristles are not soft at all.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly with wet hair. Best with long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a lot of differences between brushes... until this one.  It&#x27;s awesome!  I have wavy hair and am usually pulling through it when brushing... feeling as though I am loosing handfuls of hair at a time.  Not with this brush!  So gentle on my hair and keeps it from frizzing out.  Picking up two more for my daughters.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife who has hair like a lions mane. Works great with no issues. She even said its superior to s much more expensive one she got from the salon.</li>
    <li> I purchased a shark brush for my daughter because every day was a fight to brush her hair (even with a different detangling brush). She was excited by the flower design and newness and let me brush her hair when we got it; without complaint. Now she is brushing her own hair without being reminded. I love that this one has a sturdy handle (our other brush had no handle) and does not seem to  hurt when she brushes. I actually liked her so much I bought a second one for my bathroom.</li>
    <li> My 9 year old daughter has very fine, but thick hair that tangles very easily into knots.  This brush helped wonderfully with the tangles.  We no longer fight with her to brush her hair.  My husband who has long hair as well has requested that I buy more of the brushes for his band show bag and his car.  We are all very pleased with how this brush works with tangles.  It really does take most of the pain away.</li>
    <li> I received the brush last week. I LOVE IT! It was a lot slimier that I expected (I have a paddle brush that is about twice as thick).&lt;br /&gt;The brush work great, does not pull tangled hair, and works a LOT better than the Knot Genie detangling brush I bought months ago via Groupon. I would defiantly purchase again and hope to get one for my sister!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for detangling. You can easily see it&#x27;s made from cheap materials. My thick curly hair need something with substance to tame it. I like it as a back up brush or to take traveling cause if I lose it or leave it behind I won&#x27;t be heart broken.</li>
    <li> The smell is terrible, but other than that works good.</li>
    <li> We call this our Magic Brush! What had been a huge, tear-inducing chore for my daughter, has now become a breeze. We were at the point of just cutting her hair short because the upkeep was too much. Having tried several other brush I was doubtful that just a different style of brush would make such a huge difference in brushing her hair, but it does and we are thrilled with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s hair is very long and fine, she has a lot of it and it tangles very easily. She would brush with other styles of brushes and it would only make the snarls worse until I would have to step in and finish it....causing more tears. After showering, it only takes a minute of two of quick brushing with the Sharkk and her hair is smooth, tangle-free and without a single tear! I was also concerned that brushing while wet (something I&#x27;ve been told to never do) would cause damage to her hair. It hasn&#x27;t at all, and if anything, her hair is shinier and more silky than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be ordering another brush for her little sister who keeps asking to use it....she says, &amp;#34;Mom, we need to use this one, it&#x27;s for wet AND dry hair!&amp;#34;  :-)</li>
    <li> This brush is really amazing. I don&#x27;t use it wet only dry. Less shedding and tangles. I considered getting a denman brush but this is a cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> Nice brush; exactly as advertised.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review on the Sharkk Hair Brush. I am satisfied with the seller, because my product arrived on the estimated delivery date. Also, my product arrived in new condition, was undamaged and did not have a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching brushes, that could be used, to detangle wet or dry hair, I decided to order this one. I really wanted this product to work for me; however, I had to return it, because it did not seem to brush through my very thick, Afro hair. But, this brush might work on someone, whose hair is not as thick as mine.</li>
    <li> Smells awful! The brush smells like burned rubber. I tried to wash it and get the smell out but it left my hair smelling horrible!</li>
    <li> We love the brush! I don&#x27;t know how it doesn&#x27;t it but wet or dry it gets the tangles out of my girls hair with NO tears. We have already recommendeed this brush to friends.</li>
    <li> The bristles are so weak, they would only skim the hair surface. Then THEY MELTED next to a hairdryer&#x27;s heat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for just over a month now. This brush is an amazing detangler, through wet and dry hair! I have waist length, thick, wavy hair and this brush GENTLY detangles my hair like no other brush I&#x27;ve owned. Use caution when using it with a blow dryer. The heat, along with the pulling motion, warped the bristles a bit before I noticed and stopped. But, it still works great. I&#x27;m sure with short (collar-length) hair it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this brush to anyone, especially for kids who are sensitive to brushing.</li>
    <li> Received the brush  yesterday and tried for the first time today. I have waist length hair and the brush worked great just like another brand but lesser cost. So save your money and buy this one.</li>
    <li> Feels good on the scalp, but doesn&#x27;t actually get through tangles</li>
    <li> Works Great! No more tears when brushing my girls hair!</li>
