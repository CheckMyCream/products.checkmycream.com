      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>How glad I am that I did!  </li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re a redhead, this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Great for my light eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>I can see this being a bit warm for people with ashy toned hair</li>
      <li>I  always use primer to get the product to adhere nicely.  </li>
      <li>I own the benefit brow (both colors) and was running out</li>
      <li>It goes on really nice and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>This also fills in nicely where my brows are thinner.</li>
      <li>I like this one best because it has a shorter brush and is much easier to use and not get all over.</li>
      <li>color and it was perfect and natural.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how I could be more pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>The colour alaa is so lovely.</li>
      <li>Works great, states in place &amp; much easier to remove than Blink.</li>
      <li>I tinted them for many years.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I love this so much better than pencil.</li>
      <li>In my opinion it is even better than Lancome.  </li>
      <li>If they reversed the shape of the applicator, I think it would better get the product where I want it.  </li>
      <li>That would be natural looking, and this would be the ideal product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply, lasts all day, and isn&#x27;t a pain to get off.</li>
      <li>The brow mascara is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I find this brow mascara easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The light to medium is a good color for brien hair and very comparable to the light benefit brow.  </li>
      <li>I have tried all kinds of eyebrow products (and paid large amounts) and this is IT!!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous product.</li>
      <li>I also use a light colored pencil to help fill in where I don&#x27;t have any eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>Like it but too light for me.</li>
      <li>but I found it to be too light.</li>
      <li>However, the color I choose might be a bit too light.</li>
      <li>I thought it was fantastic and was so excited when I saw this.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything trying to reproduce the effect of the old Borghese product including pencils, gels and light brown mascara (I&#x27;m quite good at the last) but the mini-brush allows much better control than a mascara wand and the product has a better viscosity too.</li>
      <li>Cannot say enough good things.</li>
      <li>Nice and easy for that extra darkness on my graying brows.</li>
      <li>Found my last brow gel, this is wonderful for blonde brows.  </li>
      <li>I received it quickly and undamaged.  </li>
      <li>In general, I like the tinted brow &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34;s better than pencils, because they give a more natural look, and are even more brainless to apply.  </li>
      <li>This gives you a nice color natural looking for a blonde thickens up well, and dries nicely.  </li>
      <li>you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a real shame, because this is the easiest and fastest brow makeup I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
      <li>The perfect color of taupe, that always works (for almost everyone), could be described as a light brown, or dark beige, with some gray in it, that is not too red, and not too gold!</li>
      <li>My eyebrows are naturally full but super duper invisible due to being blonde so this is the perfect thing for me.</li>
      <li>Great brow gel that gives a little color.</li>
      <li>It goes on easy and quick &amp; I&#x27;m beginning to look normal again</li>
      <li>This one wins in my book.  </li>
      <li>I find it creates a more natural brow</li>
      <li>The color on L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s brow plumper is a very warm reddish brown, not attractive on most (brow color tends to be cooler than hair color).</li>
      <li>At 65 my eyebrows are nearly non-existent but this helps with what I do have, goes on easily and stays put all day.  </li>
      <li>Wish I had just shelled out an extra $15 for the product I love.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different ways of doing my brows.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking for a different product with a better applicator.</li>
      <li>I have since ordered it 2 more times (1 to use immediately, and 1 as a back up in case</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since my eyebrows are now pretty sparse -- and a lot of hairs with no pigment -- not exactly gray, but more off-white --</li>
      <li>I do several strokes to get a strong blonde color,  and it dries more natural than the others.  </li>
      <li>I noticed that they really looked washed out.  </li>
      <li>this color was almost blonde, way too light for my brow.</li>
      <li>This stuff is really scratchy going on and feels sticky until it dries; then I have awareness that my eyebrows feel &amp;#34;gelled&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>really well</li>
      <li>All of these require a few times to get used to how much to apply, make sure your strokes go the right way.  </li>
      <li>I really wish this came in a light, brownish grey color.</li>
      <li>I actually like it better than the Lancome products since that one was very cloudy and had a whipped or fluffy appearance whereas this one is more clear.  </li>
      <li>This L&#x27;Oreal product has a better (smaller) applicator and gives similar results.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This is completely gold, which is very unnatural looking.</li>
      <li>I had no idea that plucking out my unruly eyebrows as a teenager would result in having very sparse eyebrows as an old lady.  </li>
      <li>I found and used a product very similar to this by Lancome called &amp;#34;Mod√©le Sourcils Brow Expert&amp;#34; (sells for $25) for several years but after becoming a mother I just couldn&#x27;t justify the expense.  </li>
      <li>I have really thin eyebrows and it looks good, for all who are just looking for fuller even brows</li>
      <li>The light/medium is a nice color for blonde hair -- gives me brows, but isn&#x27;t harsh.</li>
      <li>It looks as good (except for the weird gold color) as anything else, and is much, much faster to apply.</li>
      <li>Once everything is on, I let it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; out a little and then lightly apply a coat of clear brow &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;tamer&amp;#34; to sort of seal the deal.</li>
      <li>If you like wearing wild, funky colors, then this is for</li>
      <li>Had been using Blink for nearly 3x the price of this product.  </li>
      <li>It works, but nowhere near as well or as comfortably/easily as Gimme Brow.  </li>
      <li>It looks natural, and stays all day.</li>
      <li>So much that I have only used once because I don&#x27;t want to be seen in public with Groucho Marx eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>The reviews on the color noted that it was a reddish hue which is not a problem for me because I am a redhead with blonde eyebrows, so this would be a natural color for me.  </li>
      <li>Starting with Smart Brow nice product but still looking, then tried Maybelline Brow Drama they call it that because your eyebrows look like your in a really bad old movie with painted on eyebrows.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was looking for an easier way to do my eyebrows and saw someone on my commuter train take out what looked similar to a mascara wand and do their eyebrows.  I thought it was fantastic and was so excited when I saw this.  The reviews on the color noted that it was a reddish hue which is not a problem for me because I am a redhead with blonde eyebrows, so this would be a natural color for me.  The color was great.  The biggest disappointment for me is how badly it applied.  I like a slightly thicker, natural style eyebrow and this made mine even bigger.  So much that I have only used once because I don&#x27;t want to be seen in public with Groucho Marx eyebrows.  I would use and buy this product if the wand was narrower to create a slimmer brow.  Until then, I&#x27;ll keep using my eyebrow pencil.</li>
    <li> Found my last brow gel, this is wonderful for blonde brows.  Cannot say enough good things.</li>
    <li> Great brow gel that gives a little color. Shapes and grooms brows into place. Great value! I like it.</li>
    <li> Best I have used that gives me great results.  Three times a charm I guess,  if your blonde this product is for you.  Starting with Smart Brow nice product but still looking, then tried Maybelline Brow Drama they call it that because your eyebrows look like your in a really bad old movie with painted on eyebrows.  All of these require a few times to get used to how much to apply, make sure your strokes go the right way.  I am blonde blue eye thinning eyebrows.  I  always use primer to get the product to adhere nicely.  This gives you a nice color natural looking for a blonde thickens up well, and dries nicely.  For all of you who use these, you know some that they can dry and your brows look not good.  I do several strokes to get a strong blonde color,  and it dries more natural than the others.  I am pleased with this. I received it quickly and undamaged.  I have really thin eyebrows and it looks good, for all who are just looking for fuller even brows, I bet it would look really good.</li>
    <li> I bought the blond even though I&#x27;m gray now.  The comments about it being gold are correct before it goes on but once on the gold turns to a light color which is perfect for me.  At 65 my eyebrows are nearly non-existent but this helps with what I do have, goes on easily and stays put all day.  I also use a light colored pencil to help fill in where I don&#x27;t have any eyebrows.  It goes on easy and quick &amp; I&#x27;m beginning to look normal again - YEA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried one other brow mascara but it really clumped and I was constantly cleaning up after it - not so with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s mascara.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers noted, it is gold on the brush but DOES NOT turn your brows gold.  It adds volume to my brows and keeps them in place without having to flatten them down with a wax pencil.  If you want the brow darker or longer over the eye use a pencil before applying this product.  For the price it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Great for my light eyebrows.  I have tried all kinds of eyebrow products (and paid large amounts) and this is IT!!! It goes on really nice and lasts all day. I have found the Holy Grail!!!!</li>
    <li> This brow plumper is quite remarkable.  In general, I like the tinted brow &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34;s better than pencils, because they give a more natural look, and are even more brainless to apply.  Before this I had been using Benefit&#x27;s Gimme Brow, which I must say is wonderful.  This L&#x27;Oreal product has a better (smaller) applicator and gives similar results.  The reason it beats the gimme brow is that it actually stays on ALL day.  I absolutely love that!  It is also much less expensive than the Benefit version.  This one wins in my book.  I have since ordered it 2 more times (1 to use immediately, and 1 as a back up in case they ever stop making it).</li>
    <li> Love this! And I can almost buy 3 of these for the price of one Benefit Gimme Brow, which I&#x27;d been relying on for the past 2 years. This is a great alternative. The light/medium is a nice color for blonde hair -- gives me brows, but isn&#x27;t harsh.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice eye brow product. I love this so much better than pencil. It looks natural, and stays all day.</li>
    <li> REALLY NICE - GREAT FOR LIGHTERBLONDE  BROWS AND LIGHTER BROWN BROWS</li>
    <li> I lost my Benefit Gimme Brow which I looove, and didn&#x27;t want to spend another ~$22 so I hoped this would work as a substitute.  This stuff is really scratchy going on and feels sticky until it dries; then I have awareness that my eyebrows feel &amp;#34;gelled&amp;#34; all day which is a little annoying.  The brush is trying to be like the Gimme Brow brush but is too big, abrasive &amp; paints on the skin if you&#x27;re not careful.  It works, but nowhere near as well or as comfortably/easily as Gimme Brow.  Wish I had just shelled out an extra $15 for the product I love.</li>
    <li> The brow mascara is easy to apply. However, the color I choose might be a bit too light. No visible effect on my eyebrow.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Had been using Blink for nearly 3x the price of this product.  Works great, states in place &amp; much easier to remove than Blink. The tiny mascara type brush makes the application easier to maneuver with my brows as they go over bone as they arch.</li>
    <li> Love this. My eyebrows have always been a very light blonde and very thin. I tinted them for many years. Then I started using brow mascara. I tried 2 different brands before finding L&#x27;Oreal. I like this one best because it has a shorter brush and is much easier to use and not get all over. This also fills in nicely where my brows are thinner. This is a fabulous product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Just what I was looking for and the color match was perfect.</li>
    <li> I find this brow mascara easy to apply. I chose a color lighter than my eyebrows and am happy with that choice.</li>
    <li> Looooved it. The brush size is just perfect for shaping and coloring your eyebrows. The colour alaa is so lovely. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> No comparison to a eyebrow pencil.</li>
    <li> this color was almost blonde, way too light for my brow. However, it is a good product that I recommend.</li>
    <li> Holy grail brow product!! As someone with naturally strawberry blonde hair, it&#x27;s so hard to find eyebrow makeup that isn&#x27;t too grey or too dark. My eyebrows are naturally full but super duper invisible due to being blonde so this is the perfect thing for me. It&#x27;s so easy to apply, lasts all day, and isn&#x27;t a pain to get off. I can see this being a bit warm for people with ashy toned hair but if you&#x27;re a redhead, this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> I like it BUT my hair is salt and pepper, and it&#x27;s too brown. Makes my eyebrows stand out too much and look too artificial. Wish they&#x27;d make this for people with gray and graying hair.</li>
    <li> Would be better if permanent make-up because of sweat!</li>
    <li> Like it but too light for me.</li>
    <li> Best ever - better than the Borghese version discontinued 30 yrs ago. I&#x27;ve tried everything trying to reproduce the effect of the old Borghese product including pencils, gels and light brown mascara (I&#x27;m quite good at the last) but the mini-brush allows much better control than a mascara wand and the product has a better viscosity too. Takes no time at all to apply compared with pencils and gels. Also covers grays. Start mid-brow and apply to end and then apply from nose to mid-brow.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when blog sites said this was a dupe for my HG brow gel, Benefit Gimme Brow.  Unfortunately this was not the case. The color on L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s brow plumper is a very warm reddish brown, not attractive on most (brow color tends to be cooler than hair color). It also flakes off throughout the day in horrible little beads. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! It takes a while to get use to but it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> May be I ordered the wrong color but I found it to be too light.</li>
    <li> I own the benefit brow (both colors) and was running out so i decided to try this.  The light to medium is a good color for brien hair and very comparable to the light benefit brow.  I use a brow pencil and follow up with this.  I find it creates a more natural brow</li>
    <li> I had no idea that plucking out my unruly eyebrows as a teenager would result in having very sparse eyebrows as an old lady.  Why didn&#x27;t someone tell me?  Of course, the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; girls shaved theirs off, so I guess I am ahead of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my eyebrows are now pretty sparse -- and a lot of hairs with no pigment -- not exactly gray, but more off-white -- I noticed that they really looked washed out.  I went to the beauty supply and bought almost everything that said &amp;#34;eyebrow&amp;#34; on it.  This stuff works, as it adds little fibers to fill out the brow without looking painted on or fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However -- at least for me -- I have to use a brow tamer wax stick before I apply, or the &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; in the product makes the hairs curl around in all directions and poke out at odd angles.  Once everything is on, I let it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; out a little and then lightly apply a coat of clear brow &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;tamer&amp;#34; to sort of seal the deal.</li>
    <li> Nice and easy for that extra darkness on my graying brows.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of drawing in brows with a pencil - way too time consuming with often uneven results!  I found and used a product very similar to this by Lancome called &amp;#34;Mod√©le Sourcils Brow Expert&amp;#34; (sells for $25) for several years but after becoming a mother I just couldn&#x27;t justify the expense.  While reading some fashion magazines (Glamour, Allure), I noticed that when they gave the product list for various photo shoots they kept listing this product.  Since it looked like the Lancome product I tried it out.  How glad I am that I did!  In my opinion it is even better than Lancome.  You just brush on the gel with a mascara like wand and it smooths, shapes and fills in your brows all at once.  I have very pale sparse brows but this adheres to you skin really well and I have no noticeable wear at the end of the day.  No flaking or fading.  I actually like it better than the Lancome products since that one was very cloudy and had a whipped or fluffy appearance whereas this one is more clear.  I can use the wand to shape and comb the arch of my brow and even draw a little more brow on at the outside corners where I have very few hairs.  I honestly don&#x27;t know how I could be more pleased with this product.  I am a blond so I got the product in the &amp;#34;light to medium&amp;#34; color and it was perfect and natural.</li>
    <li> The color should be Taupe, but it is GOLD. The perfect color of taupe, that always works (for almost everyone), could be described as a light brown, or dark beige, with some gray in it, that is not too red, and not too gold! This is completely gold, which is very unnatural looking. If you like wearing wild, funky colors, then this is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a real shame, because this is the easiest and fastest brow makeup I&#x27;ve ever used!! It looks as good (except for the weird gold color) as anything else, and is much, much faster to apply. I&#x27;ve tried many different ways of doing my brows. I really wish this came in a light, brownish grey color. That would be natural looking, and this would be the ideal product.</li>
    <li> im in love with this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I think I like the actual product, but I&#x27;m not fond of the applicator.  If they reversed the shape of the applicator, I think it would better get the product where I want it.  I&#x27;m looking for a different product with a better applicator.</li>
