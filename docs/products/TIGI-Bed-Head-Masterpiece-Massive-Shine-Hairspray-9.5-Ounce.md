<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells good, holds hair</li>
    <li> IT HOLDS WELL BUT DOESN&#x27;T FEEL HARD OR HEAVY.  SMELLS GREAT TOO! WELL WORTH THE PRICE. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SPEND OVER 3 DOLLARS FOR HAIRSPRAY. I USE SEVERAL TIGI PRODUCTS AND IT PROVES THAT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.</li>
    <li> All time favorite hairspray!  Awesome Amazon price and convenience of ordering. This hairspray has firm hold but also can be flexible when styling.  I have short hair cut that I like to spruce up throughout the day.  When I want to do that I just wet my fingertips and work through hair to reactivate the product. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> This hairspray does some serious work as far as holding your hairstyle in place.  But to get that great hold, you sacrifice movable, soft hair.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I like the fragrance and I have been very pleased with how it holds, with how it sprays. The price is good as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used. It gives a strong hold and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. It also has a nice fragrance unlike some other hairspray I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairspray for the TIGI Bed head deep waver. I absolutely love it. It makes your hair shine and it has serious hold. This is a great product and I recommend it to all of you looking to buy!</li>
    <li> Best hair spray around! Smells great and works great too!  Decent price! I&#x27;m going to order another bottle soon.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Item just as described. Love the product. Great price,Super fast shipping. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Over been using this hairspray for years and I will not use any other product.  The hold is perfect. .. not to light,  not to heavy.  The price on amazon beats the salons and I will continue to order here.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this. I know others thought the fragrance was great but I don&#x27;t like it. In addition, it weighs down my fine hair giving it a greasy look.</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray that holds your hair in New Jersey&#x27;s humidity. It is the best. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be &amp;#34;MASSIVE SHINE&amp;#34;.  I see no shine.  I&#x27;ve tried it for several days now.  It&#x27;s very, very thick hairspray.  It&#x27;s super hold, so if you want some wave, this isn&#x27;t it.  This is like gramma&#x27;s hair net... it feels like sticky cotton candy.  Believe me, there is no shine.  Hold yes, shine no.  And it&#x27;s not a good kind of hold.  It&#x27;s a &#x27;don&#x27;t touch your hair or it will rip it out at the roots&#x27; hold.  Very expensive and over-rated.  Hugely disappointed as I tried it based on the great reviews.  Not sure we all have the idea of &#x27;shine&#x27; or what makes a good hairspray.  I take very good care of my long hair.  This is an epic failure.</li>
    <li> Great hold and smell!</li>
    <li> I love this spray, it smells like sweethearts candy. Sometimes it comes out a little forceful so if you have fly away hair be careful or spray at arms length for the 1st time until it stays then you can spray closer. The price its great! The store cost is $20.99</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this hair product, so I purchased it for her for Christmas.  It was a well recieved gift.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.  Will order from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair shiny with good hold. And it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Super sticky! Hard hold !</li>
    <li> I have limp hair and need a lot of work in order to give it any volume.  Often, I have to put a ton of hairspray in my hair just to make it last more than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I stray from TIGI products, because as a 27 year-old, the smell of their products and fanbase seemed to be too teen for me.  I admit I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell of this hairspray, but I am really impressed by how shiny it makes my hair.  Not sure if this is normal, but it also seems to create a wave in my hair that I find really cute- like an extra bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On it&#x27;s own, it doesn&#x27;t create the \\&quot;puff\\&quot; that I&#x27;m looking for, but it does hold well if enough is used.  I have found there is a really good combination between this product and my usual TRESemm&amp;eacute; Extra Hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has made me curious to try other TIGI products!</li>
    <li> This is the hair spray my beautician uses at her shop.  Now I can have the same look at home.  It is great hold and adds a shine to your hair.</li>
    <li> makes your hair very shiny!  great hold</li>
    <li> good hairspray to use on my pet lion , Steve. his hair is so shiny and awesome when i use this on his spa days .</li>
    <li> Love this product! Maybe a little more expensive than your drugstore – brand hairspray, but totally worth it! You definitely use less</li>
    <li> this is the best hairspray on the market.  it is quite firm for those who don&#x27;t like very firm spray, wont like this.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m addicted to hair spray, I&#x27;ve said it!!! Love Bed Head but can be a little much sometimes , this particular one has great hold but not &amp;#34;helmet &amp;#34; like!! Will order again!! Arrived in record time and packed well. Thanks again Amazon !!  :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, it doesn&#x27;t come out evenly, it&#x27;s almost like watery. And is just sticky.. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a nice hold hair spray that smells good, but this isn&#x27;t it. Then I tried the Aussie, I love the smell, it did not hold, then I got the Aussie freeze, whoa!! Your hair will not go any where with that stuff lol.. I would only use that stuff if my hair is up, but when my hair is down and lightly spray, it&#x27;s just to sticky, hard crunchie hair :( I guess I&#x27;m still on the look out for a great smelling hair spray that will hold, but not give me helmet hair lol..</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  It provides great hold without making my hair feel stiff or crunchy.  Plus, it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> holds pretty well. The scent is so fruity. I hope my hair doesn&#x27;t smell like that once it dries</li>
    <li> Best hair spray ever. I stock up on this stuff every time I go to the states. However, If your hair is wet / damp and you spray it on your style is destroyed.</li>
    <li> I Love the smell of this hairspray. Holds really well on thick hair and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
    <li> I never use hair spray because I hate it in my hair. But OMG I love this stuff. It keeps your hair in place all day and night by just using very little. You can even tell its in there. No stiffness feeling. Perfect for me.</li>
    <li> TIGI Bed Head Masterpiece gives me firm hold while not making my hair seem stiff. I also love the shine it gives my hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and have never liked hair spray. It&#x27;s usually sticky, feels heavy, and the smell is overpowering. That said, TIGI&#x27;s Bed Head Masterpiece Massive Shine hair spray is a great product. It holds all day, doesn&#x27;t feel as sticky or heavy as some hairsprays, and it smells really good to boot! You can use it by itself for a lighter hold, or use it as a finishing product with a wax or gel to hold everything in place and give you some shine. Have been using this product for over a year now, and can&#x27;t imagine living without it. Buying through Amazon is also cheaper than buying in most stores, and with Prime it&#x27;s a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> Smells great, does the job of holding the hair. I use it with a crimper and it works just great</li>
    <li> I prefer aerosol hairspray, and this great.  The hairspray holds well without being sticky and the nozzle is great.  I actually think this works better than some more expensive products I have.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different hairsprays and tigi products and this is by far one of their best.  Great price and super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this spray.  The smell is why I bought it.  The stiffness and hold are much much more than I need.  I want a gentle hold that is not stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to hold hair in place, this is your product.  If you want soft movable hair, keep looking.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser got me hooked on this. Excellent hold on hard to hold short hair.  Provides nice shine and does not yellow my gray. BIG bottle and way cheaper here than in the salon. Also, the bottle will continue to spray till it&#x27;s empty, I like some others that die with product left in the can. Drives my crazy.</li>
    <li> Price buying through Amazon is so much lower than at regular stores! I sure like that. I love this hairspray, especially the smell of it. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look crusty or wet. It&#x27;s very fast acting though. Spray eventually leaves some gummy buildup around the spray opening but it&#x27;s easy to pop off.</li>
    <li> Sprayer is a lil messed up but holds well</li>
    <li> Love it, it does not leave your hair stiff or gummy!</li>
    <li> This hairspray has great all day hold with out the sticky feeling. It has a great scent that is not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> Always love this hairspray but salons around here sell it for triple what it was listed on here.  I have dry short hair and this seems to keep it in place to where I want it.</li>
    <li> I went to my usual store to purchase this item and the price has skyrocketed, so I came home and looked online...only way I&#x27;ll ever order again! I love this product. Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Too sticky and tacky...no additional shine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use hairspray often, only when I curl my hair for a special occasion. This is pricier than other brands you could buy but it does the job well and smells nice. I have to admit that its candy like fragrance is what drew me to buy this over others. I have to use a lot of hair spray as my hair is pretty slick. Why not have your hair smell nice as opposed to a ton of product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairspray to use.  It holds but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or sticky.  Additionally, it is easy to brush out at the end of the day!!</li>
    <li> this spray has a great hold. if you need your hair to stay exactly how you have it for a long time, this spray will likely do the job. it does make your hair very hard and not nice to touch. so as long as you just need it to look good and nobody is gonna touch your hair, you&#x27;re all good.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray, have used it for several years.  I hate the fact it is soooo expensive, but at least the price is better at Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many things about how great this hairspray is.  However, I thought it was sticky and nothing special. It is ok but not worth the price</li>
    <li> This is a good choice for hairspray when shine and good hold are the objectives.  I usually prefer a lighter spray, but this works so well I&#x27;ve continued to use it. Amazon has the best price I have found, especially with Prime.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best hairspray ever! Buying it on Amazon for half the price is amazing too. It holds very well and adds a ton of shine, not to mention it smells incredible. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the scent!and the hold of this spray is fantastic!</li>
    <li> strong and long lasting hold</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED SO MANY HAIRSPRAYS AND WASTED MONEY AND KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS. I HAVE VERY FINE HAIR. THIS PRODUCT ISNT TO HEAVY, AND IT DOESNT DULL MY HAIR (IM BLONDE) LIKE OTHER HAIRSPRAYS. IT ALSO SMELLS WONDERFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and really holds!! Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better hair spray! I would recommend this to every one! Amazing!!</li>
    <li> I never like hairspray before I found this.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since using this product. The smell is fantastic ...very summery, a combo of pineapple and coconut.  Be careful though. Bees love it!</li>
    <li> Holds great without adding too much weight. And the smell is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve smelled. Is it pineapple?</li>
    <li> Best hairspray ever.  It really does make my hair shine.  It costs a tad more but buying on Amazon I do not feel guilty!  Love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love! I have dry, over processed hair that is naturally frizzy. This spray manages to keep my hair in check. It&#x27;s easy to brush out and smells wonderful with the perfect shine!! Very happy!</li>
    <li> great product, great price</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t splurge on hair products but I love this stuff.  It has good hold but what I love is the smell. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> M favorite hairspray it has a nice fruity fragrance (cherry?)  and  a very good hold that isn&#x27;t so sticky that you can&#x27;t brush it out. Also the price on Amazon is a lot less expensive than buying from the salon or even wal-mart.</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray, and is cheaper than at my salon</li>
    <li> This is not at all what I expected. It is very sticky, shows no shine at all..Will not be using it..</li>
    <li> Love it! Holds beter than any I&#x27;ve tried (other than those that make you feel like you&#x27;re wearing aquanet!) It&#x27;s perfect for my needs. I&#x27;m not so sure it adds shine, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t dull.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time.  Smells great, holds great, adds shine.  Have not used anything else in years!  Perfect for my bob.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff.  It holds my fine hair all day.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive and I could find it locally.</li>
    <li> Best hairspray - not too heavy, but just enough to hold, smells great!</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray and it always arrives from Amazon as it should!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest hair find out there for my husband and me! It not only holds your hair in place perfectly, it SHINES. I will definitely order this on a regular basis as I&#x27;ve seen no other product that compares.</li>
    <li> I got sick of disgusting smelling hairspray. I used to buy Aussi non-aerosol, and got lots of complements on the scent, but over the years they slowly took the grape scent away and replaced it with horrible-smelling hairspray.  I have been searching for good smelling hairsprays, and this one definitely smells great.  It&#x27;s pricey, though.</li>
    <li> This smells like candy!! Best smelling hairspray of all time. My 6 year old boy loves it too, looks like I&#x27;ll be sharing.</li>
    <li> Great hold and great shine!</li>
    <li> This is the only hair spray I like/use. I bought it from here because it&#x27;s cheaper than in a salon.</li>
    <li> Light with great shine and hold.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite hairspray of all time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves no dull residue, instead adds a perfect touch of shine &amp; a wonderful fruity, fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;Great hold, even in high-humidity.&lt;br /&gt;Love the large size can...lasts a really long time since you do not need a lot of product to get great hold.&lt;br /&gt;The nozzle never clogs like some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;It will spray all the way down to the last drop...no waste!</li>
    <li> Smells like bubblegum and pineapples, I love it</li>
    <li> Great hairspray. Holds even the most stubborn hair. Our family has very heavy hair and this hairspray works great for holding styles without hair falling</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. Holds well and smells good</li>
    <li> The BEST hairspray EVER!!!  Great hold but not heavy, looks natural.  It is my forever hairspray!</li>
    <li> First discovered this hairspray when my hair dresser used it on me and it smelled SOO GOOD.. I asked the name and then ordered it from Amazon because your price was better. A little goes a long way so that makes a better deal also.</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray over all the others, holds really well and never flakes . I can brush my hair &amp; restyle it the next day and spray it on again without it looking dirty or sticky. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> Great price, quick shipping. Love this product.</li>
    <li> After using this just one time I was in love.</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray.It smells wonderful, and provides a great hold.I will definitely be ordering it again.Thank you.  Catherine A.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave residue and leaves your hair shiny.  I love how it holds well, which is something my fine hair requires.</li>
    <li> This hairspray held my hair during humid days when usually I can&#x27;t control the frizzies. It also gives my hair a healthy shine. Not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Great price since it is the only product that wife likes.</li>
    <li> This is great and it smells so yummy!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it smells almost like candy but people don&#x27;t notice you&#x27;re wearing hairspray, this is officially my main product for styling my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> The only hairspray I use.  Great deal!!</li>
    <li> Holds good and smells good.  Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Great hair products, my daughters favorite brand.  Good price and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Bed Head. I really like this product. Holds but isn&#x27;t sticky or crusty.</li>
    <li> Best strong hold hairspray.</li>
    <li> This hairspray smells great and holds nicely!</li>
    <li> the smell is too strong for my taste.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Holds without being stiff and sticky.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and service. I received the hair spray very fast! No build up on your hair from the hairspray.</li>
    <li> I have been using bed head products for years and I would highly recommend them to others.  I give it Five Stars.</li>
    <li> Omg this keeps my hair in place so well I love it I also use it on daughter also it smells amazing!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> When I got it, it didn&#x27;t spray, seemed to be clogged, ran top under hot water, didn&#x27;t seem to do the trick, so I took the top off the one that was running out &amp; replaced the cap and was good to go.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairspray. I wish I could find a travel size. Just the right amount of hold and shine.</li>
    <li> I had tried this at a friends house and absolutely loved the smell. It&#x27;s like a mix of pineapple and candy. So I went to the store to buy one and it was $19. I came to Amazon and found it for almost half the price. It smells good and has a strong hold that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This holds well without using alot. Doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair or make it sticky at all.  I just love it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and live in the South, so I am prone to frizzies and fly-aways. Over the years I have tried just about every product and spray to keep them at bay, and this spray tops the cake! Incredible hold, fights humidity all day long and hair still remains shiny! I absolutely love it and will not use anything else. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because your hair does get stiff and it can be hard to brush out at times. But other than that it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and a much better price than in the salon! We will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Best Hair Spray just spendy any where else but on amazo...</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray -- received right away -- it costs a lot less than buying it at my Salon!!</li>
    <li> Works great, and it&#x27;s the only hairspray that doesn&#x27;t make my husband whine about hairspray-y fumes. Back combed perfection, albeit a little pricey. But non-whiny husband? Priceless.</li>
    <li> Great smell and flexibly hold!</li>
    <li> This is pretty much the only hairspray my teen daughter will use, and it is difficult to find where I live.  She can spike, twist, mohawk, and punk her short hair in pretty much any direction and this sets it all day.  No matter what.  It stands up to wind and high humidity very well.  Also, like many bedhead products, this smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have baby fine hair and it holds but does not weight down my hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; good price.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS HAIRSPRAY!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great spray for a special event (glossing, smells fantastic).&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, and it&#x27;s a big one for me, is that the next day, if I don&#x27;t wash my hair, it&#x27;s left so heavy/greasy from the oils in the spray.</li>
    <li> I love heavy duty hairspray, but I don&#x27;t like the crunch it can leave on my hair. This hairspray has great hold and shine without the crunch. I also love the fruity (strawberry) scent. Shop around and you can find good deals on the price.</li>
    <li> I like this hairspray.  Makes my hair shiny and it holds great!</li>
    <li> Good price from Amazon and good product!</li>
    <li> Great product and decent price. Its hairspray that does its job. I don&#x27;t know if how it&#x27;s shipped matters to you, but I hate damaged goods. The way the shipped this with other items I ordered, left it with possibly being broken. As per usual with amazon packed orders, my order was in a box inside of a box. Well, the outer box was falling apart and partially open, and this was jammed in the outer box and the inner box. SOoo, it could&#x27;ve been damaged or even thrown out of the box due to how damaged that outer box was. Just an fyi because I like my products to arrive undamaged. Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. A little too sticky. I like a light hairspray. Will probably try something else next time.</li>
    <li> Hands down this is the best hairspray I have ever used! It smells amazing and gives your hair a healthy shine. It holds my curls all day and keeps my hair looking great even in humid weather. I have gone through 2 bottles of this stuff and still love it! It is so worth the money (although I wish it would not be so pricey!) It also lasted me about six months, which was a plus. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a spray for hard-to-hold hair.  I found this in a $3 travel size at Ulta and since I was going on a trip to humid San Francisco, I decided to take it with me.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  It held my hard-to-hold hair perfectly and it didn&#x27;t seemed phased at all by the mist drifting in from the Bay.  I bought two and needed only about half of one can for the entire 10 days I was in SF.  You only need the slightest misting of this spray if you&#x27;re wearing a loose wavy style like I was.  Too much looks like helmet head.  But when I put my hair in an updo, this spray helped hold the tiny flyaways around my hairline in check.  I simply sprayed it on and then ran my brush through to flatten those annoying little hairs.  It also lasted all day and into the night.  I didn&#x27;t check to see if it contained water (some hairsprays do, much to my chagrin) but I doubt it, the hold is too good.  I will definitely be buying the full size can.  Even at the higher price, the hold is definitely worth it.  I&#x27;ve tried almost all the drugstore hairsprays and haven&#x27;t found a single one with the strength of the TIGI.  And that&#x27;s saying something.  My hall closet is crammed with all the failed drugstore specimens that never measured up.  The only other hairspray I&#x27;ve come across with comparable hold is CHI&#x27;s Helmet Head.  Both are great.  Which one I use simply depends on the price.  I&#x27;ve purchased the CHI at TJ Maxx for $10 and they also have had the TIGI there from time to time.  I won&#x27;t pay more than $10 for a can of hairspray.  Any more seems highway robbery!  All in all, this is a fantastic product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product - always have.....Glad to see you don&#x27;t have to pay $25.00 for it on Amazon..</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate the VERY STONG smell of this!  I had to go wash it out of my hair after putting it on! Way to strong and sweet smelling!!!!  I gave it away to someone else. I don&#x27;t know if they will like it either, but to each their own I guess! Definitely NOT for me!</li>
    <li> this spray won&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or sticky. It will provide hold and shine.  I love this product and have been using it for years</li>
    <li> Pretty much the best hairspray I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s got a super duper hold and doesn&#x27;t look like it. Perfect.</li>
    <li> but I was a bit disappointed. IT smells pretty good. Maybe I just have to get used to it. oh well</li>
    <li> Love the smell and good hold.</li>
    <li> I did not notice that it was an aresol and not a spritz; my mistake.  With that being said, the hold is great and it sprays with ease.  I loved the smell when I first sprayed it onto my hair..  But after a few hours, my hair smelled like I had been in a smoke-filled bar all night.  I do not even smoke and was not in a bar.  It was so stinky that I had to wash my hair again before bed. I read the reviews regarding the smell being great.  I tried it one more time and had the same problem, my hair stunk.  Maybe it is my shampoo and conditioner and my own oils in my hair that caused the smell in conjunction with this product..  But I will not be buying it again nor would I recommend. The spray came  wrapped fine and on time.</li>
    <li> The only hairspray I will use.  It&#x27;s half the price on Amazon!  It smells SO great and does a great job.  Not sticky or gummy.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair, but the texture is baby-fine.  TIGI Masterpiece keeps it in place without &amp;#34;gluing&amp;#34; it.  And smells great!</li>
    <li> The best hold and great scent. My preferred hairspray. Everyone should definitely try this, you&#x27;ll love it for sure. Great product.</li>
    <li> The best shine ever. I love it, and I recommend it to each and everyone of the ladies out there who is looking for the best &#x27;DEEP WAVE&#x27;..</li>
    <li> Best I have found. I have colored, permed and thin hair. It does the job and does not give you the &amp;#34;plastic head&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> Smells like a delicious basket of fruit, and holds well. Not sure if it&#x27;s so amazing that&#x27;s it&#x27;s worth the price, but I use it sparingly, so I know it will last me quite a while.</li>
    <li> My daughter introduced me to these wonderful products.  The shampoo and conditioner really make your hair softer and their scents are fabulous.  The wonderful scents stay fresh all day.  The hairspray is the best.  You are guaranteed that your curls will stay the same shape all day long, even in humid weather.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and was exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray. Smells good and really does keep things shiny. One step up from this (hold-wise) would be the big silver Hard Head hairspray, but that one doesn&#x27;t smell good and does not promise shine, which is why day to day I&#x27;ll use this one.</li>
    <li> Expensive but doesn&#x27;t require much per spray to give nice hold without creating a &amp;#34;helmet&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> Great hair spray.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hairspray and I am not paid for this review (I swear!).  I have fine hair and am always on the look out for hair products to improve my hair&#x27;s volume. After I wash my hair and blow dry it, I flip my head over and spray this, when I flip back, my hair looks amazing due to the volume this spray adds to my hair.  I feel ready for a hair commercial after using it.  Worth every penny!  Very strong hold and gives great shine.  You can run your fingers through you hair to guide shaping of your overall look to break up the initial stiffness.  Absolutely love it and found my forever hairspray!!  I also like Chi Enviro 54 (I keep both in the house) for a softer hold and shine.</li>
    <li> Works on real hair and fake. Doesn&#x27;t make it look hard. Smells AMAZING</li>
    <li> Best hair spray on the market.  If you want hair to &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, this is it.  I think it adds a bit of natural shine to my hair, as well.</li>
    <li> I love the Bed Head hairspray.  It has a wonderful scent and it has terrific hold.</li>
