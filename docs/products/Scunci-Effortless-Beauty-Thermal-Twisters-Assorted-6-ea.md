      <li>Did not feel good to feel and the colors were not the one I selected.</li>

      <li>They are okay</li>

      <li>Give them a try, I&#x27;ve been using them for years and love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love them and their colors.</li>
      <li>I been wearing scrunchies for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I like these so much better than rubber bands.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t break my hair while pulling it out and stays on my silkiest hair too. :)</li>
      <li>but they are able to keep my hair in place.</li>
      <li>So I used to love these things.</li>
      <li>Should have known better.</li>
      <li>and I love them.</li>
      <li>You get more.</li>
      <li>With elastics or clips, I have to brush my hair and use a mirror to be sure I&#x27;ve got it even</li>
      <li>These are adorable.</li>
      <li>I love wearing scrunchies at night</li>
      <li>the elastic stretches more than the material does so</li>
      <li>many of us used in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>and I was wrapping more then twice</li>
      <li>And who couldn&#x27;t use a dose of the 90s once in a while? :)</li>
      <li>Please...whoever makes &#x27;em...make more of the &amp;#34;shoestring&#x27; type.</li>
      <li>since I have to wear my hair up every day I work, I love the fact that I have options for colors.  </li>
      <li>so I guess it is ok.</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>I think I lost most of them</li>
      <li>Fabric is interesting.  </li>
      <li>The are of good strong quality in great colors , great price, and they hold a mean pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They feel great to me, and she loves having them in because they hold up strong but feel really good at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I have long curly hair and these are perfect.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to put in, easy to remove.  </li>
      <li>They are easy to use, won&#x27;t pull out your hair and keep your hair out of your face when exercising.</li>
      <li>Easy to get them here.</li>
      <li>love these they hold my hair back great</li>
      <li>But I forgot how easy they are and don&#x27;t damage my locks.</li>
      <li>The colory variety is nice, but that&#x27;s about the only good thing I can say about these, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Mine are still decently strong after about 6 months.</li>
      <li>These scrunchies are pretty nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say that is a good deal compared to having to buy new scrunchies every couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i have fine hair</li>
      <li>so, i got some scrunchies and put them in my beard and hair, they are colorful and kinda cute</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t catch or tangle my hair when I put them on or pull them off, which is precisely what I&#x27;d been hoping for.</li>
      <li>The material feels cheap and scratchy.</li>
      <li>Not too proud to throw it back to the 90s and order these.  </li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>Not only is the price great on Amazon</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These work well unless you have really thick curly hair like my daughter, then forget about it.  I wish they were a little more stretchy but they do the job for me.</li>
    <li> Love these!!!  Good quality, versatile colors, and a great price. I would definitely recommend these and will repurchase again.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got me this exact same pack at Target a couple of years ago and I loved them. Then I lost the white one and really missed it and checked Target to get more and they no longer had them. I was quite disappointed about that and was happy to find them on Amazon after searching online. I ordered them and when I received them and went to use them I realized that while they looked the same they were not. With the second pack I was only able to wrap my ponytail twice instead of three times like I could with the first pack. Because of this I now have to use a regular elastic on my hair under the scrunchies from the second pack to get the hold that I need which is quite frustrating. I double up with the srunchie because I feel like it looks nicer then just a straight elastic. Evidently like so many other products on the market are doing, the quality of their product is declining while the prices stay the same. I still believe scunci to be a good product, just not as good as it used to be. I also wonder if I order more online what size they will be as there is no way to know until you get them which I really wish wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
    <li> I think the quality is good and I like the colors.</li>
    <li> Best scunci I ever had. It doesn&#x27;t break my hair while pulling it out and stays on my silkiest hair too. :)</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture, I got one green scrunchie in the bunch, which I don&#x27;t mind but just saying it may be different from the pic, what you get... I&#x27;ve been wanting these type of scrunchies for a long time! Cute when wearing around your wrist and very soft and gentle on your hair. Love them!</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my fiance who has been buying cheap hair ties from brick and mortar stores her entire life.  Not only is the price great on Amazon but they have been excellent for my fiance.  They feel great to me, and she loves having them in because they hold up strong but feel really good at the same time.  Certainly worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> I like to put my hair back n a bun sometimes and these hold my hair in place perfectly.  I have long curly hair and these are perfect.  Not much else to say about a Barrette.</li>
    <li> Great Product and great price  :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE.  They don&#x27;t pull my hair out.  They can keep your hair pulled back really loose or really tight.  They&#x27;re easy to put in, easy to remove.  No matter what you&#x27;re wearing, at least one of these will match your outfit. I also wear these when I swim, then throw them in with my laundry and then they don&#x27;t smell like chlorine!    I HATE MY HAIR TOUCHING MY FACE.  I HATE MY HAIR HOT AGAINST THE BACK OF MY NECK.  So I use these literally 99.99% of the time.  There is not a better product on the market.</li>
    <li> Work great. Perfect colors!</li>
    <li> These are my second set and I love them. They truly don&#x27;t cut your hair and are comfotable. I&#x27;m having trouble with thinning hair after illness, but these still work fine, however I will use them all the time when my hair grows back in again.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and it is hard to find hair binders that can hold my hair, but these bad boys do it.</li>
    <li> These are great. I have long thick hair, I hate tying up my hair, because hair ties usually rip my hairs out. I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to try these out. I won&#x27;t be buying elastic ties anymore!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and use hair ties all the time. I have tried them all. These are the BEST. Why? They grip well, they do not damage my hair with metal pieces and they last a long time. I hate it when stores like Walgreens don&#x27;t carry them. I highly recommend this specific product. I have used these for years!</li>
    <li> The elastic is made of poor quality, after few use it feels loose.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair and depend on hair twists to pull it up and keep it off my neck. These are large enough that I can wrap 3 times to form a ponytail but the fabric and the inner elastic are rather thin and they just don&#x27;t look as nice as thicker ones I&#x27;ve purchased. They are okay but I feel like they will stretch out pretty easily. If you want something nicer looking, I&#x27;d hold out for ones with thicker fabric.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and is as expected!</li>
    <li> not the quality they used to be, but they work.</li>
    <li> A bit expensive . Nice colors and good fit</li>
    <li> Very cute, and functional scruncis. I use them for my work outs. Keeps my hair out of the way, just what I need.</li>
    <li> They do the job and since they&#x27;re a bit big its harder for me to just lose them.</li>
    <li> These are your basic twisters which is exactly what I wanted.  The are of good strong quality in great colors , great price, and they hold a mean pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They shipped fast and I opened the package fast and am using them now :)</li>
    <li> These work, but the fabric isn&#x27;t soft like what I expected. Material also seems thinner than normal and elastic is not very strong... not up to par.</li>
    <li> love these they hold my hair back great i have fine hair so its hard to find good hair things i would reccomend these to anyone with fine hair like mine thanks so much will definately be buying more of these in the future</li>
    <li> Great bands that you just can&#x27;t find in the store. Thank You...</li>
    <li> Great Product Quality. Great Price. Great Colors. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> A nice and simple product to hold up your hair. My hair is thin, so it is a little loose on me.</li>
    <li> I bought this back and when I received it, the white one was replaced with bright green. This is super frustrating because I really wanted the white one.</li>
    <li> They are what they are. Scruchi. Same ones I have been wearing for years. Work well on my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;I can throw them in the washing machine time and time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are hard to find in stores, walmart, Walgreens. Easy to get them here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered both types I can find on here, to replace some raggedy, &amp;#34;shoestring&amp;#34; ones..which I can&#x27;t find, anymore.&lt;br /&gt;These are larger than the other set...and work better.  Please...whoever makes &#x27;em...make more of the &amp;#34;shoestring&#x27; type.</li>
    <li> since I have to wear my hair up every day I work, I love the fact that I have options for colors.  these are made to last</li>
    <li> These things are great! They stay put to keep my hip-length hair out of my face. The thermal texture makes them more slide resistant than the other hair ties I have, but is much more gentle and hair friendly than a clip. Just the right amount of stretch. I toss them in the laundry occasionally and they come out good as new.</li>
    <li> Great product, does not slide off my hair, which is the case for most scrunchies I use. the only bad thing is that it is bulky and so it sometimes looks weird whenever I wear them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the white scunci and I didn&#x27;t receive a white one....very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Nice colors but a bit too bulky for my needs. The material snags my hair a bit.</li>
    <li> can never have enough !</li>
    <li> After doing a little price comparisons on hair ties of this variety, I decided to order these. I bought these to help protect my hair at night since other hair ties were causing my hair to become tangled up in them...resulting in breakage. These little things are great though. They don&#x27;t catch or tangle my hair when I put them on or pull them off, which is precisely what I&#x27;d been hoping for. They don&#x27;t pull at your hair unnecessarily, yet they never lose their shape and fall off. Love them!</li>
    <li> LUV my scuncis!!! Stretched the old 1&#x27;s out! Does not hurt the hair!</li>
    <li> These are very comfortable. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> so im a big fat hairy dude, i scare people when i go out. people say &amp;#34;why aren&#x27;t you under the bridge with the other trolls?&amp;#34; and then they chase me with pitchforks and torches. so, i got some scrunchies and put them in my beard and hair, they are colorful and kinda cute i admit. but, people think im quirky and smart. they stop throwing chicken bones and vegetables and smile. who wouldn&#x27;t want that??</li>
    <li> My sister laughs at me for rocking scrunchees again. But I forgot how easy they are and don&#x27;t damage my locks. I love them!</li>
    <li> A bit different color offering among all but the black (with different hues than traditionally sold with the combo)...most notably, with a modern, bright, green instead of the expected navy blue scrunchy!  Oh well, these are very handy...and nice for the price!!!  :-)</li>
    <li> I like these so much better than rubber bands. These don&#x27;t pull my hair and I get a nice bounce in my hair when I let it down after wearing these.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly thick, wavy hair.  I&#x27;d read these twisters were quite large, but I couldn&#x27;t even get them wrapped around my hair twice.  They simply won&#x27;t hold the weight of my hair.  The colory variety is nice, but that&#x27;s about the only good thing I can say about these, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/17/14 UPDATE: While trying to fit these around my thick hair, I&#x27;ve broken two.  They just snap.  I would not recommend anybody buy these if you have even remotely thick hair.  They&#x27;re WAY too small.</li>
    <li> Not as tight elastic as I would have liked...have to tripple up on it to get it to stay on....</li>
    <li> The one I received was not the one in the photo. I had used the one in the photo and it was mostly corton, if not 100%. The one I received definitely had nylon in it. Did not feel good to feel and the colors were not the one I selected. But I&#x27;m using it, it &#x27;functions&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This scunci is for a little ballerina with a lots of hair, thick and frizzle, but for her ballet its hold her long hair together although she uses 2, but her hair is very very long.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair pulled back.  It is thin, these were huge for my thin hair.  I ended up returning them</li>
    <li> I have been wearing the scuncis for ever. They keep my hair up and out of my face.</li>
    <li> Perfect scrunchies! They are good quality and serve their purpose as they are supposed to. Nice range of neutral colors. I recommend.</li>
    <li> These are fine - a commercial product, made well, nice soft colors.  Fabric is interesting.  My eldest son has very long hair and after trying one he took about half of these for his own use.  I use these a lot and like having a choice of color.</li>
    <li> I quite enjoy the thermal texture of these scrunchies, and they hold much better than my old ones. It was about time for new ones!</li>
    <li> Buying these might have been a little nostalgic on my part however, I still found that the product is a sound one that I use frequently.</li>
    <li> I love these, I use them everyday and they never lose their shape! I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The 80&#x27;s in me love these!  I wear them when I have PJs on (not in public, sadly).  Nice, soft, you can rest your head back and not feel a huge lump.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice hair accessory.  You can put your hair up and out of your face and coordinate your hair accessory with your clothes.  Nice.</li>
    <li> They are the only ones that hold my hair in place without making my pony too tight. Others fall out.</li>
    <li> these are great! I wear my hair at night in a ponytail&lt;br /&gt;and wrap a roller around it and very comfortable&lt;br /&gt;to sleep in, in the morning take out the roller&lt;br /&gt;and you have a curl, I also use them with a&lt;br /&gt;hot roller the same way, saves time having to put&lt;br /&gt;rollers all over your head, and they glide right&lt;br /&gt;out of your hair, they have saved my hair.</li>
    <li> These Thermal Twisters don&#x27;t last forever and eventually the elastic wears out. So I find I have to buy these every few years. They are easy to use, won&#x27;t pull out your hair and keep your hair out of your face when exercising. They are also perfect when you are having a bad hair day and just want to put your hair up into a ponytail. Give them a try, I&#x27;ve been using them for years and love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Love them and their colors. They fit great. I have always used them. They have the waffle type look to them also. They are great casual look.</li>
    <li> Like the versatile colors!  It fits a little loosely by itself but works fine when I add an elastic band with it.</li>
    <li> I got these to use as a quick way to get my hair out of my face so I could brush my teeth and wash my face before bed.  They work great for that.  Except...  my dog likes to steal them!  :)  They are a good size, but next time I will get more colorful ones.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for your hair when you are  busy or having a bad hair day.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are great and they wash easily.</li>
    <li> Not hefty like the last set I bought. Thinner. Fabric and less elastic. Should have known better. Again very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you expect to get. I love wearing scrunchies at night so my hair doesn&#x27;t break as much.</li>
    <li> I use these  scuncies every day to pull my hair up off my neck and keep my hair neatly styled .</li>
    <li> I ordered these from Amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find them locally.  These are my preferred hair bands as they are large and don&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
    <li> I got these to replace my old scrunchies which had worn out old elastic. These scrunchies are awful. the elastic stretches more than the material does so when you put your hair up in them as tight as you can fit the material around the elastic doesn&#x27;t hold tight because there is still more stretch in them. After wearing your hair up for 10 minutes they start to slide and then come out completely unless you continually readjust them. I should have kept my old scrunchies, they worked better than these ones do.</li>
    <li> I have finally found something that doesn&#x27;t pull my thick head of hair!! I have an outfit that matches all the colors. I prefer these over the thin elastic ones.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time when I work out.  The fit seems to be loose compared to previous ones I have bough.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great little hair scrunchies for those who don&#x27;t need to wrap more than twice to hold a ponytail.  They will definitely hold your ponytail while preventing breakage better than normal elastics.  And who couldn&#x27;t use a dose of the 90s once in a while? :)</li>
    <li> For my daughter and so far she has not complained about the product so I guess it is ok. ok</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t damage the hair. Just as depicted.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time and wanted to restock my supply. I thought these were the same scunci&#x27;s I owned based on the photos but they are not. The material feels cheap and scratchy. Otherwise, they are comparable to my others in terms of hold and strength, I just wish they were a softer material like my current ones.</li>
    <li> I bought these to sleep in, and they are perfect for that.  I have very thick hair and would need to wrap them 3 times to get them to stay for daily wear.  Again, I bought them to gently hold my hair while sleeping and they are perfect for that.</li>
    <li> Good number of hair scrungies.</li>
    <li> They are scuncis! Exactly what you would expect it to be. I gave this as a a gift. She likes them.</li>
    <li> These are smaller than the ones you normally find in stores. I have very lick and long hair, and I can usually use one of the regular size of these to get two, almost three, twists around my hair in a pony tail. With these, I have to pull pretty hard to get it around the second time. Whether you like these or not will probably depend on how you feel about the twisting size. The original larger Scunci was half a twist too large for my hair, so it left my hair somewhat lose. This wouldn&#x27;t be as big of a problem, except that my hairs so heavy, it has to but up in a very tight pony tail or else it falls down under it&#x27;s own weight in just minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this Scunci being smaller, I can just barely pull it around my hair twice. This actually makes for a tighter ponytail for my hair, and will keep it held up. The smaller size also keeps it from looking like a huge poof of fabric in your hair. More of a smaller sporty look than the big poofy Scuncis many of us used in the 90&#x27;s. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what I thought of them. Then after using them for a few weeks, I realized that it was a good change, and I liked them quite a bit.</li>
    <li> These are adorable. I have thick hair but they are able to keep my hair in place. I use an elastic hair tie first before putting on a scrunchie if I want my hair to be tight and secure. However, if I want it a bit loose and still keep my hair in place, I use the scrunchie alone.</li>
    <li> These are the only ones I really like, with the waffle texture.They are nice and solid.I been wearing scrunchies for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I like to match them with my clothes when going out and wear them around the house.I have really long hair and more than down it is up in my scrunchie.These are a good deal on them and the colors are nice for fall.Amazon shipped them fast and in new condition</li>
    <li> They are ok but kind of big I ended up using them for purposes other then my hair. I have thick hair just below my shoulders and I was wrapping more then twice wich defeats a scrunchy purpose in my mind as it becomes less soft. And the colors are kind of meh. I haven&#x27;t tried wrapping one around a regular pony tail holder. Just not the best schrunchies.</li>
    <li> no problems. what is there to say about scrunchies?</li>
    <li> Product was as expected, good quality. I would recommend. They are a little smaller than I thought but I can still use them!</li>
    <li> Feels much thinner and cheaper than they used to be.  Maybe it&#x27;s just because I haven&#x27;t used scrunchies in years, but I don&#x27;t remember them feeling this way.  Feels like the elastic will snap if I pull too hard to wrap up all of my hair.  I guess I would buy them again because I can&#x27;t find good ones.  But I&#x27;m not crazy about them.  The fabric isn&#x27;t very soft either.  Cheap.</li>
    <li> Wish there were more colors in the batch, but very nice quality.</li>
    <li> So I used to love these things. I have long straight, medium thick hair. I have for years wrapped this twice and then on the third wrap I only pulled my hair half through. Just as a quick get it out of my face and off my neck. In the last year or so I have bought probably 6 packs of these. Looking for what I used to buy. It seems that I just need to accept that the material is cheaper and they are smaller PERIOD! I can no longer use these the way I use to use them. It&#x27;s too tight and pulls my hair. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Material is not like the ones I found at the store. Fabric and elastic we&#x27;re very thin and cheap. Fabric felt almost plasticy. Weird. Does not hold hair well.</li>
    <li> These scrunchies are pretty nice. I have thick hair, so it&#x27;s hard to find scrunchies that aren&#x27;t completely wimpy and run away at the sight of my mop. They start off quite tight, but like any scrunchie, they get loose after a few months. Mine are still decently strong after about 6 months. I&#x27;d say that is a good deal compared to having to buy new scrunchies every couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me and wear your hair up to bed, or you just wear your hair up a lot in general, these are a solid pick for scrunchies that will last you a decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for the money. You get more. I seen these at walmart for the same price but you only get 3.</li>
    <li> I have long naturally curly fairly thick hair, and I almost always wear it pulled back in a clip or elastic.  I like the cloth-covered scrunchies because they&#x27;re easier on my hair.  These Scunci twisters have been wonderful in the past: substantial heavy elastic, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something happened between the last package I purchased (maybe 2-3 yrs ago) and now, because these new ones aren&#x27;t nearly up to the quality of my older ones.  The elastic is thinner, there&#x27;s not as much material -- just generally not as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use them, but it looks like they&#x27;re going to wear out much quicker.  I&#x27;ve had these for about 6 weeks, and one of them has already failed (elastic broke).  On the plus side, you get six of them for just under a dollar each, so they&#x27;re not too expensive.  Still, I&#x27;m going to look around for another option.</li>
    <li> Most of the time around the house, I pull my long hair up in a ponytail.  I used to have tone of scrunchies when I was a kid, but I think they became passe or something because I haven&#x27;t had them or thought about them for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scrunchies are great -- better than elastics or clips because they are quicker, easier and softer, and they require no skill whatsoever.  With elastics or clips, I have to brush my hair and use a mirror to be sure I&#x27;ve got it even and there aren&#x27;t any pooches of hair when I pull it back, but the softness of the scrunchie means you can just pull your hair into it and adjust by feel.  But the scrunchie holds just as well as elastics or clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot how much I love them and am so glad to have them back! Six solid, neutral colors mean they go with everything and they are made of soft cotton (or cotton-ish) fabric, so they don&#x27;t look too childish, just neat and clean and my hair is out of my face!</li>
    <li> Scunci invented hair ties and my first set of these, 15 years ago, finally had to be replaced. I think I lost most of them but the very last one lasted a good 5 years of &amp;#34;used very often&amp;#34; use.</li>
    <li> comfortable.. not to large. love them around the house because i dont get headaches if i sleep with it in</li>
    <li> I like these. I use them a lot to tie my hair back.</li>
    <li> Perfect as usal these are classic scunci and will last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> There is no white one u get green instead</li>
    <li> These protect my hair from splitting.</li>
    <li> Not too proud to throw it back to the 90s and order these.  Work great!  Wanted a hair tie that wouldn&#x27;t be so harsh on my fine hair at night.  I remembered wearing one or three of these  in my hair at middle school dances back in the day, so thought I would give them a whirl again!</li>
    <li> They are Scuncis.  They hold my very long (bra length) baby fine hair with no problem and don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Not the colors shown in the picture unsatisfied</li>
    <li> Very nice, soft and well made; good choice of colors in the pack.  Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> The rubber band doesn&#x27;t last long. I have only had these for few weeks and now they&#x27;re all stretched out.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured.  I was surprised that they hold the hair so well.  Not particularly attractive, but functional.  Will add a star later if they prove to be durable.</li>
    <li> Right now my hair is just barely brushing my shoulders. These are perfect! They are the size of regular ponytail holders. Perfect for those with normal to thin hair. You don&#x27;t have that huge bulky scrunchie weighing your hair down.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for my wife. She loves them and they are exactly what they wanted.</li>
