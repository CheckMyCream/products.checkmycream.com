### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s like medecine for curly hair. :D</li>
      <li>The best on the market</li>
      <li>Used separately, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with the conditioner.</li>
      <li>the smell is wonderful..</li>
      <li>It is very good for hair, and its presence probably explains the shampoos brownish color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works great for my hair, but I don&#x27;t expect a shampoo to work miracles.</li>
      <li>The results were great shiny hair with no flyaways.</li>
      <li>But it does a great job of softening my hair as if it had a conditioner in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a great duo.</li>
      <li>great</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say the frizz is well tamed.</li>
      <li>My daughter loved it....</li>
      <li>This worked great for her hair &amp; I have already ordered more.</li>
      <li>Tubes are great to take on trips as they pack easier than bottles and are more pliable in a shower bag.  </li>
      <li>It has good smell and abundant lather.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>The conditioner felt nice</li>
      <li>But using these two Dove products together, I&#x27;m loving how well it works for my hair.</li>
      <li>I think it is important to still use a good leave in</li>
      <li>tube was very lightly scented and didn&#x27;t leave a scent in my hair after rinsing.  </li>
      <li>The scent is nice, but it&#x27;s a bit on the strong side.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see too many affordable shampoos in tubes these days.  </li>
      <li>I can go two days without having to wash my hair and the curls stay so much more defined.</li>
      <li>So now I love how the conditioner works, after trying it with the shampoo.</li>
      <li>My mom said she love it and will def recommend it</li>
      <li>It is ok and lathers up well</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t love the shampoo.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is phenomenal though.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I found that I like the matching Dove conditioner quite a bit more, when I use it with this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not even remotely enjoyable to use.  </li>
      <li>Again, the results I got were phenomenal.  </li>
      <li>It is creamy and very rich.  </li>
      <li>It has rich lather and a gentle pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>I wish the parfume wasn&#x27;t so strong.</li>
      <li>but it the fragrance is way too strong</li>
      <li>stuff does have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>The shampoo has a rather strong scent.</li>
      <li>It has a mild, pleasant scent - much like Nexxus brand products.  </li>
      <li>Works fine</li>
      <li>But I was less impressed with the shampoo.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to work up a rich lather, cleans well and rinses off easily.</li>
      <li>I like the Dove Advanced Hair Series Ultra Nourishing Shampoo.</li>
      <li>I wish the scent was a tad milder since I didn&#x27;t really enjoy it in the shower.</li>
      <li>Conditioner equally fantastic.  </li>
      <li>But the stench of cheap perfume is lingering and giving me a migraine.  </li>
      <li>B00R0UK878 Dove Advanced Hair Series Ultra Nourishing Conditioner]].</li>
      <li>The results were great, I could finally get a brush through my hair without tugging!  </li>
      <li>think this shampoo is as good as most especially at this price point.</li>
      <li>It does have a strong smell I personally think it smells good however some will disagree with me.</li>
      <li>but my hair just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean when using it.</li>
      <li>My wife gave it a try but in a short time she had to wash her hair again with a pleasant scented shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is a very good shampoo that lathers up great with only a small amount.</li>
      <li>The first thing you notice about the Dove Advanced Series Ultra Nourishing shampoo is the creamy, yellowish color and strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this it really work well for my curl.</li>
      <li>I like the product but have only used it once since I purchased it, so it may take some time to see if I get good results.</li>
      <li>I go through product way too quickly for these tiny containers, which leads me to 2) please have this available in more stores!  </li>
      <li>Very gentle support for even my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I personally liked the smell, and was happy with the thickness of the product - but the color was a tiny bit strange.</li>
      <li>Otherwise you&#x27;ll be burning through your wallet way too quickly.</li>
      <li>However my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy looking as quickly with this Dove shampoo as it does with shampoo that also has conditioner in it.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo comes out beige and looks a bit different than most shampoos to me, but I LOVE the lather.  </li>
      <li>Loreal has a good line that offers more (12.6 Fl Oz) for the same price.</li>
      <li>My daughter has really curly hair that tangles easily</li>
      <li>Dove Quench is a good shampoo for those who have very dry hair, or chemically treated hair, or those who dye the hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo has a golden hue to it.  </li>
      <li>have fine, wavy hair that dries out pretty fast.</li>
      <li>This shampoo made my hair feel kind of dry, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>My hair used to be fine and straight, and as I have gotten older it has gotten coarser and wavier.</li>
      <li>This shampoo seems to clean well &amp; leave my hair soft when I use it with the Quench conditioner, but it has the distinct color &amp; texture of the remnants of a sinus infection.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo restored my hair to soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I think the shampoo still has too many surfactants, as just a tiny amount foamed up well beyond my liking</li>
      <li>Wife loves it...says it nourishes her hair and sets her natural curls free.</li>
      <li>I had the conditioner first, and used it with another shampoo.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like it cleaned my hair well with first use.</li>
      <li>quite simply, it makes my hair look and feel healthy and conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this products wish I could find locally!</li>
      <li>but when it dried I thought it smelled good.</li>
      <li>After Washing with this, I conditioned with the Ultra Nourishing Conditioner and let my hair air dry.&lt;br /&gt;Upon drying, my hair was much smoother, felt good and moisturized and had less frizz.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I really like very much this product.</li>
      <li>I have long, color treated hair and love the conditioner in this line.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It makes my hair soft, shiny, but it&#x27;s still full of body-</li>
      <li>I finally found the right stylish to cut my hair; next step was to find the right products.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I would love for Dove to change is the smell to bring it down couple of level but other than that this shampoo is working great for me.</li>
      <li>, I PURCHARSE THIS ONE BECAUSE I READ THE REVIEWS, BUT I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to lather, either.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my mom who love to curl her hair and this product did as expected.</li>
      <li>and I have very wavy/curly hair.</li>
      <li>Its big plus is how moisturizing it is (and the &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling you&#x27;ll have afterwards), though if you have thicker/coarser hair you&#x27;ll need to make sure your hair is soaking wet before application.</li>
      <li>It left my hair very soft and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As for the shampoo itself it didn&#x27;t seem to do much but the conditioner really does make your hair soft!</li>
      <li>Towel dry, then use the dove serum after slight towel drying the same way as the Saryna (it&#x27;s good to smooth it through your hair like that b/c it flattens out the frizzies).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The first ten or so ingredients are about the same as any of their other shampoos except they have added several coloring agents to this one  for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small glob of the shampoo lathers up very nicely and does a good job of cleaning my hair.</li>
      <li>also highly, highly recommend the hair masque in this line too.  </li>
      <li>This is a high quality shampoo that can give your hair hydration, body, and maximum curl.</li>
      <li>I am almost ready to go wash my hair with my old shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t that aggressive to the hair like those types of shampoos that leaves the hair squeak clean, dry and tangled.</li>
      <li>A little perfumey for my taste and strong - not a subtle scent.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t bad, but there are others I liked a bit better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like very much this product. It has good smell and abundant lather. It isn&#x27;t that aggressive to the hair like those types of shampoos that leaves the hair squeak clean, dry and tangled. However, I gave four stars because I don&#x27;t think it will last. The amount that came in the tube is small (8.45 Fl Oz) compared with other brands.  Loreal has a good line that offers more (12.6 Fl Oz) for the same price. Dove Quench is a good shampoo for those who have very dry hair, or chemically treated hair, or those who dye the hair. However, it is pricey for the little amount of shampoo in the tube.</li>
    <li> It seems that I have waited all my life for this product. Now DOVE don&#x27;t go discontinuing this like you sometimes do!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it, since I have it, but it&#x27;s not great and leaves my hair dry, stiff, and crinkly the next day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Works well, defines my curls.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, thick and coarse. Somehow this shampoo and conditioner made it thicker and coarser, the complete opposite of what I was hoping for. Also, the scent is overpowering. Two thumbs down and the search continues.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it...says it nourishes her hair and sets her natural curls free.</li>
    <li> Love this products wish I could find locally!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this shampoo.  It has a mild, pleasant scent - much like Nexxus brand products.  Its big plus is how moisturizing it is (and the &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling you&#x27;ll have afterwards), though if you have thicker/coarser hair you&#x27;ll need to make sure your hair is soaking wet before application.</li>
    <li> My hair used to be fine and straight, and as I have gotten older it has gotten coarser and wavier. I get a lot of frizz even though i almost never use heat products at all - but I do color it, which I know is harsh. I love this shampoo! I personally liked the smell, and was happy with the thickness of the product - but the color was a tiny bit strange. An odd brownish color. I would have preferred a different color, but that really is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> Horrible, horrible scent. This is unbelievable that such an obnoxious stench would be included in this product. My wife gave it a try but in a short time she had to wash her hair again with a pleasant scented shampoo. The Dove took a dive into the trash barrel. Phew.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry and frizzy and I have lots of it. After reading the ingredients on the back of the tube, I didn&#x27;t have much hope for this. It looked similar to every other shampoo. But I gave it a shot. After Washing with this, I conditioned with the Ultra Nourishing Conditioner and let my hair air dry.&lt;br /&gt;Upon drying, my hair was much smoother, felt good and moisturized and had less frizz.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does have a strong smell. I didn&#x27;t like it when I was washing my hair but when it dried I thought it smelled good. A little perfumey for my taste and strong - not a subtle scent.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo.  Although the bottle says it is for coarse curly hair, and I have the opposite of that:  I have superfine, soft, thin curly hair.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair really frizzy and limp, not good for my coarse curly hair.</li>
    <li> I think it did enhance the curl in my hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo seems to clean well &amp; leave my hair soft when I use it with the Quench conditioner, but it has the distinct color &amp; texture of the remnants of a sinus infection.  Sorry, but it totally does.  It&#x27;s not even remotely enjoyable to use.  I&#x27;ll rebuy the conditioner, but not this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Great product. I bought this for my mom who love to curl her hair and this product did as expected. My mom said she love it and will def recommend it</li>
    <li> just another shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo comes out beige and looks a bit different than most shampoos to me, but I LOVE the lather.  It is creamy and very rich.  The lather just feels luxurious.  It contains Mauritia flexuosa fruit oil, which is a type of palm oil that is loaded with oleic acid and antioxidants like vitamin C.  It is very good for hair, and its presence probably explains the shampoos brownish color.&lt;br /&gt;While it is advertised for course, curly hair, I like it for my extra long, hip length fine hair.  NOTHING has really been better, short of Alterna, which is $50 a bottle and too expensive for me to use all the time.  I suppose because the ends of extra long hair get like straw, and this really moisturizes the hair and smoothes the cuticle.  One use and I was hooked, but I thought it if I kept using it, it might make my scalp or the hair closer to my head oily, but nope, I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, every 2-3 days, and it is just great.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair soft, shiny, but it&#x27;s still full of body- quite simply, it makes my hair look and feel healthy and conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also highly, highly recommend the hair masque in this line too.  Used togther, they will bring new life back to dry, damaged, or &#x27;old&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> I been using this shampoo for the last 6 weeks is working great my wavy hair is alive again is not dry , frizzy or dead anymore. The only thing I would love for Dove to change is the smell to bring it down couple of level but other than that this shampoo is working great for me.</li>
    <li> I like the Dove Advanced Hair Series Ultra Nourishing Shampoo. It&#x27;s easy to work up a rich lather, cleans well and rinses off easily. I use it together with the matching [[ASIN:B00R0UK878 Dove Advanced Hair Series Ultra Nourishing Conditioner]]. Upon drying, my hair feels soft and smooth, apparently with less frizz. The shampoo has a rather strong scent. It&#x27;s not unpleasant but not great neither. I wish the scent was a tad milder since I didn&#x27;t really enjoy it in the shower. At least it went away quickly after rinsing off.</li>
    <li> This is a nourishing shampoo that repairs dry curly hair. It is designed to make hair as much as four times curlier than before regular use. This is a high quality shampoo that can give your hair hydration, body, and maximum curl.</li>
    <li> The best on the market</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it....the smell is wonderful..</li>
    <li> It does have a strong smell I personally think it smells good however some will disagree with me. As for the shampoo itself it didn&#x27;t seem to do much but the conditioner really does make your hair soft! I have long think curly hair and I wash my hair every other day using the set and my hair definitely comes out softer!</li>
    <li> This is a very good shampoo that lathers up great with only a small amount. The scent is typical of Dove products. Personally, I find it a bit cloying, but not enough to turn me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great for my hair, but I don&#x27;t expect a shampoo to work miracles.</li>
    <li> I like the product but have only used it once since I purchased it, so it may take some time to see if I get good results.</li>
    <li> The scent is nice, but it&#x27;s a bit on the strong side. If you don&#x27;t mind that or don&#x27;t have a sensitive nose then you&#x27;ll probably be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy hair that dries out pretty fast. So far this has left it feeling really soft and shiny. I only wish the bottle was larger because it already feels like I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle even though I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week. Maybe only use it for your dry ends if you have medium to long hair like I do. Otherwise you&#x27;ll be burning through your wallet way too quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not going to impact your lifestyle one way or another.  Of course the advertisers tell you it will but don&#x27;t they all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first ten or so ingredients are about the same as any of their other shampoos except they have added several coloring agents to this one  for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small glob of the shampoo lathers up very nicely and does a good job of cleaning my hair. It left my hair very soft and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tube was very lightly scented and didn&#x27;t leave a scent in my hair after rinsing.  Maybe the fragrance all went in another batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this shampoo is as good as most especially at this price point.The 8.5 oz. tube should last a long time with normal use.</li>
    <li> The first thing you notice about the Dove Advanced Series Ultra Nourishing shampoo is the creamy, yellowish color and strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care for the scent but at least it doesn&#x27;t linger. I have long, color treated hair and love the conditioner in this line. But I was less impressed with the shampoo. It is ok and lathers up well but my hair just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean when using it. I guess I am just used to clarifying shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have very long straight fine hair, not exactly the target of this product. However after 2 weeks in full sun at 6,000 feet, my hair was very dried out. This shampoo restored my hair to soft and smooth. It has rich lather and a gentle pleasant fragrance. The results were great shiny hair with no flyaways. Very gentle support for even my fine hair. I&#x27;d definitely buy this when my hair has been sun or wind damaged.</li>
    <li> I like the scent and wanted to love this product, but this dried out my hair making it more unruly and difficult to style. It has been relegated to the guest bathroom emergency stock.</li>
    <li> My daughter has really curly hair that tangles easily bc it is so silky. This worked great for her hair &amp; I have already ordered more.</li>
    <li> Works fine but it the fragrance is way too strong</li>
    <li> I love this it really work well for my curl. It&#x27;s like medecine for curly hair. :D</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see too many affordable shampoos in tubes these days.  Tubes are great to take on trips as they pack easier than bottles and are more pliable in a shower bag.  This shampoo has a golden hue to it.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to lather, either.  It has a subtle fragrance that dissipates once the hair is dry.  It contains conditioner, which makes my shoulder-length hair silkier without being matted.</li>
    <li> I have coarse, thick, dry 3b curls.  It is difficult to find products that moisturize my hair and then allow the curls to hold their shape without making my hair frizzy (from too little product) to crunchy (from too much product).  I finally found the right stylish to cut my hair; next step was to find the right products.  I was excited to see this Dove product line commercial because the girls actually looked like me, and looked like they had natural curls (c&#x27;mon; some of those John Frieda gals ain&#x27;t got the natural curls.)  Anyhow, I had been using super expensive products that worked well, but didn&#x27;t fit in my budget because with thick, long, coarse hair, you use a lot of product.  A LOT.  Like, everything should come in 1L tubs.  Anyhow, I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere (I live in a major metropolitan area, so Wally World isn&#x27;t an option) so I ordered the entire product line online.  First of all, this smells WAY better than the expensive stuff I&#x27;ve used.  I think the shampoo still has too many surfactants, as just a tiny amount foamed up well beyond my liking (I equate foam with surfactants and surfactants with drying; I tend to only shampoo every other shampoo and use a conditioner rinse on the days I skip).  The restoration mask was a dream - I normally use a mask once a week, and this was just as good as the expensive one I used.  Conditioner equally fantastic.  The major test was going to be the creme serum.  Again, the results I got were phenomenal.  I&#x27;m definitely adding this to my routine; however, the minus one star is for a few things:  1) the product MUST come in larger bottles.  I go through product way too quickly for these tiny containers, which leads me to 2) please have this available in more stores!  I&#x27;d hate (sorta) to only be able to get it through Amazon (and no, as of two days ago, you can&#x27;t order it on Wally World&#x27;s website and 3) the shampoo needs to be less stripping.  Otherwise, I will add this to my routine.  I think it is important to still use a good leave in -conditioner I use Saryna Key Curl Control Leave in Moisturizer (squeeze your hair out after you shower and section hair off into 4 chunks, and squoosh in with your hands from root to tip like you were flattening your hair out).  Towel dry, then use the dove serum after slight towel drying the same way as the Saryna (it&#x27;s good to smooth it through your hair like that b/c it flattens out the frizzies).  Use a bit of Taliah Waajid curly curl cream at the tips to scrunch through your hair, and let air dry (if you can).  My hair has never been this shiny or touchable - it also smells far better than some other more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I have Caucasian very long thick loose curls. My hair gets dry and frizzy. I don&#x27;t use a lot of product in my hair. I didn&#x27;t love the shampoo. I didn&#x27;t feel like it cleaned my hair well with first use. The conditioner felt nice and I let it sit in for a few minutes. The true test would be as it dried. My hair holds water for hours when I let it air dry. Finally as it was about 75% dry I looked it the mirror and my hair was considerably less frizzy then my previous shampoo and conditioner. I added a bit of coconut oil and I&#x27;m happy to say the frizz is well tamed. The biggest problem I have is the horrible headache I&#x27;ve had all afternoon after using this product. I wish the parfume wasn&#x27;t so strong. We&#x27;ll see if I can get use to it.</li>
    <li> After using both the conditioner and shampoo, my hair is very dry and does not curl very well.  I do not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I HAVE CURLY HAIR AND IT IS HARD TO FIND THE RIGHT PRODUCT FOR MY HAIR, I PURCHARSE THIS ONE BECAUSE I READ THE REVIEWS, BUT I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell at all!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry curly hair. When I opened the bottle I was overwhelmed by the smell of the shampoo. I powered through the smell to see if it would help my hair. The results were great, I could finally get a brush through my hair without tugging!  But the stench of cheap perfume is lingering and giving me a migraine.  I am almost ready to go wash my hair with my old shampoo.  I tried to leave feedback of the dove site, but couldn&#x27;t see where to do it.  This would be a great product if they removed the terrible smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo together with the matching conditioner and it&#x27;s a great duo. The shampoo makes my (very damaged) hair soft, similar to the results I get using a two-in-one shampoo that has conditioner. However my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy looking as quickly with this Dove shampoo as it does with shampoo that also has conditioner in it.  My hair maintains it&#x27;s fullness, so the shampoo doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all. But it does a great job of softening my hair as if it had a conditioner in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I found that I like the matching Dove conditioner quite a bit more, when I use it with this shampoo. I had the conditioner first, and used it with another shampoo. Then when I received this shampoo, I started using the two together. The conditioner compliments how the shampoo works. So now I love how the conditioner works, after trying it with the shampoo. Used separately, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with the conditioner. It wasn&#x27;t bad, but there are others I liked a bit better. But using these two Dove products together, I&#x27;m loving how well it works for my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ll be natural for a year in May and I have very wavy/curly hair. My edges and ends are coily curls while my hair is like wavy waves but it&#x27;s very dry. I needed something to use in my hair that would give it tons of moisture. I sometimes use Wen which is FANTASTIC but EXPENSIVE. So I tried to find something that would give me Wen quality on a drugstore budget. This shampoo made my hair feel kind of dry, I didn&#x27;t like it. The conditioner is phenomenal though.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try a new product on my curly hair, but was quite disappointed after actually using this. I purchased the shampoo and the serum; both smell awful and it is a strong scent. It&#x27;s not a scent I can get over, either. The shampoo also seemed to dry out my hair more than my usual shampoo, and it made my hair hard to style after using it.  I will not be purchasing these products again.</li>
    <li> I have previously used just about everything out there, including pantene pro-v for curly hair. While this is a little more expensive, it&#x27;s worth it! I can go two days without having to wash my hair and the curls stay so much more defined. I personally like the smell (saw that some people complained about it). My hair is soft, curly, and manageable.</li>
