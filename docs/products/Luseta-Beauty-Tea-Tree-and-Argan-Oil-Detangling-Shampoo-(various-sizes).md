<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the scent of this product. It is very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; with a menthol/eucalyptus aroma. It&#x27;s a welcome change from the &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; scents or the &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; scents. This is one of those unique scents that I find very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo performs very well. It&#x27;s very thick, offers loads of lather, but still rinses out without leaving a residue. It leaves behind a light, nice scent -- it&#x27;s there, but it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you.  My scalp in particular feels very clean after using this, which is not usually the case with the ultra-thick premium shampoos. They usually leave me with a residue-like feeling on my scalp. This, in contrast, leaves my scalp feeling clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is not as appealing to me as the shampoo, mainly because the shampoo is so nice that a conditioner is really not needed. But, if you have extra dry or damaged hair, this conditioner will help out tremendously.  To give it a fair evaluation, I gave the conditioner to my sister who has very hard to manage hair (plus damage due to coloring). She was very pleased with it, and said it provided excellent manageability, but still rinsed out with leaving a greasy residue feeling.  She also was a big fan of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem was the packaging, especially with the shampoo. It has a plunger nozzle but the plunger didn&#x27;t dispense the product. You could press and press the plunger but little came out of the nozzle, with a good deal more oozing out around the base of the plunger shaft. Normally a malfunctioning dispenser is not a big deal, but given the price point of this product, a better quality dispenser should be part of the deal.  I ended up decanting the shampoo into another bottle to make it possible to use without having to unscrew the top cap. The conditioner pump worked better, but even that was not mess-free. I don&#x27;t think it was a shipping problem since the box it came in was undamaged, and it was well-packed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I am tempted to drop my rating due to the poor dispenser, I&#x27;ll keep it at five stars since the product itself is excellent. It&#x27;s not cheap, but it is one of the more unique shampoos I&#x27;ve come across, and it performs very, very well.  Hopefully, a better quality dispensing method will be used in the future.&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided for review]r /&gt;Although I am tempted to drop my rating due to the poor dispenser, I&#x27;ll keep it at five stars since the product itself is excellent.

    <li> I am not joking when I say that this Tea Tree and Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner by Luseta has become a real favorite of mine. I’m glad I was introduced to this product when I was given an opportunity to review this product for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I’ve used various shampoos/conditioners.  I have a couple of go-to preferences, mostly salon brands, but most I have tried have been disappointments. I’m not a fan of shampoos that smell like heavy perfumes and I prefer a more natural smell. This one from Luseta smells like leafy mint and makes your scalp tingle pleasantly. My hair’s luster is a bit shinier when I finish and it’s easy to brush without hairs falling even when my hair’s wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve read some of the critical reviews about this product on Amazon and have noticed that their reasons for giving this product a negative review is about the fragrance or how Argan oil doesn’t actually give your hair any benefits when it’s washed out. I suppose that is their opinion, but I happen to really like the minty fragrance of this hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the benefits of Argan oils and other oils contained in this shampoo, there is something called conditioner where even though you rinse most of it off, many of the nutrients and oils do get absorbed into your hair during application and the short wait before you rinse. The shampoo cleans your hair and removes odor, dirty particles, and allergens from your hair while the conditioner gives your hair the moisture and natural oils that it needs. The tea tree also treats your scalp and prevents dandruff. This shampoo and conditioner does not contain sulfates although it does contain sodium chloride and dimethicone. It lathers well and leaves your hair smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would compare this shampoo to Paul Mitchell’s Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner. This set by Luseta is slightly cheaper for a larger volume. The fragrance and the benefits are similar, though I suppose Paul Mitchell is a more well-known name. However, I like this shampoo and conditioner by Luseta just as much as I like Paul Mitchell’s tea tree shampoo.owever, I like this shampoo and conditioner by Luseta just as much as I like Paul Mitchell’s tea tree shampoo.</li>
    <li> I just received the combo pack of the Tea Tree and Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner and I must say I am very pleased.  I color my hair at home.  I have learned to use Color-Safe products to extend the color.  I received this set and had to try it first thing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to share that it smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pick up a Mint scent and none of that Tea Tree scent (which I do not like).  I have hair that is about 3.5 feet long so it took about 4 pumps of the shampoo to get a rich lather and about 4 pumps of conditioner to cover my hair fully.  With my colored hair, I tend to find my hair feels dry after shampooing and before conditioning.  I was surprised to note that after rinsing the shampoo out, my hair felt good and not dry or sticky!  I left the conditioner on for about 3 minutes before rinsing.  My hair is shining and feels soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it long enough to let you know if it improves my hair but I will update this review if I see a notable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complimentary sample provided for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Sample provided for evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair that can be a bit temperamental at times. It&#x27;s dry due to sun, surf and swimming so the perfect time to try out a new shampoo and conditioner, which I was willing to do since I had a coupon for the Luesta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the bottle, I was surprised at the minty scent. I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent of tea tree oil, so I was pleased to find that it is indetectible to my sensitive nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo gives a nice, thick lather with just a small amounts, which is pretty cool since this shampoo is sulfate free. It rinsed cleanly from my hair. The conditioner is amazing. It&#x27;s thick and made my hair feel sooooo good after using. I didn&#x27;t have any of the annoying flyaway hairs for the first time this summer (and I don&#x27;t use cheap hair products!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with both the shampoo and conditioner and I&#x27;m pleased to see they are both paraben and sulfate free. They don&#x27;t leave an overwhelming scent, just clean and that&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. This was a good purchase that I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy again.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I tried this.  It felt nice and &#x27;tingly&#x27; to the scalp.  It smelled to me like Tea Tree Oil and a hint of mint.  It smelled nice without being overpowering which is important.  The shampoo seemed to clean my hair nicely and the conditioner left it soft but not greasy.  The bottles that it comes in are very stylish and the pumps seem very sturdy and work well.  They were packaged well, and taped shut to reduce the chance of leakage during delivery. Over all I was very happy with the shampoo and the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife also tried the shampoo and conditioner and provided feedback. She has naturally curly/naturally dry hair. She was pleased with the way her hair felt afterwards; very clean, but still soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall we are both very happy with this product.  I have included pictures of the bottles and pictures of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> My wife buys all sorts of hair products, usually Paul Mitchell, but we were offered these for free and I convinced her to test them out. With trepidation she&#x27;s been using these the last couple days instead of her regular shampoo. I just got her feedback and she absolutely loves the products. I used them as well, but I have very little hair so what do I know? Here is the feedback she gave me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ The shampoo is the perfect thickness. It&#x27;s thin enough where it&#x27;s easy to spread over her hair without using too much product but not so thin that it&#x27;s just falls on the ground.&lt;br /&gt;+ She was worried about the conditioner at first because it appeared oily and she thought it would weigh her hair down. After using it for a few days she says it hasn&#x27;t weighed her hair down at all, in-fact just the opposite. Her hair feels light and soft, not oily.&lt;br /&gt;+ It smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- She didn&#x27;t like initially that conditioner felt thick and oily. She thinks if you have thin hair you should use a small amount. If you have thick hair it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall we&#x27;re very happy with these hair products and will continue to use them in the future.</li>
    <li> This review is for the 16 oz. shampoo and conditioner set.  I will provide some comments about both the shampoo and the conditioner separately, as well, so if you are interested in either of those individually, hopefully this will be helpful to you, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using both the shampoo and the conditioner for a couple of days now and I am generally happy with them.  First, a brief description of my hair and washing habits so you can see how you compare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist-length color-treated hair that tends to be somewhat dry (and, unfortunately, frizzy).  I wash and condition my hair every day (in the evening) and I let it air dry.  It is naturally somewhat wavy (though only about a 2A on the curl scale, if you&#x27;re familiar with that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers pretty well despite being free of sulfates.  I feel that it is doing a good job at getting my hair clean, which is important since I generally use it after heavy workouts.  The tea tree and other oils help my hair to smell good, as well.  The scent, overall, is just clean, for lack of a better way to describe it.  It&#x27;s not overly perfumed or cloying.  It rinses out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner coats my hair well.  My hair does not absorb it as it does with some 100% natural conditioners.  I actually sort of prefer the coating I get with this product because it makes it easier to tell that I have applied product to the full length of my hair.  It rinses out without leaving any residue, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not see the ingredients for either on the product page so here they are (please note I have removed scientific names because sometimes Amazon&#x27;s filters have a problem with those):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo: Water, Sodium Cocoyllsethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide MEA, Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Glycol Distearate, Parfum, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Polyquaternium-10, Tetrasodium EDTA, Argan Kernel Oil, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Lavender Oil, Peppermint Oil, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, CI 19140, CI 42090&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner: Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Steartrimonium Chloride, Paraffinum Liquidum, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Parfum, Amodimethicone, Tetrasodium EDTA, Argan Kernel Oil, Murumuru Seed Butter, Lavender Oil, Peppermint Oil, Citric Acid, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, CI 19140, CI 42090&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So these are free of sulfates, making them suitable for color-treated hair.  Please note that they do both contain silicones (i.e., dimethicone) and that the conditioner additionally contains a petroleum-derifed ingredient (paraffinum liquidum or mineral oil).  Although mineral oil does not work with my skin, it seems to be doing well with my hair.  But I know some people choose to avoid such ingredients, so I have included the list in the interest of full disclosure.  This contains some colorants and both products are a light teal/blue.  I appreciate that the shampoo and conditioner can be purchased separately as well as a set, because I always use way more conditioner than shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, results.  I follow up with a detangling spray (have been using \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; Miracle Leave-In product lately) while my hair is still wet.  And my hair is, with this combination of products, very soft and shiny.  Frizz is reduced, as well.  And this seems to bring out my natural waves.  Please note: it took a couple of days for me to see these results.  So don&#x27;t give up if you have problems after one or two uses.  I&#x27;ve been using this for around a week at this point and really only started seeing the difference in the past few days.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.vender Oil, Peppermint Oil, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, CI 19140, CI 42090&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner: Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Steartrimonium Chloride, Paraffinum Liquidum, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Parfum, Amodimethicone, Tetrasodium EDTA, Argan Kernel Oil, Murumuru Seed Butter, Lavender Oil, Peppermint Oil, Citric Acid, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, CI 19140, CI 42090&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So these are free of sulfates, making them suitable for color-treated hair.

    <li> Excellent packaging. Solid container. Per wiki, World-wide, it is gaining a reputation both as an ingredient in high-end, personal-care products and as a heart-healthy gourmet product. In cosmetics, argan oil is advocated as moisturizing oil, against juvenile acne and flaking of the skin as well as for nourishing the hair. This oil has also medicinal uses against rheumatism and the healing of burns ... Externally, argan oil is used ... for hair as brilliantine, to fortify and ... in the treatment of wrinkled or scaly dry skin. Tea tree oil (TTO), or melaleuca oil, is an essential oil with a fresh camphoraceous odor and a color that ranges from pale yellow to nearly colorless and clear. Tea tree oil is toxic when taken by mouth,but is widely used in low concentrations in cosmetics and skin washes.Tea tree oil has been claimed to be useful for treating a wide variety of medical conditions. It shows some promise as an antimicrobial. Tea tree oil may be effective in a variety of dermatologic conditions including dandruff, acne, lice, herpes, and other skin infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This packaging is very good and has a flavor. Unlike chemical shampoos, this will give a different experience when used in baths. I was provided a sample in exchange of a review.</li>
    <li> With processed hair that is fine and fragile, I&#x27;m always on the hunt for good conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to trying this duo, I would have said that the conditioner is the main (mane, ha ha!) event, the shampoo isn&#x27;t as important.&lt;br /&gt;A healthy pump of pearlized Luseta shampoo and a gentle scrub on the scalp and through my hair. Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, after a shampoo my hair feels like straw until the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I checked the bottle to make sure it was shampoo that I used...my hair actually felt smooth and soft instead of parched.&lt;br /&gt;It also felt clean, unlike after using that famous almond/mint stuff hawked on TV.&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree products can often smell too strong and medicinal, but with this that scent is tempered with a touch of lavender. You can smell tea tree but it&#x27;s very spa-like, not medicinal.&lt;br /&gt;Next the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing it out, my hair felt as if I did a deep conditioning masque, but without the greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that it&#x27;s dry, my hair looks and feels great, well, as great as my damaged hair CAN look. Smells fresh and clean. Not perfumey or medicinal, just clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this shampoo and conditoner from Luseta, and I really like it. No one product is right for everyone, but it works beautifully on my hair.</li>
    <li> If you do not like minty things, you probably won&#x27;t like this. I love the smell of mint and these do smell of peppermint! Some of the oils used are Argan, tea tree, lavender and peppermint. A nice blend of amazing scents and possibly the best ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I applied the shampoo into my hair, it was very minty and refreshing. My head felt cool and refreshed. I love how both bottles have pumps to make it very easy and accessible in the shower. The conditioner had the same scent and blue color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural hair-never have colored it and it is very long (almost to bottom). Once out of the shower, I let it air dry and my hair was incredibly soft and shiny! It was easy to brush my hair and not a hassle with the tangles I usually have. I couldn&#x27;t notice a difference of repair, as my hair is not really damaged or dry, but it left my hair looking beautiful and hydrated. I enjoyed having this treatment on my hair and plan on continuing to finish the shampoo and conditioner. I received this shampoo and conditioner for testing purposes during a promotional launch to provide you with an honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few months now, and I like it. It leaves my hair with natural oils still present, which give it plenty of body compared to some products I&#x27;ve used in the past. I received a sample to review, and will be purchasing it when the time comes to refill.</li>
    <li> I have been using tea tree leave in conditioner for years after a visit to my barber shop and he put some in my hair after my cut. It left my head all tingly and it just felt food. After that I have purchased it probably about 4 bottles of it. I love it. So when I got the chance to review this Luseta Tea Tree &amp; Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner I didnt think twice about it. It is perfect. The same exact smell and now I can wash and condition in the shower with it, not just rub in the leave in conditioner. I have been using it for the past 4 days now and I have had no drying of the scalp. I get dandruff easy..always have. So I cannot by any means use cheapo shampoos...so this is a plus for me. No dandruff at all. It gives me that fresh clean minty tingly feeling the leave in conditioner gave me. The smell is just clean..Not fruity or perfumy..I&#x27;m a guy so that is a plus too. I have some very expensive &amp;#34;guy&amp;#34; shampoo that gives me dandruff bad. Cant use it and can&#x27;t return it. This on the other hand has been perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After buying the leave in conditioner for so many years I have no doubt I will be buying more of this. My wife and both love it. I was surprised with her because she has hair down to her waist and is super thick..she is very particular about her shampoos so I wasn&#x27;t even sure if she would use it. She came out this morning and said she tried it and loved it. Left her hair silky smooth and was easy to get out even with her thick long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Luseta Tea Tree &amp; Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is getting 5 stars from us guys..Perfect!! Although we did get this for review purposes I see my wife has already added it to our Amazon Wishlist...So we will be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe &amp; Happy Shopping!!&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample product to test and evaluate.

    <li> I am in love with this shampoo and conditioner.  Most of the Argan oil shampoos and conditioners have a scent that I&#x27;m not exactly in love with.  This shampoo and conditioner has a lovely minty smell that leaves you feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is great.  I love how with longer hair I only need 2 pumps of the bottle and that&#x27;s enough.  The shampoo suds up and cleans my hair really nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner also has the minty scent.  It was thicker and was harder to use the pump with.  However, 2 pumps was still the perfect amoun for my hair.  It didn&#x27;t leave my hair super silky feeling as I rinsed it out.  However, after my hair dried it was amazingly soft and I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair.  It also left my scalp feeling tingly and warm from the mint.  It was an interesting feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free in exchange for my review.</li>
    <li> The Luseta Tea Tree &amp; Argan Oil shampoo and Conditioner are awesome. I never used any tree tea shampoo or conditioner before. So it was my 1st experience and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice box. The bottles which contain the shampoo and conditioner are luxurious. I got 16.9 oz ones.&lt;br /&gt;The Shampoo and conditioner have pump bottles. Which are easy to dispense the product.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner have nice minty scent. It is in light green mint color. It cleanse the scalp and nourishes the hair.  On the scalp it feels refreshing and tingling. It lathers well. It leaves the hair clean, smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner have Argan oil which is awesome for hair. It makes hair smooth, shiny and soft. Another great thing I have noticed that since I am using this shampoo and conditioner I have less hair fall. My hair become tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;These products are awesome to repair the split ends and leave moisture in hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with these products. I would highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I got the opportunity to try these products in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I used these for the past three days and my hair feels pretty darn good. The tea tree oil is somewhat soothing but at least I don’t throw any reaction to it as I have done some shampoos and the conditioner leaves my hair nice and soft without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My life hasn’t changed from using this… butterflies don’t gather around me when i walk outside but it&#x27;s is a nice shampoo and conditioner which I will continue to use in rotation with some others. FWIW the scent is very mild which i like it is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hair products are entirely personal so I can only tell you it works for me and noticed they sell a really cheap $5 set for a trial so try it out first it might be your thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Product provided for review - its just my opinion</li>
    <li> I love using tea tree oil for my hair and now I have this awesome tea tree and argan shampoo with conditioner. My hair feels even better. This set comes with shampoo and conditioner 16 oz. I have short hair so this will last me a very long time.  There&#x27;s many benefits to using tea tree, this shampoo will leave your hair smooth and shiny. I love how it smells I know some hate it but I love it. I also love the fresh feeling on my scalp. The conditioner leaves my hair so smooth and untangles it.  Tea tree oil helps cleans and remove impurities I&#x27;m so happy this shampoo contains tea tree. My hair feels and looks so much better. I will continue to use this shampoo and conditioner.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I come late to this review but since taste is subjective, I find myself disagreeing with the 5 star reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;My wife, daughter in mid-twenties and I have tested the shampoo and conditioner for about a couple of weeks. We came up with the same conclusion; we like the initial tingling effect and the fresh minty fragrance of the shampoo. The conditioner washes off easily and quickly with no residue. My wife likes the fact that there are no sulphates in the products.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Both products are “thin” in density when compared to well established high-end brands.&lt;br /&gt;A relatively large amount of shampoo is necessary to get a full head lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the Luseta Tea Tree &amp; Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner is a good product and well priced for an average quality. I would not hesitate to use it if my regular hair products were not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a coupon to purchase this item, but with no obligation to write a review. This is not a barter deal. I have no financial or personal connection with the manufacturer, seller or their employees.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t normally use or really need the deep cleaning or repairing of my hair I do like the smell and feel of my hair using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying I feel like it is massively cleaner or has more \\&quot;luster and vitality\\&quot; than previously but I also do not dislike the feel. No residual feel from using it of any buildup, not a hard to rinse out product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose just because I do not feel or see much of or any real difference the abilities of the oils used are still performing their intended functions which is good...better though if it were more apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When someone spends the amount this type product costs they don&#x27;t want to know it is doing something they want to see and feel it is doing something AND know it too. I just don&#x27;t notice anything that really stands out with this product (except the minty smell). I would expect a very concentrated product that uses only a small amount yet produces a large amount of thick foamy lather. It is not thick and doesn&#x27;t really count as lather in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe amuch longer term usage is required to really see the benefits, for now it is just a nice smelling shampoo and conditioner. It pretty much smells like minty fresh toothpaste, not a bad thing except I think people want their mouth and not there hair minty fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again I do not dislike this product at all, just not so sure it is worth the asking price from the results. I did not have long hair when I began using it and midway through I went even shorter, nothing changes for me but the slightly lesser amount I am using now. I have naturally \\&quot;good\\&quot; hair I have been told so perhaps to really see the benefits there needs to be a much lower starting point. It is my intent to have my mother use this and then update the review once the results she experiences are conveyed to me (hopefully sometime soon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon rating system... I DO like it, just not enough to purchase it for future use so only 4 stars. If rated on the value alone it&#x27;d be a 2 or 3 star but as a product rating IF you have the income to afford hair care products in this price range and assuming these oils are beneficial then go for it. Myself I think I will stick to the stuff on the local shelves for now at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.rated on the value alone it&#x27;d be a 2 or 3 star but as a product rating IF you have the income to afford hair care products in this price range and assuming these oils are beneficial then go for it.

    <li> This Luseta Tea Tree &amp; Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner is exquisitely wonderful and luxurious.  I’ve recently become enthusiastically obsessed with the aroma of Tee Tree oils.  It is the only scent that I’ve been using in my diffuser and was delighted when given a chance to try this shampoo.  It is all I’d hoped it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the lovely smell this shampoo works better than the high priced “infomercial” brand I’ve recently bought.  It cleans my hair and has no drying effect so it’s shiny and there are no flakes showing up on my shoulders.  I’m well into retirement years so it is important that a hair product does not dry out my already age-compromised hair and scalp.  I’m very happy and pleased that I got a chance to try out a sample of this Luseta product and write an evaluation.  I honestly plan to purchase more.</li>
    <li> This set of Tea Tree and Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner is absolutely wonderful!! Sure the bottles look sleek and professional and the pump dispensary is nice. The real treasure is the contents though! Both formulas smell absolutely amazing and will quickly open up your sinuses so if you are feeling stuffy just head for a shower. My guy loves to be close and is always commenting on how good my hair smells which I absolutely adore. Well, as he was about to head out to work, I walked him out to his car and when he leaned in to hug me he, he was so infatuated with the pleasing fragrance of the oils that he did not want to let me go....I did not object!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length hair and one pump is plenty for me so I feel like these bottles will last me a while. When I first used these I was really impressed with how amazing my head felt during and afterwards as it gives you a cooling effect and is quite relaxing. In all seriousness, I can be outside in this crazy Texas heat and my head will still feel cool! It&#x27;s crazy, yet wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product on my 7 year old daughter and even she mentioned how great her hear smelled and felt claiming that it made her hair very soft and it was easier to brush. Both of us have healthier looking and shinier hair then before so I can honestly say that Luseta&#x27;s Tea Tree &amp; Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner is my new favorite hair product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this set for free to try out and provide feedback, my experience was 100% positive and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> As a guy I have to admit I really never gave a whole lot of thought to what type of shampoo I used.  I figured they were pretty much all the same and have used whatever Costco had available when I needed to restock.  From this very first try with this shampoo and conditioner combination I knew it was a bit different than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the smell which has hints of menthol but smells quite a bit better than the old Vicks Vapor Rub.  I used two pumps of shampoo on my hair and got way more lather than I thought I would.  I rinsed and used two pumps of the conditioner, which has a similar scent to it, and left it on for a bit before rinsing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After towel drying my hair I could feel that my scalp felt cooler than it normally does after a hot shower.  No doubt a result of the oils doing their thing.  I dried my hair and could immediately feel a difference in how soft my hair felt.  For the previous week or so I had been using a bottle of Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo (was late on stocking up!) which really feels like it strips so much from your hair so that may be why I felt there was such a major difference after using this shampoo and conditioner combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a step above the normal drugstore shampoo and conditioners I have been using.  Yes, there is a price difference, but I am sold on the fact that this one does indeed do a better job and is worth the extra money.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I like using tea tree oil in my diffuser so when I had the opportunity to try it in my shampoo with argan oil I was so excited to give it a whirl. I like the smell of the tea tree and when I used the shampoo and conditioner it left my hair feeling so soft and my hair was so shiny. I noticed my hair was a lot more manageable easier to brush. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to lather so be careful and not pour out a whole lot in your hand like you have to some other shampoos. I love the way the conditioner makes my hair feel soft and not that greasy feeling like some of the other brands do. I am so happy that I received a free sample of these for my testing and unbiased opinion. This is my opinion and mine only. I am sure that you will love the way this will make your hair smell and feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using Petal Fresh Moisturizing Citrus &amp; Aloe Shampoo daily for months before being asked by the manufacturer to try this Tea Tree &amp; Argan Shampoo and Conditioner. I&#x27;m certainly no expert on hair care products, but I know the product I was using was drying my hair out too much and leaving it looking dull.  I&#x27;ve been using Luseta Tea Tree &amp; Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner daily for a week now, and here&#x27;s my honest evaluation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luseta Tea Tree &amp; Argan Oil Shampoo&#x27;s has a fresh peppermint scent rather than the typical medicinal tea tree oil scent I was expecting. That was a pleasant surprise because I&#x27;d much rather have my hair smell like peppermint than tea tree oil. The shampoo is a light greenish gel with a thin consistency, and it only took one pump to get a rich lather adequate to wash with.  It felt both cooling and tingly when washing with it and massaging my scalp, and rinsed out easily and cleanly leaving no residue or greasiness. My hair definitely feels squeaky clean after rinsing, and it has a mildly minty scent that lingers. After switching to this a week ago I can definitely feel the difference in my hair texture which now  doesn&#x27;t feel or look as dry or dull. This shampoo seems to get my hair cleaner leaving it with more body when dry than I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t condition every day, but when I did use the conditioner I found it to be a rich cream with the same refreshing minty scent. Once again just one pump was enough to work through my hair and I allowed it to stay in for about a minute before rinsing.  You know how some conditioners are really hard to rinse out and leave your hair weighed down, flat, and sort of oily looking? Not a problem with this one. It rinses out quickly and easily and when I run my fingers through my wet hair it just feels tangle free and clean, not oily at all.  On top of being a terrific detangler, I can definitely see the difference in my hair now. It isn&#x27;t blow away dried out now, it has some gloss back, and feels like it has better body again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare this shampoo &amp; conditioner to high priced salon stuff because I don&#x27;t buy it, but I can honestly feel and see a lot of improvement in the last week in my hair&#x27;s appearance and even in the feel of it. It seems better moisturized than it was when using the &amp;#34;moisturizing shampoo&amp;#34; and sure has a healthier look.  I can&#x27;t say how this shampoo &amp; conditioner will work for you, but it&#x27;s producing very positive results for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retail sample was provided at no cost for consumer product evaluation, testing, and review purposes.ke it has better body again.

    <li> The Luseta Shampoo and Conditioner are nicely packaged in matching brown dispensers. Unfortunately, the fact that the containers are identical except for the word &amp;#34;Shampoo&amp;#34; on one and &amp;#34;Conditioner&amp;#34; on the other makes it difficult to distinguish one from the other when I&#x27;m in the shower without my eyeglasses on. To exacerbate the problem, the product in both bottles is the same scent and color (green). A suggestion to the manufacturer would be to make the &amp;#34;Shampoo&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Conditioner&amp;#34; labels much larger or in a different color ink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always pay special attention to product details when evaluating a complimentary sample such as this one. I really like the fresh organic scent of this product. The tea tree oil scent is sort of minty and sharp and fresh without any chemical overtones. One squirt of the green shampoo is enough to work up a generous lather in my short hair. I try to minimize the amount of shampoo used so that I don&#x27;t spend a long time rinsing it out (to conserve water during the drought). One small squirt of the conditioner is all I need, and it rinses out quickly with no oily residue. I&#x27;m careful not to over-rinse after using the conditioner so that it&#x27;s not thoroughly removed from the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any cosmetic / personal care product, it&#x27;s difficult to validate the claims. It definitely has tea tree oil, and it definitely gets the hair squeaky clean. I don&#x27;t have dry or damaged hair as I keep it quite short, so I can&#x27;t report whether it is helpful in that regard. I color my hair frequently, and these products don&#x27;t seem to cause any more fading of the hair color than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used. So, really it comes down to whether it gets the job done (it does), whether the packaging has utility (could be better), whether you like the scent (I do) and whether the price is right for what you get (rather expensive for a shampoo/conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discounted sample for my trial and review.</li>
    <li> This seems just like a salon product to me, and I&#x27;ve had those around for most of my life because of who I&#x27;ve lived with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably a daily shampoo for those with dry hair, and not the best product for those with oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oils are going to be good for everyone&#x27;s scalp and most will like this product, but I do believe it will be better for those with dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent for testing and evaluation.</li>
    <li> I have now tried this shampoo and conditioner for about a week, that would be about ten times since I do so twice a day. The shampoo&#x27;s scent is overwhelmingly peppermint, since it does contain the oil. The shampoo lathers well and rinses off well, also. The conditioner is rich yet not oily and greasy. They both leave my hair looking and feeling very clean and bouncy. While the ingredients of tea tree and argan oils are great, this does contain Tetra-sodium EDTA, which is more typical of mass market heavily marketed products such as Pantene by P&amp;G. If you are allergic to such chemicals, then you should read the ingredients carefully. If not, this is a very good shampoo in a very nice package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided.</li>
    <li> I color my hair often so I have to make sure that the shampoo and conditioner I am using does not have harmful ingredients that will strip my color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tea Tree &amp; Argan Oil Shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable without removing any of my freshly dyed hair color. The oil shampoo and conditioner are safe to use and smell wonderful even when my hair dries completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels cleans, all of the dirt and bad oil gets removed and replaced by helpful oils that restore my split ends and fight against dry lifeless hair - Great for winter time! My hair has not been so shiny since I was a teenager!! Soft, &amp; easier to brush results - I am very happy with this duo set! Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner set comes in salon-style bottles with pump caps.  Each holds 500 ml or 16.9 fl. oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The are both very thick and pale green.  The conditioner is opaque and the shampoo is translucent.  Both are fairly concentrated, so it is only necessary to use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential oils provide the heady fragrance, which is dominated by peppermint with notes of tea tree and lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both shampoo and conditioner have argan oil as an ingredient and the conditioner also contains butter from the seed of the tropical murumuru palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo makes a good lather and cleans well while the conditioner leaves the hair smooth and prevents tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Komar Beauty provided shampoo and conditioner for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Very nice &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; shampoo. Very smooth and pleasant to use with a nice fragrance that&#x27;s a little minty, probably due to the peppermint oil (in both the shampoo and conditioner). I did not find the fragrance overpowering like with other shampoos I&#x27;ve used. It also cleans and conditions well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does contain &amp;#34;Tetrasodium EDTA&amp;#34; however. There is some debate as to how safe this may be... but my research indicates that the FDA says this chemical is safe to use in foods in limited amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest downside may be the price. If you want cheap shampoo, then this is not it. If you want to be pampered a bit then you may want to give this a try. I think it would also make a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 4.5 stars and rounding up to 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write.</li>
