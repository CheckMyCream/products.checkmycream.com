      <li>Mascara tube doesn&#x27;t look real, packaging does</li>

      <li>The applicator on the other hand, is not my favorite.</li>
      <li>Makes my eyelashes look so full and long</li>
      <li>This product is new for me, just purchased yesterday at Krogers.  </li>
      <li>I have saved an old mascara&#x27;s applicator so I can brush out my lashes and separate them after using this mascara.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying this again because you don&#x27;t have to apply too much to get the desired effect...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give it a 3.5/5 for variety and satisfaction thus far.</li>
      <li>I went back to my old mascara!</li>
      <li>It is the longest lasting mascara I have used so far</li>
      <li>but it is rather weird to have something so strong in odor near my eyes...</li>

<li> just that it has a really weird smell (almost like beer xD), but after a few minutes after applying it goes away.</li>
<li> i think it was out of date...because it got dry in a week, and I use this mascara all the time, never happened before &#x3D;(</li>

<li> Sorry about the silly picture!</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t do the job, very disappointed!</li>

    <li> Great mascara, super dark black, smooth application, lasts all day. Makes my eyelashes look so full and long</li>
    <li> This product is new for me, just purchased yesterday at Krogers.  This morning it did pretty well (I have very long, thin eyelashes). I do not like that it doesn&#x27;t come in waterproof for this variety (not that I was able to find anyway).  It is VERY fragrant, though.  Not a bad smell (almost perfume-like) but it is rather weird to have something so strong in odor near my eyes... I&#x27;d give it a 3.5/5 for variety and satisfaction thus far.</li>
    <li> Works just fine in giving my eyelashes a fuller look.&lt;br /&gt;Its just that it has a really weird smell (almost like beer xD), but after a few minutes after applying it goes away.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite beauty product...It does really full lashes!!!...I Love it</li>
    <li> I believe this may be fake. Mascara tube doesn&#x27;t look real, packaging does</li>

    <li> funcionan muy bien, muy buena compra, gracias por el envio</li>
    <li> Good product and good price. The delivery was on time. The package was nicely wrapped.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this mascara, &amp; I&#x27;ve tried many different brands. Already recommended it to two friends who love it as well.</li>
    <li> This mascara is really good! Definitely gives volume and great length. I like it more than some high end mascaras.</li>
    <li> Sorry about the silly picture! Been using for approximately a year and product has never failed me. They also sell this product at your local target, Walgreens, and Walmart.</li>
    <li> Probably my fault to not check if it is water proofed. But it doesn&#x27;t create the beautiful lashes that I thought it would. And particularly not after one use - after 3 min of applying it again and again you might have nice lashes</li>
    <li> This formula made my lashes brittle which I really don&#x27;t like in a mascara.  Won&#x27;t repurchase, there are much better ones out there.</li>
    <li> Great mascara.  Doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> as shown. comes in sealed package</li>
    <li> This product works great at first but unfortunately dries out pretty quickly</li>
    <li> The mascara is great. The color, the thickness is exactly the way I would want it. The applicator on the other hand, is not my favorite. I have saved an old mascara&#x27;s applicator so I can brush out my lashes and separate them after using this mascara. For me, the applicator doesn&#x27;t separate well enough.</li>
    <li> This mascara is good but i can&#x27;t wear it because it smells so strongly of chemicals.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. Great look--created high volume long lash look without clumps. This mascara lasts all day without smudging or wearing off and removes easily with make up remover or soap and water. I&#x27;m a former Lancôme Definicils user; this product is far better at a fraction of the price. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> My wife does not like this mascara. It&#x27;s clumpy and goopy.</li>
    <li> Leaves eyelashes clumped. I have very full and healthy eyelashes but after using this mascara my eyelashes were falling out ALL day.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!!  Does what is says it will!</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara but it can still be a little clumpy. I just brush the lashes apart while the mascara is still wet and it looks great</li>
    <li> i think it was out of date...because it got dry in a week, and I use this mascara all the time, never happened before &#x3D;(</li>
