<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There&#x27;s a bit of fallout with this shadow. The colors are amazing though.</li>
    <li> happily surprised with this purchased.</li>
    <li> I love this palette. The quality of the shadows ranges, but even the most powdery shadows are better than most drugstore shadows for a drugstore price. There are only a few colors that have had unsatisfactory textures, and they can be a little too soft. None are the kind you have to wipe and wipe and wipe before you get any kind of pigmentation. They&#x27;re all very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This IS a very one-sided palette though. I really like purple, rose-gold, and burgundy shades, but I have found myself wishing for more variety. For that you should check out the Revealed 1 Palette. If you already have a lot of neutrals and are looking to expand the pinkish and purple shades of your collection, this is a great buy</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful palette. Every type of finish you could want. The possibilities are endless! A must for hazel, green or brown eyed women! Love!</li>
    <li> Not exactly lik the naked pallets but can not complain about a $30 savings.</li>
    <li> The colors in this palette are simply gorgeous. The lighter shades work well for daily wear while the dark shades are perfect for a night out or blending with a lighter shadow to create a new hue. Overall great product, highly pigmented and offered at an affordable price compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised with this palette. Never heard of this particular brand but decided to give it a try after watching a recommendation for it on youtube. The colors are really lovely and velvety. The color payoff is good even without primer. The comparisons people make between the Coastal Scents Revealed line and Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked line are pretty spot on. I own a Naked2 palette and the quality is pretty darn close. If you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t shell out the money for UD, these make great substitutes.</li>
    <li> It is good and awesome</li>
    <li> recieved my palette &amp; i LOVE it :).</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, comparable to the other brands similar palette. Quality consistent with coastal scents. Good pigmentation, buildability, some fall out, but not bad. Best results with a shadow primer. ABSOLUTELY worth the money. Every penny.</li>
    <li> Worth of money.  Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Great deal on a great palette!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this palette probably more that the first Revealed palette. I wear pinks and corals often, love shimmers so this is perfect for me. I love how many different looks you can create with this, so many options. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with fallout as long as I didn&#x27;t put a ton on my brush. The colors apply nicely and are nicely pigmented. Not as pigmented as Lorac or UD but for the price I am in no way complaining. I don&#x27;t mind dabbing a little more on if I can save 24 bucks.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colours, very pigmented, love this palette!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get over how awesome this palette is. I use this one more than any other that I have. It&#x27;s such a great value at less than half the cost of naked three. Yet, just as good. Definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love this palette! It was in pristine condition when I received it.</li>
    <li> This pallet is now my favorite! All the colors complement each other and I can get many looks out of it for a cheap price. The shadows blend perfectly together and give you a professional look! Buy it now :)</li>
    <li> Amazing pallet! The price is super low compared to its quality! Soft and buttery and lasts all day! Of course with a great primer/concerler. I absolutely love it! And with this price I am thinking of stocking just incase it ever goes up in price.</li>
    <li> very nice shadows for the price.</li>
    <li> Colors are highly pigmented and blend well. For less than a dollar a shadow this is worth the money. Has the same texture as Urban Decay</li>
    <li> This is such a great palette! Its perfectly dark and I honestly just adore the colors.</li>
    <li> I love love love this eye shadow pallet!! Every color is absolutely beautiful and very good pigments this is just as good well even better then some of the urban decay pallets!!! I want more of these so I&#x27;m wanting coastal scents to make a revealed 3 eye shadow pallet!!! Great colors and awesome quality and the price is just right!!</li>
    <li> My goodness this is better than the best! I was a bit skeptical...boy was I wrong , the colors are amazing and well pigmented. this is value for money especially for those you who are crazy about Naked urban decay and can&#x27;t afford. I would prefer this shadow anytime.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  The colors are very well pigmented and they have a great finish! I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> AMAZING purchase! I have been dying for the naked3 palette, but for the price this was a better option. I was afraid that the eye shadow would fall, not stay on all day. BUT I was so wrong! This stayed on all day, went on lightly so that I could apply intensity to my own taste, and lasted ALL DAY.</li>
    <li> I actualky have nothing bad to say about this product! The eyeshadow lasted for hours and the colors were beautiful!!!! When it came it was packaged soo gorgeous and I just knew I would live it! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The colors are extremely beautiful, love them</li>
    <li> I just love everything about coastal scents and the delivery was on time and perfect</li>
    <li> this is by fare one of my favorite pallets of all times. I am obsessed with this product. very pigmented and builds up great on the eyes.</li>
    <li> I love palettes and this doesn&#x27;t dissapoint. Such pretty colors, great pigment on mostly all the colors. There were about 3 or 4 with big chunky glitter  flakes. Used my fingers to press them on and they worked. Some as buttery as UD, which all my other palettes are from them. Overall GREAT BUY!</li>
    <li> Overall a great pallet. A couple of the colors are chalky but work better wet. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Could not justify paying 53 dollars on the naked 2 palette, so I purchased this instead. Best decision ever!</li>
    <li> i thought some colors were as seen, but they are darker.</li>
    <li> loved my daughter was beautiful on prom.</li>
    <li> Tastes good easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Jason</li>
    <li> This palette was nice and a great price. I wanted a romantic, rosy look for my wedding makeup and this worked perfectly. Some of the colors were hits and some misses. I mainly used the pinkish colors and they were great. The dark colors were harder to work with and blend out. For a bride on a budget, this was perfect!!</li>
    <li> I received my pallet less than the time estimated. Was boxed up well, not damaged.</li>
    <li> These are very shimmery and pigmented. They&#x27;re the colors you would use on a night you want to be elegant and classy.</li>
    <li> Bought this palette based on reviews and YouTube videos. Nice substitution for  overpriced neutrals. Colors are pigmented. A few are chalky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to get my hands on an Urban Decay palette but was always hesitant to shell out so much money. I decided to get this palette instead since I heard good things about it and the price was more reasonable. I ended up really liking this palette since the color payoff is really nice and it doesn&#x27;t feel too cheap. However, the consistency of each color varies. The ones that are shimmery tend to be softer in texture whereas the matte colors aren&#x27;t as soft. But from my experience, that seems to be normal. Yet, the pink toned shade (4th one in the top row) had such an awful consistency that was really powdery and had no pigment at all. When I swatched it on my hands, it seemed to crumble and just leave my hand with shimmers. So I was disappointed to see that it wasn&#x27;t the same quality as the rest of the shadows in this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, I like this palette and I think it was worth the money since these are really wearable colors that can be worn for everyday looks and versatile enough to be used for nighttime looks.</li>
    <li> Basically amazing and perfect. These shadows are highly pigmented, the texture is buttery, the colors are really flattering on my NC15 skin, the price is phenomenal -- what more can you ask for? I&#x27;ve recommended this to all of my friends who were considering buying the Naked palettes. I&#x27;d take this over Naked 3 in a heartbeat. Especially since I&#x27;m not a fan of glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own more than my fair share of high end eyeshadows, yet this is the palette I&#x27;ve been reaching for most!</li>
    <li> Like a lot of the other reviewers, I looked longingly at the Urban Decay Naked palettes but didn&#x27;t want to shell out the purchase price.  Then I sampled this in a Birchbox awhile back and decided to buy the whole set.  I&#x27;m really happy with it.  (These shadows do contain some parabens -- an ingredient that some people avoid -- but I think that&#x27;s the trade-off you make when buying less expensive shadows.  I&#x27;m reviewing these based on performance; the ingredients are listed on the product page and you can make up your own mind about those.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these shadows over an Urban Decay primer (I have oily eyelids and this one works best for me).  I have pretty much only been applying them dry but I find that they last all day and don&#x27;t crease (the primer may be responsible for at least some of that), which is huge for me since I normally get creases by midday.  I&#x27;ve tried blending these and it&#x27;s worked quite well, even though I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience with blending.  I find that this stays put when I&#x27;m putting it on, I don&#x27;t get a lot of shadow on my cheeks/eyelids/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these colors are neutral, there are a lot of reddish/pink tones in there, as well.  (If you&#x27;re looking for more browns, try the original \\&quot;Revealed\\&quot; palette.  I bought both...)  There&#x27;s a nice mix of mattes and shimmers (you can tell pretty easily what&#x27;s matte and what&#x27;s shimmer by looking at the last product image); I&#x27;ve been using both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do note that the dark purple next to the black on the bottom right is REALLY dark.  Be careful when applying that one (it would also probably work as a liner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this and so glad I bought it.  (Please note that you will need to supply your own brushes or applicators as this does not come with any.)</li>
    <li> Loooove this palette!</li>
    <li> Wonderful pigmentation and good for a variety of skin tones!</li>
    <li> I literally use this palette everyday for my natural everyday looks</li>
    <li> i use this nonstop. this is amazing. some of the lighter shades are hard to see, but put a primer under them and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I adore this palette and revealed 1 as well. Great pigmentation, blends smoothly, gorgeous rosy pink colors.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with the quality of this palette. I love my high end makeup but this was recommended to me so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot! So glad I did. This just may be my new favorite eyeshadow and the price is so perfect. They remind me of the Naked palettes from Urban Decay, the pigment and quality is great!</li>
    <li> Some fallout but the pigment is great. It will last all day so long as you pair with a good primer.</li>
    <li> I have never owned one of these palettes but have heard beauty gurus rave about the colors and the pigmentation. I was browsing and saw that they had this palette with more of a range of rosy/gold colors and immediately purchased it. I was not disappointed. The colors are beautiful and the pigmentation is wonderful. They do tend to be on the more powdery side but I can overlook that. It&#x27;s a great deal for the quality and the number of different colors you get!</li>
    <li> First Impression On The Coastal Scents Line. I Absolutely Love The Pallette. The Shadows Are Buttery And Very Pigmented As Well As Having Beautiful Rosie Tones. Perfect For Everyday Looks.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! GREAT COLOR SELECTION!</li>
    <li> Great palette and excellent dupe for the naked 3.</li>
    <li> Love these colours! Great eyeshadows for staters to play around with :)</li>
    <li> Two of the shadows are poor quality but the rest of them are so beautiful, pigmented, soft and easy to blend.</li>
    <li> The shadows blend so well and stay in place very well with no primer. This is a great palette, you will never sorry for purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I use these beautiful eye shadows almost every day. I love this pallette!</li>
    <li> The colors are very pigmented.  It&#x27;s a good palette for the price</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and pretty colors, mostly pink shades and a lot of shimmer</li>
    <li> So pigmented!! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this!!! The colors are awesome! I love the shimmer and matte hues! For 20$ you can&#x27;t beat it!!</li>
    <li> this pallet is awesome!!!!! you wont be disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> I do have this and the Revealed palette and I love them both. The colors are great, and there are so many to choose from! There is very little I don&#x27;t like about this palette. In fact a big pro is it got knocked off my counter and fell to the floor and didn&#x27;t shatter! I do wear primer when I use these colors, mainly out of habit. With primer the color stays all day, and still looks great right before I remove it. I also should note I use drugstore primer so its not even fancy primer. The pigmentation is great on these palettes, and the fallout is minimal. You defiantly get your moneys worth with this palette. I really like all the different looks you can do using the colors they give you.</li>
    <li> I love the colors in this palette! Used with primer, but you could use without for more sheer coverage. Arrived well packaged with no damage to the product. Shipping did take quite a while though, six days to even ship it! Overall, I am happy with it. Much better eyeshadows than the 88 original palette I think.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t pass this palette up! Amazing buttery and highly pigmented eyeshadows. Will definitely be buying the other one!</li>
    <li> I saw this palette featured in several youtube videos and it really reminded me of colors in my naked 3 palette. I have red hair and green eyes,  and these burgundies and warm tones really make my eyes pop. I was really amazed at the quality of these shadows for the price.  I&#x27;m a major eyeshadow snob as my eyes are the only feature that I really like and I put a lot of work into making them look good.  I use the lorac pro palettes most days,  and also use Urban Decay quite a bit. I was very skeptical of ordering this,  but I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, the packaging is very similar to the packaging on the lorac pro palettes. It&#x27;s cardboard,  but great quality. I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple of times and no broKen shadows. It&#x27;s nice and thin which makes it very easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the colors, you get a nice combination of matte and shimmer shades, all of which are highly pigmented and buttery. they blend amazingly well.  One of my favorite things about it is that there are perfect blending and transition colors that make it easy to do the entire look from one palette.  one tip I learned from a youtube tutorial is that the darker brown shade on the bottom row and the cream colored shade on the top row are perfect for contouring the face! I tried it and found that I like those better than the shades in my contouring palette! The formula must be great because even using it for contouring, it hasn&#x27;t broken me out,  and almost everything I use on my face does!  On the face it blends great over foundation for the perfect contour and highlight with no creasing or making dry patches obvious. There are several shades in this palette that are almost identical dupes to the Naked 3. The dupe for Naked&#x27;s blackheart I actually like more!  If you don&#x27;t have the Naked 3 but have thought about getting it,  skip it and get this one. It&#x27;s less than half the price,  you get a lot more color options,  and I honestly just like this one better,  which I never thought I&#x27;d say!!! I have found myself reaching for this palette far more often than any of my other high dollar palettes and I&#x27;ve received a ton of compliments on the days I use it. Super easy to get daytime or night time looks with such a huge selection.  If you&#x27;re reading this you must be thinking about buying it,  so trust me and do it!  You won&#x27;t regret it!  It&#x27;s really that good!d say!!!

    <li> This is perfect dupe for Naked 3. Works like a charm for my skin tone and there are few shades that have fall out but majority of shades have good color pay off and has almost if not all shades from naked 3. My only concern was wish it came with a mirror but can still deal with it for 20$ this is still worth it. Also its easy to buy in amazon for same price as its available in coastal scents website without the shipping fee! There is a good blend of matte, shimmer and sheer shades very versatile and create day time look and also dramatic night time look. Really loved it pallet and would purchase newer versions of it if released.</li>
    <li> Great for the price! Very pigmented. I just wish it had other colors. Majority are pink. I&#x27;ll just have to purchase the other revealed palettes :)</li>
    <li> I enjoy this palate and you get your money&#x27;s worth</li>
    <li> Such pigmentation, great price, and the colors included are beautiful! LOVE!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything all the 5-star reviews say about it. It lives up to my expectation!</li>
    <li> Packaging is a little cheap, but what else do you expect for the price! Great product for what you pay!</li>
    <li> Beautiful pallet!! I love the colors</li>
    <li> Top 2 makeup products I have purchased in years!!!!  I have Green eyes and the red wine colors are so beautiful! !!  I think everyone should own this. The colors blend great. They have shimmer and matte.  Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;Was very impressed with bubble wrapped secured shipping. Shipped on time and not broken.  Buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;Look on my instagram account for photo colors.&lt;br /&gt; blondee_3488</li>
    <li> Just not a great palette, it&#x27;s okay. I used it once. It&#x27;s still sitting in my drawer</li>
    <li> I like it a lot! The colors are pretty, just a little bit chalky. Other than that they blend nicely.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and goes on silky smooth. Such a great price for this palette. Very comparable to the Naked Palettes.</li>
    <li> Love the colors. The shinners shades are the reason I bought it and they are beautiful. Price was awsome too. Will buy again if I go threw it</li>
    <li> As someone who was considering purchasing the Naked 2 or Naked 3 palette by Urban Decay, i&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t and opted for this instead. this has a huuuuge range of neutral and warm toned eyeshadows. only one or two shades in here that I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll use much, but it has the perfect range for me as an every-day palette. I adore the deep red in here, and the taupe colours which are perfect for crease colours and transition colours. I have been reaching for this over my Stila and Mac eyeshadows. And it is soo cheap! I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s only $20! With the naked palette you only get 10, and it costs you over $60! I love my coastal scents Revealed 2 palette. I think it&#x27;s a must-have if you&#x27;re keen on your eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the only major difference between the naked palettes and this, is that this has more colours and a cardboard shell. In saying that, the cardboard is very sturdy and the palette itself has a magnetic close so it won&#x27;t fall open. The shadows sit very securely as well, so i think it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Love the colors. hate that they fade over time and need reapplied. You get what you pay for though.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the colors, they should do a matte one!  I purchase form England Makeup Revolution where, I can get 4 dupes of American palettes for only 30 dollars with shipping and handling!</li>
    <li> These colors are pigmented and not chalky. Goes on creamy.</li>
    <li> This arrived today and it&#x27;s all I expected it to be and more. Super easy to blend and beautiful pigmentation. So happy I bought this instead of dropping $50+ dollars on urban decay&#x27;s naked 3. I have other pallets by urban decay and I have to say, the quality of this pallet is on par and comparable to them. Get it! You will not be disappointed :) I included photos of the pallet and swatches with flash and no flash (indoor lighting). Gorgeous colors!!</li>
    <li> Good product for a reasonable price. Bought this for my girlfriend, who is a makeup geek, and she has no qualms with this pallete.</li>
    <li> The colors are fantastic and so is the pigmentation. The stay on power is pretty dim tho. No matter how much awesome primer I put on the shadows don&#x27;t last the entire day unlike my urban decay shadows.</li>
    <li> I use this one for the office (I am interning at the Rape Crisis Center in my town).&lt;br /&gt; There are more matte shades than in Revealed 1. Counting left to right like reading a book.&lt;br /&gt;Matte: 2,6,11,13,17,18.&lt;br /&gt;Shimmer: 1,3-5,7-10,12,14-16,19,20.&lt;br /&gt;*4 and 10 are glittery and definitely need a primer. 19 is almost pure glitter and metallic, I&#x27;d advise primer on this one too.&lt;br /&gt;All are opaque except number 1.&lt;br /&gt;all are pink based except 1,7,17,18, and 20. The shades all have a cool undertone except 17,18, and 20. So this us a good palletes for people with pink or blue undertoned skin.&lt;br /&gt;1 and 9 don&#x27;t contain as much shadow as the others, as if not enough was put in the pan.</li>
    <li> The colors are so creamy and beautiful. I LOVE that there&#x27;s actually a decent selection of matte blending colors, and I feel that the Revealed 2 palette has a more varied selection of colors than the Revealed 1. Many of the colors on the Revealed 1 palette are almost indistinguishable from one another, but this one has a wide variety and I love all of them! I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> a great versatile palette with a variety of pigmented warm tones!</li>
    <li> Omg the shadows are so pigmented for a everyday use I definitely recommend this palett :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful product. Really impressed with the pigmentation and texture of all the shadows!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Palette!!!!! The colors are so pigmented and gorgeous!!! I do not have the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette but I have other ones and I personally like these shadows better. They glide on with not much effort and little goes a long way!!!! I would highly recommend this palette!!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and so pigmented too! My only complaint is that the pallet has a not so yummy smell, almost like a cheap makeup smell? But I just left mine open for a few days and the smell was gone!</li>
    <li> I love this palette. I am now a former Urban Decay user and have no plans of going back. I can&#x27;t tell a difference in quality between the Naked palettes and the Revealed palettes.&lt;br /&gt;These colors are beautiful, bright and vibrant. I only use an all over primer before I do foundation, no eye primer after and these colors still go on beautifully, last all day and do not flake off.&lt;br /&gt;I must not have paid much attention to how many ounces it said these palettes were because I was shocked by the size. They are pretty big!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with these and are money very, very well spent.&lt;br /&gt;I highly doubt I&#x27;ll be going back to any of the drug store brands or Urban Decay for that matter, they just don&#x27;t compare and couldn&#x27;t compete!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them all but I love the colors they stay put for a long time especially with a primer. Perfect size for traveling. I&#x27;m thinking of getting more to gift friends and family!</li>
    <li> I love them, there are just a few colors have fall out but not to much so there a great!!</li>
    <li> Great colors and texture. Would definately purchase again.</li>
    <li> With every penny. High quality.</li>
    <li> Only one word can describe this pallet, AMAZING !!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, that go on easily and stay throughout the day.  They blend easily and are just so pretty!</li>
    <li> Really good colours. I love this palette! There was no way I was spending $54 on eyeshadows, if you know what I&#x27;m saying!</li>
    <li> This palette... I just don&#x27;t even know where to begin. The colors are great, and so many for the price! And I&#x27;m just really impressed with the quality of the shadows; they&#x27;re soft and buttery, very pigmented, and they blend so easily! I was so excited when I received this on my doorstep that I&#x27;m pretty sure everyone on my street heard me squeal. There are some great dupes here for the Naked 3 palette (which everybody already knows :P) but with double the amount of shadows and less than half the price... they can&#x27;t even be compared in my opinion. There&#x27;s only one shadow that I have trouble with, the fourth one on the first row is just a bit too chunky, has a lot of glittery fallout, and it just generally difficult to work with if you use a brush. If you use your finger it works a bit better, so at least there&#x27;s that. But overall, this was just a great buy! If you&#x27;re interested in not only the naked palettes, but in ANY neutral eyeshadow palette, THIS is most definitely the one that I would recommend!</li>
    <li> As a user of many high-end eye shadow brands, I am extremely impressed by this palette. The colors are highly pigmented and very creamy.  They blend well and create a wonderful look.</li>
    <li> This palette is a fantastic deal.  It&#x27;s almost a perfect dupe for the Urban Decay Naked3 palette (in the review picture, Naked3 is on the left, Revealed 2 the right), AND you get 8 additional colors.  The pigmentation and texture are great.  I&#x27;ve gotten one for myself, and two as gifts for other makeup junkies.</li>
    <li> This palette is amazing.  It has so many lovely colors.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice palette. The eye shadow is amazing, vibrant, and easy to apply. It&#x27;s beautiful. I purchased this after getting a 4-color sample set from Birchbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this palette has more reddish/purple colors than I expected. I expected more brown/tan/bronze. It does have brown/tan/bronze, I just wanted more of those and less red/purple. So I would recommend looking at the zoomed-in image (so you can see each color) carefully prior to ordering. In hindsight I probably would have been happier with the Revealed Palette (rather than Revealed 2) because it seems like it has more browns.</li>
    <li> Could not feel more spoiled, giddy, feminine or satisfied! Love this pallet! Love the way it applies smoothly like velvet. Color lasts long, great pigment. I&#x27;m fairly pale, so that may help. Love it! Proud of this purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this eyeshadow palette. Yes, there is a small amount of fall out when using some of these eyeshadows.  Use an eyeshadow primer/base to prolong the staying power and intensify their pigmentation.</li>
    <li> amazing palette the colors definitely last.</li>
    <li> I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS!!! Seriously.. for 1/3 of the price of another palette you get the same quality and consistensy. I have NOTHING bad to say about this.. I just barely dip my brush and it&#x27;s plenty enough. Thank you Coastal Scents for this.. I will use it most everyday. I also don&#x27;t mind paying $20.00 for a palette without a mirror.. a $30.00 mirror is not needed.. lol ;)</li>
    <li> Love. Absolutely love.  Super pigments- smooth as butter. Every single shade is perfection. I will be buying more often from this company no doubt.</li>
    <li> Definitely a combination of the Naked 2 and 3 pallets without paying over $100 for the both of them. Honestly they are great quality and wear for the price.. can&#x27;t beat $20. There is only one shade that has a lot of fallout and not very good but 1 out of 20.. I&#x27;ll take it! Definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys makeup/loves to do different kind of eye looks. You can get so many different looks out of this pallet! Used it once so far and got so many compliments and the shadows stayed for at least 5 hours.</li>
    <li> Nice! Fast shipping to Germany. Good product and no shipping damage.</li>
    <li> great eyeshadows last for hours and nicely pigmented but u need to use a eye primer for the colors to pop!</li>
    <li> Beautiful pigmentation that wears well.</li>
    <li> Great for smokey eyes and everyday use.</li>
    <li> I purchased both Revealed and Revealed 2 and wow, what amazing shadows. I use NYX milk as a base and put these on. They have amazing color pay off and last all day long. Beautiful eyeshadows, I will repurchase. And I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can not express how amazing this color pay of is. You need very little product and get very little to no fall out. They have some satin, shimmer, and matte. Amazing colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an overall amazing palette.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, looks just like all the Urban Decay Naked palettes in one. I like it.</li>
    <li> I came across this while I was looking at the Urban Decay palettes.  I really wanted the Naked 2 but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend that much money on eyeshadow. I bought this instead and figured that it was only $20. I didn&#x27;t expect much for $20, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  The shadows are well-pigmented and complement each other nicely. They&#x27;re very smooth and buttery and feel higher-quality than you&#x27;d expect for a $20 palette.  Definitely recommend buying.</li>
    <li> Colours are really good. I&#x27;m really satisfied and happy with the product</li>
    <li> Looked at this pallet for awhile on the website.  Got a better deal on Amazon and I love the pallet.</li>
    <li> love the matte colors. very pigmented.</li>
    <li> Amazing pigmentation :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely am in LOVE with this palette! All the colors are beautiful and are highly pigmented and creamy. The mix between metallic, mattes and shimmers are to die for. There&#x27;s only fall out in maybe 2-3 colors in the palette but I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Amazing palette for the price !</li>
    <li> Beautiful palette.  Price is Great also!!</li>
    <li> I have spent a lot of money on other more expensive eye shadows and I have to say this really was very good and such a great value.  I&#x27;m just testing it for the first time today, easy to blend and very pigmented.  There is a nice variety of finishes, some matte some shimmer.  It is a bit powdery when you dip your brush in but just go easy and don&#x27;t pick up too much product right away and you&#x27;ll be fine.  Really I nice buy at a great price.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this palette and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t waste tons of money on a higher end palette with similar colors. The colors go on nicely, easily blendable and buildable. I LOVE the shimmery pinks in this palette. I have many palettes but I&#x27;ve been using this one every single day and ignoring all my others.</li>
    <li> It was just as I expected the colors are great,I love it.</li>
    <li> Great find!! Very pigmented! Love this product!</li>
    <li> This palette is great for anyone with brown eyes.  It really makes them pop.  I love all the colors</li>
    <li> Awesome palette for the price! Amazing dupe for Naked 3. :)</li>
    <li> This palette is truly gorgeous!! Total must have!!</li>
    <li> Love it, the colors pretty, and it is a combination of nake 2and 3.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality palette. The colors are all very pigmented and the mattes are so buttery, not chalky at all! I&#x27;m beyond impressed with this. You pay for the quality of the eyeshadows and that&#x27;s all, no fancy packaging or big mirror.</li>
    <li> Awesome eyeshadows - great dupe for Urban Decay Naked 3 and then some.</li>
    <li> i was hoping this would really be a great dupe for the Naked 3--the colors are still pigmented but I feel like it&#x27;s sort of hard to blend. I ended up getting the Naked 3 anyway</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors. Nice pigmentation. Work great after a good primer. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and goes on silky smooth. Such a great price for this palette. Very comparable to the Naked Palettes. Very affordable.</li>
    <li> Love the colors! And arrived in great condition!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the colors, and I like the variety of matte and shimmery shades.  I wish they were a bit more pigmented.</li>
    <li> VERY BEAUTIFUUUUUUL, I&#x27;M HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I had a sample I received from Birchbox and wanted to get more of the four samples I was running out of. I received the kit and the colors are a little off from my sample. However, I like it, long lasting. I just need to find a different combo of shades.</li>
    <li> I think you could probably do better with regular drugstore brands but this has a lot of color options. Even with primer, I had some creasing going on but nothing too bad. I wish they had some darker colors in there besides the black. &amp; there&#x27;s only a few that are matte. The ones that look brown in the photo are a little more red than I expected.</li>
    <li> Amazing I ordered both&lt;br /&gt;The 1st one &amp; this one.&lt;br /&gt;Did a photoshoot the other day&lt;br /&gt;&amp; I used these two palettes on everyone&lt;br /&gt;(Around 13 people) on all the girls&lt;br /&gt;&amp; everyone had a different style from&lt;br /&gt;Natural to super dramatic from&lt;br /&gt;Kids to grown ups.</li>
    <li> This palette does offer some beautiful colors! Their matte shadows blend beautifully, and are very pigmented! But the shimmers are terrible! Have horrible fall out, don&#x27;t blend as well. But for the cost I wasn&#x27;t to upset. It&#x27;s a decdecent palette for on the go.</li>
    <li> I love coastal scents!  This pallette is absolutely beautiful.  The matte colors are beautiful. And the shimmer colors are GORGEOUS. Cant beat the price. The quality is great. Seriously my favorite eyeshadow ever!</li>
    <li> Fabulous colors! Very pigmented and overall quality is great! I can&#x27;t say how happy this product has made me! All I can say is that tha Naked palletes from urban decay have some competition! Great job Coastal Scents!!</li>
    <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smaller than picture but have lovely colors</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, I feel like the colors don&#x27;t stay on all day, but for the price it is ok</li>
    <li> Beautiful color payoff! I use this very frequently and am very please with this and number 1!</li>
    <li> A couple of shawdows has fall out but overall good product</li>
    <li> Packaged nicely, nothing was broken, really impressed with this palette, so happy I bought.</li>
    <li> I use these probably close to every day but I don&#x27;t think that the color is as lasting as some other brands.</li>
    <li> Colors didn&#x27;t really match the photos, but great product for the price. Colors very similar to the naked pallet</li>
    <li> A great item...something for every one, any occasion.  It like the slim size, I can easily fit it into my bag/tote.  I would like to have had a brush/applicator with this.  Goldie, Saskatchewan Canada</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what or how to say it better from all the other who have submitted a review for this AWESOME eye shadow palette.  I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to order the Reveal 2 palette.  I should have ordered both at the same time.  That&#x27;s what I get...but I&#x27;ll have the Reveal 1 in a few days.  The colors are amazing, high pigment and last all day.  I swear you can&#x27;t beat the price for 20 shades!!!!!!  I did include a pic for this review and I took this after a 10 hr work day....just so you know ;) .</li>
    <li> High quality eye shadows for such a great price. I am absolutely obsessed with these eye shadows I get tones of compliments on them. I get more compliments on these eye shadows than any other shadow I usually buy at MAC and Sephora. I will definitely be purchasing another more of these because the quality is just mind blowing and it easy to blend.</li>
    <li> I love this palate and all its colors! I&#x27;m a black woman with medium skin tone and all the colors enhance my eyes beautifully!!!</li>
    <li> I love this palette! I use a primer first and, with that, they last all day! The colors are great and go on smoothly. I do wish there were a few more matte colors and not as many shimmery ones but, other than that, very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Matte ones are so pigmented. AMAZING AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;The glittery ones you need to build up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this palette for a while so I was super excited to get it.  I have had the palette for a while now and am still just as excited to use it.  for the most part the colors are super pigmented and go on nice.  There are just a couple that I am not the fondest of.  It is a little hard to say which since this palette doesn&#x27;t have names for the different shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light shimmery pink on the top row fifth pot from the left is a bit deceiving.  At first glance you think it would be a great shimmer high light but when going on you can barely even tell there is shimmer in it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bottom row the two purple shimmers forth and sixth pot from the left are also the same.  They look shimmery but when putting on you can&#x27;t tell there shimmery at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those the rest are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the long run I would definitely buy this product again.  It arrived in prefect condition and before the estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> Great pallet! Beautiful colors, go on smooth with good pigment. Amazing quality for a great price!</li>
    <li> Cheap with a high end quality</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. So pigmented, a good mix of mattes and shimmer. A must have in a makeup collection.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m 0-2 when it comes to cheap neutral palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just happened to be browsing a few weeks ago and BOOM -  $9.49. during the latest CS sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very.  Very.  VERY good palette,  with both matte and shimmering shades.  There are one or two shades which are redundant for me (I&#x27;ve pretty much stocked up on every Wet &amp; Wild,  and Maybelline,  to never again need a glittery gold) but despite that I can seriously say that this is - by FAR -  the best drugstore priced neutral palette ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One or two of the shades need a few tries before you&#x27;ll adequately dress up your lids but other than that the shadows apply well,  with better-than-decent colour-playoff and.. no creases.  For me,  at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this time and time again.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have not used it very much but when I have it looks great!&lt;br /&gt;Good price! and Great Quality!</li>
    <li> Best budget friendly palette I&#x27;ve EVER purchased!!! Highly recommend. All the colors (except maybe 2) are very pigmented and blend very well. I love this palette as much as my naked 3!!</li>
    <li> Pretty good, the pigment are very strong and the palette is gorgeous</li>
    <li> If you use a base it will help to keep the color longer. The pigments are nice and shiny. I bought this palette because I am hired for Prom Makeup. The colors are nice and remind me of the Naked Palette but they are a little more dry. I have had it on all day so far and no complaints. Good Price for the amount of neutral shimmers and shades you get!</li>
    <li> Buy this eyeshadow... So in love thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I need a go to eye make up palette for traveling purposes and this seem to do it. I have read good reviews about coastal scents palettes are a dope of naked and lorac eye palette and that&#x27;s  mainly the reason why I bought revealed 2. Another thing I like is the nude and smokey eye look and this palette has the right color combination. When I got this product I thought the palettes are all pigmented but i was wrong. Its a combination of shimmery, satin finish and some pigmented specially the dark colors. Few palettes need to be applied more than twice to get your desired color and look. the packaging is very neat and chic and its definitely something I can bring with me for travel.  Overall experience,  I like it. It&#x27;s not a WOW experience like others have in their reviews but It&#x27;s something worth purse keeping for a price that doesn&#x27;t break your purse.</li>
    <li> I only LIKE these.. I got them to try because I love urban decay&#x27;s naked pallets. They ARE similar, but these feel a little more flakey rather than velvety. However, my sister in law who loves the naked pallets also, actually said she likes these BETTER! So its just a matter of preference I suppose.</li>
    <li> Comparable to Urban Decays Naked 3 Palette, which I don&#x27;t have but use the youtube tutorials of UD for this. Very pigmented, light fall out, love it.</li>
    <li> Not as pigmented as UD or lorac Pro and there is some fall out.  However, for the price, you get good colors and an even distribution of matte and shiny eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful and verg blendable, not as pigmented as others say. I like them, they are just a bit powdery and i have a lot of fallout. A good every day palette, maybe not for special occasions though.</li>
    <li> This palette is awesome.</li>
    <li> this palette is ok..was expecting it to be bigger and with more color in the pan..it reminds me of the naked palettes a little bit</li>
    <li> I am in love with this palette! The colors are all beautiful and can be used daily. Super pigmented shades that can last all day wear. I have been having such a fun time creating fun looks, there are so many you can create! My favorite color is the deep burgundy, absolutely beautiful. I have never owned any of the naked palettes but I know many people compare this item to urban decay. If you&#x27;re like me, a newbie to makeup who wants quality items to practice with but not ready to spend tons of money, I recommend getting this one!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous palette for both price and quality. The colors are gorgeous, pigmented, long lasting and blend easily with no fallout. I have not tried all of the colors, but the ones I have tried (the bottom row mainly) are a thumbs up, for sure.</li>
    <li> so much better than any picture can represent and better than urban decay palette 3 - i get TONS of compliments and when people find out the price they are stupified</li>
    <li> AMAZING palette!!! Colors are super pigmented! Little to no fall out. Creamy/velvety textures. A little goes a long way. I use this almost everyday! And yes, this is my boyfriends account, lol.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been hunting down a way to buy Naked 3 but in a cheaper state (price-wise not quality) you have just found it, dear! I honestly can&#x27;t shell out $54 dollars for Naked 3 no matter how much it is I want it, so instead I looked and looked and looked and oh did God Almighty answer my makeup prayers lol. The minute I opened this palette and swatched these colors I nearly died and the minute that second to black color on the bottom row entered my sight - I can&#x27;t even express what I felt. That color is nearly the same color as blackheart (from Naked 3) and it&#x27;s the color I&#x27;ve been gravitating to most. Okay okay but enough with the comparison to Naked 3, because that&#x27;s not all your here for. Is the quality of this palette good - yes! Just remember that like any other eyeshadow you&#x27;ll need an eyeshadow base if you really want it to stick and stay for a long time. The colors are very pigmented though, they have mostly shimmer shades but a few matte shades as well - enough for you to do a neutral eye look. And let me tell you if this doesn&#x27;t convince you to get it- maybe you should think about the price: $20 for 20 eyeshadows all comparable to the UD Naked 3 palette. I mean honestly- what more are you waiting for?! And if you&#x27;re still not convinced- then girly(or mister) may you be enlightened!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this palette and it can make so may looks ! I recommend this palette for anyone, especially if you are a beginner and you do not want to spend your money on something that can go towards more products to build your collection. It&#x27;s a good size and i can see myself using every single one of these eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the color combo. Thin design travels well, endless options from matte to shimmer and a few with glitter. I have both Coastal Scents palettes. A more affordable option than the Urban Decay naked palettes.</li>
    <li> Dont even think twice about this product just buy it. Great palette....night time look, day time look, everyday look, you can create many different looks from this once palette. It has both shimmers and matte shadows and heavily pigmented.  I have dark eyelids and i dont use concealer, these shadows still show their true color. Awesome buy!</li>
    <li> The palette is typical quality for coastal scents, and by &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; I mean great! It&#x27;s so much bang for your buck! I have the original revealed palette and I have been using it for months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this one because it has a wider array of matte colors than the original palette. I also like that it has more reds and pinks. I took swatches of all the colors and some of the lighter ones have a little bit of a low payoff, but most of the colors are heavily pigmented and apply very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will always buy from coastal scents!</li>
    <li> Pretty shadows plus they give you a lot of them, nice quality for the price if you&#x27;re hesitating on purchasing the Naked 3, this is an affordable alternative :)</li>
    <li> Im loving this palette!  The colors are great and rich.  I may be buying another one soon!</li>
    <li> I think this is better than the Naked 3. And before you call me some sort of crazy 14 year old that doesn&#x27;t understand quality in make up, hear me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use nearly all mid end and high end makeup. Therefore, I can&#x27;t make any comments about things found at the drugstore, but I hate the Urban Decay Naked palettes. I think some of their other palettes and singles are fine, but the Naked line is terrible. The matte shades don&#x27;t have very much pigmentation and are chalky, while the shimmers and glitters tend to end up on my cheeks rather than my eyes. I think that for the price, there are so many better neutral palette alternatives, like the Lorac Pro or Too Faced Neutral Eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT. I really liked the shades in the Naked 3. So I decided to try it out and see if my original thoughts about the Naked line were still true. And unfortunately they were. The Naked 3 shadows were very poor quality. None of the shades were very wow inducing, and they all had a ridiculous amount of fallout with little pigmentation. And the best part was when I returned it to Sephora and the sales lady told me that these types of shades just don&#x27;t look good on pale skin. Yeah okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I still had a desire for pink eye lids. And a couple weeks ago, I received a little Revealed sampler in my Birchbox. I was really pleased with the quality of the shadows, and I thought, why don&#x27;t I just get the Revealed 2 then. And I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette is fantastic. And that&#x27;s comparing it to mid end eyeshadows. The shades are all very pigmented, they show up on my skin, and the lasting power with a primer is solid. I personally used the Nars smudge proof primer, but I&#x27;m sure others would do. I also like that there is so much variation in the palette. I have used it for simple daytime looks and dramatic going out ones. I have also not had any problems with blending the shadow with my Sigma and Mac brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will address the fall out issue. I find that for simple looks, if you are just patting on one or two colors on the lid, fall out is very minimal. But for more complex looks with lots of blending, yes there is some fall out. I would recommend doing your eyes first and then your foundation in those situations. But it&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the only real complain I have about this palette is that the packaging is janky. It&#x27;s kind of similar to the cardboard packaging of the Lorac Pro. but not as nice, and without a mirror. Mine is also crooked and doesn&#x27;t close quite right. Which is a shame, but I still love the palette.at for simple looks, if you are just patting on one or two colors on the lid, fall out is very minimal.

    <li> I love this palette. The colors are pretty, pigmented and last all day. Great dupe to the UD Naked palettes at a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> Good eyeshadow, however the packaging is so cheap it&#x27;s hard to pretend you&#x27;re using an upscale product, which is what this product is trying to do. The eyeshadow is good pigment though and I use it often.</li>
    <li> No fall out vibrate colours a mixture of both matte and and shiny colours highly pigment lots of transition colours and day look colours</li>
    <li> Great!!&lt;br /&gt;Rapping good&lt;br /&gt;Shipping good&lt;br /&gt;Product good</li>
    <li> One of the best palette out there and very affordable price.I just love it</li>
    <li> Colors are nice and lasts long.</li>
    <li> Live the rich colors, worth the money!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors! Compare to Urban Decay Naked Palette! Great dupe!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for my prom makeup but I still use it on a daily basis! All the colors are pigmented and show up amazingly. I&#x27;m mixed black and white and so have medium-dark tan skin and even the bronze and brown colors show up really well. I use it every day, my mom uses it and after almost 2 1/2 months the palette is still full and intact.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that I can say anything that hasn&#x27;t already been said about this palette. I have really been getting a lot of use out of mine. Some of the colors are not as pigmented as the others, but I find that they are still workable without much fuss. The color selection really is beautiful and I think that most anyone who likes pinks and berry tones would enjoy this palette.</li>
    <li> I love the color variety. Having fun playing with the color combinations.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised of the quality of this palette...then again I wasn&#x27;t all that surprised because coastal scents has never disappointed me, with any of their products. The shades of this palette look great on my brown skin, shimmers do that for me anyway. The feel of the shadow is very soft and with an eyeshadow base, they last all day. At a fraction of the price of higher end palettes, and great quality, this is a must have. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this purchase. Originally I was looking into the Urban Decay palette, when I came across this one. Id say it&#x27;s not as thick as the urban decay, but still very similar and a much better price for the comparison.</li>
    <li> Like others have said, if you are like many of us who love the idea of a Naked 3 palette but just don&#x27;t really like the price and can compromise with quality from time to time (although this palette&#x27;s quality will not disappoint) then this item is defenetly is for you! Also, it&#x27;s so compact and light weight that I&#x27;m able to keep it in my purse for on te go. I have a pretty hefty makeup collection that expends from MAC, Lancome and so forth but I also like to experiment and try every makeup out there. The key is versitility and the palette has it because I can create a whole look without having to reach for another shadow for highlight or for a transition shade. I just love this palette and I&#x27;m 100% happy I got it. I&#x27;m actually getting one for my mom and my cousin.</li>
    <li> Works well harmonised all the colors yet but is good</li>
    <li> I love the first revealed palette and I was so excited to find the new one. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! I love that there are more matte shades (7 total). I use these with primer mostly and the colors are great. I don&#x27;t like the sparkle shades, but luckily there&#x27;s only a few. The rest of the palette is wonderful and worth the low price.</li>
    <li> Love this! The colors could be a bit more pigmented, but it is soo worth the $20! One of my favorite palettes!</li>
    <li> This pallet is perfect for the berry lovers out there. It is amazing! great pigment so smooth and creamy as long as your primer is properly set there is no issue with skipping or blending or anything. You can come out with a more natural look a full blown out smokey berry look. Probably my favorite pallet I own.</li>
    <li> Love! I use the naked palette and it does not offer any pink, so this palette is perfect! Well pigmented and good quality... still cannot believe the price!</li>
    <li> Great palette of colors that blend incredibly well. I get compliments all of the time!</li>
    <li> Good product, like the colors.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in place of naked 3. I really like it and have used it more than any other pallet I have.</li>
    <li> I do enjoy this pallet of colors . The shadows glide on... They also blend very well. I would  defenetly  recommend this product .</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow palette is AMAZING!!! This will stay a favorite for me. I don&#x27;t even see the point of buying the Urban Decay Naked palettes now. :)</li>
    <li> I really liked this palette at this price point. The pigmentation is great, there is some fallout, but not too bad, very pretty soft plum, nudes, browns. A nice mix of shimmer and mattes. With eye primer my shadow lasted all day. I use this for day to day wear and save my more pricey palettes for night/special occasions. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Great palette of various shades of brown.  I would have liked it even more if it had shades of olive, and khaki green included.  A few of the browns have an orange tint when put on the skin, which I don&#x27;t particularly like.&lt;br /&gt;The shadows apply very easily, and have a nice texture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how beautiful the colors are on my eyes. If you add this to your collection you won&#x27;t regret it just remember to prime those eyelids with a quality primer.</li>
    <li> I watched some reviews about this palette on Youtube and I want to try because I am not a big fan of pinky color eye shadows. I am an hooded eye Asian, I found these colors does not make my eyes look puffy like Naked palette, since over shimmery colors would definitely make my eyes look so unnatural. This one is good for both smoky eye and everyday makeup. Now it is my favorite one I almost use it everyday! Definitely worth to try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this palette. The colors look great, almost no fall out, easy to blend, and last all day. Noticeably better quality than elf and other drugstore brands.</li>
    <li> Too flaky specially the pink I wanted to use more of</li>
    <li> Best colors for fall! So glad I picked this up, such a great value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in Australia and this arrived in only a week, so really impressed. This is a beautiful palette. Many cheaper eyeshadows I have, the lighter colours are really ineffective (you can&#x27;t even see them), but not these. The light colours are stunning and it&#x27;s a beautiful palette for creating pink, neutral/brown, purply and eye looks. For smokey and dark eyes the first palette is more suitable which I also bought. Really easy to create a professional look. And really glad I didn&#x27;t pay an arm and a leg for the &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; version (which is HUGELY expensive in Australia). Adore!</li>
    <li> I got my package in a few days which I am very happy about. I wanted this after seeing so many positive reviews on it through YouTube. I love the colors and cant wait to use it!! Its smaller than I expected but its a great palette to have especially if you are beginner or overall makeup lover.</li>
    <li> Love these pallets.  They are of the same quality as Urban Decay for about a third of the price.  They glide on nicely, and stay put all day.  Very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the darker colors as eye liner yet but I will and then provide an update to this review.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week. they are pretty good. I wouldnt say they are the closest thing to Urban Decay Naked but they are alright. the colors are very soft and buttery which i LOVE. the sparkly colors are not pigmented very well so I think those are probably just to put over a darker color. it did stay on pretty much all day without primer so that is a good sign. i am going to try them with an eyelid primer and see if there is any difference.</li>
    <li> I love this pallet. It has shimmers and mattes. The colors are gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Nice packaging, lovely texture of the shadows. Also very long lasting. But as a side note, I always use a Mac paintpot as a primer.</li>
    <li> I received a sample in my monthly beauty box and decided to give the full pallet a try. I&#x27;m so thankful I did! I&#x27;ve been able to create wide variety of looks with these colors. The eyeshadow itself goes on very smooth and blends easily. I see no difference between this and the more expensive competitors. I can&#x27;t wait to try out some other pallettes from Coastal Scents.</li>
    <li> This pallet is amazing!! Its better than urban decays naked 3 pallet and that&#x27;s saying a lot. The colors are so pigmented with long lasting color.</li>
    <li> Great variety of shimmers, mattes, and neutral colors in the rosey family. Very pigmented. Great value for so many shadows</li>
    <li> The Coastal Scents Revealed line is INCREDIBLE!!  I have purchased Urban Decay Naked 3 two times, and I always end up selling it or returning it. The colors in the Revealed 2 are, in MY opinion so much more pigmented and. Also offers a wider variety of options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a palette, but don&#x27;t have the money to spend on High End palettes, I would definitely pick the Revealed palettes up!  I sincerely love these palettes!!  And I am a HUGE Urban Decay fan, but truly prefer Revealed 2 over Naked 3.  Even if you own Urban Decay, I would urge you to give this a try!  I absolutely LOVE this!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing quality and price. Paired with their pro fluff blending brush (MAC 217 dupe) my eye makeup has never looked better! I recommend 100%!! I now want them all :)</li>
    <li> Love how very well pigmented these are!!!  They blend beautifully, and are just a dream to work with,  I only had two shades that were chalky but that&#x27;s still not bad. I think this would also be good for beginners. I highly recommend this product!!  The only down side I have is the packaging, it&#x27;s just feels like cardboard, I feel like if I was to travel with it it would just shatter, but that&#x27;s nothing big, I depotted mine and put them in a z pallete.</li>
    <li> Nice Eye-shadow palette. Good color range. I would suggest using a primer prior to shadow application. This will aid in the shadow adhering to the skin...</li>
    <li> Works just as well as more expensive brand which is sold in JC Penny&#x27;s.  Colors are nice and I was so impressed with it I ordered the number 3 palette.  And it&#x27;s not just two uses in one color and it&#x27;s done.  It seems to have a decent amount in each color and the price is exceptiona.</li>
    <li> The pigment showed exactly how you see it! Love it!</li>
    <li> Considered returning g a couple of times just because I had similar colors in another palette. Kept it because the colors are so nice.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t disappoint me at all. I have fairly oily eyelids and this shadow lasted well throughout the day with minimum shadow base used with it. Normally by the end of the day my eye shadow is barely visible even when I use a base, but this product lasted fairly well on my eyelids.</li>
    <li> I am very surprised with this palette. It is very pigmented on its own way. It doesn&#x27;t fall off and very smooth. Most of all,for the price of this palette, it stay longer and doesn&#x27;t crease but of course like any other eyeshadows,you need to use an eyeshadow primer.</li>
