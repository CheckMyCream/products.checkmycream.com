<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tweezerman is awesome. And this set is just the best. The scissors will literally last forever.</li>
    <li> Wonderful , will buy again .</li>
    <li> Sharp great scissors obviously tweezerman is a good brand ..... but the thumb and index finger holes are a little small and I even have normal (slightly small) fingers!</li>
    <li> Scissors are not made for adult hands...very small and hard to handle</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few months now and I think it does a good job.  I tried another kind from Sephora but it did not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time. It is easy to use and does an excellent job. I was extremely please with this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I tried it.  Feels a little clumsy.  I think I need practice.</li>
    <li> I received my Tweezers before the shipping date. It came in great condition. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I have seen other people use them and I know they will work great.If they don&#x27;t you guys will be hearing from me again soon. I am sure they will work just fine though.</li>
    <li> This really helps me to make my eyebrows look professionally trimmed.  Easy to use and seem to be constructed well.  I plan to buy some for my daughter too</li>
    <li> As a Mom trying to make money go further I decided to forgo salon brow treatments and attempt the feat myself!  I&#x27;ve been using this set for several weeks and my brows look like I just came from the salon.  Paired with the tweezerman tweezers, I&#x27;ve got all the tools I need.  Yes, they&#x27;re more $ than the drug store stuff - but worth it when you figure you spend 10-20 $ a month for salon services! Easily worth it!</li>
    <li> I have very sparse brows, but the individual hairs are long. So my brows look raggedy and unruly at the same time. This works wonders to get the brow shape I want by trimming them. I&#x27;ve had them a couple of months, using them weekly. Seems sturdy and well made. The scissors are very sharp but the point is dull at the end so you don&#x27;t poke yourself. I am quite pleased.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Works perfect &amp; delivered early.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyebrow shaping scissors, easy to use and accurate. Comes with a nifty litle brush too! I am right-handed so I don&#x27;t know about how it works for lefties.</li>
    <li> Well constructed and works perfectly for trimming my mustache. I&#x27;ve had it now for some time and it continues to cut well and perform as expected. Quality of material is the high point. Good product.</li>
    <li> Fabulously tackles long eye brows. The angled scissor is a genius idea, and does the job very conveniently.   Excellent quality product.</li>
    <li> I love these scissors. They feel comfortable in my hand, face the correct direction, and are ergonomic to use. And they are nice and sharp. Makes trimming brows much easier, quicker, and more accurate. The comb part is just so-so, I prefer a lash comb, but the scissors are perfect- one of those things where I wondered where has this been all my life.</li>
    <li> Really like the brush and the curved scissors...makes trimming rather easy. Brush appears strong and scissors well made. This is the 2nd Tweezerman set I purchased and very happy with the brand</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Made to last.</li>
    <li> in love with those scissors!! The quality is really good and the shape of the scissors makes it so easy to trim the hairs just how you want to! And the delivery was so fast and on time! Satisfied costumer!!!!</li>
    <li> These are just what I needed...the little comb helps straighten brows or arrange them for cutting. The scissors work nicely to trim long brows and make them fall more neatly. They&#x27;re pretty sharp (in a good way) and are nice and precise. Great little kit!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect brow shaping set.  The scissors are nice and sharp and angled perfectly for brow trimming.  The brush makes sure you only cut the hairs you mean to.  I love this set.  I couldn&#x27;t go with out it now.</li>
    <li> I used to pluck eyebrow hairs that looked long or a bit unruly, but over the years I realized that my brows were getting thinner and thinner. I may never get them back to how they used to look, but now I never pluck unless it is a very errant hair. The little scissors are easy to use and angled just right to cut precisely after brushing the hairs straight up. Really like it!</li>
    <li> I received the set a while ago and use them every a few weeks.  The scissors works well and in very good quality, but I am not sure about the brush - the brush head is very loosely attached to the handle, it swivels when I use it.  Not sure if that&#x27;s the way it suppose to be...</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the Tweezerman name and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  The brow shaping brush helps comb unruly brows into place for trimming.  The scissors are small, well, really they&#x27;re just the right size for trimming eyebrows.  The scissors are comfortable, sharp, and great quality.  My brows are happy now!</li>
    <li> I went to utube to learn how to groom eyebrows and this product was recommended. They are very sharp and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This was a super great economical purchase!  The price in most retail stores is double the price if not more.  My eyebrows look phenomenal!</li>
    <li> Shaping a nice eyebrow takes practices. But Tweezerman Brow Shaping Scissors and Brush makes it much easier to be done. Buying a good one worth for buying a 10 cheap one.</li>
    <li> These scissors are not for adults. Perhaps some female adults can use them even though the finger holes are so small. I purchased them to trim my mustache-only ones by Tweezerman that are small and pointed so it does not move the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I have small hands for a man and I had to jam them onto my thumb and finger just to try them out-very uncomfortable. The scissors cut precisely and otherwise perform just as described. I ended up giving them away since the return shipping cost was nearly the same cost as the scissors. A Tweezer\\&quot;man\\&quot; surely did not design these scissors--unless made for midgets or Chinese.</li>
    <li> This tool works very well</li>
    <li> Great little scissors.  Love the curve and they are very sharp</li>
    <li> I got tired of raking a razor across my unibrow and just hoping for the best. This product keeps my brows looking like they were trimmed by my barber. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This Is a Great quality product and the pricing was much lower than less quality items I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> This is a great price just order some. We have more on the way as my staff like these better then the $30 ones we ordered.</li>
    <li> I got these to remove matts from my cat along with several different items.  These turned out to be the best and are super easy to use to get into tight spaces.  Very sharp and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are fabulous and really make it easy to &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; my brows in between the brow appointments with my aesthetian (who is amazing).  A quick trim and I can get by another week or two in emergencies!  Tweezerman products always last long and are made of great quality.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The scissors fits perfectly in my hand for better control when cutting my eyebrow hairs.  It&#x27;s sharp and works well</li>
    <li> These are the best eyebrow scissors I have ever purchased. At first, I was unsure because of the slant, but it really helps to not trim too much.  If you&#x27;ve ever trimmed your eyebrows too short, you know what I&#x27;m saying.....</li>
    <li> Awesome quality. Tweezerman always comes through with the best products! I&#x27;m sold on Tweezerman :) I highlly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman.. the best money can buy! Strong set of scissors!</li>
    <li> these provide a low risk way to shape up the brows.  Would be tough (not impossible) to make an unfortunate snip of the eyebrows w/ this set up.  You push w/ the fuzzy tipped tool, and come in w/ the angled clippers.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Great scissors for brow shaping. Sharp and precise. High quality product that I would recommend to everyone. Tweezerman has never disappointed me.</li>
    <li> Good quality, as expected!</li>
    <li> The scissors have stayed sharp and they are also shaped nicely for easy use for trimming brows. I love them!</li>
    <li> i love it, amazing amazing.</li>
    <li> It came fast and I can trim my eyebrows better with this tool.</li>
    <li> Nice sharp scissors and the design works nicely.  The brush also helpful.  Together they do a great job.</li>
    <li> These scissors are amazinggg. They are nice and sturdy and don&#x27;t feel like a cheap pair of scissors. They&#x27;re pretty sharp and cut my eyebrows perfectly. I really love that they came with a brush so I didn&#x27;t have to buy that separately. I enjoy having a more natural look to my eyebrows instead of going to the salon and having them waxed. I just like to get them \\&quot;cleaned up\\&quot; and not shaped. I&#x27;m so happy I won&#x27;t have to pay someone else to do my eyebrows!</li>
    <li> brush your brow hair with a spooly then hold it in place with a spooly. this way you will see which hair need to be cut and you have more control. cant really cut hair straight without holding it in place. I don&#x27;t have a problem with scissors being \\&quot;one sided\\&quot;, works for me, I can use them on both brows with no problem. i brush hair up on the inner half of the brow and hold the spooly (more toward the top of the brow)in the same direction while cutting them. on the outer part of the brow I brush the hair down and hold the spooly (more toward the bottow of the brow)in place while cutting in the downward direction. the straighter part of the scissors should lay flat against your skin and the curved one with the indentation should be facing out</li>
    <li> Very nice high quality scissors!  They are made in Italy, which they should advertise more prominently, since many things on Amazon are made in China and cheap according to several reviews I&#x27;ve read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp, tiny point at the tip, perfect for trimming eyelashes and eyebrows.  They should last me a very long time!  I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> Was skeptical about order eye brow scissors online, but these were great.  Sharp and ready to trim the hairs :0)</li>
    <li> great product easy to use and very high qulaity</li>
    <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
    <li> Oddness meets functionality. These scissors get right in there, snipping away those tiny thin hairs with its sly, side shape. The brow brush is a nice addition as well. It&#x27;s all pretty basic, and I use both frequently.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman lives up to all the hype. Much better quality than those big drugstore brands. I can see these lasting a long time. Also, it&#x27;s hard to make a mistake when trimming your brows with these cause they are very easy to handle. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> Quality stainless steel product.  Cuts well and the brush is helpful to make sure to trim all brow hairs neatly.</li>
    <li> Best scissors and brush for eyebrows!  Although a bit more expensive than other brands, they are easy to use.  I would often go to my eyebrows designer, but now I can work on them at home.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product!  I happen to obsess over grooming my own eyebrows and these intruments (scissors and brush) work absolutely magnificently!  I highly recommend them!  I have no complaints!  It&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
    <li> The angled scissor makes trimming a breeze.  Straight scissors usually make trimming one brow awkward because you have to twist your wrist strangely.  Not so with these.  Great product.</li>
    <li> These are very sharp and perfect for the task. Love.</li>
    <li> I love Tweezerman and this is no exception.  A great price on an amazing product.  Thanks for such high quality.</li>
    <li> The scissors are slanted, unlike other brow scissors, and it makes all the difference.  First try out, I did a decent job.  These are really good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice product we used and purchased from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for eyebrows and eye shapes. Like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-HP</li>
    <li> Will Never buy another pair of brow scissors from any other maker again. These scissors are excellent for brows, and any other trimming that needs to get done.</li>
    <li> I bought these base on the reviews for eyebrows....But I bought them for trimming my mustache.  I have a long beard, but keep by stach trimmed above my upper lip to keep it out of my mouth.  These do have rather small finger holes, but you only need your finger tips through and you can really pin-point hairs and keep a well groomed mustache.  I even trimmed my eye brows.... the recommended use for them and again, incredible.  Super sharp and well worth the money!  highly recommend for a well groomed hairy man :)  I don&#x27;t know about the little brush that comes with it....give it to your wife.</li>
    <li> These scissors are very sharp, which allows for precision trimming of the eyebrows.  They are the perfect compliment to my tweezers!</li>
    <li> The curved design is brilliant (it just sits against your brow), and they are just the right size. Pair with Tweezerman Slants and you&#x27;re set.</li>
    <li> Angled scissors are easy and comfortable to use. I wish the brush had a tiny comb on the other end.</li>
    <li> Wish these scissors cut closer to the root.</li>
    <li> Great duo!  Neat little brush to pull hairs up, and the scissors work real well.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I wish they would give a better quality brush. Other than that, I have no reason to complain. The scissors work perfectly.</li>
    <li> quite sharp and easy to handle. good quality</li>
    <li> They really are napkins and perform as a you would thing they should. No surprise. Color was as described. Pretty foolish to ask for a review of this type of item:)</li>
    <li> this is nice little set to help trim hairs when they get too long. scissors are easy to grip and hairs are easy to cut.</li>
    <li> The Tweezerman Stainless Brow Shapng Scissors are easy to use for trimming and shaping eyebrows. The brush that comes with it is not of good quality, however.</li>
    <li> All of the reviews are right on. These are great brow scissors. Better than any I&#x27;ve had. they are extremely sturdy and the curvature does allow great control over getting the perfect angle. I had no expectations for the brush, I anticipated it would be a throw away. But it&#x27;s actually pretty ok. I&#x27;ll probably toss it in my travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would repurchase but don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll have to for a long while.</li>
    <li> Love these products, very easy to use.  The quality is very good and they last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Works well, except the finger holes are on the small side.</li>
    <li> I bought this set based on the reviews and they were spot-on. Great little brush, gets everything going in the right direction. The scissor is great because of its curve and the fact that you can get real close.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, works just like I expected it to.  All Tweezerman product seems to be a great brand all around.</li>
    <li> Great item. Super fast delivery. Smaller than expected but works great, sharpe and little brush is nice not cheap plastic handle.</li>
    <li> Great for left eyebrow.... AwkwRd for right.</li>
    <li> I really found these scissors and brush helpful when trimming eyebrows.  The scissors are very sharp and make a nice clean cut.  I especially like the little &amp;#34;divit&amp;#34; in the scissors where you rest your finger so you can do a steadier job.  The brush is nice and small and you can see what you&#x27;re doing when you use it.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
