      <li>I was quite impressed especially since it was in the midst of the storm, Sandy.</li>

      <li>The red thyme has a wonderful, aromatic scent that makes my home, after dusting, smell very clean.</li>
      <li>Besides the huge amounts of data available on the Internet, excellent books to refer to are ones on aromatherapy, safety when using essential oils and those about using herbal extracts.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product for hair growth.</li>

      <li>, it&#x27;s best when blended in small amounts of with almond oil, olive oil or jojoba oil</li>
      <li>I am SURE this is pure and quality product, but ewww I could not get the smell out of my nose.</li>
      <li>Good quality Essential Oil.</li>
      <li>I purchase this oil to use on mild plantar warts.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Kind of a smokier version of the white thyme oil I have</li>
      <li>It is a powerful substance and I suggest doing your research before using.</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t fun...)</li>
      <li>I have only had for a week or so, but have enjoyed it and found it very useful</li>
      <li>Pretty repulsive.</li>
      <li>it definitely works better than what the medicine the doctor prescribed.  </li>
      <li>at first i used too much and it burned and itched a bit,</li>
      <li>This is not something to take lightly just because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;; you can do real harm if you are not careful.</li>
      <li>I observed no dramatic change in the skin itself over a week.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to buying my oils from a certain UK company..</li>
      <li>Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much &amp; it kills fast.  </li>
      <li>I also really like their all-purpose cleaning spray</li>
      <li>Really.</li>
      <li>but by being more careful i have had no problem with it.  </li>
      <li>, it has really added to the effects of my homemade moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>must be lower quality, less potent.</li>
      <li>I was able to wipe it out in less that 5 applications.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes.used x2 per day.had to use gloves .i don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite scent, it is OK when blended with other oils, Thyme has a VERY strong scent, and gave me headache, even when highly diluted it still were unpleasant to me.</li>
      <li>I also started developing a little spot on my leg which seemed to be a recurring fungal infection which I was able to wipe out with prescription cream, however, I decided to use thyme oil on skin as well, since I bought the bottle anyway.</li>
      <li>Good stuff, but a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This seems like a high quality red thyme oil - Thymus vulgaris; it certainly smells like concentrated thyme oil - whew!  </li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t dissipate quickly, so if you can&#x27;t tolerate the odor, it lingers for a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I realize now this will last two lifetimes, and the smaller size would have been fine.</li>
      <li>The new bottle has been problem free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried many other essential oils</li>
      <li>They fixed it immediately by sending a new bottle.  </li>
      <li>on hard surfaces; there have been many legitimate studies proving this.  </li>
      <li>In order to simplify my cleaning routine/products, I just add Thymol directly to the 28 oz.  </li>
      <li>I got a follow up email from the owner a week after I had received the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I had developed a problem with the dropper.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer a size the will last.  </li>
      <li>I was using it for its natural anti-biotic effects.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my homemade cleaners because Thyme is a natural disinfectant.</li>
      <li>It is very strong and it is not pleasant to use in a diffuser.</li>
      <li>it really burnt a lot, but the ringworm dried up very fast, so maybe it worked on that too.</li>
      <li>When I use this with a protective style I am able to get speedy results  as my hair normally grows very Slow</li>
      <li>first shipment arrived in a padded envelope, with the bottle crushed.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was as off-putting as many noted, but it&#x27;s definitely not a pleasant odor.</li>
      <li>It really has the odor of a wet leaf pile that is burning.  </li>
      <li>I use this essential oil,(with all proper cautions, dilute first), in several home preparations for wound healing and relief for arthritic joints, all external applications.</li>
      <li>I would only order this again if one need it for a very specific recipe or as part of another blend, but at least for me 30ml turned out to be much more than I</li>
      <li>I bought this because I had red that you can add Thyme e/o to baking soda and coconut oil for a natural toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Be  careful when using these high strength oils.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent Amazon seller/. Great product.</li>
    <li> This product was excellent - very high quality.  I was using it for its natural anti-biotic effects.  It worked great.&lt;br /&gt;This companies customer service was great. I got a follow up email from the owner a week after I had received the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I had developed a problem with the dropper.  I responded to the owner and described the problem. They fixed it immediately by sending a new bottle.  The new bottle has been problem free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchase this oil to use on mild plantar warts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shipment arrived in a padded envelope, with the bottle crushed.  Instead of just shipping another, Amazon forced me to return the dregs for a refund, and re-order another shipment. Ah, well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself smells a bit of a cross between diesel exhaust and burned sage. I didn&#x27;t think it was as off-putting as many noted, but it&#x27;s definitely not a pleasant odor.It also doesn&#x27;t dissipate quickly, so if you can&#x27;t tolerate the odor, it lingers for a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it didn&#x27;t burn when applied to the plantar area. Many people commented that it stung badly. I noticed no sensation at all, even on raw, new skin. I observed no dramatic change in the skin itself over a week. Nonetheless, the wart vanished in that timeframe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied it to a new cut and to cystic acne, it stung like crazy. The time that the cut remained open seemed a bit shorter than cuts I&#x27;ve treated with nothing, and the cystic acne was noticeably smaller the next day. No irritation of surrounding skin results, for both applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. I ordered this larger size not knowing what to expect. I realize now this will last two lifetimes, and the smaller size would have been fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased it to fight fungal infection on toes. I also started developing a little spot on my leg which seemed to be a recurring fungal infection which I was able to wipe out with prescription cream, however, I decided to use thyme oil on skin as well, since I bought the bottle anyway. I was able to wipe it out in less that 5 applications. But the nail fungus is still unaffected. The only thing I hate about it is the SMELL....It is disgusting. Smells like gasoline..Really. And nothing like thyme (or at least my idea of what thyme should smell like). I used it undiluted, maybe that&#x27;s why....If it does what it is supposed to do I will update this review.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, good device... Will reorder</li>
    <li> For my good health considering how the environment is being tampered with by others.&lt;br /&gt;Also the health system (not) offers poor solutions to natural benefits.</li>
    <li> smells great and very useful</li>
    <li> Not my favorite scent, it is OK when blended with other oils, Thyme has a VERY strong scent, and gave me headache, even when highly diluted it still were unpleasant to me. I would only order this again if one need it for a very specific recipe or as part of another blend, but at least for me 30ml turned out to be much more than I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did find that one could use it as a good in effect but nasty smelling salt.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product for hair growth. When I use this with a protective style I am able to get speedy results  as my hair normally grows very Slow</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work,burned fingers instead.I had high hopes.used x2 per day.had to use gloves .i don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
    <li> I have used Thyme essential oils in past, but never Plant Therapy Brand.  The product seems to work like others, but the smell is horrible.  It really has the odor of a wet leaf pile that is burning.  Pretty repulsive.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my scalp for hair growth and was quite shocked at how much my hair grew. My hair would grow to my shoulders and then plateau. I decided to try the thyme while my hair was braided and my hair grew to the bottom  of my bra strap.  I have never had these type of results with any products</li>
    <li> just what I needed. a good price for it too. I bought this for my homemade cleaners because Thyme is a natural disinfectant. It came packaged great so that it did not break.</li>
    <li> This thyme smells different than what I have gotten before. I guess there are two different qualities of refinement with this essential oil and red must be lower quality, less potent.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in household cleaning spray.  I have noticed that there are several companies selling antibacterial cleaning spray with .05% Thymol as an ingredient.  Thymol has been shown to kill e-coli, salmonella, etc. on hard surfaces; there have been many legitimate studies proving this.  It doesn&#x27;t take much &amp; it kills fast.  My favorite kitchen &amp; bath antibac spray is made by Method.  I also really like their all-purpose cleaning spray but that product does not have Thymol as an ingredient.  In order to simplify my cleaning routine/products, I just add Thymol directly to the 28 oz.  bottle of Method All-Purpose cleaner.  I get the cleaning/shining power of the all-purpose cleaner &amp; the antibac properties of the antibac cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems like a high quality red thyme oil - Thymus vulgaris; it certainly smells like concentrated thyme oil - whew!  Be  careful when using these high strength oils.  If you use on your skin, you MUST dilute it with a carrier oil or some other benign liquid.  You can burn your skin &amp; cause a very nasty allergic reaction.  Search online for reputable websites giving advice for dilution.  This is not something to take lightly just because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;; you can do real harm if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> consider before you get this - it smells so bad I had headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you can use something else, you might want to</li>
    <li> the recipe I&#x27;m using it in also contains rosemary, lavender &amp; cedarwood. I have to use it for 45 days to see some results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m counting on it to do the job.</li>
    <li> I heard that thyme oil treats fungus nail so I am waiting to see the result.</li>
    <li> It is superb for my apnea. I would never be without it. It stinks but I&#x27;d rather smell stinky thyme than wear a CPAP.</li>
    <li> I use this oil in some of my nontoxic cleaners. The red thyme has a wonderful, aromatic scent that makes my home, after dusting, smell very clean. I have tried many other essential oils but I will continue to use Plant Therapy products for years to come. Plus, their prices are hard to beat. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Item was packaged well and arrived before estimated arrival time. I was quite impressed especially since it was in the midst of the storm, Sandy. Because of the excellent, quality product and great service rendered from this vendor, I highly recommend them and their products.</li>
    <li> I use this essential oil,(with all proper cautions, dilute first), in several home preparations for wound healing and relief for arthritic joints, all external applications. I also use it for aroma therapy. It is a powerful substance and I suggest doing your research before using. Besides the huge amounts of data available on the Internet, excellent books to refer to are ones on aromatherapy, safety when using essential oils and those about using herbal extracts. It is a good product and I get results.</li>
    <li> Great scent and good for general use.  I use a lot of oil sfor different things and these are great.</li>
    <li> This review is on the product, not the seller. I bought this because I had red that you can add Thyme e/o to baking soda and coconut oil for a natural toothpaste. This is a personal 3 because I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell and taste. I tried to use less, but it just makes me gag. Others may like it, however, and see the benefits outweigh the cosmetics of it. Seller was prompt and packaging was great!</li>
    <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a different type of thyme from what I&#x27;m used to but.. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad per se.. It just doesn&#x27;t smell great. I think the white thyme is the one I should have gotten</li>
    <li> Good stuff, but a little goes a long way. Kind of a smokier version of the white thyme oil I have (I think I prefer the white, because it&#x27;s milder, but this is of good quality and has an authentic scent).</li>
    <li> i bought this to use on toenail fungus.  it seems to work quite well on this problem(it will take a while to see if it totally works).  it definitely works better than what the medicine the doctor prescribed.  at first i used too much and it burned and itched a bit, but by being more careful i have had no problem with it.  i did apply some to what appeared to be a ringworm.  it really burnt a lot, but the ringworm dried up very fast, so maybe it worked on that too.</li>
    <li> This one ounce size should last sometime.  I much prefer a size the will last.  Have discovered several uses for Thyme oil.</li>
    <li> IF you know what thyme smells like and you want thyme, go ahead, I am sure this is quality product. However, if you, like me, were unaware of its smell, do not purchase this.  It is very strong and it is not pleasant to use in a diffuser. I am SURE this is pure and quality product, but ewww I could not get the smell out of my nose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to buying my oils from a certain UK company.. but I tried these by chance because I needed them urgently, and they are amazing.. I would recommend them to anyone!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so horrible I cant even use it</li>
    <li> Great Product, I like it alot.  I have trouble with adult onset acne, but hate using harsh chemicals on my skin that only irritate it further.  I previously made an infused oil with other ingrediants,  then I found out the Thyme is great for acne, so I purchased this and added into my oil for my face and am very pleased with the results, it has really added to the effects of my homemade moisturizer.  I have also used it to help with some cuts and skin irritations for my huband and it has worked well for him as well.  I have only had for a week or so, but have enjoyed it and found it very useful so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  like any essential oil, DO NOT put this on your skin undiluted, it is not a pleasant experience (yeah... I actually tried that and it wasn&#x27;t fun...), it&#x27;s best when blended in small amounts of with almond oil, olive oil or jojoba oil (I am sure there are more oils it&#x27;s good with, those are just my three \\&quot;staples\\&quot; I keep on hand.  This stuff is powerfull, a little goes a long way!!</li>
