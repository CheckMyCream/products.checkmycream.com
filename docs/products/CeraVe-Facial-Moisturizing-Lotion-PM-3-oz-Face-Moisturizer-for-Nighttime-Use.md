      <li>I am putting this to the test this winter for sure.</li>

      <li>Nothing was helping me, then my sister recommended CeraVe, and my skin has improved tremendously!</li>
      <li>but I already notice a huge difference in the softness of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>She loves getting it put on and its making her skin so smooth compared to how scaley it was before.</li>
      <li>This is a great, low price option for nighttime use.</li>

      <li>But like I said for someone with normal skin this would be amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s expired since I&#x27;ve used the product before.</li>
      <li>It is creamy and rich.  </li>
      <li>Great product for dry skin</li>
      <li>The cream is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Great for dry skin!</li>

      <li>excellent moisturizer - thick and creamy - works wonders on winter skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and I had an allergic reaction to this product.  It is creamy and rich.  I definitely cannot use it on my face; I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the parabens.  I will try using it on my feet.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very dry &amp; very sensitive skin. For awhile I was using Aveeno Clear Complexion, and while that settled into my skin/didn&#x27;t irritate it, I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting moisturized from it. I decided to try this stuff after hearing good things and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It absorbs into my skin and my skin feels amazing. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days but I already notice a huge difference in the softness of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use this along with their Foaming Facewash and my skin feels great. I&#x27;m 20 years old and my skin feels as soft as it did when I was 16.</li>
    <li> This cream is not greasy, absorbs quickly, and seems perfect for people like me with very sensitive skin that the usual moisturizers can often irritate.</li>
    <li> My must have for the skin care. I do have an eczema and it&#x27;s the only cream which does not cause any irritation.</li>
    <li> This product made my face breakout! I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s expired since I&#x27;ve used the product before. Pay the extra buck, and buy it from your local drugstore.</li>
    <li> Best ever! my boys don&#x27;t cry when i apply this one to their eczema! that right there is worth it!</li>
    <li> This jar i HUGE! It is OK, just not GREAT!  I doubt that I would buy it again as I can&#x27;t tell it really does anything for my face other than what any other &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; moisturizer would do.  It DOES break my sensitive skin out a bit as well.  STILL trying to beat Burts Bees face cream that does NOT break me out at all!!!</li>
    <li> Dry skin is going with this cream!</li>
    <li> This stuff will work magic on your dry cracked hands. It builds up your skin barrier so you don&#x27;t have to lotion a ton which I hate. Also soaks in quickly</li>
    <li> excellent therepeutical</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using CeraVe on my daughter for a few years; it works wonders for her eczema.</li>
    <li> I read very positive review about the cream, recommended by dermatologists. I have dry skin and feel it moisturize it very nicely, and it does not feel greasy at all. I guess one may get generally healthy skin after using it for long, but if you are looking for particular effect (whitening, smoothing wrinkles, etc), it might not work that way.</li>
    <li> I recently went through a psoriasis flare up, and found this on Amazon.  I really loved it.  It was odorless and did not burn or hurt when I put it on.  It worked well to hydrate my skin, although I did have to reapply (my skin is very, very dry.)  It didn&#x27;t stain my clothes or leave any marks. Definitely will be in my lotion rotation now.</li>
    <li> So far so good, it absorbs nicely.  What really attracted me to this product is the container.  I am tired of containers that leave half the product inaccessible towards the end.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> LOVE this cream.Well worth the extra cost</li>
    <li> Best moisture I&#x27;ve evr used</li>
    <li> I have eczema which got very bad 2 months postpartum. I got this weird eczema patch on my middle finger that wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what. This product is great and was the only thing that worked. It&#x27;s not shiny and greasy like a competitor that starts with &amp;#34;e&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m a nurse and I wash my hands a lot and use etoh based sanitizer. This keeps my hands soft. Wish it didn&#x27;t have paraben or if give 5 stars</li>
    <li> I have been using the CeraVe lotion and decided to try the cream.  Really like the cream.  Good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> Amazing cream. I have tried so many and this is a keeper! My stylist recommended it. He said his dermatologist recommended it! I think it has been a well kept secret. It is so inexpensive and comes in a huge size- incredible value!</li>
    <li> Nice and thick. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  My dermatologist recommends it too!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was recommended by our dermatologist for our son&#x27;s eczema.  So glad I did!  His skin looks great &amp; he doesn&#x27;t complain about being dry/itchy/tight anymore.  There is no over powering scent and a little bit goes a long way!  I have also been using it to sooth my hands that are chapped from washing them so much.  Makes my skin look healthy &amp; feel soft.</li>
    <li> After just 1 week there was a very noticeable improvement ! Works very well and the container will last me a long time before I have to purchase another.</li>
    <li> Got it to work in tandem with prescribed creams and it does work very well, leaves the skin hydrated and fresh. Definitely better than that normal nivea type crap.</li>
    <li> This stuff if the magic sauce, not even kidding. It may not be ideal for your face if you have oily skin, but otherwise this stuff is straight up Harry Potter level magic. The CeraVe AM facial moisturizer is pretty amazing, too, it has SPF 30 in it but it&#x27;s easy to apply quickly in the morning. Between those two products I have the most sought after skin in my city, I&#x27;m constantly on the lookout for Buffalo Bill because of it.</li>
    <li> I use this every day. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist for my dry skin. Works well. Arrived quickly and was $4 cheaper than at the  local &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; store; eliminating a trip I try to avoid.</li>
    <li> This stuff really makes skin soft, smooth, and moisturized. My mom had chemo and they recommended she purchase this and she loves it! She got a better deal than buying it in store and it was worth the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; money that it cost versus a traditional moinsturizer.</li>
    <li> My sister had lizard feet w&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister had lizard feet, so I bought her this cream.  Her feet are now smooth as silk.  She even proudly showed them off to us.</li>
    <li> Packaging arrived on time, and product was well packed. This product works good, but it is more on the thick side. After putting on it feels like I have another layer on. The product did not break out my skin, I have sensitive and oily skin. Overall I liked the product just not the texture of it.</li>
    <li> Great help and thanks for your service!!!  GOD BLESS YOU !!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Always an excellent product</li>
    <li> Beyond love this cream! I had really bad dry skin... itchy - itchy all the time. Now- I have soft and moist skin! I am putting this to the test this winter for sure. I&#x27;ll review again after winter!</li>
    <li> I have dermatitis/psoriasis on my face so I CANNOT get my skin to not be dry but I also break out all the time (hormonal acne) so I can&#x27;t use anything that&#x27;s not oil free. This stuff helps so much. Do not use the lotion on your face if you&#x27;re acne prone (like me) use the cream. It&#x27;s gentle but super duper moisturizing. My derm told me to get this (used along with a prescription cream) and my skin is SOOO much better. Dry/Psoriasis/dermatitis/acne prone skin, look no further. I know it doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;face cream&amp;#34; but this is better than anything from Clinique or other Sephora/expensive brand name &amp;#34;super hydrating&amp;#34; creams I&#x27;ve ever used (ever), those things work for like a couple hours, this works ALL day. Dermatologist (highly) recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! I live in Florida but still have fairly dry, sensitive skin for most of the year. This is a great, low price option for nighttime use. I find it too heavy for daytime use most of the year because of the heat and humidity, but it would probably be fine in most climates. Also love this for my hands and feet before bed.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin. It soften my skin and I noticed a BIG difference. Its affordable.</li>
    <li> I ordered this expecting to use it as a night cream for my face. And it&#x27;s an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-VERY thick. A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;-Spreads easily&lt;br /&gt;-Really hydrating&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t smell bad&lt;br /&gt;-One jar will last you FOREVER!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;I found that using this product on my face broke me out. The reason being (unlike with other CeraVe products) it doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s non-comedogenic. Meaning it will clog your pores. HOWEVER, this isn&#x27;t necessarily supposed to be used as a face cream so I can&#x27;t complain. I still use it on dry parts of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for months now and I haven&#x27;t even finished a fourth of the jar!! Great product.</li>
    <li> Cream is great!  Excellent for winter dry skin and for garden hands, too.  I like the smaller 12 ounce container.  It is easier for me to open and easier to reach to the bottom for the last little bit.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Cerave and really like their products. I really like this cream for drier or aging skin because the price is fair and contains good ingredients that I want. I also highly recommend their cleansers and baby wash! Great stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> Absorbs &amp; moisturizes well</li>
    <li> This cream is very nice, but it sits on top of the skin and doesn&#x27;t really soak in.  I can feel it wash off.  It feels a bit waxy, but makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
    <li> My daughter has extremely dry legs.  This cream is the only one that helps her.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream without any perfume--unscented.  I had been using the lotion--not the cream and had red patches on my elbows that hurt.  Finally, I was sent by an internist to a dermatologist at M.D. Anderson in Houston.  The dermatologist said she thought that they were just very dry skin and that this cream was great.  It cleared the places in about 4 days!!!!!  THE LOTION DOES NOT WORK!!!  Not only is the cream fragrance free, but also it is absorbed in a minute or 2!!</li>
    <li> My face has never broken out as much as it did since using this product.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best. I&#x27;ve tried many kinds but have never found another I would want to use on dry legs as well as on the face when irritated from acne. It&#x27;s more of a night cream, but light enough that I can use it in the day too if my skin is bothering me.</li>
    <li> I have really really dry skin during the winter and this hand cream was a Godsend. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist for dry winter skin.  Best moisturizing cream that I have ever used, including Euciderm and Aveeno.  No more itching and unsightly flaking and scaling.  Great product~</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this brand of lotion for my body as I have dry skin amd eczema. In addition, she said it can be uaed on my 2 1/2 year old daughter. Once last thing, she said to buy lotion in a container and not a tube.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a skincare game changer! My skin has been horribly dry, this winter season. Nothing was helping me, then my sister recommended CeraVe, and my skin has improved tremendously!</li>
    <li> Love CeraVe.  I have exceptionally dry skin and this works well.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, but it is way too heavy. Unless you have very dry skin, don&#x27;t use this cream. Use the lotion instead. This cream is so heavy that when I put some on my cheeks, and accidentally some gets on my lips -- my lips feel as if being smeared with a layer of grease. The Cerave lotion is great; I use it all the time for my face and body. But this cream is just way too heavy.</li>
    <li> good value especially as an add on item</li>
    <li> I love this cream! My hands get really dry in the winter, and other lotions I&#x27;ve tried either go on greasy or have to be reapplied constantly (or both). This cream made my hands soft and happy pretty much immediately. It&#x27;s thick and rich but still light at the same time somehow, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly, leaving your hands feeling soft and hydrated with no greasy film or residue, and it lasts. It&#x27;s also unscented, which is a plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only recently discovered CeraVe&#x27; s facial cleansers and moisturizers. I fell in love with those products, and so sought out a CeraVe solution for my dry hands. This cream did not disappoint! It works and feels amazing, and it&#x27;s cheap. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Relief from winter dryness this is the best I have found so far. My derm recommended.</li>
    <li> fantastic for the skin!</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin! I&#x27;ve completely switched over to Cetaphil cleansers and CeraVe moisturizers and I can&#x27;t believe how well my sensitive skin is doing - I should have listened to my dermatologist a year ago, my skin is actually not pink all the time now!</li>
    <li> the best lotion out there!</li>
    <li> Love this and can&#x27;t get enough if it</li>
    <li> Highly recommended for eczema or winter dry itchy skin. Use it after showering so it locks moisture into freshly hydrated skin cells.  This product, like others with ceramides, helps to replenish natural skin lipids that are diminished when the skin is super dry.  Our family prefers Cerave because it has next to zero odor, it soaks in quickly so is not gooey feeling, and it lasts without leaving a skim of grease on clothing and everything we touch.  Everyone gets his or her own large jar (that&#x27;s five jars here) at the first cold snap in the fall.  It is worth the investment, rather than being miserable and buying random lotions, ointments and creams that go unused and cost the same in wasted money.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizing cream recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I work as a nurse and have had eczema since I was a kid. All the alcohol gel ans hand washing was doing a number on my hands...dry, cracked, flaky! This cream has done wonders and does not irritate any cuts I might have developed on my hands from over washing!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy to cream. I use it on my face. I only need a little bit. It sinks right in, not oily or greasy. A perfect cream at the right price.</li>
    <li> I like it. My skin did not breakout from it yet.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good cream lotion. I first bought this to be my main facial lotion as I have dry sensitive skin. However I find that it works best when you don&#x27;t wear it under liquid makeup. I also have to use a lot and I noticed my face was still pealing in places despite dedicated use. This is a very thick cream based lotion but I think it is more ideal for people who have normal skin and have some dry days or even have small areas on the body that need extra moisture. For those people I think it would be great for after you take an evening shower/bath or wash your face and want to put a nice moisturizing cream on before bed. What I have noticed is if I wash my face, then I use this cream on my face.. let it sit and then apply my liquid foundation it tends to want to pull up \\&quot;residue\\&quot; of the lotion. Nothing bad just not ideal under makeup. At first I thought it was dry skin flakes and then I realized the lotion was sortof not mixing well with the foundation because it was not fully absorbed. This happens even with less lotion used. I am currenly using the [[ASIN:B0071XPQQ2 Cerave Sa Renewing Skin Lotion, 8 Ounce]] in the pump for an all over body lotion and love it and have recently started to use it on my face as well and it is working for me without giving my makeup any issues either. I think my dry sensitive skin just needed more then this cream could give. But like I said for someone with normal skin this would be amazing. All of CeraVe products are wonderful. I also use their [[ASIN:B000YJ2SKM CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, 12 Ounce]].</li>
    <li> Good product only took 5 days to arrive with Prime.</li>
    <li> I have over 40 creams in a box which I have purchased to control my terribly dry palms. None have really ever worked!  I don&#x27;t know if I actually have eczema or it just a case of chronic dry skin, but I have NEVER had relief like I am experiencing with the CeraVe.  Don&#x27;t know if because this cream contains hyaluronic acid or if it&#x27;s something else in it, but whatever the reason, I have thrown away all the other jars and bottles.  Finally!  Relief!!!</li>
    <li> Like this cream a lot. Absorbs quickly and does a good job moisturizing. Better than some others I have tried that cost more. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I have never had a product that keeps my poor dry winter skin so soft, moist, and for 2 days with one use. I have used this product for more than a year, now happy to have my second jar of it. Soon will order a third, just in case. You will never find a product works this well, and this particular size is the one with the right formulation.</li>
    <li> My legs were so dry and itchy from the winter...and when I say itchy that&#x27;s an understatement...one application of this product worked!! I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream in this price range for me. I usually use high end skin care, but I have found that this moisturizing cream is superior to many of them. As a fact, I have started using this as my main facial cream, or at least I will put on a layer of it after my other creams if I don&#x27;t only use it for my night routine. It is also very handy to have in the office. Hand, neck, face, feet, whatever you need moisturizing, this will do! Love it.</li>
    <li> The cream leaked and spill out from the container.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, no greasy feel after it dries. I have only used 5 days but skin does feel softer.</li>
    <li> Excellent for dry winter skin, also excellent service.</li>
    <li> Our daughter has ezcema and this was recommended by the Allergist(food allergies). Its amazing. She loves getting it put on and its making her skin so smooth compared to how scaley it was before. Also its a whole lot better than the vasaline treatment the previous doc had us on. this cream is wonderful!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a godsend. I&#x27;ve been trying to find the right moisturizer for years now and I&#x27;m so happy to have this tub of magic in my life now. A friend suggested I try this and it&#x27;s lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination dry and oily skin which is worse in the winter. Also the skin between my nostrils is seriously always dry and flaky. I have no idea why, but I&#x27;ve even slathered it in aquaphor before bed some nights and it doesn&#x27;t seem to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. My skin drinks it up like crazy. It&#x27;s so light and absorbs so well into my skin. It never feels like it&#x27;s settled on top of my skin like other moisturizers. My pores feel like they can breathe and that&#x27;s a good feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is completely oderless and non-greasy. The tub is a very generous size and I think it&#x27;s going to last me quite a while. I use this twice a day as part of my new skin care routine. Now that I&#x27;m in my 30s, I believe I should really be taking care of my skin. I think this will help a lot. In just a few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed visable and tangible benefits from using it.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry skin</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body cream by far, and I have been ordering it regularly for the last year and a half.  It is a great balance of being very moisturizing but not greasy.  My husband hates creams in general but will use this because the feel on your skin is not too heavy.  A lot of people even use it for their faces......but that didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t come in a pump option - that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m giving it four instead of five stars.  I bought a pump that fits on top, but honestly a tub is a terrible configuration for pumps - the pump stops working way before the cream is done.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer, stays on a long time and leaves my skin very silky but not oily.</li>
    <li> Great, healing moisture for the dry, dry, dry of New Mexico.</li>
    <li> This did not work for my skin, and caused me to break out badly. Am giving it to a friend who swears by it. The search continues for a non-comedegenic non-irritating moisturizer for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used the CeraVe Facial Lotion and Body lotion for a long time and decided to try this for winter time or when I need a little extra moisture..  I prefer this to the traditional brands commonly advertised.</li>
    <li> This was bought by my wife as she got a free sample at her skin surgeon. The cream is light and absorbs quickly. It seems to repair her dry skin on her hands by the second or third application. Great stuff! Recommend it for any person who has skin problems that other lotions or creams don&#x27;t work. Your price is good, too.</li>
    <li> This fast absorbing cream is perfect for my dry, sensitive skin.  I use it on my face in the morning and it absorbs quickly so I can apply my other products. I have extremely sensitive skin, especially in the winter, and CeraVe does not sting at all! A giant tub at a bargain price! I love it</li>
    <li> excellent moisturizer - thick and creamy - works wonders on winter skin</li>
    <li> Best cream I&#x27;ve used in a very long time.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this works perfectly. After use my skin feels soft and well hydrated.</li>
