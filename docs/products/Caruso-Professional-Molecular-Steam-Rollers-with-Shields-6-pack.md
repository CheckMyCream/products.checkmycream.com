      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>And I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>The hair-setter is amazing, I&#x27;ve had it for many years, mostly used for special occasions.</li>
      <li>Although, I did get good results from these curlers, the process ended up taking more time than I was willing to deal with day in and day out.  </li>
      <li>Rollers are so easy to use and hair is done in no time.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to mix the two.</li>
      <li>Your hair will be curly with this product ... easy to use and does what it says it will do.  </li>
      <li>Then I blast with cool air from blow dryer and top with hair spray.</li>
      <li>They are quick and easy to use, and give my hair lots of curl that lasts mostly all day.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it.  </li>
      <li>Did not curl fine hair.</li>
      <li>Would not recommend at all for fine hair.</li>
      <li>I was able to find them at Quick E Shop, through Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>In any case, I was really pleased with Quick E Shop.  </li>
      <li>I used a sharpie and filled in the label according to the size of each roller just to make things faster from then on for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The mollecular rollers leave my hair in great condition, unlike standard curling irons, and seems to hold longer!</li>
      <li>and it was super easy to use.</li>
      <li>I have some from my original purchase.  </li>
      <li>The original sponges disintegrated.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight hair</li>
      <li>, I guess I will bite the bullet and buy another Helen of Troy steamer and religiously clean it every month!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It would take three times as many rollers to get a decent style and a gigantic head to hold them all!</li>
      <li>I nneded to replace worn out rollers and really like the quality of these and plan to order more.</li>
      <li>The foam wears out quickly and I am left with a perfectly good roller...  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say how they would work for other types of hair, but for me, they are great.</li>
      <li>how quickly I got them.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the Caruso Molecular Steam System about 20 years ago and was very surprised to be able to find replacement rollers.</li>
      <li>Even using nothing but jumbo rollers on my hair, my fine hair really took the curl, almost too curly.  </li>
      <li>It takes 2 minutes to warm up and only 5-10 minutes to get your hair curled!  </li>
      <li>They gave her long locks a nice bounce full of body.</li>
      <li>The price was right also.</li>
      <li>I used the smaller curlers on my shorter hair just to see what it would do... and it actually looks great.</li>
      <li>So, if you go with the Caruso system, make sure to buy extra rollers.</li>
      <li>Regular curlers work better.</li>
      <li>it has compared to irons or hot curlers.</li>
      <li>I bought extra jumbo rollers anticipating the need for more.  </li>
      <li>I have had many through the years but always go back to Caruso.</li>
      <li>My hair falls into the first category.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much!  </li>
      <li>I was confuse at first because if you look at the shields and plastic part of the rollers it says &amp;</li>
      <li>This is not the first time I have replaced the foam part of the rollers.</li>
      <li>Followed the instructions exactly.</li>
      <li>Need to order more refills of this thick size.  :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what I needed - and at a reasonable price too. I purchased the Caruso Molecular Steam System about 20 years ago and was very surprised to be able to find replacement rollers. Thank you so much!  Donna</li>
    <li> I like the ionic mist curlers, but why can&#x27;t we buy just the foam part of the curler? The foam wears out quickly and I am left with a perfectly good roller...  I think it would be much more practical and less expensive. Guess they have got to squeeze our pocket just a little more.</li>
    <li> been using these for many years</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter, and we both love it.  It actually leaves your hair very shiny - no dryness or hair damage.  The steam makes great curls, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  Highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> My favorite hair rollers!  Love em!</li>
    <li> Several posts mention neeing only replacement foam - not the whole curler.  My set came with an accessory order card - it lists 4 sizes of replacement foams @ 70 cents each plus $6.50 shipping the whole order - this is an older set so prices may vary - try 800-942-2080 or write to Caruso at P O Box 151, Jenkintown, PA 19046</li>
    <li> Did not curl fine hair. Followed the instructions exactly. Actually, curled it and the curl straightened in a few minutes. Good idea, just didn&#x27;t work on my hair. Also had trouble with the curlers sliding out and dropping to the floor. Would not recommend at all for fine hair. Might be okay for heavily textured hair.</li>
    <li> I had this as a teenager years ago n loved it then and stl love it now. My curls really lasts long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used steam rollers for years and often get compliments.  It&#x27;s a little hard to set your hair for the first couple times but its definitely worth learning.  I have fine hair but a lot of it.  It takes me 10 minutes or so to set all my hair and by the time the last one is in, I start taking the first ones out.  Remove the remaining at about the same pace you put them on, or just wait 5 minutes and remove all at once.  I usually don&#x27;t have to set my hair again until after I wash it, which is two to three days later.  Have also used in humid environments and have similar success.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Caruso steam roller set in addition to the extra jumbo rollers. This set is not effective on thick hair. Here&#x27;s why: They don&#x27;t get hot enough, roll tight enough, or close enough to the scalp. It would take three times as many rollers to get a decent style and a gigantic head to hold them all! It may work for average thickness, and thin, fine hair. Those of us who need a root to tip smoothing out will not be satisfied with this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it. Maybe I&#x27;ll try a set of regular old hot rollers. In the meantime I&#x27;m stuck with the time consuming, pain in the butt flat  and curling irons.</li>
    <li> Your hair will be curly with this product ... easy to use and does what it says it will do.  Be sure and drain the old water daily and add new if you have hard water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairsetter for years and was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t find replacement rollers. It&#x27;s the greatest hair care product and I was thrilled to find this seller!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 12+ years. They hold a lot better than curling irons and do less damage than dry heat does. The foam does break down after a while. Can not find any locally and they are a bit expensive to purchase separately versus the price for steamer and rollers together.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m revising my review because it dawned on me yesterday after I wrote the below original review, that maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t curling because I use moroccan oil in my hair when it&#x27;s wet and then blow dry it and then use the curls. Today, I didn&#x27;t put any product in my hair and used t he curlers and my curls are AMAZING! So, I stand corrected. I retract my old review and replace it with 5 stars. They&#x27;ve lasted through the Florida humidity and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key Points&lt;br /&gt;-Common complaint is that the jumbo and large rollers are the same. They are NOT the same. The clip size is the same between the two, however the foam thickness is different. Put them side by side and you&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t use oil products in your hair if you&#x27;re going to use the curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t do oil treatments or heavy conditioners in your hair before using curlers. This includes Olive Oil hair wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review: I really wanted to like this product. I have long, very thick, semi-course hair and when I read all of the great reviews on this product, I was so excited to get it in the mail. After two weeks of using them daily with variations of time on the steamer, rolled with the clips that came with them or with regular roller clips, variations of time in my hair, used both with a blow dryer and without, used both with hair spray before curling, after, and non at all, etc. I can&#x27;t get my curls to last longer than a few minutes. Within a few minutes, I&#x27;m left with a frizzy, ugly mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not experienced with curlers because of my hair type, but I&#x27;m really disappointed with these. I am returning them and will try something else, probably just regular hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did want to note though that some people have said that it comes with 6 jumbo and 6 large and they they are one in the same size. They&#x27;re not. If you look, the clip and the width of the round plastic part of the roller are the same size, however the actual foam part is larger on the jumbo than on the large.on the jumbo than on the large.</li>
    <li> I have used the Caruso curler system for about 15 years, and was having a tough time finding replacement rollers. These are plastic and from repeated use, the outer clamp/shell can get dull and lose its hold. So, if you go with the Caruso system, make sure to buy extra rollers. I prefer the largest size possible for large waves/curls.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 20+ years.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have used my Caruso for years I am so glad I can get the replacement rollers for it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> as expected, bought to go with steam set. easy to use, nice results. Good price. Clips can leave a dent but no biggie just go over that with reg curling iron</li>
    <li> THis hair curling system is the best I have ever had or used. I have had many through the years but always go back to Caruso. I was so disappointed when I got out the old kit again and the foam part of the rollers had disintegrated. The rest of the kit is like New and works great!  I just happened to stumble on to the rollers and it made my day! I never thought I would find them again!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Caruso system for years. My mom used to use the old salt version on me when I was little. My hair doesn&#x27;t hold regular curl well, so I tried Caruso. LOVE it. I use it every day and people often ask me how I get my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Jumbo Rollers only, so I go through them quickly.  I ordered these and they appear a little different than the rollers that came with my last system. They are a little stiffer and seem to be made out of a bit of different material. They have a hint of a &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34; to these versus the older rollers I have. Overall, they seem to work as well, but I do wish they were a little softer. I still gave them 4 stars because they do still get the job done.</li>
    <li> Very nice. They&#x27;re good for what they do, I just wish the curls lasted longer than a couple of hours!</li>
    <li> I wish the regular set came with more jumbo rollers, but at least these are available.  They work very well.</li>
    <li> These roller&#x27;s foam is firm enough to keep the large curls large &amp; the caps fit snugly but aren&#x27;t too difficult to pull off.</li>
    <li> These rollers work very well with the Caruso steam hairsetter. I have some from my original purchase.  I just needed more.</li>
    <li> I used these and it is cumbersome and time consuming.  Plus the curl is awful.  I kept it because I had used it and threw away the box. It is just sitting in my closet.  Don&#x27;t get them</li>
    <li> The Jumbo roller and the Large rollers use the SAME size rollers and shield/clip but the FOAM are different sizes. The Jumbo&#x27;s foam obviously larger then the Large foam. I was confuse at first because if you look at the shields and plastic part of the rollers it says &amp;#34;JUMBO/LARGE&amp;#34; on it and without further inspection there&#x27;s not much to tell the difference between the Jumbo and Large size foam because they don&#x27;t really look that different from afar. It was easy to mix the two. Would have been nice if Caruso labeled them specifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that helps. I used a sharpie and filled in the label according to the size of each roller just to make things faster from then on for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the roller themselves. they are the same as the ones the steamer came with. Does what it supposed to do. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the shield/clip because half the time they don&#x27;t hold rollers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking to buying more rollers for your Caruso Steam Hairsetter, this is it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight hair and I used to use a steam curling iron.  I can no longer find that product, so decided to try these curlers.  I love them.  They are quick and easy to use, and give my hair lots of curl that lasts mostly all day.  I am very pleased with this system.  I can&#x27;t say how they would work for other types of hair, but for me, they are great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Caruso steam for years.  Less damage to my hair than hot rollers. I have thinning hair and double processed</li>
    <li> Love these rollers, my old ones were very dry and flaking. I hadn&#x27;t used them in years as I was wearing my hair very short. now that I have some length, I like curling it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have poker straight hair and this product gives me a long lasting curl. I had a very old set of these rollers and the foam disintegrated so I had to purchase new rollers. I expect them to last as many years as my last set.</li>
    <li> Great service. Timely shipping.  I have used this product for 20 years.  I just needed new rollers since the foam wears out every 5 years or so.  Great curls!</li>
    <li> Take to long. To much effort. Did not like at all. Did not like the steam and water. Regular curlers work better.</li>
    <li> I nneded to replace worn out rollers and really like the quality of these and plan to order more. Really happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing better than steam curlers!!  It takes 2 minutes to warm up and only 5-10 minutes to get your hair curled!  Love the item!</li>
    <li> These work better than any roller product I&#x27;ve ever tried!  My Caruso system is SO OLD (like from the 80&#x27;s) but it continues to work great!  I had to replace the rollers and that&#x27;s it!  I have thick, heavy hair and normally when I try to curl it, the curls just fall out from the weight of my hair.  When I use these steam rollers, the curls are so tight and they last for a couple of days (if I can get away without washing my hair for that long)!  Love it!  Would recommend this as a favorite!</li>
    <li> These rollers are made differently than the ones that came originally with the set. Not as well-made</li>
    <li> Love the curlers. Much cheaper than buying extra curlers from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The price of this product has continued to climb and they often don&#x27;t last long.  However, they have the corner on the market - I guess no one else is allowed to produce them.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without my steamer!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Richard Caruso molecular hairsetter for 15 years.  I would not dream of taking a curling iron to my hair.  These rollers with the steam hairsetter are a wonderful product that I would recommend to anyone who wants to curl their hair without damage.</li>
    <li> Nothing keeps the curl in my hair longer than Caruso steam rollers.  The curl from standard hot rollers lasts about 8 hours, but these keep a wave in my straight hair for days.  The only problem is the clips are not snug enough to keep my fine hair from slipping out sometimes.</li>
    <li> The mollecular rollers leave my hair in great condition, unlike standard curling irons, and seems to hold longer! I have used various sized rollers over the years, and they have never let me down!</li>
    <li> I already had an older steam roller system (the kind you add a little salt and water to), but only had a few original rollers. My daughter&#x27;s hair is down to her waist and the smaller rollers just didn&#x27;t cut it. So, I ordered these to see if they were better. They worked great! They gave her long locks a nice bounce full of body. I also tried them on my shoulder length hair and they did not disappoint. I loved the clips as they are very easy to use. I have found after checking other sites and reviews that the trick to using these is to only let them heat for a fee seconds. If you leave them on the steam too long, they  get damp and you hair will not set quickly, particularly if your hair is long and wounds around several times. Dry hair, quick steam, and let them sit in for as long as you have time. A little setting spray before you roll each roller can keep the curl longer, but even without them the curl is long-lasting.</li>
    <li> I have had a Caruso Molecular Hairsetter for almost 20 years and would not use anything else to roll my hair.  I ordered them from a TV commercial and to my amazement, they really worked!  You just steam the roller (takes a few seconds), roll your hair while the shield is steaming, place the shield over the curl, then steam another roller, etc..  As soon as you finish with the last curl, you can begin removing the rollers from your hair, beginning with the first curl you rolled.  The incredible thing is how quickly it curls your hair. It&#x27;s almost like magic!.  And the curls are soft and manageable.  The steamer that I have (which I purchased from Celeste Company, Inc of Elkins Park, Ps) requires that you add baking soda to the water (it came with a little mini-measuring spoon so you knew exactly how much baking soda to add) and it is still working.  A few years ago, I decided to buy another steamer in case my old one bit the dust.  It was, after all, getting up in years!  I purchased my second steamer from Helen of Troy L.P. of El Paso, TX.  It was smaller and so was easier to pack for trips.  It also did not require that you add anything to the water, so no need to take along any baking soda.  Unfortunately, It lasted only a few months.  Apparently, you are supposed to clean it once a month or so with a vinegar solution, which I neglected to do.  On the other hand, I&#x27;ve never cleaned my first steamer and it&#x27;s still going strong!  The only precaution I take is to change the water and add fresh baking soda each time I use it.  I was not happy with the Helen of Troy steamer.  I later did an internet search for Celeste Company, but apparently they&#x27;re no longer in business.  Too bad!  They strictly knew how to make steamers that lasts!  If push comes to shove and I have to, I guess I will bite the bullet and buy another Helen of Troy steamer and religiously clean it every month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam on my old rollers are wearing out, so I finally decided to go online tosee if I could find replacements.  I was able to find them at Quick E Shop, through Amazon.com.  It would be even better if I could replace just the foam inserts, because there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the plastic part of the rollers.  I think there was a time when you could buy just the foam inserts.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t take advantage of that opportunity when I had it.  In any case, I was really pleased with Quick E Shop.  They had the best price and I was really happy with the rollers they sent me and how quickly I got them.  I highly recommend them if you need to replace your Caruso steamer rollers.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace old rollers.</li>
    <li> okay so had tried hot rollers before and so was doing a lot of homework on amazon reviews to see which one I should get since I didn&#x27;t like the previous ones I used. I am sooooo glad I got this one! I just got them in the mail today and tried them...absolutely amazing results!!!! I got perfect wavy hair - no frizz- and it was super easy to use. I will definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was happy I could find these replacement rollers on Amazon.  The original sponges disintegrated.  The price was right also.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to replace my original steam hair rollers that dry rotted in my hair. Brought them in many sizes.</li>
    <li> The hair-setter is amazing, I&#x27;ve had it for many years, mostly used for special occasions. I would not trade it for another method. However in ordering needed new rollers the size of the rollers were not specifically clear. For one thing, I did not understand that both Jumbo and Large sized rollers are put on one same-sized frame with different sized sponges. This threw me off. Because of this lack of information I ordered six Jumbo thinking they were the Large rollers and twelve Large thinking they must be the medium-sized rollers. My order went to separate distributors which I also did not understand before ordering. I&#x27;m not a frequent online shopper and not very intuitive. I need things spelled out clearly up front. Even after great angst over what sizes to order I learned too late that when I thought I was ordering six large and twelve medium sized rollers I had it all wrong. The Jumbo rollers are useless to me, giving little curl or body when I can keep them from falling out of my hair. The Large are not much better, I have long but thin hair and the Jumbo case is too large for the sponge, so they work their way out too. Because I was confused and ordered the wrong sizes, I did not have the new rollers I wanted for the event I needed them for. I&#x27;ve now had to make a second order to get the right sized rollers for next time. Beyond the frustration and disappointment I have spent way too much time and money largely because of poorly developed product descriptions and ordering information.</li>
    <li> I bought these in addition to what came in the set, thinking that I may need it.  In the end I didn&#x27;t need the extra 6 pack, however will keep it for backup.  I found that the large and jumbo size that came in the set are the same size so you end up with 12.</li>
    <li> I just wanted this one size as opposed to a multi pack.  Glad Amazon had it and, at a good price!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how to make these rollers stay in place.  They are pretty much worthless to me- a pure waste of money.  Would not recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great price from this seller. Others see little difference between large and jumbo size and I wholeheartedly disagree. I have waist length hair and the jumbo work great.Not too loose or too tight curl quality. And the curls last and last.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the full Caruso set with which this is compatible.  Before I purchased the extra rollers, I read from others who had the same full set that it came with all sizes of rollers from small to jumbo.  They suggested that the original set did not include enough jumbo rollers, particularly if you have long or thick hair.  My hair falls into the first category.  :)  I&#x27;m really glad that I followed the other consumer&#x27;s advice.  Even using nothing but jumbo rollers on my hair, my fine hair really took the curl, almost too curly.  If I had used the small or medium curlers, I probably would have ended up looking like Annie!  These rollers are of high quality, and fun to use once you have mastered the art of putting the covers on.  I would definitely recommend purchasing these rollers at the same time that you purchase the complete Caruso kit.  That way, you will have enough jumbo curlers to cover your head right away!</li>
    <li> These take some finessing if you have long hair.  The curls absolutely stay, no problem... but you have to be careful how you roll each section, especially at the ends.  They can look mashed and mangled if you&#x27;re not careful.  It helped me to use a little bit of smoothing serum before rolling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought these, I had super long hair halfway down my back.  I was sick of it, and this was my last-ditch effort to love my hair again.  I bought extra jumbo rollers anticipating the need for more.  Although, I did get good results from these curlers, the process ended up taking more time than I was willing to deal with day in and day out.  A couple of weeks later, I chopped my hair... more than a foot... GONE!  I used the smaller curlers on my shorter hair just to see what it would do... and it actually looks great.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> These rollers will work OK, but the foam is mushy - not firm like the old foam rollers. So I know they will not last long.  I have had my hairsetter for YEARS - and I do mean years. And I LOVE it. This is not the first time I have replaced the foam part of the rollers. It used to be you could just order the foam, but now you have to order the entire roller (which is wasteful and environmentally unsound).  The foam on my old rollers was literally disintegrating so I had not choice.&lt;br /&gt;  These will work for awhile, but I can tell that the foam is not the quality of the older rollers, so I anticipate having to replace these down the road.</li>
    <li> Still working out the kinks in these for me. I have very long and very thick hair. I decided to order these based on another reviewer&#x27;s post about the curlers working very well on her long hair. After blow drying, I follow the instructions to use the curlers (I use a mix of jumbo, large, and medium). And leave them in for about 20min after application. Then I blast with cool air from blow dryer and top with hair spray. After removing the curlers, I just have a small 1 or 2 ring curl on the end of my hair and hours after, my curls fall flat :/ Attempted about 5x already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had a difficult time holding a curl, but I figured I would give this a shot with all the good reviews it had. I do like the product, especially the &#x27;less heat&#x27; it has compared to irons or hot curlers. I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> Love the Caruso steam rollers.  The only heat rollers that will keep my hair curled.  Rollers are so easy to use and hair is done in no time.  This size is the best for my hair.  Need to order more refills of this thick size.  :)</li>
    <li> Curls all day. Easy to use!</li>
    <li> The rollers keep my hair curled twice as long.</li>
