      <li>Love the smell of this perfume.</li>
      <li>I do love the bottle design, but it&#x27;s nothing something I will buy.</li>
      <li>i like the bottle its very unique and quite a shelf ornament.  </li>
      <li>and I love the light, floral scent that the perfume has.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s also bold , well done, bought this for my granny and mother !</li>
      <li>Such a good value.</li>
      <li>It has a sweet smell, with some subtle fruit undertones, I put it on around 8am and can still smell it around 3pm, so it works great for your work/school day!</li>
      <li>Item was shipped fast and my daughter loved it for a Christmas present.</li>
      <li>This is the first celebrity fragrance I have bought and it is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Not a huge Nicki fan but loved the smell of this parfum</li>
      <li>Brand new, arrived earlier than expected, and it smells so good!</li>
      <li>Smells like sugared oranges or grapefruit and really lasts quite a bit.  </li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>I would probably buy this for my daughter again since she likes it so much</li>
      <li>It smells better than what I expected.</li>
      <li>and she really loves it and uses it all the time</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>I use a ton of it in one use and the scent fades fast.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this fragrance, delicate yet still awakes the senses.</li>
      <li>I was astounded to see the same 3pc set for almost $30 when all I really wanted was the perfume anyways.</li>
      <li>However for the amount of money I paid (bought it because I live in England and the pound is about 1.6 times more expensive than dollars)</li>
      <li>After smelling this it blew me away this perfume by passed kim k,beyonce,some of Gucci stuff and even Versace ,for a first perfume she picked really nice base notes, it&#x27;s not to fruity</li>

<li> Some say it doesn&#x27;t last long, but I don&#x27;t know because my trick is to spray it in my hair.</li>
<li> So much larger than I expected, especially for the price.</li>
<li> The scent doesn&#x27;t stay on you that long.</li>
<li> Usually perfume will at least keep a solid scent on your clothes but this scent simply doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
<li> This is the one perfume I put on and my boyfriend pops his head in from the other room,</li>
<li> This perfume is at least 3 times the size for way less.</li>
<li> Very carefully packaged (crazy amount of bubble wrap).</li>

    <li> Smells great! I lovee my nicki minaj perfume and not bc she&#x27;s a celebrity. I get compliments on it everywhere I go from almost everyone. Some say it doesn&#x27;t last long, but I don&#x27;t know because my trick is to spray it in my hair. The follicles lock it in so it stays longer, smells great all day. This is the one perfume I put on and my boyfriend pops his head in from the other room, haha.</li>
    <li> Perfume is very strong..to heavy for spring and summer .will try to use it again in the fall. One to two sprays are enough.</li>
    <li> I use a ton of it in one use and the scent fades fast. Dont know why but I wouldnt recommend it. I use many perfumes that stay on alot longer</li>
    <li> It smells better than what I expected. The scent doesn&#x27;t stay on you that long. I do love the bottle design, but it&#x27;s nothing something I will buy. I received it as a gift.</li>
    <li> Smells like sugared oranges or grapefruit and really lasts quite a bit.  Scent stays on for about I&#x27;d say 5 hours until it starts to wear off.  Wonderful scent for the younger crowd!</li>
    <li> Great service and great product (:</li>
    <li> This is awesome and the scent is so good</li>
    <li> Item was shipped fast and my daughter loved it for a Christmas present. I am a customer for life. The smile on my daughters face was priceless. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> It was actually a Christmas gift for my grand-daughter and she really loves it and uses it all the time</li>
    <li> Brand new, arrived earlier than expected, and it smells so good! Thank you</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this perfume. However for the amount of money I paid (bought it because I live in England and the pound is about 1.6 times more expensive than dollars) it last maybe an hour. Usually perfume will at least keep a solid scent on your clothes but this scent simply doesn&#x27;t last. If it did-5 stars!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter she loves it.....i like the bottle its very unique and quite a shelf ornament.  I would probably buy this for my daughter again since she likes it so much</li>
    <li> Nevaeh loved the smell but she loves everything Nicki</li>
    <li> Scent is very nice , my daughter loved it :)</li>

    <li> So much larger than I expected, especially for the price. Very carefully packaged (crazy amount of bubble wrap). Such a good value. THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> Am a big fan of fragrances ! After smelling this it blew me away this perfume by passed kim k,beyonce,some of Gucci stuff and even Versace ,for a first perfume she picked really nice base notes, it&#x27;s not to fruity but it&#x27;s also bold , well done, bought this for my granny and mother ! By dbossjoseph868</li>
    <li> i love this product.  it was everything i hoped it would be.  it smells incredible without being too overpowering.  awesome!</li>
    <li> great item daughter loved it</li>
    <li> very happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> This is the first celebrity fragrance I have bought and it is well worth the money. It smells like happiness and makes me feel like a glittery fairy floating on a cotton candy cloud!

    <li> I gave this perfume as a Christmas present. It was for my tween daughter and I love the light, floral scent that the perfume has.</li>
    <li> WOW! This is Amazing! What a great price for such a great product. I recently received a 3pc set with this perfume as a gift for Christmas and I absolutely loved it. When I went looking for this product in stores I was astounded to see the same 3pc set for almost $30 when all I really wanted was the perfume anyways. This perfume is at least 3 times the size for way less. I&#x27;ve seen this same size advertised in stores for around $55. I absolutely love this fragrance, delicate yet still awakes the senses. Yay for Nicki!</li>
