      <li>Love it!!!!</li>
      <li>I bought it as a stippling brush, and it works great as a stippling brush.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still cute and applies makeup nicely!!!</li>
      <li>Provides good coverage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love!</li>
      <li>Real techniques brushes make up most of my brush collection because I find them EXcellent quality.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it would work too good as a bronzer brush, because it is super</li>
      <li>I honestly feel it is not the best holding the loose mineral powders</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s just my opinion, I&#x27;d prefer a more sleek look.</li>
      <li>Probably gonna try, maybe fits better for that.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect brush to apply foundation to your entire face.</li>
      <li>More like a stippling brush than a brush made for bronzing..</li>
      <li>Better than the $50 brushes at sephora.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the brush</li>
      <li>and it did an OK job</li>
      <li>It is a high quality brush for an exceptionally great price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a pretty good brush though.</li>
      <li>This product wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had hoped, but it&#x27;s still a good brush.  </li>
      <li>But it was engineered well, making it easy for you to replace the cap without difficulty.</li>
      <li>a nd i&#x27;vr experienced a tiny bit of bristles fallout with time.</li>
      <li>I own most of the Real Techniques brushes (don&#x27;t own the &amp;#34;Bold Metals collection&amp;#34; yet because it just came out) and this one i use it for loose powder when i am feeling oily in my T-Zone.</li>
      <li>Love all the Real Techniques brushes.  </li>
      <li>Duo fibers make it really soft and nice.  </li>
      <li>I love all Real Techniques brushes.</li>
      <li>fast shipping too :)</li>
      <li>I know it is a bronzer brush, but I use it sort of like a stippling brush because it is big enough to give you a flawless look.</li>
      <li>Soft and LOVE that it retracts and comes with a lid to keep it clean.</li>
      <li>good density and minimal shedding.</li>
      <li>Love the brush brissel are so soft upset that it came apart still very usable</li>
      <li>The quality of this brush is amazing, as is expected.  </li>
      <li>A small flaw for a good brush.</li>
      <li>Quality of the handle differs from others in the real techniques range...</li>
      <li>Real techniques are QUALITY.</li>
      <li>The pink retractable one is probably better.  </li>
      <li>I really really wanted one of these retractable brushes.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other Real Techniques brushes and love them.</li>
      <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t seem realistic for bronzer application.</li>
      <li>Also, the piece that slides up to collect the bristles is stamped &amp;#34;real techniques&amp;#34; all around, and I feel like it makes it look just a little cheap.  </li>
      <li>The brush is so soft and it applies makeup well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as soft as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>The brush is VERY large, and I have a small face, so it does take up a lot of real estate in my bag and on my face..  </li>

    <li> I use it for my bronzer as well as my setting powder. Soft and LOVE that it retracts and comes with a lid to keep it clean.</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had hoped, but it&#x27;s still a good brush.  I&#x27;ve purchased other Real Techniques brushes and love them.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect brush to apply foundation to your entire face. I know it is a bronzer brush, but I use it sort of like a stippling brush because it is big enough to give you a flawless look. The smaller foundation brushes I used before left a lot of streaks on my face, which I then had to buff them out with another brush. Now I just use this one and I love it.</li>
    <li> Provides good coverage.</li>
    <li> I really really wanted one of these retractable brushes.  Real techniques brushes make up most of my brush collection because I find them EXcellent quality.  When I saw they made retractable, I jumped on it!  The quality of this brush is amazing, as is expected.  Duo fibers make it really soft and nice.  My problem is the bristles are very long and it&#x27;s a bit more difficult to work with because of that.  I prefer a shorter, denser brush.  The cap is solid, I&#x27;ve had it in my bag about a week now and it hasn&#x27;t fallen off.  The brush is VERY large, and I have a small face, so it does take up a lot of real estate in my bag and on my face..  I used it to apply my bronzer and it did an OK job, basically I&#x27;ll settle for this &amp;#34;on the run&amp;#34; brush but prefer to use a different brush IF time allows.  Also, the piece that slides up to collect the bristles is stamped &amp;#34;real techniques&amp;#34; all around, and I feel like it makes it look just a little cheap.  That&#x27;s just my opinion, I&#x27;d prefer a more sleek look.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as soft as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Love all the Real Techniques brushes.  Was exactly as expected</li>
    <li> I love the brush and I hate the cap.  I would give this brush five stars except it has a clear plastic cap that is already showing a slight crack.  I still would buy it again though.  It is a heavy duty brush that can apply powdered foundation, face powder, and blush.  I really like it.  It is a high quality brush for an exceptionally great price.</li>
    <li> I like this brush and how it&#x27;s a duo fiber brush and that it blends well but it doesn&#x27;t pick up product that well. It&#x27;s still a pretty good brush though.</li>
    <li> Quality of the handle differs from others in the real techniques range...bristles are not as densely packed. More like a stippling brush than a brush made for bronzing..</li>
    <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t seem realistic for bronzer application.</li>
    <li> Not the best brush but not the worst. I own most of the Real Techniques brushes (don&#x27;t own the &amp;#34;Bold Metals collection&amp;#34; yet because it just came out) and this one i use it for loose powder when i am feeling oily in my T-Zone. I honestly feel it is not the best holding the loose mineral powders a nd i&#x27;vr experienced a tiny bit of bristles fallout with time. The pink retractable one is probably better.  The other day i watched on youtube a beauty blogger using this brush for foundation. Probably gonna try, maybe fits better for that.</li>
    <li> Love the brush brissel are so soft upset that it came apart still very usable just have to do some extra work to put it back</li>
    <li> I bought it as a stippling brush, and it works great as a stippling brush.&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t think it would work too good as a bronzer brush, because it is super soft.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike is the cap slides off too easy :(</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! It&#x27;s way bigger than I expected but it&#x27;s still cute and applies makeup nicely!!! It&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> I love all Real Techniques brushes. This included. But the retractable mechanism doesn&#x27;t seem to work well. It kept on closing it on itself when you try to use it. But it was engineered well, making it easy for you to replace the cap without difficulty. The brush is so soft and it applies makeup well. I&#x27;m  just not a fan of the retractable line. A small flaw for a good brush.</li>
    <li> good density and minimal shedding. Evenly distributes powder bronzer</li>
    <li> Better than the $50 brushes at sephora. Real techniques are QUALITY. fast shipping too :)</li>
