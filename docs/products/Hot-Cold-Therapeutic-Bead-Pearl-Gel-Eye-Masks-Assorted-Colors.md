### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best feature?</li>
      <li>If you need around your eyes cooled, these would be perfect.</li>
      <li>Very good!</li>
      <li>In all, good value!</li>
      <li>These work great for sinus headaches.&lt;br /&gt;Also, for vanity purposes they are great for puffiness around the eyes.</li>
      <li>I liked it and the shipping time was good.</li>
      <li>Love this for a headache!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>nice too if you have a headache and want it on your forehead.</li>
      <li>, they were for the hubby.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really more of a &amp;#34;Neutral&amp;#34; than a &amp;#34;it&#x27;s ok&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s not an option.</li>
      <li>These are nice if you just want cool comfort around your eyes.  </li>
      <li>The masks work fairly well for my puffy eyes-not 100% but good enough on most days.  </li>
      <li>They fit with a Velcro strap</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried with heat yet, but with cool, it seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;You can still see through them.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>My skin temperature doesn&#x27;t take long to warm them up after putting them in the fridge :).  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, a pretty good product &amp; value overall.</li>
      <li>My old ice masks finally gave out, so I was happy to find these on Amazon to help combat sinus headaches.  </li>
      <li>Also when its super hot</li>
      <li>It states to not put it in the freezer, but I have (not for very long) and it was nice too on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have another one that is bigger and works better.</li>
      <li>It freezes pretty well, but I have not tried to heat it.</li>
      <li>Husband&#x27;s used these after his eyebrow lift surgery, and they really helped his eyes heal.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really use them though</li>
      <li>The eye opening allows the wearer to see while wearing - very convenient for watching TV.</li>
      <li>eye masks work very well.  </li>
      <li>My only major issue is that for me I need the mask to fit snugger right under my eyes-</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t stay cool for very long, but it is nice for the little while it lasts.  </li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t enough beads to push out the bottom and top enough to touch your lids.</li>
      <li>The little gel beads are pretty cool.</li>
      <li>The beads inside would congregate in areas of low pressure on the face, causing the most swollen areas to get little or no treatment.</li>
      <li>Though I was hesitant buying this item after reading some of the negative reviews, I&#x27;m glad we did.</li>
      <li>The beads inside quickly smash after a few freeze thaw cycles.</li>
      <li>I must have a huge head, because I have to pull the straps very tight to get enough of the velcro together for it to stay strapped on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because they warm up rather quickly (from the fridge though, too icy cold straight from the freezer), and my kid wishes the Velcro strap was a little longer.  </li>
      <li>If you have a large head, these may not fit properly.  </li>

    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried with heat yet, but with cool, it seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;You can still see through them.&lt;br /&gt;3 stars because the plastic edging is a little sharp, the clasp in back is a little weird, it&#x27;s heavy on your face and combined with the strap being thin it doesn&#x27;t stay in place all that well.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use them though, they were for the hubby.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really more of a &amp;#34;Neutral&amp;#34; than a &amp;#34;it&#x27;s ok&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s not an option.</li>
    <li> I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I&#x27;ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for an upcoming eye surgery. Instructions say to only freeze up to 30 mins. They do not stay cold very long at all and not worth trouble or money.</li>
    <li> Only last about 5 minutes once applied.  DON&#x27;T BUY!.</li>
    <li> Though I was hesitant buying this item after reading some of the negative reviews, I&#x27;m glad we did. The best feature? The eye opening allows the wearer to see while wearing - very convenient for watching TV. Used it to recover from nose surgery and it&#x27;s cold. Bought the 3-pack to rotate from freezer to face. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with the plastic enclosure breaking yet. In all, good value!</li>
    <li> eye masks work very well.  Especially when chilling them to cool eyes.  Husband&#x27;s used these after his eyebrow lift surgery, and they really helped his eyes heal.  His doctor thought they would work well.</li>
    <li> My old ice masks finally gave out, so I was happy to find these on Amazon to help combat sinus headaches.  I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because they warm up rather quickly (from the fridge though, too icy cold straight from the freezer), and my kid wishes the Velcro strap was a little longer.  If you have a large head, these may not fit properly.  Otherwise, a pretty good product &amp; value overall.</li>
    <li> I love it! I can still  see through the eye holes while I wear it.</li>
    <li> I liked it and the shipping time was good.</li>
    <li> Very good! I use almost everyday when I go to sleep or when I wake up.</li>
    <li> The masks work fairly well for my puffy eyes-not 100% but good enough on most days.  My only major issue is that for me I need the mask to fit snugger right under my eyes-I end up having to press on it and hold it down a bit in a few spots close to my eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought these for post-op swelling and the masks are hard and rigid, the last thing you would want on swollen and sensitive areas. The beads inside would congregate in areas of low pressure on the face, causing the most swollen areas to get little or no treatment. The beads also broke after only one use. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are nice if you just want cool comfort around your eyes.  They don&#x27;t stay cool for very long, but it is nice for the little while it lasts.  My skin temperature doesn&#x27;t take long to warm them up after putting them in the fridge :).  It states to not put it in the freezer, but I have (not for very long) and it was nice too on my skin.  They fit with a Velcro strap and so you can make it snug or loose..nice too if you have a headache and want it on your forehead.</li>
    <li> Love this for a headache! Also when its super hot and you want to relax.</li>
    <li> If you need around your eyes cooled, these would be perfect. If you want the tops or bottom of your eyelids iced, these don&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve tried lots of stuff to keep my eyes cooled, and was hopeful on these and ordered a 3 pack. The beads inside quickly smash after a few freeze thaw cycles. There aren&#x27;t enough beads to push out the bottom and top enough to touch your lids. I&#x27;m sure they work for some people, but for me, they are useless, and the quality seems a little lacking. I must have a huge head, because I have to pull the straps very tight to get enough of the velcro together for it to stay strapped on. I only use these if I&#x27;ve ran out of other bags.</li>
    <li> They work, but are a little small and don&#x27;t stay cold very long.  I have another one that is bigger and works better.</li>
    <li> These work great for sinus headaches.&lt;br /&gt;Also, for vanity purposes they are great for puffiness around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I ordered these masks since I use the hot/ cold gel masks frequently for sinus headaches.  On the back of the package it stated it could be put in the fridge or freezer for 30 minutes.  I put 2 of them in the freezer and after putting them on my face, they both split at the bottom and the gel beads fell out all over me and the bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller and they said it could not be placed in the freezer.  This is not what it stated on the back of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I should get a refund, but can not get a response from the seller which was Global Depot.</li>
    <li> The little gel beads are pretty cool. It freezes pretty well, but I have not tried to heat it.</li>
