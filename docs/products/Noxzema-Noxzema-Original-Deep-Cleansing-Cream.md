      <li>It&#x27;s a classic for a reason.</li>
      <li>So when I tried it, it gave a really refreshing feeling when I put it on and made my face feel really cool, but the next day I found myself breaking out into small pimples</li>
      <li>New formula</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not like it was hot outside to cause it to liquefy.</li>
      <li>, i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have extremely sensitive skin or what, but it said that it was &#x27;dermatologist tested&#x27;</li>
      <li>An old school gem.</li>
      <li>In other words, they made a conscious decision to use 45% more plastic for 4 years to cover up giving consumers nearly 15% less product than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>Feels great on skin (especially after a long or difficult day....</li>
      <li>I read recently someone mentioned they used Noxzema to clear it up.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my son loves it, cant beat the price lasts a long time - saved me a trip to the store</li>
    <li> I have had eczema behind both ears for over 2 years and nothing would clear it up. I read recently someone mentioned they used Noxzema to clear it up. I swiftly ordered the 12 oz (2 Pack) and in less than a week it has cleared up! Now, if I feel the slightest itch I apply the Noxzema and it stops the itching. I hope this helps others who suffer as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a classic for a reason. Gives you nice, clean skin with just a hint of tingle.</li>
    <li> I loved it now I am back to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Noxzema Original Cleansing Cream is the best!!!  I have been using it for years, so has my mother.  People always ask me how do I keep my face so smooth.  I was sick of spending so much money on every product out there.  Noxzema works just as good if not better.  How can you go wrong when generation have been using it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> 2 cans of noxzema. Do the math it&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> Classic clean indeed.  I have used this product for years.  I especially find myself gravitating to this product in winter months.  I like a good fresh feeling without over drying.  I have tried products ten times the price of this and somehow always find myself coming back.  What I also love is that this product has been on the marked for decades.  It doesn&#x27;t say anything like &amp;#34;now paraben free&amp;#34;.  Wanna know why?  Because they never used them!  Before the paraben scare went mainstream, Noxzema wasn&#x27;t using them.  Well, not in this product from what I can tell.  Pretty happy this was a go to when I was young!</li>
    <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using Noxzema for 10+ years and my complexion is great because of it.</li>
    <li> New formula but seems the same to me!  couldn&#x27;t find in local stores</li>
    <li> Great deal, you get two BIG containers for an awesome price!</li>
    <li> I bought mine at my local drugstore because my cousin recommended it to me and it thought about giving it a try since all of his acne went away. So when I tried it, it gave a really refreshing feeling when I put it on and made my face feel really cool, but the next day I found myself breaking out into small pimples so I thought it was just because of my monthly cycle coming up so I continued using it until I realized that it was this product that broke me out, i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have extremely sensitive skin or what, but it said that it was &#x27;dermatologist tested&#x27; so I just tried it. But after 2 uses, I ended up just giving it to my cousin hehe.</li>
    <li> Started using Noxzema at 10, thats more than 1/2 a century now, I have great skin, in spite of a sun loving outdoorsy life, genetics, not smoking and noxzema I&#x27;m sure gave me good skin.</li>
    <li> jars broken and open and had to just throw it all away...&lt;br /&gt;very bad purchase that surprised me, i am generally very happy&lt;br /&gt;with Amazon..&lt;br /&gt;Mike OKeefe</li>
    <li> the same as my Grandmother used many years ago.  Still makes my skin look great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man who uses this product to wash my face in the morning and evening. I started using it over a decade ago after reading a review by a woman on another site who compared the difference in her face to that of her sister after using it for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, I noticed when the product went from 14 ounces to 12 ounces in 2011 but the size of the package did not change. A little investigation revealed a false bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the makers of Noxema have gone to a right-sized container and are touting &amp;#34;45% less plastic.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In other words, they made a conscious decision to use 45% more plastic for 4 years to cover up giving consumers nearly 15% less product than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars because I like the product but dislike the company&#x27;s business practices.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use Noxzema for years and years and years. I am now 68 years old been using it since I was a teen.  I&#x27;ve not purchased this product from Amazon in the past but will in the future now that I know they carry it.  I&#x27;ve recently turned by grandchildren onto this product and they love it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff. I&#x27;ve used it since the sixties (along with a rotation of other skin products) and still have great skin now in my fifties. Great nourishing, cleansing, and refreshing cleanser. Removes make-up very well. Feels great on skin (especially after a long or difficult day....very energizing and refreshing). Cool and tingly in the summer....great on sunburned areas. I&#x27;m now passing it down to the next generation of adolescents who are interested in skin care, cosmetics, and care of acne-prone skin.  (BTW:  this is the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; version of the product....and still the best, IMO)</li>
    <li> I am happy with my order!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Noxzema on my face every morning for 50 years.  Enough said!</li>
    <li> Skin feels so smooth and soft after this.</li>
    <li> Great cleaning cream, I use it to remover make up. It is the same formula from decades ago, and the smell and feel are wonderful. Not greasy and minty. An old school gem.</li>
    <li> I have used it almost all my life. It has always kept my skin clean, clear, and feeling good.</li>
    <li> Great for cleansing the face</li>
    <li> I love the smell and minty sensation this gives. It didn&#x27;t break me out and was effective but it is a bit of a hassle to use in my opinion because it&#x27;s a bit unsanitary to be dipping your hand into a tub that you use for weeks.</li>
    <li> love it, have used this since I was a teenager, it works</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  It&#x27;s just like what I used in my younger days.  I&#x27;m glad I can get it via Amazon!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Great price.</li>
    <li> I love Noxzema but realized I can buy it at the drugstore for the same price.</li>
    <li> Love my not email,  same scent I remember from childhood and excellent cleansing.  Came in a 2 pack,  12oz jars,  excellent price,  will def buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this old-aged stuff! You can hardly find this exact tub in stores, so ordering it (in pairs) always is my first idea. The sellers shipped really fast too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two medium sized tubs last about 4-6 months for me!</li>
    <li> As always, from the day of order to delivery was ahead of scheduled. This product is indispensable for my skin needs and many others seeing its results on me, want to get and use it as well . As a professional geologist working in a harsh out door environment my skin is like a twenty year old man instead of my eighty fives years.</li>
    <li> Noxema cleaning cream is a great product, cleanses my face and smells great.  I recommend this product</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with a dry skin problem, and it appears to work better than any off the counter creams and ointments I&#x27;ve purchased.  I like this a whole lot.</li>
    <li> Great stuff...  Use primarily for face.  Put some on 1st thing, followed by shower routine, last thing to rinse off.  This &amp; real aloe vera gel with tea tree oil @ night keep clean &amp; looking... younger, better</li>
    <li> very effective cleansing cream</li>
    <li> When this product arrived it had liquified &amp; leaked out a little into the plastic bag the containers were tied up in. Not sure what caused this. I ordered it in February so it&#x27;s not like it was hot outside to cause it to liquefy. As a result the cream inside was left in an odd cottage cheese like consistency. It still smelled the same &amp; it appears to work as expected but it looks funny as a result of the liquefying of the crime.</li>
