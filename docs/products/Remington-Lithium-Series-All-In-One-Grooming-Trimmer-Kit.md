### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I bought it just to trim my side burns.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps a great charge!</li>
      <li>However it will be perfect if it&#x27;s waterproof</li>
      <li>It works great!</li>
      <li>Very happy with this model.</li>
      <li>Awesome for the price.</li>
      <li>very good and efficient</li>
      <li>Works great for taking off all kinds of man scaping.</li>
      <li>Works great on all areas on the body.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>, the storage for the attachment pieces isn&#x27;t that great, and neither is the product storage for the unit itself.</li>
      <li>The guides for beard trimming aren&#x27;t great</li>
      <li>Great value for the price.</li>
      <li>This is great body hair trimmer.</li>
      <li>Great buy at a great price.</li>
      <li>Good trimmer.</li>
      <li>Its good ...</li>
      <li>I love this thing!</li>
      <li>this one is built much better!</li>
      <li>A travel case would have been a nice feature.</li>
      <li>Nice product, light weight and very handy to carry while traveling.</li>
      <li>the just the quality of it is great my hubby used it for the first time and loved it he is loving it</li>
      <li>and thats the first time he has been happy about any product</li>
      <li>The battery life is much more, i believe upto an hour.  </li>
      <li>If I ever grow a beard I would use it for sure.  </li>
      <li>To pulling and nice clean shave.</li>
      <li>Product arrived in good condition, works very well!</li>
      <li>I bought this because I wanted a nice, organized trimmer set, but none of the attachments fit securely on this stand.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this product gives you really fantastic value for the money and for the innovative, rake-style body trimmer attachment alone</li>
      <li>The blades are smooth and the design is very good to cover almost entire body.</li>
      <li>As a body groomer it seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It comes with amazing accessories and it works great on head to almost down there.</li>
      <li>It really does a nice job.</li>
      <li>But the basic groomer is good.</li>
      <li>The charge seems to last a good amount of time.  </li>
      <li>base is very nice and can keep all attachments while being stable so things are not falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an excellent product with reasoanble price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great little buy and seems sturdy.</li>
      <li>The attachments don&#x27;t allow one to trim hair smooth or even really close.  </li>
      <li>it is worth twice the price.</li>
      <li>The body trimmer is great for the lightning fast close trim on torso and you can detail that with the foil shaver (not really meant for your beards guys).</li>
      <li>and they all fall right off of the stand and all over the counter.</li>
      <li>First initial charge takes only three hours and works great.</li>
      <li>This trimmer isn&#x27;t exactly what I had hoped it to be as a Remington product.</li>
      <li>i really love this product its light weight not to heavy in your hand and</li>
      <li>I ended up with a patch of skin in my beard and had to shave the whole thing off and start over.  </li>
      <li>I really like the handle though.  </li>
      <li>Holds a charge really well.</li>
      <li>My other Remington razor is NiCd but cuts much better.</li>
      <li>Had an older version...</li>
      <li>Very handy little groomer, small enough for travel and accessories are easily interchangeable.</li>
      <li>These are great product pictures, unfortunately, this is nothing like what this will look like sitting on your bathroom counter.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t trim as well as my old model.</li>
      <li>The hair groomer isn&#x27;t really useable unless you have short hair but seems to work well.</li>
      <li>only downside is for real personal grooming, you can go ahead and put this one away and pull out the unbeatable Japanese Clean Cut</li>
      <li>which seems to be the same except that the older model had a nicer bronze/taupe colour.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the most frustrating product that I have bought this year.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s LOUD and the battery life is long but who cares when it doesn&#x27;t work?</li>
      <li>The storage unit doesn&#x27;t really store anything because if it is touched ever so slightly, everything falls out and the unit itself just lays in the middle of the inadequate storage unit causing it to be accidentally knocked off the counter a lot as well.</li>

<li> Well built, long charge and multiple accessories.</li>
<li> new version is defintiely much better as the charging cable can be connected directly to the trimmer instead of fitting it into the base at an awkward angle.</li>
<li> the parts break easily - and are replaceable....  not impressed with the mess when cleaning...</li>
<li> as expected no problems</li>
<li> The base is kind of cheap, which was disappointing.</li>
<li> Remington, you have let me down.</li>
<li> /&gt;Great for trimming my beard but bad for shaving... Not bad for the price of $20.</li>
<li> so I use a beard trimmer to leave a little length when I shave.  </li>
<li> After I stopped crying.</li>
<li> The blades were still doing well and would have worked for another few years.&lt;br</li>
<li> I usually plug mine in to charge when i&#x27;m not using it</li>
<li> Also the adjustable length attachment is hard to work.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t purchase from amazon, but this thing sucks.</li>
<li> Unlike previous Remington trimmers this unit does not have the ability to nestle and charge, it only lays on the provided base and you must plug the unit in manually.  </li>
<li> This razor does a very bad job cutting quickly or close when used like that.  </li>
<li> can shave my moustache while it&#x27;s peach fuzz without cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Everytime I try and cut my beard it stops and gets bound up when it starts cutting hair.</li>
<li> /&gt;I am however disappointed in the foil shaver.</li>
<li> Very bad at cutting hairs close to the skin.  </li>
<li> The stand is worthless, so plan on the attachments being dumped into a drawer, where you can fish for them when you need them.</li>
<li> The battery life is awful</li>
<li> TERRIBLE.</li>
<li> This is a piece of crap!  </li>
<li> Horrible design.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim as well as my old model.</li>
    <li> i really love this product its light weight not to heavy in your hand and the just the quality of it is great my hubby used it for the first time and loved it he is loving it and thats the first time he has been happy about any product thank you Remington</li>
    <li> It works great! I bought it just to trim my side burns.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps a great charge!</li>
    <li> Got it for a Christmas gift</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years. The battery life was dismal. It&#x27;s at the point now were the charge only lasts for seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone. The guides for beard trimming aren&#x27;t great either.&lt;br /&gt;It does not work while plugged in.</li>
    <li> I like it. However it will be perfect if it&#x27;s waterproof</li>
    <li> This is a piece of crap!  The adjustable guide does not stay in place when you set it for hair length.  It collapses to the shortest length with the slightest pressure.  I ended up with a patch of skin in my beard and had to shave the whole thing off and start over.  If I could, I would sue this company for putting out such a piece of sh*t product!</li>
    <li> the parts break easily - and are replaceable....  not impressed with the mess when cleaning...</li>
    <li> First initial charge takes only three hours and works great.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this model. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> This is great body hair trimmer. The blades are smooth and the design is very good to cover almost entire body. There are sufficient attchments to cover the various hair lenghts and the trimming requirements. I had its predecessor PG520 for about 10 years until its battrey gave up. The blades were still doing well and would have worked for another few years.&lt;br /&gt;The new version is defintiely much better as the charging cable can be connected directly to the trimmer instead of fitting it into the base at an awkward angle. The battery life is much more, i believe upto an hour.  And yes, you can use it while the charging cable is connected.&lt;br /&gt;The base is very nice and can keep all attachments while being stable so things are not falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an excellent product with reasoanble price.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! or rather it&#x60;s predecessor, the PG520 which seems to be the same except that the older model had a nicer bronze/taupe colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with amazing accessories and it works great on head to almost down there. The body trimmer is great for the lightning fast close trim on torso and you can detail that with the foil shaver (not really meant for your beards guys). The wider trimmer with combs also allows you to trim up in between haircuts with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is for real personal grooming, you can go ahead and put this one away and pull out the unbeatable Japanese Clean Cut trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product gives you really fantastic value for the money and for the innovative, rake-style body trimmer attachment alone it is worth twice the price.</li>
    <li> very good and efficient</li>
    <li> cuts well for what it is.  all the attachments are a bonus.</li>
    <li> The attachments don&#x27;t allow one to trim hair smooth or even really close.  The attachments don&#x27;t stay put on the storage tray.</li>
    <li> Its good ...as expected no problems</li>
    <li> Great buy at a great price.</li>
    <li> These are great product pictures, unfortunately, this is nothing like what this will look like sitting on your bathroom counter. I bought this because I wanted a nice, organized trimmer set, but none of the attachments fit securely on this stand. You put them all in place, (if you can even get them all standing) and the slightest touch and they all fall right off of the stand and all over the counter. This is the most frustrating product that I have bought this year. The stand is worthless, so plan on the attachments being dumped into a drawer, where you can fish for them when you need them. Shame on You Remington, you have succeeded in tricking me again!</li>
    <li> Very handy little groomer, small enough for travel and accessories are easily interchangeable. Does just about any grooming job you have. The hair groomer isn&#x27;t really useable unless you have short hair but seems to work well. It&#x27;s great little buy and seems sturdy. Just what I needed for my never ending travels.</li>
    <li> As a body groomer it seems to work fine. I usually plug mine in to charge when i&#x27;m not using it so battery isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am however disappointed in the foil shaver. I was looking for something all in one that could help shave as well but the foil shaver just doesn&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for trimming my beard but bad for shaving... Not bad for the price of $20.</li>
    <li> This trimmer isn&#x27;t exactly what I had hoped it to be as a Remington product. My husband states that it doesn&#x27;t cut as well as his last one, the storage for the attachment pieces isn&#x27;t that great, and neither is the product storage for the unit itself. The storage unit doesn&#x27;t really store anything because if it is touched ever so slightly, everything falls out and the unit itself just lays in the middle of the inadequate storage unit causing it to be accidentally knocked off the counter a lot as well. The battery life is awful so it has to stay plugged in or it will be dead when my husband is ready to use it. I definitely would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This trims anything. Well built, long charge and multiple accessories. A travel case would have been a nice feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, who seems to like it.  The charge seems to last a good amount of time.  I tried it on my legs and it was only &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s made for.  I really like the handle though.  If I ever grow a beard I would use it for sure.  After I stopped crying.</li>
    <li> Works great for taking off all kinds of man scaping. To pulling and nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> Horrible design.  Unlike previous Remington trimmers this unit does not have the ability to nestle and charge, it only lays on the provided base and you must plug the unit in manually.  Will probably return.  Remington, you have let me down.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t purchase from amazon, but this thing sucks. Everytime I try and cut my beard it stops and gets bound up when it starts cutting hair. Don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Very bad at cutting hairs close to the skin.  I get in-growns when I shave with a regular razor so I use a beard trimmer to leave a little length when I shave.  This razor does a very bad job cutting quickly or close when used like that.  My other Remington razor is NiCd but cuts much better.</li>
    <li> I use it to groom my cat.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> Nice product, light weight and very handy to carry while traveling. It really does a nice job.</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t get long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can shave my moustache while it&#x27;s peach fuzz without cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10</li>
    <li> Had an older version...this one is built much better! Awesome for the price.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE. This does not work. It&#x27;s LOUD and the battery life is long but who cares when it doesn&#x27;t work?</li>
    <li> Product arrived in good condition, works very well!</li>
    <li> The body hair attachment does not work all that well. Also the adjustable length attachment is hard to work.</li>
    <li> Works great on all areas on the body.&lt;br /&gt;All in one solution for a trimmer.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer. Some of the attachments seem pointless/cheap (like the foil one). But the basic groomer is good. Holds a charge really well. The base is kind of cheap, which was disappointing. All in all, I would buy this a gift for a friend.</li>
