    <li> this works great.  i bought them with the gigi hot wax.  it was such a good buy that i will be getting more</li>
    <li> These are way better than the woven version.</li>
    <li> Came on time and was exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> These strips are like the ones that come in the Sally Hansen wax kit. They have a soft, fuzzy texture. I love how they come with 200 strips in an order. The Sally Hansen wax kit brings too little so I&#x27;m left with a lot of wax and no strips. But overall these strips are awesome.</li>
    <li> Works well with gigi hard wax. I love it .&lt;br /&gt;I was almost discouraged by the negative reviews. DONT&lt;br /&gt;1) apply the gigi hard wax  to the area concerned (in a reasonable amount. Not too much nor too little ) and immediately press the strip flat on the wax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) let the wax cool off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) THEN RIP.</li>
    <li> These work extremely well. If you smooth them down in the right direction and rip in the right direction the hair should come of cleanly with one shot using these strips. I use them on myself with ease.</li>
    <li> I ordered two but I received only one pack. I am not satisfied.</li>
    <li> These are very large if that what you want.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if its the strip or the wax but it wont pull the hair that well. This was the first time I purchased from Amazon and not that happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been very pleased with how well the strips stick to wax. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Very good one. I like these better than the muslin strips I got with the waxing kit. They are non-sticky and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great value. I love the size of these because you can cut them to whatever size or shape you need. These will last a very long time.</li>
