<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Graet price and value</li>
    <li> I have discovered over the years that I can only use Neutrogena products on my face (foundations, powders, face washes, and wipes). I have sensitive skin but it is also oily and prone to acne at the same time, and this scrub is the only face wash I have found that will take off all of my makeup with just a dime-sized dollop and leave my skin squeaky clean and prevent and treat pimples without drying it out too much. I would be devastated if they ever stopped making this - customer for life.</li>
    <li> This actually made me breakout instead. I used the cream one for spot treating and thought this might work as well it did not. Couldn&#x27;t spot treat so I used it properly I broke out ALL over my face. My friends used to be jealous because I rarely have two pimples at a time now my face is covered! Not a happy camper. Thanks stores nearby for stocking this overpriced crap. (In the picture they were already popped but you can still see remnants of a few)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years and really enjoy it. It contains salicylic acid, which is great for fighting acne. The beads help exfoliate, and it also smells great.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have had alot of recent breakouts which is new for me. I have even seen a dermatologist for recommendations. Microderm creams and facials were not clearing up my skin. This wash has cleared up all my skin toned acne bumps and blemishes within 4 days! You do need to a use a light non greasy moisturizer like Cetaphil. I also use a pink grapefruit vitamin c gel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne and oily skin my whole life and this product really helps.</li>
    <li> This scrub leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean without over-drying. It does not contain excessive exfoliating material, so it is relatively gentle on my skin. The scent is also refreshing. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my forties, and still battle oil and acne.  This is the best face wash I have used.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and it helps control my acne.</li>
    <li> Works very well, wife and I both use it. We gave a tube to a friend and she loves it to.</li>
    <li> I used to use this years ago and they must have changed some ingredient as it made me breakout and swell.</li>
    <li> Son uses this product for his face and it is the only product, outside of prescriptions which are very costly, that keep his acne under control. We stopped paying hundreds of dollars for prescriptions and this and the Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash is all he now uses.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for almost a decade. I started using it for my acne at a younger age, and it seemed to help with blemishes more than using another kind of face wash. But now, several years later, I find that it doesn&#x27;t help with my adult acne but I continue to use it because it is affordable enough, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I like the smell, and the exfoliation.</li>
    <li> An aesthetician suggested this to me several years ago. I have been using it daily ever since. Try it. I have combination skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have been using this for several years with good results. Good for quick face wash or with regular bath.</li>
    <li> Love this acne wash scrub. I am 51 years old, and for some reason have started getting adult acne. Saw this and thought I would try it. I sure am glad I did. It says its a scrub, but it is very gentle. Oh and the smell is an added bonus. It has really helped my acne, and in a gentle way.&amp;#60;was also a great value&amp;#62;. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great face scrub. Great for the price paid for.</li>
    <li> More often than not left my face red and dry. Getting a &amp;#34;microbead&amp;#34; in your eye can be extremely painful and very hard to remove.</li>
    <li> Works Great.  Have been using for years now.  no reason to explore other products.</li>
    <li> I like the grapefruit face wash.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this it seems to work for him and does not have the bleaching effect like some other acne products. We have had towels and some clothing ruined from other products. This works fine.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> this is the only product my family can use that does not dry their very oily skin out.</li>
    <li> great price.. great product. have used for years.</li>
