      <li>They are more like the Ah Bra.</li>
      <li>Most comfortable bra ever!  </li>
      <li>but OMG I love it.</li>
      <li>If you are going to try them out, the 3/set is not too much more than a 2/set in store.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really more of a demi-cut bra.</li>
      <li>The fabric is not sturdy or supportive.</li>
      <li>I have purchased these at department stores and they weren&#x27;t the same, but these are great!</li>
      <li>The picture gives you the impression this bra is very full coverage in the front</li>
      <li>I love the way they fit, but the pads in the pockets have a tendency to slide around and fold over in the washer  and dryer.  </li>
      <li>It came very quickly and as advertised in the photograph and caption.  </li>
      <li>Can purchase &amp; replace pads easily.  </li>
      <li>Easy to put on and the shoulder straps don&#x27;t &amp;</li>
      <li>The removable pads slip around a bit, but are fairly easy to&lt;</li>
      <li>It light weight and gives a smooth fit under your clothes.</li>
      <li>I never thought the Genie Bra would be this comfortable</li>
      <li>The seams are already ripping and the inserts are cheaply made and fall out during the wash.</li>
      <li>She said the were comfortable.</li>
      <li>The bras are really comfortable.</li>
      <li>But, if you are like me and want to wash them to keep them clean...</li>
      <li>These bras are super comfortable and still give you some shape.  </li>
      <li>I received them really fast and ladies let me tell you, you will love this bra.</li>
      <li>I read reviews for these all over about them being true to size.</li>
      <li>nothing else is true...</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>BRAS WERE NICE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY CAME</li>
      <li>(she had a stroke) and she needs an easy on and off bra, but at 74 years old, she wants a full coverage bra</li>
      <li>I think they would work better for someone on the smaller side</li>
      <li>On a positive note, they also hold your &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Like another reviewer pointed out when I was reading these reviews before buying, I am pretty sure that these are not real genie bras.</li>
      <li>Thank you for you fast shipment.</li>
      <li>and I order the XL and it fits very well.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t provide as much support.</li>
      <li>They are not nearly as nice or supportive as the original genies that I got from Target for 2 for $20.</li>
      <li>They did not seem to come back to their original shape.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re slightly padded, stay in place and are very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>This is a quality company theat distributes a high quality product.</li>
      <li>Again though, my other and older genies, are still going strong.</li>
      <li>The front was much lower cut which does not support me completely.</li>
      <li>They have survived many a washing with only a few elastics coming through which I clip off easy enough.</li>
      <li>The size I chose should&#x27;ve been large for me but it was super tight.</li>
      <li>Therefore l get an XL.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfy and natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Not the same fabric as a real genie bra.</li>
      <li>While my real genies have held up for twice as long, I am throwing these away.</li>
      <li>the shoulder straps have stretched too much on these..</li>
      <li>usually recommend Genie Bras to everyone as they are comfortable and</li>
      <li>my original ones (est 2yrs old) did not do this... not sure why they would have changed the material, if that is the reason...</li>

<li> from the photo to the fit, I am not impressed at all.</li>
<li> Is the solution to a casual comfortable bra.  </li>
<li> DO NOT bother with the replacement pad with a little extra padding.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s really not.</li>
<li> This product did not fit the same as the Genie Bra</li>
<li> Disappointed because it is a VERY comfortable bra.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not looking for other alternatives for my mom.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll never buy any other bra.</li>

<li> I bought previously.</li>
<li> I am not one to wear tight bras or shirts anyways.</li>
<li> They will disintergrate after a few washes.</li>
<li> I ordered these bras because I hate underwire and sports bras are so comfortable.  </li>
<li> She&#x27;s also a 38C, I ordered an XL (per the sizing chart) and along with being a little small, it also cuts into her shoulders and leaves marks.</li>
<li> I wore it with the pads in so not sure I will wear it without but who knows.</li>
<li> remove the pads thru the small slit.  </li>
<li> They do run a tad small</li>
<li> I am not happy with the 2 sets I got as in the past</li>
<li> The removable pads don&#x27;t stay where they are suppose to and these bra&#x27;s are very hard to get on.  </li>
<li> These are fake.</li>
<li> I am sorry they are not removable with out messing up the bra itself.</li>
<li> The pads were a joke for XL - I was fooled by the picture, once bitten twice shy</li>
<li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
<li> These things are horrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered these bras because I hate underwire and sports bras are so comfortable.  These give me the best of both worlds with great support without looking smushed down.</li>
    <li> When I saw this advertised I thought hey these will be perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;The material feels good on your skin but thats about it...nothing else is true...especially support...its gives none...</li>
    <li> I agree with one of the reviews that this is nothing but another sports bra. The pads in the cups shift. The fabric is not sturdy or supportive. Don&#x27;t dislike them enough to send them back as I can sleep in them, but I will never repurchase. I only paid about 10 each so I guess I got what I paid for. But don&#x27;t waist your money on this purchase.</li>
    <li> Greatest bras ever! They are very comfortable and even work well as a cami under lower cut tops. They have survived many a washing with only a few elastics coming through which I clip off easy enough. They do run a tad small so please keep that in mind if you are a larger busted woman.</li>
    <li> I read reviews for these all over about them being true to size. I am going to have to disagree here. The size I chose should&#x27;ve been large for me but it was super tight. I went up a size and it is still snug. These are a good concept with comfortable shoulder straps BUT I don&#x27;t want something digging into my sides. I am not one to wear tight bras or shirts anyways. On a positive note, they also hold your &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; where they should be! I think they would work better for someone on the smaller side but this is my opinion. I will be hanging onto them until after I lose my baby weight to see if my assumption is actually correct. If you are going to try them out, the 3/set is not too much more than a 2/set in store.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good alternative to the ahh bra (which  I love).  These things are horrible.  There&#x27;s practically no support.  I think the manufacturer/designer got mixed up when they wanted to make a bra that feels like it is not there and made a bra that simply doesn&#x27;t do anything.  If you want a bra that provides support and gives you a feeling of freedom and movement - then stick with the ahh bra.</li>
    <li> This is a quality company theat distributes a high quality product. I&#x27;ll never buy any other bra. You step into this bra and it lifts as you bring it up. I feel well supported under the arms and back. Genie Bra give a beautiful front look as well. No strap exhaustion at the end of the day as well as no falling straps during the day. This will be my bra till I die...</li>
    <li> This is a comfy bra with moderate support.  If you are over a C cup , this is not the bra for  you.  Be sure and size up.  I wear a 36-38 C cup, and my size is L, however C cup or bigger , you size up.  Therefore l get an XL.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfy and natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;I remove the pads thru the small slit.  I found the pads move around and make a peculiar noise.  Take off the Pads.</li>
    <li> I have had these for a couple of months now and I wear them and my other genies everyday. Like another reviewer pointed out when I was reading these reviews before buying, I am pretty sure that these are not real genie bras. They are not nearly as nice or supportive as the original genies that I got from Target for 2 for $20. I decided to take a chance on these for the price of 3 for $20, but I wish I would have just gotten what I already have. There is just something off about these. They are okay for the price and I still wear them, but I just prefer my other \\&quot;real\\&quot; genie bras.      Updated on 1/4/15. These are awful. While my real genies have held up for twice as long, I am throwing these away. The only reason I give them 2 stars is because I wore them throughout my pregnancy, so I am being generous with how mis-shapen they have gotten. Again though, my other and older genies, are still going strong.</li>
    <li> These bras are super comfortable and still give you some shape.  The removable pads slip around a bit, but are fairly easy to&lt;br /&gt;reposition.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted! I have purchased these at department stores and they weren&#x27;t the same, but these are great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THEM!! Very Comfortable.  Can purchase &amp; replace pads easily.  DO NOT bother with the replacement pad with a little extra padding.  THEY WILL NOT STAY IN PLACE!!</li>
    <li> I never thought the Genie Bra would be this comfortable but OMG I love it. I received them really fast and ladies let me tell you, you will love this bra. I am a D cup and I order the XL and it fits very well. The straps don&#x27;t bother me and it does not make me feel &amp;#34;squeezed&amp;#34;.  It light weight and gives a smooth fit under your clothes. I wore it with the pads in so not sure I will wear it without but who knows. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 XL got 2 XL and 1 L.  The removable pads don&#x27;t stay where they are suppose to and these bra&#x27;s are very hard to get on.  Didn&#x27;t care for these at all.</li>
    <li> The pads in the bra want to move around and I find I am having to adjust them throughout the day!  I am not happy with the 2 sets I got as in the past (same size) I never had to adjust the pads in them the material is different with these and that seems to be the problems.  I think for now on I will buy these in the store so I can make sure I am getting the ones that the pads are not going to need adjusting all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually recommend Genie Bras to everyone as they are comfortable and I cannot seem to find the correct size in a regular bra, since losing a bunch of weight and these are my go to.</li>
    <li> BRAS WERE NICE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY CAME&lt;br /&gt;WITH CUP INSERTS, MANY OTHERS DO NOT, UNLESS&lt;br /&gt;YOU PAY FOR THEM.  WOULD ADVISE FOR WOMEN TO&lt;br /&gt;PURCHASE IF THEY HAVE HAD SHOULDER SURGERY IN THE PAST.&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO PUT ON BY STEPPING INTO AND PULLING UP, INSTEAD&lt;br /&gt;OF RAISING ARMS TO PULL OVER HEAD AND SHOULDERS.</li>
    <li> My wife has always wanted to try the genie bra. when we come across them on amazon, we decided to go for it. Thank you for you fast shipment. She said the were comfortable.</li>
    <li> a nice, lighter version of the original Genie; perfect for summer, but sorely lacking in support.  The pads were a joke for XL - I was fooled by the picture, once bitten twice shy</li>
    <li> This product did not fit the same as the Genie Bra I bought previously. The front was much lower cut which does not support me completely. Disappointed because it is a VERY comfortable bra.</li>
    <li> The quality of these bras has gone downhill.  The seams are already ripping and the inserts are cheaply made and fall out during the wash.</li>
    <li> Most comfortable bra ever!  Easy to put on and the shoulder straps don&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut-in&amp;#34;.  Very good value.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I had breast cancer surgery and the hospital recommended the Genie Bra.  Regular Bras are tighter and put pressure lines on the area where the lump was taken out.  The bras are really comfortable.</li>
    <li> love them..excellent..</li>
    <li> i returned mine immediately . you are better off getting a sports bra or something. your breast just hangs there. not what I was hoping for at all.</li>
    <li> Im satisfied with this product, and transaction</li>
    <li> These are fake. Not the same fabric as a real genie bra. Don&#x27;t provide as much support. They are more like the Ah Bra.</li>
    <li> Is the solution to a casual comfortable bra.  Washes well, fits as described, colors and values are there.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Comfortable bras! Wash well, wear well.</li>
    <li> This item is NOT as pictured! The picture gives you the impression this bra is very full coverage in the front and it&#x27;s really not. I purchased this set for my mom (she had a stroke) and she needs an easy on and off bra, but at 74 years old, she wants a full coverage bra and this just isn&#x27;t the one. It will due for now, but don&#x27;t buy this one thinking that it comes up as high on the center of the chest, as the picture shows...it does not! It&#x27;s really more of a demi-cut bra. She&#x27;s also a 38C, I ordered an XL (per the sizing chart) and along with being a little small, it also cuts into her shoulders and leaves marks. So, buyer beware...from the photo to the fit, I am not impressed at all. I&#x27;m not looking for other alternatives for my mom.</li>
    <li> ok, my mon says that this bra are simply the best on bra, because they gif a confortable and nice feeling</li>
    <li> Awful! No support and looked like a sack.  I will never get these again .  I returned them weeks sgo</li>
    <li> These are my favorite workout bras. They&#x27;re slightly padded, stay in place and are very comfortable.  An attractive tee shirt bra too!</li>
    <li> This product was in very good condition.  It came very quickly and as advertised in the photograph and caption.  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> So comfortable! I threw all of my standard bras away! These have surprisingly great support with a seemless appearance. The only downfall are the pads that fill in the cups... They are designed so you can remove them from the bra... But, if you are like me and want to wash them to keep them clean... They will disintergrate after a few washes. I have a collection of 15 of these bras, and they themself are durable and long lasting... but I am running out of the cup pads... Can I buy a box of these as replacements? If not, I will be back to regular bras...</li>
    <li> Very good deal and comfortable they are.</li>
    <li> I love the way they fit, but the pads in the pockets have a tendency to slide around and fold over in the washer  and dryer.  They did not seem to come back to their original shape. I am sorry they are not removable with out messing up the bra itself.</li>
    <li> the shoulder straps have stretched too much on these.. my original ones (est 2yrs old) did not do this... not sure why they would have changed the material, if that is the reason...</li>
