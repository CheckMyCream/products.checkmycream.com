    <li> I have platinum blonde hair and this has helped me really achieve that white blonde I wanted.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my hair. Smells good though.</li>
    <li> I died my hair bleach blonde for the summer this took all the yellow orange bras sinless right out and made my hair a gorgeous white chocolate color I wanted.</li>
    <li> This set had dramatically changed my hair!! I&#x27;ve never had such bright highlights. I&#x27;ve always wanted platinum and that&#x27;s exactly what it has given me! I just turned 30 and have a few greys popping through but with this shampoo, they turned platinum and blended with my highlights! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Always what Santa uses, great! Have been a fan for about 8 years. As long as I&#x27;m Santa, it&#x27;s Shimmer Lights for me!</li>
    <li> Gray hair does not look so dull!</li>
    <li> The BEST purple shampoo!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Smells kind of strong, but I mix it with my other shampoo/conditioner and it makes it not smell so strong.  It works perfect on my hair.</li>
    <li> It okay. .. helps with blonde I guess,  but not terrific conditioning.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner work great but you have to leave each on or several minutes in order to get the toning affect. Also, the shampoo will dry your hair out with extended use so I recommend once a week with shampoo and mix the conditioner with a deep conditioner every wash. Really works on brassiness for al shades</li>
    <li> This helps keep my platinum blonde hair bright and shiny. People always ask how I keep my blonde hair so bright and this is how. It will dry your hair so only use it once or twice a week. But even though it dries my hair I still use it because the benefits outweigh the cons. Just use some deep conditioner throughout the week and your hair will be fine.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner keeps my highlighted hair from getting to yellow, gold or red.  I like the ash blond look it gives my hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I wanted, smells funny.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> works great to help tone blonde hair!</li>

    <li> This product stinks - literally!  The odor is so strong and lasts forever!  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t read carefully and thought I was getting one shampoo and one conditioner.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t matter anyway because the stench is unbearable!</li>
    <li> Awesome got my product as expected</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair terrible feeling! Hate it!</li>
