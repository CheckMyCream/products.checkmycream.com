<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Gives my hair thickness and texture</li>
    <li> I have fine, blonde hair and this is the best mousse I have used!  It is not sticky and provides a lot of body.  It has a light, fresh smell as well.</li>
    <li> Love it!  The lift is wonderful and it leaves your hair feeling light.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for my hair type.</li>
    <li> This uplifting foam is fantastic!  I also use the Aquage Sea Salt spray, which I also love.  I only need to use a small amount on my shoulder-length hair and I can scrunch and blow dry or blow it out and it makes my hair feel thick and full of body.  I highly recommend this if you have fine, straight hair like me.</li>
    <li> Love all Aquage products.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product.  Gives my hair the lift I want, and maintains my hair color  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Awesome volume, no sticky, stiff, flakey product build-up like all other volume products I&#x27;ve tried. I won&#x27;t switch brands again now that I&#x27;ve found the best.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my fine hair</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this to work any better than cheaper drug store products on my flat hair. I&#x27;d save your money on this one...</li>
    <li> I have very long dark hair. It is soft and heavy, and frequently just needs more texture and lift. I bought this after reading rave reviews about it on a beauty blog that said it worked better than any other volumizing product.  It&#x27;s not bad. It needs to be put on when hair is a little more on the dry side to get good lift, but it does work well. It absolutely gives good texture. But for the money, you can find other products that work just as well and that are easily found in other stores and salons. I also use a Redken foam that is a few dollars cheaper and available in a lot more stores than this.</li>
    <li> I am 30, have had very fine hair all my life, and have recently noticed that on top of the very fine, super-straight, frustratingly difficult-to-style hair, it&#x27;s now thinning.  Great.  So last year I started on my quest to find products to help me stay sane when I&#x27;m trying to style my hair.  I saw this on a blog, took a leap of faith and bought it, and LOVE IT.  Seriously.  I put a lot more on my hair than I usually do with other products since too much product weighs my hair down more, but the girl on the blog said to trust her and put a lot on, so I did.  Let me state that this product is designed to give your hair TEXTURE, so yes, it&#x27;s going to feel like you have product in your hair.  Keep it at the roots.  When you have thin, fine hair, the best thing you can do for volume is to create texture.  That&#x27;s why girls tease their hair (although I can&#x27;t, because it just breaks too much) and use hairspray.  With the Aquage, I barely use any hairspray anymore at all.  It actually creates texture and volume that literally lasts all day, and I can flip my hair upside down, &amp;#34;jeuge&amp;#34; it, and it&#x27;s refreshed.  It holds style better whether I curl or straighten it.  I feel like I have someone else&#x27;s hair now.  I honestly can&#x27;t rave enough about this product.  If you have fine, thin hair, and have had a problem all your life with keeping it styled and volumized, you HAVE to buy this.  Also, check out the small things blog for instructions on how to use it.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes with blog reviews of this product, but it was just ok.  I was hoping for nice volume and feel like for the price I can achieve that with a cheaper product from any local store.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair but it gets flattened out with all of the weight. This definitely helps give my hair body at the roots.Love it!</li>
    <li> Best uplifting foam on the market</li>
    <li> I bought Aquage Uplifting Foam as I had read about it on a blog. I have somewhat thin hair and this sounded like it would be the product to fix my flat hair. After using I am a little dissappointed. I feel like it works just as well as the mousse I currently use by Tresseme and that only cost me $4.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST hair lift product I have ever tried. It definitely loved up to my expectations and the quality can&#x27;t be beat. The product is definitely worth the price! It smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> I love this product for my wavy, fine hair. It gives great lift to my roots and soft curls.</li>
    <li> love this product! gives me hair volume and gives my side bangs the right amount of texture. i have very thick hair and this product is a hair saver for me! i use this every time i style my hair!</li>
    <li> I had heard lots of good feedback on this product, but it didn&#x27;t seem to work for my hair.  It just seemed to make my hair feel dirty rather than give it any lift.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair and this product does not weigh it down, but you have to watch how and how much you apply. I do not apply directly on the roots. I spray it in my hand then work it into my roots with my fingers.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for putting lift and texture in your hair.  Highly recommend, especially for fine hair or any hair that needs lift at the roots.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very shiny and soft. It also did a terrific job with holding. My hair is thick and it smoothed it out nicely. A little goes a long way.Otherwise it coats the hair shaft resulting in a greasy residue.</li>
    <li> works great on fine hair!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, usually buy from Salon but they were out of stock. I would have had to wait a lot longer to get it from them.</li>
    <li> Came in a pink can instead....but I am assuming it is the same stuff.  I haven&#x27;t used much yet but so far so good.</li>
    <li> This magical foam gives me the hair I&#x27;ve always wanted.  I have thick curly hair that tends to get greasy and flat fast.  Not cute.  When I use this my hair has the perfect amount of volume and it holds all day. I will cry if this ever disappears from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Yippee! Finally I can say there&#x27;s a product out there that will be true to you all day. My hair is the type where it&#x27;s the boss of me, not I the boss of it. It doesn&#x27;t like to stay styled. But this Aquage Foam shows my hair who&#x27;s boss! I use this to tease my hair. I spritz a small amount on my scalp where I want to tease, rub it in a little, tease, add a little hair spray and BAM! You&#x27;re set for the DAY with a lot of volume in your hair! I&#x27;d highly recommend this product! Love it!</li>
    <li> I found this product by watching a hairstyling video on Pinterest and thought I would give it a try. Since I haven&#x27;t tried this product before I was a little hesitant to try it. But I really do love it! Works great!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Gives amazing lift without feeling crusty or caked on. Great for people like me who have thin hair which can easily look limp.</li>
    <li> I have fine silky hair and I need something in it to give it some texture and oomph. This stuff does the trick! It is awesome!! I will be using it daily for the rest of my life probably.</li>
    <li> My order was short 2 bottles!!!</li>
    <li> The product itself is great- as I have ordered it before. I was ordering this one as a gift and had a deadline to meet. The bottle was delivered damaged with a crushed top and much of the gas leaked so the foam came out as a liquid regardless of how much shaking. I just chalked it up as a loss and changed gifting directions since I was on a time restraint. Maybe when ordering from Amazon, allow yourself a while to be able to return it if it arrives damaged.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! Never knew my hair could look so full!!!</li>
    <li> So glad I tried this it gives my hair the volume it needs.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy/frizzy hair.  I used this product, sectioning off in one inch increments spraying at the scalp.  No matter how much or little product I used this didn&#x27;t improve the lift of my hair.  It left a film, again irregardless of the amount used, on the hair and scalp and this necessitated washing the hair daily - no recycling of hairstyles.</li>
    <li> This product is okay in my humble opinion.  I think there are other mousses out there that do just a good job or better than Aquage for half the price.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Would definately recommend this product it does exactly what it states. Have ordered this many times and will continue to order.</li>
    <li> Best product EVER! Love the lift for my medium length hair. Still using it after many months!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I just tried this for the first time using Kate from The Small Things blog&#x27;s video tutorial and it creates amazing volume.  If you aren&#x27;t used to having product in your hair, this definitely feels sticky at first, then later it adds definite texture to your hair.  I slept with it in and the next day I could easily revive it for an extra day&#x27;s use since I only usually shampoo every other day.  I see myself using this quite frequently in the future!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a post on a fave beauty blog. The girl&#x27;s got great hair. I have very fine, long hair and am always looking for ways to add volume and movement. This product is great and has a really handy nozzle for application. I&#x27;ve only ever used it when blowdrying with a round brush. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great product to use if you air dry. I recommend spraying this foam into your roots at areas you want volume, rub it in, flip your head over and use a blowdryer until your hair is mostly dry. Then finish off with a round brush. This product is definitely growing on me and I think would have amazing results on someone with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Best product I have found for my very fine AND thin hair.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years and keep coming back to it.  Lasts for a long time too!</li>
    <li> Bought this after watching a helpful video on youtube for styling thin hair. It works well, and it works quickly, my only complaint is it leaves my hair feeling a little rough. This could be par for the course, but as I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before, it&#x27;s new to me. Only bothers me because i tend to touch my hair a lot, and it feels different. Otherwise it does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> I heard rave reviews about this product on a blog I read, and then from some other sources, so I decided to try it.  It did not give my hair any extra volume, and it made my hair stiff and gross.  I literally wanted to wash my hair again after I was done drying and styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear a lot of products in my hair, so it&#x27;s possible that it isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;gross\\&quot; to others.  This product is definitely not for me though.</li>
    <li> This bottle arrived damaged and therefore is unusable.  I am highly unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff it adds so much volume to my hair. Easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t leave a dry crusty feeling in my hair.</li>
    <li> Always love this stuff, works great!</li>
    <li> The spray top was broken when I received it so it has been a PAIN to use.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair, this stuff is great really gives me volume!  I will buy it again , love it!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick naturally wavy hair and this stuff has no problem giving me plenty of lift and it lasts all night. I can fix my hair around 6pm, go out for dinner, drinks and dancing, and when I wake up it still looks half decent. lol. No walk of shame for me! haha</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!! I couldn&#x27;t live without it now that I know about it! It makes my baby fine hair seem like thick lush hair instantly!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s truly amazing!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product! It adds volume and texture to my fine straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist would use this on me. It gave me lift and allowed for curls to hold. My hair is stick straight and does not like holding curls. I took this product home and got a crispy mess...turns out I wasn&#x27;t using it right. I had even used less than they did in the salon. So I went back to my stylist and got instructions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can apply a lot of this, but it really needs to be worked while blow drying with a brush, otherwise you will have parts of your hair left crispy and clumped together. I use a round brush to work it in as I dry. But I dry it about 25% just using my fingers before I use my round brush. Otherwise the round brush just gets tangled with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall - great product, but must be worked in well while drying!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this product made my hair super soft but didn&#x27;t so much for the volume department. It&#x27;s better than no product but the volume it does give you falls out in a couple of hours. Big Sexy Hair Root Pump Plus is what I&#x27;ll be sticking with, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I was just introduced to Aquage products at my last visit at the hair salon. My hair was left soft and smooth. The uplifting foam works great for thin hair to give it a nice boost and volume when hair is down or styled. The foam does not feel oily on scalp or makes hair look greesy. Furthermore the hair is left soft to touch once the product has been brushed in.</li>
    <li> This product works great! It gives a lot of volume and still leaves your hair feeling soft. It does what it says.</li>
    <li> Works good! Not stiff or sticky, smells great too! I have wavy thick, heavy hair, helps give my layered bob some funk! I really like it. The hair spray ( available on Amazon ...is really good!...love it too!)</li>
    <li> Starting using this product 2 years ago and it is Great! Gives just enough lift for your roots to create great volume and does not  weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have fine hair &amp; it works so well and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product!!</li>
    <li> Nozzle was broken, falls over every time it is used.</li>
    <li> Aquage uplifting foam does not disappoint.  Instead of spraying it directly on my scalp, I have found that spraying it on my fingertips and then applying to the roots of my hair works better for me.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair volumizer I own and use. It works, smells great and doesn&#x27;t break the bank. Wish it came in a larger can :)</li>
    <li> This item was shipped so quickly by Amazon that I hope they always offer it.  I was out of product and need this to tame my fine, color treated hair.  I&#x27;ve tried many other products but this is the only one that really works and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product and all Aquage products! I have thick, unruly hair and this adds enough volume for me to curl it with a \\&quot;messy\\&quot; yet styled look. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have really thin hair and I&#x27;ve tried sooooo many products to give it volume. This is one product that actually works, smells great, and best of all... it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like dried out straw! You can&#x27;t even tell I have product in my hair. I use quite a bit of it, spray it at the roots, and the blow dry and my hair looks three times its normal size. Definitely will be keeping this in my product line up!</li>
    <li> It is a pretty good product, the pacakge is very nice and small, the product is also not very sticky and holds very well</li>
    <li> Great product! I have fine hair and it provides all day volume which is hard to come by! You will definitely feel the product in your hair, but that comes with the territory. It does not make my hair look greasy or oily, in fact, I can go an extra day without washing it when I use Aquage.</li>
    <li> I love this product for volume there is no better!!!! The tip is great for directing volume just where u want it. Price is great, in most salons it is $4 more at least. Order $35.00 worth of stuff from Amazon and shipping is free...</li>
    <li> This product had been recommended to me so I had high hopes it would give me the volume and hold I was looking for.  I watched a few tutorials on how to use the product in order to achieve max volume but when I used it on myself I didn&#x27;t even get a fraction of the volume I was hoping. I have a full head of fine just past the shoulders-length hair so maybe I just don&#x27;t have the correct hair type to be using this product with.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It gives my fine, straight hair tons of volume.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of mousse and gels to get my pin straight hair to hold a style longer but this is the one that works and works without feeling sticky or heavy~</li>
    <li> I like the volume you get with this product.  Still trying to figure out how much to use and not sure I like the texture it give your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products that claim to volumize... this is the BEST. Great if you are looking for volume for up-do&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this stuff really gives me the volume I need! I love that I can run my fingers through my hair after I have styled it and I don&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time and find that it seems to give extra body and lift for my fine, soft hair.</li>
    <li> The product itself works great, but the nozzle gets clogged every time I use.</li>
    <li> Love this hair product.  For directions on use follow Kate of thesmallthings blog.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t give my hair the lift I thought it would, but overall, a very good product.</li>
    <li> This product really gives my flat hair a ton of volume.  I will never go back to blowdrying without using this first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s supposed to be awesome...but I find that I have to use quite a bit.  I think I like it, but for $20, I expected to get more results with less product.</li>
    <li> I am using my husband&#x27;s account! I absolutely love this product. It gives me so much volume in my roots. I don&#x27;t want to ever be without this product! I will order over and over again! It might be a lil pricey but worth every single penny. I put it in my roots and then blow dry my hair upside down and I have so much volume. It doesn&#x27;t feel like build up in my hair. I can still for a few days without washing my hair if I need to. I love it sooooo much!</li>
