<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this shaving soap. It lasts a really long time, smells wonderful, and gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> highly recommended for straight razor uses, use a good quality badger brush and plenty of water for lathering up for close shave</li>
    <li> I order this product for my husband and he loves the scent, the feel, the way it lathers up and how good of a shave he get&#x27;s from it.  I would recommend this product and will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for father&#x27;s day and he loves the almond shaving soap. It has a very light fragrance and his skin is smooth and clean after he shaves with this soap. I would recommend this to anyone, even people with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> As a person new to the DE razor school of thought, i debated between this soap and the Taylor of old bond street soap. I decided on this soap because it was cheaper, and i was looking for an inexpensive soap as i had only used a cream before. It took me quite a long time to figure out the right water to soap ratio, but once i did, it gave a very nice shave. (i used to use Headblade: Headslick, which was very easy to use). Overall, i think that this gives a great shave and has a good scent, which is strong when shaving, but fades quickly. When i buy again, i will probably buy another, if for no other reason that curiosity.</li>
    <li> Col. Conk gives you a smooth shave, nice fragrance, and rich, creamy lather.  Oh yes, I almost forgot to mention the RICH, CREAMY, LATHER!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he really likes it.  I like the smell and the close shave.  He prefers something a little more &#x27;tingly&#x27; so is using a menthol-containing one now, but this is a great product.</li>
    <li> These lather well and smell good.  My husband really likes these!</li>
    <li> Shaving used to just be a drudging task every day.  I still wish there was an easier way to shave quickly, but using this shaving soap and a suitable shaving brush, made of badger hair, makes it a bit more enjoyable.  I enjoy connections with older processes...in this case, doing it the &#x27;old-fashioned&#x27; way.  Also, this method of softening up the beard doesn&#x27;t leave much to &#x27;throw away.&#x27;  It is a much greener way of doing things.  I&#x27;d prefer they sold the soap in paper packages, but I throw these plastic containers (which seem to be the actual molds for the production of the soap) in the recycle bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally like &#x27;scent free&#x27; lotions and soaps, which is why I like this...the almond is a very light scent, which is pleasant enough, but I don&#x27;t smell it more than a couple of minutes after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a shaving brush, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap seems to take a bit longer to get lather &amp; the lather is not as thick as the one other brand I&#x27;ve used, but yesterday&#x27;s shave taught me it&#x27;s not the thickness of the lather that matters, it&#x27;s the ingredients.  This soap works very well.  I deliberately allowed my facial hair to get to about 1/8th of an inch to test this soap.  There was no pulling and I used a blade that already had three shaves on it.  I&#x27;m a beginner at wet shaving &amp; still learning.  I like the fact that I could barely detect an odor because I don&#x27;t care for perfumed scents that linger after shaving.</li>
    <li> My favorite shaving soap. Lathers well, smells wonderful, lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> If you have the little extra time to whip the lather up yourself do it. This is worth it and the extra 2 minutes it takes is as well. Love Col Conk and have been using it for the past 3-4 years.</li>
    <li> If you can tolerate the Almond odor you will like the product. Good lather and the soap lasts quite long.</li>
    <li> I prefer a stiffer brush for glycerin based soaps like Col. Conk.  The badger brush can sometimes lead to frustration!  You can get a wonderful lather, though, with not too much work.  Good, close shave with nice protection for the skin.  The scents are fantastic, particularly this one (almond) and amber.</li>
    <li> Kind of hard to get enough of this soap on the brush, to get a good lather. Smells kind of funny. No problems shaving with it.</li>
    <li> As inexpensive shave soap, this does its job. When I&#x27;ve used this will go back to my old brand. Descent lather, just not a great soap.</li>
    <li> Wonderful almond scent with nice butterscotch color in minimal and effective packaging.  Three pack is nice.  Overall a great value in shaving soap.  Just drop one in your shaving mug and you&#x27;re in business.</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving with a tube of Proraso soap and liked it, but found it hard to build up a lather occassionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much easier to get a lather going with the solid soaps.  Just wet your brush and rub it on top of the soap.  This is very easy and convenient.</li>
    <li> This is not a high end boutique soap but is a very economical everyday soap for the man on a budget who perhaps wants something different than the low end Williams or good but ubiquitous Van Der Hagen you get at pharmacies and wal mart. I will say it gives a good shave and the scent is very pleasant and mellow.</li>
    <li> This soap has an addictive aroma.  Lathers up nicely and makes for a nice smooth shave. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> over many years of shaving with brush and soap, this is still my favorite brand.&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly purchase from here again.&lt;br /&gt;thx.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Works with a double edged razor and is slick enough so I don&#x27;t get cut.  The almond scent isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing. Smells great. Works up into a nice rich lather. Makes for a great shave. I went from hating to shave, to actually enjoying the process in large part due to this soap.</li>
    <li> THIS SHAVING SOAP SOFTENS BEARD FOR A NICE SHAVE. LEAVES FACEVERY CLEAN AND REFRESHED AFTER USING.  I WILL BUY ITEM AGAIN</li>
    <li> I use this with the art of shaving brush and bowl kit.  This soap doesn&#x27;t really fit into the bowl so I end up just sticking it in and having the top not fit quite right on the bowl for a week or two.  What can I say, it works and is reasonably priced.  Much cheaper than buying shaving cream from the store.</li>
    <li> Mild pleasing scent and a great lather. Excellent for pairing with an old-school safety razor for a close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Been using for 5+ years, great shave soap!</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  Good lather, nice glide.  I pop the puck into a microwave-safe container (a mug) and nuke it so it molds to the container.  This way it doesn&#x27;t move around while you&#x27;re lathering up with the brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a better shaving soap than basic drug store stuff at a fair price. This fits the bill.  Good creamy lather and pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Good lather, smell, and size</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like the Conk bars, using a different brand for a while, but I&#x27;m impressed with them.  They stick to the cup well and don&#x27;t move around once you place them, they lather quickly and it&#x27;s a thick rich lather not just a thin soap lather.  They are not harsh on my skin at all and last a long time.  Good product, I&#x27;ll be checking out more of the Col.&#x27;s stuff I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> Great scent and a great lather, I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!&lt;br /&gt;If you shave every day, get at least the three pack as it does go somewhat quickly.</li>
    <li> Makes a good lather and smells great. Slick as ....well, slick! I like using this soap and I think it&#x27;s cheaper in the long run than foams and gels. Now if only someone would come up with a &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; soap cup to make hotter lather!</li>
    <li> My husband loves these</li>
    <li> The Col Conk almond shaving soap works great.  It is not like soap, which takes a lot of rinsing.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  There is no smell after I rinse with water.  I have a pretty good sense of smell and barely notice the almond scent while shaving.  I have ordered this product twice, and will continue to do so.  I am a daily shaver and lather up twice.  Each soap cake lasts me about 4 months.</li>
    <li> inexpensive but very effective.  no fuss, no worries.  gets the job done with grace.  and the scent is perfect, not overpowering, but just enough to appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;thank you.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment good quality</li>
    <li> I may be still learning the proper way to use this item however every which way I&#x27;ve tried I am unable - so far - to get a thick creamy lather that doesn&#x27;t dry out too fast. The scent is pleasant and by the time I finish the 3 pack I may purchase again.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I have used many shaving products as I am an adventurous wet shaver currently using a Muhle safety razor with an Art of Shaving badger brush.  I tried a colonel conk variety pack a year ago and have since bought 6 more almond soaps. This stuff is is amazing.  It lathers up extremely well and smells just great. It also provides a great razor stroke as well. This will always be a staple in my shaving supply drawer. Also I usually melt my colonel conks in a pottery shave bowl I have, which reduces mess and helps in the ease of use.  You can microwave or melt in a bowl in a sauce pan, both work fine for me and it molds nicely to the bowl once cooled. The fridge for a few minutes speeds up the cooling process. Grade a soap Ol&#x27; Sport. Grade A.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Williams soap users for years since that is what was available locally at CVS. I thought I might be missing something so I picked up this soap after reading the reviews. I&#x27;m not impressed. I find it easier and quicker to get a decent lather from the Williams soap. The smell is just okay, frankly I like the Williams scent better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched some videos about using the tip of the brush to pick up some soap and then a small round bowl to build up the lather you want. I tried that and yeh it did work a little better using this method, but it took way to much effort.  I do like to take my time shaving but not that much time and would rather not sweat when shaving either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might work for you, but I&#x27;m not a fan. I suggest trying a few brands to find one you like before committing to a three pack and don&#x27;t forget to try the Williams soap - it&#x27;s an oldie but goodie in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main regret was getting a three pack.</li>
    <li> I have used all kinds of shave soap over the years but this is by far the best, smells great, lathers well, and makes for a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Col Conk suds it up and smooths it down leaving my face cut free, smooth, and waiting for the new day to dawn to start all over..</li>
    <li> I am a bit skeptical about the authenticity of this product. I have been using Col Conk Shave Soap for 20 years and have never had a batch of almond soap with a color of solid white. Normally the soap has a nice dark almond color. I haven’t used the new pucks yet, but am dreading the day my current soap runs out.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Very happy with this brand</li>
    <li> I love the scent.  Shaving with Col Conk and a brush helps keep my face looking younger. Has a good price.</li>
    <li> makes nice foam to shave.  I shave daily and a soap last a few months, good value and works great.</li>
    <li> I am new to wet shaving and thought I would try this as it had some good reviews. It seem to work very good and is reasonably priced. It works real well but I will try something new next time as I just like to try different products. This is a real nice product and lathers well. Bill S.</li>
    <li> Good soap smells good too.</li>
    <li> I purchased aCol. Conk Almond Shave Soap at a small store about 2 to 3 weeks ago.  It was one of their \\&quot;Super\\&quot; Pucks weighing in at a heafty 3.75 oz!  I bought it for just under $10, which is 2.5 to 5 times what I normally pay for a Shave Soap (I usually pay $1.99 to $4 for Shave Soap).  And I am thinking at this price, IT BETTER BE REALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Well, I tried it this morning.  And you know something, IT WAS PRETTY DAMN GREAT!  I generally use another Shave Soap which is VERY good.  But Col Conk&#x27;s Shave Soap Really is worth the price I paid for the puck.  I love the Almond smell &amp; the shave with this puck truely makes a GREAT SHAVE!!!  I will be adding this to my list of Shave Soaps to keep in stock.&lt;br /&gt;  The Almond Shave Soap was even better on the second day of using it.  I really am enjoying the Almond soap better then I thought I would.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff. Almond is one of my favorite scents for anything, and this has a nice scent that doesn&#x27;t linger too long. Besides the scent though, I&#x27;m underwhelmed by this product. It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as Proraso or some other creams/soaps I&#x27;ve used. The result is I feel like I&#x27;ve had more razor burn since I started using it. I will use the supply I have of this stuff, but probably won&#x27;t order more.</li>
    <li> This  shaving soap works up a lather like I the old compressed air shake up and spray cans. (Remember?). The Almond aroma is very mild and not overwhelming. Joe Namath would be proud to use this product. Sorry, about my senior age reference. This soap is a great value and a fine product. Thanks for the other reviews  It helped make my decision. I hope this helps you also.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father-in-law when he ran out of shaving soap.  He dislikes most \\&quot;change\\&quot; in his life, but since it was a gift he promised to try it out.  Now I have a feeling I&#x27;ll need to set up a subscription purchase, as he absolutely loves the soap.  Softens up for a great lather, smells very nice, and very economical.  Quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great Creamy Lather, Terrific Scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 seconds of pumping &amp; twisting your brush on the cake, yields a dense cream with a sweet aroma.&lt;br /&gt;As you then use your brush to massage your wet face (holding the handle, not the bristles) the cream transitions into a very smooth foam that does not dehydrate your face and rinses very well.&lt;br /&gt;The only other product I have tried that works this well is [[ASIN:B001A3DNY6 Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap]], which out performs this by a small margin, but doesn&#x27;t smell quite as nice.&lt;br /&gt;Others:&lt;br /&gt;Col. Conk Bay Rum Shaving Soap doesn&#x27;t lather quite as well (this one needs pre-shave oil to get a perfect lather), and the Amber Glycerin is worse than using a Bath Bar&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00008X5CH Williams Mug Shaving Soap]] I found to give a thin and arid foam unless I applied the bar directly to my face before lathering (as cheap as it is, you might as well try it too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary, based upon your water conditions (soft or hard), but be sure to check this one out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it goes without saying that this is head shoulders and feet above those aerosol \\&quot;shaving cremes\\&quot; which don&#x27;t last very long and don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this should be the standard that all shaving soaps and creams should at least achieve.  Nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t stay all day.  Smooth lather that doesn&#x27;t break down too much unless you use too much water.  Good cushion.  There are way better shave soaps and creams to be sure, but there are also WAY worse.  Nice sweet spot for the price.</li>
    <li> I really like the lather and what I found works best is I turn my cup upside down and run hot water on it for a minute, then run the brush under the hot water, now take the warmed up cup and later up your brush and you now have hot later it give a great shave.</li>
    <li> This soap has a nice subtle fragrance, lathers nicely and feels soothing on the face. The soaps will never compare to the creams but if you don&#x27;t want to spend more on the creams then this soap is the way to go. I went four stars just because of the difference between soap and creams, but as far as soaps this is a great deal for the money.</li>
    <li> I used Mug soap for years but decided to try something new.  This has a nice light scent and it fits in my old Avon shaving mug.  Lathers well and makes for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Great scent and a great soap for shaving. Not harsh on my skin at all. I toss one in my ceramic bowl, microwave for about 6-7 seconds and let cool in the fridge overnight to make it easier to lather up by keeping the bar from spinning in the bowl.</li>
    <li> These little soaps were packaged individually and shipped without chipping or breaking.  The almond scent was subtle while the foaming action did the trick.</li>
    <li> GREAT lather, not sloppy. You will need a shaving mug, though. You could use it in the plastic container the cake comes in, but it could get a bit messy. Scent is subtle and not lingering. Easy on the skin and moisturizing to the beard. Will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff....great smell.  Good price.  This was bought for my first time with this type of shave soap rather than shave cream.  I won&#x27;t go back to that other shelf stuff.</li>
    <li> Almonds. My fiancé wants to eat my face. This is not a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... the quality of the soap happens to be excellent, too. Works up a good lather, and makes my face feel fresh.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and it lathers up well, smells nice, and shave smoothly. I am transitioning away from the chemical goops that come in cans, and I am very happy. I bought a badger-hair brush to apply this, and I am loving it!</li>
    <li> A good assortment of soaps, with a variety of fragrances.  Arrived on time and in good condition.  I am enjoying using them every day.</li>
    <li> I have never gotten a more closer shave! Col. Conk&#x27;s Shave Soap leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed! Simply wash your face with this soap and shave! It&#x27;s that simple! One bar should last you about three months! This is an excellent product which I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I just switched from shaving cream in a can to using a brush and shaving soap. It seams to be a very good product, not an overpowering smell to the product. A puck only lasts me about 3 weeks, since this is my first jump into soaps I am going to buy several other brands and see if they give me similar results. I would give it 3.5-stars for sure, not quite 4-stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 08/19/2013&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several other shaving soaps and would use the CC&#x27;s when on vacation. However, since it doesn&#x27;t last like I would like I have moved on to other harder soaps for my needs. Others to consider would be Mitchells Wool Fat(,y current #1 soap), DH Harris/Geo F Thumpers(I think these are the same), and Edwin Jagger(requires a LOT of water). I do live in a naturally soft water area of the country Denver Colorado so my lathering results may not translate to your home!</li>
    <li> This soap makes a great lather and has a very pleasing aroma.  I especially like being able to buy three at at time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a hint for those that don&#x27;t know... about 20 seconds in the microwave will melt this soap into your bowl or mug.</li>
    <li> This seems to lather better for my husband then one of the other types of the same brand. He was not totally thrilled to be switching from shaving cream that comes in a can to this do it yourself variety, however with the better lathering of the Conk almond shaving cream, the complaints of the previous 6 months have stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Works well: will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this to prime my face before applying Jack Black shaving cream.  It smells great and when I combine it with JB shavin cream, my whiskers come off like butter.  Finish it off with some JD after shave lotion and your face is happy happy happy!</li>
    <li> Rich, creamy lather (and takes less time to work up the lather too).&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant mild aroma (was afraid it may be strong or overwhelming).&lt;br /&gt;Great smooth shave (it is quite slick, blade moves quite effortlessly).&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels softer after shave (maybe because of the vitamin E?)&lt;br /&gt;And the price is just right - what more can one want?</li>
    <li> If you want  phew phew smelly stuff, this is not it. However, it does what it is supposed to do as shaving cream. It works into a thick lather and protects your skin while shaving.</li>
    <li> Very nice aroma, lathers well and holds up even better. Very nice glide while using a razor. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff smells and it give you a great lather. It washes off clean leaving you smelling like sweet almonds.</li>
    <li> Very long lasting shaving soap.  One bar has lasted my husband for 5 months with daily shaving.</li>
    <li> Nice, light scent. Good lather. Good quality for the price. I microwave melt two pucks into the bottom of my Marvey mug.</li>
    <li> Best smelling shaving soap I&#x27;ve found to date, very nice lather! Also like the lime scent too.  The plastic travel case is cool too!</li>
    <li> worth every penny! I would recommend it to any of my friends! makes my skin feel good and it has almond!</li>
    <li> Best shaving soap on the market!</li>
    <li> Good foam.  Slight almond smell.  Overall a good product for shaving.</li>
    <li> small diameter doesn&#x27;t fit my bowl</li>
    <li> With an almost neutral scent, this soap&#x27;s biggest selling point is the smooth lather...very creamy and thick. Of course, Col. Conk is an established seller of shaving products and this one does not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers quickly and helps provide a clean, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  This soap allows me to have a clean feel prior to shaving and allows for a clean, close shave.</li>
    <li> great product lasting and smooth</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; fantastic smell. As someone new to safety razor shaving, and with extremely sensitive skin, I was very pleased. I do prefer to scrape a nice amount into my shave bowl as opposed to dabbing the brush, so a paste may be better for me - but this a quality product and pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I use it every time! The almond scent is great. I use it with Van Der Hagen Select Shave Soap. My first pass with the grain is with VDHSSS, my second pass against the grain is with this Col. Almond soap.</li>
    <li> As always delivered in a timely fashion and this is just a great product. I have been using Col. Conk soap now for a little over 5 years, very good stuff.</li>
    <li> This soap smells very nice.  I am learning how to get a good lather with it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly which is good.  After I shave and am preparing for a second pass around my mouth, I re-lather the rest of my face anyway and let it sit.  It soothes my face and makes it nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of almond, hence why I chose this brand. It is near impossible for me to get a really thick lather however. I thought it may be my brush/technique, but after trying some others out I am pretty certain it is the soap.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap gives a richer lather and a better shave than the British versions costing three times as much.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Use to use the Burt&#x27;s Bees product, but this is hard to find. This product it a little better and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Havent tried other soaps yet but this seems to do the job well. If I try others and form a different opinion I will update my rating.</li>
    <li> I love the mild scent &amp; I&#x27;m getting terrific shaves.</li>
    <li> Decent scent, medium lather.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I would like a little more lather that doesn&#x27;t dry up / disappear quickly when applied to the face.  For an introductory shaving soap I would recommend this.  If there is a &amp;#34;Sampler&amp;#34; bundle then go for that so you can see what your skin likes and what works with your shaving style.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product which provides for a smooth, comfortable shave every time. I have better value than &#x27;Casual Massive!&#x27;</li>
    <li> I can clearly feel the difference in a glycerin-based soap lather. The price of this soap is great. I&#x27;ve received compliments on its scent. Just be careful not to leave it wet as the glycerin will gel out of it.</li>
    <li> Hard to pick a favorite between the Almond and Bay Rum, So I get both. By far my favorites after trying numerous brands and scents.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap and won&#x27;t use anything else, plus it smells like heaven.</li>
