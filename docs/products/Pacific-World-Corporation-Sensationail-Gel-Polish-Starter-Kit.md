### Positive Reviews

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this item.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  I can have gel nails that look professionally done in about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting acrylics filled for years and removed them right before I used this kit. Needless to say my nails were thin and mangled from being ground for acrylics but after adding gel they look great and are sturdy. This kit was very easy to use. I&#x27;ve never had gel nails before so I have nothing to compare to but they&#x27;re very smooth and VERY shiny! I just applied it yesterday so I can&#x27;t say how durable they are but I&#x27;m still chip free. I am very happy with my investment, $50 from local walmart (but I know people look here for product reviews) I look forward to doing my own gel nails. I&#x27;ll try to remember to update in two weeks about the chipping and how hard they are to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Use THIN layers because it heats up under the light. It got very hot and I had to pull my hand out of the lamp when a layer wasn&#x27;t thin enough**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the LED lamp because I read that it&#x27;s not as damaging as regular bulbs. There are MANY many LED bulbs in the lamp. It heats up very quickly. It&#x27;s convenient that you plug the lamp in and press the button on the top to turn it on, it stays on for one minute then turns itself off. It makes a chirping sound at 30 seconds for base coat timing. It&#x27;s great not having to use a stopwatch or stare at a clock! The lamp fits four fingers. You&#x27;re supposed to do thumbs first, the fingers of one hand, then the rest.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this brand. I&#x27;m glad they include the white liquid gel polish as well as the French tip stickers. The stickers tend to chip off pretty easily, so I filled in and repainted the tips as needed. Because the stickers have the clean line, fling in with the wet polish worked fine. I had to touch up my nails every couple of days. Lasts much longer than polish and they look great.</li>
    <li> This is a good product to improve problem nails and you can save $ by doing your nails yourself.</li>
    <li> I have dry, thin, fragile nails that split, chip and tear if you look at them, yet they will not allow polish to adhere to them. Salon gel manis are the only thing that helps them not self-destruct. I bought this kit as an intro into at-home gel nails based on the price.The kit comes with everything you would need, but the bottles are small. A little goes a long way with gel, but it ran out fast. For me, the polish did not work well; it chipped after a day and peeled off after just a couple of days. It lasted longer than regular polish (I have to touch-up/pant everyday), but not what I was looking for in a gel mani. This purchase was completely worth it to me for the LED lamp - it is fantastic! Lamps are expensive, and this is a good one! It works with any LED-curable polish and is fast.&lt;br /&gt;I have since tried Gelish and OPI gel polishes, and I really like the Gelish base and top coats - I get a week-long mani,which is a big deal for me :)  I have always tended to stick to one color for a while, but now I am anxious to change my nails every week! Application is a tedious process and there is a learning curve, but it is worth it to finally have strong(er) and long(er) nails!</li>
    <li> Stays on for along time just remember you need a light to set the polish</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from my husband, and just used it for the first time yesterday. I really like how simple and easy it is to do at home; the instructions are very clear and it takes any second guessing out of how to apply it properly. My only frustration was the durability of the white tips; they break very easily, don&#x27;t stick to the nail very well, and when you are trying to file them down they chip and break no matter how gentle you are. I found that using the cuticle tool to help break off a chunk of the top and gently filing the rest down made for a big difference. It takes the same amount of time if you went to a nail salon since the tips require some time, but the end result looks like a professional did it. I am someone who is absolutely awful with giving self-polish manicures and the finances to dedicate $40-60 after tip every 2 weeks to my nails. This is an amazing product and I am very happy with the results! I would recommend buying different nail tips.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!  My nails look better than any professional manicurist has ever done.  Finally a product the exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a free bottle of white polish when I bought the kit and I use the white polish everytime.  I don&#x27;t use the white stickers as I found they peel off and separate after a few days even under 2 coats of gel polish.  So, make sure you get the white polish if you want a long lasting french manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails look AMAZING for at least two weeks, no chipping or flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can take you a couple of times to get the right &amp;#34;touch&amp;#34; to get the white tips just right, but be patient, you can do it and you&#x27;ll be amazed with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking them off can be a pain in the bum, but the results are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensationail is definitely sensational!</li>
    <li> French tips stink. I only got the kit to get the lamp, primer, and clear coat again.</li>
    <li> I have used my sisters starter kit and decided to buy my own, I am so glad I did.  I was concerned buying the French Manicure version because of the reviews, but I think with a little patience and some practice you really can get a quality manicure. I did my French manicure today for the first time and found the tips to be quiet easy to work with once I got the hang of it.  I was able to even pull one off that was slightly uncentered and reapply it perfectly.  This is really a great system.  I cant wait to buy more colors but the french is really a beauty! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Overall I love this gel kit, super easy to use, and fantastic price! What I don&#x27;t like is the white of the French manicure. It&#x27;s a sticker type thing that you apply after a coat of gel polish (the you apply the gel top coat) and even with the top coat it started chipping within a day. If you&#x27;re looking for a gel system I recommend this brand, but I&#x27;m not loving the French mani part.</li>
    <li> Best product for the price I am completely satisfied- bye-bye nail salons!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery great product</li>
    <li> Not too bad.  I recommend using the paint rather than the stickers. It came off after a few day though.</li>
    <li> Been using this since Christmas. It is saving me paying for my own shellac. I even have started doing the manicures of two of my coworkers for a little extra $ :)</li>
    <li> So easy to do! I&#x27;m so glad I bought this kit, saves ton of $ . Looks like I got my nails done at the salon. I didn&#x27;t use the white tips l, found them very hard to use. Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, definitely worth the money I paid.</li>
    <li> The gel polish kit was great, however, the white strips were very hard to get off the paper and tore and split very easy.</li>
    <li> I love sensationail gel polish. I bought a kit for my daughters in the wine color and decided to get one for myself. The only reason I gave this kit four stars is the white tips that come with the French are very brittle and don&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> Looks nice but at the second day start peeling..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say about the product. Yes it does what it says, it does last 2 weeks but its hard to do. It&#x27;s not as easy as it looks.</li>
    <li> I really like this gel polish kit. The french tip stickers are a little tough to put on but after a few attempts I&#x27;ve gotten better at applying them.</li>
    <li> You only get little tiny bottles of polish. The polish is clumpy and sticky and doesn&#x27;t go on well. The UV light isn&#x27;t very effective at drying / curing the polish - yes I followed the instructions. My nails are still sticky. I washed my hands and they are all completely gummy again. It&#x27;s all going to have to come back off and I&#x27;m returning the kit. I&#x27;ll go to a beauty supply store and buy the real stuff.</li>
    <li> This product was great!  It arrived in a very timely manner dispite the holiday rush, was in perfect condition and was a high light for the giver and receiver of this gift.  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Cathy</li>
    <li> I like how quickly the polish sets with the LED light. It&#x27;s amazingly fast. But the polish does not last more than 5 days. I wasn&#x27;t even putting my hands in water too much, but it would peel off.  It also ruins the natural nail underneath, so growing out the nails has been a pain. But the color and the speed makes it worth it.</li>
    <li> With in the first 24 hours some of the white tips already started to chip. At first I was gonna return it but I decided purchase a separate bottle of white gel polish and try again. So far it has lasted for a week and for me that&#x27;s and even after I have done things like yard work, house work, etc and my nails still look great. I recommend that if you want to try gel nails go to youtube to learn some helpful tips. If you have time and patients then it&#x27;s worth it especially when it helps save money from going to the nail salon.</li>
    <li> This lasted two weeks for me.  I need guidance to apply the white polish to my nail tips so I purchased circular stickies--the kind you find at the stationery store.  Also nail polish removal was difficult so I went to Sally Beauty and bought one of their gel nail polish remover products.</li>
    <li> I applied the polish and followed the instructions exactly as listed in the leaflet. I took my time as this was my first time applying gel nails on myself. Whole process of doing both hands took an hour. The LED lamp worked fine. I painted the tips instead of using the stickers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review in about two weeks as the manicure was done about two days ago.</li>
    <li> Finally I have beautiful nails for more than a week: The instructions are easy to follow. It takes about have an hour altogether. As the nailpolish bonds only under the light you can take your time to put it on! I never use Acetone to take them off. After let&#x27;s say doing dishes in hot water or soaking them in it - they easily peel off after they had been on for maybe a week or even more. And there&#x27;s a special tool you can buy that helps peeling them off. And I do not buff the nails as they are already rough enough after having peeled off the old ones. Usually I take a one day break where I pamper the nails with oils and cream before putting on the new layer. For me it&#x27;s just the best - worth every penny :-)!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several months now.  The light is fine, though I&#x27;m considering the Royal light so that I can do both hands at once to save time.  (But it certainly won&#x27;t save storage space - this is nice and small but you do four fingers on one hand, then both thumbs and then the other fingers - so the time spent curing adds up.)  I used the french tips only once as I found them to be time-consuming to apply (but they looked terrific at first!) and not long-lived.  A couple of them chipped after a few days, which I found very disappointing.  This, of course, could be because it was my first try with the system.  I just used regular white polish to fill the chips and then went over it with some Posh topcoat and it actually lasted quite a while.  I bought other colors and have had AMAZING success - LOVE the gel manicure system, which I purchased because I have a small child and that means I cannot spend time every couple of days doing manicures and I cannot stand chipped nails.  Probably the best part for me is that I can USE my nails - I&#x27;d highly recommend a gel system for people who wear gloves a lot (i.e  polish doesn&#x27;t last!) or people who want/need to use their nails and don&#x27;t want to worry constantly about chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read that you could try regular polish between the gel base and top coats as long as you&#x27;re sure to let that thoroughly dry - I tried a french with a white Revlon and it only lasted about a week and that included a couple of touch-ups (quick and easy but still not the point of a gel manicure).  As mentioned, I&#x27;ve been incredibly happy with the color polishes - I&#x27;ve tried Sunset Coral and Pink Chiffon as well as a couple of Red Carpet brand colors (use those with the Red Carpet base/top system - maybe it was just one unlucky manicure but when I mixed the Sensationail base/top with the Red Carpet color it chipped after a couple of days).  Regardless, you can use the light with any brands you like.  I&#x27;m still very happy withthe colors and really, really find this to be worthwhile - honestly, it&#x27;s totally worthwhile if you are going on vacation and just want to do a manicure/pedicure with this to ENSURE that your nails will look AMAZING the whole vacation!  Way better than dragging along extra polish or worrying about using your nails carefully so they don&#x27;t chip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I&#x27;ll try a white gel polish to see if I can get a longer-lasting French.  I guess I&#x27;d recommend that others buy in one of the offered colors as I&#x27;m not sold on the french tips provided.  As mentioned, mine chipped after a couple of days but, in fairness, it was my very first gel manicure and I&#x27;d never used French \\&quot;stickers\\&quot; before.  (For a tip that even works with gel polish, see Misha&#x27;s video on the tube about doing a french using a eyeshadow brush to make the perfect \\&quot;smile\\&quot; line - it was a miracle for me!  I even signed up for an account so I could comment on how great this was!  And since gels don&#x27;t soak off immediately with acetone, you can use this trick on a gel french. (I know what you&#x27;re thinking - acetone will take off a gel manicure eventually but where mine chipped was at the ends, nowhere near where the acetone and eyeshadow brush are when defining the smile!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also reviewed a couple of different removal systems - the KEY for me is twist ties - twist those babies down over the nail to keep the acetone in contact with the gel and it comes off SO MUCH FASTER!  (Just tonight I compared the OPI foil wraps to the Orly pouches and they gave the same (quick) result as long as a twist tie was holding them tight against the polish.  Added bonus to the system - you can actually do things while soaking off the polish!</li>
    <li> I love Sensational but the French Tips are very hard to apply. The crack easily and it is very hard to get a clean break once they are on. I love using the solid colors and love how long they last. However the french tips are no good!! I think strip guides with white would work much better!!</li>
    <li> This kit is very nice overall.  Your nails come out very shiny and look like acrylics for the first few days! The process does take some practice, however.  The french tips can be really brittle and hard to work with, but once you get the hang of it,  they&#x27;re great. My polish usually lasts 6-9 days before it chips or loses shine. I&#x27;m very pleased overall.</li>
    <li> Removal even with 100% acetone is difficult and long. I&#x27;m worried that my nails might be getting damaged</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Great little starter kit, but because it is a &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; be aware that the bottles are very, very small.  You will need larger sizes in all of the products very soon; so you may want to order those at the same time.</li>
    <li> This was sad. I really was excited to get this product and had been looking so forward to using it. The UV light is fine and all the polish was fine but the little white strips are horrible. They all cracked when I went to put them on the nail so I had to keep trying to use one that wasn&#x27;t cracked so I ended up going through a few packages of them. Before I could take the white strip for the French Manicure off the plastic sheet it would crack into tiny pieces. I tried everything but still they would crack and end up a mess. I went through several packages and still they were cracked and looked bad.I can&#x27;t believe they can&#x27;t get a silk wrap or another matieral that would not crack. The very next day after applying them they started to crack under the polish and fell off.&lt;br /&gt;So I am very disappointed in this, I was really hoping it was wonderful.</li>
    <li> Works great and I think it looks better than what my nails look like after going to a nail salon.  Great value for what you get.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the bonus white gel polish in my kit, so that kind of sucks because I was looking forward to not having to use the strips. Everything else was in my kit and the lamp works great. Great value!</li>
    <li> Lots of work with this products, -time consuming, poor results. The white tips are difficult to stick to the nail among other things. I ended up throwing this product in the garbage. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit, easy to use and cheaper than at local stores!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this kit! The instructions are very clear, and the manicure lasts me between 7 - 10 days.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit from CVS along with the 9.99 bottle of Sensationail gel strengthener. I wanted a very subtle look that would appear natural and also provide a nice smooth, strong base for frequent color changes. I haven&#x27;t used the white tips yet because my nails are very short.&lt;br /&gt;~I started by buffing out all the shine on my nails and I mean ALL of it. If you have any shine left around the cuticles the gel WILL lift. I&#x27;m using the gel cleanser for now to wipe away dust as well as the tacky layer left behind after the polish cures, but as soon as the tiny bottle is gone I&#x27;ll be switching to alchohol prep pads which are super cheap and do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;~Next step is the primer, apply super sparingly and don&#x27;t get any on your skin or it will burn when you cure under the light. Let it dry for a minute so it starts to look chalky.&lt;br /&gt;~In the kit the next step would be a thin layer of base/top coat but since I spent the extra money on the strengthener I&#x27;m using that in place of a base coat. It&#x27;s very similar just a bit thicker to add some more \\&quot;weight\\&quot; to my nails and make them less prone to bending and cracking the polish. Cure for 30 seconds. *On a side note this lamp is excellent! Plenty of room to fit 4 fingers in there and it beeps after 30 seconds so I don&#x27;t have to count. Much better than the Sally Hansen LED which is comparable in price but not quality.*&lt;br /&gt;~Since I&#x27;m using this gel as more of a nail strengthener than a final polish, I only put one layer of the sheer pink instead of two. It&#x27;s such a tiny bottle I didn&#x27;t want to waste it. Same deal be careful not to get it on your skin and swipe around the cuticles with the orange stick to get it off because it will lift and crack if you&#x27;re not careful. Cured for 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;~Now a thin layer of the base/top coat, another 60 seconds and wipe with the gel cleanser (or alcohol prep pads!) And boom! You&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is very natural, slight pink and super shiny! I love to change colors often but always have so much trouble with my dry brittle nails. With this subtle pink, super smooth base I simply paint whatever regular polish I choose without a base coat. When it&#x27;s time to change I just clean with non-acetone polish and paint again. The gel layer stays intact underneath. When my nails get longer I&#x27;ll test out the white tips and 2 coats of pink.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I really like this little kit.  Mine came with both the stickered tips and the white polish.  I&#x27;ve tried both applications, so my review is based on both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for use is very clear and easy to understand, so much so that after regular use I believe I should be able to do my nails without having to consult the user&#x27;s guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sticker tips is the only reason I&#x27;m not giving a 5-star review.  The removal from the pack wasn&#x27;t as difficult as I&#x27;d imagined (based on other reviews), but it did curl up after removal, so application took longer than I would have liked.  I also realised, very belatedly, that the key to getting a better smile line would have been to start from the middle of the nail, and then work out towards the sides of the nail.  When I started from one edge to go to the other, my smile line ended up being almost in the middle of my fingernail and just didn&#x27;t look right.  However, once on and the manicure completed, the white certainly pops and looks uniformed.  Unfortunately, my joy was short-lived.  My hands are always in water, and so from the very next day the whites started lifting, and before even a week had passed, all my nail tips were chipped and looking terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white polish gives a longer lasting manicure.  I was able to last a full week before the signs of a chip was visible and by the end of 2 weeks, only half of my nails are chipped.  I need more practice perfecting the smile lines, but it wasn&#x27;t difficult at the first attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finished product gives an incredible glossy shine that looks just as fresh 2-weeks later.  Other than the tips, I experienced no other lifting or peeling.  The curing time adds maybe an extra 10-15 minutes to a standard manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The removal process was a lot easier and a lot less time consuming than I imagined, even though I totally forgot to buff off the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m glad I bought myself this.  I can do my manicures at my leisure at a way more affordable price!</li>
    <li> The item I purchased was used! Nail uv light should not be used item. That is very unsanitary. The inside was sticky and gross</li>
    <li> The product is great. It comes with everything you need and is really easy to follow. It comes with detailed instructions and a &amp;#34;cheat&amp;#34; sheet for when you get used to it. The clear/pink gel that you put on works really well. In fact, it still hasn&#x27;t come off my nails. I deduced one star because it is difficult to get off. You need pure acetone to soak your nails in (and put a bowl of hot water around that). Another star was deducted because I was pretty disappointed in the white tips. It&#x27;s difficult to do on your own and they chip really easily. I may have needed to put a thicker over coat on and let it cure for longer... It may have been my fault because I have only used it one time. In my opinion, if you just used the pink color or find another solid color you like (and make sure you have pure acetone to remove it when you&#x27;re ready), it would be fantastic!</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictures. Excellent product</li>
    <li> Like it but it didn&#x27;t stay on the full 2 weeks like it stated. peed off right away.</li>
    <li> I have experience with gel nail products, however, this was the first time I have ever done my own French manicure. Everything you need comes in the box, so, its a great buy. The only difficulty I had was with the French tips. they tend to chip during the application process. Perhaps that was due to my inexperience. However, I love the product, and would purchase again..</li>
    <li> The seller was excellent, but the product is not easy to work with! The white tips are a pain in the butt to deal with and they peel off easily even after the polish is cured.</li>
    <li> shipping was on time the only thing I&#x27;m a little upset is that I paid separate shipping and handling for two different things but they both came in the same box other than that the led lamp works fine but the white tape tips comes off in (A) days n it looks nothing like the box the pink is not that pink the white is basically clear coat :-/ don&#x27;t matter how many white coats I put on comes out looking bad nI know what I&#x27;m doing...</li>
    <li> I have to say this is so difficult to use. I am so frustrated using it, I would rather just go pay for the manicure to look good. The tips are ridiculous. They break so easily, they don&#x27;t correctly adhere to the nail the majority of the time, and the lam is not very powerful. I have tried using other nail polishes besides just the french and I will tell you it DOES NOT dry. I will put my nails into this lamp repeatedly for up to five minutes time and it is still tacky. For a gel manicure lamp that is unacceptable. I used this product, or tried to, twice. The first time I managed to finagle the tips onto my nails with a mediocre at best looking manicure, and it chipped off within four days. Overall terrible experience with this product and I am very disappointed because I hate spending a fortune at the salon, but obviously the investment is worth it. Not pleased at all.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Love having beautiful nails without the huge salon costs. The range of varnish colours are very differ cult to choose from I&#x27;d like the all :0)</li>
    <li> They give you very little product for how much it is wroth. The white strips used for the french manicure ripped and teared very easily and starts to get frustrating after a while. If i had the chance to rewind back in time I would have not bought it. As far as the nail colors and polish goes the gel seems to hold up very well. My only problem was the manicure strips and the small amount of nail polish that was given.</li>
    <li> I will NEVER go back to regular polish after using gel/shellac polish!  LED LIGHT is the WAY TO GO.  UV lights are like putting your hand in a mini-tanning bed and just makes you more susceptible to skin cancer after using this thing all the time.  Plus the LED light takes half the time to cure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is SO quick and easy and lasts so much longer than regular polish.  If you don&#x27;t like it at first, try, try again.  Follow the steps in the directions and you should be fine.  I haven&#x27;t gotten a hang of the stick on french manicure tips - I usually just paint my french tips but I will try them again and see how they turn out and update this review if I succeed with them. But this is what I do when I use a regular gel polish color:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Push back &amp; cut cuticles&lt;br /&gt;2. File/shape nails&lt;br /&gt;3. File/rough up the TOP of the nails - no need for a dremel, you don&#x27;t need to get them as rough as you would if you were getting acrylics put on but you should rough up the nail base to help the polish stick on better and stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;4. Wash hands&lt;br /&gt;5. Wipe nails with 91% isopropyl alcohol using PAPER TOWEL (don&#x27;t use a cotton ball or any stray fuzzies from the cotton ball will make the polish look bad).  OR use pH Bond OR use the Primer gel.  If you use all the Primer gel this kit comes with, 91% isopropyl alcohol will work.  Allow alcohol, pH bond or primer gel to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;6. Paint a base coat (sometimes called &amp;#34;Foundation gel&amp;#34;) - Cure for 30 sec in LED light&lt;br /&gt;7. Paint 1 coat color polish - Cure for 30 sec (1 min for darker colors).  Make sure this coat is somewhat thin - if it is too thick then it will not cure all the way through and it will WRINKLE.  If your polish looks wrinkled on any finger after curing it then you will most likely have to redo that last layer, and it will likely peel off easily where it is wrinkled because it is still liquidy under the outermost layer that is semi-cured.&lt;br /&gt;8. Repeat step 7 until you achieve the desired color of layers of polish - usually 2-3 thin layers works best.  May only need 2 for darker colors.&lt;br /&gt;9. Paint 1 coat of top coat polish - cure for 30 sec.&lt;br /&gt;10. WIPE tacky layer off nails with your rubbing alcohol (or gel cleanser from this kit) and paper towel and you&#x27;re finished! When you run out of gel cleanser from this kit just use rubbing alcohol - it works just as well and is cheaper than buying more &amp;#34;gel cleanser&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;- AVOID putting the polish on all the way up to your cuticle base.  If you avoid having the polish up against the cuticle then it will grow out nicer and not have a hard ridge.&lt;br /&gt;- This is not like regular polish in that your mistakes (polish that gets on your skin around your nails) will wash off with a little nail polish remover or after washing your hands a couple times.  This gel cures in the light and &amp;#34;hardens&amp;#34; while curing, so the polish will cure how it lays, where it lays including any buildup on the sides of the nails or at the cuticle etc.&lt;br /&gt;- Before soaking the gel polish off in acetone FILE the top layer off the nails and you will save a lot of time.  Also&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s hard not to love this stuff.  I bought a kit for my friend and another for my mom after purchasing one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;__________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: HBA DEPOT&lt;br /&gt;Price: $34.98&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 3 days after order datethe desired color of layers of polish - usually 2-3 thin layers works best.

    <li> I am a nurse, and regular polish only lasts a day or so.  This lasts at least a week for me.  Once or twice a nail has come loose early, but I can apply more top coat and put it under the light for 30 seconds.  Problem solved.  I&#x27;d give it five stars because its a great home use product, but removing the polish is so horrible.  I got the removal tool which helps, but it still takes a long time and can be hard on your own nails if you&#x27;re not very careful.</li>
    <li> I did gel nails many years back that where a heck of alot more work, time and mess.  This was easy, quick and the results are outstanding.  First time out the French Manicure turned out better than my last trip to a salon.  I did use the stickers so I&#x27;ll have to see how long the white tips last, but I had no trouble with putting them on and was careful to top coat gel on the heavier side to level it to the nail.  I am so happy to see my winter dry breaking nails looking so nice.  So glad I went for it.  Excited to try some of the great colors I also bought when I got my starter kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The French Manicure lasted a week before the white tips started to look pretty worn,  but in fairness what I did with my hands this last week it really is a miracle it lasted that long.  I would prefer gel white for the tips as it would have lasted longer than the strips without a doubt.  I am still very pleased with the kit though.  This manicure I roughed up the surface of the gel with a file, clipped off any loose gel (there was very little) and started with the base gel as a fill, then my color Tangerine Glitter (2 coats), georgeous color bye the way, then the top coat.  Again I got a professional looking manicure, in the privacy and comfort of my home when I felt like doing it.  Still love the look of French Manicure and will look to find white gel for tips as was mentioned by another reviewer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product. I would have given 5 stars but the French manicure white tips are terrible. They were too big and stuck to everything but the nail I was trying to apply them to. The actual gel and polish were easy to apply. I look forward to getting more colors!</li>
    <li> I love the kit... A lot of people I talked to said it didn&#x27;t really work very well but I had perfect results on my first try, the only problem I had was the white strips, I tried them on my sister and they didn&#x27;t work but it comes with a white polish and a pink which are both pretty alone</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s alright. looks nice at first but hard to get off.</li>
    <li> I had been getting \\&quot;Shellac\\&quot; manicures at salons and was excited to try the Sensationail home system. I think most stores stock the Red and Raspberry ones normally but I prefer a more subtle look so I went with this French Manicure one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UV gel is  best described as halfway between a nail polish and a gel nail. It is much stronger than nail polish but more flexible than gel nails. Included in the kit is everything you need for at least 10 applications:&lt;br /&gt;-LED Lamp with electric cord, big enough to put 4 fingers in at a time&lt;br /&gt;-double sided nail buffer, manicure stick&lt;br /&gt;-100 white tips (more on this later)&lt;br /&gt;-small package of lint free wipes&lt;br /&gt;The actual product: gel cleanser, primer, color gel polish (\\&quot;babydoll pink,\\&quot; which is a mostly opaque pale pink), gel base/top coat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the steps to the Sensationail system:&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean and shape your nails&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply primer&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply gel base, cure under lamp 30 secs&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply color, cure under lamp 1 minute&lt;br /&gt;5. Apply top coat, cure under lamp 1 minute&lt;br /&gt;4. Wipe with cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this kit is a great value and includes easy to follow instructions. However there are a few cons...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The biggest thing you need is really steady control when putting this stuff on. Unlike regular polish, if you get some on your skin outside the nail it just doesnt look good and will start to lift around the egdes. Your left nails may not be as perfect when you are right handed for example. If this is already a problem for you with regular polish, this may not the best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  This stuff is difficult to remove as it does bond strongly to your nails. The kit does not include pure acetone which you need to soak in to get rid of the gel cap. You can use regular nail polish remover as well but it will take much longer.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I recommend filing the top of the nail with a rough file to help break the seal prior to using acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.This brand has very limited color choices. However, you can use this lamp to cure other UV gel polishes if you want more options. You may even do some fancy patterns if you get stamping tools or stickers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Not a dealbreaker, but the white nail tips that come with the French kit fall flat. They are thick white brittle stickers that are hard to apply and dont look good in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gel manicures are the best so if you do decide to buy this have fun with it!</li>
    <li> These tips are absolutely awful to try and apply.  Tips are brittle and very sheer and they crack and break BEFORE you even get them applied.  Once they are on and covered according to the instructions they still chip off almost immediately.  I love the color gels, they stay beautiful for weeks but forget the french tips, they aren&#x27;t worth the time or the money.  I was VERY disappointed in this as I really love the french  manicure look and this just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> I would not waste your money on this and go with the CND Shellac product which won&#x27;t damage your nails.</li>
    <li> I love gel nails. This makes it so easy to do it yourself. If you can paint your nails you can give yourself gel nails!</li>
    <li> First let me say this review is strictly for the French tips.  The rest of their nail polish and line of gel products are on point.  These are awful.  I am a seasoned gel polish user.  I do them at home now but used to get them done in the salon. I have come to master it flawlessly so I figured these would be a breeze!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO! They are easy to position and put on your nail where you want it they are AWFUL at filing and cleaning up the excess.  I suffered through the madness with the s***ty application did my best and they still cracked and chipped before I could top coat and cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been wearing them for 3 days with terrible ugly trashy chipped French tips. Simple they don&#x27;t work.  Mind I am a mother,  I work full time as an educator,  I use my hands a lot and the solid gel polish holds up perfectly for 9 or so days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottom line is it doesn&#x27;t work.  The whole point of doing gel at home is so they look  like you went to a salon.  These tips did not provide results to my standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it a 2 cause it&#x27;s a great idea and I do love the OTHER sensational products.</li>
    <li> This is SO easy to use and it looks OUTSTANDING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated to try gel nails on myself because I&#x27;d read a lot of reviews in which people stated that it easily pools into the cuticles, which made me think that gel polish was somehow thinner and less easy to control than regular polish.  NOT SO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish is far easier to use than regular polish because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1- It is the same viscosity as regular polish and is just as easy to keep out of the cuticles&lt;br /&gt;  2- It doesn&#x27;t dry, so you can take your time applying it and create a perfect gap&lt;br /&gt;  3- It is unbelievably self-leveling, so even the sheer pink in this kit goes on 100% streak-free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all that is in addition to the uber-shiny gloss and near indestructibility of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so gel takes a while to remove, but you save that amount of time - and then some - by not having to wait for your nails to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love it because if I decide I want to wear a regular nail polish over my gel, the gel makes my nails much stronger and therefor keeps my regular polish chip-free for much longer.  And if I want to change the color, I just remove it with regular nail polish remover and pop on a new color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the LED light in this kit, too.  Nice to know I will never have to worry about replacing lightbulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the box this kit comes in.  It&#x27;s easy to put everything back in the box for storage.</li>
    <li> Really does work. Small hint. Make sure to get the coats THIN and stay away from the nails edge and cuticles. Pooling looks sloppy when cured.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. The white tops started chipping off within 2 days. And the process to completely remove the gel was a real pain. Way too time consuming for your nails to only look nice for 2 days.</li>
    <li> bought as a gift, l think it will be exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> I love this gel kit.  I&#x27;m an artist and am used to zero luck keeping a manicure intact.  This looks lovely and stays fresh looking on my overworked hands.  I get 10-14 days out of it, before I have to redo! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The polish lasts for week. It takes awhile to remove the old polish.</li>
    <li> I already had the starter kit, with another color, it works great, and is an inexpensive way to get a gel lamp and the basics. I have tried SO many french manicure kits. I can&#x27;t paint white tips freehand, and guides are messy. I tried the kiss gel dress kit. It was only so-so. I didn&#x27;t like that those tips had to be glued on with nail glue. This kit is amazing! I refills for the white tips can be found on the cheap. Thats what makes this kit! The pink is very sheer...if you&#x27;re blessed with naturally pink nailbeds, you likely won&#x27;t even need it. I used the sensationail base coat, because it&#x27;s what I had, but to be fair in this review, I use Red Carpet Manicure Brilliance top coat or OPI gel when I really want it to last, because I find it DOES last longer than others. I don&#x27;t think the Sensationail top coat lasts as long. I use Kiss Top Up gel when I don&#x27;t want something to last 10-14 days, it removes easier.</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect! Very fast shipping! Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> Not great gel polish. I prefer OPI and Essie</li>
