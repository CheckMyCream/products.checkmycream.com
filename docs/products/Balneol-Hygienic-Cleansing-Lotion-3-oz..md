      <li>It is a bit costly, but worth every penny to me as I can function as a somewhat &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Far superior to generic version.</li>
      <li>I really feel I need some sort of compensation for losing some of the lotion because it is not inexpensive!</li>

      <li>It is truly amazing and definitely has worked miracles for me and my life during the past 10 years.  </li>
      <li>AND they had it to me with FREE shipping in less than 24 hours!  </li>
      <li>Helps you get/feel really clean without harsh rubbing.</li>
      <li>Everyone should use this product for their personal hygiene, just put a dab on one section of toilet paper folded in fourths and clean yourself after every BM and a dab on your fingertip for those who suffer with Vulvodenia and you will find instant relief!  </li>

    <li> Been using this product for years . . . its fabulous, and this seller offers it at a good price.</li>
    <li> This lotion saved my sanity when going through anal cancer, which caused engorged external hemorrhoids, and later, the&lt;br /&gt;effects of daily radiation.&lt;br /&gt;I wish every oncologist knew about this -- no MD or RN I spoke with had heard of it.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the availability of a three-pack, which reduced the cost, as it&#x27;s a pricey product ... and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great ! Smells good too!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever gotten a horrible itchy rash on your bum from Methylisothiazolinone (an antibiotic/preservative found in wipes and and other products) and can&#x27;t use your beloved Cottonelle Fresh Care Flushable wipes to stay clean and fresh anymore, then Balneol is your new best friend!!! Been using it for over a year now and I use it daily.  Just started buying it on amazon (much cheaper than from the pharmacy). Pricy, but worth it!</li>
    <li> Better than expected.</li>
    <li> My husband was using wipes (a different brand) and his skin blistered and bled.  I looked up the wipes online and saw that this was a common occurrence and several reviews mentioned Balneol so we purchased it and it has worked perfectly.  The rash cleared up and he loves this product.  It is easy to carry with us when we travel.</li>
    <li> I started using this product while pregnant it keeps you clean and fits perfect in your bag</li>
    <li> With everyday use (I put it on with a baby wipe) has helped  greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great preventative too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used along with Tronolane (when needed) closest thing to a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; for hemorrhoids I have found</li>
    <li> bottles were filled to the top, and were the same product I buy locally.  Plus I expect it to last a long time.</li>
    <li> If you have issues with itching or hemorroids, this product is really good.  Helps you get/feel really clean without harsh rubbing.</li>
    <li> Great I have been using for years.  It soothes and heals at the same time.  I would recommend to anyone needing a strong lotion to cleanse and health.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff, period. Instantly soothes raw areas. It&#x27;s great for extra cleaning too. I have tried everything over the years and there is no comparison.</li>
    <li> Balneol is a fantastic cleansing lotion.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied! Great service!!</li>
    <li> I actually really like this product very well.  I have used it in the past.  When I received the three bottles shrink wrapped together, one had leaked quit a bit of its contents out.  I had to clean up the mess, plus I lost that much of the lotion.  I think the shrink wrap was too tight.  I would like to see it shipped in a better way.  I really feel I need some sort of compensation for losing some of the lotion because it is not inexpensive!</li>
    <li> I must share my LOVE of this product!  I not only have IBS that causes inflammation of my hemorrhoids, but unfortunately I also suffer from Vulvodenia, not a disease anyone would want to deal with!  For years I tried everything imaginable to find some relief, nothing worked, and I mean nothing.  Until my gynecologist who&#x27;d been helping me for years had a patient that told her about this product.  It is truly amazing and definitely has worked miracles for me and my life during the past 10 years.  It is a bit costly, but worth every penny to me as I can function as a somewhat &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; person.  Everyone should use this product for their personal hygiene, just put a dab on one section of toilet paper folded in fourths and clean yourself after every BM and a dab on your fingertip for those who suffer with Vulvodenia and you will find instant relief!  Better yet, Retail OTC has it for $5 less a bottle than what I can purchase it for at the pharmacy AND they had it to me with FREE shipping in less than 24 hours!  You won&#x27;t be sorry, give it a try!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works great.Relieves rectal irritation and makes cleanup easier . Far superior to generic version.Great price also. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever!!!</li>
    <li> fast delivery , no problems.</li>
