<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it.  Works well especially in those intimate areas.  You should take your time and not be in a hurry shaving in those areas anyway.I have used it a couple of times already and haven&#x27;t had any nicks yet.</li>
    <li> I dropped my first one and it broke. I loved it so much that I had to buy another one. Very close trim.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! It&#x27;s small and it gets right in to the areas that you need. The former reviews were spot on.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve used it for  the  first  time  today and it does exactly what it says.  The shipping time was great with this item and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have used the shaver only once so far but I was very happy with the results.  I bought the shaver for &amp;#34;personal grooming&amp;#34;.  I used a tiny bit of baby powder on my skin and got to business.  The shaver is easy to use and I did get a very clean cut.  There was no pulling or tugging and definitely no nicks or cuts.  I then decided to use it on my arms.  It removed the hair on my forearms perfectly as well.  So far I am extremely happy I got this shaver.  This is the first personal shaver I have used.  I would definitely recommend.  I rated it a 4 out of 5 because I&#x27;d like a rechargeable option.  Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> I really like this thing. I use it on my lady bits, and it does a great job. I want to get something to buff the remaining hair away, but this gets the hair pretty short - leaves things looking and feeling pretty good. A word of advice - if you find it keeps pulling at your hairs, which can be very mildly painful, try switching up the angle. I hold it at a 45 degree angle or higher, no pulling then. Great product!</li>
    <li> Handles like a blade razor. Shaves closer when pulled slowly against the grain. Best if area is trimmed low first. Blades will pull and pick at tougher hairs a bit when the shaver is new but smooths out after some use and the blades aren&#x27;t brand new.</li>
    <li> works well and the T shape is key.  keep the batteries fresh and clean the blade fairly regularly and you are good to go.  Not recommended that you drop on a tile floor - not super rugged.</li>
    <li> Within the first 10 seconds of use, it was already tugging and pulling at my hair! I&#x27;ve been taking care of my intimate area for years and this is the first time a trimmer has actually nicked the skin and made me bleed, talk about painful! On the off chance it didn&#x27;t tug, it still didn&#x27;t do that great of a job trimming. The head is way too large to be used \\&quot;ANYWHERE\\&quot; as the ad suggests. I was so excited to receive this product, but now I&#x27;m just disappointed and out $17. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> This product should have 5 stars, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not one of those super expensive shavers. It is made pretty cheap...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However all that being said, it does a great job for the price. I have no complaints. I do not have a lot of body hair, but it takes care of my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again I would give it 5 stars, but its very basic. If you are thinking about price, then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a guy and looking to shave your privates without nicking yourself, this is the product for you. I&#x27;ve tried multiple &amp;#34;male grooming&amp;#34; products, and this is by far the safest, gentlest one to use &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This light shaver makes me feel more safe and secure when shaving sensitive areas.  I believe the package insert mentioned that the blade doesn&#x27;t actually touch the skin.  Therefore you wouldn&#x27;t not get a close shave.  Under the product description it mentioned \\&quot;It cuts hairs nearly at the skin line, but leaves some \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; feel. For a smooth, \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; result try either the Cleancut ES412 or ES1080 Shavers after using the Femini PS-335.\\&quot;  Overall, this little tool is good enough for what I want to accomplish.</li>
    <li> This nice little trimmer is very close to a shaver, in fact, because it does remove almost all of the hair. In specific areas, such as on the front of the pubic bone, where the surface is harder, all of the hair is trimmed. On softer areas, where you must pull the skin tighter, it shaves extremely close. Still not all the way down, which I love, because it avoids ingrown hairs and razor bumps, but the hair is so small it&#x27;s almost undetectable.  The shape and size of the shaver makes it extremely easy to manage around the delicate curves around that area, and in the months I&#x27;ve had it, I have only nicked myself twice when I wanted to do a quick job of trimming. (I do not recommend trying to do it &amp;#34;quick.&amp;#34;)  There is no adjustment of length except in how hard you press the trimmer to your skin, so if you need more options, don&#x27;t buy this trimmer. If you just want a really neat, clean-shaven look without all the incredible itching, this product is AMAZING. I suggest using it with a tiny bit of natural baby powder; this will absorb excess moisture from your skin and give your shaving an easy glide, so the plastic doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin.  My partner is sold on it and intends to buy one for himself as well. He says it is also the best male trimmer/shaver he&#x27;s seen.  Dimensions: Length of entire item: 6&amp;#34; Length of head of trimmer: 1 3/8&amp;#34; Length of actual trimmer: 1 1/8&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I expected something nicer for paying $30. I could get one at a store with this quality for ~ $15. Battery that came with the package is no good. And the place to put the battery is loose. Overall, just feels cheap. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> This is the worst shaver I have ever used.  It does nothing it says it does.  This not only does not remove body hair, but it pulls the hair and causes great pain in the process. I do not recommend this product at all. I returned this for a refund.</li>
    <li> It works fine, but its a little flimsy. Every time I use it I feel is going to break. I guess the product is meant to be kind of disposable, but definitely gets the job done. It feels very safe to use. For the price, its ok if it breaks.</li>
    <li> So far I love this thing!</li>
    <li> Originally I was pleased with this razor. As other reviewers said it seemed a bit cheap but I liked the shape of the razor and it did a good job trimming the edges. But when it came to doing a clean shave it failed to impress and i needed to go over the same areas several times. After less than half a dozen uses it stopped working and won&#x27;t even turn on. Not worth returning but needless to say, I don&#x27;t think you should bother buying this product.</li>
    <li> I read a number of complaints from people that dropped theirs and broke it and are complaining that it works but it broke...  Well this product works great on the pubes.  I have had mine for years but don&#x27;t shave more than once a month.  I clean it by washing out the head with water, which opens, and then closing it and applying clipper oil while running it.  I have had a backup for years and have not opened it yet.  Hairs can catch and pull causing pain or bleeding but it doesn&#x27;t happen more than a couple times which is tolerable considering how good a job this litter trimmer does.  I feel completely comfortable using it and the hair length it leaves is just long enough not to cause a rash.  If I could find a more expensive product that does a better job and was more robust; sure I would buy it but I have not found one yet.  Improvements would be things like having a more powerful motor which I assume would prevent any random hairs catching and again a more robust body so if dropped it is fine.  You could easily rig it with two AA batteries or a low voltage power cube to get more power but it isn&#x27;t really necessary.</li>
    <li> For what it is, this shaver is good value.  Just be aware what it is not: first, a trimmer; using it for a trim will not work well.  Secondly it is not powerful, so you need to use it with patience. Finally, it is not a premium product, but then again, it does not cost that much. It shaves cleanly, does not cut, even in sensitive areas, and is very portable.</li>
    <li> Im a guy and keep things neat for the GF (she loves that). I have this over a year and never used it. I was still using my old trimmer that would bite and cause bleeding cuts. I just used this yesterday as my trim was long over due. I was totaly impressed. No cuts at all, I did have a couple of pulls with some ouch. But still will give 5 stars because of the fantastic job it does with no cuts and bleeds. Shaving more often without fear. Perfect trimmer / shaver.</li>
    <li> This product has been around for a while and I wanted to give it a try.  It really does a pretty good job, although it does occasionally nick/pull.  I found that if I go real slow, it barely ever nicks me.  All in all it gives a pretty good trim (not shave), and works pretty well for a guy.</li>
    <li> Update: I have bought this thing 3 different times because each time I try it, it stops working after about a month. There is an issue with the battery compartment. There are better options available for $30 because you will just end up having to toss it because it will break after a month. THREE times this has happened w/ this product. I&#x27;m over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for personal grooming. It is the best trimmer I have ever used. It is very small which makes it easier to shave and prevent cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the quality is TERRIBLE. Low grade plastic and a lot of times it won&#x27;t turn on and I have to open it up and mess with the battery. I have bought this once and it had to be replaced. Now I&#x27;m buying it again and it&#x27;s after the return time. That should show you that I like the results enough to keep buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is junk as far as quality goes. I wish that they would just make a quality product and I would happily pay the extra money.</li>
    <li> Eh it will nick you if your not careful. Works as advertised with a few stingy cuts :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the shaver. I think it is a good buy. If you are looking for a personal shaver,this one is a great choice.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this little shaver and am also glad that I read the reviews explaining how nifty it really is.  It doesn&#x27;t go completely to the skin but it&#x27;s so darn close it almost doesn&#x27;t make a difference.  I am always stunned at how quickly and effectively it works and am very satisfied with this purchase.  Having sensitive skin is a pain but this product makes it so I don&#x27;t have to use an irritating razor.  Anyone with sensitive skin, anyone who needs to get rid of a lot of hair, or anyone who just likes to keep things trim should definitely give this one a try.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so shaving with a razor, waxing, or other methods have not worked for me.  I bought this little shaver a few months back and I LOVE the close comfortable shave I get in the bikini area.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the on/off switch does not seem to stay on entirely so I have to hold it in the on position while using.  Even with this inconvenience, the shave is so awesome, I would still highly recommend this awesome shaver.</li>
    <li> Having never used another brand I can&#x27;t compare it, but I can say that me and my wife both like it. I can&#x27;t seem to get it to shave as close as some of the other reviewers say they can, but it sets things up nicely for a follow-up with the shaver. It has been used on my chest and my wifes underarms and genital area, never nicked anything and mows down everything in its path.</li>
    <li> I orginally bought this to see if I could find an alternative to a straight blade on my bikini line.  I have pale, sensitive skin so shaving with a real blade causes a lot of irritation.  The Cleancut T-Shape electric razor gets really close, and I get no red bumps at all!  You can&#x27;t see any remaining hair in normal lighting inside.  I should also say I have dark brown hair, not blonde.  I haven&#x27;t tried wearing a bathing suit and seeing if I can see stubble in sunlight, but I don&#x27;t think I will.</li>
    <li> Works great to reduce long hairs to stubble.  Wont cut, pinch, pull or harm you.  The safest razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend cause she kept stealing my remington trimmer I got at wal-mart 2 years ago.  My old trimmer still works better than this thing out of the box.  I would not waste your money unless you are only going to be trimming your forearm hair. Not good for anything else. Go to wal-mart or Smiths and buy a remington trimmer for 15 bucks with all the attachment and its rechargable.</li>
    <li> Nice little gadget.  Works great, my only complaint is that it is not waterproof.  Would be a lot easier to clean off it were.  Hopefully they come out with a new model that is someday, I would definitely buy it.</li>
    <li> Opened the product, it was very light, no weight to it. Put it the battery that came with it in. Still very light, turned it on and tried it on the back of my hands. Cut the hair fine and close. You can tell it was not meant for thick hair like a beard by the way it was making noise cutting thin hair on my the back of my hands. I tried it in my lower area and it cut closer than my beard trimmer. You just have to be carefull with this trimmer, light and flimsey...Not a thick hair trimmer... Thin and easy to work with though...</li>
    <li> This little trimmer works great and is easy to carry along on trips. Very reliable and does a great job. Highly recommended for price!</li>
    <li> Overall, It does do what it is supposed to do.  It trims nicely however because of the thin blade it does clog then tug your hair ever so often.  Very easy to clean though, just pull out the wad of hair.  I have found it easier to press the smooth head against the skin, making the blade even with the surface, then going back over it again if need be at an angle.  The battery that comes with it was very weak but a fully charged battery remedied that issue.  Battery life does seem to be very short however, regardless of how fully charged it is; so using it for long periods of time in one sitting is not recommended unless you have a charger readily available or supply of batteries.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is excellent for cleaning up personal areas as well as facial hair for men. It is also a great price for the quality compared to other trimmers I&#x27;ve seen. The t-shape is much better than some of the other angled trimmers. This won&#x27;t get you a completely clean shave, just a very close trim, so if you were wanting to be completely skin you would need to follow up with a regular razor.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price, works like a charm.  No nicks or cuts, works anywhere you have unwanted hair.  A little baby powder helps, but not necessary.  Planning on getting the companion shaver for that extra close shave, but very happy with the job the trimmer does.  Battery life is excellent, and cleaning is a breeze as the blade head pops right off.  The neck will also pop off if you need to clean and lube the moving parts that operate the blade head.  All in all, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am currently stationed in Afghanistan with the Marines.  I have been out here for about 3 months and it was time for some man grooming.  Most people would be able to use a razor and call it a day.  Because of my skin type, that was not an option, due to razor bumps. I bought this shaver and tried it out.  I was very impressed by it. I used it on my underarms, chest and special areas.  I experienced no nicks or aggravations.  I even took a shower when it was all complete.  With other clippers I would experience sensitivity when the soap and water hit the spots just cut, however, with these, it was painless.    The clippers cut very close as stated in the other reviews. The only thing I noticed was if you have a lot of hair, you have to make slow passes.  I found if you only use half the blade surface at a time in those areas, it works well.  Overall I am very impressed and I even ordered one for my wife.</li>
    <li> This is our second unit, the first one we bought several years ago and finally some of the teeth broke, we tried looking for a replacement blade but no one sells them. But for the price and after using for years, it&#x27;s worth getting a new one. Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really powerful, but doesn&#x27;t get so close.</li>
    <li> This shaver worked very well about five times. Now, even with fresh batteries, it does not work at all. I would try a different product before I bought this one again.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with the results after using this product.  The great news is I discovered a fool proof system that works for me.  It is important to note that I am a guy that shaves my entire body.  I use the Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom for the heavy trimming, and then I follow up with the Seiko CleanCut ES412.  Regarding the Cleancut PS335, I would recommend it for very minor trimming needs, such as between eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This small battery operated shaver could be better, just doesn&#x27;t have the cutting power of other trimmers like the conair models. Which is what I&#x27;ll be looking for soon, since I&#x27;m not happy with it snagging and pulling and not cutting.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite shavers, this is the second time I&#x27;m buying it but this time it&#x27;s for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No rashes, no razor bumps, just clean trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> 1st time in 64 years actually owning a non-disposable shaver! When I purchased shavers for my daughter-n-law and grandaughters as a gift, I then relized why not get one for myself?!? There are exceptions to using this product: DO NOT use while showering. There are other DO NOTS, but none that you can&#x27;t adhere to. Please read usage and cleaning carefully. It will truly benefit your satisfaction of ownership. I am very pleased with this convenient item. I use once a week .. so after each use I remove the batteries to preserve the product for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to keep things trimmed up, so to speak. It is small, and easy to maneuver, even in the most delicate of curves. On the whole I&#x27;m very pleased, but the unit itself feels somewhat cheap, and not very sturdy. I&#x27;ll report back if it does, indeed fall apart, but after one use, so far, so good.      Edited to report that within 3 months, this product ended up in the trash- with full batteries it was inconsistent in power, which sometimes led to hairs being yanked out- no thanks! Give this one a miss.</li>
    <li> Utterly fantastic. A smooth shave anywhere and without a pinch or a bump. A smooth running Japanese motor and blades that cut.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to read all of the positive reviews and receive my order.  I wanted this to work and be a good product.  Just out of the box it seemed to work fine and I was initially satisfied with it.  I threw away the packaging.  The second time I went to use it I could not get it to start.  Checked the battery, shook/tapped the shaver a bit and it started.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be very well made or sturdy.  A couple of weeks ago I dropped it (a total of about two feet onto the bathroom counter) and it came apart.  My husband tried to reassemble it, but no luck.  If you look inside the battery compartment, the materials are just flimsy.  For me, this was a waste of money.  I gave it three starts because - for the short time it worked - I liked it and it did what it said.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver, but in my opinion, it shaves and vibrates too fast and you have to be REALLY REALLY careful with it, or else it will leave a NASTY cut.</li>
    <li> This is the best I have ever has for trimming/shaving pubic hair. It gets close with no fears of cuts or nicks. Great price too.</li>
    <li> This little shaver is great, but I must add that our purpose for purchasing it was a little different.  We have a special granddaughter - she has cerebral palsy- and one of the key occurrences with CP is premature underarm hair growth.  Now, nobody wants to shave a 9 year old, but we want to prevent odor, too, so we bought this for her and her mother loves it.  It&#x27;s just tiny enough to do the job and safe enough for our precious little girl.</li>
    <li> It does the job, and maybe it&#x27;s just me and the way my hair grows, but I have to use it everyday and it ends up nicking me. I don&#x27;t bleed, but it scratches my bikini area. Like others say, it completely shaves you with stubble remaining. It doesn&#x27;t trim.</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time and I am so so happy with the results and the way it worked. Great, affordable, easy to use little product!</li>
    <li> This shaver has no guide if you want a trim, and the blades are to dull to produce a clean shave. It misses half the hair or pulls it rather than cut. It took a good twenty minutes to shave and I was left with a prickly pear and had to use a manual razor to clean it up. I&#x27;m a natural red head, so my body hair is thin and light. I would hate to have to use this if I had thicker hair. Ouch! Not worth the $20 dollars. Also this isn&#x27;t the Seiko shaver, the box has ID Corporation as the manufacturer and distributor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this little trimmer (not a shaver)for about a year now.  Changed the battery once and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I can tell it&#x27;s starting to get dull now and needs to be replaced.  Never had a nick or a cut even in the most delicate/sensitive areas.  It doesn&#x27;t shave, but it does trim the hair very close to the skin.  Worth the money and it does what it says it does - except it doesn&#x27;t really shave according to my definition of shaving.</li>
    <li> Despite the positive reviews on this product, I found it to be unworthy of even one star. To start with you cannot rinse it under water and its sole power source is one AA battery. It was also completely ineffective for trimming body hair, and it bit into my skin everywhere I tried it. RUN AWAY from this piece of garbage!!!</li>
    <li> I use this before using my feather touch shaver it shaves all the longer hair and I get a smooth finish with the feather touch. As long as you take the time to shave slowly you will not have little scrapes from the blade.</li>
    <li> This little shaver is incredible when it comes to doing it&#x27;s job...HOWEVER, when it comes to durability, not so much.  An extremely close shave without all the razor bumps. One little drop on my tile floor though, and kaboom. It shattered and was unfixable. So much for that $25.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I personally like a naked garden and this helps to tame it down right before I shave so my shaver doesn&#x27;t get clogged. However, you have to be super careful. The first time I used it, it snagged on my skin and it hurt like the dickens, but it didn&#x27;t really break the skin. When using it, take your time, don&#x27;t rush and make sure to do it over the trash can or bath tub because it&#x27;s a messy job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought one of these before it it was good for about a year.  This one was crap.  Barely started and after it did, ran poorly.  I changed the battery twice.  It is poorly put together.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other personal shavers but none have been like this Cleancut shaver.  Let&#x27;s face it, keeping our privates clean shaved isn&#x27;t always easy and there is upkeep.  This shaver fits easily in my hand, and I&#x27;m not always dropping it.  The width of the cut seems just right too.  It&#x27;s a well thoughtout shaver -- a keeper for sure.</li>
    <li> I used this on my husband to shave the hair on his neck and to trim his side burns and it works great!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still not sure of the longevity of this product because I have used it only a few times since I bought it. But it&#x27;s what I expected in terms of its function and performance. The most bothersome thing for me so far, however, is that it&#x27;s very difficult to keep the blade area clean because there are a lot of tiny spots that can gather the remnants of cut hair. I try to clean it by opening the cap and even with short strips of tape to pick up the pieces of hair. I also bought a bottle of clipper oil to maintain it, which I feel should have been recommended by the seller in the first place. I don&#x27;t think you could use this product for a long time without oiling it frequently, just like other clippers and trimmers. Anyway, I&#x27;m quite happy with it so far, and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my pubic hair before using the razor on it.  So my hair length was decently long, probably an inch to an inch and a half.  This did trim, however it got stuck a lot and I had to keep cleaning it out.  It was more frustrating than I would have hoped.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver because I wanted to get rid of the hairs in some of the more sensitive areas to get a full brazilian. It worked great! It even works on thicker hair. It does get a little jammed up, but can easily be cleaned by tapping the head on something causing the hair to just fall out. Overall a great product. Much better than I expected. It arrived when it was supposed to as well.</li>
    <li> This works just as it was described. Close, clean shave and cut through long hair. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great, don&#x27;t know yet how long it will last. Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged well, priced right. Have only used a couple of times so far.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s up with Amazon...telling me how many words must be in my comet.&lt;br /&gt;Product excellent product excellent product excellent HOW many ways can I say it. Product excellent, Amazon kind of being a pain in the ...</li>
    <li> I bought this as a packaged deal with the Seiko Cleancut personal shaver.  This product came in a package that appeared to have been previously opened. There was no indication in the ad that stated this product was used or previously opened.  I&#x27;m looking for public hairs in the razor&#x27;s teeth.  Product does not look remotely new.</li>
    <li> Was happy with item overall but the battery life is woeful, even if you only use it on bikini area.     I do recommend this is a safe and easy to use trimmer.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these before and loved it. I knew I needed a new one, so I ordered another. This one is horrible it bogs down and even though I put in a new battery it acts like the battery is dying and yes it is a new battery..I tried sevaral batteries to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a battery problem. I am highly disappointed as I loved the previous one that I had and I use it everyday to get the close trim that I need and want. If you can get one that works it is excellent for those areas that you do not want to use a razor on. I am going to try and order another one and hopefully it will work.</li>
    <li> The Cleancut PS335T-Shape Personal Shaver is an exellent product for both males and females if you are shaving in sensitive areas - under arms, genital areas, and nipples. It is battery operated and extremely safe to use. I bought it at the same time that I bought the Cleancut ES412 Personal Shaver. The PS335 trims the hair short enough so that you can use the amazing PS335 to cut hair down to the skin. The PS335&#x27;s small size allows one to shave curves and crevices that would be difficult and very scary to do with a regular blade shaver. Both my wife and I have used it in the most sensitive parts of our genital areas without any problems. When the battery starts to run down and the razor slows down, the shaver can catch and nick the skin slightly if the blade is not in full contact with the skin. It helps, but it is not required, to use baby powder on the genital areas.</li>
    <li> Not a bad trimmer. Weak, but it gets the job done without pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last long even with light usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this item spend a few doallrs more and get a quality brand name product. This thing does a horrible job of trimming / shaving hair. Also it WILL nick and scratch you in certain areas. The motor doesn&#x27;t run at a consistent speed and the unit itself feels flimsy. For $18 and all these \\&quot;positive\\&quot; reviews I expected something MUCH better. DO NOT buy this item not even worth 5 dollars I&#x27;m wondering where these reviews are coming from.</li>
    <li> This worked ok when it worked but had very little power and was not as close of a shave as I was hoping for. I kept having to move the battery or hold it in order for it to have any power. It lasted less than a year and then just didn&#x27;t work anymore. Cheaply made, not worth what they are charging for it.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for males. Quality is excellent and does its job perfectly. The blade is very sharp yet safe. Very light weight and manuverable due to design. Uses a single AA battery.</li>
    <li> So bottom line is this little device gets the job done. There are some problems with it though. First I wish the head was smaller, the thing is rather large to be working around the curves &#x27;down there&#x27; and you usually have to go against the grain to get it. It does take some practice to get it to cut right (need to angle the head just so). Only other problem is it eats up batteries a little to quick for my liking and I wish the blades came apart without having to unscrew them because it does get a lot of hair inside the mechanism while shaving. It&#x27;s pretty easy to clean the majority of it though by &#x27;unhinging&#x27; the top portion. You do NOT want to use this in the shower though, it&#x27;s a horrible shaver wet. However it&#x27;s extremely quiet, the cut is just shy of how close an actual razor works, and it&#x27;s been reliable except when it needs a new battery.</li>
    <li> I did quite a bit of research on this product, and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint me at all... Recommended.</li>
    <li> While its working, it works great. We are on our second one. The first made it nearly 2 years. Toward the end it was starting to pinch and pull a little, thus the new one.   At the price, I recomend you think of it as a long term disposable. In that light, its a great product.</li>
    <li> This is ok, not the greatest. Still looking for one I like best. I just got it so not sure how long it will last.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, shaves down extremely close but you couldn&#x27;t even cut yourself with it if you tried. It obviously doesn&#x27;t shave hair down as close as an actual razor would but it&#x27;s pretty darn close and I don&#x27;t have to deal with razor burn so it&#x27;s completely worth it. When I first opened it I was a little taken aback at how flimsy it felt but don&#x27;t let that fool you, it works like MAGIC! I&#x27;ve owned it for well over a year, use it 2-4x a week, and have only had to replace the single AAA battery twice. Still works just as well as when I first bought it. I just ordered a second one to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s house.</li>
    <li> Works great for me. It does need to be cleaned often because hair gets inside of the unit and between the blades. And once in a while it pulls on hair while shaving which causes some discomfort. But overall it is the best personal shaver I had so far and very affordable.</li>
    <li> This does what you expect it to do.....it shaves you clean and practically bare (if that is the route you are going).  You can rinse it clean as well, but make sure you pat it dry or else it may rust.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I dont usually leave reviews but this product is really great. anyone with a pool or hot tub needs to own one of these. Need to jump in the pool quick, it takes literally 30 seconds to shave my bikini line, and no ingrown hair. i did drop it on the floor and it exploded in a million pieces, after trying to put it back for about an hour, im giving up and buying another one, for the low price, its worth it</li>
    <li> I have tired many trimmers and nothing has come close yet.  Only one so far that I can use on delicate skin.  Still have to go slow in delicate areas but it is much easier on the skin than other trimmers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man with thick chest hair. This thing just wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to cut through it. It started to pull and pinch instead. Sending it back ASAP.</li>
    <li> Stopped working in less than one year after not really using it that much at all actually! Worked well while it lasted.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this shaver for the time I had it.  It is small and gets into the hard to reach places.  I love that it takes standard batteries, and it reduces irritation by not shaving too closely, yet still closely enough. However, I dropped it on a ceramic tile floor and the power button broke into pieces! Now it will not turn on. I&#x27;ve since switched to a small nose hair trimmer</li>
    <li> There are issues with the battery compartment. When you turn the shaver on, it doesn&#x27;t have an even power flow, so it ebbs and when the power is lower, it&#x27;ll pull your hair right out. I bought this because of the good reviews but clearly the quality isn&#x27;t consistent. At least the one I got is pretty junky. It&#x27;s going into the garbage and I&#x27;m searching for another product.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome, only time I&#x27;ve ever pinched myself with it was when I was being stupid and trying to rush it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best!!!!! the best shaver I have ever use. works great everytime I use it. buy it you will love it, I do!!!!!</li>
    <li> This personal shaver is exactly what I had been looking for but couldn&#x27;t find anything that I wanted to spend money on. This was a great price and works perfect! Totally worth the money!</li>
    <li> I should have known that any shaver that could only be used dry was not worth consideration ended up throwing this item away</li>
    <li> Thid is the second time iv ordered.  Great razor, but dont drop.  It does not go back together in a way that can be used effectively.  Close shave, but not if you expect smooth.</li>
    <li> Product is as described, and works very well. Make sure to follow instructions to get the best shave possible. Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> very good shaver I like it. up to now working very well</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if you saw my review on the other piece, but I have had the set for ten years and this piece died after all that time, so I went online to see if they were still around.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did Amazon have it, but I could order JUST this piece alone, so that was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got it today; just used it and love it! I love it even more than the one I had before. Granted, it&#x27;s brand new out of the box but it did everything I needed it to and did it perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I love the handle on this one so much better; it&#x27;s so much easier to maneuver it and I have no problems with tugging, pulling or nicking as long as you understand how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If for some reason it dies, or I&#x27;m unhappy with it, I&#x27;ll update the review, but for right now, I&#x27;m happy to have my old pal back - one that&#x27;s even better than before!</li>
    <li> I loved it when I used it! Kept it stored with the battery removed, but when I tried to use it a second time it just refused to turn on. Even tried a brand new battery.. nothing. I gave it 3 stars only for the saving grace of Amazon. I emailed them to ask for an exchange, and they&#x27;re sending me a replacement free of charge! I sure hope this new one works out!</li>
    <li> This shaver works really well on all kinds of body hair. It&#x27;s fast and super easy to maneuver. It does not provide a close clean shave however, just a good prep for shaving with an actual razor. FYI though, it&#x27;s very loud and needs to be cleaned from the inside after every use or it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> While I absolutely LOVE how this shaver works, I do NOT love the fact that I have had two of them just stop working (yes, I tried putting in new batteries) after about a year of light use and had to throw them away.  This makes them disposable razors at a less then disposable price.  Still trying to decide if I want to spend another $25 or not...</li>
    <li> all I have to say its awesome... love it it works great .... it shaves close and does not cut..</li>
    <li> Works great. No pulling. Close shave. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> When shaving in delicate areas, you want something you can trust 100%. This item does not fit the bill. I have nicked myself plenty of times with these (I have 2 of them). The motor is not powerful enough, so you have to really move slow. The razors will bind up on a hair once in a while. Very annoying. On the plus side, they have lasted for years.</li>
    <li> This unit is the perfect size and has just the right amount of power. It uses AA batteries. The shaver cuts closely, without being to close; no issues with ingrown hairs. It&#x27;s made in Japan. Have already bought a back up.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor... if you don&#x27;t care that it doesn&#x27;t last long. I bought it once, broke after 2-3 months. I bought it again hoping it was a one time mishap. But the second one broke also after 3 months. Gave each one new batteries, inspected all the parts, but nope. It just ceases to work after only a short time. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter was looking for a slim handled battery operated shaver.  She has been very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Seller shipped the shaver A.S.A.P., we had it before it was expected!! Have not used the shaver yet but it feels well made compared to our previous one and expect it will work great! Will report more later.</li>
    <li> Works well, no fuss, no nicks. Just a nice trim for the personal places. I highly recommend this product to anyone needing a no fuss trimmer.</li>
    <li> I would say this is the best shaver I have ever had! There was life before I started using it and there is life after I started using it. It is just amazing! I have recommended it to so many of my friends. Male or female. It is great! I have had it for 2 years now and it works like a charm. I never have to worry about cutting myself or waxing. Less than a minute and I am all set!</li>
    <li> When this trimmer is working I have gotten some very satisfying results. It gets every part you want to get, and doesn&#x27;t hurt or come near hurting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of advice: make sure your hair is dry when you trim, and if you&#x27;re going to trim more than half an inch off I&#x27;d recommend cutting a bit with scissors first, because my hair has gotten tangled in the shaver before and that hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes when the battery is getting a little lower, the shaver loses speed, but still works, and that&#x27;s when I think it&#x27;s kind of inconsistent with power. I&#x27;d say take the batteries out when you&#x27;re not using it and make sure you use fully charged batteries (or newish batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice that the razor part can come off so you can get the hair off with a paper towel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this. I&#x27;ve never had a shaver I&#x27;m so pleased with in the results. I just hope it lasts long (I&#x27;ve had it about 4 months now and sometimes I worry it might not start up again and then I readjust the battery and it works).</li>
    <li> This is actually the best personal shaver I&#x27;ve ever experienced, but it died spontaneously today. I tried three new batteries to no avail. I am frustrated because it&#x27;s beyond the &amp;#34;returnable&amp;#34; period via Amazon. I expect this type of product to last at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is very agile, simple, light and shaves well without creating irritation. Blade is not replaceable, though, so the whole thing must be thrown out if there&#x27;s a problem with that.</li>
    <li> As mentioned in other reviews, the size of this little appliance is the soul of its convenience.  The head is fairly narrow for a T-shaped shaver, and at one and three-eighths inches, it fits anywhere you find appropriate to put it, navigating the sharp curves of the inner bikini area nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minimal flaws that I associate with the Femini have mostly to do with its being battery powered.  As the battery runs low, the blades will naturally begin to slow a little, and you may end up pulling a hair instead of cutting it - owie.  And yes, as the instructions above state, you do need to slow down a bit if the hair is extra long or thick, for the same reason.  Finally, as other reviews have mentioned, it&#x27;s a trimmer, not a shaver; it won&#x27;t leave you smooth as silk.  For that bit of stubble left over, Seiko S-Yard makes the [[ASIN:B001IZZX1C Cleancut ES412 Personal Shaver]], another fantastic little battery operated product.  Together, they work very well indeed.  Why wax?</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have written among the hundreds of items I have purchased over the years here at Amazon.  I am so pleased with this product I just felt compelled to write.  First... note I am a guy, and yes I like to keep my personal space tidy (my wife loves it) and have been searching for an easy way to do this for years.  Every product of this type I have tried that claimed would not cut or nick you has been bogus.  I am here to tell you this one isn&#x27;t.  This product has given me incredible confidence for this task.  It will not nick or cut you and gets close enough to matter.  If you have been searching for something like this, the reviews don&#x27;t lie, this product is outstanding and I highly recommend it.  As a side note, again for the guys I recommend getting the T-Shape handle version instead of the straight one, it makes reach and maneuvering much easier.</li>
    <li> As a cyclist, I try to keep my leg hair trimmed to reduce drag.  This does a good job of cutting through the hair and leaving it closely shaved.  It does not get it super close, there are other shavers that will get it closer, but this is a good general shaver in that respect.  The battery life is ok, I&#x27;ve had to replace the battery twice since I started using it.  I do not think it is water proof, so I would not use it in running water.</li>
    <li> 1. The battery life is horrible, and the casing for it is shaky so that sometimes when I think it&#x27;s dying, I can shake it back alive. Giving it the benefit of the doubt that it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m using bad batteries.&lt;br /&gt;2. I have sparse hair on my legs - I do not think it caught any. I do not see any results unless I run it over many, many times, and only when I concentrate on the few hair I have. The shape is not meant for legs... which seems to defeat its purpose &#x27;shave anywhere&#x27; slogan. However, I do see great results in areas with thicker amount of hair. Great for bikini area!&lt;br /&gt;3. Cleaning it requires taking off the thin plastic on the top. There&#x27;s an odd hole under the razor and some hair have been lost in there. Not as easy to clean as other razors because of this odd pocket under the razor. Easy to cap the plastic on incorrectly. I am just OCD about the lost hairs under there (seems to go to the handle area), but otherwise easy to disassemble and clean.</li>
    <li> Very clean shave. No nicks no sores. Very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Not worth your money. Stopped working in 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Not a shaver, but it&#x27;s the ultimate trimmer--no nicks or cuts at all when trimming up personal parts.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t nick at all and worked great on my coarse hair. Replace the crappy battery that is included though.</li>
    <li> I really like that is has a smooth shave....no issues good safe buy! comes in cute colors...no cuts! Buy it</li>
    <li> Love this. Gives u close shave</li>
    <li> Just a simple trimmer. Makes a little noise, but its ok.</li>
    <li> This shaver cuts very close to the skin but does not shave bare. I use it on my bikini area because I break out in terrible razor burn every time I shave. So far, no razor burn or ingrown hair. I feel safe using it and haven&#x27;t had any pain or cuts. It has a small head which is sized very well for tight spaces. I feel it cuts close enough to look shaved and would happily go out in a bathing suit having just used it. The battery compartment is a little loose, so turning the razor around sometimes causes a small drop in power as the battery shifts in the compartment until it settles again. I could probably fix it by adjusting the battery contacts to make it more snug or adding a little electrical tape inside the compartment. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this little shaver for three years by now, and it works very well for me (I am a woman).  I use it mainly to shave legs, under-pits, and occasionally the pubic area.  For me, its battery life is great (I use Duracell disposable batteries).  I also own Remington WDF-1600 Smooth &amp; Silky Ultra Shaver, which I bought for shaving legs originally, and I found myself abandoning it and using this little shaver instead.  As many reviewers here noted, it does not provide an impeccable shave (it&#x27;s not made for it and it does not claim to do it), but what it does is acceptable for me aesthetically.  It&#x27;s great to travel with.  Don&#x27;t know if it ever breaks (it just keeps on lasting!) but if it did, I would not hesitate to get it again.  I read all the complaints about nicking/snagging and I honestly don&#x27;t get it. Maybe people expect some perfection that is not possible? At any rate, I do not recall any unreasonable painful experiences with this shaver.  I&#x27;m so glad that at least for the very few things like such we can still buy a Japanese product.  Thanks to Amazon for carrying it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well and in fact seems to yank hair out by the root.  OUCH!  It might be OK if the hair was already very, very short but if it&#x27;s longer than 1/4&amp;#34;, forget it.</li>
    <li> Effective trimmer......it does not shave as close as a shaver, but it is not meant to.  If trims hair very small with very little pull...I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Just really trims. Doesn&#x27;t shave to bare skin. Good for when you haven&#x27;t shaved in awhile. Gives you a good head start. But you will have to use a regular manual razor to finish the job.</li>
    <li> My wife used to wax, but it was a pain. Shaving would make her itchy.  This is perfect!  Gets a clean shave &amp;#34;downstairs&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t itch.  And she only has to use it once a week.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> I tried many and this cheap one did the trick i can now cut my privets with no fear of getting cut. It cuts si short you won&#x27;t see but you will feel stubble i don&#x27;t mind that though. Even safe to trim your anus.</li>
    <li> I received this on May 3rd and (as of yesterday) it stopped working. Replaced the battery in it and still nothing. This is utter crap. $30 for one month of usage. Pass on this or you&#x27;ll regret it to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice. The first time lasted much longer and I loved it so much I bought one as backup for when the motor finally gives out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well that moment came and I opened up the new one........ They definitely dropped in quality and don&#x27;t make them like they use to. First one lasted for more than a year! Second one pooped out after a month. I tried using the a Phillips shaver of the same type and it was horrible, so now I&#x27;m seriously debating if I should get another one because it&#x27;s that good, just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> But...if you drop it, be prepared for it to shatter into pieces that won&#x27;t go back together.  I slipped while using it, and it wasn&#x27;t pretty.  But, this works so well, and is inexpensive enough, that it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to replace.  Definitely does the job.  No, it doesn&#x27;t get down to bare skin...but depending on what you need it for, that may be just fine.  Otherwise, there is another product that can be used to give that absolutely bare result.  It&#x27;s not my old Braun electric trimmer...but it sure comes close enough for government work!</li>
    <li> It really shaves well. The only issue is the underarm area. It does not cut as low as I would like it to but otherwise its a great product!</li>
    <li> I think this is a great trimmer. I&#x27;ve never done maintenance &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; with an electric device or razor before so I am truly a beginner. This was really easy to work with, just make sure you do a preliminary trim with some scissors so the trimmer won&#x27;t pull on the longer hairs. I thought I&#x27;d need to go over my bikini line with my depilatory afterwards but this got so close (and I got a little lazy) it felt unnecessary to do so. If you want some length I suggest you purchase something else because what you&#x27;re left with is tiny little stubble. It comes with a AA battery I think I&#x27;ll purchase some rechargeable ones. I only got it yesterday so we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts, for right now I absolutely recommend it.  Update: This shaver is still fully functional, absolutely love it. This doesn&#x27;t cut you or anything, it&#x27;s foolproof.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on personal shavers and liked the feedback on the Femini. I was a little nervous to use it to clean up down there, afraid it could cut, but it does a great job if you work slowly. At one point it was pinching my hair, but I just replaced the battery and all problems were fixed! I highly recommend it for anyone who prefers to trim rather than wax. I can&#x27;t handle the pain of waxing, but this does the trick when paired with the clean cut. No more pain!     I know you can buy extra blades for the Clean Cut ES412, but are there extra blades to buy for the Femini? Does anyone know?     Again, LOVE IT! BUY IT!</li>
    <li> nunca antes habia utilizado productos como este tipo y la verdad que para ser la primera vez es exelente debi haber comprado esto hace tiempo en 10minutos puedes tener todo tu cuerpo depilado es facil de usar no causa no me ha causado irritaciones o cortado como las navajas convencionales y na cuchilla es bien facil de retirar y limpiar no hace falta cremas afeitadoras nada de eso solo colocas las baterias (incluidad) y empezar y ya! lo recomiendo.</li>
    <li> Item arrived damaged due to poor packaging.  I did open the product hoping that it would still work however the item is poorly constructed and probably couldn&#x27;t trim it&#x27;s way through anything.  Please know that I did not use the item but did put the batteries in to check it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product even on the clearance rack.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  I am a male and I try to keep it nicely trimmed down south.  This works well and doesn&#x27;t cut or nic like other shavers do.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has suicidal tendencies. No matter what surface it is set upon, it will dive off onto the hard bathroom floor and shatter into its component pieces. Some of the pieces even manage to seek out those nooks and crannies in my bathroom from which retrieval is difficult so reassemble becomes impossible. The first couple of times that it took the plunge, I was able to reassemble it because it really only comes apart at the seems. Neither of the two that I have purchased really broke. They just come apart too easily. Now that I have been through two of these trimmers, I am looking at other options. If I were to give my review based upon how it works, I would give this shaver a 4 or 4.5. It works really well, but the top of the shave head has a tendency to pop off if the blades get bogged down in my fur. Alas, it is too fragile for this ogre and I will seek something less prone to suicide and component scattering.</li>
    <li> All around good use and safe to use anywhere... Anywhere.</li>
    <li> Worked great for two seconds then hurt!! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> It is still difficult to achieve a clean shave after a few passes. This is like a miniature beard shaver.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not the strongest shaver, but it works for cleaning up the edges of things. It trims fairly close, but it doesn&#x27;t get completely down to the skin, and you have to stop and clear hair out sometimes. I recommend shaving with a more industrial shaver first, and then just follow up with this.</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive skin and does not like shaving with a typical razor because of the razor burn so this is a great supplement for regular razors</li>
    <li> Pulls and hurts... so nothing that they say is TRUE...</li>
    <li> The on/off switch does not work at all. To turn it off I have to take out the battery.  Disappointing!</li>
    <li> I will be using only this trimmer for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a bad first time experience with a different, popular trimmer and it nicked me every curve. I was hesitant about using this trimmer around the curves but it was completely safe! I went against the grain and did not feel a tug or a pull.</li>
    <li> It worked reasonably well for a few weeks until while reaching for something else I accidentally knocked it off the shelf.  It fell to the floor and the pieces could not be put back together.</li>
    <li> I have used it several times. It is very good for removing hair from any paert of your body.  I only drew blood once.</li>
    <li> This thing trims well but will get bogged down (and pull) on thicker hair (thick hairs or a lot of hair). The best thing is that it is very hard to nick your skin in any area.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has worked great, but I&#x27;m sure you can read the other reviews to get that.  My one thing: This product is clearly female oriented. I foolishly didn&#x27;t pay attention, and now I&#x27;m stuck with a great trimmer that looks like it&#x27;s my sisters. Oh well, the sacrifices one makes to look good...      Later edit:  I have found that after a couple of uses, the blades either dull or get out of alignment. I have dismantled the thing to clean it out and get it back in better working order, but to no avail. I will say, it do work well sometimes, but I would say this: Buy this shaver for just a small amount of hair removal. Like this might JUST be the &#x27;fun zone&#x27; trimmer, but this is not the one to use for thick hair or large body areas.</li>
    <li> I have gone through two of these trimmers.  I loved the way it worked.  It gave a very close shave, rather than a trim, which I liked.  The first one lasted about 6 months.  I dropped it, and it fell apart.  I was able to put it together and get a couple of months use out of it with that battery taped in.  I chalked it up to me needing to be more careful.  So, I got a new one 3 months ago.  Dropped it last night (about a foot from hand to tile)  It fell apart, can&#x27;t be put together again.  Great until you drop it.  But it&#x27;s cheap, flimsy plastic and won&#x27;t hold up.</li>
    <li> This stopped working 3 days outside of the return window so now I&#x27;m stuck with a 20 dollar shaver that I can&#x27;t use. It only turns on about half the time (I think there is something wrong with the switch) and sometimes, when it does turn on the blades don&#x27;t move fast enough and I end up getting skin pinched in the razor! I had one of these previously for several years which is why I ordered the same thing again but the manufacturing quality must not be as good. This one goes in the trash and I will look for a different replacement.</li>
    <li> Batteries run out pretty quickly in this, and if you are not use to shaving parts of your body with this, it will scratch you.</li>
    <li> This little thing is FANTASTIC.&lt;br /&gt;WORKS BETTER THEN ANYTHING twice or three times the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this soley to shave my bikini area. This product seems weak and will most likely not last for another month. It does not shave thick hair strands well. I might as well buy a man&#x27;s electric shavor although that might not be good for me.</li>
    <li> I bought the item based on other reviewers. I had another shaver and it would just turn off after too much hair clogged on the teeth. Now, this item doesn&#x27;t clog and turn off. It does what it supposed to do. It just takes a bit of getting used to cause if I press too hard (way too close to the skin), it can cause pain and irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> This trimmer/shaver really does a good job.  I&#x27;ve used it for many months and never nicked myself.  Cuts hair really well.</li>
    <li> I used it one time and thought it was great. Unfortunately I was only able to use it ONE TIME. A month later and it no longer works.     $24.39 down the drain - do not waste your money too.</li>
    <li> Okay so I just received it and used it and could not resist to write a review. This is the best electronic shaver I have ever used. Very light and very versatile. Made in Japan. Best value for your money. It shaves real close and you don&#x27;t get the bumps that a regular razor would give you. I RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> Works very well for longer hairs but is not meant for a &amp;#34;close shave&amp;#34;. Burns through batteries pretty quickly, but I don&#x27;t use it but a few times a month. Balanced weight in the hand; &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It works really well, I just wish there were attachments that came with it so you can trim with it to.</li>
    <li> Ok product, but does not shave as close as I would like, does a good job on what it does trim. no nicks</li>
    <li> this little shaver here takes shaving to another level. it feel like i got waxed cause my skin is so soft and smooth ,barely any stubble</li>
    <li> This gets nice and close to the skin without tugging too much. great product. I would definitely recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> A must HAVE ...this shaves like no other razor!! no nicks or cuts....WHERE HAS IT BEEN ALL MY LIFE!!!</li>
    <li> Works OK but burns batteries rather quickly</li>
    <li> Small and dependable.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin.  Shaving usually results in bumps, welts and the overall impression of an active STD.  Not attractive at all.  This product seemed to be a game changer.  Initially, it was fantastic.  Clean, close shave, no nicks or catching on the skin.  No irritation when I was done.  Like others have reported, the battery case and pieces are loose.  Within a month it was hard to turn on.  Once the initial battery died, I tried several new batteries before it would even turn back on.  That worked once.  It has never turned on again.  I&#x27;m super disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a male with special needs &amp; it&#x27;s been quite a hit. He&#x27;s never been able to shave his own face before, yet now he can. I found this advertised on a special needs website &amp; thought he might like to try it, yet it was listed as &amp;#34;only being available in the UK.&amp;#34; Imagine my surprise when I found it available on amazon.com! Interestingly, it appears to be for feminine use, yet many of the females who rated it appear not to be satisfied. However, I noticed that quite a few males were. I wondered what that was about, but suggested he give it a try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it, he was very happy with it &amp; the independence it gives him. However he did state he needed to use lots of baby powder on his face to get a smooth shave, mostly because he is not used to shaving. Also he stated the battery runs down quickly &amp; sometimes does so in the middle of a shave. And he has to stop &amp; &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; the razor frequently while using it; however this may be &amp;#34;due to the amount of powder&amp;#34; he&#x27;s using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the low cost of the razor, even if it needs to be replaced within a few months, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money! Or as he says, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s worth whatever it cost, especially because it allows me to have more independence.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> works great on my wife&#x27;s Hoo-ha.</li>
    <li> This trimmer/shaver is noting too fancy but it gets the job done right. I use this regularly. It shaves very close to the surface and prevents ingrown hair. It is easy to manage with hardly any nicks or pulling on your hair. Although there were a few times that this pulled on my hair but nothing too serious because I was in a rushing this process.      This product is not ideal for you if you want to adjust the trimmer to cut at a certain hair length. I doubt you would want some design on your pubic area but whatever floats your boat.     Just apply some baby powder to the area before you start shaving. You don&#x27;t get the itchy feeling afterward except a nice smooth skin. Safe to use around the penis with no trouble at all. I never tried using this during the showers nor would I want to. Good product overall.    P.S. The battery I received along with this shaver died out after one use :( so make sure you have a double A battery lying around. Or you do what I do and just borrow a battery from the remote when you need to use this shaver. Replace it after you&#x27;re done and voila!</li>
    <li> It is awesome when it works but in 3 years I have bought 3. However, for some reason it seems the battery connection inside the wiring gets loose. Kind of hard to explain. I am gentle with this and do not use constantly, so it&#x27;s not anything I have done. I think it&#x27;s just not that great of a design when it comes to the battery and connection in there. With that aside, this is an amazing trimmer. I never get razor burn and I am very prone to that and have sensitive skin, which is why I use this because it&#x27;s gentle. It trims very close but not close enough to cause a rash or ingrown hairs or bumps. I would not keep buying an item if it was not as awesome at what it does. I could have given this 3 stars because of the battery issue and the price being a little on the expensive side, but I will keep it at 4 stars because there is nothing else out there like it (and I have tried a lot.) It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> The Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal Shaver is the first electronic shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, so I can&#x27;t speak from experience in comparison with other products in the same category.  Based on my experience with this particular shaver, though, I would say it is well worth the relatively small amount of money it costs to purchase.  I have been searching for an electric shaver that I could use to trim my nether regions in detail and not have to worry about getting nicked and taking forever to finish the job.  The Cleancut Shavy Femini is the perfect shaver for the job.  I&#x27;ve used it twice since I&#x27;ve gotten it and I haven&#x27;t nicked myself once.  I even gave the razor a little extra pressure to see how much leeway I had, and it still didn&#x27;t nick me.  I&#x27;ve never been able to shave such a delicate area so quickly and precisely before.  My bikini line looks fantastic.  It is important to note that this product is not meant to shave everything completely off, but to provide an incredibly close trim.  If you want to get a completely shaven job, you should buy a full-out shaver.  Fortunately, I had the opportunity to read this from other user&#x27;s reviews, and got just what I was searching for.  Like another owner stated, it is actually somewhat of a relief that it doesn&#x27;t shave everything completely clean.  You don&#x27;t get the itchy grow-back stage with this razor.  The trimmer uses a regular AA battery that you can buy just about anywhere, which is very convenient, especially for travel I would imagine.  So far, I would give this product 4 starts (out of 5).  I don&#x27;t know how long of a life it will have, so I&#x27;m knocking of a star for good measure just in case.  Once again, don&#x27;t be confused by the product name.  It is not a shaver, but a very good trimmer.  It is almost a combination between the two.  If that is what you&#x27;re looking for, then I think you will be very much satisfied.    (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review isthat of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)</li>
    <li> This thing is a piece of junk.  Electrically the thing is hosed.  First the battery does not fit properly in the unit and is very very loose upon arrival - despite the unit being in good condition with no signs of damage.  (It&#x27;s just a poor design).  Once I &#x27;fixed&#x27; that issue, the shaver motor never really runs at full speed and in fact sometimes it barely runs at all. The only &#x27;good&#x27; part about this trimmer is that as long as you shave with the grain of the hair it does not pinch or cut your skin even in the most sensitive of areas.</li>
    <li> The only thing I liked about it was the shape but the battery dies really fast and it pulls.  It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other shaver equal in price.  Men&#x27;s electric shavers seem to work the best.</li>
    <li> bought this trimmer for private areas, worked well until i dropped in on a bathroom floor.  flew apart into numerous pieces and is now in the trash.  looking for a more durable trimmer.</li>
    <li> phenomenal from toes to ears.</li>
    <li> Bought this from reading  the reviews.have used it twice and have a nick from both time.&lt;br /&gt;Package states blades do not touch the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Does not shave as close as stated and it does nick the skin and draws blood.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommend for those tender areas. Ouch!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Returning this item.</li>
    <li> I really liked this as a shaver but I dropped it and it broke only after a month. I feel like it should be stronger than that!!</li>
    <li> Eh, not a whole lot to say.  It pulls, so it&#x27;s not the best shave, but it does the job, and it does it well.  It lacks power, and I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s the biggest reason for the pulling.  If I wanted to spend a little more, I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;d find one of much better quality, but for the price, this is a decent shaver.</li>
    <li> this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned in my life, it cut hair so close to your skin that really looks like you have pull out completely , the only way you know that its not true is just touching the skin :) I really love this shaver, great seller also, shipping is really fast, definitely recommend this shaver, I haven&#x27;t tried the others seiko trimmer but im willing to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my wife, however she has yet to use it. I have taken to using it for keeping pubic are clean and neat. It does what it claims to do. It is a very close cut but not smooth. I have not had a single razor bump or in-grown hair after using it 4 seperate times. I would recommend it for men that like to \\&quot;man-scape\\&quot; without using a razor.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical...but decided to try this.  It works like a charm!  I hate shaving.  Hate it.  My armpit hair was all most \\&quot;curler&#x27; length.  Gross, I know, but it&#x27;s winter.  Anyway...normally with shaving cream etc it would take me a few passes and lots of irritation to get a close shave.  I applied some talcum powder and VOILA! Clean shaven in one pass!  I love this thing!  Buying one for my daughter...  Hey, maybe I&#x27;ll even shave more often:}  Absolutely, no irritation.  None.  Best product since sliced bread.</li>
    <li> This is a cutter that was cheaply made and shows it at every turn. The cutter has unpolished edges which scratch the skin while not cutting hair very well. It clogs easily, requiring consistent cleaning. It doesn&#x27;t deal well with thick or thin hair because of this. Worse, it leaves behind a stubble that requires a second razor, a better one, to clean up after this cutter.</li>
    <li> When I received it I was thinking that it looks no different than the $10.00 one at WM. Wrong, it works very well for shaving the nether region! Dust with cornstarch baby powder and it glides and catches hair very well. Super easy and fast to clean.</li>
    <li> Great value here, would buy again!</li>
    <li> This is advertised as a personal shaver.  I don&#x27;t shave personal areas, but this works really well at shaving toes and top of the foot without cutting the skin (which happens sometimes with straight razors).</li>
    <li> This product exceeds expectations.</li>
    <li> It will work on your private areas as advertised (I&#x27;m a man), as long as you are willing to bear some pain. It will hurt less than using razors though. I highly recommend using this in combination with the ES412 shaver, as this device will leave a fine stubble on your skin which will itch in a day or less. It also hurts much less if you regularly use the ES412 and use the PS335 only occasionally when you let your hair grow out.</li>
    <li> i ordered this product two years ago and i still use it all the time. works really well. should be described more of as a trimmer than a shaver, as it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair right at the skin the same way your razor does - which is exactly what i wanted, since the itch of hair growing back in some more intimate places drove me mad the one time i tried shaving. you can apply more pressure to cut the hair down further if you don&#x27;t like the length your first pass through. doesn&#x27;t nick or hurt, although if you don&#x27;t change the battery promptly it can slow the motor and tug unpleasantly - it&#x27;s happened to me about once or twice. battery doesn&#x27;t run down that often though, i&#x27;ve probably changed batteries only a handful of times and i use it one to three times a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 of them. When they work they&#x27;re good, but essentially they are fragile and a real piece of Junk. Brand new they often require tape to keep the battery cover in place. If you drop it, you will be picking up many pieces to throw away. Forget reassembly.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT A SHAVER, don&#x27;t be misled. I had to return this because I thought it was a shaver and that it would ofter a close shave, but it is just a trimmer. It did not cut very close in my experience, and I would have to shave after using it. The cutting blades seem weak and it had difficulty cutting threw thicker hair. I would expect it would break or go dull shortly. If you have thin hair and just want a short trim this may work for you but I suggest you should look for something else.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even last a week! I advise that you save your money. It will break on you and you will feel like you blew money away.</li>
    <li> the real deal... a true non-cutting shaver. out of all the &amp;#34;guaranteed not to cut skin&amp;#34; shavers out there this is the only one that I haven&#x27;t returned. FYI... go slow or it will snag hairs which hurts bad.</li>
    <li> It worked for about two weeks, then it started losing the connection with the battery inside.  I have to shake it to gEt it started for 30 seconds then it dies again.  Rediculous.</li>
    <li> I first bought this in January of 2011. Since then I&#x27;ve used it all the time, dropped it a thousand times(even in water), thrown it around, crammed it in the bottom of travel bags, had it come apart when I dropped it from too high, and who knows what else. And it was still going strong until last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin so sometimes I prefer not to shave with an actual razor, and this does a great job of removing most of the hair to the point where I feel comfortable wearing a skirt or dress after shaving with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people might find the battery inconvenient, but I just use rechargeable batteries with it. For the price, this really can&#x27;t be beat. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I researched many different razors that would help me out in the bikini area.  This is a quality razor that has power to trim your bikini hair. I wanted it shaved (it also helps once a month to keep it very short trimmed) and it works so well. It takes the hair right off so if you wanted designs, it would be hard to do. I would recommend this shaver if you want it really short hair in that area.  Comes with a battery as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered my first one a few years ago. It worked great, until I dropped it and it smashed back into it&#x27;s original factory parts. My husband and I tried to put it back together, but we failed. As it was only approximately $25 I ordered another. Like other reviewers mentioned, it TRIMS hair down to about a 3 day growth from a clean shave, which I prefer.</li>
    <li> Not a bad trimmer for the price....gets the job done. I&#x27;ve owned 2.....as in every product like this the blades will dull after exteded use.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have purchased, only because I had dropped my original one in the toilet.  Sturdy shaver, does a great job and I will continue to buy this over and over again!</li>
    <li> Must have. This item is great. You still need to shave with a razor to get a close smooth cut. But this item gets all the needed areas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now and no problems at all. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shaver works ok, but the cutting head clogs up very easily. I have thick hair and during the first use I had to remove the head and clean several times. I also think for such a simple shaver it is over-priced.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Tiny size that is great for tiny areas.</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades, no pulling.  Don&#x27;t drop it, it&#x27;s not rugged.  It&#x27;s aslo not waterproof, so don;t use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> The Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal Shaver is the first electronic shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have it for more than a year. I use it every two weeks and  I haven&#x27;t nicked myself once. It is very easy to shave and safe. My skin is very sensitive but this shaver doesn&#x27;t make me itchy or give me any rash or red spots at all. I love this T-Shape Personal Shaver.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I was a bit leery when I read some of the reviews, which are accurate... I feel as though I&#x27;m going to break the T-tip when I press it against me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great job, it gets fairly close. I use it every 4 days or so on my chest and other &amp;#34;parts&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t grab hair, though you&#x27;ll want to trim up downstairs before using it or you&#x27;re in for a world of pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a second one, one for downstairs and one for upstairs if you get my drift... Great product, had to take a star off for the shady T construction at the top. Otherwise awesome!</li>
    <li> Battery life doesnt last long.</li>
    <li> Product came as described - did not work as described.    After two uses, the shaver has died. Tried new batteries, cleaned the shaver - nothing will revive it. Previous reviewers warned of this product&#x27;s short lifetime, I wish I had heeded their comments.    The two instances in which the shaver was functional, it worked as expected.  By another product, I can&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This device pulled, tugged and ripped hair in placed where you don&#x27;t want hair pulled, tugged or ripped. It performed abysmally. I returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver so far.  Cuts almost all types of hair down to stubble.  Definetely not for a smooth shave, but there is no irritation or bumps.  Hope it keeps working this well long term, I have had it for about 6 weeks now.  The battery it came with lasted only 10 minutes of shaving, it does go through the AA batteries.</li>
    <li> works great, but haven&#x27;t had one last more than 6 months</li>
    <li> clean shave as advertise</li>
    <li> Feels solid, motor runs hard and does not stutter like some cheaper motors. The blade/teeth could be finer... in fact, I&#x27;ve seen finer. This is perfect for the perineum, and around the ass. It gets pretty close but it&#x27;s not for the scrotum. You need something finer for that... and the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; nor pull. I think it will stand up to some pretty good use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... a good purchase for a man if you want to keep the &amp;#34;taint&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;hole&amp;#34; hair free.</li>
    <li> Its a little less than okay.  The shaver is really just is not powerful enough to be as functional as it should be.  For the price this product should work better than it does.  Cleaning wise, the the top barely snaps on/off with cheap plastic snap edges.  This product is cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Ok ill be upfront, i use it to trim the boys and around it.. use some talc and its a nice smooth cut . doesnt cut low enough to give you ingrown hairs.  BUT use fresh batteries or it will start to tug at the pubic hair.</li>
    <li> Batteries last a very long time and I use this about 2 times a week. Does not nick or cause razor burn.</li>
    <li> The unit arrived quick and on time, seems built well and is quiet to use.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the direction for use, and \\&quot;OUCH\\&quot; .&lt;br /&gt;It grabbed and ripped my hair out. I was already shaven somewhat, but this thing&lt;br /&gt;was a monster and way to aggressive for delegate areas.&lt;br /&gt;I would return it, but it is not defective it is just not designed for areas they&lt;br /&gt;claim it is for.  Waxing would be more desirable to this. Sadly I am out now 25.00&lt;br /&gt;for crap.  Well back to the old razors. Took a gamble and lost oh well.</li>
    <li> broke after one time use, after less than a month</li>
    <li> I do not like the shaver and think it is very nice idea but, the quality is very poor. The shaver does not cut well and is rough on the skin. Not recommened!</li>
    <li> I JUST got this thing in the mail today right after a shower and opened it up and put it to work right away. I read a lot about being gentle with electric shavers so that&#x27;s what I did. I used short light handed strokes. I had a major bush going on and this thing cut right through this hedge beautifully! I did get caught in one of my labia, I think it was a previous ingrown bump that hasn&#x27;t gone away in forever :( So when I examined after use there was a little blood there. BUT I attribute that to me not being able to see what I was doing at that point. Thanks 6 months pregnant belly :) BUt seriously it gave me a close shave and I&#x27;m just praying I don&#x27;t get ingrowns. If you don&#x27;t hear from me again it means I didn&#x27;t get any. But if I do I will be back to update!</li>
    <li> I think they must have redesigned their tooling on this items, as I have had two before my recent purchase and never had to problem of the top piece of the head always coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver for men!  The family jewels are very difficult to clean up due to the sensitive skin.  Typical razors and electric shavers are really too dangerous for this area, but this shaver works perfect!  You absolutely must take your time, but you will be able to get a razor-close shave with absolutely no nicks or pulling.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  If I have to buy another one in 6mo to a year, I will still consider it a fantastic investment!</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer just to clean up around my bikini line.  I am 60, and I am not interested in waxing or any fancy shaving.  This does the trick for my swimsuits.  No pulling, smooth and clean with no irritation.  Not as close as a razor shaves but I am totally happy with the product, and there is no irritation at all. Just a quick clean up in a minute and I&#x27;m ready for the beach!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people complain about the item and it seems to me that they aren&#x27;t reading the back of the box, which has PRECAUTIONS on it. For those of you who don&#x27;t know: Precautions like instructions, but urgent, and if you don&#x27;t follow them the item could get damaged or hurt you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It explicitly states to DRY SHAVE with the trimmer. No water, no soap, no oil, no lotion, NOTHING. It also states to NEVER wash it in water. It even gives you very distinct instructions on how to wash it- \\&quot;\\&quot;wipe it with a CLOTH soaked in a DILUTED water solution of NEUTRAL DETERGENT. Do NOT use thinner, benzene or alcohol for cleaning.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also goes on to state that you need to replace the battery regularly and to NOT leave a dead battery in it (I think this drains the overall power of the trimmer faster). Then it tells you that you should only use it in certain temperatures- \\&quot;within the range of 0*C and 40*C. Otherwise, the performance of the battery will be adversely affected.\\&quot; This means between 32*F and 104*F. So, if you are in your shower but completely dry, you don&#x27;t want the water to be hot because the steam could affect the speed and efficiency of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that you&#x27;ve all been schooled, I&#x27;m going to give my personal review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stood in the shower with the water OFF and started to use the trimmer. It worked well, getting the hair without tugging too much. My hair is very thick, coarse and curly so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when it caught a hair or too but it was completely painless. After a while, I figured I could turn on the water, leave in my shampoo and continue using the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It became more difficult to use the trimmer as I had gotten the blades wet by trying to clean out the hair. Once the blades got wet, their efficiency significantly plummeted. It took longer to trim and it was a lot more difficult for the trimmer to grab at the hair, which had flattened to my skin. The trimmer is not designed to shave- it&#x27;s a freaking trimmer. With the hair flat, and wet, the trimmer was almost useless. I did manage to get it to cut some of the hair but only after I pressed it to my skin- which the box ALSO says to NOT do. AFTER the blades got wet, they tugged at hair if I went at it at the wrong angle. It was a little frustrating but I KNOW it was my fault. I was using it for at least 30 minutes and it only took so long because I had gotten it wet so it couldn&#x27;t even do it&#x27;s job. Another downside to using it wet, aside from it being useless, is that hair clumps up under the blade. I haven&#x27;t figured out how to remove the blade but I have been using my nail to scrape out the wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I finished showering and dried off, I used it again and it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of a diva of a trimmer but it&#x27;s very comfortable to use and it can get anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who had trouble using it- READ THE PRECAUTIONS. You might want to give it another chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who are considering getting it- READ THE PRECAUTIONS. If you don&#x27;t want a high maintenance trimmer, don&#x27;t get it. If you&#x27;re willing to work with it, it will be worth it. :)freaking trimmer. With the hair flat, and wet, the trimmer was almost useless.

    <li> This was a great idea.. the one I had before worked great.. could not find replacement blades and was required to buy a new one.. The product arrived later than expected and for the 38 dollars including shipping the product was ot worth the money</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Cuts real close if held tight to skin</li>
    <li> I liked it the first time I used it.  Shaves everything quite close with no issues.  The problem is that it does not take rechargeable batteries (only rechargeable ones) and it really goes through it so quickly...</li>
    <li> I used to get brazilian waxed, but this is no longer in the budget. This trimmer is the closest i have found to that smooth style shave. I have used other trimmers; some that did not cut as closely and left lots of stubble, and others that nicked the (very sensitive) skin and drew blood.  this trimmer is so awesome.  i have no fear of painful nicks, as it has never done me wrong.  The first one i bought lasted years before dying, and i was happy that they were still on the market.  I bought one as a gift as well.  THE BEST trimmer for all your sensitive ladybits and even your manbits.  This is the one to buy!</li>
    <li> Always runs as if the batteries are low even if theyre fresh. Works ok, not great, because it can pull hair. If tried so many of these types of shavers and none of them are any good. Good luck finding one that works.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t skip this because you&#x27;ve tried all the other sucky $10-$20 battery operated trimmers and hated them.  This one actually works and is a treat to use.  Highly regret not buying it sooner.  This unit makes all the other companies offering the &#x27;contribute to the islands of ocean trash&#x27; ones seem like the devil spawn.  In fact, I&#x27;ll probably mail my two most recent pieces of garbage that I haven&#x27;t tossed yet back to Phillips or Remington or whomever.  With a lovely holiday card. To their corporate headquarters.  Registered mail, signature required.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cut closely enough.</li>
    <li> This product is by far my favorite thing. I used to get Brazilians but stopped due to ingrown hairs and how expensive it is. Trying to find something that could remedy those problems led me here. Enter the T Shaver.  I have owned it for a few months now, and I use it every other day. I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;The name is a little misleading- it is not really a shaver, but rather a trimmer. It trims the hair close to the skin, but does not shave the entire hair like a razor does. I actually like this because I can still get a clean result without getting horrible ingrown hairs. (Which, if you do too, then this product is your BEST friend: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R6UPK/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 Seriously a life saver. Amazon currently doesn&#x27;t have it, but it is offered other sites online. This is the only one which helped my ingrown hairs- so make sure it&#x27;s this specific one. Other creams/pastes didn&#x27;t work for me.)&lt;br /&gt;I have read other reviews that say this product has cut them or snagged them. And that WILL happen IF you go too fast or have long hair. I use it often to make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t grow too long, but it does work on long hair- you just need to go slow! If you don&#x27;t rush it, you won&#x27;t have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;Also, you CAN&#x27;T use this product in wet conditions because it will not work correctly and you risk ruining your battery. So that means no use during your shower routine. I use this before I shower by cleaning the area and then making sure it is completely dry. Then I just stand in the shower while I use it. Once finished, I set it outside the shower,  finish my routine, and then clean it afterward. This does need to be cleaned after each use, and should be. I use rubbing alcohol and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;The battery included didn&#x27;t last me too long, but that is okay because it just needs a AA. I would recommend this trimmer to anyone and everyone! Seriously worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Works great. There is a small learning curve for this item, getting used to the feel of it and the closeness of the shave, but after that, it goes anywhere and doesn&#x27;t cut or pull the hair, if you have clipped it reasonably close with scissors. I don&#x27;t like the powder technique and instead use a pre-electric shave product. It does have some alcohol in it, but if your skin isn&#x27;t cut or super sensitive, this works just as well as on your beard. It raises the hair by contracting the skin so you get a close shave and a clean smell and sanitary conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the companion shaver that shaves to baby smoothness, but it is really useless unless you first use this one to get the hair down to about an eighth of an inch. I see no reason to get closer than that. What&#x27;s the point, after all if the hair is that short?&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts a good long time because it doesn&#x27;t take much time to shave after the original trimming.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is a nice size, fits in the hand and is easily maneuverable to fit in the tightest places.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even used it to trim that awkward place under my nose where an ordinary shaver can&#x27;t quite get, or around the sideburns or back of the neck, but its primary purpose is for those private places, of course, and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve discovered.</li>
    <li> No nicks or cuts, perfect personal groomer.  Way better than the Philips body groomer, get it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not the best for intimate areas.  This shaver works (a little) but it&#x27;s way too course for the fine work needed down under.  A much better choice is the Panasonic swing head shaver available at Amazon.  Better trim, lower price, better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES2113PC-Pivoting-Facial-Trimmer/dp/B0009DT39C</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is terrible.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  I dropped one of these and it literally shattered; the components flew apart.  Still, I really liked how well it trimmed so I got a replacement.  Unfortunately, the replacement also stopped working - with the battery in, the motor fires up but the blades don&#x27;t move.  I replaced it with a Schick trimmer/razor since my previous Schick lasted for years.  Don&#x27;t buy this product, find something that doesn&#x27;t quit after a month.</li>
    <li> Great product, I use it on my lady parts and after following directions (be gentle, baby powder, go with the grain) it gives a smooth shave without razor bump.  This will NOT give you a just-waxed smoothness, so don&#x27;t get your hopes up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m embarrassed to say it... but this thing certainly did work like magic.  Man to man (if you are a man) this will do the job in the &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; areas.  Been searching for something like this for a while!  Now the GF wants one... and guess what - she got one!</li>
    <li> It seemed like it&#x27;d be a great tool after using it once. But literally like the second and third time I used it, it was catching hairs and giving me ingrowns. Didn&#x27;t know it was supposed to be disposable...</li>
    <li> Very great shaver! Works really well. Gets a lot closer than I thought it would which is a plus in my opinion, no razor burn, pinching, or knicks so far &#x3D;) it does seem to go dead rather quickly, after about 5 five-ten minute uses, I suppose that&#x27;s decent though considering its only one AA battery running it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few trimmers/shavers, and this performs above average for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving is fast and quite thorough... for some shavers, you don&#x27;t really get the quality of shaving as from a traditional blade, but this works almost as well without bleeding or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, there are a few points that might need improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This could be because the blade is small, but it gets &#x27;full&#x27; should I say, too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;You could just shake it off and keep using, but a small inconvenience anyway when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not sure how to improve this, but shaven-off hair particles tend to get stuck in the plastic linings of this product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not critical to its function but a bit annoying... so maybe they could get rid of the lining or make it even smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Perhaps making it waterproof could make cleaning easier;&lt;br /&gt;currently the manual tells you not to wash it with water, so after you remove the top part(head) from the shaver, the bottom part needs to be cleaned with wet wipes. Maybe it&#x27;d be nice if I could just dip it in water and swirl it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is an awesome shaver, and I&#x27;m enjoying using it.</li>
    <li> Had to resort to a razor. Battery wears down quickly. I would not recommend purchasing this product unless you are shaving fine hairs.</li>
    <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long at all, this shaver isn&#x27;t really sharp and it is ineffective. It certainly isn&#x27;t worth 18$ in my opinion. Very cheaply made item.</li>
    <li> For years, I&#x27;ve been struggling to prevent razor bumps in my pubic area. This product is really easy to use and leaves me without nicks or razor bumps like razors do. It&#x27;s really safe: I never feel like I&#x27;m in danger of cutting myself and it&#x27;s really good at fitting the curves of my body. It gives me a truly close shave without the pain and hassle. It&#x27;ll save me money in the long run, and will spare me the stress I normally experience. I rarely write reviews for products, but I had to write one for this one because I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
    <li> This device is essential if you want to get the maximum results of the Cleancut ES412 Personal Shaver. It does the hard work of getting the longer hairs short enough so the other device can cut skin close. The initial use may take some time depending on the length of the hairs but may not be needed afterwards if you maintain it as needed or before the hairs grow too long.</li>
    <li> I liked the look and feel of the product, and it worked well....twice....before dying.  Definitely poor quality and not worth the money.</li>
    <li> shaves well down to 1 mm , but still can pull and pinch a hair or two&lt;br /&gt;Not the perfect shaver</li>
    <li> I love this shaver so much that I&#x27;ve repurchased it twice in the last 6 years or so. My skin doesn&#x27;t like razor shaving because it&#x27;s very prone to ingrown hairs, even on my legs. This shaver doesn&#x27;t get you razor smooth but it gets me by for 2 days or so. I use it on my legs, underarms and bikini area. I really like the shape of the shaver since its shaped like a razor. Also it&#x27;s very hard to nick yourself or pull your skin because of the way the teeth are not the same length. The top easily pops off too for easy cleaning out of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these in 6 years is because I lost the first, and then the second was dropped on ceramic floor and broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience a lithium AA battery gives it the most power and bonus lasts much longer.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Just keep fresh good batteries in it to keep it from pulling your hair. Hope it last as long as the S-yard trimmer does.</li>
    <li> I would recommend Shaver to my friends, perfect for bikini area. It has just the right power but easy to use.</li>
    <li> So far this has been a great little shaver. It get pretty close, but not like a blades razor. You also won&#x27;t get razor burn and ingrown hairs from using this.</li>
    <li> This is the best personal shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. It cuts very close for a shaver, and it doesn&#x27;t nick you. I experienced no itching either. :P&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and to use.</li>
    <li> Love it! Close shave and easy to use.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Does exactly what it says, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with snagging, etc. Pretty close shave, as close as you&#x27;ll get without using shaving cream &amp; a razor anyways. Holding up well and easy to clean. I would purchase again if I ever ended up needing a new one.</li>
    <li> I love this, it cuts so well and gently.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This thing broke after i used it three times. Simply stopped working. I changed the battery but that did nothing. I&#x27;m going to try to send it back to see if i can get a refund.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend because I love mine.  It works great and the battery last a very long time.</li>
    <li> This product gives a nice shave but does not shave completely.  You will have to use a close shaver for the rest.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The first use- I thought- wow.... I finally found something that makes personal grooming easy! No more razor bumps! But... the second use... it barely cut... i even put good batteries in it and made sure it was free of clogs. No help. So disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver after deciding that disposable razors just weren&#x27;t doing the job. Well, I have to say that I am very impressed! I am an African American women with a bunch of other races thrown into the mix and to say the least the hair this tool is used for *ahem* is coarse. It is not curly, but it ruler straight. This shaver had NO problem taking that hair out! It is easy to use, cuts close and does not nick! I absolutely love it and will never go back to shaving/waxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer for sensitive areas. It is the best I have used with the fewest nicks. It cuts close but does not bite!</li>
    <li> I loved my first one, but I dropped it and the head broke off and does not appear to be repairable. I plan on ordering another. It shaves very close. Make sure the battery is not running low or it will &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34;. Yikes</li>
    <li> After reading such great reviews, I was expecting much better and am disappointed.  While it does provide a very close cut which I like, the trimmer does pull hairs quite a bit even if hair is already short and it takes forever.</li>
    <li> On and off switch was broke when I received it. Other than that it works fine.</li>
    <li> I used this product perhaps 2-3 times before it stopped working. The battery was fine it just stopped working out of nowhere and no it did not fall or drop. I really wish it would of worked since the few times I did use it it was just what I wished for. I am not buying another one and am looking for an alternative that will last me longer!</li>
    <li> only trimmer I have found that works well for the nads.</li>
    <li> This is the best &amp; easiest way to shave I got two for backup</li>
    <li> Much better than expected</li>
    <li> very easy to use. perfect personal trimmer.....</li>
    <li> It seems to cut or pinch my skin alot.</li>
    <li> This little shaver works really well, and is well worth the price  I love it!</li>
    <li> Product came damaged! The package looked like someone cut it open! The switch was broken in half. Would have liked to try it out but I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Used this to shave harder to reach areas.  It works great.  Not a super close shave, if one wants a smooth shave, one will need something else.  Leaves about 1/16th inch or less than a mm hair left.  Perfect for those seeking to avoid ingrown hairs.  Good battery life, easy to use.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> shaves sensitive areas without cutting or pain this is the best one i have ever found for shaving sensitive areas and skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent personal groomer.</li>
    <li> Works great and has held up for 3 years so far. Tempted to pick up a new one for backup just in case.</li>
    <li> Men, if you&#x27;re terrified of razors and electric shavers alike nearing sensitive areas, your search for a comfortable alternative has ended. Yes, it&#x27;s a shaver, but it&#x27;s different. It is advertised as not nicking or cutting, and they are right. It really doesn&#x27;t. You can comfortably manscape anywhere.</li>
    <li> Definitely exceeded my expectations!  The biggest surprise was that there was NO nicking.  The shave is not close, but it is close enough to prep skin for a close shave from an electric foil shaver.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! It works great on men and women!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but I liked this product enough to buy a replacement because I dropped it and it shattered into pieces after owning and using regularly for a number of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shavy Femini gets the job done.  If you are looking for something with multiple length settings or you will feel frustrated by a device that you sometimes have to rejigger the battery to get it work, then this trimmer is not for you.  This trimmer has rarely tugged at hair and never cut me while trimming, it is easy to use and get the hang of, and is easy to take with you even on vacation.</li>
    <li> This shaver worked fine - exactly as described - for about 3 weeks before it didn&#x27;t turn on one morning.  I assumed it was the battery, and then kept forgetting to put in a new one.  After about a week (you know, immediately after the 30 day return window closed), I finally changed out the battery and it didn&#x27;t work.  So, if you are looking for to completely waste your money on a cheap China product that will die quickly, look no further.</li>
    <li> I bought this product back in August of 2010 and I’ve been extremely happy with it. The shape is very easy to use “down there” and can easily get into the more challenging areas women have to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trimming your hair to around 1/4” before using it; it can handle longer hair if necessary but it tends to pull a few hairs if they are more than about 1/2” in length. Also, use baby powder! I tried using this on bare skin a few times. Don’t. It’s much easier if you rub a little baby powder on your skin so that your skin is extremely dry and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things I don’t like about this shaver. I wish it was waterproof; I would like to use soap and water to clean it, rather than just brushing it off. I’ve not had any problems keeping it clean and sanitary so far but it’s something to be aware of it you plan to share it. I also wish it came with a bag and a cleaning brush. I have both of those items from previous electric shavers so I just used those l but it would have been nice to have those items included. Using a brush to clean the shaver is your best option - buy a toothbrush specifically for this if you don’t have one from another shaver. I’ve hit mine against my hand so many times to knock out hair that I ended up having to purchasing another one (note: it doesn’t like being hit; it still works but I have to tap it to find the right angle in order for it to turn on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, three years, countless uses and it still works well. It does not provide a smooth shave (such as you would get with a razor) but it does a great job removing hair without causing skin irritation or pulling too many hairs. The texture after use will be like stubble for course hair and complete removal for finer hairs. The shave is close enough that the hair would not be noticeable in a swimsuit. They batteries also last a long time (longer than they do in most other battery operated shavers). I hate the idea of waxing and I get really bad bumps when I shave so this has been the best product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re looking for a reliable, easy to use trimmer for “those” areas, get this one! It’s easy and will not cause pain. I&#x27;m looking forward to getting my next one this week, which I will be more gentle with.</li>
    <li> came on time and everything worked great i&#x27;m really happy that I bought this item. Would definitely choose it again.</li>
    <li> Gender: Male&lt;br /&gt;Need: Shaver/trimmer for the nether regions which is electric and nick free&lt;br /&gt;Solution: This very product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this awesome little device for almost a month and use it about once a week. It is compact and lightweight making it completely manoeuvrable anywhere on the body, including the nether regions. I will say first that if you are looking for a clean, smooth shave then this is not the product you want. You WILL be left with stubble - about 1mm in length at best. In the mirror, whatever you can see is barely there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others who have reviewed this little gem, it is ideal for hair already trimmed (&amp;#60; 5mm). For longer hair you will need to make multiple passes along the grain to get the best results. Once the hair is trimmed, feel free to go against the grain to get those that grow close to the skin. When you&#x27;re doing the deed on the little boys, I would recommend to go slowly and gently, and ensure the skin you are passing over is taut (i.e. manipulate it so that the skin is stretched flat). As long as you do this, you will be pain free and have pleasing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: Though this product claims to be nick free, nothing in this world is foolproof (though by design, the manufacturers have done a mighty fine job to make sure it really doesn&#x27;t happen!) I have already nicked myself once and only once (fortunately I drew no blood!). Don&#x27;t be lazy leaving folds/flaps of skin and you&#x27;ll be a happy chappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t quite perform for what i wanted</li>
    <li> This shaver works great! No cuts or pulling and very close!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two and they both died within two months. The second one&#x27;s switch gave out.&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t get me wrong, aside from length of use this shaver is incredible. It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> great. fast. as described.</li>
    <li> I think the only thing that would make this better is if it also worked with an ac adapter. What other people say about this thing I found to be true. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to nick yourself with this even on the fine wrinkles and structures of genital skin. I&#x27;ve had like 10 different micro trimmers over the years and this is by far the best one in terms of safety and closeness of trimming.</li>
    <li> I was able to maintain my man junk with this personal shaver and now I get more action wiht my wife!  Totally recommend man-scaping!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even see the lighter and finer hairs along my jaw line after I used this but I could see the thicker black ones on my goatee. To be fair, I have a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow even after I shave it anyway. I usually shave in the direction that the hair grows but with this i went in the opposite direction for a closer cut. I kept touching my face because I could still feel the lighter finer hairs but they didn&#x27;t feel as course as usual. I realized it&#x27;s because shaving makes the hairs sharper than trimming. I&#x27;ll update when I buy the companion trimmer (use this one and then the Cleancut ES412 for a close cut like shaving)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend.  She used it for about a year and then is just stopped working.  When it worked it did a good job, no nicks or pinching.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love this thing.. WHEN IT WORKS. The first one of these I received a couple years ago worked once or twice, and then wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I got a new one that had served me well up until recently, when it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, I ordered a new one that came in the mail, and wouldn&#x27;t turn on (even with a new battery). Alright, so I ordered another after that and got it today. Guess what! It DIDN&#x27;T TURN ON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry but I should not be receiving so many NEW products that are defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I should start looking for an equivalent trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with th hope that it would be easier to use than a standard ladies shaver on my pubic hair. To my surprise it did exactly waht I wanted and more. I always worried about nicking my labia and the clitoral hood with a standard razor. Well my worries are now over. This handy little shaver shaved all of the parts of my area smooth with no nicks or irration at all.. As I like the entire area to be bald it is so much easier and faster than doing it with the cream and razor that are now a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> great for fine tuning but not for heavily forested areas</li>
    <li> While this looks a bit like a toy, it works wonders if you have sensitive areas that razors just don&#x27;t work for. (I get horrible bumps and ingrown hairs around my lady parts, which is the opposite of fun when you want to be bikini ready).  Since my skin is super sensitive I use baby powder to with it so I can get a really close shave.  The teeth look a bit intimidating, but with the powder you can really grind the thing into your skin, even in REALLY sensitive places.  While it doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor, it&#x27;s great to clip the hair very close.</li>
    <li> Did not shave as close as expected.  Don&#x27;t use this for larger shaving jobs...just trimming.</li>
    <li> There are no blade refills available for this shaver per the manufacturer. Hiss. Boo.</li>
