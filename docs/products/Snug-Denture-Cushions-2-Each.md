### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>both say the Snugs are the best thing they&#x27;ve ever found, and wish they&#x27;d have discovered them years ago.</li>
      <li>Great service.</li>
      <li>These denture cushions are great.</li>
      <li>Great product for great price</li>
      <li>OMG, I am so happy  to have discovered Snug.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy to find the product on line.</li>
      <li>These Snugs are amazing!  </li>
      <li>It probably is good for others just not for me.</li>
      <li>Excellent fit.  </li>
      <li>I use EZO and they are as good.</li>
      <li>but they look good</li>
      <li>The first time my dentures have been truly comfortable which makes me a  happy, happy person!  </li>
      <li>It was okay for your dentures.would rather have own teeth.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making such a wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant about this, but I have to asmit it worked better than i thought without any sort of struggle</li>
      <li>but Glad to know you can still get them.</li>
      <li>Give me EZO and my mouth is satisfied.</li>
      <li>There is no nasty taste or odor.</li>
      <li>ok I have used ezo cushions and they are much better but can&#x27;t find them anywhere</li>
      <li>Also, to get the most comfort you still need to use an adhesive to keep your plate from moving</li>
      <li>The better you get it to seal against your denture when placing it, the better the fit, the suction and the longer it lasts.  </li>
      <li>so they fit and don&#x27;t wiggle any more</li>
      <li>I cut off some strips and fit them into the denture</li>
      <li>Snug is comfortable for you, stick with it.</li>
      <li>Of the various dental products I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the best so far.  </li>
      <li>Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve still got all my teeth.</li>
      <li>but i wore it for a day,and it was not bad.</li>
      <li>I sent them an assortment of powders, reliners, cushions and whatnot, and the very first thing they tried was these</li>
      <li>The nice thing is that they sent a coupon for money off the next time I order.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased them in California, where they were labled as denture reline cushions, so I was surprised to see the absence of the word reline, but the product is the same, marvelous product.  </li>
      <li>Because it is somewhat soft, it molds well to all facets of my mouth, and makes my denture, well beyond the point of needing a reline, comfortable again.  </li>
      <li>this product would be better if it was made to the shape of lower and upper dentures.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my mother who is 84 years old and had used a product simular to this one, but she did not have to cut it to fit.</li>
      <li>I used EZO cushions for years, couldn&#x27;t fine them currently and tried your Snug cushions.  </li>
      <li>Thanks, also, for the reasonable price, ease of ordering and prompt shipping.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>keeps my lower dentures in very securely......will continue to use this product.....</li>
      <li>It did not stick very well to my denture.</li>
      <li>Other than the State of Washington, and South Florida, dentists have caused me more problems than they&#x27;ve solved.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>I am a fairly nimble 62 yr old that still does alot of small craft work with my hands (beading &amp; jewelry making), therefore it is easier for me to fit it into the little nooks &amp; crannies.</li>
      <li>First - only 2 coushions..</li>
      <li>I wish I had found this product years ago it works exactly as it should and lasts long enough to make one feel that they have received their money worth.</li>
      <li>When I did really rush once, it barely lasted 48 hrs.  </li>
      <li>Easy to work with, although a little time consuming.  </li>
      <li>It is the only product for the purpose with which I have been happy, and I will continue to use it until I get new, permanent dentures in a little less than a year.  </li>
      <li>now they fit tight</li>
      <li>The moldable thermoplastic is a nice soft cushion between my gums an the hard plasticness of my upper plate.</li>
      <li>It was snug and soft</li>
      <li>They do seem to work better than other products I have tries.  </li>
      <li>no mess, no fuss...., just cut to shape.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product for my mother, a long time denture wearer, and she found this product to work very well.</li>
      <li>I found Snug works pretty well except they do not last very long.</li>
      <li>This works good for the cushioning but due to the pressure applied, this will eventually thin out and migrate out of the denture.  </li>
      <li>Soft enough to trim.</li>
      <li>Snugs stick to their dentures like glue, and also stick to their gums just dandy (something the Ezo&#x27;s didn&#x27;t, apparently).</li>
      <li>Was very hard to cut to the proper shape and fit for dentures.  </li>

<li> It was an idiot dentist in South Carolina (St. Helena Island to be precise) that caused me to need a full plate to begin with.  </li>

<li> the lady I got it for was allways complaining about her teeth being loose until I got her snug for her upper teeth</li>
<li> I would not recommend this product for an aged person with arthritis.&lt;br</li>
<li> The cushion in a tube only lasts a few days and does not work as an adhesive as advertised.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, they also threw out the packaging for that box of denture products, because once they tried the Snugs they&#x27;re done looking, but can&#x27;t return over a hundred bucks worth of stuff</li>
<li> The package came when it was expected.</li>
<li> I searched high and low and was unable to find Snug in any store.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste even this little amount of money as this is a total dud!My bottom dentures weren&#x27;t one bit snugger.</li>
<li> It is work getting it seated and holding tightly.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> My mother said she&#x27;s always had the problem of having to readjust her lowers after every few bites of food, but no more, because the Snugs stay in place</li>
<li> My husband has used Snug for the past 7 years to cushion his bottom plate.</li>
<li> Bottom teeth are hard to control.</li>
<li> I told the what it was selling for on the secondary marketing ($150+ per tube).</li>
<li> He broke my crowns which made my built in bar support and partial useless.  </li>
<li> But, I personally would appreciate if you would contact the makers of Cushion Grip, and express your disappointment and inconvenience of them taking it off the market.  </li>
<li> idea that you need to see a dentist is ridiculous.</li>
<li> reline kits worked for awhile, but then because of their hardness, they became irritating again.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been uncomfortable ever since.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I cannot find these anyplace in Oregon.  </li>
<li> Too expensive to keep doing this.</li>
<li> Delivery time is very poor however.</li>
<li> Snug is disappointing product.</li>
<li> I was a 7 yr user of Cushion Grip, until the idiots at Sheringer-Plough</li>
<li> not what I thought it would do, hate it</li>

    <li> I was hesitant about this, but I have to asmit it worked better than i thought without any sort of struggle</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my mother, a long time denture wearer, and she found this product to work very well.</li>
    <li> These Snugs are amazing!  The first time my dentures have been truly comfortable which makes me a  happy, happy person!  I&#x27;d be lost without these.</li>
    <li> Great product for great price</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectaitions.  Was very hard to cut to the proper shape and fit for dentures.  Would not recomend</li>
    <li> My denture now fits using Snug denture cushions, I wish these were sold in stores still. but Glad to know you can still get them. Thanks.</li>
    <li> They are pricey, since you have to change them every day.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t last like they are suppose to, not for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> my gums are still sore but i wore it for a day,and it was not bad.It was snug and soft</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  They do not work.</li>
    <li> My husband has used Snug for the past 7 years to cushion his bottom plate. Last month we went to the Pharmacy to purchase another box and they had none. I searched high and low and was unable to find Snug in any store. I was so happy to find the product on line. Snug is the only product that my husband can use. He loves this product. I will continue to order Snug on line until I find a store that sells it.</li>
    <li> They are O.K. I use EZO and they are as good. Bottom teeth are hard to control.</li>
    <li> Of the various dental products I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the best so far.  I only have a lower, so this doesn&#x27;t address the upper at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reline kits worked for awhile, but then because of their hardness, they became irritating again.  The cushion in a tube only lasts a few days and does not work as an adhesive as advertised.  This works good for the cushioning but due to the pressure applied, this will eventually thin out and migrate out of the denture.  Also, to get the most comfort you still need to use an adhesive to keep your plate from moving around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that you need to see a dentist is ridiculous. Other than the State of Washington, and South Florida, dentists have caused me more problems than they&#x27;ve solved.  It was an idiot dentist in South Carolina (St. Helena Island to be precise) that caused me to need a full plate to begin with.  He broke my crowns which made my built in bar support and partial useless.  Then I ended up at one of those production line denture factories, and they did a lousy job in manufacture, fitting, and could only spare 30 seconds of their time for questions. I&#x27;ve been uncomfortable ever since. 3-4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Snug is comfortable for you, stick with it. Delivery time is very poor however.</li>
    <li> keeps my lower dentures in very securely......will continue to use this product.....no mess, no fuss...., just cut to shape.Rita, Orlando, Fl.</li>
    <li> It is not what I thought it would be, it works ok I have used ezo cushions and they are much better but can&#x27;t find them anywhere</li>
    <li> It was okay for your dentures.would rather have own teeth. I would recomand to anyone to use.Tell everyone this works.</li>
    <li> These denture cushions are great. I cut off some strips and fit them into the denture so they fit and don&#x27;t wiggle any more and I can now eat and chew in comfort. Another life saver.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve still got all my teeth. However, my 84-year-old mother and 82-year-old father have been using EZO cushions since the 1960&#x27;s, so when they couldn&#x27;t find them they asked my help in locating a replacement. I sent them an assortment of powders, reliners, cushions and whatnot, and the very first thing they tried was these, Snug denture cushions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, they will never need to change products again. Unfortunately, they also threw out the packaging for that box of denture products, because once they tried the Snugs they&#x27;re done looking, but can&#x27;t return over a hundred bucks worth of stuff so I can get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even Ezo will take the place of the Snugs (which is why I&#x27;m writing this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both say the Snugs are the best thing they&#x27;ve ever found, and wish they&#x27;d have discovered them years ago. Snugs stick to their dentures like glue, and also stick to their gums just dandy (something the Ezo&#x27;s didn&#x27;t, apparently). My mother said she&#x27;s always had the problem of having to readjust her lowers after every few bites of food, but no more, because the Snugs stay in place so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, they both claim the Snugs last for weeks before they need changed. I hope this review helps people decide to try them, judging by how ecstatic my folks are about them.</li>
    <li> OMG, I am so happy  to have discovered Snug.  I was a 7 yr user of Cushion Grip, until the idiots at Sheringer-Plough (So?) Pharmaceuticals discontinued making it.  I contacted them &amp; was told it was not a profitable product for them.  I told the what it was selling for on the secondary marketing ($150+ per tube). They did not believe me.  I told them to check eBay &amp; Amazon themselves.  I think it might go back into production if any body around there has a brain.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now about the Snug.  I can&#x27;t believe how well this works in replacing the CG. The moldable thermoplastic is a nice soft cushion between my gums an the hard plasticness of my upper plate. There is no nasty taste or odor. Easy to work with, although a little time consuming.  The better you get it to seal against your denture when placing it, the better the fit, the suction and the longer it lasts.  I have had a Snug liner last for almost 3 wks. When I did really rush once, it barely lasted 48 hrs.  Moisture between Snug and your plate is the nemesis. It will not hold or adhere to the plate once the seal is compromised.  It is work getting it seated and holding tightly. I am a fairly nimble 62 yr old that still does alot of small craft work with my hands (beading &amp; jewelry making), therefore it is easier for me to fit it into the little nooks &amp; crannies. It will give and stretch somewhat from the heat conducted from working it with your touch.  I would not recommend this product for an aged person with arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;If I would call it a criticism, my only complaint is that it would be much easier to apply if it was formed in the shape of the plates themselves.  The Snug itself is in a square and hangover has to be trimmed. If you were a faithful lover &amp; supporter of the Cushion Grip, this product will satisfy your needs. But, I personally would appreciate if you would contact the makers of Cushion Grip, and express your disappointment and inconvenience of them taking it off the market.  Just pull up a picture of the box to get the correct spelling and Goggle it for their contact info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hope this copy of War &amp; Peace sized product review is helpful.p a picture of the box to get the correct spelling and Goggle it for their contact info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hope this copy of War &amp; Peace sized product review is helpful.</li>
    <li> this product would be better if it was made to the shape of lower and upper dentures. I ordered this for my mother who is 84 years old and had used a product simular to this one, but she did not have to cut it to fit.</li>
    <li> First - only 2 coushions.. Soft enough to trim. Did not adhere to denture as stated and moved around alot. Had to use adhesive to keep snug from moving. Too expensive to keep doing this. It probably is good for others just not for me.</li>
    <li> Great service. The package came when it was expected. The nice thing is that they sent a coupon for money off the next time I order.</li>
    <li> I found Snug works pretty well except they do not last very long. They do seem to work better than other products I have tries.  I will try them again.</li>
    <li> I used EZO cushions for years, couldn&#x27;t fine them currently and tried your Snug cushions.  Excellent fit.  Highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> not what I thought it would do, hate it</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I cannot find these anyplace in Oregon.  The only denture temporary reline product I can find is a resin based product that burns my mouth (they call it tingling - HAH!). I originally purchased them in California, where they were labled as denture reline cushions, so I was surprised to see the absence of the word reline, but the product is the same, marvelous product.  Because it is somewhat soft, it molds well to all facets of my mouth, and makes my denture, well beyond the point of needing a reline, comfortable again.  It is the only product for the purpose with which I have been happy, and I will continue to use it until I get new, permanent dentures in a little less than a year.  Thank you for making such a wonderful product.  Thanks, also, for the reasonable price, ease of ordering and prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> the lady I got it for was allways complaining about her teeth being loose until I got her snug for her upper teeth now they fit tight so I give snug 5 stars</li>
    <li> Snug is disappointing product. It did not stick very well to my denture. Then it oozed out from the sides of the denture. It did not last for even a day. All this for $42 ($6 + Shipping). I will never buy another product from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used EZO for years and this just doesn&#x27;t does not work for me. Give me EZO and my mouth is satisfied.</li>
    <li> Did not have a chance to use them yet but they look good&lt;br /&gt;Looks like they will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste even this little amount of money as this is a total dud!My bottom dentures weren&#x27;t one bit snugger.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this product years ago it works exactly as it should and lasts long enough to make one feel that they have received their money worth.</li>
