      <li>so well I wish I could give it more stars.</li>
      <li>It has a nice odor, goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>Works well most days</li>
      <li>As a clinical protection, you would need a lot more of it before even the smallest clinic could withstand a sharknado or hurricane........</li>
      <li>The scent was okay</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m allergic to most scents.</li>
      <li>my husband reports that it works better if applied at night per the package&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
      <li>I love Dove soap,</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every clinical strength deodorant I&#x27;ve been able to find.  </li>
      <li>wish i could give more details.</li>
      <li>I find that applying it the night before yields better results than the day of.</li>
      <li>It works great when it&#x27;s cold/dry out, but then I don&#x27;t expect to sweat much in those situations anyways.  </li>
      <li>I am still using it and it works better than any product I have ever used in my lifetime.</li>
      <li>will purchase again for sure.</li>
      <li>and I love the smell.</li>
      <li>Regular deodorant doesn&#x27;t work for my son but this works excellent.  </li>
      <li>I like the dove that is unisex or gillette both much better than this.  </li>
      <li>more than 8hrs job.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does leave a noticeable residue, but I&#x27;ll gladly trade that for the sweaty alternative.</li>
      <li>Love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t say that it works any better than the non clinical deodorant.</li>
      <li>To date, this is my favorite type of deodorant.</li>
      <li>Absolutely my favorite deodorant &amp; antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was always a sweaty dude before finding this deodorant - I can&#x27;t believe how many shirts I sweat through before I knew that this existed.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It might not protect a clinic, but it sure did a great job keeping me clean and fresh smelling for ~48 hours.  </li>
      <li>Just love this deodorant, works pretty fine and smells really good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good overall, good scent and protects the skin and leaves no stain in the clothes</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette&#x27;s Clinical for years now, as it was one of the first ones on the market, and so far seems to be the best one for me.</li>
      <li>but when I tried this out it was a lot more comfortable to put on than the others I have tried.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>As a sensitive skin deodorant and antiperspirant, this stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, more like just a clean laundry smell which I like.  </li>
      <li>stays on for 24 hrs  easy.</li>
      <li>Been using their soap for years &amp; happy to add more personal care products!</li>
      <li>This does have an scent but is very mild and not perfumed.</li>
      <li>They need a strong product</li>
      <li>This antiperspirant/deodorant works fine.  </li>
      <li>I have struggled with sweating through shirts for years, this stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>i have try many and many others but so far its my favorite...</li>
      <li>It ended up being a great alternative for me after the traditional Dove deodorant created some irritation.</li>
      <li>This is a great product: gentle on the skin &amp; really works well.  </li>
      <li>This antiperspirant works very well and the smell is pretty good but mild and not overbearing.</li>
      <li>I have troubles with most deodorants, having sensitive skin, most cause rashes or irritate my skin.  </li>
      <li>Bought some of these because the price was great at the time, and the clinical protection keeps me totally dry!</li>
      <li>Smells great and keeps me dry!</li>
      <li>It still works, but it&#x27;s more of a flat circle than a nice curved/contour oval.</li>
      <li>Most of the others either have strong smells that are overwhelming or cause moderate irritation.</li>
      <li>I own a clinic, and am always worried about protecting it - with natural disasters, fires, floods, etc.</li>
      <li>Works good just wish it was a bigger bottle.</li>
      <li>Lastly, and most importantly, it does not irritate my skin, which most deodorants tend to do now.</li>
      <li>cheap, fast, easy to buy...</li>
      <li>Stay dry and smell nice all day!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It pays to follow the directions-- my husband reports that it works better if applied at night per the package&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
    <li> I own a clinic, and am always worried about protecting it - with natural disasters, fires, floods, etc. clinics are always at risk.  So when I saw that I could get Dove clinical protection for only $7 bucks, I thought my dreams had come true....but alas! I was a victim of a deception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got my package in the mail in two days due to Amazon Prime&#x27;s preternatural shipping speed, I was all excited, and started rubbing the clinical protection deodorant all over my clinic.  But I realized that there was not enough product in the bottle to coat even a single wall of the clinic - how can this product claim &amp;#34;clinical protection&amp;#34; if it cannot even protect a single wall of that clinic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The anger an hurt caused me to sweat, and made me a bit ripe.  I have troubles with most deodorants, having sensitive skin, most cause rashes or irritate my skin.  So here I was, with an unprotected clinic, starting to smell.  So I took a shower, and used my little remaining product just as a deodorant.  Wow!  It might not protect a clinic, but it sure did a great job keeping me clean and fresh smelling for ~48 hours.  As a sensitive skin deodorant and antiperspirant, this stuff is great.  As a clinical protection, you would need a lot more of it before even the smallest clinic could withstand a sharknado or hurricane........</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin. However, it doesn&#x27;t stop perspiration as good as done other clinical brands.</li>
    <li> My husband is a naturally musky guy. I don&#x27;t mind a hint of body odor, it&#x27;s natural! But my husband can step out of the shower and start smelling right away. Plus he works in construction so he is outdoors a lot and in coveralls! For 10+ years he smelled horrible and no deodorant really helped much at all. Until I found this! It works so well I wish I could give it more stars. Plus it doesn&#x27;t make them smell like a cologne factory or any sickending smell some deodorants have. If you have a musky man in your life buy this for them, your nose will thank you!</li>
    <li> Pretty great for keeping you from sweating</li>
    <li> Smells great, nice and subtle, and works great!</li>
    <li> Strong protection! It does a great job of keeping me stink-free. My wife loves the scent so if she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This product works well as an antii-perspirant, but it is less effective at odor prevention than other &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; brands such as Gillette.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a super sweaty or stinky guy, but I&#x27;ve found that this has worked really well for me.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, more like just a clean laundry smell which I like.  I find I use less of this than I typically would other sticks. So, it lasts pretty long for me.  I found it at Target a few years ago and now I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere but Amazon.  My only complaint is the price.</li>
    <li> My husband really loves it, he switched to this product and now he only uses this deodorant. Also it does not leave residue</li>
    <li> The scent was okay but it was a little sticky after application</li>
    <li> Nice scent. Not great at preventing wetness.</li>
    <li> Despite being a smaller size than normal deodorant, it&#x27;s still a great at what it was designed for.</li>
    <li> I think it works pretty well. I&#x27;m not a horrible sweater like some, but it does keep me dryer during those awful summer days.</li>
    <li> The product works great, I am not sweating as much anymore, BUT now I am itching like crazy. So I guess I must be allergic to whatever is in that product. Its a shame, because I liked it.</li>
    <li> Husband likes this deodorant</li>
    <li> stays on for 24 hrs  easy. happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Smells great and keeps me dry! Packaging is perfect. Whole items is not full but it&#x27;s nothing any other company will do.</li>
    <li> Nice powdered and pleasant aroma.  Superior dryness.  Still prefer the right guard 72 hour gel tho.  I like to use this as an all over powder.... My wife goes nuts at the smell!</li>
    <li> Less sweating, less smelling, I even went 2 days without applying more and I still had fresh smelling under arms</li>
    <li> I have been Dove clinical protection (green tea)for the past three years.  It was the only antiperspirant that worked without causing me to break out with a crazy rash.  Luckily, Dove finally created a more masculine scent so that I no longer have to walk around smelling like a subdued Bath and Body Works store...</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and most deodorants/anti antiperspirants dry my skin too much. This is the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin yet keeps me dry all day (unless  you&#x27;re in 100% humidity, in which case move out of the Amazon (cough Florida cough)). Subscribe and save to this and you&#x27;ll save a few dollars too.</li>
    <li> After using many different antiperspirants this one is the first over-the-counter one that is effective for me.  It works just as well, if not better, than the prescription antiperspirant I was using.  You put it on at night and then it lasts the entire next day for me, this is when most prescription antiperspirants are applied as well.</li>
    <li> I have gone through a few deodorants and this one actually works! It is more expensive than a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; one, but it is totally worth it.</li>
    <li> We tried cheap brands all the way to this one for a good 7 years trying to find a good match.  Hands down the clinical is the only one that works for my husband.  Great for everyday,  workouts,  and theme parks.  Before hehe started using this one,  all the arm pits of his clothes would stain and he would smell,  but not after using this.  No more smelly husband or stains on the armpits of his shirts.  By far hands down our top choice...ever.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue.</li>
    <li> Thank God for Amazon, as this is hard to find in stores!  And Amazon&#x27;s price is competitive too!  This is a great product: gentle on the skin &amp; really works well.  You only need a small amount.  When my shaving creme is finished I&#x27;ll try the Dove product.  Been using their soap for years &amp; happy to add more personal care products!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. It smells great and does it&#x27;s job. My husband has sensitive skin. Some deodorant causes rashes under his arms. This stuff doesn&#x27;t do that. Good product.</li>
    <li> The item was exactly as it was described and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> To date, this is my favorite type of deodorant. It smells nice, but not overpowering. It&#x27;s strong enough to last the entire day on a man&#x27;s armpit (I can use it the night before I sleep and not notice any stink until two mornings after - 36 hours, although that only happened by necessity). Lastly, and most importantly, it does not irritate my skin, which most deodorants tend to do now. I only wish I could order in larger quantities.</li>
    <li> The best Deodorant i use it always ..i have try many and many others but so far its my favorite...</li>
    <li> It works. Even after you shower. It almost works too well. No skin irritation. It&#x27;s kind of hard to wash off.</li>
    <li> Great deal.&lt;br /&gt;My hubby tried it for the first time and we are now Dove Men&#x27;s care fans.&lt;br /&gt;will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this and it is awesome! Dry and clean all day even Thou it&#x27;s hot and humid out there</li>
    <li> Regular deodorant doesn&#x27;t work for my son but this works excellent.  Great price as well. will purchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> I am still using it and it works better than any product I have ever used in my lifetime. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this, but every time I wear it and there&#x27;s any amount of humidity I seem to sweat a lot more than normal in the underarm area.  It causes the deodorant to stick to whatever shirt I&#x27;m wearing and make a kind of soapy mess.  It works great when it&#x27;s cold/dry out, but then I don&#x27;t expect to sweat much in those situations anyways.  I&#x27;ve switched back to the old spice fiji and it&#x27;s doing a great job.</li>
    <li> First time trying this, It works but it has it&#x27;s limitations. I find that applying it the night before yields better results than the day of.</li>
    <li> my husband was really unhappy with this deodorant.  i will never buy again.  wish i could give more details.</li>
    <li> cheap, fast, easy to buy... i like it</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s not terrible, it&#x27;s priced in the range of all the other clinical strength deodorants and is not quite up to par with their quality.  I am a very sweaty guy.  My friends make fun of me because we can be sitting by an a/c unit, and I&#x27;m still sweating.  It&#x27;s just how I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every clinical strength deodorant I&#x27;ve been able to find.  I love Dove soap, so figured I&#x27;d give this a go.  While it is certainly not terrible, and will get the job done for most people, it&#x27;s just not as good as the others.  If it was a lot cheaper, I&#x27;d probably still use it as it does offer relief.  But, I still found myself sweating in multiple occasions (although much less).  At a very similar price point you can buy Gillette clinical strength.  This is by far the best on the market.  You cannot go wrong with Gillette for razor&#x27;s and deodorant.</li>
    <li> Bought some of these because the price was great at the time, and the clinical protection keeps me totally dry! I used to sweat at night and when I shower in the morning I often make note of the fact that I have to use shampoo under my arms because the deodorant still hasn&#x27;t worn off from the day before. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I think this stuff takes a while to kick-in but I&#x27;ve gone from pouring sweat out of my pits (sometimes in a cool room, under non-stressful conditions) to putting this on about once a week and feeling dry as a bone -- unless I&#x27;m working out.  I get a little skin irritation, and some may find the tackiness unpleasant, but I think this product is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Edit, March 2015: I don&#x27;t know what happened.  It might be a change in the product formula or it might be a change in my body.  Dove clinical used to dry out my pits completely and consistently.  Then everything changed.  Without changing my routine I began to sweat more and more until I was simply pouring sweat out of my armpits for no reason.  You know it&#x27;s bad when you&#x27;re stuffing napkins into your armpits every 15 minutes and still creating huge sweat patches on your shirts.  A radical change was needed and I decided to ditch aluminum based anti antiperspirants for a while.  Day by day I noticed less pit sweating.  For the last couple of weeks I&#x27;ve put nothing in my pits but a couple of squirts of cologne to keep the BO away and I&#x27;m dry as a bone.  Excessive sweating is a source of huge embarrassment and physical discomfort for many people and I would say this product is worth a try if you&#x27;re desperate -- we all react so differently to different products.  For me, I can honestly say that Dove now makes me sweat more than when I wear no antiperspirant at all.</li>
    <li> the grandsons love it</li>
    <li> I was having a skin allergy before I started using this, and I think this definitely helped.  That said, it kinda smells like nothing.  Which, maybe is a good thing?  Unsure.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant. Maybe it&#x27;s the clinical strength, but it works very well for me.  I have used for years.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with sweating through shirts for years, this stuff is fantastic. Gets the job done and without any irritation. So far I&#x27;ve switched two friends over to Dove Men+Care Clinical Protection, and they have the same to say for it! Great stuff.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, buy this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to make it last, barely put it on, it spreads and works well .... If one stick isn&#x27;t lasting at least 45-60 days, you are doing it wrong!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good overall, good scent and protects the skin and leaves no stain in the clothes but it&#x27;s not good on my husband more than 8hrs job.</li>
    <li> I like the dove that is unisex or gillette both much better than this.  This does not perform as well for me.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is suppose to do, stop the sweat and last all day. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great smelling deodorant that does what it claims to do. It ended up being a great alternative for me after the traditional Dove deodorant created some irritation. I&#x27;m definitely happy to pay the extra $ for this since it works better with less irritation than other products.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Costs a bit more, but if you are a sweater look no further. Stay dry and smell nice all day!</li>
    <li> Had difficulty with antiperspirants in past causing a rash that progressively worsens with continued use, even those that are dermatologically tested, scent free, and made by same company.  Dove Men+care has been the only antiperspirant that does not cause a reaction, and works just as well or better than others.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Works well most days and I sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> Happy with this and wonderful with the subscribe and save! I used to buy stuff from Costco but when I tried this out it was a lot more comfortable to put on than the others I have tried. I completely prefer this!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is great but it&#x27;s poor at keeping wetness away.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this deodorant. I play sports, and perspire. Clinical protection was a lie. DOVE let me down.</li>
    <li> Great all day protection.  It really lasts and far superior over the &amp;#34;non-clinical&amp;#34; stuff.</li>
    <li> Very good deodorant but I can&#x27;t say that it works any better than the non clinical deodorant.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, although its not a deal breaker I&#x27;m not a fan of the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Works well, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Works good just wish it was a bigger bottle. Overall, have been using the past few months and works well.</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant/deodorant works fine.  It is hypoallergenic, so it does not irritate.  But it smells like baby powder--not a particularly manly scent.</li>
    <li> Just love this deodorant, works pretty fine and smells really good</li>
    <li> only deodorant that works for me.</li>
    <li> Just about the only deodarant that works for me.</li>
    <li> its nice. with coupons it was cheaper on this site than at CVS</li>
    <li> It works if you put it on at night like they say.. I just hate putting it on at night!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line of products for quite a few years, before using the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength I would often sweat through my shirts during the day performing normal daily activities.  I no longer have that problem.</li>
    <li> I was always a sweaty dude before finding this deodorant - I can&#x27;t believe how many shirts I sweat through before I knew that this existed. It&#x27;s not very effective if you put it on in the morning not long after sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one gripe I have about it is that you can feel it on your skin which feels sticky whenever you touch your underarms even 12 hours after you apply it. It&#x27;s very hard to get off, even in the shower.</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry without leaving my armpits feeling dry</li>
    <li> My Father loves this stuff.  He became disables and then wheelchair bound so he is not able to take a shower whenever he wished but this product is great for keeping BO under control.</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant works very well and the smell is pretty good but mild and not overbearing. Goes all day and then some.</li>
    <li> feels clean and perfect</li>
    <li> Great protection and I love the smell. No under arm streaking or marks. Solid. I would buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette&#x27;s Clinical for years now, as it was one of the first ones on the market, and so far seems to be the best one for me. For a year, I was actually using prescription anti-antiperspirant, but that would some times cause discomfort/itchiness. Since this Dove stuff was on sale, and I use a few of their other products, I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is more powerful than other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, which some may prefer. But to me, it was a little too feminine. The strength of the anti-antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t seem quite as effective as Gillette either. Which, to some, may not make much of a difference. But to me, this stuff doesn&#x27;t keep me fully dry (even when just sitting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m not a big fan of the way the deodorant comes out of the canister. With Gillettes, it&#x27;s pretty simple: 3 clicks and you&#x27;ve got enough to apply. With this, it seems to be like 4 rotations...but the product only seems to come out of one side of the application area. The shape of the application area is a bit odd compared to most traditional containers. It still works, but it&#x27;s more of a flat circle than a nice curved/contour oval. For the price I got it at, it&#x27;s still worth it...but otherwise, at normal price, I&#x27;d prefer Gillette.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my menfolk. They need a strong product but I&#x27;m allergic to most scents. This does have an scent but is very mild and not perfumed.</li>
    <li> It is very funny the way you get the gel but it smells good and it protects me, SOOOO IT WORKS :D</li>
    <li> i usually got irritation from deo, this one said non irritant so thought might be a good idea to buy this one, but got irritation after using for couple of days. So i guess not for really non-irritant for everyone.</li>
    <li> Tried all the other &amp;#34;clinical deodorants&amp;#34; and this far outranks them all. Most of the others either have strong smells that are overwhelming or cause moderate irritation. I sweat a lot and this keeps things under great control</li>
    <li> Smells great, no irritation, but provides great anti-perspiring protection. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found a antiperspirant that can keep up with  me!  This is the only brand I buy now!</li>
    <li> This is a must for my husband, he wont use anything else. I keep it on subscribe and save so it gets delivered automatically.</li>
    <li> I just started using this antiperspirant yesterday after getting fed up with sweating through my shirts like crazy. Like many other reviewers, I have extremely sensitive skin and have been using a natural deodorant since everything else I&#x27;ve tried makes my armpits get red, peel, and HURT. But again, I figured I might as well give it a try and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using Dove, I tried using my boyfriend&#x27;s Old Spice since it was around. It did absolutely nothing for me. So, out of pure frustration, I decided to go as strong as I could. At the drug store, I found this product from Dove and figured I should give it a shot since it&#x27;s designed for sensitive skin and I use Dove&#x27;s sensitive skin soap already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some of it on in the car outside of the store (yeah, I know..), and promptly forgot all about it. After running some errands and instinctively hiding my armpit sweat marks, I realized I was totally dry. Not only that, but my armpits weren&#x27;t irritated at all. Now, after a couple days of using it, I&#x27;m wearing whatever shirts I want on warm days and not worrying about sweat showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a noticeable residue, but I&#x27;ll gladly trade that for the sweaty alternative. Again, it&#x27;s only been a couple days, but I&#x27;m very happy with the results so far and will try and update in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> My husband says this did not keep him dry. I cancelled my subscription.</li>
    <li> I have to suit up for work which can make commuting in the summer quite hot and uncomfortable.  This is by far the best deodorant/antiperspirant I have used.  It has a nice odor, goes on smoothly and I can&#x27;t think of a time that I would have underarm sweat while using it.  The only minor drawback is you&#x27;ve got to scrub quite a bit in the shower to get remove it from your underarms.  It is cheaper to purchase on Amazon (usually $10-$11 in stores in NYC), so I&#x27;ve just been using the subscription service.  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite deodorant &amp; antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried just about everything - go to your local superstore, and I&#x27;ve tried it. The Clinical Strength from other brands &#x27;work&#x27;, but leave my arms feeling tender or sticky. This stuff is easy, works all day (sometimes two), when so many other deodorants won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great product. This Antiperspirant works very well, pleasant scent and quick clear drying.  Good improvement.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
