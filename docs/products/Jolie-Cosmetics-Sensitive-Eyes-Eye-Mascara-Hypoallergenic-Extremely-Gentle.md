### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It also adds volume and length and has a great brush!</li>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>After reading all the great reviews, I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>I hope this information helps others that have greatly suffered from this eye disease even when not using eye make up.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>and I am thrilled to say it worked!</li>
      <li>It filled my needs perfectly.</li>
      <li>and this mascara is amazing.  </li>
      <li>It has been the best stuff I have used so far.  </li>
      <li>For more information on helping you with this disease I have, see my review on Blephasol  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m perfectly okay with that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not been able to wear mascara for some time because of irritation to my eyes.</li>
      <li>Great product, brush is good and doesn&#x27;t clump on long eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>washes off easily too</li>
      <li>I have worn it on about 6 occasions so far, and my eyes are still fine!!  </li>
      <li>It is so gentle, does not clump and comes off easily.  </li>
      <li>Not crazy about this doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing any at all</li>
      <li>Also, the reason I bought this was because my eyes have recently become very sensitive and allergic to many and most mascaras, however, this &amp;#34;sensitive eyes mascara&amp;#34; still itched me.</li>
      <li>After reading the great reviews, I decided to try the Sensitive Eyes brand and my eye twitch completely disappeared by the 2nd day of use.  </li>
      <li>I have conjunctivitis in my eyes, and I haven&#x27;t been able to wear mascara longer than a 30-minute period for the last 6 years.  </li>
      <li>People that suffer from Blephristis or Occula Rosacea know the additional irritation eye mascara can cause and especially when you then remove the makeup with hypoallergenic products brought easily for this purpose at drug stores.  </li>
      <li>and that really disappoints me.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t get much on</li>
      <li>This one really works for me, and I&#x27;m very thankful to find it.</li>
      <li>But I am really grateful to have it and recommend it very confidently to people with serious eye sensitivity.</li>
      <li>For the first time I have been able to wear eye makeup  using Anada Natural Mascara as well as cleaning my eyemake up with plain baby shampoo diluted.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes and lash line</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>Finally I tried this mascara, Sensitive Eyes, and it WORKED!!!!  </li>
      <li>Works very well and it is the first mascara I have ever used with absolutely no irritation.</li>
      <li>Not as much volume or length enhancement as I would like but at least I am itch free</li>
      <li>I was hoping this one would work, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>I also really appreciate the affordable price and will definitely continue to use it...</li>
      <li>I ended up giving it to my sister, since she needed some and doesn&#x27;t have sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>Instead of using gentle hypoallergenic eye makeup removers from the commonly purchased  brands in drug stores, I now just clean my eye makeup off with diluted baby shampoo</li>
      <li>This mascara Sensitive Eyes worked reasonably well but not completely did it prevent soreness and pain like Anada did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I had tried several big name brands that you can buy in any large store, no luck</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive eyes, and I&#x27;ve not yet found a colored mascara I could actually wear without irritation.</li>
      <li>and I find this not irritating as other makeup removers have been for me.</li>
      <li>Oh, and for the only mascaras that are labled hypoallergenic, the only one I have used to date is Anada Natural Mascara that has not irritated my eyes.  </li>

<li> I haven&#x27;t worn mascara for years due to problems with allergies but can use the sensitive eyes mascara with no problems at all.</li>
<li> I naturally have semi long lashes and this doesn&#x27;t not make them standout like previous mascaras have.</li>
<li> and I wear it every day all day long.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t dry well</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes and I have dry eyes with contacts.  </li>
<li> It is not thick and defining mascara like ones you find in the pharmacy, it is definitely a delicate look.  </li>
<li> Not even a single tear!</li>
<li> and then what little is there doesn&#x27;t last,</li>
<li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome which causes dry eye and other problems.</li>
<li> It defined my eyes with absolutely no irritation.</li>
<li> My eyes have been a constant source of trouble for me since 2012.</li>
<li> not a great mascara (didnt do much to lashes), and irritated my eyes.</li>
<li> When I did that before with other kinds of mascara I had big trouble.  </li>
<li> All other mascaras have cause puffiness and redness around the eye rims.  </li>
<li> I highly do not recommend this!!</li>
<li> My eyes tend to tear a bit throughout the day even w/out mascara due to allergies.  </li>
<li> After only an hour of use, the mascara got really dry and started coming off, getting in my eyes, and irritating them terribly, luckily, it only took a little bit of water to wash it off.</li>
<li> This is working really well for me - my eyelids haven&#x27;t been itching like crazy like they did with other products.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding a mascara</li>
<li> there is hardly anything in the tube and still flaked which caused my eyes to get irritated..</li>
<li> This mascara genuinely sucks.</li>
<li> the next morning I was so shocked because I didnt feel a thing at all.</li>
<li> This is not a good mascara..</li>
<li> This stuff is thick, gloopy, the applicator is terrible, it takes ages to dry, and it still makes my eyes itch.</li>
<li> This product might work for someone else, but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
<li> This is the worst mascara ever, it was so dry that I couldn&#x27;t even use it once</li>
<li> After developing an extremely annoying eye twitch, I wondered if it possibly was caused by the name brand mascara I was using that had a nasty chemical smell to it and wanted to try a hypoallergenic mascara.  </li>
<li> The application is impossible, as the product is thick and lumpy and awful.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s THAT bad.  </li>
<li> probably the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been searching for mascara that wouldn&#x27;t cause the skin around my eyes to become red and irritated, and now I&#x27;ve found it.  This one really works for me, and I&#x27;m very thankful to find it.</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews, I decided to give it a try. After only an hour of use, the mascara got really dry and started coming off, getting in my eyes, and irritating them terribly, luckily, it only took a little bit of water to wash it off. This product might work for someone else, but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive eyes, and I&#x27;ve not yet found a colored mascara I could actually wear without irritation. This stuff is thick, gloopy, the applicator is terrible, it takes ages to dry, and it still makes my eyes itch. I ended up giving it to my sister, since she needed some and doesn&#x27;t have sensitive eyes. I was hoping this one would work, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes. The application is impossible, as the product is thick and lumpy and awful.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes and I have dry eyes with contacts.  It has been the best stuff I have used so far.  Never a problem and I wear it every day all day long.</li>
    <li> Works very well and it is the first mascara I have ever used with absolutely no irritation.</li>
    <li> i have used it several times now and i don&#x27;t have any irritation. washes off easily too</li>
    <li> For the first time I have been able to wear eye makeup  using Anada Natural Mascara as well as cleaning my eyemake up with plain baby shampoo diluted.  This mascara Sensitive Eyes worked reasonably well but not completely did it prevent soreness and pain like Anada did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried about 40 plus products for Blepharitis that were cheaper that did not work like this one has for me that did not irritate my eyes before and after removing it.  People that suffer from Blephristis or Occula Rosacea know the additional irritation eye mascara can cause and especially when you then remove the makeup with hypoallergenic products brought easily for this purpose at drug stores.  Oh, and for the only mascaras that are labled hypoallergenic, the only one I have used to date is Anada Natural Mascara that has not irritated my eyes.  Instead of using gentle hypoallergenic eye makeup removers from the commonly purchased  brands in drug stores, I now just clean my eye makeup off with diluted baby shampoo and I find this not irritating as other makeup removers have been for me. For more information on helping you with this disease I have, see my review on Blephasol  I found this tip on  rosacea organization site.  If you want to have support for your rosacea/lblepharitis see rosacea-support.org on the web.  I hope this information helps others that have greatly suffered from this eye disease even when not using eye make up.</li>
    <li> probably the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Doesn&#x27;t dry well so you don&#x27;t get much on and then what little is there doesn&#x27;t last, ugh, I&#x27;d rather go without mascara!!</li>
    <li> Great product, brush is good and doesn&#x27;t clump on long eyelashes.  My eyes tend to tear a bit throughout the day even w/out mascara due to allergies.  Product does not run and does not provoke an allergic response.  Reordering my second.</li>
    <li> I have conjunctivitis in my eyes, and I haven&#x27;t been able to wear mascara longer than a 30-minute period for the last 6 years.  My eyes will swell shut- it&#x27;s THAT bad.  But I like to wear makeup, so I&#x27;ve been trying lots of different brands of mascara.  Maybelline, Almay, Cover Girl, Beuticontrol, Physicians Formula, etc.  Nothing worked for me.  Finally I tried this mascara, Sensitive Eyes, and it WORKED!!!!  I have worn it on about 6 occasions so far, and my eyes are still fine!!  I definitely recommend it for people who have allergic reactions to the standard mascaras.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn mascara for years due to problems with allergies but can use the sensitive eyes mascara with no problems at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding a mascara I&#x27;m not allergic to.  All other mascaras have cause puffiness and redness around the eye rims.  This one has not caused a reaction after about a month of use.  However, the performance/quality of the mascara is nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> It runs and for hypo allergenic, it reacts with my contact lenses</li>
    <li> Just keep ordering it over and over. Can&#x27;t stand anything else</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing any at all</li>
    <li> No irritation with this mascara. Not as much volume or length enhancement as I would like but at least I am itch free</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not been able to wear mascara for some time because of irritation to my eyes. I had tried several big name brands that you can buy in any large store, no luck I finally decided to try this and I am thrilled to say it worked! It defined my eyes with absolutely no irritation. Granted it doesn&#x27;t give you thicker, longer lashes but I&#x27;m perfectly okay with that. It filled my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works great. I have very sensitive eyes and this seems to be the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  No clumping</li>
    <li> This is the worst mascara ever, it was so dry that I couldn&#x27;t even use it once</li>
    <li> This is working really well for me - my eyelids haven&#x27;t been itching like crazy like they did with other products.</li>
    <li> This mascara genuinely sucks. I naturally have semi long lashes and this doesn&#x27;t not make them standout like previous mascaras have. Also, the reason I bought this was because my eyes have recently become very sensitive and allergic to many and most mascaras, however, this &amp;#34;sensitive eyes mascara&amp;#34; still itched me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I can even wear it during allergy season.&lt;br /&gt;good color black.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase it again</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me. not a great mascara (didnt do much to lashes), and irritated my eyes. I still haven&#x27;t found any eye makeup i can wear. I&#x27;ve tried this, Almay and Clinique. I finally gave up</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes and lash line and this mascara is amazing.  It is so gentle, does not clump and comes off easily.  It also adds volume and length and has a great brush!</li>
    <li> My eyes have been a constant source of trouble for me since 2012. I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome which causes dry eye and other problems. My osmolarity test numbers are 350s (if you know eye problems then you know what that means). I have tear duct plugs, use Restasis and  take fish oil and otc drops and steroid drops...So you get the idea. I have had to give up mascara entirely and that really disappoints me. UNTIL...I dared to try this mascara. No problems at all!  Not even a single tear! Once, I even forgot I had it on and went to sleep .When I saw it the next morning I was so shocked because I didnt feel a thing at all. When I did that before with other kinds of mascara I had big trouble.  It is not thick and defining mascara like ones you find in the pharmacy, it is definitely a delicate look.  But I am really grateful to have it and recommend it very confidently to people with serious eye sensitivity.</li>
    <li> This is not a good mascara..I used it twice and threw it out...there is hardly anything in the tube and still flaked which caused my eyes to get irritated..I highly do not recommend this!!</li>
    <li> After developing an extremely annoying eye twitch, I wondered if it possibly was caused by the name brand mascara I was using that had a nasty chemical smell to it and wanted to try a hypoallergenic mascara.  After reading the great reviews, I decided to try the Sensitive Eyes brand and my eye twitch completely disappeared by the 2nd day of use.  I also really appreciate the affordable price and will definitely continue to use it...</li>
