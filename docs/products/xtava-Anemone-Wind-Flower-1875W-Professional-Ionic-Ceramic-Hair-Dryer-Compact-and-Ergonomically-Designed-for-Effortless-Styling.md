      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten better as I&#x27;m getting used to it, though.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>She immediately suggested one of their dryers which would fit the diffuser, and offered me 20% off the purchase price!  </li>
      <li>It has made my hair softer, shinier, and significantly more manageable.  </li>
      <li>It is so much better than my Conair that I had.  </li>
      <li>Substantial and stylish.</li>
      <li>I Love it</li>
      <li>Pretty good dryer, lightweight and compact.</li>

      <li>It is easy to use and store.  </li>
      <li>This is such a amazing price for such a awesome hair dryer!!!</li>
      <li>I received this ionic ceramic hair dryer for the purposes of testing and reviewing, and overall, I think it is a great hair dryer, but not practical for extended use as its weight eventually puts a strain on the arm.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light weight</li>
      <li>It also is not very loud either when in use which is great</li>
      <li>Excited to receive and luv the weight of it.</li>
      <li>Love the temperature...does not blow too hot.</li>
      <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
      <li>It arrived in the original package but looked used.</li>
      <li>I wish I could take a picture,but the picture posted is exactly what it looks like:)</li>
      <li>and like you can clean out lint, etc to prolong the life.</li>
      <li>I love the colors of it, the blue and black are perfect for me since that is my favorite colors:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As long as this new one doesn&#x27;t do that, I will be happy!!</li>
      <li>Overall, this was a good hair dryer.</li>
      <li>the first one got pitched because the cord was becoming severed from the dryer...</li>
      <li>I love using the 2 concentrator nozzles they work well and really concentrate the air coming out when in use drying the hair faster.</li>
      <li>dryer comes with 2 removable concentrator nozzles, has 2 heat settings, 3 speed settings &amp; the Cool Shot setting.</li>
      <li>With the Wind Flower dryer I&#x27;m able to have a cooler temperature and impressively fast blowing</li>
      <li>The great thing about its size is that it is very portable and easy to transport, and for how small it is, it is extremely powerful and effective at quickly drying hair.</li>
      <li>I was lucky,</li>
      <li>is very pretty.</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of its design - the all-black with hints of blue is aesthetically appealing and fits in great at my mom&#x27;s beauty salon.</li>
      <li>(If you have thinner or shorter hair, it might be a good idea to dry your hair on the lower setting.)</li>
      <li>This is both an excellent and poor component of its design.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love that it offers the two heat settings and separate speeds.</li>
      <li>The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
      <li>I love how fast my hair dries with this dryer and the cord is very supple.  </li>
      <li>It was packed in a plastic bag in its box with the two nozzle attachments and when I first used it there was no bad smell or anything of the sort, which worried me</li>
      <li>It drys pretty fast in my opinion and leaves my hair smooth and frizzless.</li>
      <li>Very functional and strong hair dryer that looks sleek and stylish at the same time.</li>
      <li>dryer is very easy to use &amp; all of the settings are working properly.</li>
      <li>had been content with my old dryer, but I was incredibly surprised at how much better my hair now looks using the Anemone Wind Flower!  </li>
      <li>The controls are simple--low heat and high heat, gentle airstream and powerful airstream, and a cool shot button.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t put my finger on the exact odor, but it seems to be a combination of plastic and electric.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cute design, I have the blue flower.</li>
      <li>I love how the heat settings go from cool to hot and does not burn when using like other hair dryers I have used.</li>
      <li>This is a good buy on a solid dryer that should last for years.</li>
      <li>a hair dryer alone could make this much difference.  </li>
      <li>I really like the results from using Xtavas Anemone Blowdryer.</li>
      <li>This is a very efficient hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>Satisfied with the blow dryer however when the blower dryer arrived, it was poorly packaged and the dryer itself was full of dust?!?</li>
      <li>so it gets my hair dry pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Rather, it is more suited for only occasional use.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product, and this company.</li>
      <li>I recommend the product highly..</li>
      <li>This is high end quality.</li>
      <li>So far it has worked very well.</li>
      <li>Not spectacular, but nice design and performed well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:</li>
      <li>The color is gorgeous, I have the blue and black one and the blue pops out very nicely.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I questioned if it was new.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used pretty cheap ones in the past that made me feel like I was going to blow out an eardrum</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also pretty quiet for a blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get why people said its too heavy as it suits me just fine.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems, but they make it clear that if I do, they want to resolve them.</li>
      <li>I have just got this in and so far like it</li>
      <li>I also really like that this comes with two different diffusers, making it easier to achieve the style I want when drying my hair.</li>
      <li>The buttons are located on the handle and so far I have not switched the settings with my hand on it but may be a problem for others.</li>
      <li>For it&#x27;s size though, I was surprised by it&#x27;s power.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We received it and immediately noticed that it was not wrapped in plastic and came with no warranty,&lt;br /&gt;as soon as we plugged it in it smelled burned and one of the settings was not working...</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the blow dryer however when the blower dryer arrived, it was poorly packaged and the dryer itself was full of dust?!? I questioned if it was new. It honestly looked used.</li>
    <li> This is a very efficient hair dryer.  It is easy to use and store.  Although, as other reviewers stated, it is a bit on the heavy side, i don&#x27;t find that to be a deterrent.  I recommend the product highly..</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I have ever owned ! And sleek design . Love it</li>
    <li> I agree with the other comments- I love how compact it is but was very disappointed with how heavy it is. It arrived in the original package but looked used. The dryer was just thrown in there without additional packaging. It also has a strong burning smell when drying that maybe wears away with more use. Lastly, do not buy if you are a Lefty. Just holding it I was able to switch the settings while drying my hair:(</li>
    <li> I love the smaller size of this hair dryer, which makes it great for travel. At 1875w, it&#x27;s also still powerful enough to dry my medium-length, thick hair. (If you have thinner or shorter hair, it might be a good idea to dry your hair on the lower setting.) I also really like that this comes with two different diffusers, making it easier to achieve the style I want when drying my hair. This product was provided for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Pretty good dryer, lightweight and compact. I don&#x27;t get why people said its too heavy as it suits me just fine. The color is gorgeous, I have the blue and black one and the blue pops out very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also pretty quiet for a blow dryer. I&#x27;ve used pretty cheap ones in the past that made me feel like I was going to blow out an eardrum but this one isn&#x27;t like at all. It was packed in a plastic bag in its box with the two nozzle attachments and when I first used it there was no bad smell or anything of the sort, which worried me but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have that problem. Also didn&#x27;t take too long to dry my hair and my hair is very coiled and thick.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love that it offers the two heat settings and separate speeds. My old dryer only had one control and if you wanted high speed it meant you had to have hair frying temperatures along with it. With the Wind Flower dryer I&#x27;m able to have a cooler temperature and impressively fast blowing capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hard to dry hair and I can honestly say that I dried my hair faster than I ever have with other dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light weight so my arm didn&#x27;t get tired using it which is also great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this with a promotional discount however my reviews are honest and unbiased.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my mother and she loves it!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, however, I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks and there is an odor that was apparent when I opened it and has continued, although it has lessened some, until present. I can&#x27;t put my finger on the exact odor, but it seems to be a combination of plastic and electric. Hopefully this will subside as time goes on. Other than that (which is not an insignificant for me) it does dry well and I have no problem with the controls being in the way as others have suggested. It is not as lightweight as I expected. I have had several compliments on my hair lately so perhaps it is making a difference.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new dryer from Xtava...my previous ones were revlon (both the same model)...the first one got pitched because the cord was becoming severed from the dryer...the second because it started making a horrible noise and sparked at me!  As long as this new one doesn&#x27;t do that, I will be happy!! I hope it lasts a long time!  It&#x27;s a cute design, I have the blue flower.</li>
    <li> Love the temperature...does not blow too hot. Getting use to the button locations.</li>
    <li> Substantial and stylish. Works well.</li>
    <li> Excited to receive and luv the weight of it.</li>
    <li> This gets a 5+ star in my book.  I&#x27;ve used for a few weeks now and it dries my hair faster, smoother, and the 2 directional heads are perfect for directing the heat exactly where you want it to go.  It is so much better than my Conair that I had.  This is high end quality.</li>
    <li> The Anemone wind flower 1875 Blow dryer is amazing!!!  I Love it and so does the rest of my family. It has multiple heat speeds and a cold shot and trust me it gets cool , I put it on cold for me to feel and it was nice:) It dried my hair in a lot less time than most other blow dryers do and it comes with two removable nozzles so that you can dry your hair anyway you want to. I&#x27;m still stunned at how fast my hair dried. I have been through so many hair dryers and none of them came close to being this great!! I love the colors of it, the blue and black are perfect for me since that is my favorite colors:)&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair, not short so normally it really does take a lot of time to dry my hair. I&#x27;m in love with this blow dryer. I love that you have the choice of the colors, they are both really nice looking. This is such a amazing price for such a awesome hair dryer!!! I will end up buying another one just for my daughter to have,so she leaves mine alone:)&lt;br /&gt;I received this at little or at no cost to review and to give my unbias opinion and that is exactly what I have done. I wish I could take a picture,but the picture posted is exactly what it looks like:)</li>
    <li> Lightweight and efficient. This is a good buy on a solid dryer that should last for years.</li>
    <li> I love how fast my hair dries with this dryer and the cord is very supple.  But it has an industrial stink when I use it and it hasn&#x27;t diminished with use.  I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but I&#x27;m going to return it because it smells so bad.  It came loose in it&#x27;s box with it&#x27;s attachments instead of nicely packaged.  It makes me wonder how many people had it and returned it before me.</li>
    <li> I spent a little more on this than I usually do and I can already tell the difference. It&#x27;s a little heavy, but I assume that&#x27;s just because of better quality/more substantial parts. I&#x27;m hoping, anyway. Mostly, I&#x27;ve been very impressed with the company. I haven&#x27;t had any problems, but they make it clear that if I do, they want to resolve them. The only thing I would change is the location of the switches. I keep turning the heat down accidentally when I&#x27;m using it. I&#x27;ve gotten better as I&#x27;m getting used to it, though. I feel like this is going to last much longer than my last conair.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Nice weight and like you can clean out lint, etc to prolong the life. A good customer service company that also included styling dos and don&#x27;ts. Need all the help I can get 😜</li>
    <li> Very functional and strong hair dryer that looks sleek and stylish at the same time. I am a big fan of its design - the all-black with hints of blue is aesthetically appealing and fits in great at my mom&#x27;s beauty salon. The heat and speed settings are easy to switch between, and I especially like how cold the air from the cool shot button is. Great for styling and quickly attaining that shiny sheen to clients&#x27; hair. The concentrator nozzles that come with the hair dryer are also efficient for faster drying on days when we are tight on time.  Keep in mind that this hair dryer is compact and smaller than the typical hair dryer. This is both an excellent and poor component of its design. The great thing about its size is that it is very portable and easy to transport, and for how small it is, it is extremely powerful and effective at quickly drying hair. However, for its compact size, it is quite heavy, even heavier than the normal-sized blow dryer I previously purchased from this same brand, Xtava.  I received this ionic ceramic hair dryer for the purposes of testing and reviewing, and overall, I think it is a great hair dryer, but not practical for extended use as its weight eventually puts a strain on the arm. Rather, it is more suited for only occasional use.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was cute. It&#x27;s small and compact, fits into small spaces easily. Nice if you travel a lot. The weight wasn&#x27;t as light as what I would think for it&#x27;s size, but it wasn&#x27;t that heavy as some of the previous reviews said it was. For it&#x27;s size though, I was surprised by it&#x27;s power. It&#x27;s about the same as any one of my regular sized hair dryers and dried my hair just as well too. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about how this hair dryer was packaged. This hair dryer was loose in the box and there was no real protection. The dryer was easily thrown around in the box during shipment. I was lucky, though, my hair dryer was delivered with no damage. I also liked that there was two heat settings and three speed options. It also came with two removable attachment nozzles. There was a weird plastic smell the first few times I used it, but it went away eventually. Overall, this was a good hair dryer. Not spectacular, but nice design and performed well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.

    <li> I really like the results from using Xtavas Anemone Blowdryer.I have tried this on my hair and my daughters hair and it has left our hair with less frizz and a smoother finish.You have 2 speeds &amp; 3 heat settings.The buttons are located on the handle and so far I have not switched the settings with my hand on it but may be a problem for others.I was surprised that it had some weight to it for its compact size.I love how the heat settings go from cool to hot and does not burn when using like other hair dryers I have used.I love using the 2 concentrator nozzles they work well and really concentrate the air coming out when in use drying the hair faster.The cord is pretty long so I had plenty of room to move around.The power plug is a 2 flat prong with the standard reset buttons on it.This also has a cool power shot button on the handle under the nozzle and works great for setting your hair.So far it has worked very well.It drys pretty fast in my opinion and leaves my hair smooth and frizzless. It also is not very loud either when in use which is great and my toddler was not scared by the noise so that was a plus for me.Great to take on travel since it is compact.The one con is that their is a strong smell when using not sure how to explain it but there is definitely a smell from it.Not sure if t will go away with use.I have just got this in and so far like it so I am hoping this smell will go away.&lt;br /&gt;*Note: Sample provided to me for inspection purposes.</li>
    <li> This is a nice compact hair dryer. I like the looks of it &amp; the blue flower design is very pretty. It&#x27;s a bit heavier than I thought it would be for a dryer of this size, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.&lt;br /&gt;This dryer comes with 2 removable concentrator nozzles, has 2 heat settings, 3 speed settings &amp; the Cool Shot setting. It is 1875W so it gets my hair dry pretty quickly. I&#x27;ve not had the problem that others have had with a burning plastic smell.&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is very easy to use &amp; all of the settings are working properly. I&#x27;m very happy that I received this hair dryer for the purpose of testing &amp; review since my old hair dryer stopped working about a week ago! These opinions are based on my personal experience &amp; use of this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this hair dryer, and the Xtava customer service was absolutely wonderful.  I first purchased an Xtava diffuser, but it did not fit my 10-year old hair dryer.  So when the seller, one of the actual Xtava founders, emailed me for my feedback, I explained my situation.  She immediately suggested one of their dryers which would fit the diffuser, and offered me 20% off the purchase price!  After I discovered that Amazon was out of those specific dryers, I contacted her again, and she promptly extended the offer to this Anemone Wind Flower version, which I happened to prefer anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been content with my old dryer, but I was incredibly surprised at how much better my hair now looks using the Anemone Wind Flower!  It has made my hair softer, shinier, and significantly more manageable.  I had no idea a hair dryer alone could make this much difference.  The controls are simple--low heat and high heat, gentle airstream and powerful airstream, and a cool shot button.  Easy, lightweight, and effective.  I HIGHLY recommend this product, and this company.</li>
    <li> I love it ...very easy to use</li>
