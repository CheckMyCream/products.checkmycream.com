### Positive Reviews

      <li>I read about this product in a list of the 10 best beauty products of 2012</li>
      <li>, this used with something else will probably be your best bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Oh, and the sunscreen protection is excellent.</li>

      <li>These Neutrogena products are wonderful.</li>
      <li>Excellent moisturizer with SPF.</li>
      <li>Best there is and use it morning and</li>
      <li>Very good..</li>
      <li>Very good product and delivered on time.</li>
      <li>The stuff works great.</li>
      <li>This was a great lightweight moisturizer (oily skin) during the summer.</li>
      <li>Moisturizer is great.</li>
      <li>Smells nice but haven&#x27;t seen any real impressive results ...</li>
      <li>It is a great moisturizer</li>
      <li>Works great -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite happy with the product and will buy it again.</li>
      <li>This product was a great daytime moisterizer, however since I lost the bottle I am now stuck with paying $15 again to replace it.  </li>
      <li>Great product..</li>
      <li>I liked the fact that it has spf 30, but it might be best for oily skin.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m happy with the results</li>
      <li>Love this product!!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
      <li>The SPF factor is perfect for our South Texas coast killer sun, and the tone repair works better than anything else I have used.</li>
      <li>Hats-off to Neutrogena for formulating a superb product that has the results NOT obtained with the much more costly department store beauty products.</li>
      <li>I consider it a good moisturizer when I do not break out.</li>
      <li>It seems to help, I use all the Neutrogena products for repair and help with wrinkles and they all help and make my skin feel good</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m realizing that my skin looks really good.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good sunscreen, but it&#x27;s kinda oily even though it says it&#x27;s not.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m birracial with a fair complexion and have suffered from acne all my life.</li>
      <li>The good thing about these products is the price.</li>
      <li>I have had good luck with Neutrogena products before, so I bought it with Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Restoratives Anti-Oxidant Booster Serum, but after using them for 3 months, haven&#x27;t seen any improvements.  </li>
      <li>This product is basically a moisturizer with SPF 30, which it does provide with good results.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard Bed Bath &amp; Beyond carries it at a good price too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m switching to some of the anti-aging products recommended by Good Housekeeping.</li>
      <li>it has a really good sunscreen protector.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this during the day because it has a good amount of SPF to protect my face from damaging UV rays.</li>
      <li>I have somewhat oily skin, so if your skin is exceptionally oily, this product might trigger some shininess.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good but not as good and effective as the night version.</li>
      <li>Still love it  and will keep using it!</li>
      <li>am buying more!</li>
      <li>and it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>truly amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many face creams and none of them make my skin feel and look as good as this one does.</li>
      <li>Nice product,</li>
      <li>I bought the book &amp;#34;Clear for Life&amp;#34; and in it the author advises using an antioxidant moisturizer (the kind you&#x27;d find in a health food store).</li>
      <li>I liked the way it felt and it did seem to prevent breakouts</li>
      <li>This is a nice texture daytime moisturizing cream with SPF 30.  </li>
      <li>this product was great, it is exactly the product I was looking for for the price I was looking for...</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about a year and was glad to see I could order it on Amazon for less.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You will love the result</li>
      <li>A nice and smooth feeling on face and an added plus with the sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>I usually love Neutrogena</li>
      <li>Wife seems satisfied with the performance of the product</li>
      <li>I like to reduce the number of steps in my skincare regimen, especially in the morning, so having moisturizer, anti-aging, and suncreen all in one product is great!</li>
      <li>I really am glad I have tried this because I have tried so many and they did not give the results this product did.</li>
      <li>My skin is more even toned.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure.</li>
      <li>I notice that this Fall I have to use a lot more because my face is drier.  </li>
      <li>and that is why I said it is just ok.  </li>
      <li>/&gt; Love Neutrogena</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll fall in love with it too :)</li>
      <li>There is a gradual blending which I think is a more appropriate result.</li>
      <li>After trying many moisturizers I decided  to try Neutrogena.</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>and my brown spots did become more noticeable.</li>
      <li>not my favorite moisturizer.</li>
      <li>love neutrogena.</li>
      <li>so glad I listened to Dr. Oz &amp; tried a moisturizer with Vitamin C.</li>
      <li>Love that it has the spa 30.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use all three products and give these products more time to work on my face.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m immensely pleased &amp; won&#x27;t be switching brands anytime soon.</li>
      <li>This stuff cleared up my skin and made my skin so smooth!</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely moisturizer, I&#x27;ll give it that.  </li>
      <li>This product is ok for a sunscreen</li>
      <li>I use this and the Rapid Tone Moisturizer Night Cream and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
      <li>LOVE it.</li>
      <li>This had a very strong cheap perfume smell</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been great - it works well as a moisturizer under makeup, has a high SPF, and my skin looks smoother and clearer already</li>
      <li>Also I have dry / oily skin HAPPY SHOPPING!</li>
      <li>The Deep Wrinkle Repair bottle is also very good.</li>
      <li>Great and very smooth transaction, will definitely buy from again.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>I was really excited to get this because I love neutrogena products</li>
      <li>My skin will &amp;#34;clog&amp;#34; up easily</li>
      <li>This product brightened my skin and was so very mild.</li>
      <li>It feels great on my face -- keeps it hydrated, soft, smooth...</li>
      <li>I strongly suggest it.</li>
      <li>It is not a pleasing fragrance, but of disgustingly strong perfume.</li>
      <li>and I had to wash it off of my face as soon as I put it on because the smell gave me a strong allergic reaction.  </li>
      <li>well, the best way to great skin is to eat right, live clean,  exercise daily and get sound restful sleep.  </li>
      <li>This product works as well as the higher price ones and evens out skin tone nicely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my absolute favorite moisturizer!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well..was actually looking for the wrinkle repair moisturizer and ordered this by mistake but I do like it. It has evened  .  out any small skin tone differences in my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Moisterizes nicely, but other than this I&#x27;m not seeing a lot of difference in my skin tone.  I use this daily and keeps my skin hydrated all day.  Been using for about 3 weeks, maybe a little longer will show some tone repair.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes well and has spf which is a plus.  I am not sure I am seeing a lot of tone improvement yet.</li>
    <li> After trying many moisturizers I decided  to try Neutrogena. I&#x27;m 77 and have Rosacea. This product brightened my skin and was so very mild. Oh, and the sunscreen protection is excellent.</li>
    <li> Works well on my skin. Not pricey like other products that state the same results. I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena for years and can stand behind their products.</li>
    <li> I have really noticed a change in the tone of my skin. I have melasma and sun damage, and this seems to have made a big difference! The only issue is that I have really sensitive skin, and this can aggravate it if I use it exclusively. I use it 3-5 times a week and that has worked really well.</li>
    <li> Ouch!  This stings like crazy!</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  Save your money and go for Cerave.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for clearing up my skin I just use it for the SPF protection!</li>
    <li> A friend and I bought it and the results are noticeable!  There is a glow and texture to the skin that wasn&#x27;t there before.</li>
    <li> I suffer from acne scarring quite badly and thought this would be a good product - a moisturizer that also helps even your tone? Why not try it! After a few weeks, I definitely noticed a difference - I could go out without putting on foundation and not feel like I&#x27;m scaring the people around me. My overall tone was definitely more even... however, it didn&#x27;t do that much to the worst of my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something that will generally even your tone, this is definitely for you! If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;ll make a drastic change to the worst of your age spots/acne scars/freckles/etc., this used with something else will probably be your best bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was definitely satisfied enough with the result to continue using this product and even purchasing it again! However, after using up my second purchase of this product, my skin started to change a bit. I used to be super oily (PS - this product definitely isn&#x27;t greasy!), but then I had a really bad dry spell... which, of course, if you have oily skin, means your skin produces more oil to combat the dryness. It&#x27;s strange. But anyways, this product definitely did NOT provide enough moisture for my skin when this started happening. If you&#x27;ve got dry skin, I suggest using this with another moisturizer or just using the night version.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and the SPF keeps me from getting any sun and sun spots.</li>
    <li> Started using this about 2 1/2 weeks ago. I am 33 and have struggled with adult cystic acne on and off since my late teens. I started getting a bad spell that wouldn&#x27;t go away. I revamped my skin care and supplement routine. I bought the book &amp;#34;Clear for Life&amp;#34; and in it the author advises using an antioxidant moisturizer (the kind you&#x27;d find in a health food store). I couldn&#x27;t find one in so I bought this. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t spend $20 (at Walmart) on a little bottle of lotion but I was desperate to start getting my skin on the right track ASAP. At first I thought it was nice but didn&#x27;t notice anything dramatic. Now I&#x27;m realizing that my skin looks really good. I also put lemon juice on my face every night (which I highly recommend) and the spots are fading. Overall, my skin looks really good. I use this in the morning and it doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy, feels great going on, it&#x27;s actually soothing, and, even when I do get shiny it isn&#x27;t horrible shiny during the day - it&#x27;s kind of like a glow rather than icky oily large pores. I might continue spending $20 on this. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give it 5.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it does what it claims, but my face feels soft afterwards, and there is a tingly feeling that makes me think it&#x27;s doing something.</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL WITHIN TWO TO THREE DAYS. YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE USING IT FOR WHAT IT WORTH</li>
    <li> Smells nice but haven&#x27;t seen any real impressive results ...basically just has sunscreen ingredients in it...not terrible compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried but I am not purchasing again..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a month, I don&#x27;t see improvement</li>
    <li> Perfect for winter. Now I can use my neutrogena clear pore/ mask daily and then apply Rapid Tone after showering.  I feel moisturized and protected all day!!!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I use this during the day because it has a good amount of SPF to protect my face from damaging UV rays. It feels great on my face -- keeps it hydrated, soft, smooth...like baby&#x27;s skin! LOVE it. It&#x27;s my absolute favorite moisturizer! Buy it. You&#x27;ll fall in love with it too :)</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE! Product came in a unsealed box. Product was also not sealed. Immediately threw it away. Total waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Did not change anything!</li>
    <li> I am 24 and have suffered from acne since I was 12. I suffer from uneven texture and blotchy, scarred skin. This stuff cleared up my skin and made my skin so smooth! I strongly suggest it. At first it made me break out but as my skin got used to the new product it went away.</li>
    <li> A nice and smooth feeling on face and an added plus with the sunscreen.  Can not think of any other moisturizer I would  purchase.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I just got this product todayand used it just as little as 20 minutes ago along with my Queen Helene Mint Julep masque and Cetaphil face wash. Obviously my skin isn&#x27;t noticeably different after just minutes of using it, but I will say that the texture of it is AMAZING. It&#x27;s not oily at all, seems like a matte moisturizer, which is great because I wear foundation everyday I was using the Cetaphil moisturizer, which did nothing but make my skin all greasy and gross. It always looked like I was sweating with that stuff on. I did notice a red mark beneath my eye, I read a review that said your eyes will swell if you put it on them?!, I put it beneath my eye not on the eyelid, and beneath my brow bone where I had a dark spot. I really hope it doesn&#x27;t swell. Anyways, I workout 5 days out of the week and it is the begging of summer so anything matte will work wonders for me. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s advertised as a matte moisturizer but it certainly works like one. I have dark acne scars. I&#x27;m birracial with a fair complexion and have suffered from acne all my life. It does burn just a tiny bit but it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t handle. Will do an updated review after a couple weeks. If I like it I will be purchasing the nighttime version.</li>
    <li> Stinky. I have the night cream version of this and it smells amazing. The daytime spf version however smells so bad I had to wash my face after putting it on. Bummer. Will stick with the visibly even moisturizer with spf.</li>
    <li> I got this for an age spot on my left cheek. it seems to make it less pronounced but then one day in the sun with SPF 30 and it is there in full blown sight.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a year and was glad to see I could order it on Amazon for less.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it advertises. The vitamin C in it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Works great - I consider it a good moisturizer when I do not break out.</li>
    <li> Moisturizer is great. Makes skin feel smooth. Love that it has the spa 30.</li>
    <li> This did not make any difference for me.</li>
    <li> I started using this after using a well none big Department Store name that I have used since I was 16 And I find this brand works just as well The Moistrizer works just as well and the sunspots did not get any stronger when I started using Neutrogena I have waited over 8 months to write this review , so I could really see how well it worked Also I have dry / oily skin HAPPY SHOPPING!</li>
    <li> Use this each a.m. and hope it helps the dark spots.</li>
    <li> I only used the day cream. I liked the fact that it has spf 30, but it might be best for oily skin. I didn&#x27;t see the results I was looking for with my latina semi-dry skin. Mainly purchased it to brighten my skin that has turned dull over the years. But the drying effect turned me off to this product. I&#x27;m switching to some of the anti-aging products recommended by Good Housekeeping. Another Neutrogena cream was listed.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t expect fast results from any &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; product.  women will buy items wanting to believe what is advertised. well, the best way to great skin is to eat right, live clean,  exercise daily and get sound restful sleep.  Also, reduce the stress.  As for the product, I did like it, used it for several months, probably over 8, and I&#x27;m not sure I could tell anything was &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; or better.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very light but still offers a high SPF value.  My skin will &amp;#34;clog&amp;#34; up easily and this moisturizer seems to avoid that.  I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
    <li> Being someone who has been to the dermatologist to battle my melasma and dark spots, this is the First over the counter product that has actually worked! The spots are not gone but significantly faded to where you do not notice them after putting on my makeup. Fantastic! I tried Nerium for a month and it did nothing!! Nothing completely disappears without major dermatological help but this has done exactly what I wanted it to do. I also use their oil free moisturizer with SPF 35. Finally something that works! It took about 3 weeks to see results so hang in there and stay out of the sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many face creams and none of them make my skin feel and look as good as this one does.</li>
    <li> I have used this product every day for over a year, and my freckles are so much lighter than they used to be, even with moderate sun-exposure. It hasn&#x27;t made any noticeable difference in my dark circles under my eyes, though. Still love it  and will keep using it!</li>
    <li> These Neutrogena products are wonderful. The SPF factor is perfect for our South Texas coast killer sun, and the tone repair works better than anything else I have used. The Deep Wrinkle Repair bottle is also very good. They seem pricey, but this small bottle can last over a month if just using on your face and neck. I have used these products for over 5 years.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought Neutrogena products in about 10 yrs. Now that I&#x27;m getting older and have melisma I wanted something that would lighten the dark patches on my face. I have to tell you this stuff is great! After about 4-5 days I saw a difference on my forehead. This product does exactly what it says it will do. I only need to use a few dabs in the morning and it also has sunscreen in it. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has the dark patches.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase at Amazon, since I picked this up 5 days ago on a whim at Walgreens when my facial cleanser was drying out my face a bit and wanted something non-greasy for my skin.  After 5 days of use, I do have more even skin tone (just slightly), but my pores seem smaller, I always have 2-3 problem pimples at any given time on my chin. I think they were hormonal or from over oil production, since I use so many oil drying products trying to clear my face up.  I am 33 and had a few sun spots form in the last couple years and I had a few fine lines.  All are a bit diminished in just 5 days.  My skin just looks brighter and healthier.  I did not expect all of this when I just looking for a non-greasy moisturizer.  I love this stuff.  I like the smell too.  I just put it on after I clean my face in the shower.  I put it on at night after I wash for bed.  I have not had any dryness or peeling.  I was initially worried because it felt a little greasy in my tzone areas after application, but since using my face has gotten more clear, so I am okay if it is a little greasy, especially for those of you just applying at night.  Who cares.  The stuff works great.</li>
    <li> First of all, before you try a retinoid cream, DO YOUR RESEARCH ON WHAT TO EXPECT AND HOW THEY WORK!!! This is not an overnight miracle and your skin will go through an adjustment period of redness and flaking. I learned the hard way that it becomes more sensitive to other products and then you have increased stinging, flaking and redness as a result. So you have to be careful of the products you use with it.Also, if you have any blackheads beneath the surface of your skin, YOU WILL BREAK OUT. This is because the retinoid is &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; your skin. I really wish I had known this. Overall, I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks and I plan on sticking with it to see how it works in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. You also have to avoid facial waxing unless you want a layer of your skin coming off with the wax. Learned that the hard way too.</li>
    <li> Very good product and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> using every day brown spots still there</li>
    <li> Gentle skin exfoliant. Slight improvement in skin tone overall, but I use a glycolic acid product for brown spot reduction. That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but not as good and effective as the night version. However I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is easy to use and has a pleasant subtle scent. I noticed a differnce with 2 weeks and havent stopped using it since. I only wish it came in a bigger container.</li>
    <li> Really does diminish uneven tone, patchiness and minor scarring. Only complaint is the bottle is so small, you go through it rather quickly . It could be a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several months…I purchased it for its moisturizer capability.  While it is part of my normal skin care protocol, the merchandising language was different than the language on the side of the bottle.  The discrepancy is disturbing in that the use still is what I expected, but the marketing language implied more.  (Please see the comment for the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair,  SPF 30)</li>
    <li> I came up with all these rashes on my face and neck. It was horrible. Its quite an irony that I cleared the rash with another neutrogena product (neutrogena power scrub), which I have been using since I don&#x27;t even remember. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for any delicate skin. I&#x27;d return it if I could.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product was not compatible with my sensitive skin and the fragrance was too intense.</li>
    <li> Nice and soothing, and helps moisturize your face, and make it feel soft.  I like this product.</li>
    <li> I have dry, acne-prone skin that&#x27;s hard to manage without medication, but after a couple of months, this lotion is giving me some hope. I can&#x27;t tell if my scars are fading faster, but my skin feels smoother and breakouts are smaller and less common. Plus, there&#x27;s SPF, vitamin c, and retinol, so I&#x27;m overjoyed about getting them all in one lotion. I&#x27;m going to stick to this lotion for a long time.</li>
    <li> Works well I&#x27;ve used every day and my face has cleared of dark spots considerably the bottle isn&#x27;t that big and it won&#x27;t last more than a month or so but I&#x27;m happy with the results ( I bought both the night and day formulas)</li>
    <li> I am using this product (Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer SPF 30) during the day, alternating with Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, SPF 30 during the day also and using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night at night. After more than two weeks (the ad claims one week), I see some improvement but nothing to jump up and down. I will continue to use all three products and give these products more time to work on my face. I will report back after one month. The good thing about these products is the price. They are reasonable to buy all three. I will report back after one month. At this point, I give three stars.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product with a little going a long way!  It is a bit expensive but worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Very good..There is a gradual blending which I think is a more appropriate result.</li>
    <li> I was a little bit reluctant before I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and freckles because of the sun. This cream is perfect. it&#x27;s not oily, it definetly do it&#x27;s work reparing your tone. In just a few days my skin tone looked so much even. And my skin was soft.&lt;br /&gt;And it has a really good sunscreen protector.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product a short while and was amazed at the results.  My skin is more even toned.  I am noticing the dark spots are a little lighter.  My skin flaked a little but I&#x27;m sure this will go away in time as my skin is sensitive.  I really am glad I have tried this because I have tried so many and they did not give the results this product did.</li>
    <li> Have used this every morning and night for 1-1/2 months and have not noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a week now, after purchasing it to use as a basic daily moisturizer with SPF. I didn&#x27;t expect much, but it&#x27;s done a really nice job of brightening and smoothing out my face in a short amount of time. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it has dramatically faded all of my dark spots and old scars, but the overall effect has been pretty satisfying. I have somewhat oily skin, so if your skin is exceptionally oily, this product might trigger some shininess.</li>
    <li> Wife seems satisfied with the performance of the product</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using this product since I had used a similar one by Neutrogena and was very pleased with it.  This had a very strong cheap perfume smell and I had to wash it off of my face as soon as I put it on because the smell gave me a strong allergic reaction.  It is not a pleasing fragrance, but of disgustingly strong perfume. Perhaps the product works, but I will never know since I had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> This product is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it daily for two months on one large dark spot that had developed on my cheek from the sun, and it&#x27;s virtually gone!  I am so excited, and have recommended this product to friends.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work for me, but just know that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a dark brown complexion with a lot of hyper-pigmentation, and although this product made my face really smooth, it did nothing to my skin tone or dark marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first bottle (which lasted me a month using it ever night before i went to sleep, and using a sunscreen in the morning) and had no improvement. I then bought a second bottle as the first one was running out hoping I just needed to stick to it longer for it to work, but sadly, still no skin tone/dark mark improvement after 2 consistent months of nightly use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again, and i recommend if one bottle doesn&#x27;t give you results, don&#x27;t buy again or you&#x27;ll probably just be wasting your money on something that doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> Have used for years and wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
    <li> Love it... tho the price is a little to high, it is worth it if you want to keep a fresh appearance.</li>
    <li> Great product.. You will love the result</li>
    <li> I break out from all spf except this one. Even pricey ones don&#x27;t work for me.  This one is sheer, thin, but quite effective.  It&#x27;s a staple!!!!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena is one of my favorite drug store brands, and I use their cleansers religiously, so I had high hopes for this product.  Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations.  It&#x27;s a lovely moisturizer, I&#x27;ll give it that.  However, it had no effect at all on my skin tone.  I&#x27;m going back to my regular moisturizer.  :(</li>
    <li> I was looking for a BB cream that had high SPF but was light enough for my complexion (even the lightest colors are all to tan/orange on me).  This product was next to all the BB creams, so I decided to try it.  I&#x27;ve got extremely light skin and adult acne, which seems to have gotten much worse over the last few months.  When I looked at this product, it seemed like it might help fade the old, red acne scars and prevent future sun damage at the same time (I&#x27;ve also got a large sun spot under my left eye).  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and noticed that not only was it helping to fade the acne scars but it also seemed to be helping the current acne heal a little faster.  The change was slight, but noticeable.  So, I decided to buy the rapid tone repair night cream, too.  The use of these two products on a daily basis is really speeding along the fading of my red, acne scars (using it for 2 weeks now), and I seem to be getting far fewer new zits.  I&#x27;m also using a salicylic acid toner after I wash my face (gentle, also by neutrogena).  Instead of BB cream, I&#x27;ve defaulted to this daytime product with Aveno&#x27;s tinted moisturizer (also w/SPF) over the top of it, and this combination of products seems to be working very well for me.</li>
    <li> I normally do not do this but this product is just so fantastic that I had to. If you are on the fence and you&#x27;re wondering if you should waste your time and money well let me tell you ..DO IT ! You will not regret it. I am a 35 year old African American woman who started suffering with acne 2 years ago due to my birth control and thought my case was hopeless and I should just invest in cover up makeup, I was wrong wrong wrong! Not only has this product COMPLETELY stopped my acne - it started fading my dark spot within a week..yes a week. I am about 3 weeks in using this product  and I can not wait until the summer where I can go makeup less and not feel self conscious about my face.  I would give this product 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> love neutrogena. not my favorite moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use the product twice a day. My black spot seems fading away alittle bit, however, please do not put around eyes, it will cause probelm. My eyes are swolen the day after I accidentally put.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this as I don&#x27;t like my skin tone and have tried stuff that was $60+ that was supposed to help even skin tone and just didn&#x27;t work.  Usually products with SPF in it make my face break out.  My biggest surprise is that I don&#x27;t seem to be breaking out from it.  I like that it does have SPF in it that I can actually use.  As for evening out skin tone, I do think that after about 3 weeks I am seeing an improvement in my overall skin tone, however, it is not doing anything for the few dark sun spots that I have.  I am giving it 5 stars though because I can use it and have some SPF coverage on my face, and it is working at improving my overall skin tone better than the expensive lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product for skin tone repair to help with scars from years of acne.  This product is basically a moisturizer with SPF 30, which it does provide with good results.  The back of the bottle even states \\&quot;Purpose - Sunscreen\\&quot;.  I have been using it for about a month and have not noticed any tone results.  Going to try another product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually seen an improvement in the overall appearance of my face.  The hyper-pigmentation on  my forehead and cheeks have faded but it is a slow process.  My pores look smaller and the texture of my skin has become softer with continuous use.  The cream goes on effortlessly and is quickly absorbed without a lot of rubbing.  I like the light fragrance which isn&#x27;t too over powering and once applied it fades quickly. The SPF is a bonus too! Overall, I really like this product and have just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I usually love Neutrogena but this did nothing for me.  The cream was oily and didn&#x27;t absorb.  The bottle felt heavy but there was very little product in there.</li>
    <li> I highly recommed this product. My pores are smaller and skin is brighter I&#x27;m 36 year old hispanic tanned skin complexion and I now have this sun tanned glow during  this winter weather that I love!&lt;br /&gt; Love Neutrogena</li>
    <li> I had bought this locally and tried it.  I like how it goes on so smoothly and not sticky.  The service provided in sending me this product was  excellent.</li>
    <li> Two days after I had used this product, I got pimples on my face and stopped using it entirely. This product has not worked for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is easily absorbed into my skin, has no perfume smell, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and my skin has improved since I began using it.  I get it on Prime subscription and I will continue to use it as my primary facial moisturizer.  I do use a C/Hyaluronic serum beforehand. During the colder months, I also use a small drop or two of Rose Hip Seed Oil for additional skin protection.  I am 64 and have absolutely no wrinkles (not including laugh lines around my eyes when I smile.)</li>
    <li> I have never bought any Neutrogena product that disapointed me. This wasn&#x27;t different. Your skin is much smoother after the first user.</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd bottle and I do see my sun spots fading, but it&#x27;s not fast enough.  So, if you want fast results this is not for you.</li>
    <li> When you buy neutrogena,you buy quality</li>
    <li> I like to reduce the number of steps in my skincare regimen, especially in the morning, so having moisturizer, anti-aging, and suncreen all in one product is great! And it&#x27;s not expensive like all the Sephora stuff I used to buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really just a sun block, and I didn&#x27;t see anything about repairing tones. I have had good luck with Neutrogena products before, so I bought it with Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Restoratives Anti-Oxidant Booster Serum, but after using them for 3 months, haven&#x27;t seen any improvements.  I read the back of the container, and found that it&#x27;s really just a sun block.  &amp;#34;Tone Repair&amp;#34; is misleading.</li>
    <li> This was a great lightweight moisturizer (oily skin) during the summer. I notice that this Fall I have to use a lot more because my face is drier.  I may have to switch to a different moisturizer this season.</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer SPF 30 is a very nice daily moisturizer.  I just tend to be a bit sensative to a lot of the sunscreens, which is not the fault of this product.  I can wear this every other day with no problem.  I just use the night version of this which has no sunscreen on the other days.&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is not tinted, which I like, and is not too heavy but does a decent job of moisturizing.  I&#x27;m quite happy with the product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This really works -BUT it takes Time. Stick with it and make concentrated applications&lt;br /&gt; to the dark spot you&#x27;re targeting.&lt;br /&gt;I am buying more!</li>
    <li> works well for my skin, not too oily.</li>
    <li> Best there is and use it morning and night-skin looks smoother and wrinkles are much less noticeable</li>
    <li> Great and very smooth transaction, will definitely buy from again.&lt;br /&gt;Does exactly as advertised, no greasy residue and reduces lines</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of a daytime retinol/moisturizer and was looking at trying Philosophy&#x27;s new \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; version ($48) or PTR&#x27;s daytime retinol ($78). Then I came across a review for this as the best multitasker, and decided that at less than half the price, it was worth a try. It&#x27;s been great - it works well as a moisturizer under makeup, has a high SPF, and my skin looks smoother and clearer already (it&#x27;s only been a week). I will say I get a little, minor tingling with it, but I think it is because I am sensitive to chemical sunscreens, not the retinol. Anyway, I love it and think it measures up to those more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says - evens tone and results are quickly noticeable.  Smooth even toned skin.  Excellent moisturizer with SPF. I use the night time version also - a dynamic duo!</li>
    <li> Made my skin burn and become red, especially under my eyes... Made the area under my eyes look like I was punched in the face.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good sunscreen, but it&#x27;s kinda oily even though it says it&#x27;s not.  no improvement in skin tone after a few months of use.  price also went up.  will not buy again</li>
    <li> I had very dull and blotchy skin.  After using the Rapid Tone repair moisturizer for a couple of weeks, complete strangers on the street have complemented me on my complexion, they have all found it hard to believe that I&#x27;m 80!  Love this product!!</li>
    <li> This product does fade brownspots and evens out skin tone. I did stop using it  and my brown spots did become more noticeable. I started up again when I found it on Amazon. The store I previously bought it was always out of stock. It is a great moisturizer and I wear this under my foundation but wait about 5 minuites before appling foundation.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a year.  Can&#x27;t say that it does anything for brown spots but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on.</li>
    <li> I liked the way it felt and it did seem to prevent breakouts but I really wanted it to help with age spots.  I went through two daytime bottles and two night time bottles, using as directed.  It may have helped with wrinkles a little but the spots are still there.  :-(</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you whether this works or not, because I could only tolerate the smell for a few days. It has that typical skincare-with-sunscreen smell, which I do not like. Theoretically it should work, but I recommend ELTA MD Clear SPF 46 instead, as it has a significant dose of skin-brightening Niacinamide, doesn&#x27;t smell, and provides reliable broad spectrum sun protection.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over a week now and my skin is very dry and flaky..</li>
    <li> wow. wrinkles, acne, acne scars and dark spots, this stuff is helping with all of it. truly amazing. way worth it!</li>
    <li> I had a horrible problem with acne that followed me to adult years. I had ugly blackheads left over after bumps went away from prescription medicines. I thought that they would never go away. I used this product and it is a miracle wonder. Within exactly 4 weeks my face was cleared of blackheads and is still clear after months after use. I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I use both the Day &amp; Nighttime moisturizer. This is probably one of the best anti-aging products I&#x27;ve ever tried. It worked immediately, showing visible results in the first week. I really noticed the difference in the texture of my skin right away &amp; over time my pores have refined &amp; become smaller. I feel like I look more youthful &amp; radiant overall &amp; my results keep improving the longer I use it. Basically it does everything they promised (&amp; how often does that happen?)I&#x27;m so glad I listened to Dr. Oz &amp; tried a moisturizer with Vitamin C. I&#x27;m immensely pleased &amp; won&#x27;t be switching brands anytime soon.</li>
    <li> This is a nice texture daytime moisturizing cream with SPF 30.  I have trouble wearing ANY cream on my face (get too hot), but can wear this one if the temp doesn&#x27;t rise too much.  Is $23.98 at my local CVS store, unless on sale, and even then not this low a price.  I&#x27;ve heard Bed Bath &amp; Beyond carries it at a good price too.</li>
    <li> Up until now, I thought all moisturizers were pretty much the same, but I was wrong!  This stuff is amazing!  I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a month and can see a remarkable difference in all the dark spots on my face - they have faded dramatically!  It is a light cream that goes on and stays on well under make-up.  I use this cream during the day and then the night cream at night. I heartily recommend this!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this because I love neutrogena products and I know first hand that this works! But when it came today (an hour ago) it came broken. The spring was out and the cap was busted and it was opened within the packaging. So everyday I have to take off the wand and rub it on my face. Kindda pisses me off.</li>
    <li> I use this alone when outside for longer times. It feels lightweight on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.</li>
    <li> Expected more from this.  I generally like Neutrogena--love their facial cleansing cloths--but this had oily feel to it and just an ok smell.  Didn&#x27;t notice a difference in skin tone after weeks of use.  I am early 30s with fair skin and minor sun damage, so I thought I&#x27;d try some more affordable products before shelling out the dough for something of supposed higher quality.</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizer, not too light, not too heavy.  I appreciate that it comes with SPF 30.  But I can&#x27;t say that after 3 months I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in my brown spots.</li>
    <li> I could notice a difference in just a couple of weeks.  I read about this product in a list of the 10 best beauty products of 2012 so I decided to give it a try.  I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is ok for a sunscreen but it you are looking for it to repair age spots or other skin issues, Its worthless for that. My wife and I used this for over a month and all it does is act as a sunscreen. Repairs nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy something else if you want a skin repair!!1</li>
    <li> It works as advertised , it does work on dark areas of the skin to blend in to the surrounding areas , definitely an item that I would recommend to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Worked on my temperamental sensitive skin.  Good daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Really like this product and the price. There are other products on the market that lighten dark areas but the price can be high. This product works as well as the higher price ones and evens out skin tone nicely. I&#x27;m a forever customer</li>
    <li> I am no stranger to facial treatments and expensive cosmetic products--I&#x27;ve been in the business! Hats-off to Neutrogena for formulating a superb product that has the results NOT obtained with the much more costly department store beauty products. &amp;#34;Stand-back Lauder&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer absolutely works. I am in my mid-twenties with regular to oily skin and was looking for a daily moisturizer with SPF that didn&#x27;t contribute to my oiliness.  The fact that this moisturizer repairs the dark inconsistencies in my skin tone is an added bonus.  I use this and the Rapid Tone Moisturizer Night Cream and my skin has never looked better.  The only downside to this is the bottle runs out quicker than expected.  All of the sudden one day I was out, and only then did I realize that the bottle was made of glass and makes the bottle feel fuller than it actually is.</li>
    <li> No noticeable results within a week, like the ad states. This is just another moisturizer that is over priced. o&#x27;well</li>
    <li> This product has worked very well for me.  I purchased this rapid tone repair moisturizer because I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve noticed increasingly pigmented areas on my face; blotchy patches from sun over exposure.  This moisturizer from Neutrogena is one of the only broad spectrum moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. Combined use with the Night Rapid Toner has improved the texture of my skin and has done an excellent job at evening my skin tone.  I can still see some darker blotchiness, but these patches have definitely lightened since I started usage (1 month ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way too! I was worried I would run of 1oz of moisturizer quickly but I believe this will last me at least three months more!</li>
    <li> I have sun spots on my hands and a large spot on my face from a breakout. After using Rapid Tone Repair for a month I have seen no&lt;br /&gt;appreciable difference either on my hands or my face.</li>
    <li> I Tried this product for a week as described, It seen like it burn my skin in  certain areas of my face. I&#x27;m not for sure if it removing dead skin or a reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angel -Chicago IL</li>
    <li> this product was great, it is exactly the product I was looking for for the price I was looking for...</li>
    <li> This product was a great daytime moisterizer, however since I lost the bottle I am now stuck with paying $15 again to replace it.  I really appreciate the SPF and my face did start to see small differences in the tone, but could not use long enough to give a full review.</li>
    <li> Nice product, but I think it may have caused my skin to break out and that is why I said it is just ok.  I would not be quick to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I guess it is no worse than other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I may have ordered the wrong product.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the word requirements for commenting on products.</li>
    <li> I really like Neutrogena products. I use this one everyday along with the Rapid Wrinkle Repair. They leave my skin as smooth and even as it can be.</li>
    <li> It seems to help, I use all the Neutrogena products for repair and help with wrinkles and they all help and make my skin feel good</li>
</ol>
