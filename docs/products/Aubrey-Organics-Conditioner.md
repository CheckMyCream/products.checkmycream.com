<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Life saver for my hair.  I had so much breakage previously and this helped.  Just wish it came in a 32 oz bottle. I can go through this 16 oz bottle in 3 washings.</li>
    <li> : I need a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the shampoo, but at the same time makes my hair feel silky and softer. I only use natural products, this is the first natural conditioner I ever got, and I&#x27;m sticking to it.</li>
    <li> Its ok. No big difference from other conditioners. I would do a little more research on other products on the market.</li>
    <li> Started using this in Las Vegas along with the matching shampoo - great for the dry desert weather, hair lost the dryness, was always bouncy and soft. Vendor is one I have used for many other items. Love the 0.99 shipping, particularly attractive if I am buying one or two items.  Vendor is very prompt, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Vitaminshoppe.</li>
    <li> STINKS.initially. I thought this is what &amp;#34;jail&amp;#34; shampoo would smell like. I am starting to like the balsam(?) scent now. I have used conditioner that costs twice this price and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling as clean and soft (it is shiny too). I will buy this conditioner as long as its available. By the way my hair type is coarse.</li>
    <li> I have short curly hair, rather dry. The product did make my hair very soft, almost too soft. After using my hair felt limp and sort of mushy. I really wanted to like this product, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aubrey&#x27;s stuff for thirty years, not anymore. They have changed the formula for nearly all their products, it seems: weird smells &amp; not same the quality. Really too bad. They seem to have sold-out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry, this is a good conditioner, but it&#x27;s not worth paying over $15 a bottle for when LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AGO it was about $12.37 for the same 16 oz. bottle on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because a read a review online that said if you loved Aveda Deep Penetrating conditioner and were sad that they discontinued it to try this.  The only negative comments I found was that the smell lingered.  When I first tried this I thought it was going to be great.  However after only using this 2 times as a deep conditioning teatment my hair started to break off.  I do have colored and bleached hair and just recently noticed my hair was looking dry so I was looking for a conditioner that would help that.  This seemed to work but all of a sudden I noticed the breakage and nothing changed except me using this product.  Now I am on the search for something that will work.  And now not only does my hair look dry but is also broken off.  I would not recommend...</li>
    <li> I started using this because I had pretty bad eczema and wanted to eliminate harsh chemicals from shampoo and conditioner.  My eczema cleared up as soon as I started using this conditioner in combination with Aubrey Primrose and Lavendar scalp soothing shampoo, but my hair started coming out in handfuls.  Sadly, I had healthy hair that I was trying to grow long, but this product and the Aubrey shampoo basically thinned and ruined it.</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner that actually worked on my dry, kinky, natural black hair.  I have spent years trying to find something like this.  I used top of the line products that were much more expensive (Aveda/Nioxin/Nexxus to name a few).  They just sat on my hair left me thirsty for moisture.  With Aubrey Organics GPB you notice the difference immediately.  It leaves my hair soft and super moisturized-- something I was beginning to think my hair couldn&#x27;t do.  It is now my staple conditioner.  I always use it as a deep conditioner on \\&quot;dry hair\\&quot;.  Because of this I wash (really deep condition-co-wash) my hair more often; and I actually look forward to washing.  I believe this is my first review; this stuff is that good.  Side note, It helps my hair hold water better; and I use it as a leave in mixture, too.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews more carefully before ordering. The smell of this product lingers for days, and is way too strong. My husband says that it makes him sick. We are going to throw it out, and maybe call them to report. The product did condition my hair OK.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is awesome and I love it! I first saw this product on a blog site and started reseaching it since it seemed like something worth a try. Since I ordered this product I have used it everytime I wash my hair as my conditioner and it works. I had damage to my hair from bleaching it and it was also try and looked dull. This product has revived my curls, given my hair body and shine and it even feels stronger. I also love that its all natural. I would highly recommed this product to all curly girls and also if your hair is dry and damaged from bleaching. This is now a staple product for me.</li>
    <li> Personally, I love this product.  I have been using it for about 10 years and have strayed away only once.  I am an African American woman with waistlength, thick, soft, cottony-textured texlaxed/texturized/relaxed hair and I started using this product as a bone straight relaxed head.  My hair is not naturally coarse, as a lot of people automatically think about AA hair.  After going natural in 2002, I continued use of the product as it worked on my chemically treated and natural hair.  After years of being natural, I kept using it, about once every 2 months with no problems.  As of 2009, I am relaxed again and am still using this product.  It never fails in helping give my hair that extra boost of strength and shine.  I love the smell and the natural ingredients.  I will probably start buying the 16oz bottle instead of 11oz, because of my longer hair.  In my opinion, the milk protein in the product is a great alternative to all of these hard protein treatments out there like Aphogee.  Try it, I think you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> A lot of people complain about this product, saying it&#x27;s not the same as it use to be / not as good as it use to be,,,, that it made their hair dry and break and stuff. But I guess everybody&#x27;s hair is different and therefore reacts differently to different products because I love this stuff. MY HAIR TEXTURE: I am black with curly/kinky hair that needs a lot of moisture. It curls up when moisturized correctly. Otherwise it&#x27;ll just be dry and tangled.  I wear it straight during Fall, Winter, and half of Spring.  I wear it natural (no heat) all Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it since around November 2014 (Winter: wearing my hair straight). I wash my hair with Jane Carter Solution shampoo (thinking about switching to something else) and then I use this conditioner.  I do this every other week.  Immediately after I rinse it out (I leave it in for about 5 to 7 min), my hair feels unusually super soft and strong.  After I rinse it, I gently towel dry it a little bit and then put additional moisturizer in it (a concoction I mixed together myself) and then i blow dry it.  My hair feels stronger than normal for about the next 3 days,,,, I guess because the product is still in there and takes a while to completely go away.  Even though this is a protein conditioner, they did a good job of making it very moisturizing as well.  I love it.  But I do understand that everybody&#x27;s hair is different so you never know until you try it. As far as the smell, I like that too.  Smells good to me :)</li>
    <li> This is my hands-down most favorite conditioner. It&#x27;s a deep conditioner that leaves my hair so soft. If I use it every day my hair gets too limp, but as a deeper conditioner 1-2 times/week, it&#x27;s amazing! My daughters have very textured, coarse hair, and this conditioner leaves it noticeably softer and easier to comb. Highly recommend. This is has been one of my favorite products for 20+ years.</li>
    <li> this is the best conditioner i have ever used.  the smell is wonderful!!!  unlike any other scent used by popular brands.  it&#x27;s all natural and leaves hair shiny, soft, and smooth.  it&#x27;s expensive but is the best out there!</li>
    <li> I love this. Well, I pretty much love ALL Aubrey Organics conditioners (not so much their shampoos, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this does have a bit of an odd, strong odor, it&#x27;s not too bad. I combine this conditioners with olive oil in a separate little bottle and after mixing and sitting together, the smell lessens a bit, plus there&#x27;s the added moisturizer of the olive oil. Also, I make sure to rinse very well after the conditioner sets in my hair. After blow drying, the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all. And honestly, a little bit of an odd but not horrible smell in exchange for healthy, hydrated hair isn&#x27;t so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the bottle I have runs out, I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I got this to try out a natural conditioner and I&#x27;m fairly pleased with it. It&#x27;s very creamy and smells very flowery and pleasant. It distributed fairly easily and left my hair strong and healthy. The only real downsides are that my hair got consistently more tangled when I used this conditioner and it really didn&#x27;t last long for the money you&#x27;re paying. You could probably find a better conditioner out there, but this one will do you just fine.</li>
    <li> I use it to deep condition, it is really great on my hair and i just love the smell</li>
    <li> Excellent product, not like any other conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t feel slippery even in our very soft water.  I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down but still gives good conditioning results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently transitioning from relaxed to natural and I ran into this product.  Now of course I read all of the reviews and decided I would give it a shot.  The one thing that I kept reading in the reviews was that this product had a strong odor.  To my surprise it reminded me of my favorite perfume Dolce &amp; Gabbana: The One.  So if you don&#x27;t like that perfume don&#x27;t buy this product.  Otherwise give it a try.  It&#x27;s all natural; I can&#x27;t say I have seen any results yet as I have just begun using it but I hope to see some soon.</li>
    <li> My hair was so dry and brittle but after I used this I noticed right away how soft my hair felt. I also believe is helped with breakage. I usually put this on after pre-pooing and I will leave it on for about half a day and rinse out. Awesome!</li>
    <li> Most of the reviews here date back to BEFORE  the company changed all their products. Yes, this once WAS an outstanding product, praised by many customers.  It is no longer available, because the company has changed the formulas of all their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement products are just &amp;#34;so-so&amp;#34; conditioners in fancier bottles. Nothing special to differentiate them all the other product out there.  (The picture of the product shown here has not been updated to show the new packaging and labels.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this is a good company that made a big mistake when trying to capture more of the &amp;#34;mass market&amp;#34;, and they are no longer selling the products in the formulas that worked so well.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking the original GPB hair conditioner, this is not it, so do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Smells like an old lady but works good. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, porous and prone to frizzing. This is a light protein conditioner that can be used on a regular basis to lay the cuticle flat and seal in moisture. love this stuff especially on humid summer days.</li>
    <li> omg this is beautiful and good, it makes my hair soft and manageable shine. its weightless, love it love it</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s more telling than anything about this product is that one of my kids used it for her natural hair and left the top off. The product spilled on to my shower tiles and didn&#x27;t get washed off immediately because we had to dash out. When I came home that night, this product hardened into a thick paste and I had a hard time getting it off with normal cleaning products! I actually had to use a butter knife to scrape it off and still couldn&#x27;t get all of it off! I tried leaving cleaning product on it for an hour to soften it some. It came off but with a lot of hard-work on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product did that to my bathroom tiles, then I don&#x27;t care what the product claims are on the bottle or what any YouTube vlogger says about it, I don&#x27;t want it on my hair or my family&#x27;s hair. This means that the product probably doesn&#x27;t wash all the way out of your hair and the residue leaves your hair hard and dry - which means eventual breakage. Imagine what it does to someone with fine hair, color treated, or fragile hair. Awful.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen anything soo particular about this product.  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s soo expensive... Even being organic. $8 is enough for this.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing anymore because of the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural cruelty free conditioner and forund it! I love hw it feels on my scalp. The fragrance is delightful. It is hard to detangle though, not a good slip at all. So I oil rinse then detangle. All this conditioner has to offer is completely absorbed. I see instant results in how well my hair holds moisture. I will try the Honeysuckle next.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner.  This protein conditioner tames my 4a/4b hair, leaving it soft and manageable.  Has quickly risen to the top of the list as one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> My hair requires something a little more intense as far as protein treatments. I think it may work for some. Just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4A/3C texture, extremely active lifestyle (sports &amp; weather exposure)</li>
    <li> I really like Aubrey Organics Blue-Green Algae anything, so I thought I would give this a try. The odor is overwhelming. It smells like super sweet baby powder, but 100 times as strong.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deep conditioner.  It has a great smell and a cooling effect on your scalp.  It&#x27;s very, very thick and hard to squeeze out of the cap.  I usually end up unscrewing the cap to squeeze the product out.  Not being able to use the cap would be my only dislike about the packaging but not the product.  I think this would benefit more from a pump or jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes my hair feel incredibly soft.  My curls are springy and my scalp feels clean.  I don&#x27;t use shampoo except for once a month but I deep condition weekly and this is a great deep conditioner for I&#x27;m sure any kind of hair.  I also love that it&#x27;s organic.  Grea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I guess I don&#x27;t agree with protein hair treatments. They just make my hair feel like slippery straw, like it won&#x27;t wash out...I don&#x27;t know I just really don&#x27;t like it. Also, it didn&#x27;t get rid of any of my scalp/dermatitis issues. I got the Jason dandruff shampoo and it took all my problems away.</li>
    <li> This stuff can be diluted quite a bit! Very nice quality from a good company. Aubrey avoids nasty chemicals, and I don&#x27;t ever see myself using other products with these folks around.</li>
    <li> I added a little baking soda to some and just found my mew fav no-poo product ever.  Loved it!  I follow up with the honeysuckle rose for moisture.</li>
    <li> I love this product. If I don&#x27;t use it for a while my hair breaks. So I give this two thumbs up. Keeps my strands strong and healthy.</li>
    <li> Great Product for smooth skin !!</li>
    <li> Please please please bring back the old formula.  This product in its original formula was wonderful for kinky curly African-American hair.  Kept it strong detangled and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in 2014 this formula scares me actually.  My first concern is about the smell.  What in the world is that strong smell?  The original formula had a unique herbal like smell.  This new smell smells like bathroom cleaner.  Bleach.  The consistency is different too.  It&#x27;s thinner.  Really guys????  Why change what wasn&#x27;t broken?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in fairness I am going to test this product a few times and come back with an update on how it has handled my natural kinky African-American hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Its great for any hair type. I enjoy the scent and the benefits. I use this biweekly for deep conditioning. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> Smelled funny - suspect counterfit product. I have bought this before and it did not have the odor it did this time.</li>
    <li> I gave this several tries, but I have not been satisfied yet. The list of ingredients on Amazon are incorrect, because it forgets to mention that the second ingredients are NOT natural, but alcohols. It has two alcohols before any of the natural ingredients, and they are drying. I put this conditioner on my ends and it does not even have the consistency of a conditioner (organic or not), it glides on as if I have placed chemicals onto my hair. It smells like a chemical and it feels like a chemical. The minute I rinse my hair out, it is noticeable that this conditioner does not even attempt to condition your hair. It is an overall disappointment, and I wish I could get my money back. Does nothing, made my hair feel dry and frizzy, and is not a natural product when it contains more drying alcohols then any other ingredient... so it should not claim to be one.</li>
    <li> I have long natural corkscrew locks and made the mistake to bleach my dark hair blonde. Unfortunately my hair dried out, feels like straw and the locks are gone. I&#x27;ve tried many different conditioners in the past, naturals, and many of them have been making my hair smooth, but didn&#x27;t bring my corkscrew locks back. Finally found Aubrey Organics GPB and my corkscrews are back after only one use, better than ever before. My hair feels so soft and smells so incredibly good, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this conditioner. If you have really frizzy hair through coloring, that conditioner is for you. It doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume, but fresh and natural. And I still smell it very strongly after a whole day being outside and sweating. Great product; I am a permanent customer for this one now. Also, it is the only one that I found so far that is completely paraben free.</li>
    <li> Great light protein treatment. Here is my full review:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vULKGa2AjwI&amp;list&#x3D;PLCT7rEmj0Xky6XuOXgit_biwollZj4HXI&amp;index&#x3D;30</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I saw a lot of great reviews on it for a while now and I just needed to see if this is the deep conditioner for me and is! It really does make a great DC after I used it it left my hair really soft and it felt hydrated. Because I don&#x27;t have a hair dryer I left the conditioner in my hair for about an hour or two under a plastic shower cap and towel and my hair felt like new when I washed it out I might do an over night thing next time and see. But I recommend this to any hair type!</li>
    <li> The smell is awesome. It is a rich product. Great for detangling. Truly a good protein conditioner. My hair type is a 4a. So ladies give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointment.</li>
    <li> I use this once a month when my hair needs extra tender loving care.  I don&#x27;t too much protein for my fine thin tresses.  I also like Aubrey Organics Conditioners.  Very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LMR - Georgia</li>
    <li> Horrible smell!!! Terrible consistency, doesn&#x27;t help at all, leaves hair greasy and limp and as I have thin hair it just looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair...I really had wanted to like it but it was awful!!!</li>
    <li> I love this deep conditioner-protein treatment. I use it once each month to make my hair strong and healthy</li>
    <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars is because last night was the first time I ever used this product. I&#x27;ve heard such great things about it so I had to try it. I used it on my ends to deep condition the &amp;#34;old hair&amp;#34; and it feels really nice. I like the idea of this product being organic. Over time, I will be able to tell how well the product works. I&#x27;m not too excited about the texture of it though. It reminds me of Noxzema. The smell of it is pleasant but the look reminds me of the jar of Noxzema I used to use. But that could be because its organic. But I&#x27;m excited about seeing the results over time. *fingers crossed</li>
    <li> good product for protein treatment</li>
    <li> My curly hair seems to really like it.  The ingredients and the bottle are different, but they&#x27;re still respectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are actually: Aqua, cetyl alcohol, alcohol denat., aloe barbadensis leaf juice, wheat germ oil, fragrance (from essential oils), glycerin, milk protein, brassica campestris/aleurites fordi oil copolymer, grapefruit extract, sage oil, vitamin c, glycine soja oil, rosemary leaf oil, castor oil, vitamin e, glycoprotein, beta-carotene, carrot root extract, horsetail extract, coltsfoot leaf extract, nettle extract.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;I am an African american female with natural hair, long before the natural hair craze. It was always dry and brittle. I started co washing etc about a year ago. I was shedding hair like crazy, even to the touch, for months. I thought I was thinning so I bout thinning products. I was actually over conditioning my hair. This product was recommended for my hair problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the difference immediately.  While washing and conditioning,  there was less than half of the usual amount of hair on the shower floor. When twisting, my hair was much lighter, more volume and NO SHEDDING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to try not to style my hair very often and use my fingers as a comb  because of the shedding. No more of that! I comb and style with nothing on the floor and just strands in the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU AUDREY!</li>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner for thick dry/coarse hair. Keeps hair strong and manageable. Been using this product now for 2 years. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, the product does have a strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger after washing it out. I recommend this product to anybody.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a review on Naturally Nikki. I have about six conditioners I rotate through. The weeks I&#x27;m unable to deep condition (overnight with coconut oil / two hour yogurt treatment) I turn to this conditioner. It&#x27;s the only one where I really see less breakage (when I don&#x27;t deep condition). I say this is a strengthening treatment and not a conditioning / softening treatment. My hair is 4b/4c and very fine.</li>
    <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t quite do what I hoped it would for my hair. Some days it feels dryer than others. I dont use styling products or hot hair equipment on my hair. Was hoping it would smooth my hair more.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found Aubrey products. I ordered this along with Aubrey Chamomile Hydrating Shampoo and love them both. This conditioner is thick, smells good and leaves my very long hair silky, smooth, soft and smelling clean and fresh. My main reason for ordering Aubrey products is because they are Natural and/or organic. I am trying to avoid sulfates and dyes due to allergies. See my other review for Aubrey Shampoo for more details.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I just wanted to add that I just reordered and realized that my 1st bottle lasted me 2 months! I&#x27;m still loving it too!</li>
    <li> A pretty good conditoner, especially considering it&#x27;s all natural. It took a while for my hair to adjust to all natural shampoo and conditioner, but after a couple of months it did finally adjust, and I&#x27;ve found that the Aubrey Organics line of conditioners does a good job of actually detangling my hair, which most all natural conditioners can&#x27;t seem to do.  My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t like the smell. It&#x27;s not pretty or feminine smelling. It doesn&#x27;t have a nice flora or yummy food scent. It smells very masculine. Fortunately the smell doesn&#x27;t linger too long after rinsing it out.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I notice an improvement over regular &amp;#34;non-natural&amp;#34; conditioner, but it gets the job does and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like bad motel hair conditioner. We&#x27;re on our third or so bottle and haven&#x27;t had a problem with it. The price could be better though. I&#x27;m still going to look into other options.</li>
    <li> I love ALL aubrey organics products and this is one of my favorites. This conditioner has done wonders for my super dry, heat damaged, naturally curly hair. I live in Wisconsin and the winter here makes my hair so dry, however after using this conditioner, my hair is moisturized, shiny and bouncy, NO more static. Despite a couple bad reviews about the smell, I LOVE the smell! It smells very fresh and natural. I also love that the ingredients are completely natural. You know exactly what you are putting on your hair and skin. It is a little pricy however I only wash my hair every other day at minimum and I only use a dime size amount of conditioner so it does last a long time. I highly recommend this product along with all other aubrey products, especially their loose powder, lip balm and gloss.</li>
    <li> The packaging is updated and the fragrance seems Off.  I have been using this conditioner for over 30 years and I always go back to it. The scent makes me feel like I am walking in a forest. Great product just prefer the older scent.</li>
    <li> Thank you lord for this stuff. For real. The best deep conditioner I tried &amp; this is the only one I tried. I don&#x27;t think any other deep conditioner can make me as happy as this one! It&#x27;s amazing. Go look at my review on YouTube! youtube.com/BADGiRLJORDAN :)</li>
    <li> Helped my hair to grow thicker and longer</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!.....I was looking for a protein conditioner and this was perfect!. It has all natural ingredients and smells nice! I have relaxed hair and needed a protein that wasn&#x27;t too harsh, but would do the job.</li>
    <li> Formula has changed.  The smell is too strong.  Washed my hair immediately after, so I don&#x27;t know if it is any good as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this conditioner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to give some strength to my weak strands, and after reading all the raving reviews,  I decided to try this product. I tried it on dry hair and immediately felt the difference after rinsing. My strands felt thicker and stronger. I would most definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> favorite conditioner ever.  leaves hair strong and soft.  used as a child and still using as a 31 yr old adult.  love, love, love.  I also love the smell.</li>
    <li> my curls was so shiny this is a really amazing product and you dont need that much to get a great deep condition</li>
    <li> The jury is still out on this one. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my hair. Maybe it is doing something beyond what the eyes can see. It&#x27;s rather pricey.</li>
    <li> This rescued my dry damaged hair from falling out to healthy, vibrant hair. Thank you CurlyNikki for recommending this, because after coloring my hair a few times &amp; doing protein treatments with another product that I thought was helping (it actually made my hair dramatically worse), it has truly saved my locks.  Worked wonders on my varied texture hair (3a-3c hair).</li>
    <li> I have been using Biolage for quite some time now, but as is bound to happen in past experiences...my hair &amp;#34;gets used&amp;#34; to a product and stops responding as when I first discovered it!  Fortunately, I just discovered this lovely conditioner!  It is definitely my new favorite and I hope my hair never &amp;#34;gets used&amp;#34; to it so that I can use it all the time FOREVER!  The way it softens and conditions is absolutely fabulous and I can&#x27;t begin to explain the beautiful smell!  When I was putting it on my damp hair I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work since it wasn&#x27;t heavy and greasy like I&#x27;m used to feeling when I put conditioner on my hair...instead, it is smooth and creamy (smells wonderful too) and when applied to my hair I really had to work it in and smooth it to the ends...it took a little effort but as I was pulling it toward the ends it became easier and easier and actually coated my hair very nicely.  I waited about 4 minutes and rinsed.  The rinse was a pleasant surprise since it was easy to remove from my hair without rinsing and rinsing and rinsing!  I could tell it didn&#x27;t leave a residue but felt soft and swingy.  Since I have naturally curly, frizzy hair I rinse with a cold rinse to seal the cuticle and stop the frizz as my hair dries.  This method worked very well with this conditioner...excellent results!  Just a little note:  I did precede the conditioner with the Aubrey Swimmer&#x27;s Shampoo (non-lathering...no sulphates)...this works best for my silver-grey hair to keep it silvery and beautiful!  I am a very happy lady with the Aubrey products I&#x27;m now using!</li>
    <li> Finally I have found a solution to decades of itchy, flaky scalp.  This conditioner along with the primrose and lavender shampoo.  Magnificent.</li>
    <li> Within the last year, I have been trying to clean up my beauty product routine. I have been switching to more natural products both with my hair regime and my face regime. I found a wonderful website for references, www.GoodGuide.com and that is how I stumbled upon Aubrey Organics. It was highly rated on the site as healthy, environmentally, and societally safe. It was also not astronomically out of my price range so I thought, why not, I will give it a go. I use this conditioner with the Aubrey Organics Camomile Luxurious Volumizing Shampoo (what happened to be available on Amazon Prime) and I must say, it is certainly different from using a cheap brand such as Herbal Essences or Pantene Pro-V which I was switching between. I used this combination for about 3 months or so and the bottles are probably about half full still (I also only have shoulder length hair). They have lasted a good while and that is great to know considering that you are paying more for the product. However, with a higher price tag usually comes a better product and I must say Aubrey Organics does deliver. I love that they have natural products and nothing that is harmful to you or your hair. If you would like to find out how the shampoo worked for me, you can look my review up; in this one I would like to just address the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the Aubrey Organics conditioner. It is a little harder to work through the hair after washing with their shampoo (see my review for details) and this is why I give it 4 stars. However, if I start from the ends and carefully work my way up while getting the tangles out, I can usually work the conditioner in without it being too painful. After washing the conditioner out, my hair doesn&#x27;t get that \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; or silky feeling like it would with a traditional shampoo/conditioner combo, but I am okay with that now because of the results it has given me. After allowing my hair to dry in a towel for a few minutes, I usually just let it air dry the rest of the way. My hair is less frizzy, is shiny, silky, and much more tame. I can DEFINITELY see the difference between my use with Aubrey Organics and other cheap brands. The difference is insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love Aubrey Organics. Because this is my first time ever trying a natural product in the shower, I am new to how it feels. It does take a little getting used to because they don&#x27;t \\&quot;sud\\&quot; up in the shower and it makes it slightly difficult to wash while in the shower, but once you are out, there is no issue. It is easy to comb through if needed, but I like just letting it air dry to reveal my natural waves. It&#x27;s incredible what a difference this shampoo/conditioner combo has made. I would highly recommend Aubrey Organics to anyone who is looking for natural products. They are affordable (especially for organic) and do wonders for your hair; give them a try!he rest of the way.
