      <li>So soft :)</li>
      <li>I LOVE these brushes so far.</li>
      <li>Love the bristles and since I have sensitive skin, this has worked well with my skin.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money, worth probably even 4 times what I paid for it.</li>

      <li>They super soft and doesn&#x27;t shed when I  apply my makeup on.</li>
      <li>but these were easy to work with and sturdy even a couple of washes later.</li>
      <li>The angled brush is also very versatile as it can be used to do brows or gel liner, and even make a cutthroat cut crease.</li>
      <li>Its very convenient for a fast face and eye look.</li>
      <li>I think these 4 items are all you&#x27;ll really need if you&#x27;re on the go ..one for eye shadow, another for eyebrows or eye liner, and then the kabuki for foundation or powder.</li>
      <li>Blends my liquid foundation really well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>

    <li> These brushes are great! So soft :)</li>
    <li> This color I love purple! They are very nice. Just what I wanted. Very soft onto my skin</li>
    <li> This is such a cute makeup brush set! I especially love the kabuki foundation brush. It helps evenly apply my liquid foundation and blends it perfectly into my skin. I&#x27;ve washed these brushes a few times since I purchased them, and none of them shed. I love the white and gold handles. They look super elegant and do a great job in blending makeup. I received these brushes at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. In my opinion, if you&#x27;re looking for a starter makeup brush set, you definitely need to give this a try! You&#x27;ll love the quality of these brushes!</li>

    <li> Love the brushes. They super soft and doesn&#x27;t shed when I  apply my makeup on. Professional looking and quality. I would recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> Bought the original pink Chevron set last year and absolutely loved it so decided to pick up this kabuki set.  Absolutely love it.  Amazing value, worth way more.  Takes me 1/2 the time it used to apply my foundation.  Brushes are so soft.  Finally happy to not have to use my hands to wash my brushes as well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes!! They work GREAT and brushes on softly. My baby had accidentally thrown it in my washer and it came out clean and still in great condition hahah!</li>
    <li> Very soft! I am new to makeup,  but these brushes make it easy for me. They are full and hold a lot of powder. Very soft and works great with my bare minerals makeup.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes so far. They are soft and seem to be of very good quality. They do not feel hard or synthetic as so many other brushes do. I also love the larger mascara wand. I use it to separate my lashes after applying mascara and also use it to comb my eyebrows out after putting makeup on them. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> These are very nice brushes.  I like the soft bristles and the fact that they haven&#x27;t shed on me.  I even like the brush cleaner, so clever.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really soft and very sturdy I&#x27;m loving my new set.</li>
    <li> Soft as a baby butt!!  Love the bristles and since I have sensitive skin, this has worked well with my skin.  No irritation, so far so good.  The quality is really good.</li>
    <li> First off I bought these on my husbands account lol. I absolutely love everything about this kit. I opened them up and tried them all. The foundation flat brush is perfect. I only needed two pumps of foundation and it covered my face evenly. I have a brush I bought for $45 and it takes at least 6 pumps and leaves lines. The blending brush is also amazing. Well worth the money, worth probably even 4 times what I paid for it. You definitely have a life long customer with me.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really tuff and it makes it hard to put your makeup on.</li>
    <li> Super Soft brushes they are amazing :)</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set of brushes for a fraction of the cost of others :) I have the original Chevron set and was intrigued by the kabuki brush included in this set. Plus, I like to use more than one color around my water line so it&#x27;s nice to have 2 angled brushes.

Over-all, pretty great set.</li>
    <li> Im seriously loving this this set. Its very convenient for a fast face and eye look. The blending brush is everything!!!! As a makeup artist a blending brush is key to a flawless look. And this is it. The angled brush is also very versatile as it can be used to do brows or gel liner, and even make a cutthroat cut crease. ;) this is seriously the best set ever. !!! Im in love. Altair never seems to fail me. 💜💜💜💋💋</li>
    <li> The brush bristles are seriously so soft! Shipping was extremely fast!</li>
    <li> I got this because a wonderful woman who I follow on instagram @michelle04974 advertised it for a wicked good price. I got it super fast, the brushes are as good as promised. I am very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> These brushes are ultra soft, non shedding, great quality, and precise. The price is great!!! The Kabuki evenly applied my full coverage CC cream from IT cosmetics, the thickest foundation I own. I am very satisfied and would definitely recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and work well! I use them everyday with no problems!</li>
    <li> Very pretty - soft brushes-love the blending bush awesome deal a must for any make up wearer ❤️</li>
    <li> it is my first 4pcs, but I know that I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes!!! I always wash my brushes as soon as I get them and I expect some bristles to come off like they normally do, but not these. I used Whip Hand Cosmetics Brush shampoo in Maile, so not only are these brushes super soft, they smell good too! I have very sensitive skin, cheaply made brushes cause red blotting on my face, NO PROBLEM this far with these brushes. I will definitely be getting more!</li>
