<li> It was not the right shade that I ordered and the make up was lose and torn up it was not a good product</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a chalky dry powder look, instead leaves a foundation appearance (with the ease of a powder application).  </li>
<li> about every other month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have used this for a few years now and will continue to!</li>
<li> like how well it covers everything, and although it is heavy for a powder it isn&#x27;t heavy as a foundation itself, oil bases are worse.</li>
<li> Hard to find this product in stores.  </li>

    <li> Awesome product. Will definitely purchase more.</li>
    <li> Perfect price and does the job!!</li>
    <li> Everything I thought it would be</li>
    <li> This powder is really good in my opinion. I love it. It&#x27;s really good for setting my liquid foundation on my face.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin  and multiple allergies and was told by my doctor I could use this product. I broke out in a severe  rash.  My doctor theorized it was because  a change in formula / or an unlisted ingredient. Either way I need to buy products at a store that will accept returns.</li>
    <li> This is a very good cover-up, blends right into the skin and covers any blemishes very well. The pad that is included is very nice and soft as well.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this product in stores.  I ordered a supply so I could quit looking for it.  I think Cover Girl is discontinuing this product.</li>
    <li> This makeup offers wonderful coverage.  It has a nice texture and looks so smooth and frest on the skin.  Haven&#x27;t found anything that comes close.</li>
    <li> Great price, the powder came a little beat up, the packaging was ripped up</li>
    <li> It was not the right shade that I ordered and the make up was lose and torn up it was not a good product</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t even get the color I wanted..</li>
    <li> I love CoverGirl products, but I also love some other major and minor brands so I&#x27;m not being brand bias. I enjoy this, it was given to me as a gift from my aunt (she has more money then a 20 something who just opened a business that demands time and money, movies are expensive to make LOL) and I get it each time she comes to visit, about every other month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how well it covers everything, and although it is heavy for a powder it isn&#x27;t heavy as a foundation itself, oil bases are worse.</li>
