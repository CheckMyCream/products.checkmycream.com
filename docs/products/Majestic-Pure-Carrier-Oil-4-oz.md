<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is literally for EVERYTHING.... Recently I was going to buy some fungus treatment but didn&#x27;t want to shovel out all that money. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t. I got everything I need in one bottle. For my sunburns, acne marks, toe fungus and my daughters  eczema. It is oily but of course, it&#x27;s an oil!! Has a slight smell not over powering though. My daughter says it smells like play doh. I think between that and a little lite coffee or something. I don&#x27;t know had to explain but very calm sent. I&#x27;m glad I got this because I know I will use it to the fullest. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed this at a promo price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. Used for massage on my feet and legs and it is relaxing and makes my legs feel like silk. Even better than when I get pedis. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;added 6/17/15&lt;br /&gt;My roommate has been using this oil on a sore that wasn&#x27;t healing on the back of her hand. Two days and it is almost gone!!! This product is amazing. She is diabetic.</li>
    <li> I have recurring flaky dermatitis on the palms of my hands that has left them cracked and bleeding. I&#x27;ve tried the most expensive hand treatments available along with moisturizing gloves, exfoliants and a myriad of anything else I thought would help my condition.&lt;br /&gt;I received this oil 4 days ago and began treating my palms a few times a day with it.&lt;br /&gt;I swear this oil is a miracle. I have never had anything act so quickly or thoroughly to heal the disgusting, flaky, peeling, cracked skin on my palms. I&#x27;ll be using it elsewhere and updating this review accordingly!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real thing. Fast improvement in acne scars and eyelid eczema. I have grown to even like the smell.</li>
    <li> I have some pretty unsightly scars on my stomach due to surgery.  I&#x27;ve been using tamanu oil religiously on it for a while and I can tell a difference in how the scars look.  It seems to have diminished how prominent they are.  They are by no means gone completely but they are much lighter than they used to be.  I&#x27;ve also been using this on some age spots and they are now lighter than they were before and that&#x27;s a win for me! I received a promotional discount on this product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Using this oil in my hair. It feels amazing. The smell is bearable.</li>
    <li> Tamanu oil is fairly new to me. I know it helps to promote formulation of new tissue. It has a scent which I can best describe as soap like. It&#x27;s bit thicker than other essential oils, and has more of a green hue to it. Could compare it to an unprocessed olive oil. This oil has really helped with my dry cracked elbows. To cut the scent I add a drop of lemon essential oil. Over all I like it, but it&#x27;s a bit thick for me.</li>
    <li> I think this Tamanu Oil smells like figs.  It really did give off that Fresh wild Fig aroma to me, which is good. I like it.  I put a few drops in my Aromatherapy diffuser to see if the smell in the vapor would help with the burnt garlic bread scent that was lingering in my apartment from earlier, and It really did help me with that.  I like how thick Majestic Pure Extra Tamanu Oil is.  I am building up my Oil Collection and this one is just nice to have.  I like that it helped change the atmosphere in my house.  I received product at discount for my opinion.</li>
    <li> Tamanu Oil is a great product, at this size and price a great value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to post my review after seeing results. Well it&#x27;s been two weeks and I suffer from a Acne scar on my chest and I&#x27;ve tried so many products over the years and I must say the TAMANU OIL is a must have. I had a little thinning hair around my edges and I use it on my scalp. My hair is growing in much thicker. If I were you I&#x27;d purchase in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Just made a soap using this. I know a lot of people who have skin problems &amp; this is for healing skin. Can&#x27;t wait to get my reviews on them. I have four different people who try things for me, so I know when it&#x27;s really great or just good. I&#x27;ll let you&#x27;ll know when I get my feed back.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using tamanu oil. I have been using it for a couple weeks now on a couple of scars I have. So far they have lightened up a bit. I have been reading that Tamanu oil is good for skin regeneration and lightening scars which is why I started using it. The product was packaged well and came with a glass dropper. I&#x27;ve seen this oil sell for a lot more so this is a great price to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I love how versatile this oil is! There are just so many different things to use this tamanu oil for. I just so happened to get a silly pimple after I received it and wanted to see how well this works since one of the things it&#x27;s good for is acne. I rubbed a little bit on the pimple twice that day and then when I woke up the next day the size of the pimple,the redness,and the pain were all pretty much nonexistent! I&#x27;m usually one of those people who can&#x27;t stand having pimples so I try and pop them as soon as I see it; yes I know it&#x27;s not good for your skin. However with this Tamanu oil I won&#x27;t have to do that to my skin anymore and will be able to just put this on and see a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it helps with wounds as I tend to be a little clumsy. It also helps with bug bites which I think is amazing since there are so many mosquitoes here in Oklahoma and it never fells that I&#x27;m always the first one to get bit so I can&#x27;t wait to be able to combat the itchiness with this Tamanu oil! I would definitely recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> I have been adding a few drops of this to my moisturizer, morning and night and it seems to a lovely product...  My skin loves oil and this one is working well!  I also use it when I do a deep conditioning on my hair...  Great product!</li>
    <li> good product very happy with it</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from hand eczema for over a year now.  This is one of the only products that just instantly calms my hands and stops the itch. I use it full strength.</li>
    <li> I have a VERY sensitive nose and some of the other oils I have used in the past have smelled just awful. This stuff smells great. There are so many different uses for it. I use it to help with acne problems and to help scars appear less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin and want to use this as part of a beauty regime I suggest testing it on a small area as it is very potent. You can always mix the oil with another oil such as coconut to bring down the potency. I use it on my entire body after a shower and it makes my skin feel great, look great and makes it super smooth.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t opened or tried this product, however I am quite upset with how it came to me. The dropper that came with the oil was broken, and the other pieces weren&#x27;t in the box either, which leads me to believe it was broke before it was even shipped to me. Not a big deal, I have disposable pipettes, but still was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Smells strong but at least I know I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;getting the real thing.  It has helped&lt;br /&gt;heal my son&#x27;s diaper rash in as little&lt;br /&gt;2 days with only one application.&lt;br /&gt;It is not sticky or thick like traditional&lt;br /&gt;daiper rash creams so it is easier to&lt;br /&gt;apply.  It&#x27;s hydrating properties help&lt;br /&gt;keep the skin moist and supple.  I&lt;br /&gt;find that it mixes well with coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;for a deeper more medicinal effect.  This&lt;br /&gt;oil has many therapeutic benefits due to&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s complex nutritional profile so it&#x27;s use&lt;br /&gt;is limitless.  Overall it has regenerative&lt;br /&gt;and moisturizing properties suitable for&lt;br /&gt;a wide array of skin conditions.  This oil&lt;br /&gt;is the medicine of all medicinal oils.</li>
    <li> This is a top quality Tamanu oil with a rich, woody-spicy oil scent.  This oil is mostly known for it&#x27;s wound-healing properties, especially for skin conditions.  It is fantastic for burns, cuts, eczema, burns, rashes and insect bites.  I apply it directly to the skin, or sometimes mix it with a carrier oil.  A head&#x27;s up: if you have nut allergies you should not use this oil.  A few years ago I went on jungle tour through Belize.  As I walked across a long rope bridge, one of the planks broke and my leg fell through, scraping and injuring my skin severely.  After that I suffered from a severe skin condition that was due (according to my doctors) to a tropical disease that they could not pinpoint.  I tried everything, topical medications, antibiotics and more.  Nothing worked and the skin infection lasted on for 3 more years.  Finally someone told me to try Tamanu oil.  I rubbed some on my leg and then applied a wet, warm cloth over it and left it on for about an hour at a time (twice day).  After 3 days of doing this my infection was gone.  I had not worn shorts for 3 years, but after applying this I was able to wear shorts again and show off my legs.  I am thrilled I was able to purchase this at a discount for my review.  It truly is a miraculous oil that I would highly recommend people try who have skin conditions that are hard to treat and/or heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Product purchased at a discount in exchange for my review</li>
    <li> I really like this Tamanu Oil. It seems like it is good for many uses and it very multipurpose. Essential oils are wonderful because they are all natural. I tried it on a small rash and it seemed to help. Also tried it on my BF stinky feet and it helped.  I liked the consistency as it went on really easy and I didn&#x27;t need much. It is a large  bottle.  The smell was light and pleasant. Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> I am in love with essential oils by Majestic Pure. They are truly my favorite essential oils company and I own many of their oils. That being said, it comes to no shock that I also love their Tamanu oil. Prior to purchasing the oil for review during a promotional period, I had never heard of it. I did a little research on how I could use the oil and saw that it was beneficial for eczema. I have 3 children who suffer from eczema and one has it so bad during the summer that his eczema spots bleed. With California already being in a state of summer, his eczema has flared up. I did as the instructions say which is to put some on a cotton ball and apply to skin. After about 2 applications, I noticed a major difference in the plea dance of his eczema!!! I also read that it was good for the hair. I diluted the Tamanu oil with coconut oil, because while the oil is very effective it has a strong scent. Like a woodsy earthy smell that is extremely potent. I diluted it with coconut oil to apply to my hair. After dilution I applied the oil combo to my hair and it was immediately shinier! I am going to continue to use it not only in my hair but my daughters as well as they suffer from dry hair! The bottle was perfectly packaged and arrived undamaged. It is a nice big 4oz sized bottle which will last me for quite some time!! I love this product!!! **I purchased this item for review during a promotional period and any opinions expressed are my own!**</li>
    <li> This is my very first bottle of Tamu oil and I was not expecting the oil to be so thick! The oil came nicely packaged in a dark glass bottle with a glass dropper. The dropper makes it easy to dispense the right amount of oil. I purchased this product using a one time promotional code, this review is written in my own words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I hate the scent of this oil! It smells like old muddy roots. The oil is thick and has some texture, surprisingly the oil is quickly absorbed into the skin. I use this oil to treat my husband&#x27;s skin eczema. The oil has severely reduced redness, itchy feelings and discomfort. I apply about 3-4 drops of oil on the infected area and leave it to dry. Since I do not like the scent of this oil, I add a drop of Majestic Pure lavender oil and it makes the strong scent go away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is a wonderful remedy and has saved my husband&#x27;s skin! I also use this oil in my hair and I have seen a huge improvement! My hair and skin feel and look a lot healthier ever since I begun using this oil. Majestic Pure uses 100% pure and natural products. I love Tamanu oil and would give this a two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I am LOVING this Tamanu oil. Previously, I was honestly unfamiliar with the product. After doing some research I knew it could go into cold-process soap but I wondered about the benefits of PURE Tamanu oil on my acne scarring. After a week I am noticing a slightly diminished scarring pattern and hope to see more in the future. It is also good for stretch marks, burn scars, abrasions, cuts, etc. I love the Majestic Pure company and all their products that I have purchased for my (cold-process soap business) as well as personal use have been amazing!</li>
    <li> I am writing a review after nearly 1 month in of commencing use (June 5).  I had never heard of this oil, but am a user of different oils (exclusively) in my beauty routines, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. The 1st thing I want to mention is the company (seller) of this oil gives the most stellar customer service; checking in within a week to see how I was liking the oil, etc, and continued to check in with personal emails. Correspondances were always gracious.  I embarked on a controlled experiment, using this exclusively 2x a day on clean skin (face &amp; neck), after my morning shower and at night after shower.&lt;br /&gt; Here are the remark-able characteristics I noted:&lt;br /&gt;1) First and foremost, one should be very careful with applying it to areas around the eyes where it can travel (as skin warms) into the eyes.  BURNS.  It also has a somewhat caustic taste as well.&lt;br /&gt;2). The oil is a thicker oil than most (popular) natural beauty oils, compared to emu, jojoba, argan, -has a similar viscosity to extra virgin Olive oil, and takes quite a while (about 1hour) to be completely absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;3). Because of this viscosity, one uses quite bit and a four ounce bottle can go rather quickly, depending on where all applied. I sometimes use a light application on my arms as well, and at 3 weeks in, I am down to exactly 1/2 the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;4).Tamanu oil has a distinct earthy scent: I liken it to a mixture of:  cold-pressed, Extra-Virgin Olive oil,  Patchouli,  and anything else that is wild &amp; earthy-smelling, -though this blend isn’t unpleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;Strangely, my dog LOVES for me to pour some in my hand so she can lick it up. She comes to the bathroom door and waits for me to do this once she smells that I am using it.&lt;br /&gt;5). I do not notice a whole lot of improvement or change in the texture of my skin, likely because my skin is already very good from long-term usage with other oils, except I do think I seem to notice a  slight fading of the brown spots on my face (3 weeks in). I need more time on this to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;6). I read that this oil can promote the growth of new skin, so I applied it to a fresh laceration on my leg, and also a fresh painful raw, torn hangnail. Remarkably, those areas seemed to heal (close the skin) overnight with 1 application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will likely keep applying it to my facial brown spots, just to see if the (brown spot) fading is in fact true, (and I will let you know down the road). It is a very interesting oil and I was delighted that it is organic &amp; pure, and I will use it in rotation with my other oil products. I actually like that it is heavier and has those other unique characteristics- its a standout from the other common light-scented &amp; light-viscous beauty oils.on this to be sure. 6).

    <li> My hair feels d soft . I love it. I did receieve this item to review.</li>
    <li> Tamanu Oil is best known for it&#x27;s healing properties, but it&#x27;s really great for many things. I&#x27;ve been adding a few drops to my moisturizer and into my conditioner, too. It does have a sweet, nutty scent but it&#x27;s not at all. It absorbs into the skin nicely without leaving a horrible film afterwards. This huge 4 Oz bottle will surely me a long time, and I always know I am getting quality product when it comes from Majestic Pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Great oil , i use on my face before bed time , I can see a huge change on my skin condition plus i gave used it with my scars and it really has faded it away, very awesome oil.</li>
    <li> Oil is of very good quality and we could see some visible changes in our Face.</li>
    <li> When I saw all the different healing abilities that Tamanu Oil has, I had to get some. I was offered this Tamanu Oil from Majestic Pure for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle. There are so many different hair, skin, and nail issues that Tamanu oil and help with like toenail fungus, skin rashes, dry scalp, I mean really you have an issue, put this on it. Since it is all natural, I am also able to use it on my young children instead of some chemical infused cream or spray. I am even able to put it on any pimples or acne scars to help diminish their appearance. If you are looking for something natural that really helps a range of skin issues, I recommend this Tamanu Oil from Majestic Pure.</li>
    <li> awesome product! Highly recommend!  Essential oils at it&#x27;s finest!  Plus the bottle is large!</li>
    <li> Watch the costs of this product I paid 31.50 next day it was 21.50</li>
    <li> We love the scent of the Tamanu Oil.  This is 100% pure and excellent oil to use on hair for a nice healthy shine.  We received this product at a promotional price for sample and review.  The 4oz bottle is very large, and priced very reasonably at 21.50.  I have used it only on my hair, but know that the oil is also very useful for healing cuts, scrapes, bites, dry skin conditions, etc.</li>
    <li> Great oil for skin care. I also use it in a blend for healing wounds that I take in my first aid kit. I have used it in my facial serum for the past few months and am happy with the results. It does have a woodsy or earthy smell so I would not put it on in the morning.</li>
    <li> A good aditive for a number of lotions. really helps to heal and firm up the skin. Came nicely packaged and ready to use. Glad I got it.  I got this product at a reduced rate in return for reviewing it, but I am very glad that I did.</li>
    <li> Super good service!!  I got it with broken glass tube and cracked bottle. They just sent me another one right away within a week. For the product, it&#x27;s good. I found it&#x27;s so oily and I didn&#x27;t like it. However, the feelings of oily goes away after an hour and it can reach the point as it stated.....</li>
    <li> Only tried it a couple of times. Verdict is out. Received quickly and was as described.</li>
    <li> This oil works great on old acne scars and rashes. I have combination and somewhat sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve been sing this oil for a couple of weeks and I notice a slight difference in my acne scars they seem to be less noticeable and I also had a really red rash on my chest it just came out of nowhere I applied this oil and it was gone in 3 days. I would definitely recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> I like this oil it works pretty good. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent of it but that is the scent it is and keeps it natural which I do like about it. The bottle is a nice large size and everything is easy to read the dropper makes it easy to use. I was sent this product free to review I would recommend it to others</li>
    <li> Tamanu oil is really great. It has a nice woodsy smell to it. This comes in a nice big 4 oz bottle with a glass eyedropper. I use this oil to make lotions as it&#x27;s very good on skin conditions so I have been using it for stretch marks, dry skin, eczema, anti aging. Seriously the uses for this oil is amazing. I am loving it and look forward to finding more uses for it. I purchased this during a promotional period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I love this Tamanu Oil!  I had never heard of this oil before. At first it smelled like raisins to me-go figure!  I really don&#x27;t know what it smells like!  Just a clean outdoorsy smell.  Of all of the issues the description lists-it seems this suits me just fine.  I sound like a mess!  I put this on my face first, then on to my sandpaper elbows, then legs, arms -on &amp; on. It soaks in to the skin &amp; doesn&#x27;t really feel greasy.  I love it!  I received this at a reduced price for an honest opinion.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> I was a bit surprised by the scent of this at first but after a few applications I&#x27;m used to it.  It smells a little nutty... can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it.  Nice texture and it absorbs well!  Bought this to use on a rash on my legs that I&#x27;ve been trying to clear up for over two years... I&#x27;ll update this review later with my results!</li>
    <li> Wow! This product is AMAZING!!! I just purchased it for its purported benefits for skin regeneration, little did I know I would really need it more than I anticipated when I purchased it. I bought it thinking I&#x27;ll use it mostly at night with my night cream to help better my skin. I ended up having to have surgery on my wrist and when my cast was removed, the cut was so ghastly. Within 2 days of using it, I could literally see a HUGE difference. The gash started to close in quicker and get smaller. Now, even though it&#x27;s only been about 11 days, the scar looks like I may have had the surgery at least months and months ago. I highly highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I adore essential oils and all they can do for the body and state of mind. Tamanu oil is similar to Frankincense oil to me, has a lot of similar properties and a similar type of smell. Tamanu works fantastic on any eczema, skin issues like psoriasis and dry skin is a thing of the past. I added a few drops to my coconut oil lotion and my skin has never felt better. My daughters eczema has been so much better after using it, she is not scratching all the time. I like the Earthy smell, it&#x27;s comforting, and I absolutely love majestic pure oils. This does not disappoint at all. Fantastic quality oil! I HIGHLY recommend that you add this oil to your essential oil arsenal for any issues you may have in your health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this oil. Great addition to my collection of essential oils.</li>
    <li> this is wonderful!!! the smell and texture of the oil is amazing...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing, I just had surgery and my scar was terrible!! I used for two week and my skin regenerated so fast, I recomend the product 100%, i used it with coconut oil twice a day after cleaning.</li>
    <li> I recently sustained a burn to my forearm and applied the Tamanu oil immediately following the burn.  I noticed a dramatic reduction in the inflammation, redness, and overall swelling of the burn.  Known for promotion of cellular regeneration, this Tamanu oil is cold pressed and unrefined, retaining it&#x27;s dark green coloring.  There is a slight odor that is easily masked with addition of essential oils promoting healing like Helichrysum.</li>
