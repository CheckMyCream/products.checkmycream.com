      <li>i really love that its hypoallergenic</li>
      <li>the Neutrogena concealer stick better.</li>
      <li>Great Product, Arrived Fast.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this.</li>
      <li>The top popped off and sprayed makeup all over my bathroom.</li>
      <li>I love this concealer.</li>
      <li>I normally love Almay products but Almay Wake Up</li>
      <li>This in combination with my CC cream does a pretty good job of creating a more youthful, awake look</li>
      <li>I recommend Almay Line Smoothing concealer, it&#x27;s easy to use and cover my imperfect undereye.</li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s liquid and easy to apply and dries without shine.</li>
      <li>but it was easy to</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;-not as easy to apply as the applicator&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best Concealer I have ever used for dark circles.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, coverage is fine.</li>
      <li>A smooth, creamy texture which applies easily without pulling on the skin under your eye.  </li>
      <li>use the &#x27;light&#x27; and it does well for my light/medium</li>
      <li>I thought it might be the color, so I tried the light color.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, good product!</li>
      <li>the top popped off and it got a crack that the makeup comes out first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>I literally have to hold the top on while I gently squeeze some out.</li>
      <li>find if I hold it the first couple applications it does just fine and doesn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works great to conceal my dark rings</li>
      <li>I apply it from the container to my fingertip for a more complete application.</li>
      <li>Why did they feel they had to come up with something different when the other concealer worked perfectly well ???</li>
      <li>very creamy experience, it really wake up your under eye skin, its easy to use an d</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, decent EWG rating, and covers up dark circles nicely.</li>
      <li>apply it once to the whole eye area, blending in and layering more on the darkest blue areas, then I take a cover up powder (&#x27;true match&#x27;</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this, especially after using the Wake up powder foundation they discontinued (but good news guys, Revlon owns Almay, and their new aqua minerals formula is the same thing).</li>
      <li>When I first tryed to use it the side that holds it all together the plastic broke off.</li>
      <li>that I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>Works very nicely , but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff on top of my tinted moisturizer to further help cover any dark circles under my eyes.</li>
      <li>It comes in a nice squeeze-y tube, and a little brush at the end, almost like a lipgloss.</li>
      <li>used to just how much I needed to do the job.</li>
      <li>or you get too much on the brush</li>
      <li>Much creamier and doesn&#x27;t explode in your purse.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is unfortunate for customers like myself that this seems to be replacing the wonderful product I used before this, which was Almay&#x27;s Line Smoothing product, which has a soft tipped wand for application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The shade is right, and the makeup doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply just have to be careful when squeezing the tube</li>
      <li>High Quality</li>
      <li>It works well as a concealer, but needs a new applicator design.</li>
      <li>The light medium is a little lighter than the CC cream that I use, but it blends well enough that you can&#x27;t really</li>
      <li>I really like the yellow based tint of this make up as it really helps combat the blue circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, as I&#x27;ve bought probably 7 of these over the past year or two, when you go to first squeeze it - do it slowly and make SURE to hold around the plastic tip right before the brush as that part can suddenly come off with too much pressure</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too thick and the cap comes off easy.  </li>
      <li>This concealer worked very well for my dark circles</li>
      <li>It takes very little to cover my dark circles and at first I used too much</li>

<li> I threw them away after several tries.  </li>
<li> This concealer works well with Almay&#x27;s Wake Up loose powder.  </li>
<li> I bought this product in light/medium and it went on well, dried fast, and then: looked dead!  </li>
<li> so little is used at a time one tube will last me a very long time.</li>
<li> I hate this product, and have noticed that I can&#x27;t get my favorite Almay Line Smoothing concealer in the stores, which I loved.(you can still order tubes online, which I promptly did!)</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also kinda hard to determine how much product is squeezed out into the little brush, and then evenly swipe it across your face.</li>
<li> I have been using a solid concealer and it seemed dry and hard to blend in.</li>
<li> This concealer, however is VERY yellow, and hard to apply.</li>
<li> My only complaint is both times I&#x27;ve ordered it from amazon</li>
<li> Even though it has a squeeze applicator type bottle connected to the brush, it is difficult to control how much of the product is released into the brush.&lt;br</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> One little squeeze, and it&#x27;s all over the inside of the cap!</li>
<li> I love this concealer but the squeeze tube is awful.</li>

<li> Not a fan of small brushes.</li>
<li> /&gt;-a little thin</li>
<li> /&gt;It has done well for me over the years, don&#x27;t see how it got such bad reviews...</li>
<li> If it could be worse, it was.  </li>
<li> This tube is terrible to use, can&#x27;t tell how much is going to come out when you squeeze it, the brush is worthless, and you end up wasting a ton when you get a big glob on your finger.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s never been broken.</li>
<li> it has arrived with a hole in bottle, making it impossible to squeeze out the makeup the way it&#x27;s meant to be squeezed out.</li>
<li> bad design!</li>

    <li> Almay products are my favorites and this one certainly is...fast service, excellent price!</li>
    <li> I have been using a solid concealer and it seemed dry and hard to blend in. With this liquid it is easier to apply and blend. Thus not causing&lt;br /&gt;pulling on the tender skin around my eyes.  It takes very little to cover my dark circles and at first I used too much but it was easy to&lt;br /&gt;get used to just how much I needed to do the job. If we are going out for the evening I do reapply a little just to brighten my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;As so little is used at a time one tube will last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> It does the job but what I wasn&#x27;t impressed with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-has a yellowish hew&lt;br /&gt;-not as easy to apply as the applicator&lt;br /&gt;-a little thin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product, thanks!!</li>
    <li> The brush tip is too rough to use on sensitive skin under eyes, so I put it on my fingertip and then apply it. It works well as a concealer, but needs a new applicator design.</li>
    <li> Very good product. tough, durable and economical to use that I give. 100 percent recommended for the purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of small brushes. I like applicators best. Good product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it.  I threw them away after several tries.  It&#x27;s too thick and the cap comes off easy.  I recommend Almay Line Smoothing concealer, it&#x27;s easy to use and cover my imperfect undereye.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff on top of my tinted moisturizer to further help cover any dark circles under my eyes. It&#x27;s a good one for the price. My only complaint is both times I&#x27;ve ordered it from amazon it has arrived with a hole in bottle, making it impossible to squeeze out the makeup the way it&#x27;s meant to be squeezed out. Instead it all comes through the cracked hole. Not sure why because when I buy this from target it&#x27;s never been broken. Other than that, good product!</li>
    <li> I hate this product, and have noticed that I can&#x27;t get my favorite Almay Line Smoothing concealer in the stores, which I loved.(you can still order tubes online, which I promptly did!) This tube is terrible to use, can&#x27;t tell how much is going to come out when you squeeze it, the brush is worthless, and you end up wasting a ton when you get a big glob on your finger. Not to mention that the color is not what the light/medium was in the line concealer...this has more white and yellow which looks fake under your eyes. Why did they feel they had to come up with something different when the other concealer worked perfectly well ??? This is going in the trash!!!!</li>
    <li> Works very nicely , but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Spreads easily good color coverage. , requires reapplication in a couple hours.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, decent EWG rating, and covers up dark circles nicely. Would recommend to others looking for similar product.</li>
    <li> This concealer worked very well for my dark circles I like that it&#x27;s liquid and easy to apply and dries without shine.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this, especially after using the Wake up powder foundation they discontinued (but good news guys, Revlon owns Almay, and their new aqua minerals formula is the same thing). This concealer, however is VERY yellow, and hard to apply. It comes in a nice squeeze-y tube, and a little brush at the end, almost like a lipgloss. But-you can&#x27;t carry this in your purse! One little squeeze, and it&#x27;s all over the inside of the cap! It&#x27;s also kinda hard to determine how much product is squeezed out into the little brush, and then evenly swipe it across your face. All in all, I like the Neutrogena concealer stick better. Much creamier and doesn&#x27;t explode in your purse.</li>

Does great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has done well for me over the years, don&#x27;t see how it got such bad reviews...</li>
    <li> Disappears in less than an hour - this is far inferior to the line smoothing concealer which atleast was moderately helpful.</li>
    <li> A smooth, creamy texture which applies easily without pulling on the skin under your eye.  This concealer works well with Almay&#x27;s Wake Up loose powder.  The brush applicator tip is not useful.  I apply it from the container to my fingertip for a more complete application.</li>
    <li> Works great to conceal my dark rings</li>
    <li> Easy to apply just have to be careful when squeezing the tube or you get too much on the brush but then I just use my finger to apply.</li>
    <li> very creamy experience, it really wake up your under eye skin, its easy to use an d i really love that its hypoallergenic</li>
    <li> This stuff works great but you get quite a bit of it because you have to squeeze the tube.  Go through it a lot quicker than a wand.</li>
    <li> the top popped off and it got a crack that the makeup comes out first time I used it.  do not recommend!  bad design!</li>
    <li> I bought this product in light/medium and it went on well, dried fast, and then: looked dead!  I thought it might be the color, so I tried the light color.  If it could be worse, it was.  It smelled like latex paint and that&#x27;s what it looked like, flat paint. Ugh!  I will go back to my Almay line-smoothing concealer.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this. The shade is right, and the makeup doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I normally love Almay products but Almay Wake Up Undereye Concealer leaves a lot to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is too stiff, especially for use in the very sensitive undereye area.  Even though it has a squeeze applicator type bottle connected to the brush, it is difficult to control how much of the product is released into the brush.&lt;br /&gt;It is unfortunate for customers like myself that this seems to be replacing the wonderful product I used before this, which was Almay&#x27;s Line Smoothing product, which has a soft tipped wand for application.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend Almay Wake Up Undereye Concealer, unless they change the application method.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer but the squeeze tube is awful. The top popped off and sprayed makeup all over my bathroom. I literally have to hold the top on while I gently squeeze some out.</li>
    <li> The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I&#x27;m already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Good product, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover anything, and the plastic tube is extremely fragile. It broke after one use. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> love love love this concealer!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it matches my skin tone perfectly.  It is also truly hypoallergenic and does not bother my eyes and skin at all.</li>
    <li> The light medium is a little lighter than the CC cream that I use, but it blends well enough that you can&#x27;t really tell.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t completely cover the dark lines under my eyes, but I haven&#x27;t found anything that does. This in combination with my CC cream does a pretty good job of creating a more youthful, awake look that I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have first thing in the morning.</li>
    <li> excellent, very good products for my girlfriend. like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Best Concealer I have ever used for dark circles.  Sipped and received on time.  Very Happy.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Product leaked at screw point instead of going to brush. Just threw away the brush and use q-tip to apply. Otherwise, coverage is fine.</li>
    <li> Just tried on hand and looking forward to using on my holiday. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Arrived Fast. High Quality</li>
    <li> When I first tryed to use it the side that holds it all together the plastic broke off. I do not recommend this if you want it but it in stores.</li>
