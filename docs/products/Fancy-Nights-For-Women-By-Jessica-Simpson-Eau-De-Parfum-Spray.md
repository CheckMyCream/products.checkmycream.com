      <li>And I really love patchouli, but not like this.</li>
      <li>love and will always re up when its finished</li>
      <li>I swear BO smells better.</li>
      <li>And bless her heart, this Christmas (2011), she bought me Fancy Love.</li>
      <li>I ordered this item because i was a fan of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Fancy and Fancy love sprays, so i ordered this one.</li>
      <li>but this was a bit overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Love it love</li>
      <li>I wanted Fancy Love and my daughter bought me this, Fancy Nights.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance....</li>
      <li>now I love it</li>
      <li>so I decided to wear it more</li>
      <li>I have I Fancy You, and love the way that smells, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
      <li>I love all her parfume</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with that partum</li>
      <li>As a whole, the scent is surprisingly well done.</li>
      <li>This is not a typical candy sweet scent, it is a warm femme fatale kind of perfume!</li>
      <li>Its a strong woodsy smell.</li>
      <li>At first it kind of reminded me of Tabu which made me nervous because I already have a bottle of Tabu.  </li>
      <li>I wud tell you exactly what the fragrance is really like even though my siblings say its has a great smell...</li>
      <li>First it almost smells like a cologne for men and it is very strong.</li>
      <li>I thought I would give this a try when I got a free sample  of  it.  </li>
      <li>It is light but lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much!!!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to love it so much!  </li>
      <li>I  never ever take the time to write product reviews,  but if I can save even one person from the horror of this perfume, it&#x27;s  worth it!</li>
      <li>I was very surprised at how much I liked this parfum.</li>
      <li>One good thing is that for the price, it is very long lasting and the sillage is great.</li>
      <li>For the price for a full 3.4 ounces</li>
      <li>At first spray I did not like this, a strong patchouli note and a smell like colored halloween hairspray.</li>
      <li>The first spray was so strong</li>
      <li>Wonderfully layered patchouli, pretty average sillage for mainstream perfume and longevity is pretty admirable-- 4-5 hours.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>The vendor sent the order quickly and undamaged.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this scent for those women who are more earthy.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent by far!  </li>
      <li>have really taken to this fragrance; softer version of Shalimar... if you like the smell of powder soft incense you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
      <li>But after a few minutes it settled into a great oriental, I agree that it does remind me of shalimar.</li>
      <li>love the soft scent of this perfume.</li>
      <li>I also purchased fancy love which I did not like all that much, so I went back to fancy nights and love the scent.  </li>
      <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
      <li>The scent is more suitable for those who prefers something more mature and sophisticated other than the conventional fruity or sweet scent.</li>
      <li>Great small.</li>
      <li>but I loved it when it calmed down a bit.</li>
      <li>The only problem for me is that this perfume is just so strong!</li>
      <li>The opening is really strong, almost medicinal, which quickly settles down to a not unpleasant but very distinct smell of shaving cream.</li>
      <li>It is fragrant and pleasant and clean smelling but not overwhelming!</li>
      <li>This fragrance was first given to me as a gift.  </li>
      <li>My advice: Don&#x27;t use more than 1 spray because you definitely wont need it!!</li>
      <li>I am a patchouli freak &amp; I love the fact that there are definite hints of Patchouli &amp; Sandalwood in it.</li>
      <li>At first i did not like this smell thought it was too strong but the strongness goes away super fast and leaves behind a warm musky vanilla smell ...</li>
      <li>Good price for such a big bottle.</li>
      <li>Last week, I was able to try the new one, I Fancy Love and that will be my next one to purchase!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to a friend!</li>
      <li>I really like this scent -</li>
      <li>it really a deal through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t regret it - really</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get much of the vanilla I&#x27;ve seen others report.  </li>
      <li>Very woodsy.</li>
      <li>The whole bottle went straight into the trash.</li>
      <li>I feel very dressed up when I am wearing this  and use it all the time</li>
      <li>very mysterious, deep sensuous kind of smell.</li>
      <li>it was too strong, this is for someone older definitely not for anyone under 40!</li>
      <li>This is totally a Unisex fragrance - overall I love it &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>Not sweet, just lovely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a really nice fragrance for such a low cost.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I got a little grabby on this just because I still can&#x27;t believe that you can get crazy good deals on the million woodsy orientals out there.</li>
      <li>Classy bottle design too!</li>
      <li>soft!</li>
      <li>On me, I get a BIG BLAST of amber buffeted by a much nicer jasmine note than you normally find in these things.</li>
      <li>do not waste your money on this.</li>
      <li>A mature scent, not like her others</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you want to smell like a Man (not a great smelling man) and not a Woman than this fragnance is for you! I have been using it as an air freshener now (because I felt guilty just discarding it) and my family still yells out \\&quot;YUK\\&quot;!!! I think it is time just to get rid of it...</li>
    <li> have really taken to this fragrance; softer version of Shalimar... if you like the smell of powder soft incense you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
    <li> I asked the name of a friend&#x27;s perfume. . .she told me &amp;#34;Fancy Nights&amp;#34; by Jessica Simpson. I decided to try it. . . and voila. The vendor sent the order quickly and undamaged. I really like this scent - now people are asking me . . , what&#x27;s tour perfume!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how much I liked this parfum. I will defiantly order again.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I received a free small bottle of Fancy Nights when I purchased some clothing items at Von Maur.  It was delightful.  The bottle lasted a long time and I was disappointed when I ran out.  I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this item.  I was disappointed when it arrived and it smelled nothing like the first complimentary bottle.  I would not recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> I love Jessica Simpson fancy,  so I thought I would give this a try when I got a free sample  of  it.  It is horrible.  If you are under the age of 85, you should not be wearing this perfume.  One of the girls in my office actually asked why the office smelled like old lady when I wore  it.  Needless to say, when my grandmother smelled it she loved it</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because i was a fan of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Fancy and Fancy love sprays, so i ordered this one. But OMG, this reeks! First it almost smells like a cologne for men and it is very strong. I barely sprayed any on and i caused me to have a major headache. Have to return this A.S.A.P.</li>
    <li> I bought this on ebay, having never smelled it. I have I Fancy You, and love the way that smells, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It is spicy, but soft. It makes a great winter fragrance. Not sweet, just lovely.</li>
    <li> do not waste your money on this. I  love, love, love fancy love by Jessica Simpson and bought this hoping to find another winner.... but the scent was so overwhelming I had a horrible headache the rest of the day. I actually showered again and switched clothes because I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. The whole bottle went straight into the trash. I  never ever take the time to write product reviews,  but if I can save even one person from the horror of this perfume, it&#x27;s  worth it!</li>
    <li> At first i did not like this smell thought it was too strong but the strongness goes away super fast and leaves behind a warm musky vanilla smell ...and now I am addicted to this smell...its an acquired smell.</li>
    <li> I did not like this scent it was too strong, this is for someone older definitely not for anyone under 40!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woodsy/oriental fan from way back when the perfume industry still held sway on &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fruity-floral&amp;#34; scents. Honestly, I got a little grabby on this just because I still can&#x27;t believe that you can get crazy good deals on the million woodsy orientals out there. I don&#x27;t regret it - really, if you ever get grabby feelings about fragrance less than $15 you should just go for it. That said, this doesn&#x27;t conform to my expectations for a woodsy-oriental scent. On me, I get a BIG BLAST of amber buffeted by a much nicer jasmine note than you normally find in these things. I don&#x27;t think it smells particularly masculine, but it definitely is not a girly scent. As a whole, the scent is surprisingly well done. If you have any need of an amber-jasmine-patchouli scent, at this price, why wouldn&#x27;t you?</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance....I also purchased fancy love which I did not like all that much, so I went back to fancy nights and love the scent.  It is light but lasts all day.  I work in an office and people ask me what I am wearing.  For the price for a full 3.4 ounces it really a deal through Amazon.  Shipped very quickly, double wrapped.  I purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with that partum I love all her parfume</li>
    <li> I dont like this scent. Its a strong woodsy smell.</li>
    <li> This fragrance was first given to me as a gift.  I didn&#x27;t expect to love it so much!  This is my go to fragrance now, and this is a great buy!</li>
    <li> love the soft scent of this perfume. I feel very dressed up when I am wearing this  and use it all the time</li>
    <li> So when I first purchased  the big bottle from TJ maxx for $9.99 I hated it ....it was so stank omg  my nose was burning from how bad it smelled so I decided to wear it more so I can get used to it now I love it I wear it every night when I get out of the shower ....it takes a little getting use to it because it smells like its ment for old people but once the scent settles it smells so damn good</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this perfume! I am a patchouli freak &amp; I love the fact that there are definite hints of Patchouli &amp; Sandalwood in it. The only problem for me is that this perfume is just so strong! Seriously! I am a perfume fanatic and I like to use alot, but this was a bit overwhelming. I can only use a tiny bit of this. My advice: Don&#x27;t use more than 1 spray because you definitely wont need it!! Other than that the scent it great! Very woodsy.</li>
    <li> Item came in time. The scent is more suitable for those who prefers something more mature and sophisticated other than the conventional fruity or sweet scent. It reminds me of the perfume, Poison. It wasn&#x27;t my type or liking. Gave my mum and she loves it. One good thing is that for the price, it is very long lasting and the sillage is great.</li>
    <li> I bought Fancy Nights because I previously bought Fancy Love (which I love), but this specific perfume (fancy nights) smells awful. I am not exaggerating. I don&#x27;t know if I got the fake one or if the product actually smells like that. I haven&#x27;t smelled this perfume at the department store.   I wonder how others feel about this product.</li>
    <li> Last Christmas (2010) I wanted Fancy Love and my daughter bought me this, Fancy Nights. Too strong and with a cinnamon base, I can&#x27;t wear it. Before Christmas 2011, I tried wearing it again. Every time I turned suddenly, I got a whiff of cinnamon, thinking someone was chewing gum or a mint. No, it was me! Before I my throat swelled up and I couldn&#x27;t breathe, I had to go and wash it off of my chest, where I sprayed. Will never wear it again. None of my daughters like it either and the one wasted money on something I can&#x27;t wear. And bless her heart, this Christmas (2011), she bought me Fancy Love. Last week, I was able to try the new one, I Fancy Love and that will be my next one to purchase!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but I had to for this.  THIS IS THE WORST SMELLING PERFUME EVER, and I&#x27;ve tried to wash it off and the smell won&#x27;t leave.  I don&#x27;t even have words to describe how awful it smells, unless you want to smell like black licorice and a pine tree combined.  Love her other scents, this one makes me sick.  Read the other reviews about acquiring the smell, I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s possible.  I swear BO smells better.</li>
    <li> love and will always re up when its finished</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it make me vomit.</li>
    <li> The product is genuine and smells great . I love it .</li>
    <li> The smell is not exactly my taste, but it came as ordered.</li>
    <li> At first spray I did not like this, a strong patchouli note and a smell like colored halloween hairspray. But after a few minutes it settled into a great oriental, I agree that it does remind me of shalimar. A mature scent, not like her others, I enjoy all of her scents for what they are and for the price I find them all great quality.</li>
    <li> Would not buy again. Not for me. I love her Fancy Love, which is my favorite one from her. Not for me.</li>
    <li> A very nice  smelling perfume. Highly recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> I have purchased four bottles already. i get many compliments from my patients. It  lasts long.&lt;br /&gt;Yet soft! Classy bottle design too!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time though...am yet to see n perceive what I bought because it needs to travel all the way to nigeria meet me...so when it gets here I wud tell you exactly what the fragrance is really like even though my siblings say its has a great smell...vey matured....</li>
    <li> Great layering scent, and also a fragrance that very closely resembles Prada perfume for Women. Wonderfully layered patchouli, pretty average sillage for mainstream perfume and longevity is pretty admirable-- 4-5 hours.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a really nice fragrance for such a low cost.  I am always getting complements when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I am surprised by the frequency with which reviewers refer to this as reminding them of old ladies...to me this scent is quite masculine due to the note of shaving cream (think old-school Barbasol in a can) that predominates in the first several hours of wearing this. The opening is really strong, almost medicinal, which quickly settles down to a not unpleasant but very distinct smell of shaving cream. After that, closer to the skin it is dry, papery and slightly smokey.  I don&#x27;t get much of the vanilla I&#x27;ve seen others report.  It has lasting power like whoa...just got out of the shower and I can still smell it on my skin after applying about 8 hours ago.  Really like the bottle, hate the name, undecided on the juice.  Can&#x27;t beat the price for a blind buy, though.</li>
    <li> Very nice perfume. Everybody like the it, my husband says the is the best perfume I have ! Thank you so much!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite scent by far!  Been wearing it for over two years!  Love it love it love it! Highly recommend this scent for those women who are more earthy.</li>
    <li> Amazing perfume. I loved its light. Its definitely a night scent. very mysterious, deep sensuous kind of smell. Its a steal for the price.</li>
    <li> it smells ok, but its too weak, it doesnt last even 30min</li>
    <li> This is not a typical candy sweet scent, it is a warm femme fatale kind of perfume! The first spray was so strong but I loved it when it calmed down a bit. I need a back up bottle of it!!</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on this scent! But my body distorts perfume so may be different on someone else. It is fragrant and pleasant and clean smelling but not overwhelming!</li>
    <li> Great small. Good price for such a big bottle. Shipped quickly. Packed nicely. Great looking bottle. No more words to say.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and was packaged nicely &#x3D;)  At first it kind of reminded me of Tabu which made me nervous because I already have a bottle of Tabu.  But then I compared it and I can smell the difference &#x3D;)  It&#x27;s definitely not a floral or fruity fragrance its a definitely mature.  Smells of trees, spices, and musk.  This is totally a Unisex fragrance - overall I love it &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I get this for my Aunt.  It is her favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! Smells so earthy and musky!</li>
    <li> Cross between patchouli and old lady perfume. And I really love patchouli, but not like this. It&#x27;s bad.</li>
    <li> my favorite fragrance. can&#x27;t even find in any stores anymore. Going to buy another. This scent is romantic oriental scent. Don&#x27;t expect floral.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and everyone seems to like it on me!  Perfect for work or night out with friends, or just whenever</li>
