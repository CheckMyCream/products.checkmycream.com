      <li>They&#x27;re hold is great, it makes buns a lot easier to style, and it makes them look a lot nicer than when I used regular bobby pins.</li>

      <li>I have thin medium length hair, and when I wrap it into a bun, and place the spin pin on bottom &amp; top, it holds incredibly well.  </li>
      <li>smaller size is perfect for creating smaller buns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;These little pins are great because they don&#x27;t pinch and get stuck in your hair like bobby pins do, and they really do the work of many bobby pins.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have these, and the full sized spin-pins. LOVE them! My daughter dances, and this holds her hair in place all day.</li>
    <li> I like these spin pins very much and the seem to be holding their shape very well with continual use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got thick, long and course hair. Regular hair pins usually do one of two things: a) fall out or b) break. For falling out or breakage to not occur, I&#x27;ve had to use upwards of 10 pins just to secure my hair into a bun. I only have to use 4 spin pins now to secure my hair tightly and securely for the entire day in whatever type of bun or twist I want. I&#x27;ve been using almost daily for about a month now and they have yet to break under the weight of my hair. I have dark brown hair, and although the pins come in one color (gold), they&#x27;re not visible in my hair and don&#x27;t stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To insert them, you simply twist clockwise. And to remove, you twist counter clockwise. Simply as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and as a side note, I&#x27;m amused by how they resemble little DNA double helix&#x27;s. If I ever decide to not wear them in my hair, I could get crafty and fashion them into nerdy DNA earrings :)</li>
    <li> works so well in my daughter&#x27;s hair. wish I would have had these when I was younger. Would have made long hair easier</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something that help me make a hair bun without showing the pin.  This mini one works well with my thin hair in middle length.  If you have normal volume long hair I recommended you get the bigger one.</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair, you don&#x27;t need this.  Don&#x27;t let buzzfeed lie to you.  A hair tie/ 1 bobby pin will have you covered.</li>
    <li> Love the instant bun I can get with this.  I have med length thin hair and can get away with just one for a bun that is not too fussy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeballing these doodads for a while, wondering how they&#x27;d work. I had avoided them because I had this vision of them getting snagged in my wavy hair, especially in the back where it tends to tangle. I finally broke down and bought a three-pack of the minis and I&#x27;m impressed. My hair&#x27;s kind of a long bob right now, with a lot of layers. I have tried all kinds of pins and clips with so-so results, but I twist my hair into a bun or into whatever, screw these things in and they really hold the style well. They&#x27;re comfortable, hold a long time and remove easily by twisting them out counter-clockwise, with no tangle or fuss. This is an amazing little product.</li>
    <li> After several failure to make a &#x27;presentable&#x27; bun with other hair tools(donut,sponge,bobby hairpin, chopstick), I thought I would give these little guys a try and yay! it works!  I have a straight medium-length, medium-thickness hair and these mini spin pins are just perfect.  They are easy to use, hold up the bun well and it feels comfortable.  I love it that no hair band is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos for the person who invented this thing.</li>
    <li> These work great for my baby-fine hair. I can twist it all up into a bun, then use these bad boys to keep it all up and tight- but not so tight that I get a headache.</li>
    <li> Yes, they are great. I used to use the full size but after a significant hair cut these are better. I only use two to make a bun with my fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> I use these every day to secure my hair. They are super easy to put in and take out, and my hair never falls out of place anymore. I also bought the larger size. I use the different sizes according to the hair style I want.</li>
    <li> Not to crazy about them</li>
    <li> I have fine shoulder-length hair and still needed to use bobby pins to keep hair in place.</li>
    <li> These are the neatest little gadgets to be invented for more exciting hair options in a long time!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love spin pins, but these are just too small to keep my hai contained. They really need to be a teensy bit bigger.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well in my hair, would always fall out.  Not recommended</li>
    <li> I found out about these mini pins in a youtube video, and couldn&#x27;t believe they&#x27;d hold hair up that well.  Well, they do!  I have thin medium length hair, and when I wrap it into a bun, and place the spin pin on bottom &amp; top, it holds incredibly well.  A whole day in windy weather, a nap (yes - nap!) and the pins were still holding the bun perfectly in place.  I ordered these on subscribe &amp; save, which was cheaper, but didn&#x27;t allow the possibility to pick color.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I like it! I was concern because my hair is havy and usually with bobby pins follows down, plus I have to use like 50 bobby pins (not kidding) with this mini spins pins is easy, and fast!</li>
    <li> My daughter needs a bun for dance class that can withstand 3 hours of high energy dancing. Usually I need to pack her bun with 15+ Bobby pins, but THREE of these lock her bun into place. They screw in and out easily without poking her scalp and hold her hairstyle beautifully. I plan to get a few more packs so I&#x27;m never at a loss!</li>
    <li> I LOVE using these pins to put my hair up, quickly and easily. It&#x27;s great for mornings that I slept on wet hair the night before. You can put your hair up in a bun before school or work and still look professional (compared to a pony tail). I always get lots of compliments and people asking how I got my hair into such a perfect bun. These pins twist right in and stay locked all day.</li>
    <li> these hair pins work better than seller stated. they are absolutely amazing. I have and  would recommend to everyone that puts hair up</li>
    <li> its very strong and hold your hair very good, and easy to use,if there moor different colours it well be better</li>
    <li> These hold my thin fine hair up well all day without causing a headache. I would recomend these for anyone that doesn&#x27;t do well with a ponytail or people just trying to do something different with their hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick, waist length hair for which I use standard length Spin Pins for French Twists, chigons or plain buns. The short length is perfect for putting up my hair all about my head -so well that people gave panicked that I&#x27;ve cut it all off. No bobby pins can withstand the heaviness, Spin Pins are indispensable.</li>
    <li> My hair goes to my lower back, and two of these will keep it in a bun all day</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews for these I ventured to buy.  I am graying and color and highlight my medium length ultra thin, fly away hair.  There are few products that truly hold my hair in place without causing skin irritation (i.e. hairsprays and gels), headaches, pulling half of my hair out when I take it down or usually they just plain don&#x27;t work.  This is the exception!!!  Wet or dry this will hold a bun in place with no slips.  Whether its a neat bun for work or messy weekend updo these always keep everything right where I want and super simple to use.  A must have in any girls hair styling arsenal.</li>
    <li> I love these pins...mini or full size.&lt;br /&gt;They hold my fine layered hair in buns like no other pin.&lt;br /&gt;A must have in your hair stash!</li>
    <li> Normally I need like ten-fifteen pins to hold my hair well in the bun, but three of these one&#x27;s and it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s place, really good pins!</li>
    <li> I ordered two and discovered that &amp;#34;assorted colours&amp;#34; really does mean they send you whatever they&#x27;ve got...I got one set of light and one of dark. Why don&#x27;t you set up separate listings?? Dark ones are terrible for light-coloured hair, and vice-versa.</li>
    <li> I have a bigger sized set of these and love them. I put my hair in a bun when it&#x27;s wet so that my will curl when I take it out. My hair is wavy but gets frizzy unless inuse my spin pins. I got these for my mom since she has shorter and thinner hair than I do. She loves them too!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these. They&#x27;re hold is great, it makes buns a lot easier to style, and it makes them look a lot nicer than when I used regular bobby pins. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> For all of you challenged fledgeling dance moms out there, BUY THIS PRODUCT.  Before finding this product, I had the hardest time trying to create the classic wrapped cinnamon bun.  Prices on amazon are much better than the local grocery store.  Cannot have enough of these on hand.</li>
    <li> I love these Goody Spin Pins and now have two sets of the larger ones, as well as this smaller three-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The insert comes with instructions for how to use these for different styles, but they&#x27;re really versatile to use for any kind of bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use them, just be sure that you are catching some of the hair that is on your head, or they won&#x27;t hold in place as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also want to be sure that you don&#x27;t accidentally lock them into each other when you&#x27;re twisting each one into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smaller size is perfect for creating smaller buns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like using the larger ones at night to make a soft, high bun so I can watch TV and rest my head on a pillow, without something digging into my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These hold your bun nice and tight for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why somebody didn&#x27;t invent these sooner!  I sure could have used these in the 80&#x27;s! LOL.  Spin Pins hold my long, straight, fine, delicate hair in styles I never dreamed of and I don&#x27;t have to dump a ton of product like hair gel in my hair to give the pins traction.  I can just use my straight, slippery hair and these pins don&#x27;t care!&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped right away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been growing out a short cut for over a year now and haven&#x27;t been able to pull off an updo without 17 pins until I got these babies.</li>
    <li> These are the best- I use two long ones and one or two short ones to hold my very long hair into a solid bun. The short ones are also great for half-up styles!</li>
    <li> I have crazy, thick heavy hair.  I used to use 20 bobby pins to get my hair up and I still usually ended up with a floppy weird pony tail 2 hours into my 12 hour shifts.  Two to three of these bad boys holds my hair up in a bun all day.  Nurses... These things are made for us!</li>
    <li> If you ever put your hair up, these are indispensable. I use them every day. These work WAY better than hair elastics and make bobby pins pretty much useless for putting your hair up. I have curly hair down to the middle of my back that I straighten sometimes. It works for both ways (straight hair is MUCH harder to keep up than curly and these do a spectacular job of doing it). I can even wear these for ballet, that&#x27;s how secure they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing, the Goody brand ones are very expensive. If you go on ebay and look for spiral pins you can find 10 packs for $2. I have a giant box full of these now.</li>
    <li> These spin pins work really well. They are easy to apply and easy to remove without pulling and breaking my hair</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but these work wonders. I have long, very thick hair. I was able to pin up my hair using the 3 pins. They do not slip at all. Wish I would have bought more.</li>
    <li> I got these for my sister, and she says they work great. She has long hair, and does it in an updo every day for work. They are pretty much amazing!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> the best styling tool for a bun, hands down. I have long hair down to my lower back........ great tool, bun stays in place.</li>
    <li> I love these. Always used to use pens or pencils and my head would ache... but not with these. My hair is a little to short for them now and thought these shorter ones would work better but they didn&#x27;t. So basically, don&#x27;t buy them for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use.  I usually need several bobby pins to pull off an updo.  I can get my hair up with 2 or 3 spin pins.  So easy!</li>
    <li> My hair is medium-length &amp; is a challenge for regular pins. These proved to hold it in place securely &amp; don&#x27;t fall out. If they work on my hair, they will work for anybody else :) I am going to buy more of these.</li>
    <li> I have ridiculously fine and thin hair.  This works, but not great.  It&#x27;s easy enough to roll up my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t stay that well.  If I sprayed my hair, it would probably hold better.  But again, my hair is very fine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this for straight, not thick hair like mine. These pins do not keep my hair. Unfortunately useless.</li>
    <li> I am terrible at doing my hair, but these are foolproof. I have a lot of fine, short/medium length hair that doesn&#x27;t curl and slips out of every updo, but spin pins keep it all off my neck all day long.</li>
    <li> For once I&#x27;ve found a hair product that does what it promises. I bought a set of these yesterday, and I wore them in my hair today with great results. I did the half/mini bun and only had to use two pins. One held it in just fine, but I needed the second to keep the ends tidy. It worked just as well whether my hair was dry or wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have shortish (1-2\\&quot; below my shoulders), fine hair, I&#x27;m actually able to make a bun using all my hair with two or three of these without a ponytail holder, which is something to keep in mind if you&#x27;re debating between this product or the set of 2 larger pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These little pins are great because they don&#x27;t pinch and get stuck in your hair like bobby pins do, and they really do the work of many bobby pins. I think this is my favorite hair product purchase.</li>
    <li> I have waist length, medium thick, fine straight hair, so for full updos, I prefer the regular sized pins. These work fantastically well for partial updos. Twist the hair into place, then twist the pin in the bun to hold it. They will hold all day. They also work on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has very thick, curly, medium coarse hair that&#x27;s mid-back length, and the same 3 pins work great for partial updos for her as well. The spin seems to lock them in place, and spin them in the opposite direction for easy removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this.  I have thick hair and I wore it partial up one day to work.  Within an hour It was falling out and I had to put it back up into a boring pony tail.  I however am not the best with doing my hair, so may work well if you know what you are doing.  I will try it out more though.</li>
    <li> The product itself is good, tricky getting them to work with my hair style. I happened to be in my local dollar tree and found a 3 pack of small or a 2 pack of the larger ones for $1. Amazon got me! :(</li>
    <li> These are a life saver! My hair kinda long (it&#x27;s almost to my knees) and just three pins hold my hair in a bun that doesn&#x27;t move all day. I have to use my second pack of pins when i do a french twist. It does take a few practice runs to know how to get the pins in to a position that doesn&#x27;t cause a pressure point on the scalp but is holding hair very taut. I recommend highly</li>
    <li> The full and true description of the item. Good price.</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy/straight and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of weight so it&#x27;s a challenge to keep a bun in place. The only thing that holds my hair is hair elastics, BUT then it loosens within an hour. So, I was hopeful these pins would work b/c I saw them being used on a You Tube video, but skeptical b/c they seem like another hair gimmick. After two hours my bun is still in intact and has not loosened. BTW, the regular size would have been too long for my hair I would only recommend the regular size to someone with a lot of hair. This mini size works perfect!!!! Also, I purchased the darker color not the gold that I think is being sold on Amazon - not sure why I can&#x27;t find the darker color?</li>
    <li> Great idea - super easy to use.  Helps you make a nice looking bun and you can get creative with whatever updo you want to try.  Only drawback is the price - i&#x27;m guessing that will come down after multiple companies come out with their knock-offs.</li>
    <li> Oh how I love these are my favorite new hair gadget.  They really hold hair in place.  It is so easy to create tame or wild looks with these pins.  I have two sets of the large pins and two sets of the mini pins.  I love to play around with them and create different styles.</li>
    <li> The product was as stated but did not WORK like they said. Plus it was a bump that wasn&#x27;t pleasant with headrests in the car and all.</li>
    <li> I tried every which way to get these to work and they just didn&#x27;t. I have thin curly hair which stays up better by me just twisting myself</li>
    <li> These work remarkably well.</li>
    <li> takes all 3 to hold up my small bun,</li>
    <li> Terrible and hurt my scalp.  Sent it back with other things.</li>
    <li> I got these for myself last year.  They work so well I can put my hair up in a bun or rooster comb without even looking.  They don&#x27;t protrude like the alligator clips so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your head if you fall asleep with them in.  I liked them so much I ordered this set for my daughter and she loves them too.</li>
    <li> GOODY is right!  If you like to do some up-dos, then you NEED these pins.  Talk about a quick and easy do!!  Say goodbye to your old bottom-of-your-makeup-bag hairpins.  These things are the DEAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two packs of them and with a thick, glossy mane of hair like mine (okay fine it&#x27;s sort of thick and only long because I&#x27;m too lazy to get it cut), I usually use a small handful.  Get the minis if you have thinner hair!!  I use those sometimes and my daughter (8 years old) can use them, too.</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair these are the best pins for putting your hair up. The mini&#x27;s are only good for half you hair, if you have a lot of hair- which I do. I have the regular length and the combo of both sizes is a great tool for various hair styles.</li>
    <li> Best bobby pins ever!  You put them in and you leave them all day long!  I am a pretty active person with very thin hair (7 marathons, surf, skydive, scuba, fly etc...) these things stay in place.  I love them!</li>
    <li> This is the second set of these pins I have purchased.  The first was the larger pins that come with only two in the package.  I love having the shorter pins they help with tighter buns.  I frequently use a small pin to secure the end of my bun and then a longer pin to secure the entire bun to my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these to anyone that has to wear their hair up a lot.  It eliminated my migraine and I think it is better for my hair than tight elastic bands.</li>
    <li> I use these in my daughters hair to make little up buns for school. She loves them and they are so easy to use. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Trying to get pins to stay in thin fine hair is always a challenge! These pins hold my hair in a bun all day! They don&#x27;t slide out like bobby pins do, and look nice as well. If you have trouble keeping pins in your fine hair..these are the perfect pins for you!</li>
    <li> These are really cool and most of all, they work! They will hold up all kinds of fun twisting hairstyles much more effectively than bobby pins. I have waist-length, medium-thickness hair, and like to do buns and twists to keep my hair under control. Three of these mini ones will indeed hold up a bun, although they work better on a half-bun. I think I will buy the long ones as well for when I want all my hair up. They are basically screws for hair, and the concept is spot-on. Just decide whether you want the long or short ones based on how much you have and its weight. I recommend!</li>
    <li> I have fine dark hair, and clips are either too tiny or too big to give me a secure hold when i want to put my hair up.  These spin-pins are perfect!  The instructions are so easy to follow.  Thanks to emilynoel and beauty broadcast on YouTube, i found something to give me a neat bun/updo without any hassle and any chance of even wind knocking my hair down.  LOVE these things!</li>
    <li> I saw the high reviews and so many who had thin hair that raved about the hold these give that I wanted to try them. I went on Youtube and was really amazed at how easy and versatile they are to use so that sealed the deal. I bought 2 packages with 3 each. I am so excited at how well they work I had to write a review right away. There is nothing like these. Forget all the barrettes, clips, bun makers, etc., this takes all their places. You can have a french roll, a bun, or many other types of hair styles in minutes. I have chin length hair and I did a bun after I opened them. It came out perfect, and I have very thin, fine hair. I put 1 in and my bun has held all day, I am speechless. Normally, after a full day of bobby pins I get hair slipping out, but NONE with these. My daughter has fine hair but down a couple inched below her shoulders, with layers. I did a french roll on hers (a fast type) and now only did it look like she spent a long time on it, but it only took 2 of these pins. AMAZING! It&#x27;s still in place and she has chased around and played with her 2 year old son. You have to use these to believe how cool they are. Comfortable too, you can&#x27;t feel them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the one and only con is you can&#x27;t pick your color. I have light blonde hair and hoped by ordering 2 packages I would get a blonde color. Both packages are for dark hair. It isn&#x27;t a huge deal because they go through your hair and if a tip is kind of showing, you can easily hide it with your hair. The stay in place so no worries there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend the minis for people with thick hair. I would go by what other sizes reviewers recommend. These could work probably but you would need more is my guess. Fine hair girls, we have the perfect accessory for our hair type with these minis. Check out Youtube for how to ideas, they are awesome and I could not live without them and I just got them!</li>
    <li> I have thick very wavy long hair, which never wants to stay up (even in those rubber covered hairbands mean for sports).  But screwing a few of these in a bun will keep my hair up all day.  I have the larger version and the smaller.  The larger I use for a full hair pin-up without a hairband at all (even just 1 or 2 will hold it up).  These I use if I want a neat bun after making a ponytail, or if I want to create several smaller buns near the nape of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to learn - just take a bit of practice. Sometimes I do need a bobby pin or two to hold down pieces sticking out -- but that may be more of a curly/wavy hair problem.</li>
    <li> Got rid of all my old bobby pins-these are great for thick, long hair.  I only need one or two to secure a twist or top knot.</li>
    <li> I have long, very straight hair. I did not get them in a bundle. Studs and another pins did not hold my hair. Only these spin pins hold my hair all day.</li>
    <li> Pro:  very easy to use, secure, stay in all day.  Does not pull hair.  I use to keep my shoulder-length thin/fine hair in a little bun for work.  They work great, and do not feel too tight - I get headaches if using a tight claw clip but these mini spin pins work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  none.</li>
