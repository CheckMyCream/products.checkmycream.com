      <li>I love this product it makes you hair soft, plus giving you great curls.  </li>

      <li>Put it on with your hair dripping wet to get the best results.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for naturally curly hair or chemically loosened curls.</li>
      <li>Try varied amounts to find the perfect fit, leave plenty of time to dry.</li>
      <li>This gem is a true find!</li>
      <li>Because of that, I needed to switch to products that didn&#x27;t need strong detergent to get them out of my hair (i.e. anything with silicone).  </li>
      <li>The strands are fine.</li>
      <li>Basically the best thing to do is apply half of about what you think that you will need.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend it and only gave this 4 instead of 3 stars because the smell is a really good one, AND because this product line is more conscientious about ingredients that are safe and environmentally friendly than Garnier Fructis.</li>
      <li>I really liked using this product and this pump container is very convenient and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Product is fantastic for curly hair.  </li>
      <li>but the quality is worth the price!</li>

      <li>Smells clean and feels like liquid silk</li>
      <li>I have tried for years to find the right products for my curly hair - haven&#x27;t we all?!</li>
      <li>This works great when hair is wet and will maintain the curl pattern throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s better to use the defining cream along with her whole line</li>
      <li>After transitioning to natural last May, I gave myself three months to try various recommended products and then settle on what I liked best.</li>
      <li>It also has a mild scent which doesn&#x27;t cling to your hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Although I did not purchase this item from Amazon, I would be remiss if I didn&#x27;t leave a review! Jane Carter Solution Curl Defining Cream is awesome! My curls, although short, are defined and soft. This cream smells great too. Initially, I used Kinky Curly, which was disasterous. This gem is a true find!</li>
    <li> This product is a counterfeit. I contacted Jane Carter Solutions and was informed that they don&#x27;t stand behind this product. The smell is different. It doesn&#x27;t feel the same as the authentic CDC. I will never purchase this product from a retailer ever again</li>
    <li> Did not work on my daughters curls.  Her hair was even drier after using this product.  also made her scalp flake</li>
    <li> I have thick coarse curly hair. I bought this product hoping to help my hair. My hair gets very frizzy and this stuff made the frizz go away. My curls are more defined. My hair doesn&#x27;t get fluffier and bigger. It isn&#x27;t sticky or have the dreaded alcohol feel. When I wash it out my hair feels soft.</li>
    <li> I love all of the ingredients in this product --- it is one of the very few all-natural curl defining products.  It also smells great, but I wish the jar was a little bigger for the price</li>
    <li> I was just experimenting to find the right twist set product for my grade of hair --- this was not it. Initially it smells like fruit loops, but when hair is dry it just smells like unfresh, needing to be washed hair even though it&#x27;s just been washed on the same day. If it works for you, this is a great seller - it ships fast.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  It holds my curls and doen&#x27;t leave my hair feeling crunchy or tacky.  I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped for curl definition and separation.</li>
    <li> I am an African-American woman with 4B/4C combination hair. This product is excellent. People are giving it low reviews, because they have the wrong expectations! Please stop- sit down- and take several seats! (kidding of course) I&#x27;m sure women with similar hair texture are looking for what I &#x27;stopped&#x27; looking for- a product that will give me curls. If your hair texture is kinky-coily (4B/4C) a cream will NOT give you curls...I&#x27;m sorry. Shed your tears &amp; have a funeral for that thought. I was sad too. Embrace your kinky-coily hair girl! For those with lose curl patterns this curl defining cream with define their curls. But for us kinky-coily girls.........it has another benefit- so don&#x27;t give up hope just yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your a kinky-coily sister such as myself this product still has amazing benefits. It is the BEST moisturizer I have come across. Trust me- I&#x27;ve wasted enough money for the both of us honey! When included in a good hair regimen Ms. Jane Carter will keep your hair moisturized- which is critical. This is the only curl defining cream I&#x27;ve found that does that for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regimen: I usually co-wash (wash my hair with conditioner instead of shampoo b/c that helps it to retain moisture). I use the LOC METHOD. LOC &#x3D; liquid, oil, cream. My liquid is always water. If I&#x27;m moisturizing my TWA (tinnie-winnie-afro) on a non-wash day I spritz my hair with a water bottle that has a little extra virgin cold pressed olive oil. For my OIL I use avocado  oil (Sometimes I use olive oil, coconut oil, or jojoba oil). My hair loves those oils. You can figure out what works best for you. Now for my CREAM I use Ms. Carter&#x27;s Curl Defining Cream. Do this and poof- dry hair no more. Warning- if you have lose curls this will be too much moisture for your hair. This doesn&#x27;t take long. I have everything below my sink. Not to confuse you, but I make my own body butter with natural oils and usually use it in combination with my avocado oil......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last piece of advice.....IF YOU HAVE TIGHT KINKY-COILY HAIR EMBRACE IT! IT&#x27;S BEAUTIFUL! Stop trying to do what women with lose curls do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t even charge you for this information.... you&#x27;re welcome! HaHae of advice.....IF YOU HAVE TIGHT KINKY-COILY HAIR EMBRACE IT! IT&#x27;S BEAUTIFUL! Stop trying to do what women with lose curls do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t even charge you for this information.... you&#x27;re welcome! HaHa</li>
    <li> This is the only curl defining cream that I have used that truly defines my curls and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or dry it out. My stylist uses this product on all of her clients and it works perfectly on every hair type.</li>
    <li> Gave this one star instead of 0 because I appreciate the natural ingredients, however, I bought this to moisturizer my hair and to reduce frizz. I was hoping it would leave my curls soft and shiny without being greasy. It left my hair dull and while it didn&#x27;t look greasy it did not look shiny. Too expensive as a leave in cream that does not do what I need.</li>
    <li> Product was very good just a little bit to expensive for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really gives my hair a curl definition and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Great for stretching out curls!! Curls last for days.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Left my hair with white flakes and no curls. the curls only existed when my hair is wet otherwise it just frizzes.</li>
    <li> I had tried another product recommended by my hair dresser. This product leaves the hair very sod and shiny with no residue. My hair does still shrink because of how dry it is. I get many complements on the smell of my hair. It smells citrusy fresh.Best of all it is a natural product. I love all of her products.</li>
    <li> Smells clean and feels like liquid silk</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;m new to the natural approach, and this product is fabulous. I wet my hair completely, then I rake my fingers through with the product. Try varied amounts to find the perfect fit, leave plenty of time to dry. Downside, it takes a long time to dry, although I haven&#x27;t tried using a hairdryer with it...</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair from drying out.  Really helps to seal my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Simply the best curl defining.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE this Jane Carter Curl Defining Cream..  I will be purchasing this item very soon.</li>
    <li> defines curl very well</li>
    <li> The product works very well. It enhances the curls in my hair without hardening it which is one issue I&#x27;ll run into with using these types of products.</li>
    <li> So I wanted to finish the entire jar before I made a review. I will not repurchase this product. I don&#x27;t know how to classify my hair as 4a,b,orc but I know it is 3 different textures. My hair is thick but soft and dense almost like cotton. The strands are fine. I first tried this as a wash and go and that was a disaster. My hair came out very dry with no sheen with this product. If I use less of the product I don&#x27;t get much curl definition. I have tried the wash and go with dropping wet hair and damp hair. No success.twist outs/braid outs: so I do get definition but my hair comes out dry and I have to use a lot of moisturizer with this product. I have tried using different amounts of the product in orderto find the right method but my twist outs and braid outs don&#x27;t last more than two days. Twists shrink the next day with this product and there is little sheen. Maybe it&#x27;s better to use the defining cream along with her whole line but that&#x27;s too expensive for me. I don&#x27;t like the smell. It&#x27;s herbal light and lemony but not in a good way for me.Bottom line I feel like there are other products out there that will give better results</li>
    <li> This product is great for curly hair. Put it on with your hair dripping wet to get the best results. Goes on white but will slowly fade away.</li>
    <li> So I have 3c/4a fine hair and this definitely does define my curls and combats the shrinkage some. It&#x27;s a little too heavy for my thin tresses and the shrinkage returns within a day. It smells ok, which is really important to me. I like it. It&#x27;s not my everyday product but this is really a go to for my wash and wear and when I want my curlies tamed.</li>
    <li> This has been the only product that defines my thin hair.  It gives it a fuller look and the girls last for days.  It even feels bouncy and swingy.  Extra bonus no frizz and some compliments.  I purchased from Whole Foods but just placed an order through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well on my recently short curly hair. it maintains your curls and that&#x27;s a plus for me. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this cream for my daughter hair. Their hair is course, and it did not seem to define any curls in their hair. It did not even seem to moisturize their hair either. Not sure if I seen any benefits. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Only worked well if I finger twisted my curls. I twirled small sections around my fingers and my curls were defined then and only then. Better for looser curls. I have 3c/4a mixture.</li>
    <li> The absolute best!  I use this when doing the two-strand twist.  I like to use it on slightly damp hair.  I detangle then use a decent amount on the ends and a little along the rest of the hair then twist.  My hair comes out soft, defined and moisturized.  Frizz is minimal as well.  I really love this product.</li>
    <li> I got this my curl defining creme within the time frame they specified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was carefully packaged with bubble wrap and packing foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the product is slightly more porous than the first one I bought (in a store) but all in all, it works just as well.</li>
    <li> After trying several products to enhance my curls, Jane Carter is the only product that keeps my curls soft and my hair shiny and healthy. I also use Jane Carter leave in conditioner and apply the curl defining cream to my wet hair. After hand styling my hair, I leave it to air dry when I&#x27;m in a rush or I&#x27;d use my blow dry diffuser to remove the excess water.</li>
    <li> This product is great for people who are transitioning from relaxer to natural hair or just as a great moisturizer. For natural hair it brings out the curl and waves in your hair with a small amount of build up. It does not leave your hair stiff or crunchy like other curly wave products.  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good curly wave moisturizer. It also smells great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product that can tame my hair frizz in Florida&#x27;s humidity.&lt;br /&gt;Postal service problems but this seller made sure I was satisfied.</li>
    <li> It defines curls but it requires something else to help with moisture; I don&#x27;t like using a lot of products, I prefer one that gets the job done. I only put about a dime size in my entire head while it is soaking wet and then shake out to make curls form. I have very thick curly hair; people that I consider to have thick hair say that my hair is a lot thicker than theirs. I am man of color and this is my first time allowing my hair to grow. I wish I didn&#x27;t have to by woman&#x27;s hair products but they are what works for me, not axe etc.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Wow, I can&#x27;t even begin to get across how well it works. All you need to do is wet it and it reactivates it! S&amp;*t is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous anti-frizz and curl defining creams from Sephora and Whole Foods Body here in NYC. So far, this cream is the only one that works. Other brands leave my hair frizzier and drier or else they irritate my scalp. Seems like from what other reviewers write, it&#x27;s really a gamble as to whether or not a product will work with an individual&#x27;s hair. I wish I had more than one option for taming my wild, frizzy, dry hair - but for now this is the only option that actually makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way and the product can easily be revitalized by lightly dampening the hair on subsequent days.</li>
    <li> I love the result that I get from using the curl defining cream. Love it...Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been natural for over 12 years! I love this leave in it defines my curls and moisturizes my hair. I would give it a shot and see how you like it for your hair! I put Kemi oil on top of it.</li>
    <li> I mix this product with Jane Carter&#x27;s Curl Condition and Sculpt in equal portions scrunching it into my sulfite free freshly shampooed/co-washed wet/damp hair (Deva Curl Style, i.e. with my head upside down).  I then t-shirt scrunch out the excess moisture.  I sleep with my hair still damp.  It dries overnight into bouncy shiny ringlets, requiring little fuss with the muss in the am.  It gives me good results for up to 4 days after I first use it.  I just lightly refresh my hair daily with a salt spray, or another spray on refresher.  My hair is 2c (temple area ) through 3b.  I love Jane Carter!</li>
    <li> leaves hair dry and brittle, looking for a product to leave hair soft and moisturized and define curls.  not crazy about this product</li>
    <li> My hair LOVES this stuff. I&#x27;ve been going through a lot of leave-in and styling cream and I gotta say nothing makes my hair look better. I can even go a few days without rinsing my hair out and even looks better in my hair after the 2nd or 3rd day. I put it on when my hair is still wet after the shower and let it air dry. Sometimes after I use leave-in, sometimes without it.</li>
    <li> The product seems to of changed over time. The first time I got it the container was much bigger. I assume Jane has changed the size. Consistancy has changed also, imo. Could be several reasons why and have nothing to do with Jane.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Leaves my hair soft and wavy without looking fake. Looks healthier.</li>
    <li> Use this for my daughter who has &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; hair, works great with defining curls. One of the best products that we have used!</li>
    <li> After a friend referred us to get the Jane Carter Curl Defining Cream because it works, we purchase the Leave-in Conditioner and the Curl Defining Cream. After applying this product to the baby&#x27;s hair for the first time we simply just use the phrase \\&quot;you smell and feel like Jane Carter!!! (referring to the product). Our main issue was detangling the hair and keeping it soft and moist. Well, unlike many low cost products that advertise that they do just that, the result after using those products were nothing compare to the phenomenon result of the Jane Carter Curl Defining Cream. As for JC Leave-in Conditioner (spray), to us there was nothing amazing about it once it was use just alone. however, it worked wonderful after and/or before applying the Curl Defining Cream. Hence, the baby&#x27;s natural hair is curly, we wanted something that would help keep its natural state through-out the day and even after sleeping on it w/o frizz; JC Curl Defining Cream did just that. We are hooked.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for naturally curly hair or chemically loosened curls. Your hair is left shiny and soft to the touch. The product is absorbed by into your hair and does not leave residue. It also has a mild scent which doesn&#x27;t cling to your hair.</li>
    <li> Product is fantastic for curly hair.  Soft texture and curls instead of frizz - highly recommend</li>
    <li> This solution works for me when I have watered it down a bit during application. It does elongate my curls, but if I put too much then my hair feels thick and can get pretty tangled. Basically the best thing to do is apply half of about what you think that you will need.</li>
    <li> Had been looking for a good product, I love this product. Will order more in the future when I run out. .</li>
    <li> It let curl pattern of my hair be more defined</li>
    <li> Great product. Gives additional body to my hair and enhances the curls</li>
    <li> I have tried for years to find the right products for my curly hair - haven&#x27;t we all?! - and I have finally settled on this, in combination with another Jane Carter product (Condition and Sculpt liquid).  My curls are somewhere between 3a and 3b and tend to be weighed down easily.  I also stopped using shampoo and conditioner on my hair about six months ago (in favor of a roughly weekly baking soda wash and green tea/cider vinegar rinse).  Because of that, I needed to switch to products that didn&#x27;t need strong detergent to get them out of my hair (i.e. anything with silicone).  This cream is the answer.  When I first tried it, I found it hard to evenly distribute it through my hair without using too much... so I tried the Condition and Sculpt liquid and had the same problem for the opposite reason - it was too liquid-y and I ended up using too much and weighing my hair down.  Now I mix the two together in roughly equal parts and I have the perfect hair product.  No overwhelming scents to conflict with my perfume, either.  Best of all, there are no nasty chemical ingredients here.  Hooray!!</li>
    <li> The best curl creeam I ever used</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes you hair soft, plus giving you great curls.  The cream smells good, you only need a small amount of cream on your hair.</li>
    <li> I used it and after reading all the comments about this product I thought it would be amazing in my hair, well, it wasn&#x27;t. My hair ended up really dry, hard and puffy! I&#x27;m not  happy! But, it does smell delicious and it works for my mom&#x27;s hair, she is using it now, maybe it doesn,t work for my tupe of hair</li>
    <li> Th s is one hair product that works on my thick, wavy/curly hair. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I agree with the earlier reviews of this product in Allure, Elle, and other magazines.... this is the best curl defining cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have biracial girls and it&#x27;s hard to know what to put in their hair that won&#x27;t smell too strongly, that will also keep the fly away hair around the edges looking at least naturally curly if not laid down by the end of the school day.  This doesn&#x27;t do it as well as Garnier Fructis products I&#x27;m finding.  But there are SO many variants of black/white hair that it&#x27;s hard to say don&#x27;t try it.  I&#x27;d recommend it and only gave this 4 instead of 3 stars because the smell is a really good one, AND because this product line is more conscientious about ingredients that are safe and environmentally friendly than Garnier Fructis.</li>
    <li> The whole Jane Carter collection is just wonderful! I mostly love it because of its natural ingredients, I am trying to live overall a more natural life style, and the products fits it perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I am of mixed race, half black half white, and trying to grow out my hair without doing &amp;#34;the big chop&amp;#34; after years of using chemicals. Once I started using it in conjunction with other products in this collection , it seemed to bring out my natural curl more, which I have never scene before ( as long as I can remember my hair has always been heat treated to make it straight).&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was a little cheaper but the quality is worth the price!</li>
    <li> I used this for twist and twist out. Leaves my hair very soft and a little goes a long way, it is not greasy and it is not heavy. I really liked using this product and this pump container is very convenient and easy to use.</li>
    <li> IT DOES WONDERS TO MY CURLY HAIR. MY WASH AND GO LASTED 2 WEEKS AFTER I APPLIED IT. WILL PURCHASED AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Light and non greasy! A little goes a long way!! Never flaky and great price to quantity and quality ratio.</li>
    <li> I am giving this curling cream 4 stars because I still have to blow dry my hair, but having said that,it is the best product I have ever used. My hair isn&#x27;t crispy and I have amazing curl definition. I don&#x27;t know how they make this stuff, but it really does work. I have been struggling with my very frizzy hair for more than 30 years now and it feels good to buy a product that makes my life a little easier. Thank you Jane Carter Solutions.</li>
    <li> It is much cheaper than purchasing it at the store or directly through the manufacturer.  I love getting a discounted rate!</li>
    <li> Optimum Effectiveness with wet hair. Upon application it protects curly drying hair while moisturizing.  Hair looks rich and healthy constantly.</li>
    <li> This works great when hair is wet and will maintain the curl pattern throughout the day.  However, it builds up if you have to use it on subsequent days and you have to wash your hair more often.  That said, it seems to really condition the hair and leave it soft.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair feeling soft and bouncy, not hard and crunchy. I did notice that it takes a lot of the product to keep my hair moisturized, so maybe pairing this product with one of Shea Moisture&#x27;s hair products will benefit those of you with dry hair.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for kids with sensitive scalp problems. It works great on my grandkids&#x27;hair. Their hair is very manageable with this product.</li>
    <li> I guess don&#x27;t neglect the blow drying step b/c your hair will shrink if your hair is tightly coiled. It will still feel soft and manageable though.</li>
    <li> After transitioning to natural last May, I gave myself three months to try various recommended products and then settle on what I liked best. I was determined not to become a product junkie. My two go-to products became Jane Carter&#x27;s Nourish and Shine and this, the Curling Cream. The texture is light, not sticky, and the fragrance is so pleasant. I use it to do my twist outs and braid outs, and there is never any flaking or residue. Also, a little goes a long way. I buy the pump jar and it lasts for many months- 6 or so? As for price, I have learned that most of the natural products without the harmful ingredients are priced in the same range as the Jane Carter Solution stuff, so I buy this on sale at Whole Foods when I can or on Amazon if the price is around the same, and I keep on stepping. It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This product really transformed my hair. After washing, I would just grease my hair with this and I has great looking hair.</li>
    <li> Love this Product!!! This is a great product for defining your curls. I have tried several but this one I get the best results. The only problem with this product is that it leaves your hair feeling funny to the touch that&#x27;s why I use a hair moisturiser along with it .&lt;br /&gt;Great buy !!!</li>
    <li> I have been natural for almost 20 years and i love how this works with my hair.  My curls are very defined and even keep for multiple days.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! It really defined my curls and left them feeling soft!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for curly hair styling products that do not contain tons of harmful chemicals and that still perform well.  I wasn&#x27;t having any luck until I saw the Jane Carter products at a trade show I was attending.  They gave me a sample and I was hooked.  It defines curls, but doesn&#x27;t give that &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; curl like most other products.</li>
    <li> Love the curly results! Love that it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky. Love the softness after applying and drying.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works well and when I rinse it out, my hair is soft and well conditioned.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, but not at all curl defining for me. Once my hair started to dry, the curl definition vanished.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Excellent ingredients, and does define like it says.  Basically gives me nice waves, and healthy for the hair.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. I have lots of thick long curly hair that can get &amp;#34;woofy,&amp;#34; especially in summer humidity. This product tames the wild beast but exaggerates the curl I love.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this product, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect any curl defining benefits for African Americans with 4a-c hair types. I haven&#x27;t had the heart to toss it out because it was so pricey. I will use it on occasion to hydrate my hair when I want to wash it but am not going out and don&#x27;t feel like doing much else - it was great when I was home sick for a few days. On days like that, you can also use more sparingly...which could also be annoying if you want it gone but don&#x27;t want to toss it :).</li>
