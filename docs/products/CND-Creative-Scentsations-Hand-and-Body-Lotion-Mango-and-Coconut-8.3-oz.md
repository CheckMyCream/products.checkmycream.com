Was my go to lotion for mani/pedis Was shipped fast and in perfect condition. Okay fun stuff.. First the smell is absolutely amazing. It has the perfect coconut mango thing...lol..close your eyes and your on a island someplace relaxing.  I hate coconut or and product that smell of it. But this! Omg match made in heaven!!..I use this every single day. It&#x27;s so moisturizing without the greasy feeling. My hands look hydrated which means younger looking. I tan every day and use this lotion to keep my skin soft smooth and healthy.  My kids also use this lotion. They love the smell. A definite must have. Im reordering more. I have to keep my supply up.</li>
