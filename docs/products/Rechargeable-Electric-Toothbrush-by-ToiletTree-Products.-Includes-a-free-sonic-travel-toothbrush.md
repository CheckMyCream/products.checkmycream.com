<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I desperately wanted to write an amazing review for this product. But just after a few months, the brush isn&#x27;t working as it originally did. The motor sounds questionable and I have had to revert back to using an antique, hand held, regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Broke after a couple months. The head of the toothbrush would get stuck too and pinch the inside of my cheeks when brushing.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these.  The vibrating travel toothbrush is nice but more of a gimmick.  The oscillating toothbrush is effective and powerful.  Battery life is excellant.</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush for almost 6 months and the battery started to wear out and the maximal charge had decreased considerably. I contacted ToiletTree about the issue and they sent me a replacement without any hassle whatsoever. They definitely keep true to their 365-day guarantee. Thanks to Kelly Parisi at ToiletTree for all the help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual brush, it was a delight to first use. The power is incredible and my teeth have never gotten clean so fast. The head of the brush can come off while brushing if you do a bunch of swirly motions with your wrist, but there is absolutely no need to do that and anyone complaining about it is probably doing damage to their gums with all that movement. In all, it&#x27;s a great product and a great company and the travel toothbrush is a nice addition that I took advantage of on my recent vacation.</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush now for about 3 months (purchased August 14th). At first I loved it so much. It was very fairly priced and made my teeth feel far cleaner than a regular toothbrush. The sensitive setting was perfect for me, and the little stops every 30 secs really helped me to make sure I was getting in a full 2 min cleaning (I think I tended to skimp on mornings where I was rushed on time). I loved that it came with 2 heads with different band colors. I even let my boyfriend have one of the heads to use when he sleeps over at my place. Trying it out was enough to convince him to get the same model just a week later.    Sadly, I noticed about 2 weeks ago that the power of the brush was diminishing. I moved it to a different outlet hoping that my old apartment building&#x27;s dwindling electrical wiring was the culprit, but such was not the case. This morning I attempted to brush my teeth after it had been on the charger for at least a day straight, and I got about 30 seconds at half the power of the sensitive setting, until the buzzing was almost non-existent after about a minute of time.    I feel like I must have a defected product, because my boyfriend uses his toothbrush an equal amount and has had no issues. In fact, he just ordered more heads for his. If there is any way the seller can help me to rectify this problem, I&#x27;d be very appreciative, as I did really like this toothbrush until it stopped performing. I&#x27;d even be happy to provide a youtube video of our two brushes next to each other to show how poorly mine is functioning in comparison. I&#x27;m afraid that till then, I&#x27;ll have to go back to my crappy manual toothbrush :/      Update: Just a day after writing this review, ToiletTree Products reached out to me and offered to send me a new toothbrush free of charge. I am really pleased with how amazing their customer service is, and I can&#x27;t wait to update my review with my hopefully new working toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I bought this tooth brush 5 months ago. For the last month it has been useless to me. It constantly shuts off in the middle of brushing. It shows it&#x27;s still on, but does not work. I have to press the button to turn it completely off and turn it back on again only for it to quit on me again. The battery isn&#x27;t faulty because it will work when just left on. It&#x27;s only when brushing and pressure is applied to the brush head that it stops. I don&#x27;t brush hard so there is no reason for it to stop working. I like the travel brush, but the main unit is going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I love it so much I bought 2 of them, afterwards you feel like you just left the dentist</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for for my wife.  After about 3 months the motor began to fail.  She would have to turn it off and on a couple of times to get it running again.  Eventually, she dropped it by accident and the little pin that holds the brush head broke which rendered it useless.  But by then she didn&#x27;t care too much as it was failing anyway.  She did, however, contact, two times via their website, TolietTree to inform them of her experience, but she never heard back from them.  So, there you have it. We don&#x27;t recommend this product, not only because it&#x27;s a poorly made product, (I see my wife is not the only one that had troubles) but their customer service is non-existen    UPDATE TO MY REVIEW - I was contacted by the president of ToiletTree products.  He offered to send me a replacement rechargeable toothbrush at no expense.  Naturally, I accepted.  I can tell you that my wife says right off the bat it&#x27;s markedly more powerful than the first one.  After a couple of glitches, it seems that maybe the problem is solved.  I will keep you posted as to how long the life span turns out to be.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is junk made in China. DO NOT buy it. Poor quality and it stopped working after 8 months. I&#x27;m calling the manufacturer for a refund. Stick with a more trusted brand.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t recall why my husband said he didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Initially LOVED this toothbrush, bur after just a few months approx 90 days it died!!! I&#x27;ve had other electric brushes for YEARS...VERY disappointed!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only item I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Amazon that I&#x27;ve been sooooo disappointed!!</li>
    <li> lasted 5 months appears switch that turns on/off failed.</li>
    <li> This product has two pre set features to accomidate those of us with sensitive teeth and gums. The brush is soft and gentle, yet effective. There is a sleek and comfortable feel that is suitable for anyone. There is an internal timing mechanism that is very convenient. It is very simple to assemble and recharge. As an added bonus, the product comes with an electronic travel brush. The nuisance of purchasing a new toothbrush while traveling has been completely eliminated. Overall I rate this product 10/10.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s okay but I prefer Braun.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience using an electric toothbrush.  I had been told in the past that I brush way too hard on both my gums and teeth, so using an electric toothbrush would be good for me.  I really was surprised at how well it cleaned my teeth.  I liked the fact that the toothbrush is much longer than a manual toothbrush, which allows me to get to my wisdom teeth and back molars with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stated above, the auto-timer is set for 2 minutes of brushing.  Every 30 seconds, the toothbrush pauses letting you know to move on to a different section of your mouth.  I never realized that I was not brushing nearly as long as I should have been.  I find that my teeth and gums no longer hurt from brushing too hard.  The ToiletTree toothbrush gives a great cleaning, I feel similar to that at your dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recharge base is very small.  The only downfall of this product that I see is that I feel that the toothbrush could sit a bit sturdier on the base as I find it easily knocked over.  The toothbrush it&#x27;s self is very lightweight and comfortable in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that that if you are in the market for a new Electronic Toothbrush, the ToiletTree is the way to go. It is probably one of the lesser known toothbrush brands on the market, but in my opinion, one of the best. Currently it is priced at just $49.95 with free shipping on Amazon and I doubt you will find anything to compare cheaper than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ToiletTree also offers a 100% 365-day money back guarantee if you are unhappy with your results or product!</li>
    <li> best oral b tooth brush I&#x27;ve ever used ,works great ,made by toiletry,i would recommend this tooth brush to anyone,i really like it ,good job,thanks,don</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time and as described.  This one of the best value for the dollar products I have ever experienced.  The very first time I used the home unit, I was amazed with the results;  cleaner teeth than ever, having used only a manual tooth brush for most of my life.  The technology assigned to these units is very effective and works perfectly.  My dentist suggested another brand, the Sonicare, at a much higher cost; but I am not a easy subject.  I do all my own homework with any product before blindly following anyone elses recommendations.  I always give priority to generic brands, not ready to pay for those highly advertised companies overhead:  after all, everyone knows that all brands are made in china anyway.  I will happily continue to use these brushes until they stop performing.  I personally like the rotational brush better than the vibrational, and get cleaner results.. My only wish is that Toilet Tree would provide a rotational travel size also, but if they offered a ten star rating, they would get it from me!</li>
    <li> shipping was quick and I&#x27;m happy with the toothbrush and its performance after a few uses. It seems to be well made and I don&#x27;t have any complaints. I think it&#x27;s an improvement over the Oral B Vitality it replaced.</li>
    <li> One brush head broke after first week. Now three brush heads have broken and motor shuts off or won&#x60;t rotate at all.</li>
    <li> I used to be a Sonicair user for the longest time.  well, my latest SC finally died and had to replace it.  This one cleans so much better than the SC and it comes with a second brush!  brush heads don&#x27;t cost $30 each either.  highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Could not be happier. Major difference from a manual brush.</li>
    <li> My  husband was advised to use an electric tooth brush by his dentist to stop gingivitis as surgery would ensue if he didn&#x27;t work on better cleaning and regular flossing.  The brush works great and you don&#x27;t feel it necessary to press hard against your teeth to get a sparkling, clean, smooth feeling.  Excellent reviews and the much lower price compared to other name brand devices made it ideal for us to purchase not only the tooth brush, but  replacement brushes  and the wonderful  oral irrigator as well! ( Some bickering over Toilet Tree and other name brand products happened as Toilet Tree isn&#x27;t that well known.)  My husband&#x27;s dental checkup one week later resulted in a perfect score so we are extremely pleased with these products and he is now a diligent user because they work!  Having the units rechargeable and ready to go is great with the free travel battery operated brush a  big bonus.  The products are sturdy and the directions for use of all the items are simple and straight forward.  We only hope  that these products remain affordable in future as having dental work done sure isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even last me a whole year before it died. No way to change the battery. If you only want an electric toothbrush for a few months then this is for you. The portable tooth brush got me a few months more usage, but I&#x27;d suggest finding another toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an Oral B Braun model with battery failure.  I priced a new one and found it was ridiculously high.  I happened to come across a recommendation for the ToiletTree toothbrush and the reviews and price sold me.  As a bonus, it comes with a travel model, which the Oral B doesn&#x27;t have.  I like that the ToiletTree brush has a wider base below the brush head and traps any leftover toothpaste and water from reaching the handle.  The Oral B would always drip to the bottom and make a mess on the charger base no matter how long I rinsed it.  My only dislike is that I have receding gums and tooth sensitivity and have used the Oral B sensitive brush heads for years.  Like the Oral B, the sensitive mode on the ToiletTree is slower, but not softer.  If I could get a softer brush head, I would definitely give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m literally in love with my new toothbrush. Every time I brush my teeth now I feel like I just visited the dentist. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a brighter, spotless smile.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great electric toothbrush at a great price you shouldn&#x27;t miss this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build Quality-&lt;br /&gt;The ToiletTree electric toothbrush is a beautifully built piece of hardware. The base is solid with a matte finish which make it comfortable hold. It&#x27;s ergonomic design and perfect weight distribution allows you to maneuver the toothbrush comfortably without slipping. The device is light enough to be comfortable but heavy enough to feel substantial in your hand. The power button is not raised so it doesn&#x27;t get in your way when you hold the brush. ToiletTree&#x27;s brush heads are solid and twist on to the base with ease. The device is waterproof and easy to clean off after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging dock is solid a with a little pin that charges the base. It&#x27;s bottom has four rubber pads to keep the dock from sliding. The brush slides loosely on the pin, but sits sturdy on the dock. I don&#x27;t know how long it takes to charge, or how long the battery lasts, because I always just put it back on the charger after use.&lt;br /&gt;5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning-&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush has two settings, &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; [regular] and &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; [for sensitive teeth]. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth so my review will cover the regular setting. The brush head is circular and oscillates with enough force to feel it work, but not too powerful as to hurt your gums. I like the size of the brush head as it is perfect to individually clean each tooth. This toothbrush persuades you to brush in a particular way, which I appreciate. Every 30 seconds the brush stops for moment, which at first I though was a malfunction. After brushing a few times though I realized it was my signal to move to the next section of my mouth. Now, I brush in quadrants which allows me to spend the perfect amount of time brushing. After two minutes the brush shuts off. I&#x27;ve used other electric brushes before and they don&#x27;t give you give you any warning or shut off when the cycle is over, they just buzzto indicate the two minutes is up. Can&#x27;t say enough about the brushing cycle or the power of this toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design-&lt;br /&gt;ToiletTree not only made a great functioning toothbrush, but they made a product that looks great in my bathroom. The black finish is very stylish as is the hourglass shape of the brush base. As I said earlier, the power button is flush with the base, which makes the design look professional. On the bottom of the base are 3 lights, which only go on when in use; Clean, Soft, and a battery symbol. Clean is the regular setting, soft is for sensitive teeth, and the battery lights dull red when charging. Like I said, I always keep my toothbrush charging so the red light is always on, but it&#x27;s subtle enough not to stand out. My favorite design element is the charging dock which has a rippling water effect. It&#x27;s a nice modern touch that looks great on my sink.&lt;br /&gt;5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;For $50 your not going to find a better electric toothbrush. It will cost you at lest $20 dollars more for a low-end Sonicare, which won&#x27;t clean as well as the ToiletTree and doesn&#x27;t look half as nice.&lt;br /&gt;5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from its excellent style and performance, the ToiletTree electric toothbrush comes with a spare brush head and a travel brush. The travel brush is waterproof and runs on a AAA battery. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I turned it on and it seems powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy I picked this toothbrush. Its been a couple of weeks and (call me crazy) I already see a difference in my teeth. We&#x27;ll see after my next dentist visit.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Toilet Tree products simply work.  The price is right and the quality is good.</li>
    <li> Had written a nice review, toothbrush just DIED.  Bought it Jan. 26. 2014 and it no longer charges as of today.  You would be better off with ANY other brand!!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does a great job!  Love the sleek look as well.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> So far so good! It arrived on time but I have only had it for less than a week so I will follow-up on my review at a later time.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has very poor quality. Made in China.&lt;br /&gt;Water was dumped everywhere. I bought it for my husband. He doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> My first electric toothbrush and I am loving it . The travel size, it&#x27;s perfect for any trip and that is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Great buy I have braces and electronic toothbrush is a must. I really do not know how to get replacement brushes I wonder does the Phillips brush heads fit but great product</li>
    <li> I love that it has the 2 brush modes, clean and sensitive. I need the sensitive mode because if I brush too hard, my gums will bleed. We have always used brushed our teeth manually and I personally never thought there would be that much of difference in how my teeth felt using an electric toothbrush, BUT there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth felt so much cleaner, like I was able to get in all the crevices where a manual toothbrush cannot. I didn&#x27;t say anything to my husband and I waited to see if he said anything first...and he did! He said he felt as though his teeth were getting cleaner using the electric toothbrush also.</li>
    <li> A refreshingly excellent product! I had used a Phillips Sonicare user for many years and decided that I had enough of the high prices that Phillips charges for both their toothbrushes and replacement parts. I am very pleased with the quality and performance of my ToiletTree rechargeable toothbrush. My teeth are &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean and bright using a very small dollop of toothpaste, the toothbrush is easy to clean and store. All in all, a great buy!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush!  My mouth feels so fresh and clean after every brush!  I love that when you push too hard it stops, to let you know HEY, be easy!  Another amazing product!</li>
    <li> Works great.  charge lasts several days.  I prefer this over the sonicare I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is replaceable!  so that is a great bonus</li>
    <li> Do not buy this item, It stops every time I touch my teeth. It worked for two months and then just went to crap.</li>
    <li> Love this thing...the grip, the performance, battery life - does a great job and the freeby travel brush is a cool little extra - definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> The first toothbrush quit after two months.  I called the company and they shipped a replacement to me immediately.  The first one must have been defective because the new one is a lot more powerful and is working perfectly after 3 months.  I like the built in timer,  the aggressive action of the brush- and the warranty is terrific!</li>
    <li> Both the home and travel brushes do a great job brushing your teeth. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of theses toothbrushes eventhough I had previously read great reviews by others. This is a great value that anyone in he market for an electric toothbrush should buy. Update it is failing to operate after I bought replacement brush heads and is totally inoperable after 8 months of use. Do not buy this item!</li>
    <li> I love everything about my new electric toothbrush. Its super convenient and easy to use! Everyone should go out and get one! YAY&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine a more expensive electric toothbrush being better than this ToiletTree product. We&#x27;ve had it for several months and it is great. Your teeth really feel like a dental tech cleaned them and my gums are definitely in better shape than my old battery-powered toothbrush. Great choice and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I wish i could separate the main tooth brush from the travel one in this this review but since i can&#x27;t I&#x27;ll put both in here. Have used for 5 months now.  Main tooth brush - Just OK. Arrived without the instruction book but was promptly e-mailed one from customer service. Since the charging light never goes out and there is no full charge indicator you have to keep it plugged in and sitting out all the time.  Not good if you have limited space/receptacles. I have owned many electric toothbrushes before this one and it just feels different.The head oscillations do not feel nearly as smooth as my previous Oral B and seem inconsistent. Yes it does &#x27;fling&amp;#34; around far more  toothpaste/water (it is messier) than previous models but it doesn&#x27;t seem to impact cleaning capability. The fact that you have to twist the head on/off vice just pulling (like previous models I owned) is inconvenient but no big deal.  I have not had the problem (even once) of the head dislodging as others have reported. Just this week though the toothbrush shut off 2x on it&#x27;s own.  Started back up with no issue. Would not buy again but since I bought a bunch of replacement heads will keep using. Travel toothbrush - 5 Stars.  I travel extensively for business and this toothbrush is almost perfect. Smooth operation, adequate brush area, long battery life, small footprint.  The only improvement would be if the head could be replaced. It appears you have to but a new one. I probably have 6 weeks of on the road use and the head is still OK but will have to be replaced eventually. I would definitely recommend this to business travelers.</li>
    <li> Quit working after a few months. Power slowly drained then stopped after a few secs each time I brushed.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk. It started out just fine; however, about a month and a half (after return period, of course), the thing barely works. I could charge it from now to next year, and it barely runs. Basically, I bought a really expensive manual toothbrush. The $10 Oral B battery run toothbrushes are SO MUCH BETTER. That is what I am now using. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS.  UPDATE: After reading my review, seller reached out and gave me a full refund well after the 30 day Amazon return period, which I appreciate. So, if you are on the fence about buying this, you can rest assured that the seller stands behind the product. Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck than me...</li>
    <li> I really like this toothbrush.  It is sleek and really does the job right.  And the very first week I had a chance to use the travel brush.  It has a different head than the regular brush, but that is fine.  It really does a good job.  I now have a Toilet Tree for my to go bag and my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a week, but like it so far. It replaces a much more expensive one that I had for five years, which I rarely used. I just couldn&#x27;t get used to its high speed vibration. This one is more &#x27;calm.&#x27; My teeth do feel clean after brushing, and it gives some gum massage in the process. I&#x27;ve had no other experience with brushes in this price range so can&#x27;t compare otherwise. I&#x27;m going on a 5-day vacation this week and taking the travel brush with me. Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but with a fresh battery it buzzes away happily. Can&#x27;t think of any cons so far. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I liked it when I first purchased it, but now after a few months, it stops working and I have to keep pressing the start button to get it to start again and when it starts again it will run very slow, hoping I can finish brushing before it stops.</li>
    <li> This is the toothbrush I plan to use for the rest of my life, if it is offered that long. There is NO reason, to the best of my knowledge, for someone to spend more than said amount for a toothbrush. I don&#x27;t possibly see any other electronic toothbrush getting your teeth cleaner than this one. After using it, I don&#x27;t feel one spec of grit on my teeth.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year, and it still works like it did since day 1.  I also 100% support this company&#x27;s care for the customers. I had to reach out to them at one point because my toothbrush died (it was before they upgraded the battery in them), and they 100% took care of me and had VERY prompt and courteous service. They, literally, went above an beyond.  I can say with confidence that if you purchase this toothbrush, you won&#x27;t be disappointed...and if you are, the people at ToiletTree will take care of you. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Head won&#x27;t stay attached after only a few uses.    Too late to return it thru Amazon, now stuck with an appliance that is useless.    The removable/replaceable head rotates and then stops the turning of the brush.  I have to take it out of my mouth and twist the head to get it to work for a few more seconds, until the head comes loose again...then the rotating brush stops.    The unit I have is apparently flawed or cheaply made.  I would expect them all to fail in the same way after a fairly short time period.    9/26/14 Update:    I received the new unit from Steve and have been using it for a few weeks.  The head has stayed on, but the design really needs to be addressed at some time in the future; it&#x27;s just too iffy.    Additionally, the new unit is a lot stronger than the old one; not sure if I noticed it previously but the other one&#x27;s battery or motor had gotten weak.  This one is working much better.    I&#x27;ve upped my rating from 1 to 3 stars.  If this unit lasts and retains it&#x27;s vigor, I&#x27;ll come back and revise the review and rating again.</li>
    <li> My son was very excited to receive this toothbrush and give it a test drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have never had electric toothbrushes before, so this was definitely something new to try out. Sometimes, kids don’t like that vibrating feeling in their mouths from an electric toothbrush, but my son enjoyed it very much. He actually said he was, “Tired of having to brush his teeth manually and do all of that work.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His thoughts: This toothbrush was great to use to brush my teeth. Now instead of having to brush up and down, I only have to move it back and forth. I definitely recommend this toothbrush to everyone. My teeth feel clean when I am done using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a replacement head that was also included in the kit and a travel toothbrush for trips to Grandma’s house. All of these were added perks in his 11-year old eyes. You can never be too sure what kind of job kids will do brushing their teeth, but I think having an electric toothbrush makes it more effective and fun. He may be permanently switching over to electric for good after this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toilet Tree Products gave me an item for review purposes. I have no other connection to and have received no other compensation from Toilet Tree Products.</li>
    <li> As Advertised. Great Brush! And great travel brush too.</li>
    <li> Has delivered a great clean so far!!</li>
    <li> Good electric toothbrush for the price. Does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> When initially purchased, it was fine and did everything it was supposed to do.  Comfortable handle, ease in use and the best feature is the timer that signals when you need to switch out to the next section of brushing.  My biggest annoyance is that it stopped working after only a few months since I purchased it. Am now back to the manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought the replacement heads and now am reluctant to buy another set.  ToiletTree, please ensure that the product has some longevity.</li>
    <li> This is my second ToiletTree product. I have owned their personal skin care face scrubber for over a year now and it is of excellent quality. So when it came time to purchase an electric toothbrush and one of my choices was from ToiletTree I knew it would be the right choice and it is. Again, high quality materials. The sleek black design fits well with my bathroom décor. I currently have been using a spin brush battery operated toothbrush which worked well but I was getting tired with the changing of batteries and the inconstant speed of the brushing. New batteries, the toothbrush was almost too fast and as the batteries wore down so did the speed. I thought that can&#x27;t be good for overall dental health. I have only owned the new electric toothbrush for a few days and I already feel a big difference in how much cleaner my teeth feel. It is the constant correct speed and the toothbrush head that gets into all the cracks and crevasses that make for super clean teeth and gums. It is interesting how it runs for a total of 2 minutes of brushing time and then shuts off, with a slight pause every 30 seconds to signal the user to move to a new quadrant. Never even heard of that before but apparently dentists recommend a optimal brushing time of 2 minutes every time we brush. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but it also comes with a separate travel sized battery operated toothbrush. I would highly recommend this toothbrush for it&#x27;s great looks, quality of materials and clean sparkly teeth.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace an old electronic toothbrush and it&#x27;s been amazing so far. The brush itself costs as much as the replacement heads for my last toothbrush. For that price, you get the toothbrush, a replacement head, and a travel toothbrush (which I haven&#x27;t tried yet). The brush is incredibly light which was a nice change from my last brush. The brushing is a little aggressive but there is a sensitive setting also that tones it down a little bit in case this bothers your gums. The only thing I would change is a way to tell how much battery power there is. However, since there is a travel brush, there&#x27;s really no issue with me just leaving it plugged in most of the time.</li>
    <li> Pretty good item. If it will last a couple of years, then this would be perfect. One problem is with the little plastic color bands, they both broke in putting them on.... They should put them on each head when then make them.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Only thing I do not like is the brush head does not stay on tightly. Also water gets inside the head and slightly sprays out.  So if you are wearing a shirt you will most likely have small white toothpaste marks on it.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a nice travel toothbrush which takes a single double AA battery. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 6 months ago as a replacement when my Sonic Care 1500 started acting up. When it arrived it only did a passable job, but I thought to myself &amp;#34;That&#x27;s what you get when you replace a $150 toothbrush with a $50 knock off.&amp;#34; After using it for two or three weeks I took my Sonic Care apart and got it working again. Two days ago my Sonic Care died for good and I pulled the ToiletTree back out to use. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!!! Apparently, sitting under my bathroom sink, back in the original box, not being used it too much wear and tear for this piece of crap to handle! The spin brush spins just fine until you actually place it into contact with a tooth, then it just STOPS! You have to disconnect the brush attachment from the handle and reattach it again to get it to start spinning again, and it of course STOPS AGAIN as soon as you press it against a tooth! A spin toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t spin when you press it against your teeth! Great job Guys! Way to have your finger on the pulse of customer satisfaction!! After clicking &#x27;submit&#x27; I will be throwing this &#x27;product&#x27; in the trash where it belongs and heading out to Sam&#x27;s Club to purchase a new Sonic Care. While shelling out a $150 for a toothbrush hurts, shelling out $150 for a brush that will last 5 or 6 years makes a whole lot more sense that spending the $50 I paid for this piece of CRAP! My advice, if you&#x27;re looking at purchasing a product and realize it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;ToiletTree&amp;#34;, save your money!</li>
    <li> The brush is a great size that can really get into the cracks as well as surround the entire tooth for optimal cleaning. The bristles are super high quality, and while soft, still firm enough to really deliver a deep, thorough cleaning. I tend to push to hard on my toothbrush, always have, so I love that it stops for a second to let you know your applying too much pressure, so you don&#x27;t end up hurting your gums and teeth. The ToiletTree Electrical toothbrush is also ergonomical and waterproof so you can use it in the shower too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that my toothbrush came with an extra head, as well as a smaller electrical travel brush too! The toothbrush also comes with a recharging station so you don&#x27;t have to worry about purchasing that  additionally either. Not a fan of my white? You can pick it up in black! Each toothbrush also comes with a 100% 365 day money back guarantee too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my toothbrush for a couple of weeks now and have absolutely loved it. My teeth feel so nice and clean afterwards, and I&#x27;ve experienced absolutely no teeth sensitivity or bleeding (although a little bleeding at first is normal). I&#x27;ve used some more expensive rechargeable electric toothbrushes too, and the ToiletTree Toothbrush holds its own against the more higher priced brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handy 2 minute timer also has four 30 second intervals to help guide you on the appropriate time to use on the outside upper section, outside lower section, inside upper section, and the inside lower section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ToiletTree Toothbrush oscillates at a quick 8,800 turns per second. You can imagine how much of a better clean that is going to get you compared to your standard toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that my electric toothbrush also came with a handy brushing guide, which I actually learned a few things I didn&#x27;t know about brushing, such as holding the brush in place for a few seconds before moving on to the next tooth, and to brush the gums as well as the teeth!eth!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks now, and I am wonderfully surprised with how clean my teeth feel after use.  For someone who has not used an electric toothbrush for a number of years, there definitely is a learning curve in adjusting to brushing with an electric tootbrush, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Used it for a couple of months and then the top part starting &amp;#34;biting&amp;#34; into my lip when it vibrated.  Also the speed is not nearly as powerful as other brushes I&#x27;ve used.  Wrote to the company 3 times but never received any response.  Finally pitched it and bought an Oral B product.  There&#x27;s $50 out the window.</li>
    <li> Bought it in May but started to use it in July. It did the job but only for a month... I was so happy for the first few weeks with this powerful toothbrush at such a nice price and even bragged about it to my wife. She uses an other brand electronic toothbrush, way expensive one, still working perfectly after one and half years. Then, the tree gained its consciousness and woke us up several times per night tied to make some communications. Since it passed the return deadline, I decided to keep adopting it but moved it to the kitchen during the night and left it alone there. Then... finally... it mentally crushed tonight and stopped to work... even physically it looks still perfect. Not recommended at all.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. This brush is not only aesthetically nice to look at in my bathroom, but it works better than other similar name brand items that are double the price! I highly recommend it. The travel brush is awesome too!</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for over five months - and have even had an opportunity to test the sonic travel toothbrush for an entire week. Never have I wanted a product to perform well as this ToiletTree Electric Toothbrush combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two; one for my wife and one for myself to replace our aged Oral Bs. Disappointing - For my pride in making a &#x27;smart&#x27; purchase got the better of me. As they say, pride precedes the fall - But enough of my &#x27;come to Jesus&#x27; moment and personal growth. Bottom line: This systems fails badly. First the two pros...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small travel-sized battery powered sonic toothbrush is a nice feature. It ran well for one full week, brushing three time a day, on __one__ AAA alkaline battery. That being said, this is a __disposable__ toothbrush - that is. the head cannot be replaced. I&#x27;m not sure, but there&#x27;s a good chance it would outlast the main event. The second pro is the cleaning ease of the rechargeable toothbrush&#x27;s stem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A slick looking product, the rechargeable toothbrush has many foibles. Among these are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge. Disconnect the base&lt;br /&gt;  for a a few hours and you may be using this&lt;br /&gt;  like a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;2. No power. Frequent stalls have become&lt;br /&gt;  progressively worse over the past five months,&lt;br /&gt;  to the point of just making a noise with NO&lt;br /&gt;  rotation. Tapping the unit sometimes reactivates&lt;br /&gt;  the spinning. But this is no 8000+ oscillation&lt;br /&gt;  unit.&lt;br /&gt;3. This is not a robust unit - It easily stalls&lt;br /&gt;  while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my wife&#x27;s unit and mine have the same above problems - Both rechargeable toothbrushes slowly degraded at different rates over the past five months. My wife got so disgusted with the performance of hers, she went back to using a [[ASIN:B008I2ILDK Oral-B Complete Deep Clean Soft Bristles Toothbrush]] - You know, the type your dentist gives away. I suggest the [[ASIN:B003UKM9CO Oral B 1000]] for a cost-competitive, no-frills heavy-duty electric toothbrush that will last several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT RECOMMENDEDCOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I have used many rechargeable tooth brushes and I can honestly say this one is the best ever.  It fits so comfortably in my hand, is light weight, and after I use it my teeth feel like I have just had my teeth cleaned by my dentist.  This toothbrush hits it right out of the ball park.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this toothbrush! It fits perfect in my hand, it&#x27;s light weight and the results I&#x27;m getting are amazing. I feel like I just left the dentist after a cleaning. I&#x27;ve also used their Storm MP3 player and that&#x27;s great for listening to my songs in the bathroom so thought I&#x27;d give this a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. I also just took a trip and used the travel toothbrush and was very pleased. Thanks for having a great product line.</li>
    <li> The travel toothbrush vibrates with a battery.  I especially like the cover on the travel toothbrush, its stubby length, and that can fit in small cosmetic bags, and the option of using it with or without a battery.  A charger is totally the way to go.  No batteries to mess with, and a nice stand to rest on.  We found the base to be a little large–too wide to fit in our mirrored medicine cabinet, so this now resides on top of the toilet, no thanks to our miniature bathroom lacking counter space.  Sitting here, it does get knocked and moved quite a bit, but in a standard bathroom, surely this wouldn’t be a problem.  The slick black probably looks great in any bathroom space, no matter how simple or ritzy.&lt;br /&gt;Many electric toothbrushes have a 2-minute timer, but a cool feature on this toothbrush is the pause every 30 seconds that reminds you to change quadrants.  The number of oscillations (8,800 per minute) feels speedy enough to be thorough while not feeling like a you’re putting a utility drill in your mouth.  The only thing we’re worried about is being able to find replacement heads easily.  Hopefully they’re cheap and easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another cool feature on this toothbrush is that it has two different settings–sensitive and clean, so that if you’re someone who babies their teeth, you’re likely to find a setting you’re comfortable with.</li>
    <li> This product was great, while it worked. I purchased in September and in the beginning of December it started shutting off randomly and now it won&#x27;t even turn on. 3 months of life is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> This rechargeable toothbrush has an ergonomic design and a perfect weight distributed through out the entire brush, which allows you to maneuver the toothbrush comfortably without slipping. The device is waterproof and easy to clean after use. The toothbrush comes with a charging station that is compact in size and is very discreet on the bathroom counter.  More to love about this electric toothbrush is the 2 minute auto-timer!! I love that!! I’m actually brushing for the full 2 minutes that my dentist recommends. Yea ME!! This is the perfect toothbrush.</li>
    <li> excellent product...especially like the smaller head...gets around the back teeth very very well..so far...so very very good</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this purchase overall. It cleans much better than non electric and I like that the head is rounded instead of rectangular like other ones I have tried. My only complaints is that there is kind of a rattling sound that comes from the brush and also it does shut off some during use. Maybe that means I am brushing too hard? Not that big of a deal bc it kicks back on automatically on it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> I got the toothbrush on 6/27/14... I didn&#x27;t want to review the product until I have some time with it. It was a good product and I really like it but today it started failing on me. I left the toothbrush charge overnight so I was expecting to be able to brush my teeth in the morning. The toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t turn on correctly. Every time I press the power button it would spin for a second and shuts off. It keeps on doing it. I ended up using it as a regular toothbrush. I always use the toothbrush when I shower.</li>
    <li> Love the toothbrush. Not to mention the great price.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this item was great. A little strange with the built in timer but a vigorous and comfortable tooth cleaning. That lasted about a month and a half. Then it would stop every time I touched it to my teeth. I have tried everything I know to make this piece of crap function but it&#x27;s useless, and now it is past my window to return it. I bought one at the drugstore for $19.00. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It brushes my teeth and it charges back up when put back on the charger. DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!    UPDATE!!!  After my initial review Steve Parisi from Toilet Tree Products contacted me and offered to send me a replacement. I work in retail and I have for a long time, so I was very impressed with his customer service. I have received my new toothbrush and am using it. So far so good. If it fails again I will update my review, but right now I have to say that Toilet Tree Products has gained a customer simply for their concern for customer satisfaction. That is a wonderful touch in this world. Thank you Steve Parisi and Toilet Tree Products.</li>
    <li> I have never used an rechargeable toothbrush and was really impressed on how clean my teeth felt after each cleaning. I really like how the 2 minute auto time ensures the recommended brushing times.  The high quality DuPont bristle brush heads are gentle on teeth and gums as it also has 2 power setting modes for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Customer support is my number one criteria. If you guys show a genuine interest in the product you are selling me, i&#x27;ll give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;For $40 this thing is a steal. The minimalist design is great, and the brush does what it&#x27;s supposed to. My teeth feel very clean after the 2 minute cycle. There are some areas that are missed, but that&#x27;s user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line--buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. The $40 you spend on this will equal/surpass the $100 you spend on the other toothbrushes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about a week now and so far it is everything that I expected. Love the way my teeth look and feel after brushing. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an above average toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Terrible, quit working after just a few months, don&#x27;t buy not worth the money or frustration,</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush so far.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks, and it works just as well if not better than my old fancy Braun did.  It&#x27;s comfortable, and my teeth feel amazing after brushing.  I would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> ***Update***  After using the brush for about 2 months, that batteries on both my wife&#x27;s and my own have had a difficult time retaining the power they had \\&quot;out of the box.\\&quot; We contacted ToiletTree and they are promptly sending replacements. We are hopeful this is not a recurring problem with the product and that the replacements will operate with some longevity.    ------    Only used for a few weeks, but it truly does work as good, if not better, than the larger brands. It also doesn&#x27;t have many of the unnecessary bells and whistles that I never understood. Like many, I&#x27;d wondered if the price was \\&quot;too good to be true,\\&quot; now I wonder how much I&#x27;ve been overpaying for other electrics. I would recommend the white over the black, as the black will show toothpaste residue more readily. Great product.</li>
    <li> It worked great when I got it, after a little over a month it started leaking when I was brushing. Id end up with stains on my clothes when I&#x27;m trying to leave for work. Then the head of the brush loosened and would get stuck on my side of my mouth. Now I replaced the head, the motor doesn&#x27;t even work. I turn it on and the head doesn&#x27;t even turn just a buzz sound. Hate it, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this in September. By January the toothbrush was no longer charging to full capacity. The brush can barely oscillate now and stops shortly after when it does. I would avoid purchasing this brush; it is poorly engineered for longevity.</li>
    <li> This is great. Holds a charge for a very long time, and has really worked good for getting my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> It worked for about 9 months and broke (would not charge). Not worth for the price</li>
    <li> awesome awesome awesome</li>
    <li> This item worked great for about 3 months, after that time the battery went dead and it stopped recharging. I could get it to work, but not very well and it was completely under-powered. It did work long enough for me to recommend it to a whole bunch of my friends and family. I&#x27;ve now seen many other reviews that had the exact same issue. This company needs to do a serious recall on the batteries in these things.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, and I am very impressed with its operation. Two modes: clean and sensitive. Every 30 seconds it times out so you know to switch mouth &amp;#34;quadrants&amp;#34;. The one I got is black and it has a very stylish charging dock. I would buy another and recommend it to others as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this electric tootbrush and 2 spare brushes in 10/2014. I started having trouble with the brush not charging around the end of 2015. I use it once per day and my cheap electric toothbrush at night before I retire. The toilettree toothbrush does not keep up with the cheaper brand. It is sad to have paid the high cost for the toilettree eledtric toothbrush and it doesn&#x27;t work. The toilettree toothbrush is so slow and just will not brush my teeth. I have tried everything I can think of to fix it. However, it it senseless to keep trying to get it to run faster. It is truly sad because I was very pleased with the toilettree brand at first. It just doesn&#x27;t last long. It&#x27;s just too much money to spend to have something not last long. I believe it is dead and that makes me very disappointed. Would I purchase again or recommend. No, I would not.  Update: I found out the base (the body that you hold in your hand) seems to work okay. Now when I slip on a brush, it dies as soon as I start brushing one tooth, this is when it just completely stops. It&#x27;s been going on for about 8 months, but it got worse every day that passed. Slower, then even slower, and now it stops on me. So, now I am looking into purchasing another electric toothbrush. I am just undecided as to which one I should get. Arghhhh! There is so many. Darn, I really liked this electric toothbrush. Wished it would have lasted longer.</li>
