      <li>but it&#x27;s rare so that leads me to believe it&#x27;s some kind of QC issue rather than</li>
      <li>Easy on the go flossing</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easily to forget to floss when it&#x27;s not been a habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Highly recommend !!!!  </li>
      <li>Plackers are super strong and don&#x27;t shred.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product about 1 year ago and was completely satisfied with the performance and strength of the floss.  </li>
      <li>Pickers to clean teeth.  </li>
      <li>They are very dturdy, no fraying and cheap!</li>
      <li>arrived quick and loves these.</li>
      <li>Also, I can get the job done quickly</li>
      <li>Great little flossers.</li>
      <li>The thread on these is really thin, so it is great for all those tight perfect smiles.</li>
      <li>The Plackers work really well, and I enjoy the mint taste that the floss has.</li>
      <li>also contains a pick that folds out which comes in handy occasionally.</li>
      <li>and they still rarely break.</li>
      <li>Finally, the mint flavor is a nice, added bonus.</li>
      <li>The flossing thread is very strong and the entire package is cost effective.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sure, they taste like mint and that&#x27;s pretty cool, but there&#x27;s something weird about their shape that makes them not feel great in your hand.  </li>
      <li>The fold-out pick is a thoughtful addition and is much better than some others in which the sharp end of the pick is exposed and keeps poking you in the hand as you attempt to floss.</li>
      <li>Great for getting to hard to reach areas.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re extremely durable and make flossing actually enjoyable!</li>
      <li>; - but now I know exactly what they meant.</li>
      <li>These do the job easier, better and faster which encourages regular use.  </li>
      <li>i have tried many different brands and this is the one i now repeatedly buy</li>
      <li>Same quality as from the corner drugstore, but more affordable.</li>
      <li>I guess they are the old design which are better than the new.</li>
      <li>I am completely unsatisfied as I purchased 3 - 90 count packages of these Plackers Micro Mint Flossers and would like a full refund.</li>
      <li>I have a couple spots that shred cheap floss instantly, leaving the remains stuck behind, and these hold up just as perfectly as the old ones.</li>
      <li>It is also strong and stays relatively taut, allowing for easier flossing.</li>
      <li>I love these things, I have been using this brand for a year and have not once had a string break or come loose.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Plackers for years, and have found them to be a convenient, strong, and capable alternative to traditional flossing.</li>
      <li>I have tried other flossers and found that many other brands break very easily between my teeth.  </li>
      <li>These work really well for flossing.</li>
      <li>Much easier to use than floss.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used the &#x27;pick&#x27; part of it yet, but really like the floss part.</li>
      <li>Lastly, one may not think it&#x27;s important but the</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thanks to the manufacturer, not only for a quality floss pick, but for virtue, and commitment to producing a sound product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the pick, but</li>
      <li>but I learned I need to use gently..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real bummer.</li>
      <li>When the Plackers package claims that they&#x27;re &amp;#34;engineered not to stretch, shred, or break,&amp;#34; it really means it.</li>
      <li>Hopefully they will go back to their original style since they were very durable</li>
      <li>On the other hand, the Glide picks appear to be engineered _to_ break, like so many mass-produced goods in our shortsightedly consumptive society, in the fashion of planned obsolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without these things!</li>
      <li>Love how the toothpick is hidden, as it doesn&#x27;t poke you when in your bag.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These things don&#x27;t break. Work great. Mint flavor is lost after about two teeth but who cares. Toothpaste and mouthwash for that.</li>
    <li> I love these things - super convenient and strong.  Other brands I&#x27;ve tried tended to break but Plackers is pretty consistent.  It seems like their quality was slightly lower in my last order but at least none of them taste like BBQ sauce like the one before, and they still rarely break.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a faithful Plackers user, and intend to be for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Plackers for years, and have found them to be a convenient, strong, and capable alternative to traditional flossing. Though never dissatisfied with Plackers, I did recently try Oral-B&#x27;s competing product, the Glide pick, which proved to be comparably terrible. Whereas I can use a Placker for days on end, I was lucky to get through a single floss before the Glide pick broke. When the Plackers package claims that they&#x27;re &amp;#34;engineered not to stretch, shred, or break,&amp;#34; it really means it. On the other hand, the Glide picks appear to be engineered _to_ break, like so many mass-produced goods in our shortsightedly consumptive society, in the fashion of planned obsolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the manufacturer, not only for a quality floss pick, but for virtue, and commitment to producing a sound product.</li>
    <li> Great product! A little tricky to master flossing the back-most teeth but very fast and exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> great product.  floss does not shred.  picks break off so they keep a sharp point and wont poke through your pocket.  i have tried many different brands and this is the one i now repeatedly buy</li>
    <li> I hate flossing so much...until I got these bad boys! They&#x27;re extremely durable and make flossing actually enjoyable! I don&#x27;t really care for the pick, but I like that you have to fold it out to use it, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it poking my hand (usually).</li>
    <li> 1. In Ralphs you can find 150 count packs with $3.5 each pack. The one sold here is way more expensive. 2. The quality is terrible. The string is so loose that you can hardly feel its position between your teeth. I tried the one in safeway, and its much better.  In summary, not worth it.</li>
    <li> After 20+ years of failing to floss regularly despite being scolded annually at my dental appointment, this is the one that finally changed my habits for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three challenges that I&#x27;ve previously faced was 1) my hands were pretty big for my small mouth 2) flossing seemed to take forever, compared to other activities in life 3) it&#x27;s easily to forget to floss when it&#x27;s not been a habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These floss picks worked well to help overcome my challenges.  It&#x27;s sized well for me to reach even my back teeth easily despite my large hands / small mouth.  Also, I can get the job done quickly given the strength of the floss, and its compact size for maneuverability in my small mouth.  Lastly, one may not think it&#x27;s important but the *** packaging is perfectly sized and shaped *** - I simply leave a opened bag on my sink counter as a visual reminder which helps me form a new habit.  I have tried other floss picks before but none of them quite worked out as well as this one did, and neither did individual spools of floss.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Fine and with good price!&lt;br /&gt;Plackers Micro Mint Flossers, 90 count (Pack of 3)&lt;br /&gt;Very good</li>
    <li> Excellent flosser! I buy these for the family. They are perfect for kids and adults. The floss is strong and does not break. Great for getting to hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> I love Plackers. I used to use GUM picks until I got a few bad bags in a row (all the strings broke). Plackers are super strong and don&#x27;t shred.</li>
    <li> Best flossers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Everything that you would expect and arrived on time</li>
    <li> Easily removes any meat from the brontosaurus burger that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Very good but I learned I need to use gently..otherwise Ouchie Owee and blood..Dentist said to go easy..and rinse with good Mouthwash 2 xs a day after flossing.Im 77 still have all my Choppers.Thank You Lord and thank you Dr Ramierez and Staff.</li>
    <li> the item dose not match your picture i wanted the one you advertise you need to change the picture.</li>
    <li> The only flosser I buy! I used to buy lesser quality portable flossers, however, the thread used to break after I finished with the bottom row of my teeth.  With these, I&#x27;ve never experienced this and it leaves your mouth feeling minty.  I also like the &amp;#34;hidden&amp;#34; feature&amp;#34; of the floss pick being concealed until needed.  I&#x27;ve used oral-b ones in the past where it&#x27;s left in the open and I tend to poke myself with it.  Would definitely buy again seeing it&#x27;s at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> arrived quick and loves these. These are sharper than the Glide ones.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I just got a bad batch but these things shred like crazy, a couple even broke before I was done flossing. It&#x27;s a real bummer. The minty taste is great though.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;strong plastic&lt;br /&gt;thin and strong floss&lt;br /&gt;mint flavor is ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;if you dont like mint&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job.. what more do you want.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product about 1 year ago and was completely satisfied with the performance and strength of the floss.  HOWEVER this time it is obvious that the materials used are inferior and have been degraded.  The floss is weaker &amp; often breaks.  I would not buy this product again. This seems to be the product life cycle of so many products.</li>
    <li> These work really well for flossing. I never really liked just using floss string and my use of the wooden toothpicks was very sporadic.&lt;br /&gt;It also contains a pick that folds out which comes in handy occasionally.</li>
    <li> We normally buy these at Walgreens or Target.  Didn&#x27;t realize I could get them through Amazon!  So convenient for us!!  And buying a 3-pack is even better!!  These are the only flossers we like.  The floss doesn&#x27;t tear when I floss between tight teeth, nor does it get loose either.  Even the recognizable popular brands aren&#x27;t as good as these!!</li>
    <li> I am completely displeased with this product.  Upon opening the package, I attempted to use one of the flossers and after sliding it between my teeth, it began to fray and some of the frayed floss got stuck between my teeth.  I thought, maybe it was just one, so I attempted to try another flosser and the same thing happened.  My husband tried them on his teeth and the same thing happened to him.  I am completely unsatisfied as I purchased 3 - 90 count packages of these Plackers Micro Mint Flossers and would like a full refund.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried over 7 types of flossers for my son (kiddie ones, adult ones, name brand ones) and these are the ONLY ones that don&#x27;t break on his teeth! This floss is thin, but this is better than sometimes going through three flossers for a single flossing or the alternative of trying to use string floss on a toddler!!  Not sure what it is about his teeth, none of the other ones break on the other three family members!  We each have a different brand we prefer now, but for my son with the razor sharp teeth, these are his only option.</li>
    <li> Great flossers and very sturdy. They get the job done.</li>
    <li> These flossers work as intended. I&#x27;ve had a few instances of the floss breaking but it&#x27;s rare so that leads me to believe it&#x27;s some kind of QC issue rather than my teeth being sharp or something. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> By far, the BEST flossers. If you are tired of crappy flossers, buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love them</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Read the description for the 75 count package, which stated &amp;#34;MADE IN USA&amp;#34;, and thought I&#x27;d purchase more (90 count, pack of 3).  Just received yesterday and they are actually made in China, which I was specifically trying to avoid for anything that goes in my family&#x27;s mouth!  They are now in the trash.  Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> These are the worst. They fall apart and get stringy and stuck in your teeth. Not good. I&#x27;m so angry that I have 90 of them!</li>
    <li> Easy on the go flossing</li>
    <li> Up until now I was using the classic string wrapped around fingers.  This is great!</li>
    <li> Its good. I like it. Doesnt break between my teeth and that was the problem that I had with some other flossers.</li>
    <li> Great product. Flossing was never easier and with a mint twist. Love this product.</li>
    <li> GREAT flossers, gentle, removes food between teeth w/ ease.  Highly recommend !!!!  My dentist recommended these flossers.for teeth w/ tight spaces.</li>
    <li> These flossers are just... meh.  Sure, they taste like mint and that&#x27;s pretty cool, but there&#x27;s something weird about their shape that makes them not feel great in your hand.  Plus, because the pick part is in the center of the handle (Which I originally thought was quite clever!), it actually makes the handle less stable and somewhat flimsy.  The pick itself is nearly useless because it&#x27;s so thin, and because it&#x27;s super short due to the nature of it being within the handle.  I&#x27;m just gonna go back to the regular Equaline tooth flossers that I got for about a dollar at Target or wherever, because while there are basically a bazillion of these in my house now... I&#x27;m really just not enjoying using them.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite flossers, and I&#x27;ve tried just about all of them. The floss is thin enough to slide easily between your teeth. It is also strong and stays relatively taut, allowing for easier flossing. (I&#x27;ve found the floss in some of the other brands loosens up as you floss, making it more difficult to get the job done.) The portion that goes inside your mouth is smooth and comfortable, unlike some other brands that can have sharp, uncomfortable ridges. The fold-out pick is a thoughtful addition and is much better than some others in which the sharp end of the pick is exposed and keeps poking you in the hand as you attempt to floss. Finally, the mint flavor is a nice, added bonus. These are the ones to &amp;#34;pick!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love these, so easy to use and carry with you. Love how the toothpick is hidden, as it doesn&#x27;t poke you when in your bag.</li>
    <li> Great price. Great quality. Much easier to use than floss. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> The thread on these is really thin, so it is great for all those tight perfect smiles. Then there&#x27;s those of us that never wore our retainer in high school, and some things have shifted over the years. This then becomes a thread that is TOO thin. I use 2-3 at a time because they&#x27;re so thin I have to be more forceful with them to get anything done, therefore shredding the thread after a couple teeth.</li>
    <li> My order came fast and at a great value!</li>
    <li> Plain and basic and three for a good price</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without these things!</li>
    <li> Pickers to clean teeth.  Do the job well.</li>
    <li> Great little flossers. I bought these because you have to bend back the end for the pick, much safer for treaching my toddler how to floss. They are very dturdy, no fraying and cheap! I will continue to buy these.</li>
    <li> Good floss sticks. Hold up well. These are my favorite and buying them in bulk was the way to go. They don&#x27;t fall apart like the &amp;#34;fancier&amp;#34; ones which seem to have a rope instead of a strong plastic floss.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite!!</li>
    <li> The best flosser. Much better than than the ones I bought from CVS.</li>
    <li> Crappy because they break between your teeth. The floss is weak.</li>
    <li> These are the ones to get!  I tried several of the other brands but they were usually too thick and also not durable.  These are absolutely perfect in the size of the floss, they are very tough, and also they have a pleasant hint of a mint taste.  Using regular floss is old school.  These do the job easier, better and faster which encourages regular use.  Look no further!</li>
    <li> As others have reviewed, these are not the pictured old design with the tail pick. I received the new design with the middle folding pick. The problem is that this makes the entire handle feel flimsier since there is a large cut-out in the center of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT find that the floss itself broke or shredded any easier than the old design. I have a couple spots that shred cheap floss instantly, leaving the remains stuck behind, and these hold up just as perfectly as the old ones. I could use them several times if it wasn&#x27;t for fear of bacteria growing in them.</li>
    <li> One of the few flossers I&#x27;ve used that has a thin enough pick end to actually be able to fully use.</li>
    <li> Work great, good price.  Same quality as from the corner drugstore, but more affordable.</li>
    <li> works great for tight teeth and has a pleasant mint flavor.</li>
    <li> Great price and as they claim, I haven&#x27;t broken one yet.</li>
    <li> I love these things, I have been using this brand for a year and have not once had a string break or come loose.  I tried another brand when I couldn&#x27;t find Plackers in the stores and had all kinds of problems with them, which is why I specifically searched online for Plackers.</li>
    <li> We cannot go abck to using the regular floss or even other picks.&lt;br /&gt;These are strong  and do a much better job/ Also like the flavor.</li>
    <li> I have a small mouth and find it difficult to floss back teeth. Plackers work great!</li>
    <li> These are the best flossers I&#x27;ve found and I will continue to purchase them, but not online.  The packaging holding the three packs together was torn and one package of flossers was open with them lying loose in the box.  That doesn&#x27;t happen during shipping and shows carelessness in packaging up my product.  It was a waste of my time to order them online and then have to return them.</li>
    <li> The Plackers work really well, and I enjoy the mint taste that the floss has.</li>
    <li> The flossers arrived on time and has the mint taste. Some of the flossers had a bead on the string which could be deposits from the mint flavor.  The string frays between my tightly packed teeth but overall I like the flossers and the 3-pack means my family has a supply that lasts a while.</li>
    <li> I have tried other flossers and found that many other brands break very easily between my teeth.  These do not break, so I always buy this brand.</li>
    <li> No surprises, good quality, quick shipment.</li>
    <li> Best of the mini-flossers.  Strong thread, grippable handle.</li>
    <li> These are not the tooth picks that were sent. I guess they are the old design which are better than the new. The tooth pick portion on the new ones are flimsy compared to the old style.</li>
    <li> I have never tried Flossers before and really had purchased these for travel or to keep a few in my purse. But now that I&#x27;ve used these, I won&#x27;t go back to regular floss. I think you get a better floss with these, and they are great for back teeth. I had read some reviewers say that if you rinse it after use, you can get several uses out of one and I thought &amp;#34;What ??&amp;#34; - but now I know exactly what they meant. Using it just once seems pretty wasteful, they are definitely durable enough to get at least three uses out of each one and they rinse off very well. Haven&#x27;t used the &#x27;pick&#x27; part of it yet, but really like the floss part.</li>
    <li> Yeah!  I can floss my teeth without the floss breaking!!!!  Since I had braces as a child (and my teeth are REALLY tight), I hated flossing and getting pieces of floss threads stuck between my teeth when the floss broke.  No more!!  YEAH!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife. She loves it !! The flossing thread is very strong and the entire package is cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;Definite recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife and I used to love these and use them all the time, but they recently changed their style (in the last few months) and the string strength is significantly weakened and we have had multiple fray or break when using. Hopefully they will go back to their original style since they were very durable and we never had issues with them.</li>
    <li> flossie flossie. great refills.</li>
    <li> Strong and effective! Haven&#x27;t had one break yet.</li>
