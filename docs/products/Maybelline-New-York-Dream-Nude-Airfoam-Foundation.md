<li> Additionally, it&#x27;s a bit difficult to control the amount of foundation that comes out of the bottle.</li>
<li> so I brought 2 sad to say I must now find another foundation!</li>
<li> like I&#x27;m so disappointed.  </li>

    <li> Love this foundation and happy I found it online because many stores don&#x27;t carry this anymore. I thought Maybelline stopped making it until I checked their site. This is my summer foundation for when I have a tan. Perfect match</li>
    <li> coverage was ok, spreading everywhere, and got on everything, so if you touch your face please don&#x27;t touch anything else...</li>
    <li> Great product can not figure why it has been no longer available in stores</li>

    <li> I just love this product so much it makes u have that celebrity airbrushed  look very great on your face protection from the sun with SPF18 I been using for years you have to find the right color that matches your skin delivered within 3 weeks</li>
    <li> Makeup was  brand new and fresh</li>
    <li> Coverage matches my skin tone and is as light as a feather.  I did not have any trouble with the amount that comes out as others have complained about.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t press the nozzle to hard or heavy.  What I did not like about it was the color came out at times uneven (light and dark).  I personally found a way to fix that problem: hold the container upside down and shake it up &amp; down for about a minute.  Turn it upright and dispense the foundation into your hand or make up sponge.  By doing that, I found the color comes out more even.  Yes, I know it&#x27;s a lot of shaking but it works or at least it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as I said before it&#x27;s so light, I can&#x27;t feel it on my face.

    <li> First time trying this and I must say I like it</li>
    <li> Worst stuff ever no coverage, too messy and too light.</li>
    <li> Ive used this prior to ordering from amazon. The shade is so popular, the store is always out. Its a medium coverage light weight foundation</li>
