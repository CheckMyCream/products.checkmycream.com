<li> As for the product itself, I do not know how they can call it invisible, as it definetly shows on black clothing and you can even see white on your skin after applying.</li>
<li> After one use of this product i noticed that my underarms were starting to get red, WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>
<li> I tried many other brands before Secret with no luck and from the beginning, Secret worked for me.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m tired of searching in the store and then coming home with something new that I don&#x27;t want.</li>
<li> Be careful with dark shirts though as it does leave marks!</li>
<li> the only scent from secret that did not give me a reaction is the vanilla.</li>
<li> but unfortunately does not work well with my natural scent</li>
<li> A hard thing to do when you have found the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; and</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t compare to Secret Expressions in scent.  </li>
<li> Thank you Secret!</li>
<li> and I always wake up smelly and my armpits are sore :(</li>
<li> there is from dove to degree and even suave and they&#x27;re all terrible</li>

    <li> Great smell, I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I love secret and the smell is subtle, but nice&lt;br /&gt; However, i am noticing it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as it used to. I don&#x27;t sweat, but I am noticing that it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold off odor like I prefer. Will try a different brand to compare...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to lots of things but this is great n scent is pretty n clean.</li>
    <li> After Arrid stopped making their powder scent, I was left scrabbling to find a replacement.  A hard thing to do when you have found the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; and it all of a sudden it is not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through suave and Degree.  They don&#x27;t compare to Secret Expressions in scent.  It makes my morning to put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t stop me from sweating completely....though its great smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully they keep make making it better by increasing the gly just a tad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product on the whole.  Packaging is great.</li>
    <li> Item is as described and arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Thank you! Everything is super!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t smell.  Thank you Secret!</li>
    <li> Keeps odors away and smells fabulous!</li>
    <li> Does what you expect it to do.</li>
    <li> I have used Secret brand for years and have always been pleased with it&#x27;s effectiveness. I tried many other brands before Secret with no luck and from the beginning, Secret worked for me. Also, it is a great value (cheaper than you can buy at the leading big chain stores) when I use Subscribe and Save and get 20% off with five S&amp;S items for the month.</li>
    <li> This deodorant package broke after trying to &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; the bottom to push the product up.  The twist bottom separated from the part that holds the product and now you cannot twist the product up.  Had to throw away a brand new deodorant because there was no way to get the product out.  As for the product itself, I do not know how they can call it invisible, as it definetly shows on black clothing and you can even see white on your skin after applying. Would never buy this again. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great product, great scent.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Be careful with dark shirts though as it does leave marks!</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells amazing but unfortunately does not work well with my natural scent AT ALL. I sweat &amp; stress A LOT at work (I&#x27;m a vet tech in an emergency &amp; specialty veterinary hospital) &amp; this works fairly well as an antiperspirant but does NOTHING to control the smell. I normally avoid wearing perfume to work because animals are pretty sensitive to heavy scents but I also don&#x27;t want my coworkers or clients smelling stinky pits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, these tubes are made really crappy. The bottom broke the very first time I tried to crank it to apply. I&#x27;ve tried multiple times to push it back up, hoping it click into place but it doesn&#x27;t. &amp; every time I apply, it pushes back down. I&#x27;m throwing this away &amp; looking for something else.</li>
    <li> No complaints here!  I have used this deodorant for years now and know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant smells great and works wonderful for even highly active people.  I have tried all the scents and definitely like this one the best.  The others still smell great though and I am guessing its more of a preference thing more than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue buying from here as its higher priced at our local store.</li>
    <li> Best scent And it lasts for so long. I will never use another deodorant again</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this deodorant and the scent.  Also, she smells pretty darn good, the price is good; so, overall, I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be Clear I&#x27;ve tried  every deodorant there is from dove to degree and even suave and they&#x27;re all terrible I sweat when I sleep and I always wake up smelly and my armpits are sore :( secret is the only thing that&#x27;s worked for me it costs more but I only need a tiny bit once a day so I break even compared to cheap brands. Best you can buy.</li>
    <li> After one use of this product i noticed that my underarms were starting to get red, WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! the only scent from secret that did not give me a reaction is the vanilla. time to back to that one.</li>
    <li> I bought this online because I know what type and scent I like and I&#x27;m tired of searching in the store and then coming home with something new that I don&#x27;t want.</li>
