      <li>perfect feel.</li>
      <li>Perfect shade, perfect wear,</li>
      <li>It is perfect for all woman.</li>
      <li>I ordered this lipstick based on the great five star reviews..  </li>
      <li>Feels great not drying, creamy consistency</li>
      <li>happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I love the color!!</li>
      <li>and it looks good with everything.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for all skin tones.  </li>
      <li>I like the color (I got the #14) and it looks good, glides on well.</li>
      <li>It is a good choice if you like something that is kind of nude</li>
      <li>still a good neutral when I&#x27;m wearing grayer tones, not gold or warm.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this nudish lip color!</li>
      <li>The texture is amazing.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice color.</li>
      <li>and this nude really feels creamy and looks great!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it</li>
      <li>this lipstick is more of a nude color as described.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again for sure.</li>
      <li>and I usually love nudes.</li>
      <li>Love them smell/taste of it, almost a raspberry fragrance.</li>
      <li>The lipstick is the perfect color and it stays on longer than  all my other brands.</li>
      <li>but it works fine.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s actually more soft and blends well natural looking than the orangey appearnce it gives off here, very smooth very nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Number 14 went on as a light pinkish cocoa...</li>
      <li>I have light skin and brown eyes</li>
      <li>so it is a good product for a natural look</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s not moisturizing and it doesn&#x27;t stay on for 8 hours, but overall, it&#x27;s a good lipstick.</li>
      <li>That will be a first!</li>
      <li>It is not too light, not too dark, not too pink, not too brown, not sparkly - it is perfect!</li>
      <li>I feel like it&#x27;s a tiny bit more pinkish</li>
      <li>Really want exciting to get this after reading some of the reviews.</li>
      <li>It is a very pretty nudish brown, but just a couple shades darker than my natural lip color.</li>
      <li>I really like the product.</li>
      <li>It has a lot of gray brown or taupe in the undertone, but I really like the shade.  </li>
      <li>the thing i really like is its staying power.</li>
      <li>you never really can be sure of the color.</li>
      <li>It is very smoothe to apply.</li>
      <li>I love it with my dark makeup and it goes well with anything for an over 3 dollar lippy</li>
      <li>This particular color, 014, is an OK neutral, but a bit too orangey for my very pale skin (I have dark hair and blue eyes, and I tend to wear more pink-based lip colors, such as MR Rose Blush).</li>
      <li>I really love this lipstick, it is my everyday shade.  </li>
      <li>and I love this lipstick for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>The color is less red than expected on this 014 shade, it&#x27;s more of a dark pink with a tinge of light brown but the color looks still really good, kinda natural lip color but darker</li>
      <li>but with a little gloss it looks just fine and very natural.</li>
      <li>A little to light for me</li>
      <li>It has a natural look to it</li>
      <li>I thought it would be slightly pinker or coral, but it is almost on the cool side.  </li>
      <li>Neutral color and does not dry out lips.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing, but does need to be applied frequently throughout the day, but that is usual for me.  </li>

<li> it is very similiar to the color of your natural lips, but a little darker (for me at least)</li>

<li> ya, if i throw back a few beers or down a pot of coffee it comes off eventually, but what lipstick lasts through that?</li>
<li> don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re dark.</li>

<li> its always tough to get something like lipstick online because of differences in monitor settings on your computer.</li>
<li> very subtle color.</li>
<li> I was disappointed when the lipstick arrived because it was not the coral shade pictured.  </li>
<li> I feel like I hated lipstick before because of that.</li>
<li> IT ALSO DOES NOT SMELL BAD!!</li>

    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;Smooth finish&lt;br /&gt;Glides on effortlessly&lt;br /&gt;Subtle glow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;You can &#x27;taste it&#x27;...loss of a star on this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number 14 went on as a light pinkish cocoa...very subtle color.</li>
    <li> Neutral color and does not dry out lips.</li>
    <li> I really love this lipstick, it is my everyday shade.  It has a natural look to it, it goes on well and stays on too.  The shade 14 is a nude shade and it it is very similiar to the color of your natural lips, but a little darker (for me at least) and I love this lipstick for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> its always tough to get something like lipstick online because of differences in monitor settings on your computer. you never really can be sure of the color. this lipstick is more of a nude color as described. the thing i really like is its staying power. ya, if i throw back a few beers or down a pot of coffee it comes off eventually, but what lipstick lasts through that? happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect shade, perfect wear, perfect feel. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again for sure. That will be a first!</li>
    <li> I go blonde and tan during the summer.  I have light skin and brown eyes and this nude really feels creamy and looks great!  It is not too light, not too dark, not too pink, not too brown, not sparkly - it is perfect!</li>
    <li> The lipstick is the perfect color and it stays on longer than  all my other brands. I had bought one at a local retail store,but when I went back they didn&#x27;t have that shade so I tried a few other stores and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. As a last resort, I looked online and  found it without any problem.  Thank you Rimmel, I hope you contine to make that shade #14.</li>
    <li> This color accentuates your lip ridges. Like putting foundation on your lips.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is drier than I expected. Having been a devoted wearer of Rimmel lipstick for years, I thought I&#x27;d switch it up a bit and try the Lasting Finish, but I think I&#x27;ll be sticking with my Moisture Renew line after all.  I found that I had to reapply the Lasting Finish lipstick every other hour, so not much difference there.  This particular color, 014, is an OK neutral, but a bit too orangey for my very pale skin (I have dark hair and blue eyes, and I tend to wear more pink-based lip colors, such as MR Rose Blush).</li>
    <li> Love them smell/taste of it, almost a raspberry fragrance. I can&#x27;t stand lipstick that smells/tastes like crayons, I end up not wearing it.</li>
    <li> Really want exciting to get this after reading some of the reviews. The color made my skin tone look pale and I usually love nudes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lipstick based on the great five star reviews..  I was disappointed when the lipstick arrived because it was not the coral shade pictured.  It is more of a thick beigy nude that adds no color whatsoever, and not the least bit flattering.to my complexion.  Since everyone else loves it, it&#x27;s probably just me but I want to clarify the actual color to those who think the lipstick looks like the photo.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re dark. It will make you look like you were eating powder doughnuts. It is very smoothe to apply.</li>
    <li> This is a nice color. It is perfect for all woman. It is a good choice if you like something that is kind of nude and it looks good with everything. You will like this lipstick, I promise.</li>
    <li> Love this nudish lip color!</li>
    <li> Not as pink as i thought it would be</li>
    <li> A little to light for me but it works fine. It is too nude almost like a foundation but with a little gloss it looks just fine and very natural.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s actually more soft and blends well natural looking than the orangey appearnce it gives off here, very smooth very nice. I love it with my dark makeup and it goes well with anything for an over 3 dollar lippy I would buy this one again I just hope that  if I can&#x27;t find it again with Target I can get it here. , while it does come off when drinking and eating I don&#x27;t mind re applying and it makes my lips feel moisturized, another excellent Rimmel product!</li>
    <li> The color is less red than expected on this 014 shade, it&#x27;s more of a dark pink with a tinge of light brown but the color looks still really good, kinda natural lip color but darker so it is a good product for a natural look</li>
    <li> Awesome! Feels great not drying, creamy consistency</li>
    <li> It has a lot of gray brown or taupe in the undertone, but I really like the shade.  I thought it would be slightly pinker or coral, but it is almost on the cool side.  still a good neutral when I&#x27;m wearing grayer tones, not gold or warm.</li>
    <li> It came totally broke and damage i cant use it</li>
    <li> Saw this lipstick on Marlena off of Makeup Geek and had to have it.  It is very moisturizing, but does need to be applied frequently throughout the day, but that is usual for me.  It is a very pretty nudish brown, but just a couple shades darker than my natural lip color.</li>
    <li> I make the color last longer by putting chap stick over it. I guess it&#x27;s hard to know what to expect from the picture to how it&#x27;s applied. I feel like it&#x27;s a tiny bit more pinkish then implied with the picture but none the less I really like the product. IT ALSO DOES NOT SMELL BAD!! I feel like I hated lipstick before because of that. You can literally &#x27;smell&#x27; when someone is wearing makeup sometimes and this product doesn&#x27;t have that problem. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that perk. Maybe it shouldn&#x27;t be a perk. Idk. I like what I got and will probably just use this bran from now on.</li>
    <li> I love the color!! It&#x27;s good for all skin tones.  I was not sure at first but once I put it one ... The texture is amazing.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it</li>
