      <li>Just rubbed on my face and dead skin came right off.</li>
      <li>These three jars were either half full or one side of the jar was about three quarters of the way down.</li>

My skin feels so smooth and clean after using, and looks natural and flawless after I apply some moisturizer and Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation (which is a very light foundation).  Warning...you will be tempted but do not use it too often, or you will see flakes on your skin, and your skin may get more sensitive.  It is meant for maintainence only by getting rid of the top layer of dead skin.  Buy on Amazon and don&#x27;t buy at the mall booths....way overpriced there.</li>
    <li> Loved this product.  Will order again.  It truly peels the skin and leaves your facial soft and radiant. I highly recommended it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. I use often and boy does it remove the dead skin. Leaves skin refreshed and soft. A winner!</li>

    <li> Help get rid of dead skin</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It works! Fast shipping, and I plan to do business here again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I discovered this sort of on accident.  I purchased a jar of this from a discount store not realizing that I was buying a miracle in a jar!  I was shocked at how well it worked.  Results are immediate.  No scratchy feeling on your skin like with scrubs.  No burning like with products that have acids.  No redness.  Not drying.  Just really beautiful, soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not necessary for daily use.  I use it twice weekly and could not be happier with the results!</li>
    <li> It has taken the dark spots off my face.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This is not a scrub and it is not a peel.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got 3 for less than $25. I paid about $40 for one at the mall. I really love this product,works great and leaves my face feeling like a baby butt.....super soft!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap on here. It&#x27;s so incredibly expensive at the mall.</li>
    <li> You will never realize how much dead skin you have on your face until you try this product.  Use once per week and you will notice wonderful and impressive results.  Purchase from Amazon as well, the savings are outstanding.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it once a week and it leaves my skin feeling very smooth. The packaging was good but all three jars were half filled.

These three jars were either half full or one side of the jar was about three quarters of the way down. Seems to have been used and not new as advertised.</li>
    <li> I like the product but not sure if the dirt that comes off if actually dead skin. I think it&#x27;s the crystals in the face peel!</li>
    <li> Delivered as ordered.  Product works well and price was reasonable</li>
    <li> Great exfoliating product.</li>
    <li> Great price, speedy delivery. A+.</li>
