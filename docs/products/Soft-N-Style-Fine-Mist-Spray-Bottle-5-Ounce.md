      <li>These work perfectly.</li>
      <li>Excellent service!</li>
      <li>and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These work well and are a good value for the money.</li>
      <li>They are good bottle sparys.&lt;br /&gt;Transparent</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s see if they are any good.  </li>
      <li>I make my own glass cleaner and keep some bottles in the car for navigation touch screen cleaning.</li>
      <li>Nice size.</li>
      <li>I mix my own hand sanitizer spray and take it with me to the gym, etc.  </li>
      <li>If you need a good fine mist sprayer</li>
      <li>The pump requires more pressure than I would prefer.</li>
      <li>After a couple use, the liquid kept leaking from around the top.</li>
      <li>nice light, misty spray....</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>I love these bottles.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
      <li>The pump action is very strong and the lid seals up good.</li>
      <li>You can travel with it easily.</li>
      <li>i would shop here again for my fine mist spray bottle needs.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>It sprays a fine mist, as described and they do come with covers.</li>
      <li>The nozzle works, and it is a fine mist.</li>
      <li>Cheap, and they work.</li>
      <li>Got these and filled them with PIPS.</li>
      <li>I find they are very useful</li>
      <li>Work good but could buy cheaper individually at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
      <li>The bottles stay secure and hold just the right amount of liquid.</li>

      <li>The spray bottles of brand name toners definitely work better if you want really fine mist.</li>

      <li>Might because of hot weather.</li>

      <li>USP solution for my IFAK and first aid kits.  </li>
      <li>I needed something for the bathroom to hold vinegar spray that would more toddler-proof than a regular spray bottle and with a small footprint to fit on a crowded shelf, and this fit the bill.</li>
      <li>only downside with it is that the mist from the sprayer is not as fine as I was expecting.</li>
      <li>and this is a reasonable price for three of them.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t leak out and they&#x27;re very functional.</li>
      <li>You can get little spray bottles from Target that are cheaper, don&#x27;t take weeks to get delivered, and are better quality.</li>
      <li>Well, the first one stopped working the second time I used it.  </li>
      <li>No trouble putting liquid in or using the sprayer.</li>
      <li>Fine mist spray in small bottle.</li>
      <li>I ordered a 3-pack of these 5-oz bottles and got exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>The bottle feels like hard plastic instead of the cheap soft ones.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with the spray from some other bottles producing too large of droplets in the spray, but these are truly a &amp;#34;fine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s obviously all plastic, so we&#x27;ll see how long they last, but I&#x27;ve had no problems so far</li>
      <li>then you can&#x27;t go wrong with these Soft N Style Fine Sprayer bottles.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would give it 5 stars if it doesn&#x27;t keep leaking.  I mix my own hand sanitizer spray and take it with me to the gym, etc.  After a couple use, the liquid kept leaking from around the top.</li>
    <li> Fine mist spray in small bottle. I make my own glass cleaner and keep some bottles in the car for navigation touch screen cleaning. These work perfectly.</li>
    <li> These were just what i was looking for. i would shop here again for my fine mist spray bottle needs.</li>
    <li> I love these bottles. They arrived faster than I expected. It sprays a fine mist, as described and they do come with covers. I use them to store my oils.</li>
    <li> nice light, misty spray....love it</li>
    <li> I needed something for the bathroom to hold vinegar spray that would more toddler-proof than a regular spray bottle and with a small footprint to fit on a crowded shelf, and this fit the bill. It makes a fine mist but not super super fine, so its good for cleaning purposes, and it&#x27;s clear plastic so its not too bad to look at either.</li>
    <li> these work exactly as i need them to. If you need a good fine mist sprayer then you can&#x27;t go wrong with these Soft N Style Fine Sprayer bottles.</li>
    <li> 3/6/15: I had bought a pack of 3 bottles, but I only got one. If the others arrive later than this one, I&#x27;ll edit the review - but for now, only one star.</li>
    <li> These work well and are a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> The product arrived missing a sprayer lid, but the sellers has been helpful in terms of the refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a descent one. The bottle feels like hard plastic instead of the cheap soft ones. You can travel with it easily. I plan to use it for toner when I travel because my toners are in 300ML to 500ML bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside with it is that the mist from the sprayer is not as fine as I was expecting. The spray bottles of brand name toners definitely work better if you want really fine mist.</li>
    <li> One out of the three bottles ordered was actually deformed.  It literally could not stand upright as the bottom of it was warped/shriveled up.  Have not yet used the bottles without visual defects.  Will update if any further negative issues are found.</li>
    <li> These are good for the purpose I need (making a diluted cleaning solution and making natural insect repellant with distilled water, essential oils, and vinegar). The nozzle works, and it is a fine mist. However, don&#x27;t shake them too vigorously. Otherwise, the liquid comes out of the sprayer nozzle.</li>
    <li> I ordered a 3-pack of these 5-oz bottles and got exactly what I expected. I&#x27;ve had problems with the spray from some other bottles producing too large of droplets in the spray, but these are truly a &amp;#34;fine mist&amp;#34; like the description says. It&#x27;s obviously all plastic, so we&#x27;ll see how long they last, but I&#x27;ve had no problems so far and this is a reasonable price for three of them.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken, not in the original shape.  Might because of hot weather.</li>
    <li> Excellent service! Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> These bottles are sturdy, spray well, and are a heck of a lot cheaper than any you can find (if you can find them at all) locally.  Perhaps a certain batch had a problem which some people had to deal with, but this group has been fine.</li>
    <li> They spray a mist burst which is what I need.  Cheap, and they work.</li>
    <li> Works well. Nice size. No trouble putting liquid in or using the sprayer.</li>
    <li> These were exactly as I expected. I bought them for hair detangler I formulated at home and didn&#x27;t want residues from other products contaminating it. They produce a fine mist, the pump isn&#x27;t difficult to depress, and include caps. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Got these and filled them with PIPS. USP solution for my IFAK and first aid kits.  The pump action is very strong and the lid seals up good.</li>
    <li> Works great as a spray bottle with water for diaper changes!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t really work and jammed after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> They are good bottle sparys.&lt;br /&gt;Transparent and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I use it keep liquid that i want to spary on hairs or face.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t leak out and they&#x27;re very functional. They work just as I expect and I&#x27;m pleased. Sometimes, it&#x27;ll want to shoot a stream out instead of a mist, but it&#x27;s not the end of the world and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Well, the first one stopped working the second time I used it.  I would give them one star but I want to give the other two bottles the benefit of the doubt.  Let&#x27;s see if they are any good.  You can get little spray bottles from Target that are cheaper, don&#x27;t take weeks to get delivered, and are better quality.</li>
    <li> Work good but could buy cheaper individually at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
    <li> The pump requires more pressure than I would prefer.</li>
    <li> I use this for a lot of things! I find they are very useful</li>
    <li> The bottles stay secure and hold just the right amount of liquid.</li>
