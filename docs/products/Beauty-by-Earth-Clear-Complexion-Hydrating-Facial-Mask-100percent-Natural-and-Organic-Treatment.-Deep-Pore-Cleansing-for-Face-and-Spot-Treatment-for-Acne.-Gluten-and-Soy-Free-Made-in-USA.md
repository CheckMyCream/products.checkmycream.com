<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> haven&#x27;t tried this yet, but my wife said she&#x27;s very excited about it. we haven&#x27;t gotten anything bad from this company yet, so i don&#x27;t figure this will let us down :)</li>
    <li> This was packaged well and arrived promptly.  Great clay mask that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling dry!  It tightens on your face as it dry, but after washing it off, my skin felt cleansed and soft.  What a great product!</li>
    <li> I like it and it will give your skin a good moisture.  It is like just a cream and put on your skin so it covers pretty good and then it will gradually dry and keep moisture on your skin.  After that you just rinse off with warm water.  You can tell the difference before and after.  It works great!</li>
    <li> Tried it for the first time the other week. Wasnt as messy as I thought It would be, and it felt kinda cool on my face. It was soothing, not like other masks I have tried that felt drying and tough. It came off easily, and my skin felt great afterwards. Definitely enjoyed using this product.  :)</li>
    <li> I really like this mask. It has a nice minty smell and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product and brand. This is the 5th product I have bought from Beauty by Earth. I am impressed with the products and quality of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does exactly what I need; nourishes my dry skin from being out in the sun constantly. Thank you so much. Look forward to more of your products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing! I&#x27;ve used MANY different masks before, but this one has far surpassed my expectations. If you like to pamper yourself, you&#x27;ve gotta buy this! The texture is perfect, it&#x27;s light, washes off easily, and smells INCREDIBLE!!!!! This has become my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; facial mask. Try it out...you won&#x27;t be disappointed! :)</li>
    <li> This face mask is amazing! It&#x27;s very thick and exfoliating which is great for your skin! It also has a light minty smell to it which is very appealing, I love the way it smells! I love how it comes in a tube, it&#x27;s very convenient. You leave the mask on for 10-15 minutes and after about 5 minutes, your face starts to feel tighter and more firm. This mask really does a tremendous job, my skin hasn&#x27;t felt or looked better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received free for the purpose of my review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This product came in just in time, my face felt really dry today so Ithought I&#x27;d try the facial mask. It&#x27;s a great product you can use it twice a week, it clears off all dull skin &amp; leaves it soft to the touch . I will keep this product in my cabinet...I&#x27;m pleased to share my opinion after testing this product.</li>
    <li> This really made my skin feel good.I thought it was gonnna be really strong, but it wasnt.It  was actually very mild on my skin.</li>
    <li> This has made a huge difference to my face. I will definitely recommend this product. My face is elected feeling clean and silky.</li>
    <li> Beauty by Earth Facial Mask is wonderful!  I have relatively good skin that needed a little &#x27;tweeking&#x27;.  The scent was very refreshing, and the tingling of the mask was very invigorating!  When I removed the mask, my skin was hydrated and smooth.  My nose, the real test, was clean looking and the pores were clearly diminished.  My face was hydrated with an all over clean looking shine.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, after using it your skin feels so clean, refreshed and hydrating . I love the way my skin felt after using it, so fresh and smooth. The scent is so invigorating, that alone is enough to make you want to use it. It lathers great and opens your pores and removes dirt and grime that you don&#x27;t even realize that is on your skin. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting clean, hydrated skin or just for a deep cleanse.</li>
    <li> leaves my skin so soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> I Love My Facial Mask. My Face Now Looks Fresh Not More Shinny And Very Fresh.</li>
    <li> Face feels soft and hydrated. I did help my acne and other skin problems abit. Good mask for wintertime. I used it when i feel that my skin needs more of hydration boost. :D</li>
    <li> This felt so nice in my face! It smells great too. I get acne but have pretty delicate skin so can&#x27;t use many ache products. This product was gentle enough to not dry out my face but effective enough to help the pimples. So far I am super happy about it!</li>
    <li> I have never felt my skin so soft and clean at the same time.  I am a huge fan of BBE and have loved all of their products that I tried.  I use their lip balms, sunscreen, Argan oil and now this wonderful item!  It is easy to use.  I suggest you put it on and lie back and watch a video or two while it dries.  It comes off easily and cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please give this a try!  You will love it!</li>
    <li> I have purchased a few masks on Amazon and this product is my favorite by far. It is very smooth to put on and easy to wash off. My skin looks tight and refreshed, plus feels soft. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Worked like magic!!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I used it today and was definitely impressed with this company. First thing I noticed was their packaging. They did a really good job and it was beautiful! It also comes with very clear instructions on the box and on the tube as well. As far as the facial mask working- it did a wonderful job and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin like most others do. It has a good smell but not overwhelming and once rinsed, made my skin feel amazing! I&#x27;m really happy I got this and will definitely order again! :)</li>
    <li> I loved this on my face and the smell awesome. Only used once .  Will update after several uses.  Skin feels so smooth</li>
    <li> Spa Day!  It only took one application for me to love this love this.  Smells like a spa treatment, feels like a spa treatment, and gives results like a spa treatment.</li>
    <li> Been using for the past two weeks and I already see such an improvement in my skin.  I feel like I&#x27;m giving myself an at the spa facial. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry like other products have in the past.  This has been a great addition to my facial regimen.</li>
    <li> Nice fresh smell, kind of minty. Felt great on my face and after I took it off my face felt wonderful! Not drying but very refreshing. I will be using twice a week from now on. Great product for the price. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of this until recently but I&#x27;m glad I found out about it. It really helped clear my pores. I have dry skin and it hydrates it amazingly too. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful and light! I love the slight tingle it gives your skin when you first apply it and it&#x27;s a great texture and consistency. My skin had a glow when I removed it and was so smooth and hydrated! I love that it&#x27;s all organic products and while I have sensitive skin that irritates easily and turns red this was great on my face and I had no reaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product one time and can tell a difference in my skin.  My skin is much softer, brighter and my makeup goes on easier.  No redness or irritatation and it wasn&#x27;t drying.  So many times I have used a mask that has dried my skin out and made matters worse.  It didn&#x27;t have an awful smell like a lot of facial masks do. I look forward to using it again.</li>
    <li> This mask left my oily skin feeling very moisturized.  It&#x27;s a great way to help add moisture without feeling weighed down by creams.  Face has been less oily and clearer since using.</li>
    <li> Love this facial! Made my skin so soft! It was easy to apply and has a nice aroma. I loved that it is organic too. I also noticed it made my skin look hydrated and alive, unlike some facials this one doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling oily either. Only thing to remember to do is wet your face throughly that way it is easier to apply the cream. Enjoyed this facial three times now and will continue to enjoy.</li>
    <li> I have used my fair share of facial masks over the past year alone and this one stands out to me. There is no dead fish smell like many other masks out there thank goodness, and after using it, my skin feels so nice and clean and the best part... Hydrated! Usually after a mask my skin feels so dry and red but this mask does the job without wreaking havoc on my skin. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I just love it. Definantly worth a try. I received a discount for this product for the exchange of my honest unbias review.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I had to quickly put this mask on my face because it started to dry really quick! Like many others I noticed that I got that &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; feeling instead of my face feeling hydrated. Also even though the mask said its unscented it has a &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; smell to it. Like you can smell the ingredients used to make it. So far it hasn&#x27;t  broken my skin out. I took off one star because of how quickly it started to dry and I didn&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; effects. Also that &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; smell still lingers on the face. My skin did look brighter though so I&#x27;ll give you that! : )</li>
    <li> It smells like essential oils which I really like. I&#x27;ve only tried once so far and I think it&#x27;s working really really good. It gets dry pretty fast though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice mask. I like the way it dry out on my skin . It&#x27;s Leave your skin smooth . The only thing I did not feel it&#x27;s clean the skin well . But I really like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, cruelty free which is SO IMPORTANT TO ME!! I only use it a few times . So I will keep give it a try .</li>
    <li> This mask leaves my face feeling more toned somehow.  I am a big fan of products with no added junk and this is one of those.  I am a big fan of this company in general.  I think I&#x27;ve purchased pretty much all their products at this point!</li>
    <li> Great mask!  Smells fantastic and my skin felt clean and smooth after using!</li>
    <li> amazing face mask ! I love it ,, My face felt smooth  after I removed the mask, my pores were cleaned, and I felt my skin rejuvenated,,…It is so hydrating , its smell is very acceptable .. very recommended ..</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS... First of all, the scent is divine... also, after using it only one time, I can see &amp; feel  results ALREADY. Skin so much smoother. CLEANS DIRT &amp; GUNK OUT OF PORES, MOISTURIZES @ THE SAME TIME. TONES DIWN ANY REDNESS YOUIGHT HAVE Can&#x27;t wait  to use it again (but I&#x27;ll wait a couple of days)  Applied a bit of &amp;#34;Beauty By Earth&amp;#34; toner, afterwards. THEIR PRODUCTS ARE AMAZING. THEY GIVE VERY HELPFUL ADVISE/INSTRUCTION IF YOU NEED IT!  A small amount is all it takes...but don&#x27;t be stingy...should last quite a while.</li>
    <li> This mask is wonderful. It has a very light pleasant scent, no harsh fragrance odors. My skin feels wonderful after using it.</li>
    <li> Good, but burns your face if you leave it on for too long.</li>
    <li> I must admit,I was a little bit skeptical about this product,because usually they promise more than they tend to deliver.But not this one! My skin was extremely moisturized and smooth after this particular mask.But the biggest benefit was the next day-the face had dewy glow and I didn&#x27;t need to put so much of the makeup to cover up all the imperfections.I would definitely recommend it to anyone,who wants to improve their skins condition and look at least 10 years younger.</li>
    <li> Recently being a new customer for amazon, I thought this product would be worth it as one of my first purchases. It is worth it, I love the mask. The directions are simple and easy. After I rinsed the mask off and pat dry with a towel, my face felt so clean. My skin looks hydrated and radiant.I feel rejuvenated. My face has a lot of tiny pimples, especially on my cheeks. Looking at the results from just one use, I have high hopes that this mask will help with my acne. I am planning to make a second purchase after I run out.</li>
    <li> I love that this mask is pure and gentle.  It&#x27;s also unscented.  Left my face feeling so soft, unlike the chemical masks that leave you skin so dry!</li>
    <li> I have used many face masks over the years. This is the first one that I rinsed off any my skin felt amazing! It was so soft &amp; smooth! The morning after it still felt great! I will defiantly tell all my friends about this product!! Keep up the good work BBE! I&#x27;m lookin forward to trying more of your organic beauty products! 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!</li>
    <li> I am not real big on face care in general, I&#x27;ve always had pretty normal skin and a consistent complexion, but I bought this for a friend because I really like the BBE product line, the products are always really good. She says she likes it and is now looking at the other stuff they offer. Good, quality products for a good price are hard to find these days, keep up the good work you guys! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and feel of this face mask!  Very refreshing and fun to use.  Spreads very easily, too.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it was great for it! Left my face feeling clean! I used a wipe afterwards to see if it deep cleaned and it did! Will buy again</li>
    <li> Smelled amazing, felt amazing, crazy healthy. Made me brake out a little in my t zone, probably because it was pulling out of my pores though.</li>
    <li> The Beauty by Earth Clear Complexion Hydrating mask is awesome.  My chin breaks out really bad and often.  I have used the mask just one time since receiving it a couple days ago and my skin felt so good and my acne on my chin has dried out and is clearing up! My skin felt so clean like the mask reached deep into my pores to clean them out. This is one of the best face masks I have used!</li>
    <li> Love this mask my face feels like a baby&#x27;s skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week and I must admit i am a believer in this product. I have seen a difference in my skin. My skin use to peel due to the weather but I have seen less peeling when using twice a week. My skin is showing clearer and softer.</li>
    <li> Easy to use! The cream is easy to apply, nice odor.  I let it sit on for the recommended time and washed off. After washing it off...oh my.. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my face was.  I love it!  It&#x27;s so easy I will be doing this twice a week like the easy directions state.  Will definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Skin feels smooth and refreshed after use.  Slightly minty which gives a subtle tingling sensation (that I personally love in products).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveda&#x27;s cooling mask for several years now and I have to say this mask is so much better. It not only smells amazing but makes your skin feel so refreshed during and afterwards.</li>
    <li> Finally got a chance to try this mask last night. As soon as I started rinsing it off, I noticed my skin felt really good. And today I can&#x27;t stop touching it, lol. It&#x27;s very soft and feels moisturized (I also put on the Beauty by Earth Argan oil this morning). I love it! I also like that when the mask dried it didn&#x27;t just crumble off my face and make a mess, which I have experienced with other masks in the past.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this face mask. It is very light and gentle. I love that it doesn&#x27;t crack on your skin - which shows you just how hydrating it really is! The ingredients are organic and so good for your skin! It&#x27;s definitely a must-have staple to a weekly skin care routine. This is a refreshing, hydrating and cooling mask that is perfect for the upcoming spring and summer time when your skins needs a break from all the heavy winter creams. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use face masks at all because they leave a nasty film afterwards. With this product I got to try for the purpose of review. After getting it today I tried the product tonight. There was no film afterwards and did a very good job on shrinking my pours. It left my skin feeling so great. I am also glad their it is all natural and no harmful chemicals in the product. I would very much say this is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best face masks I have tried to date.  I find that some lower quality masks really dry out my face and lead to other skin issues.  This mask did not do that and I highly recommend this for anyone who has sensitive skin like I do.</li>
    <li> TRYING AGAIN SINCE MY REVIEW DID NOT SHOW UP ON AMAZON. WHAT&#x27;S UP WITH THAT?? The seller contacted me and appeared to comment on my review. But it&#x27;s not there. This is deceptive and the overall rating is not accurate if negative reviews do not get posted.   It&#x27;s too bad this has an overpowering patchouli smell, because the mask is helpful for my skin. But the scent is a deal breaker. Patchouli makes me feel nauseous. UGH!   It is the description (and ingredient list) that drew me to this product twice. I wish the description mentioned the patchouli scent!  I do like the other Beauty By Earth products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh as well as tightens up my pores. Love the smell and how easy it is to apply and remove. Will definitely become part of my cleaning arsenal.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of facial masks but I loved the way this one made my face feel! I loved the tingling feeling after I put it on. After I washed it off,  my skin looked so much more vibrant and healthy.  Would def recommend!</li>
    <li> This mask it great! It does not sting or burn when you put it on!! It&#x27;s soft and easy to apply and to take off.&lt;br /&gt;Saw a huge difference in my skin right after.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have tried many face masks in the past but never found one that I felt made a difference but this experience was completely different. After just one use my skin felt and looked cleaner. It removed all my makeup and cleared up my pimple. After a couple uses my pores look smaller and my skin feels smoother. Also love that the company makes organic and natural products. I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like hydrating masks because most make my face feel tight and dried out.  This one however left my face feeling soft and clean, not at all dry.  Great product.</li>
    <li> okay i received this for a review  and i am in love with this company i got their lip balm also and I LOVE THIS STUFF i love the consistency and the smell is great!</li>
    <li> I used the Beauty by Earth mask and my face feels smooth. The mask smells good when you apply it and dries quickly. Another great Beauty by Earth product that works for me!</li>
    <li> This facial mask is easy to apply and easy to wash off. It smells so good! After use my skin felt refreshed and soft - it still felt soft the next day. This is a great product, it works well, is gentle on my skin, and smells great. Everything I wanted from a facial mask!</li>
    <li> Best facemask!!! My kids and I love it! It works so well and I could feel my face completely hydrated right after using it!</li>
    <li> After using it once- made my skin a little oily. It does smell good and refresh my skin.</li>
    <li> Clears blackheads also! I love this mask!! Only takes a few minutes to dry, comes off easily and makes your face feel great!</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product and we use it often</li>
    <li> Very, very empress with Beauty of Earth product... Loved the smell of the cucumber clay masked... My face is so cool and refreshed after I applied ... Can&#x27;t wait do it again...</li>
    <li> Received this as a product review. It&#x27;s made my skin a little smoother then what it used to be. Haven&#x27;t had a chance to do it long term yet. I rarely use any products on my face because I break out with pretty much anything.  But with this, I do like what the outcome is so far.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this product I felt a difference in my skin/ It honestlly felt like I had new skin on my face! This one is something that I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Great product! The granules are nice, small and fine enough to really get into your pores. Your face feels super refreshed after. I tend to use this when I want a more deep cleanse then a normal cleanser would give me.</li>
    <li> Smells nice &amp; leaves face soft.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR PROVIDING AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
    <li> This mask is wonderful! I waited to review until I had tried it twice. It goes on very smooth and feels so good. It&#x27;s very refreshing and even when it has dried, it feels and smells nice. It rinses away easily and doesn&#x27;t feel like anything is left behind, just clean, smooth skin. My face is already feeling and looking better, with smaller pores over my nose. I willdefinitely keep using this.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I both used this product and absolutely loved it.  When you put it on it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or clumpy. It feels nice and relaxing. We left it on for the recommended time and then washed it off. The feeling afterwards was amazing!  My skin felt so smooth and hydrated. It didn&#x27;t feel dry at all. Days later, my skin still feels great!  I highly recommend this mask.</li>
    <li> Great is all I can say!</li>
    <li> I think it is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this face mask! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, a little goes a LONG way, it smells wonderful, and I appreciate the natural ingredients! My 5 year old loves it, too :)</li>
    <li> I love this mask it leaves you face nice and smooth and it feels revitalizing!</li>
    <li> Wow!! This product  made my face GLOW! I received  so many  compliments.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and my skin feels better.</li>
    <li> As always, I love their products and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint. It&#x27;s nice that it comes in a small tube abs not a giant jar. I don&#x27;t have much counter space so that made me happy. But I will say that a little goes a long way. I did my entire face and neck and barely made a dent in the tube. I&#x27;ll probably be able to get 10-15 masks out of it. It goes on smoothly and has a pleasant smell. It too about 15 minutes to fully dry (on the meantime I scared the crap out of my kids and dog). It has a refreshing tingle as it was working and was easy to wipe off. My face felt really soft and well moisturized afterwards. Added bonus was that I had some peeling skin from a sunburn that came off with the mask. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of facial masks in general, but I really like this product. It leaves my skin feeling like velvet, and a tube of it lasts such a long time. I&#x27;m still on my first one. Great product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin to begin with  so I am in the market searching for a natural and gentle facial mask which not only cleanses but soothes my skin. This  mask seems to do that for the first time when it was used  on my face. I have a few mild breakout spots on my cheek areas and forhead which seem to look less irritated after removing the mask. So for this week one of trying it out  I will give 4*</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the way my skin feels after this mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a weird mixture of dry skin on my forehead and cheeks while my nose is oily. I have a hard time finding a mask that can handle both. My skin feels clean and not tight like it has after other masks. It also feels and smells very natural. I am getting one for my mom to try!</li>
    <li> I have only used this a couple times so far but  I love the way it makes my skin feel, all nice and clean with no residue that some other masks do!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and the facial mask goes on smooth and washes off easily. I&#x27;ve been looking for a quality facial mask for my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m glad I bought this one!</li>
    <li> I did receive this as a giveaway and it works awesome!  My face felt very soft after the first use.  It applies nicely.  The packaging is great.  The smell and feel is wonderful.</li>
    <li> i really liked this facial mask..&lt;br /&gt;1) It is organic&lt;br /&gt;2) It is gentle (though there was a slight tingly feeling when I first applied it)&lt;br /&gt;2) It has a great consistency (Not too thick. Not too runny)&lt;br /&gt;4) It feels surprisingly light on your skin (Not heavy or mucky like some of the other facial masks)&lt;br /&gt;5) It does not dry out your skin once washed off, and it leaves your face feeling fresh and clean&lt;br /&gt;6) It has a pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;I have used many face masks over the years. This is the first one that I rinsed off any my skin felt AMAZING! It was so soft &amp; smooth! The morning after it still felt great! I will defiantly tell all my friends about this product!! Keep up the good work! I&#x27;m lookin forward to trying more of your organic beauty products! THIS IS A A+ FOR SURE....</li>
    <li> I love this mask! I had purchased it along with the lip balm. I love both of these products.  The mask is so light and doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling than many others do.</li>
    <li> Very good skin product</li>
    <li> My skin looks great!!  It&#x27;s bright and clean and I&#x27;m glowing.  I have to say I&#x27;m usually a skeptic when it comes to face products.  I&#x27;ve used so many.  But this product really worked and made my skin naturally glow &amp; clean.  It&#x27;s also pretty affordable.  Worth trying.</li>
    <li> I got this face mask because it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.  A little goes a long way and it smells great. Left my face feeling great. I have used several of Beauty by Earth products and hve enjoyed them all.</li>
    <li> I love this mask plus I have super delicate skin I had no reaction with this mask... I first used it has a facial mask and then throughout the week as a spot treatment it made the acne get smaller right away and then next day almost all gone!</li>
    <li> Really great mask! My skin felt so clean and soft..thank you!</li>
    <li> wonderful product!! love it during the long dry winters.  keeps my skin so soft. this company makes exceptional products for the skin and lips!!</li>
    <li> Great packaging. Love the smell very fresh, very strong smell. Maybe tea tree oil? Birch tree? Washed off clean. My skin feels great. I&#x27;d suggest giving it a try. I&#x27;m excited I still have so much left! Great portion.</li>
    <li> This product works very well and helps remove the excess oil from my skin after a long workout. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face fresh will order again</li>
    <li> Refreshing and hides some of my wrinkles after washing off.  LOVE THIS!</li>
    <li> This face mask is excellent! I have very sensitive skin that frequently will burns and becomes irritated when using other facial masks, but this mask didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all! In fact, my skin was super soft afterwards. I totally recommend this product for anyone out there looking for a good face mask that doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin and does a great job at cleaning your face!</li>
    <li> Well this mask was a total surprise.  Received for evaluation and review, I expected something specifically for acne and oily skin.  It certainly has a visible clearing effect on my face but what totally blew me away is the hydrating and nourishing action.  It&#x27;s one of the easiest to use masks I&#x27;ve ever tried and I love using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is thickly creamy, it&#x27;s a dream to spread, it sticks exactly where you put it, does not clump or fall off.  It works best if you open the pores first by applying a warm, moist towel.  You don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your face, in fact it would be a waste to pile it on too thickly.  After 15-20 minutes, when the mask is visibly dry, it&#x27;s equally easy to remove with warm water and a beauty sponge, ideally in the shower but not necessarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recipe is an inspired mix of natural but powerful ingredients:  Kaoline and Bentonite Clays (to draw out impurities and re-mineralize tired skin), Algae extracts (to detoxify and feed), Cucumber extract (soothing and hydrating), Calendula extract and Aloe Vera (healing and skin repair agents), Caprylic and Lauric Acids (to replenish moisture and fight inflammation and infection).  So use it to help your acne, if you wish, but I&#x27;m using it to rejuvenate and refresh my fragile, mature skin.  No sensitivity or drying out, my skin emerges fresh and smooth.  The aroma is clean and delicious, perfectly suitable for male faces who can benefit greatly from this supremely cleansing treatment.  The presentation is earthy and appealing, 120 ml in a good-size tube of soft plastic, perfect for squeezing the small amount needed (about the size of a large grape).  This is one of the test products that I will buy again once my sample is finished.</li>
    <li> Love it! Leave my face feel and look smooth</li>
    <li> Well, honestly, I am surprised at how much I ended up loving this mask! I&#x27;ve used many masks before but they always ended up making my face feel super dry and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;But not this mask. When I applied the mask, the smell was a very natural smell, very herby which I loved. All natural products which was a double bonus!&lt;br /&gt;When I rinsed off the mask, my skin was SUPER soft and moisturized. My skin stayed like that all day. I didn&#x27;t even have to put lotion on after or anything. I was totally shocked, coming from always having dried out skin after using any mask.  And I have used A LOT! And for that, I am in LOVE with this mask.&lt;br /&gt;I am also thrilled with it because now I feel 100% confident that my daughter can use this too with me and we can have a girly mask night without me worrying it will ruin her skin! :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! Such an awesome product! Happy I found it because it&#x27;s definitely replacing my older mask products! Yay! Super excited!!</li>
    <li> First of all I have to say how impressed I was with the packaging of this product. It was very simple and clean and I could tell that I had purchased a great product. I have tried several facial masks in the past and have never been really wowed. This however was a totally different experience! This mask smells AMAZING. I felt like I was at the spa, which is always a good feeling! When I applied it to my face it had a nice tingling effect and felt really soothing. After just one use it has left my skin very smooth, moisturized and my pores are tighter. I will absolutely order this face mask again and I would recommend it to everyone!!!!</li>
    <li> The ingredients are all natural and has really made a difference in my skin! I ordered this a little over a month and now I am finally doing a review. It really made my skin feel clean. I normally wear makeup almost everyday, and this facial has made my skin have a natural glow and looks so hydrated! I highly  recommend this product</li>
    <li> I love how great my face feels when using the Earth By Beauty Clear Complexion Mask . When applying to my face it feels so cool and refreshed . I love how my face feels afterwards . I recommend this to anyone that needs  their pores to their  face and neck area cleaned plus rejuvenated . This is my opinion  and I got this product as a review .</li>
    <li> This mask goes on smooth, making it easy to apply.  It feels cool upon application.  It has a pleasant light minty cucumber and grass scent. After rinsing, my entire face felt soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. I worked on the black heads that I had on my checks and nose.. I will be buying this product again. I had no ideal what it could do and never had anything that would work on my face like this. I think and feel and anyone who buys it will also fall in love with it also.</li>
    <li> After applying this I noticed that my skin was much smoother. I have used other products that have irritated my skin but this one didn&#x27;t. I will keep this as one of my routines with my skin. I feel like I went and had a facial after I used it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this face mask!!! I love the fresh natural smell and that way my face feels when I wash it off. I wish the company made more face cleaning products! I would buy them in a heart beat :)</li>
    <li> Works and smells GREAT.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love that it has organic ingredients and that it is soy free and that it is made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Amazing mask! I love the natural feel and how hydrated my skin feels right after every use, it&#x27;s like a glass of water for my face! I have seen a dramatic change!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used more products than I could ever recount.  This facial mask is great!  I love the results, the price and the natural ingredients.  I will recommend to friends and will include it in my facial cleansing regimen from now on.</li>
    <li> Sent to me for review this facemask is made of a significant amount of natural organic ingredients and can either be used as part of a skin maintenance / preventing treatment or to treat well known skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s presented in a standard 120ml plastic tube and the ingredients and instructions are well documented on the exterior. Admittedly I was overwhelmed with how many different natural ingredients were present and these include organic aloe vera leaf juice extract, bentonite clay, vegetable glycerin, organic shea butter, organic jojoba oil, algae extract, organic cucumber extract and organic caldendula extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is grey in colour and has a thick consistency. This is not always the case with all facemasks as I have used some that are far too runny, even after shaking it before use. The thickness on this is ideal as it allows you to spread it on your face and neck without it running down. The scent is pleasant although you can&#x27;t really smell it that much when it&#x27;s on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spreading a thin layer of it on my face (after exfoliating my face with a sponge) I waited 15 mins before removing it gentle with a sponge and washing it off - as with most other face masks it left my face looking shinier, healthier and more vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than applying it and waiting around for 15 mins I added it just after cleaning my body and face with a bath sponge and applied the mask so for that 15 mins I was just sitting in the bath keeping warm and relaxing listening to music. After the 15 mins was up I removed what was left under the shower and then washed my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It has very easy instructions and goes on very nicely. Its creamy and smooth so its easy to apply. Other masks I&#x27;ve tried in the mast were very messy and too thick to spread. It has an amazing smell and tingling feel as its drying. After 10-15 mins I washed it off and my face felt great, super soft and fresh. I love that its organic and natural.</li>
    <li> I have used this mask twice now. After both uses, my skin felt so soft and clean. I can already see that it is helping my skin!</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a month ago and have used it about 5 or 6 times and I love it so far. I have sensitive skin and currently breastfeeding my child, so I needed to find something that worked with the hormonal imbalances that can occur. So far so good. It is hydrating enough to keep my skin feeling supple, cleanses my skin and lastly I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with possible  breakouts. Very easy to apply and wipe/rinse off.</li>
    <li> Worked great I could see a difference after the first use. Purchased with a discount but I will be a steady user of this product now. Washed off easily didn&#x27;t leave that weird coated feeling on my skin. I have sensitive skin and this product did not cause any problems.</li>
    <li> love this product... usually i have a hard time finding facial masks that i can use that dont break out my very sensitive skin. this left my skin feeling smooth , fressh  and blemish free!! will definitely continue using it!! thanks so much</li>
    <li> I love how this facial mask doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin since it is so sensitive. It cleans my skin so well when I use it.</li>
    <li> My skin feel great after I use this mask.  It is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells lavender fresh. Adds hours of sleep to your face when you travel or for any reason sleep deprived. I take it everywhere I go in the world.</li>
    <li> I have had oily skin all my life and generally avoid anything that says &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34;, because it&#x27;s normally oily and makes my skin condition worse. However, I was encouraged to order this because of its natural ingredients. I used it in the evening before bed. My skin was soft and smooth and not at all greasy, and also not dry like my normal masks would do. I finished my normal evening routine. This morning my skin is still soft, didn&#x27;t break out, and still not oily. This is now my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love this face mask!!! My face has been so dry from the winter wind. After using the mask my face felt hydrated for days.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin (eczema and bad allergies) so I&#x27;m very wary of trying new skin care products. I did a patch test and did not react so I was off to a good start. The mask did not get super tight and uncomfortable like some others I&#x27;ve tried and no burning or itching. After rinsing it off my skin felt very soft and clean. I liked it so much I made my cousin come over so that we could do the mask together. She has really bad acne and she claims it really calmed down the redness for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend for anyone with sensitive skin that wants to treat themselves. Just be sure you do a patch test!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mask! It really helps to bring out the radiant glow and truly brings a lot of trapped dirt and build up to the surface all without stinging or burning, will be purchasing more soon!</li>
    <li> A light weight product that works great without irritating my skin. So glad to have found Beauty by Earth and even better that its gluten free!</li>
    <li> Great product. It is similar to an Origins mask which is great.&lt;br /&gt;Keep up these new products -- they are great!</li>
    <li> This mask was very refreshing and I like the fact that it used all natural organic ingredients. I felt the effect on my skin right after washing it off. Felt nice and smooth. I will definitely continue using this as part as my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! It has a very light and refreshing scent. When I put it on it gave a cooling sensation and reminded me of being at the spa. I can imagine that during the summer months this mask will be my best friend. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been able to use the mask three times now.  The tingling sensation when you put it on is lovely, you can feel it working.  I am one of those people who when I use any product that moistens my face, I break out. It&#x27;s  been that way my whole life.  But this products doesn&#x27;t have that effect!  Finally a product I can use.</li>
    <li> I loved using the hydrating face mask.  I felt the effects immediately on my skin. I really like that it&#x27;s all natural  and an  organic product.</li>
    <li> I love buying products that are made in the U.S. and that are not tested on animals.  The fact that this product contains only natural and organic ingredients makes it that much better.  I love how gentle this mask is, and how it does not irritate my skin.  It leaves it feeling refreshed and baby soft.  I have a sister who is allergic to anything with a fragrance, and I urged her to try this.  She was really nervous, because she has never found anything that did not irritate her skin.  Amazingly (to her), this product made even her skin feel soft and &#x27;alive&amp;#34; (as she called it).  I was able to purchase this at a special price so I could try it, and am so glad I did.  It truly is the first product that works for my sister, which makes me feel comfortable recommending this highly to anyone, even those with sensitive skin.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this company.  They make fantastic products that my sensitive skin loves.  My skin has never been clearer or softer!  I&#x27;ve already recommended them to family and friends.  Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> It Made my face feel so clean i love the feeling.</li>
    <li> Only been using a week but the mask is easy to use and soothing to the skin...leaves your skin smoother! Haven&#x27;t seen much change in my skin so far so will update in a months time :)</li>
    <li> You only need a little bit of this mask to cover your whole face. It goes on smooth and dries in 10-15 minutes. The mask is unscented with any additional fragrance. It has nice natural smell that is earthy and not overpowering. It tingles a little, but it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable or too intense. It rinsed of easily and didn&#x27;t make a huge mess in my sink. My skin didn&#x27;t feel too dry or tight after use. I hate when you use a mask and your face feels  super tight after. This left my skin a little dry, but very smooth.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product especially being my skin is naturally oily and my pores continuously feel clogged.  After just one use, I LOVED the way my face felt.  Thank you so much..:)</li>
    <li> A great mini facial for busy people! I love it. I have a job &amp; 2 small kids and no time for myself. I wash my face and put the mask on and it&#x27;s like a mini facial ~ it smells really good, doesn&#x27;t give that &amp;#34;over tight&amp;#34; feeling that some clay masks do. And you don&#x27;t need to moisturize afterward because it&#x27;s a hydrating mask so it leaves your skin feeling soft. It only takes about 5 - 10 mins. It also pulls toxins out and my face was clearer once I started using it.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It left my skin and my brothers skin so soft and fresh, a little dry but that&#x27;s what face cream is for.  My face feels clean and my brothers face is glowing.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it give us good results, but we also had a fun brother sister bonding, it was really hard not to laugh because when we did it would crack the mask and we didn&#x27;t want that. I would definitely be buying more of this mask once I run out.</li>
    <li> Great scent.  Quality product.  Works very well!!</li>
    <li> I love this mask. Makes my face so soft and smooth but not drying. Seems to exfoliate and clean my pores well. All natural ingredients. Smell is amazing. No chemicals or chemical smell. Must be the cucumber and calendula that make it smell so addicting!!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful mask! My face feels absolutely lovely from it, very smooth and hydrated and smells delicious, I&#x27;d love to cover my whole body with it. Also very happy with the ingredients, (as with all of their products) nothing to worry about! Beautifully packaged as well I should add :)</li>
    <li> I used this mask for the first time a couple of nights ago.  It went on easily, smelled pretty good, and left my skin feeling clean, tightened, and toned.  It also easily washed off which I appreciated.  I could really feel the mask working while I wore it and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause me to breakout which is usually the problem I have and the reason I don&#x27;t use masks much.  I will definitely be using this every week.</li>
    <li> Hello fabulousness. I&#x27;m in love and fully obsessed with this mask. And it&#x27;s organic, gluten- and soy-free. Wow. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I was interested to see how this product would work with my skin as I tend to have very sensitive skin and it tends to be picky about what I put on it.  Well after using it my skin felt great and clean.  There was a noticeable difference in how it looked and felt.  I had no adverse reaction to it at all.  I love that it is all natural.  Definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent mask! I love the moisturizing property of this cleanser. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! You only need a small&lt;br /&gt;Amount so the bottle lasts a long time! You get a tingly sensation when applied, which is nice. The smell is pleasant but not overpowering. The clay leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this mask. She did find that it was a bit strong around her eyes though so she is careful in applying it and uses it more sparingly then some of her other products. Definitely recommends using it for spot treatments or when your skin is a bit oily. If you have sensitive skin or drier skin you&#x27;ll want to be careful but if you need a deep clean this is definitely a great way to go. Keep in mind this is a deep clean and be a bit more careful with application and you should love it.</li>
    <li> I love this and the fact it&#x27;s organic is even better .. going to be a must have for me</li>
    <li> This mask smells great, and was so hydrating and gentle on my skin. My skin still felt soft the next day!</li>
    <li> what an amazing Product.  I have used it for several days nowner on my dry face and it feels and looks so much better!! I will definitely be ordering again! Great product for busy people because it&#x27;s quick simple and leaves your skin very refreshing!</li>
    <li> This makes my face feel fantastic afterwards!  It is addicting!</li>
    <li> Does not cause over drying and its easy to wash off</li>
    <li> Really nice. Feels good...</li>
    <li> I gave this product to a friend and she is in love with it. Says it leaves her face nice and smooth</li>
    <li> This mask is light and refreshing. It cleanses and tightens pores well. I have fair skin that gets irritated easily. I like the fact that it is organic and produced by a small company. So far it is a winner.</li>
    <li> perfectly potent! Not irritating, it has just enough of all the right things to really deep clean without irritation.</li>
    <li> This facial mask is wonderful.  My skin is now softer and so much clearer than before.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, my wife loves it!</li>
    <li> My skin looks nice after using this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My skin has never been better.</li>
    <li> I was worried this mask would burn and sting and leave my face feeling ashy, like all the other bentonite clay masks I&#x27;ve tried thus far, but it was very gentle and my skin looked radiant afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m kinda hooked now. Using it every other day!</li>
    <li> This mask smells good, is very relaxing to use, and did not dry out my skin. Most masks totally dry out my skin, so this was a huge plus. My skin is softer and pores are visibly smaller after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just put a nice warm washcloth on the skin to open the pores, then apply the mask, relax and wait about 15 minutes, then remove with warm water and a cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, if you&#x27;re a full time mom like me, you quickly apply the mask as your 10 month old  baby tugs at your clothes, then spend the next 15 minutes playing &amp;#34;monster&amp;#34; because your 4 year old is convinced that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re wearing &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; on your face. So that you can play monster. Sure. The nice thing is that it didn&#x27;t get itchy as it dried around the edges, and I wasn&#x27;t running to take it off - I walked leisurely to the sink, with the baby hanging onto my pant leg and my 4 year old screaming, &amp;#34;Chase me! Chase me, monster!&amp;#34;, and calmly picked up a washcloth to take off the face mask. I wish I couid tell you that while the mask was in use, a hush fell over the house, palm trees grew out of the floor and cool sea breezes started up, waving the white cloth of a cabana.... But it came pretty close. ;-) Needless to say, I&#x27;ll be using this about twice a week.</li>
    <li> 100 percent natural ingredients.  Loved how smooth my face felt after the mask. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> What an amazing find! It was difficult for me to find something online, or in stores,  that I felt I can trust rubbing into the skins of my grandchildren. I&#x27;ve always opted out on the usage of sunscreen. But, our planet is getting warmer &amp; I couldn&#x27;t continue to minimize my grandchildren&#x27;s play time outside. This item is thick so I only use a small amount &amp; it&#x27;s odorless. The kids love it &amp; I feel better for buying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a stickler for Face Masks with chemicals or ingredients I do not understand. When this product became available for me to purchase with a discount code, of course I took advantage! This face mask so gentle on my sick! Leaves it nice and refreshed. I use this about 3 times a week and I can already tell that my skin is becoming softer. Will definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Causing breakouts in my oily t-zone area...</li>
    <li> I really like this facial mask. I have tried a few in the past, and a lot of them were either too harsh or didn&#x27;t do much. Here&#x27;s why I liked it:  1) It is organic 2) It is gentle (though there was a slight tingly feeling when I first applied it) 2) It has a great consistency (Not too thick. Not too runny) 4) It feels surprisingly light on your skin (Not heavy or mucky like some of the other facial masks) 5) It does not dry out your skin once washed off, and it leaves your face feeling fresh and clean 6) It has a pleasant smell  At first I was a little disappointed with the size of the product. However, a little goes a long way when applying it on and you only need to use it once or twice a week, so it should last a while. Be sure not to apply it too close to your eyes!</li>
    <li> This face mask has worked so well. I have VERY sensitive skin. But no breakouts when I use Beauty by Earths products, the face mask continues that tradition.</li>
    <li> I love beauty by earth products! My first expression of the mask was that It was smaller than I expected. Although when I began using the mask I realized that a little bit goes a long way, a thin layer all over the skin is all you need! This mask is better than any other mask I Used before, it is not sticky and feels nice on the skin. After washing my skin  my skin feel feels hydrated and soft. I&#x27;m definitely buying another after I run out!!</li>
    <li> I am in Vegas and it is so. dry, this is what i needed cleanses without drying.  My face feels new and clean.  Smell is noce.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, worked great on my acne.</li>
    <li> Love the face mask, makes me feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> Awesome, I love it!&lt;br /&gt; I am always on the look out for a natural product like this. I saw an immediate difference after using this mask.&lt;br /&gt;My face looked brighter, tighter and fresh. What lady doesn&#x27;t want that!! It also does hydrate my face wasn&#x27;t dry after like some masks are. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> great product. i bought this companies lip balm a while back and loved it, then i noticed they have been coming out with more products. so i bought them. i am happy with the results. it feels good. it all natural. can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product as I have adult acne and it is helping I believe! GREAT natural ingredients and the price is good with me as it lasts a long time used biweekly. Very happy with this. My favorite beauty product I believe!</li>
    <li> My skin is like silk after I use this. Its great for a once a week use.</li>
    <li> What I like the most about it is that it&#x27;s organic. It has a lot of benefits since it contains aloe vera and cucumber. I applied it on my itchy and irritated face and it heals immediately after just one application. I love the smell too</li>
    <li> Love this product, having an autoimmune disease my skin is very sensitive. Works great feels great.</li>
    <li> My son bought this for me as a gift and I LOVE it.  Often masks are simply too harsh for my mature skin, but this one is not.  I felt it tighten and cleanse, both at the same time--5 stars!</li>
    <li> This mask is a nice combo of hydrating and pore cleansing.  It&#x27;s soothing to the skin when I apply it (many masks actually sting my sensitive skin when first applied). It has a great calendula smell.  The clay in it does a nice job of extracting pores.  My skin felt soft after using it.  This is a great pampering mask.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this and it didn&#x27;t let me down. Smells wonderful and made my face feel so good afterwards. Can&#x27;t wait to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a month ago. I didn&#x27;t want to review it until I fully tried it. And I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s a great product. I used to use this $2 face mask from Walmart until I realized how many chemicals were in it. It helped but I broke out eventually and never used it again. Sat on my sink because I was too cheap to throw it out so I used it once a month. Then I tried Beauty by Earth&#x27;s face mask and not only does it not contain the 15+ chemicals the one from Walmart did, it felt like it was actually helping my skin. I did not break out once from this product and I have a tendency to break out very easily with any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly love this company. I have a routine with their Konjac sponge, this, and their toner and I used to use their Argan oil as my moisturizer but I ran out and now using almond oil but I think their Argan oil worked a little better, haha. It&#x27;s a little costly for all three but worth it. I&#x27;m definitely going to be a dedicated customer from now on. Just waiting on that tinted sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I have only used this once so far but I really like how it went on and dried like a mud mask. I like the idea of it drawing toxins out of my face. Curious to see how long term use will play out. I have extremely dry and sensitive skin and so far it seemed to help a little. Will update with any changes.</li>
    <li> Even though it promised to be hydrating, I found that the mask actually did more &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34;, which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, but not exactly what I was hoping for.  I love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s organic though!</li>
    <li> Most amazing product i have used. My skin feels amazing!!</li>
    <li> I have used several masks.  Some of them I can&#x27;t even leave on my face long enough because they actually hurt my skin.  I loved the feel of this.  It was refreshing with just a little mint tingle.  When I washed it off my face felt very soft.  I love the fact that it is all natural.  Since skin is the largest organ of our body it is vital to know what you are putting on it - because it is going in your body.  So many skin care products contain chemical perfumes, even petroleum based products.  But this is 100% natural and you can feel it.</li>
    <li> Update 06.19.16: I tried a couple of other masks after trying this one but none of them compare to this mask. So I came back recently to purchase this at full price (after my previously discounted purchase) and I saw a differently packaged product. I was hesitant to buy the mask- may be they had changed the formula or composition along with the packaging but decided to buy it anyway since I had a wonderful experience with the mask previously. I was so glad to find that they did not mess with the formula, I got the same results- beautifully hydrated soft skin with NO irritation or tightness! This mask is definitely one of the regular items in my beauty routine and I highly recommend giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty by Earth Clear Complexion Hydrating Facial Mask is indeed a 100% Natural and Organic Treatment for Acne, Deep Pore Cleansing for Face &amp;amp; Spot Treatment. I love how it refreshes my skin and makes it so soft and smooth. The ingredients hydrate my skin without leaving it dry or chapped. Will purchase more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;**Item purchased at discounted pricing for testing and reviewing purposes**</li>
    <li> I really like this face mask. I can&#x27;t speak on its effectiveness on acne, but since using it my skin does seem to be more even. After rinsing it off my skin was so soft and smooth! The description says it is unscented, but I found it to have a nice herbal smell which I really enjoyed. And this mud mask has a better texture/consistency than any other mud mask I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ll have to try it a few more times to see how it holds up on its acne fighting claims, but so far this is a product I really like.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin - leaves my skin feeling hydrated.  Love the all natural pure, organic ingredients. It is unscented, which is nice for a change.  I&#x27;d recommend this facial mask and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Mask is light and washes off easily leaving your skin soft does not dry it out like other masks</li>
    <li> I love this, it works great and gets rid f all those black heads you hate.</li>
    <li> Ive received several products by his same company and have been thoroughly impressed each time. Having natural organic ingredients is very important to me and having something that is effective and does what its supposed to do is also very important. Thats why I love this product. It went on very smoothly and just felt very nice. I noticed great results from just the first try (skin was very clean and smooth). I am very happy with this product and can&#x27;t wait for my weekly mask :). (this is Andrew&#x27;s wife writing the review)</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel soft and smooth. Nice smell as well!</li>
    <li> love this product very much. i ve got it as promotion. it took me a few weeks to try it and made my opinion. now i can say for sure this mask is amazing. i ve never used masks before because didn t like any of them. this one is truly fantastic. highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Another amazing product from Beauty by Earth! My incredibly sensitive acne-prone skin is responding very well to this mask. I am seeing more even tone, and fewer breakouts.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my face and i have been using this since it arrived.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> It was so nice to finally find a mask that doesn&#x27;t go on feeling oddly gritty. My daughter and I tried this together, because we have different skin types. I am older. My skin is normal without blemishes with a few small dry spots. My teenage daughter is exactly what you would expect from that age. She&#x27;s oily and have small breakouts in her T zone.  Now for the application. There&#x27;s very little smell, which is nice for me. Too much odor, even a pleasant one, can make the drying experience bothersome. We followed the directions, placing a warm damp towel on our faces until it cooled before application. The mask went on smooth and creamy. It dried within the 15 minute time suggested, but not crackling dry. It felt firm not flaky. Neither of us experienced itching or tingling, It was just relaxing. This isn&#x27;t a peeling mask. It&#x27;s muddy, so you&#x27;ll have to wash. We both opted for warm water and followed up the experience with the rose water tonic this company sells.  Results. Maybe it was wishful thinking but it seems like my face feels more even. Some of my wrinkles seem less obvious. I felt refreshed. My daughter was not expecting much but was amazed. Her skin visibly cleared over the next few days. (It should be noted again, that she has small blemishes scattered through the T zone, not a full face of larger more intense blemishes that some teens can suffer with). I&#x27;ve lost my bottle, to my daughter that now applies a mask about once a week. When she sees an outbreak coming on, she announces her intentions to plan time for a mask. So far, we&#x27;ve gotten 4 treatments out of the bottle with probably only one more thin one left. Clearly, we&#x27;ll be reordering.  I would also like to make a not of the company customer service. How a company treats me has a very important roll in who I give my money too. I was contacted after the product shipped, with some greatly informative emails about the facial mask and how to use it. Communications were very kindly worded and they seem genuinely to believe in what they do. It comes across in the way they treated me.</li>
    <li> Great mask! I am using Aztec clay, which extremely tightens skin, but is pretty rough for skin, I feel like this mask does the same but more gentle. Very nice smell and texture. I love it!</li>
    <li> After using this product for the past 3 weeks, I&#x27;m thrilled to state that this facial mask does what it claims. My experiences with other clay-based masks were that they felt great after the first application (using once per week) but began to dry and irritate my skin after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;This complexion mask leaves my skin so soft without feeling dry and tight. My 13 yr. old has been using it, too, and we&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in her acne-prone skin: controls the oil, yet keeps her skin from drying out and looking red and scaly like other acne products. I find that the mask works best when applied to dry skin versus pre-moistened skin. The other great thing about this mask is it&#x27;s smell: light and clean (mint?). Did I mention that this company has an awesome philosophy regarding their business, how they run it, and it&#x27;s impact on the environment? Great stuff, Beauty by Earth! Keep it coming...</li>
    <li> This face mask is awesome! As overused as that word is, it well describes this. So naturally cleansing. And smells amazing! Makes me wanna eat it. Seriously deep cleanses like you cannot believe. I&#x27;m officially addicted to this stuff. Natural and organic and effective. Can&#x27;t get any better than that! Love anything Beauty by Earth. These guys put out products above the rest.</li>
    <li> This mask was wonderful.  It left my face feeling very soft and very clean.  It really delivered what it said it would and I am delighted with the results.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> i am absolutely in love with the beauty by earth skin care line. It makes my face feel smooth and I love that it&#x27;s all natural :-)</li>
