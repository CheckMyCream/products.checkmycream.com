      <li>Great Product.</li>
      <li>great stuff</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many companies, and hair products offered to me from salons and barber shops, none carry this!</li>
      <li>this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>the more natural your hair will look, even a spritz will hold it in place, its ridiculously awesome!</li>
      <li>and we all love it.  </li>
      <li>It darkens the pastels as I have been told, by many artists, who never spray their pieces, and say that any fixative will do just as Got 2b</li>
      <li>i think i might invest in more.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>cant you tell :)</li>
      <li>I see no reason to spend more.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>daughter has a funky style and uses this product to freeze her hair in bizarre styles - and it stays!  </li>
      <li>The pastels went on perfectly, and had no holding difficulties, and when finished, I made a final coating of this spray, and</li>
      <li>It works as well as products costing much more.  </li>
      <li>Its easy to use and durable.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
      <li>but nothing so strong that it seems like cologne or perfume.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the buy, smells pretty good</li>
      <li>and I appreciate the fine customer service.</li>
      <li>Think about it: you normally would by a different brand at a cheaper price, but use SO many sprays before your hair becomes anything but perfect.</li>
      <li>Fabulous product.</li>
      <li>I just want something that will hold my superfine (</li>
      <li>CHEAP???  </li>
      <li>Super glue of hair spray.  </li>
      <li>The only problem is being able to find it in stores!  </li>
      <li>Could care less, if my light violet is a shade darker, and my sunset went from light yellow to bright orange!  </li>
      <li>its 8 dollars and some but worth it.</li>
      <li>It may seem pricy, but this studio size can is worth every spray.</li>
      <li>As a guy with thick hair who likes it in a faux hawk, this was ideal for myself.</li>
      <li>The price is right</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a super strong product that actually freezes hair in place.  </li>
      <li>Delivery was Fast and Furious!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Asian, and as many Asians know, our hair can be quite stubborn.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more likely that it&#x27;s just one product that they then sell for both a drugstore price and a salon price.  </li>
      <li>and im almost positive</li>
      <li>A bit pricey compared to the cheaper stuff out there, but worth the extra few bucks per can because it is a great product.</li>
      <li>It works really well for me and is a staple in my hair care arsenal.  </li>
      <li>Perfect buy for those who want crazy hair, or just want to style it and need something held in place.</li>
      <li>Fantastic hold for short hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>it takes less than a minute of hair drying to get the spikes to stay and its a very strong hold.</li>
      <li>I used Suave Super Hold then, but when recently, I went shopping, I found Got2b Glued at WallMart.  </li>
      <li>I sprayed the piece with Got2b Glued, and waited ten minutes, and reapplied fresh colors over the problem site.  </li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>I paid $7 for it in my local grocery store, so the Amazon price is really inflated.  </li>
      <li>This by far is the strongest hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>This is one of those low end products that works as well (or is the same exact product as) as Schwartzkopf&#x27;s namesake line.  </li>
      <li>Really like that it keeps my hair the way it want it all day long lasting hold.</li>
      <li>I am a retired illustrator and am getting back into soft pastels since having done them back in 1981 at Idaho State University.  </li>
      <li>im talking about 3-5 inches of hair standing straight up and the wind will not take it down.</li>
      <li>you are a person who tends to touch your hair a lot, it does make it feel like stiffened glue if you saturate your hair too much with this stuff, and sometimes flakes off in little white specks as the day wears on (and you continue to fix/touch your hair).</li>

<li> A great product and no doubt the least expensive place to purchase!!  </li>
<li> I like to spike my hair in a classy way, but it&#x27;s so hard finding a hair product that will cooperate with out</li>
<li> Literally with only a few sprays, this thing will freeze your hair!</li>
<li> And been trying hell a lot of other hair fixing sprays, but this one is THE BEST.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
<li> I dry off my hair, keep it a little moist then spray about 6 inches away.</li>
<li> My hair defies gravity and doesn&#x27;t even care if the wind tries to knock it down.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to imagine that they would make two entirely different products.  </li>
<li> the wind has been blowing against my hair when i ride bike and still wont take it down.</li>
<li> This thing arrived with one of the can&#x27;s nozzle broken (but, since it came with a lot of 3, once i finish the first can, i change the broken nozzle with the one I just finish using, so, problem was solved).</li>
<li> It had the acrylic base used by the most expensive pastel fixatives out there in the art world, but costs 75% less and works terrifically, when needed, and to make corrections or for the final fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Somehow, now, i cant no more have this shipped to France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, talking about the product itself.</li>
<li> once that i&#x27;m not satisfied with it.</li>
<li> Be warned, this is serious hairspray, not for anyone who just needs a little hold</li>
<li> Almost every drugstore carries Got2b as well as Walmart, Target and Ulta, so it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to find.  </li>
<li> No matter how hard the wind blows, it stays still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It was icky!  </li>

<li> I am a pro, and have not seen one bit of color change from my pastels sprayed with Suave 32 years ago, and don&#x27;t expect this to do any worse!  </li>
<li> but lots of it) hair into place without it falling flat and looking pathetic.  </li>

    <li> this hairspray freezes my hair until my next wash!!</li>
    <li> This by far is the strongest hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used. As a guy with thick hair who likes it in a faux hawk, this was ideal for myself. I&#x27;ve gone through many companies, and hair products offered to me from salons and barber shops, none carry this! I dry off my hair, keep it a little moist then spray about 6 inches away. The further back you hold the can the more natural your hair will look, even a spritz will hold it in place, its ridiculously awesome! This needs to be sold in big hair stores! It may seem pricy, but this studio size can is worth every spray. Think about it: you normally would by a different brand at a cheaper price, but use SO many sprays before your hair becomes anything but perfect. With this Got2b spray, your done after 3 sprays LOL. It can hold any hair up trust me! Totally worth the buy, smells pretty good but nothing so strong that it seems like cologne or perfume. Perfect buy for those who want crazy hair, or just want to style it and need something held in place. I guarantee there will be nothing stronger out there...this is the better buy!</li>
    <li> I am a retired illustrator and am getting back into soft pastels since having done them back in 1981 at Idaho State University.  I used Suave Super Hold then, but when recently, I went shopping, I found Got2b Glued at WallMart.  It had the acrylic base used by the most expensive pastel fixatives out there in the art world, but costs 75% less and works terrifically, when needed, and to make corrections or for the final fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a bit of color control problems, with a forest scene with a waterfall.  It was icky!  I sprayed the piece with Got2b Glued, and waited ten minutes, and reapplied fresh colors over the problem site.  The pastels went on perfectly, and had no holding difficulties, and when finished, I made a final coating of this spray, and WOW!  It darkens the pastels as I have been told, by many artists, who never spray their pieces, and say that any fixative will do just as Got 2b Glued .  And then there are those who like myself...Could care less, if my light violet is a shade darker, and my sunset went from light yellow to bright orange!  If you can get my drift!  CHEAP???  YES!  AND....In this case, works just fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True...The pros try to strike fear and trepidation in all that can&#x27;t afford the $29-36.00 so-called Pro Fixatives!  Yes!  I am a pro, and have not seen one bit of color change from my pastels sprayed with Suave 32 years ago, and don&#x27;t expect this to do any worse!  But after all, when viewing a pastel by me the artist 50 years from now, and it has been sprayed with this product, and the art pieces is selling for $50,000, and has a brown or yellow tint...It is still my art, and the person purchasing it isn&#x27;t worried about some discoloration, they are buying the name, and not the fixative!  And I do not expect any adverse reaction to the sprayed pastel painting anyway!</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s go to hairspray for dance completions.  Even a thermonuclear blast isn&#x27;t going to budge your hair with this stuff in it.  Be warned, this is serious hairspray, not for anyone who just needs a little hold</li>
    <li> GREAT SELLER AND GREAT PRICES</li>
    <li> Really like that it keeps my hair the way it want it all day long lasting hold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian, and as many Asians know, our hair can be quite stubborn.  I like to spike my hair in a classy way, but it&#x27;s so hard finding a hair product that will cooperate with out think follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the answer. Literally with only a few sprays, this thing will freeze your hair! I like to pair it with gatsby wax. I&#x27;ll use the wax to shape my hair to how I want it, then utilize got2b to hold the shape in place for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!</li>
    <li> This product is just what I needed.  The price is right and I appreciate the fine customer service. Thanks</li>
    <li> Literally acts like glue.</li>
    <li> Fantastic hold for short hair.</li>
    <li> This is the ULTIMATE hairspray for wig styling.</li>
    <li> No flaking and no shine. Superb hold</li>
    <li> Great Product. Good Price.</li>
    <li> Its easy to use and durable.&lt;br /&gt;Its just like  in description. The air doesn&#x27;t move. Perfect for spiking wigs.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> Super glue of hair spray.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I use it, my son and daughter use it and we all love it.  The only problem is being able to find it in stores!  I suspect others, like me, buy it out when it does come in stock because you don&#x27;t want to run out of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has a funky style and uses this product to freeze her hair in bizarre styles - and it stays!  I just want something that will hold my superfine (but lots of it) hair into place without it falling flat and looking pathetic.  This spray takes care of our styling problems!  You can spray your hair into place and it stays put.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> My hair is now lethal. I&#x27;ve stabbed several people in the eye with my spiky head.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for wig styling and hair! Fabulous product.</li>
    <li> This thing arrived with one of the can&#x27;s nozzle broken (but, since it came with a lot of 3, once i finish the first can, i change the broken nozzle with the one I just finish using, so, problem was solved). But, it probably because of having it shipped to France. Somehow, now, i cant no more have this shipped to France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, talking about the product itself. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years. And been trying hell a lot of other hair fixing sprays, but this one is THE BEST.&lt;br /&gt;Not once that i&#x27;m not satisfied with it. No matter how hard the wind blows, it stays still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best thing is how it can be used as volumizing spray, or finishing spray.</li>
    <li> This hairspray definitely does what it claims.  Once you spray it, your hair is going NOWHERE!!  It&#x27;s a super strong product that actually freezes hair in place.  I use it for updos and for the flyaways I get around my hairline and the nape of my neck when I pull my hair back in a ponytail.  It lasts all day, even in the Florida humidity.  It works really well for me and is a staple in my hair care arsenal.  It works as well as products costing much more.  I paid $7 for it in my local grocery store, so the Amazon price is really inflated.  Almost every drugstore carries Got2b as well as Walmart, Target and Ulta, so it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to find.  This is one of those low end products that works as well (or is the same exact product as) as Schwartzkopf&#x27;s namesake line.  It&#x27;s hard to imagine that they would make two entirely different products.  It&#x27;s much more likely that it&#x27;s just one product that they then sell for both a drugstore price and a salon price.  Schwartzkopf has always made good hair care products and the Got2b line has worked well for me.  I see no reason to spend more.  I definitely recommend this hairspray.</li>
    <li> My hair defies gravity and doesn&#x27;t even care if the wind tries to knock it down. No lingering smell, and works as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a person who tends to touch your hair a lot, it does make it feel like stiffened glue if you saturate your hair too much with this stuff, and sometimes flakes off in little white specks as the day wears on (and you continue to fix/touch your hair). Then again, that shouldn&#x27;t be surprising, considering the name is &amp;#34;Got2b glued&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing. i have thin hair and this will stand every hair on my head up. i now can have mohawks and liberty spikes all i want. im talking about 3-5 inches of hair standing straight up and the wind will not take it down. the spikes stand all day long and my hawks with spikes last forever. my hair is even curled and it straightens and holds everything in place. its 8 dollars and some but worth it. it takes less than a minute of hair drying to get the spikes to stay and its a very strong hold. the wind has been blowing against my hair when i ride bike and still wont take it down. i dont even need to reapply. if i wanted to i could go to sleep and im almost positive i could wake up with spikes.  edit 3/29/15- i slept with the spikes and mohawk up and i woke up with them still in place. great stuff i think i might invest in more.</li>
    <li> A great product and no doubt the least expensive place to purchase!!  Delivery was Fast and Furious!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier....cant you tell :)</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever. A bit pricey compared to the cheaper stuff out there, but worth the extra few bucks per can because it is a great product.</li>
