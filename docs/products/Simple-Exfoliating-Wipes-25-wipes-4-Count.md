<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> We love Simple&#x27;s Refreshing Facial Wash Gel. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in local stores anymore. Amazon and its network of shops is the only way I&#x27;ve been able to track it down.  Both my sister and I have sensitive skin and find it almost impossible to wash our faces with any kind of soap. This cleanser is gentle enough that we can use it daily! I have no idea why they&#x27;ve made this product so hard to find. If you run across it, definitely pick it up and try it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel for several years after switching from a more expensive, high end product.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin, and the price is right.  I was glad to find it on Amazon since I was unable to find it in my local stores.</li>
    <li> I was ready to give it a try, but I think my skin is too sensitive and dry that it did not work for me. I was hoping to take a break from time to time of the expencive Estee and Clinic. No luck!</li>
    <li> I like the cleanser a lot. It cleans but does not strip the skin.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I am on my second one and the product gets EVERYWHERE because of the crappy cap. About half of it is wasted.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve gotten more concerned with all the chemicals in products. Surprisingly, I really like it! My skin feels great, it&#x27;s inexpensive and my husband uses it so one less product to buy.</li>
    <li> I really love Simple refreshing facial wash gel! I love the feel of this wash and how soft it makes my face feel after. I have sensitive skin that gets dry and at times a bit oily and this makes my face feel healthier. I got the lotion moisturizer as well that I will be making a review on too. I think both are great and worth a try! I need to start getting in the habit of taking better care of myself and my skin. Simple face gel and it&#x27;s other product lotion are great things to keep around in the bathroom as a reminder to treat myself to some great beauty products. This is a great buy and I&#x27;m so happy I got a chance to try this. Awesome quality and my products were fragrance free so no weird or strong smells. These products are something everyone can agree on! If you have sensitive skin like me and are reluctant to try any facial products for fear of things going wrong then this would be your answer. 5 stars solid! :]</li>
    <li> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! Why was this product discontinued??! I don&#x27;t wanna go back to looking like a monster! UGH UGH UGH UGH</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever for sensitive skin. Love it. Removes makeup too!</li>
    <li> The only issue I have with this cleanser is that it contains Propylene Glycol which is banned in Europe for its toxicity will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, oily, dehydrated, acne prone, perioral dermatitis prone skin. Therefore i cannot use 90%  of skincare ingredients. This cleanser works for me and I&#x27;ve been using it since it was released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it seems that now it&#x27;s been discontinued in the US., I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in store or online besides Amazon, where the price has doubled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through the ingredients lists of dozens of cleansers to find a replacement and after each one all I can think is &amp;#34;how the hell can anyone use this???&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very sad that this cleanser has been discontinued. It is the best! So don&#x27;t buy it so the price will go down and I can stock up.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It&#x27;s mild, never dries my skin and keeps it clear. I can&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have verrry sensitive skin that gets dry and irritated easily and this washing gel is my holy grail.</li>
    <li> Great facial wash that I used while pregnant. It went on easy and you didn&#x27;t need to use a lot to cover your face. I felt like it really cleaned my face well too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Gets my face clean to the pores, doesn&#x27;t tighten my skin or over dry, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;The Gel has a nice texture and refreshing feel. Having trouble finding on store shelves. Simple has a moisturizing &amp; a foaming wash on shelves, but this products works great for me - I don&#x27;t want to chance irritating my skin or causing break outs which happen even at my age (over 50).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Amazon still has this product, I will order again. I recommend this to anyone with normal or combination or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Favourite facial wash gel. It is thick and makes my face smooth, helps get rid of acne. I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Bit too drying for me. I&#x27;ll be going back to the CeraVe foaming facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great face wash when my face feels dry. But not for makeup removal or when I have a oil face.</li>
    <li> I love Simple&#x27;s line of facial care products, so I ordered this product expecting to get the smooth gel wash, and I also ordered the smoothing scrub from another seller. When my order arrived, I somehow had two of the smoothing scrubs. This seller sent me the wrong item. The sticker the seller has placed on the back of the bottle says refreshing gel wash, but it was put on the wrong product. I tend to use the scrub more, so I didn&#x27;t return it, but if you are purchasing from this seller, make sure you are receiving the correct item.</li>
    <li> I was bummed to see this product no longer available in stores.  It just didn&#x27;t seem to clean like before, I wonder if the formula changed.</li>
