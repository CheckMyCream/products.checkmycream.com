      <li>This brush is great not only for blow straightening, but it also does a great job smoothing frizz without heat aids.</li>
      <li>The brush is as described but makes my hair more staticky.</li>
      <li>prone/curly/wavy hair, and with a hairdryer you will have silky shiney hair with no need for straighten irons :)</li>
      <li>Great, comfortable and just the right size.</li>
      <li>I have medium length fine hair - and my hair stylist recommended this brush for blow outs at home.  </li>
      <li>I have fine frizz</li>
      <li>The diameter is just right for a smooth style.  </li>
      <li>so well my hair dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t overheat.  </li>
      <li>, you dont have a decent hairdryer or your not drying it right :)</li>
      <li>The bristles grab the hair gently and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Useful with handheld blow-dryer.  </li>
      <li>This brush really does what the other posters claim: makes your hair shiny and happy, even on the East Coast.</li>
      <li>My hair is very frizzy.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to manage and leaves you hair shiny after blow dry.</li>
      <li>This is a cheap brush and broke easy after hardly using it.</li>
      <li>My hair dries better with less frizz on the humid days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s frustrating trying to blow-dry short hair, only to have it fly off the brush and end up in some bizarre pattern.  </li>
      <li>but when i got home WOW!</li>
      <li>didnt immediately notice much as professional hairdryer didnt match the states voltage</li>
      <li>The metal center did not get hot like they said</li>
      <li>Received in timely manner, in brand new condition, no surprises with shipping or related.</li>
      <li>The smaller size means less volume, which - for me at least - is a good thing.</li>

    <li> Love this brush!  My hair is very frizzy.  My hair dries better with less frizz on the humid days.</li>
    <li> I have medium length fine hair - and my hair stylist recommended this brush for blow outs at home.  Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it, but it gets tangled every time.  I give up in frustration and just do my bangs.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush while on holidays in the states as i forgot to bring one,&lt;br /&gt;I didnt immediately notice much as professional hairdryer didnt match the states voltage but when i got home WOW! when used with a hairdryer its amasing, i have literally had dozens of people commenting on the shine of my hair, I have lost it somewhere and i can see that my hair is not as shiny anymore so i am on the internet to buy another! I have fine frizz prone/curly/wavy hair, and with a hairdryer you will have silky shiney hair with no need for straighten irons :)&lt;br /&gt;if you dont, you dont have a decent hairdryer or your not drying it right :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s frustrating trying to blow-dry short hair, only to have it fly off the brush and end up in some bizarre pattern.  This 1&amp;#34; diameter brush is the solution.  The bristles grab the hair gently and smoothly.  It also has coating on the longest bristles to prevent snagging and scratching.  Plus, the stem conducts heat so well my hair dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t overheat.  The diameter is just right for a smooth style.  Works great with the Conair 1875 blow dryer.  The handle is comfortable and attractive, and has a hole so you can hang it up.</li>
    <li> It makes blow drying my thick curly hair a lot easier.  The smaller size means less volume, which - for me at least - is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long hair. This brush is great not only for blow straightening, but it also does a great job smoothing frizz without heat aids. I am very satisfied, and I&#x27;m glad I tried this brush!</li>
    <li> Great, comfortable and just the right size. I take it with me when I go to the hairdresser so she can use it when she styles my hair. She like it too.</li>
    <li> Definitely a great roll-brush.  It does not tangle up hair, wet or dry.  Does what you probably expect it to do, and does that well.  Useful with handheld blow-dryer.  Received in timely manner, in brand new condition, no surprises with shipping or related.</li>
    <li> This is horrible if you have fine and soft hair. It just pulls out all my hair and tangles if you try to use it as a curly blowout brush. JUST DONT DO IT.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if my hair is shinier but I like the brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased the brush because Woman&#x27;s Day raved about how good the brush was ... NOT.  The metal center did not get hot like they said so it took longer to get my hair dry and the hairdryer had to be on hottest setting, which is not good for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap brush and broke easy after hardly using it. Can&#x27;t even use it now cause the handle keeps coming off</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and straight but I have A LOT of it. This brush really does what the other posters claim: makes your hair shiny and happy, even on the East Coast. Seems to be made of quality material as well. I would definitely suggest this for others with my hair type!</li>
    <li> It is easy to manage and leaves you hair shiny after blow dry. It helps to distribute heat evenly while drying.</li>
    <li> The brush is as described but makes my hair more staticky.</li>
    <li> Seems go work really good.  Makes your hair seem fuller.</li>
