      <li>The texture is wonderful and it goes a long way.</li>
      <li>The product is definately worth it!!</li>
      <li>One more thing, I am a real customer, did not receive a free product to write a good review.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s smooth and feels good not smelling much like coconut after a bit at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to smell like a coconut, but find that the oil does penetrate, and the smell isn&#x27;t strong and does evaporate over time.  </li>
      <li>It has a smooth and light texture and is easily soaked in the skin.</li>
      <li>The fact that this versatile product can be used for cooking, baking, skin and hair care is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>free</li>
      <li>skin feels super with it, and it is super for oil pulling...</li>
      <li>Also, it does have a mild tooth whitening effect for me and others I&#x27;ve talked to.  </li>
      <li>Not only does my mouth feel refreshing, but my whole body feels healthy!</li>
      <li>My hair and skin are extra dry, so the coconut oil is wonderful for this.</li>
      <li>I got this aroma of fresh cut coconut.</li>
      <li>The quality of this brand is as good as any I have tried and I plan to continue ordering this brand for its low cost and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I placed my order and it arrived right on time.</li>
      <li>I use this every morning right when I wake up and every night before going to sleep.</li>
      <li>Makes the whole mouth feel clean &amp; soothed.  </li>
      <li>Especially good for dried out flaky winter skin (particularly dry fingers/cuticles) and the neck/decolette area.  </li>
      <li>Myself and many other consumers are weary of products full of harmful chemicals or trans fats.</li>
      <li>and I still can&#x27;t believe how much it is helping with the flaking of my skin.</li>
      <li>is the package it just need to be up to date with a better label other</li>
      <li>I love the idea that this is a natural healing product with absolutely no side effects.</li>
      <li>my main reason for buying it was coconut oil pulling</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend either.</li>
      <li>love this product Thanks For The extra one from the 1st one leaking over other products</li>
      <li>and I was well on my way to my new experience.</li>
      <li>The only reason I did not give it 4 stars is because the packaging looks home made (which I guess is great no massive production) and the oil is not &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; any longer which makes it hard for me to scoop it to my mouth.</li>
      <li>would recommend they find a better jar to ship this in as both of my orders thus far have arrived with a small amount of oil leaking from the container...</li>
      <li>This was my first purchase of coconut oil, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to other ones.</li>
      <li>but so far it has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I went from store to store looking for the best brand only to be disappointed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I will definitely continue to use it on my skin and hair and with cooking courtesy of by Natural Walkenhealth .&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great oil, seller spams your e-mail incessantly.</li>
    <li> love this product Thanks For The extra one from the 1st one leaking over other products</li>
    <li> Never knew how versatile this stuff was. I have put it in my hair, in my feet, on my cuticles and even a bit on my cat. He likes the flavor and it&#x27;s good for his digestion and his coat. I have used it as a face moisturizer, it&#x27;s smooth and feels good not smelling much like coconut after a bit at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very pleased user  The fact that this versatile product can be used for cooking, baking, skin and hair care is a huge plus. My hair and skin are extra dry, so the coconut oil is wonderful for this. I imagine people with oily skin might not be able to use it, but that&#x27;s for them to test and decide. When we visit California it is extremely difficult for me to keep my skin moisturized. This product works wonderful. I used it when frying some eggs and baking bread. It worked wonderful with no strange taste. The texture is wonderful and it goes a long way. The amount they give you is a great value for the money. Another huge plus as far as skin care is the wonderful tropical smell. Another plus is the fact it is organic. Myself and many other consumers are weary of products full of harmful chemicals or trans fats. I have tried the product as a supplement too I will definitely continue to use it on my skin and hair and with cooking courtesy of by Natural Walkenhealth .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;So many things to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;The color and aroma are great.&lt;br /&gt;my skin feels super with it, and it is super for oil pulling...</li>
    <li> it just melts in your hands as soon as you get some out of the container and other products of coconut oil stays clumpy as you are trying to rub it in. I use on my face and feet and love it and I also cook with it.  The product is definately worth it!! I will continue to buy this productl and use it.</li>
    <li> The product is really great it&#x27;s great on skin and makes it smooth I use it on my face it makes it very soft and dry free I use this everyday and also want others to buy the only thing I would I really didn&#x27;t care bout is the package it just need to be up to date with a better label other then that is awesome</li>
    <li> The quality of this brand is as good as any I have tried and I plan to continue ordering this brand for its low cost and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend they find a better jar to ship this in as both of my orders thus far have arrived with a small amount of oil leaking from the container...the last actually permeating the shipping box itself even though it was wrapped in a ziploc bag (not sealed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hasn&#x27;t affected quality, but if oil can leak out....what can get in?</li>
    <li> This is amazing coconut oil. It has a smooth and light texture and is easily soaked in the skin. It also has a great scent that is not over powering. This company is also amazing. When my product arrived the box was covered in oil. The owner contacted me, problem solved as to why the seal broke and apologized. There is a lot of pride in this company! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I do not have any other oils to compare it to but so far it has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was hard to get used to the texture at the beginning but I found that if I place the oil under my tongue I do not get the gag reflex. The only reason I did not give it 4 stars is because the packaging looks home made (which I guess is great no massive production) and the oil is not &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; any longer which makes it hard for me to scoop it to my mouth.</li>
    <li> I had heard the benefits of using extra virgin coconut oil and had decided to give it a try. I went from store to store looking for the best brand only to be disappointed. They all seemed to have that rancid smell to them. After searching around I decided to look around online when I came across this product. I read the description about it and just felt like this is the one and decided to give it a try. After all I knew I couldn&#x27;t do any worse than the ones in the store. I placed my order and it arrived right on time. I opened my box anxious to see how this product lived up to my expectations. Unfortunately one of the jars leaked in shipping however this was not a major problem since the jars were in zip lock bags, a very smart thing to do. A little cleanup and I was well on my way to my new experience. I unscrewed the top on the jar and let me tell you that aroma of the coconut oil was heavenly. I got this aroma of fresh cut coconut. I would almost have thought someone was in the next room cutting up a coconut. This product is excellent! No rancid smell what so ever! It&#x27;s very smooth in texture and just a wonderful product. It totally exceeded my expectations. I would not hesitate to recommend this product and I would not hesitate to buy it again. I love it! Shipping was fast and customer service was excellent. No complaints here at all! Thank you for a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> My mom just recived hers and it came open and was alil dirty around the cap outlining .</li>
    <li> Great product. Started pulling about 2 weeks ago and my teeth are definitely whiter!</li>
    <li> This Product is great and exactly as described, very happy with product and will order more again In the future</li>
    <li> Great product!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of coconut oil, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to other ones. I use it every day on my face and it just feels soooooo good. what tickles me is, I don&#x27;t need to buy all the different and so expensive L&#x27;Oreal facial (Eye, Morning,Night) lotions, serums anymore.My face looks so much better now. Pores, lines on upper lips are slowly disappearing.I am troubled with psoriasis and I still can&#x27;t believe how much it is helping with the flaking of my skin. This is a very good product. Will order my second jar soon. One more thing, I am a real customer, did not receive a free product to write a good review. Shame on all Amazon customers who write fake reviews.</li>
    <li> Someone told me about the benefits of &amp;#34;oil pulling&amp;#34; so I chose coconut oil, tried it and am hooked.  Makes the whole mouth feel clean &amp; soothed.  Also, it does have a mild tooth whitening effect for me and others I&#x27;ve talked to.  I don&#x27;t have dental problems, but others who do have greatly benefited from oil pulling.  I have heard it can help sinus problems so I will keep at it to see if it will help mine.  This oil is also wonderful on the skin.  I don&#x27;t want to smell like a coconut, but find that the oil does penetrate, and the smell isn&#x27;t strong and does evaporate over time.  Mix it with your every day hand lotion for added benefit.  Especially good for dried out flaky winter skin (particularly dry fingers/cuticles) and the neck/decolette area.  Of course it can be ingested as well, so I use the &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; oil in my protein shakes.  I love the idea that this is a natural healing product with absolutely no side effects.</li>
    <li> Just love this oil, so many benefits of using it, like the sesame oil its great I just happen to like the taste of this oil better... I would highly recommend either.</li>
    <li> I purchase this coconut oil about 7 months ago and I still have plenty of it. my main reason for buying it was coconut oil pulling it has many benefits for oral healthcare and whitens teeth if you swish it around for 20 minutes don&#x27;t swallow and you spit it out it takes toxins out of your body</li>
    <li> I use this every morning right when I wake up and every night before going to sleep. Not only does my mouth feel refreshing, but my whole body feels healthy! Although it is a little on the pricey side, I highly recommend this brand!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. Does/helps with everything it says it does. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product that I ordered last spring.&lt;br /&gt;The container is smaller than previous ones and the oil is brown.</li>
    <li> Great as a moisturizer for face and body</li>
</ol>
