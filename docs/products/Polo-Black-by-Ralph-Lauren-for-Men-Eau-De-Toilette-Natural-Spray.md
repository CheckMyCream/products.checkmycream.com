      <li>Great deal and excellent packaging with this little number.</li>
      <li>This would be appropriate on a date</li>
      <li>but I figured it would be nice to have something to wear on special occasions.</li>
      <li>When he&#x27;s at work, the girls complements him about the nice odor,very unusual cent.</li>
      <li>Was upset since this isn&#x27;t a cheap cologne.</li>
      <li>Think of a smell after the barber shave with unique twist.</li>
      <li>I work with all these hot young nurses and they freakin love it!</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t particularly like it because it comes on strong musky smell that remains throughout the day.</li>

      <li>I am not really a cologne kind of guy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a deep dark tone and is great when some one asks what your wearing.</li>
      <li>Very rarely do people rate less than 5 stars for genuine cologne for its smell.</li>
      <li>Make sure you buy from a reputable seller (like Amazon proper) as it sounds like many people have been shipped fake stuff.</li>

      <li>cause my husband likes to try new scents often</li>
      <li>I have a genuine Polo Black</li>
      <li>This cologne was an early Christmas gift for my husband.  </li>
      <li>There are major problems with cologne reviews on amazon - there are people who buy cologne they like and give 5 stars, and there are the 1 star fakers.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my &#x27;signature smell&#x27; mixed with my fresh shower scents, hard to resist.</li>

<li> the smell is just like a plain alcohol and nothing like the original black.     </li>
<li> The smell is very dominant and hits the nose hard.</li>
<li> I think the polo black sent by amazon is either a duplicate or an expired one because being a vivid user of polo black when i applied this copy sent by amazon</li>
<li> Not worth sending it back</li>
<li> all the aroma of mango and other ingredients are just not there.</li>
<li> I have been using polo black for years now and travel a lot</li>
<li> this was NOT a true fragrance.</li>
<li> I am not sure it is even Black Polo!</li>
<li> I actually bought this blind based on reviews.</li>
<li> so I was looking for a small size bottle to travel with.</li>
<li> The smell of it is gonna be hard to describe, but when she smells this on me with my business casual clothing, it&#x27;s a wrap.</li>
<li> Guess shipping the correct order is too difficult these days.</li>

    <li> Sexy smell that last all day for any special men in your life.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, my son in law like it</li>
    <li> I think the polo black sent by amazon is either a duplicate or an expired one because being a vivid user of polo black when i applied this copy sent by amazon the smell is just like a plain alcohol and nothing like the original black.     all the aroma of mango and other ingredients are just not there. so watch it before you order from amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before but not at this price.  good price</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend&#x27;s 20th birthday. The shipping was fast, and he loved it! I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This has always been my go to. It&#x27;s got a deep dark tone and is great when some one asks what your wearing.</li>
    <li> There are major problems with cologne reviews on amazon - there are people who buy cologne they like and give 5 stars, and there are the 1 star fakers. Very rarely do people rate less than 5 stars for genuine cologne for its smell. I have a genuine Polo Black and I don&#x27;t particularly like it because it comes on strong musky smell that remains throughout the day. The smell is very dominant and hits the nose hard. Think of a smell after the barber shave with unique twist. This would be appropriate on a date if you want to annoy your date and make them pass out, otherwise stay away from this musky trash.</li>
    <li> I am not really a cologne kind of guy but I figured it would be nice to have something to wear on special occasions. I actually bought this blind based on reviews. It is definitely a great cologne. It doesn&#x27;t overpower the senses, but it does smell great. It may seem pricey but you get what you pay for. Make sure you buy from a reputable seller (like Amazon proper) as it sounds like many people have been shipped fake stuff.</li>
    <li> This cologne was an early Christmas gift for my husband.  He loves it and so do I!  lol  (&#x3D;  Smells great!</li>
    <li> Great deal and excellent packaging with this little number. It is the perfect size cause my husband likes to try new scents often so this size is perfect!!</li>
    <li> this was NOT a true fragrance.</li>
    <li> Awesome and quick service! Thank you! My son loved his birthday gift.</li>
    <li> I have been using polo black for years now and travel a lot so I was looking for a small size bottle to travel with. I found a 1.3 oz bottle on the website. When it arrived it was only a 1 oz bottle. Was upset since this isn&#x27;t a cheap cologne. Not worth sending it back so I guess I&#x27;m gonna eat the cost and suck it up. Guess shipping the correct order is too difficult these days.</li>
    <li> RL Black is the only cologne I own. It&#x27;s my &#x27;signature smell&#x27; mixed with my fresh shower scents, hard to resist. The smell of it is gonna be hard to describe, but when she smells this on me with my business casual clothing, it&#x27;s a wrap.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as one of the gifts for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday and he loves it.When he&#x27;s at work, the girls complements him about the nice odor,very unusual cent. I even hide and use it too when he&#x27;s away. buy it people!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so good it should come guaranteed to get you laid.  I work with all these hot young nurses and they freakin love it!</li>
    <li> This product is miss leading, it is nothing like the picture  I am not sure it is even Black Polo! Do not purchase</li>
    <li> Smell like you own the  Damn world! This is the perfect business and super dressy scent.</li>
