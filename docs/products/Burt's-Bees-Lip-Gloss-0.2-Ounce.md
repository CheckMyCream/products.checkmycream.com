### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m never gonna find the perfect lip gloss.</li>
      <li>awesome color and product</li>
      <li>Great color!</li>
      <li>This was perfect in the color category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It looked great on.</li>
      <li>The color&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t taste too great</li>
      <li>This is a great lip gloss in that effort.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost nude as the photo shows but also with a very nice shimmer.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, though, once I licked my lips just a bit, the gloss revived, and while it was depleted a bit, it wasn&#x27;t chalky anymore, nor did it become sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You do ingest a fair amount of whatever you coat your lips in</li>
      <li>Good for moisturizing, but not for color.</li>
      <li>Color is good.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the color of this gloss.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of agh about this lippy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky which is nice at this time of year when your hair gets blown in your face.</li>
      <li>The consistency was kind of pasty.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of torn on this one considering</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to see that they were expanding their lip gloss line to include these.</li>
      <li>The color is nice</li>
      <li>Nice packaging..</li>
      <li>I liked the result.</li>
      <li>It lasts long- great colors, consitancy perfect</li>
      <li>Bees makes very fine products.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I love this brand.</li>
      <li>I love lip gloss...</li>
      <li>I always think the next lip gloss will be the perfect lip gloss.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I love this product and I use it a lot.</li>
      <li>I know a lot of lip glosses are tacky but this one is more so than others.  </li>
      <li>I like most Burt&#x27;s Bees Products</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with how it looks once on the lips</li>
      <li>Darn, I thought, I should have thought that through better, now I&#x27;m going to have to lick the gloss off and reapply.  </li>
      <li>I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees brand</li>
      <li>/&gt;This has nice packaging and a nice color, but the problem is that it is very tacky.  </li>
      <li>This is a very light gloss-suitable for a young girl who&#x27;s just not into makeup, but needs a nice lip protection.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think the tube was filled to the capacity though once on the lips</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s light</li>
      <li>Nice shine, felt good and had a neutral color with a hint of pink shine.</li>
      <li>With just the right amount of sparkle, it made my lips look healthy and feel moisturized too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>But neither is it particularly rich feeling</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely shade of very creamy lip gloss...  </li>
      <li>Personally, I&#x27;m a Bonnie Bell kinda gal, but I saw this and thought it would be a nice &#x27;adult&#x27; alternative to my beloved Lip Smackers.</li>
      <li>old daughter tried some of this gloss, and soon after asked if she could have her own.  </li>
      <li>While I love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products, I just can&#x27;t really recommend this.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like super shiny, brightly colored glosses, as they feel meant for a younger woman.</li>
      <li>Ideal for the young teen.</li>
      <li>It quickly goes away, however.</li>
      <li>Love natural products!</li>
      <li>it if you want more of a natural 10 min staying lip gloss 😇</li>
      <li>I love naturally colored lip gloss, and this Burt&#x27;s Bees in Ocean Sunrise fits that description.  </li>
      <li>Goes on like more of a clear gloss</li>
      <li>right after I put some of the gloss on, I ate a bite of something, and noticed that the gloss immediately began feeling chalky.  </li>
      <li>The color was perfect for my skin tone and just dark enough that it looked like I had something on.</li>
      <li>This just may be my own &amp;#34;affliction&amp;#34; as my lips are always dry.</li>
      <li>The Burt&#x27;s Bees brand is always one I want to like, because I like the packaging, the nice colors and the cute sets, but when I get the items home I am usually not very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely order more soon.</li>
      <li>- pretty color</li>
      <li>There is also a yummy glazed donut scent when you first put it on.  </li>
      <li>I was scraping the edges of the bottle trying to get more and this was only after one usage or just opened....</li>
      <li>There are so many similarly priced makeup items that this just doesn&#x27;t stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this would be my first time trying the gloss.</li>
      <li>Pretty and functional.</li>
      <li>She feels pretty also and loves applying them.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d also adore their lip gloss, but I was really dissapointed</li>
      <li>so I expected the pigment to show up a bit better.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, it did absolutely nothing for my lips.</li>
      <li>and she says it doesn&#x27;t really make much difference.</li>
      <li>Thought there would be more of a pink color.  </li>
      <li>I kept dipping the tube yet not getting much</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem like much was in there.</li>
      <li>But if the one you get is anything like the one I got don&#x27;t expect to get much out of it.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon, for the opportunity to try this, but it really wasn&#x27;t to my liking.</li>
      <li>This is your basic lip gloss that gives you that nice simple finish.  </li>
      <li>Pretty even down to the packaging which has a fading honeycomb pattern on the top.  </li>
      <li>There is just a hint of color: a kind of a pale peach-pink hue.</li>
      <li>The color is lovely but given my other qualms this gloss seems pricey at almost twelve dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is on the sheer side, but it does have just enough opacity to tone down a lipcolor that feels too strong on its own.  </li>
      <li>but looks really natural &amp; pretty on.</li>
      <li>Also at about half the price of this lipgloss I think it&#x27;s a better deal.)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was just the one I received, the consistency of the product inside or something else, but if you&#x27;re going to pay 12 bucks for a lip gloss i&#x27;d expect there to be a decent amount there.</li>
      <li>Unlike every other lip balm that you have to apply every five minutes, it leaves your lips soft and refreshed, its fantastic!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kind of hard to get out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to try it in a much brighter shade since I do like the idea of a natural lip color.</li>
      <li>The gloss is much thicker than some I&#x27;ve used--perhaps because it is all natural.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The gloss definitely moisturizes, as well as being pretty, which I really appreciated.</li>
      <li>As it is, I am not inclined to choose this over some of the other trusted glosses I have found, depending on what is available when I am shopping.</li>
      <li>Nice and subtle lip gloss with just a hint of color and sparkle.  </li>
      <li>There is a subtle rose gold shimmer to the gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container and applicator are pretty standard.</li>
      <li>My 12 year old loves this lip gloss!</li>
      <li>I tried really hard to like this because I LOVE Burt&#x27;s Bees chapsticks.</li>
      <li>but as far as dipping the stick in the bottle</li>
      <li>Also, the bottle looked bigger in the picture then it really is.</li>
      <li>I am thankful for companies that offer products for young ladies who want to let their natural beauty shine through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She also likes a natural look.  </li>
      <li>The smell is very mild, not overwhelming</li>
      <li>Their pink grapefruit chapstick in still my favorite chapstick of all time, but this lip gloss is a huge fail.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not easy to slide on and remain moist enough to feel comfortable on my lips.</li>

    <li> Unlike every other lip balm that you have to apply every five minutes, it leaves your lips soft and refreshed, its fantastic! Doesn&#x27;t taste too great (but hey your not supposed to be eating it) And it smells like fruity pebbles!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s a really pretty color, but it&#x27;s awfully sticky and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Love natural products!</li>
    <li> Great color! Moisturizing.. Nice packaging.. Vermont company..</li>
    <li> - pretty color&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t stay on very long&lt;br /&gt;- bad smell&lt;br /&gt;- but looks really natural &amp; pretty on. ☺️&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy it if you want more of a natural 10 min staying lip gloss 😇😂</li>
    <li> Color is good.  Takes about four dips to achieve any sense of color.  Too dry and leaves my lips chapped and peeling.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I use it a lot. I like the colors but it is very thick. Also, the bottle looked bigger in the picture then it really is.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, it did absolutely nothing for my lips. I like my lip gloss to be a bit creamy or give me something but I felt that this was not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Since everything we put on our skin gets into our bloodstream and bodies, I&#x27;ve been working to minimize toxic loads. This is a great lip gloss in that effort.</li>
    <li> awesome color and product</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a tad lighter color.  I do prefer lip gloss over regular lipstick, but, this one has an odd tasted at first.  It quickly goes away, however.</li>
    <li> I tried really hard to like this because I LOVE Burt&#x27;s Bees chapsticks. I thought I&#x27;d also adore their lip gloss, but I was really dissapointed and I will be returning this to CVS where I purchased it from.  The smell is really unpleasant and it&#x27;s just too sticky. Their pink grapefruit chapstick in still my favorite chapstick of all time, but this lip gloss is a huge fail. I&#x27;m amazed they are from the same company.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old loves this lip gloss! She suffers with dry skin during our long winters and has tried every brand of chap-stick under the sun. She says she feels that wearing Burt&#x27;s Bess Lip Gloss feels like her chapped lips are repaired somewhat. The smell is very mild, not overwhelming and she says it doesn&#x27;t really make much difference. She feels pretty also and loves applying them. A winner in our book!</li>
    <li> I love naturally colored lip gloss, and this Burt&#x27;s Bees in Ocean Sunrise fits that description.  With just the right amount of sparkle, it made my lips look healthy and feel moisturized too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once right after I put some of the gloss on, I ate a bite of something, and noticed that the gloss immediately began feeling chalky.  Darn, I thought, I should have thought that through better, now I&#x27;m going to have to lick the gloss off and reapply.  Surprisingly, though, once I licked my lips just a bit, the gloss revived, and while it was depleted a bit, it wasn&#x27;t chalky anymore, nor did it become sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 13 yr. old daughter tried some of this gloss, and soon after asked if she could have her own.  She also likes a natural look.  I am thankful for companies that offer products for young ladies who want to let their natural beauty shine through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish Burt&#x27;s Bees had a bit  of a honey flavor or scent.  Silly, I know, but I always expect a little whiff or taste of honey when I see the honeycomb design on their products, only to be disappointed.  This would have made this product a must-have with a 5-star review for me.  As it is, I am not inclined to choose this over some of the other trusted glosses I have found, depending on what is available when I am shopping.</li>
    <li> I like most Burt&#x27;s Bees Products but this would be my first time trying the gloss. I&#x27;d say overall i&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product. I&#x27;m satisfied with how it looks once on the lips but as far as dipping the stick in the bottle it&#x27;s kind of hard to get out. It didn&#x27;t seem like much was in there. I don&#x27;t know if it was just the one I received, the consistency of the product inside or something else, but if you&#x27;re going to pay 12 bucks for a lip gloss i&#x27;d expect there to be a decent amount there. To me it didn&#x27;t seem like there was. The consistency was kind of pasty. I kept dipping the tube yet not getting much out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see me getting a lot out of this considering what is in the tube. It&#x27;s straining just to get the gloss on the wand to put it on your lips- I was scraping the edges of the bottle trying to get more and this was only after one usage or just opened.... I&#x27;m kind of torn on this one considering I didn&#x27;t think the tube was filled to the capacity though once on the lips I liked the result. It looked great on. Looks different on the lips than it does when trying to get it out of the tube. Nice shine, felt good and had a neutral color with a hint of pink shine. Overall, I&#x27;d probably give it 3.5- 4 stars. But if the one you get is anything like the one I got don&#x27;t expect to get much out of it.</li>
    <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees brand is always one I want to like, because I like the packaging, the nice colors and the cute sets, but when I get the items home I am usually not very satisfied.  This item lives up to that standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has nice packaging and a nice color, but the problem is that it is very tacky.  I know a lot of lip glosses are tacky but this one is more so than others.  It is unpleasant and I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again.  There are so many similarly priced makeup items that this just doesn&#x27;t stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars.</li>
    <li> Good for moisturizing, but not for color. I found that the holder gets sticky after using it for awhile, and I am very careful.</li>
    <li> It lasts long- great colors, consitancy perfect and you will receive compliments galore. Beats the expensive dept store brands anyday.</li>
    <li> I love lip gloss...I wear it every day. Personally, I&#x27;m a Bonnie Bell kinda gal, but I saw this and thought it would be a nice &#x27;adult&#x27; alternative to my beloved Lip Smackers. It&#x27;s not. Being that this is a Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s product, I was surprised to be so disappointed with this. I have a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees products that I really like, but this gloss is certainly not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very thick and heavy, but you need about 2-3 dips of the brush to really get your lips covered. The color is pretty much non-existent, which wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if it weren&#x27;t NINE DOLLARS a tube! I can get an 8-pack of lip gloss for that price at the drug-store. There is a slight shimmer to your lips after applying it, but no real color. Some people prefer this, so you may like that, but the texture is just too thick for my liking, and the price way too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up chucking this and going back to my regular lip gloss/chapstick favorites. Thanks Amazon, for the opportunity to try this, but it really wasn&#x27;t to my liking. While I love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products, I just can&#x27;t really recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of agh about this lippy. It&#x27;s not sticky which is nice at this time of year when your hair gets blown in your face. But neither is it particularly rich feeling and I feel like you get a small amount of product on the applicator with just one dip. The color is another issue. I know it&#x27;s light but I&#x27;m porcelain skinned so I expected the pigment to show up a bit better. I&#x27;d like to try it in a much brighter shade since I do like the idea of a natural lip color. You do ingest a fair amount of whatever you coat your lips in so I&#x27;d rather it not be all chemically.</li>
    <li> Ocean Sunrise lip gloss applies soothly and evenly.  The applicator is a small and angled sponge tip.  It goes on in a very sheer way. There is just a hint of color: a kind of a pale peach-pink hue. There is a subtle rose gold shimmer to the gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees makes very fine products. This is a very light gloss-suitable for a young girl who&#x27;s just not into makeup, but needs a nice lip protection. This fits that bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing negative to say. Nice and subtle lip gloss with just a hint of color and sparkle.  Ideal for the young teen.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lovely shade of very creamy lip gloss...  stays on for a long time..  I will definitely order more soon.</li>
    <li> My wife loves Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this lip gloss was no exception. That being said she did have a few complaints. For instance the lip gloss goes on very thin when using the applicator and the shiny look doesn&#x27;t last that long. Nevertheless, she still likes this lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Thought there would be more of a pink color.  Goes on like more of a clear gloss</li>
    <li> Pretty even down to the packaging which has a fading honeycomb pattern on the top.  The color is on the sheer side, but it does have just enough opacity to tone down a lipcolor that feels too strong on its own.  There is also a yummy glazed donut scent when you first put it on.  It&#x27;s not sticky at all and lasts about as long as other lip glosses.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is your basic lip gloss that gives you that nice simple finish.  I&#x27;ve become tired of heavy, dark lipsticks and enjoy a light, moisturizing gloss now.  The applicator only allows a slight amount of product to come out and be applied, which turns out to be just right.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the color of this gloss. It&#x27;s almost nude as the photo shows but also with a very nice shimmer. The effect in my lips is subtle which I prefer and I like the sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container and applicator are pretty standard. The gloss is much thicker than some I&#x27;ve used--perhaps because it is all natural. Also for just a second I got the scent of the gloss (a waxy smell) while I applied it. The scent diminished after. Because it is thick it does take a couple of coats to get an even coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on my lips but the waxy smell whenever I purse my lips and the thick texture are a turn off. The color is lovely but given my other qualms this gloss seems pricey at almost twelve dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I also just bought Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balm. It&#x27;s essentially colored Chapstick and the texture and color are a lot better--darker and smoother but without a shimmer. Also at about half the price of this lipgloss I think it&#x27;s a better deal.)</li>
    <li> I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees brand I was thrilled to see that they were expanding their lip gloss line to include these. The color was perfect for my skin tone and just dark enough that it looked like I had something on. I don&#x27;t like super shiny, brightly colored glosses, as they feel meant for a younger woman. This was perfect in the color category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloss definitely moisturizes, as well as being pretty, which I really appreciated. That&#x27;s why I love this brand. Pretty and functional. The price is a little steep for a gloss, but I like it enough (and respect the brand enough) to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two complaints are the amount of gloss that comes out on the stick and how long the gloss lasts. It takes four or five dips into the gloss to get a sufficient amount to come out, whereas it should only take one or two. And after about 15 minutes, I&#x27;m wanting to reapply.</li>
    <li> I must have a million lip glosses. I always think the next lip gloss will be the perfect lip gloss. It will shine, won&#x27;t be too sticky and it will last. I&#x27;m never gonna find the perfect lip gloss. But in the words of Meatloaf, Two Out of Three Ain&#x27;t Bad. The only thing not perfect about this lip gloss is the sticky factor. For me, it&#x27;s too sticky. The color&#x27;s great, it has some shine and it lasts well into the day.</li>
    <li> The color is nice but it&#x27;s not easy to slide on and remain moist enough to feel comfortable on my lips. This just may be my own &amp;#34;affliction&amp;#34; as my lips are always dry.</li>
