      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for spring an summer an it super light!</li>
      <li>I bought the candy coral color, and it&#x27;s a nice neutral color.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pigmented and feels great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sort of a gooey textured kind of powder thing.</li>
      <li>Nice product though.</li>

      <li>but with warm undertones</li>
      <li>This is good stuff and goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>I find that it&#x27;s best applied using directly on the skin and then blending out with the fingers.</li>

      <li>I have these on subscription, need I say more?</li>
      <li>I love the color</li>
      <li>I sure might need to buy more of these…</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better to get it from Walgreen or CVS</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This is more of a light warm coral color, and because of it&#x27;s texture you can apply it heavily or lightly.  </li>
      <li>Soft, creamy great product for not wanting to accentuate wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Applies easily with a brush and blends into surrounding makeup.</li>
      <li>Nice color (not weird).</li>
      <li>I got this for more summery looks because it&#x27;s starting to get warm here.</li>
      <li>Im pretty light</li>
      <li>The color is pretty, but for me it does not go on smoothly.</li>
      <li>This product has a fluffy playdoh like texture with great color payoff.</li>
      <li>i love color the pigmentation and how soft it is</li>
      <li>I use my Elf flat top powder blush to apply it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Pink Lift blush, but I like Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Bouncy blush a bit better, because it takes less product to give good coverage, and the price is better for the amount of product you get.</li>
      <li>My first creamy blush , i through ti made a mistake buying it</li>
      <li>It is very flattering for my skin color.  </li>
      <li>a fresh, completely natural-looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
      <li>I tried it when it arrived, and I don&#x27;t really think I&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The small, light case is easy to carry in a purse, and I had no questions getting through airport security with it because it&#x27;s not a liquid or</li>
      <li>A little pinker than described, I was thinking it would be more coral.  </li>
      <li>This is a product that really gives a natural color.  </li>
      <li>When you first open the package the blush itself is in a dome shape that can be pushed down and it bounces back up, I wasn&#x27;t sure how to apply this at first</li>
      <li>When you first open the package the blush itself is in a dome shape that can be pushed down and it bounces back up, I wasn&#x27;t sure how to apply this at first</li>
      <li>I know that this blush didn&#x27;t just come out or anything, but it was a new concept to me.</li>
      <li>It gives a natural look.</li>
      <li>Soft and creamy, it goes on my skin like butter, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or pasty, and gave my cheeks</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this will last me past the expiration date.</li>
      <li>i like a more natural look and because your pores become more saturated with color than the rest of your skin, it really looks fake and ridiculous.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly what I wanted and expected the color to be.</li>
      <li>I like this color especially as it looks like a natural blush.</li>
      <li>it screams to the world not only that you&#x27;re wearing makeup, but a really poor quality very cheap clown variety.  </li>
      <li>The huge problem I have is that there&#x27;s not good way to apply it.  </li>
      <li>this product spreads weird (i used my fingers) and the pigment settles into your pores so you end up with tiny bright pink or coral dots all over your cheeks.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is super cute but the blush feels spongy and weird!!</li>
      <li>Sometimes I add a little to my lips and the very tip of my nose, too.</li>

<li> It blends well and looks natural, if you don&#x27;t go heavy on the application.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure it lasts very long, definitely not as long as stain but definitely as long as a powder.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s pink with a hint of orange (the coral one).</li>

<li> I haven&#x27;t used it past the one time</li>
<li> I use a very small amount because it works so well.</li>
<li> This product isn&#x27;t a powder, so application was weird for me.</li>
<li> so it looked mediocre.</li>
<li> It stuck to the cap and when I opened the product a chunk of the blush had broken off from the base.</li>
<li> Disappointed!</li>

    <li> This is good stuff and goes on smooth.  It blends well and looks natural, if you don&#x27;t go heavy on the application.  A little goes a long way in blending into a foundation.</li>
    <li> I would buy it, again and again. It gives a natural look.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like brand new, old package, inside there some dirty spots. Disappointed! Wanna return! It&#x27;s better to get it from Walgreen or CVS</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small 0.19 oz was... but it&#x27;s still really great. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I swatched it and the texture is really good. It&#x27;s powdery on the brush and creamy on skin. The color is also really great. I got this for more summery looks because it&#x27;s starting to get warm here. It&#x27;s pink with a hint of orange (the coral one). It is exactly what I wanted and expected the color to be.</li>
    <li> The consistency of this blush is closer to a cream blush, but not as greasy. When you first open the package the blush itself is in a dome shape that can be pushed down and it bounces back up, I wasn&#x27;t sure how to apply this at first but I&#x27;ve just been using my fingers to do the job.</li>

    <li> The texture of this product is horrendous it does not apply well but the color is nice for my brown skin tone.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
    <li> A little pinker than described, I was thinking it would be more coral.  Still a great texture and color though.</li>
    <li> I love the color but I find that the color doesn&#x27;t look that great on my skin. Just makes me look red faced instead of blushing. Nice product though. I think this would look great on someone who is VERY fair... Im pretty light but with warm undertones so it looked mediocre.</li>
    <li> I love Maybelline, and this color looks great on my skin.  I have pale ivory skin with some freckles, with a pink under tone. Just a little bit goes a long way.  I&#x27;m sure this will last me past the expiration date.</li>

    <li> Eh. That&#x27;s the best review I can give. This product isn&#x27;t a powder, so application was weird for me. It&#x27;s sort of a gooey textured kind of powder thing. I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it. I haven&#x27;t used it past the one time I tried it when it arrived, and I don&#x27;t really think I&#x27;ll use it again. I&#x27;m more of a powder person anyway.</li>
    <li> They discontinue it! Perfect texture, goes on smoothly and blends well.  I like this color especially as it looks like a natural blush.</li>
    <li> Love it, beautiful color.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin, but there is already a lot of pink/red in my coloring so pinks and reds do nothing for me.  This is more of a light warm coral color, and because of it&#x27;s texture you can apply it heavily or lightly.  It is very flattering for my skin color.  Sometimes I add a little to my lips and the very tip of my nose, too.</li>
    <li> I either didn&#x27;t see that this was a cream to powder or it didn&#x27;t say it was. The color is pretty, but for me it does not go on smoothly. It will cake in one place, and not in others. I would send it back, but do not want to pay for return shipping.</li>
    <li> this product spreads weird (i used my fingers) and the pigment settles into your pores so you end up with tiny bright pink or coral dots all over your cheeks.  embarrassing.  i like a more natural look and because your pores become more saturated with color than the rest of your skin, it really looks fake and ridiculous.  it screams to the world not only that you&#x27;re wearing makeup, but a really poor quality very cheap clown variety.  save your $ and skip this one.</li>
    <li> The blush give great pigment.  I&#x27;m not sure it lasts very long, definitely not as long as stain but definitely as long as a powder.  A little bit of this goes a long way.  I bought the candy coral color, and it&#x27;s a nice neutral color.  The huge problem I have is that there&#x27;s not good way to apply it.  You definitely can&#x27;t use a brush.  I&#x27;ve been using a wedge sponge to blend it in but it takes a lot of work to get rid of the streaks.  The sponge has also worked great with all kinds of foundations and stains, I suppose maybe using your fingers would be the best option.</li>
    <li> This product has a fluffy playdoh like texture with great color payoff. I find that it&#x27;s best applied using directly on the skin and then blending out with the fingers.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this blush. The packaging is super cute but the blush feels spongy and weird!!</li>
    <li> I use Maybelline blushes daily and buy it at Amazons or Ebay because this product is discontinued. In my opinion is the best blush.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a tiny bit smaller than the Maybelline dream mousse blush. It is in a lighter plastic container while the other is in a glass container. No difference in the quality.</li>
    <li> This blush is absolutely amazing! I read review that the blush is very sheer and doesn&#x27;t stay long... Not with this one! I am 15 and I love the texture of this blush! I apply it in the morning and by the en of te day it&#x27;s stil there and visible! (I am in track and. Touch my fce a lot at school) It&#x27;s really pigmented and feels great! I use my Elf flat top powder blush to apply it! I totally recommend it! It&#x27;s perfect for spring an summer an it super light! Great product!</li>
    <li> I know that this blush didn&#x27;t just come out or anything, but it was a new concept to me. The consistency of this blush is closer to a cream blush, but not as greasy. When you first open the package the blush itself is in a dome shape that can be pushed down and it bounces back up, I wasn&#x27;t sure how to apply this at first but I&#x27;ve just been using my fingers to do the job. This color is great, not too much pigment but can be build able and is great for spring!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use a very small amount because it works so well. Soft, creamy great product for not wanting to accentuate wrinkles.</li>
