<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for frizz &amp; curls. Shake it well, and don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
    <li> Very good for ladies with curly hair that frizzes a lot. Makes hair smooth and smells good. I only buy it online because it is very expensive in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Another favorite is the Moroccan Oil BUT that is more expensive for less product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Biosilk Serum. I have very fine hair which tends to get damaged by blow drying fairly easily. As long as I&#x27;ve used this product, my hair is soft and shiny. Forget the expensive shampoos and use this instead. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you only need a small amount before blow drying and it protects your hair wonderfully and the bottle last forever. I&#x27;ve even gone through stages of flat ironing my hair and it still protected me from any damage. I just can&#x27;t recommend this product enough!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair very smooth following flat ironing.  Has a silky feel when used!  Cuts down on &amp;#34;fly-aways&amp;#34;.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have always loved BioSilk, and the price was CHEAP compared to what I was buying for a smaller bottle at Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a miracle oil in a beautifully shaped bottle, I had to order another one for my mother b/c it tamed our thick frizzy hair. Someone gifted me a small 2 ounce bottle and I treasured every drop. Now I found a bigger 12 ounce and I&#x27;m thrilled. Highly recommend this product for thick hair and to use with flat iron.</li>
    <li> Have used the product for several years and have been very happy with it.  Purchasing Bio-Silk from the Amazon sellers allows me to receive the product at my home for less money than purchasing from any local retailer.</li>
    <li> I used this a few years ago, and have tried other more expensive salon products since then. BioSilk is by far the best. Although it&#x27;s a serum based product, it has never weighed my hair down. Love it!</li>
    <li> Thanks for sending the wrong item with a much lower value.. I was in a hurry to leave the country after resewing it so i had no chance to return it ! Thanks for a great costumer survive</li>
    <li> Great hair product.  Leaves hair super silky and smooth.  Helps tame fly-aways.</li>
    <li> High quality and genuine. much lower price than offered by Costco</li>
    <li> Excellent price for large size</li>
    <li> ive tryd many many other products for my hair and nothing is as good as biosilk. if only it was a little cheaper in stores it would get a perfect 5 star...other than that found this on amazon for a lot cheaper than the store cost. very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Product as advertized. I had used it previously and was just looking for a good price.  This product does not produce miracles, but it helps to make hair somewhat more manageable. keeping it down in damp weather.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Excellent product</li>
    <li> I just love this product. Leaves my hair feeling &amp; smelling good. I use it on pressed or natural curls.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It smells wonderful and makes your hair feel and look great. I was worried it would make my hair greasy but it doesn&#x27;t at all. I&#x27;ve been telling all my friends and family about this stuff, it&#x27;s that great!</li>
    <li> I have used BioSilk for years.  I purchased this several months ago and just opened it up.  It is not nearly the same quality.  It is watery.  It does not have the same consistency as all the others that I have used.  It smells of alcohol.  I will go buy a small bottle locally to see if the formula has changed or if this one is a diluted version / fake.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years  - It  is so much  better than  it&#x27;s competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is it is the price but well worth it</li>
    <li> My ends are damage and frayed from perms and color treatments. I used a quarter-sized drop of Biosilk for my long hair and it does improve the fel and look of my hair. Two quarter-sized drops and I&#x27;m golden!</li>
    <li> I loventhus product. Its good if you have freezy hair. I used it for almost 5 yrs now. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this when I was 14. Now I am 25 years old. This product literally saves me a lot of hair problems. I have a combination of dry, wavy, thick, coarse hair. I have a lot of frizzes and when I blow-dry, it&#x27;s bad. This has protected my hair from the damage I could&#x27;ve done to it whether it&#x27;s blow drying or hair straightening. I&#x27;ve tested it with and without the product. The difference is phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has the ingredients my hair needs. It turns my dry hair to a smooth and healthy looking one. It also smells really nice. Even though hair straightening is a culprit to damaging hair, this helps protect. I use this before I straighten. I have used it without and the results of my straightened hair is not as smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I highly recommend it, with or without straightening. It&#x27;s good to protect your hair even from a blow dry.</li>
    <li> This is a HUGE bottle!!  Great price for the size.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I use this not only on my hair but also my girls hair.  It really helps when you use heat on your hair.    This is a must have if you blow dry or use any type of heat on your hair.</li>
    <li> Such a good price for the size of the bottle. It smells the best!</li>
    <li> Great quality continues!</li>
    <li> Great product. Really makes my hair nice, smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Gives hair a great shine for days</li>
    <li> A hair stylist asked my one day what in the world I put on my hair as I walked in the room (I have very curly hair and have to flat iron it) and I use a lot of this product and it is just fantastic! She said my hair looked like silk and what was I putting on it? I said I don&#x27;t know that I would go and look. I laughed when I came back with the bottle I told her that she had it half right, it is BIOSILK therapy! It helps to smooth my hair (I have long hair to my waist, and very hard to control) and it also makes it very shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> My fav product for my hair</li>
    <li> I was giddy when I paid a low price for this product.  It leaves my hair really greasy!  I&#x27;ve been using *real* Biosilk Therapy for years and this is NOT the real deal!  So I&#x27;ll repeat, it is not the real product!</li>
    <li> I really think that it does the best straightening job&lt;br /&gt;than that of most products...without the heavy&lt;br /&gt;gloss build up on the hair like most other ones...</li>
    <li> I LOVE you my Biosilk!!</li>
    <li> I put this on damp hair after a shower and makes my hair very smooth.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair oil ever!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.  My hair is VERY VERY DRY.  A little goes a long way.  IT&#x27;S LIGHT, makes your hair feel awesome and is smells terrific.</li>
    <li> I use this product every time I wash my hair &amp; have for many years. I have trouble finding it now, so I have had to take to buying it on Amazon. I have extremely dry hair &amp; this product helps. It also</li>
    <li> great product. makes hair smooth and healthy looking. only need a little for it to be effective. a smaller bottle probably would have been enough for a while too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I love it! Great for hair and skin, leaves you smelling amazing!  This size will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Best price found on the net. Bought it as a gift for my mom and was happy with the product!</li>
    <li> love this brand. good product</li>
    <li> good way to buy this product. i use it all the time and it&#x27;s nice to not run out.GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years to fix my split ends. Highly recommend using this product if you use hot irons for styling your hair.</li>
    <li> With naturally wavy hair, I have always struggled with smoothing and taming my hair. With very long hair, the finished product always left me with a tee-pee/cone shaped outline. I resorted to wearing a ponytail anytime I was in public.&lt;br /&gt;Since adding this Biosilk to my routine (just this, not the full line), my hair is smooth, manageable, healthier AND stronger. I was 100% blown away!&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo, Condition, hand-wring, biosilk, and dry/style. Voila!&lt;br /&gt;And just fyi, the Chi silk product suggested/sold with their styling products is re-labeled Biosilk. They even credit Farouk (in very small print). ;)</li>
    <li> A bit greasy but after you &amp;#34;mess up&amp;#34; the first time, you know not to put on so much on your hair. Plus, the price on Amazon beats every price anywhere/everywhere!</li>
    <li> great price showed up fast.</li>
    <li> I bought BioSilk to try to tame my wavy, frizzy hair and it does a fantastic job! A little goes a long way, it takes care of my frizz issues and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling all crunchy.  And it is silky smooth! Love it.</li>
    <li> i love this product!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;my hair is smooth and shiny~~~&lt;br /&gt;i will use it again in the future :)&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
    <li> This stuff is what dreams are made of....</li>
    <li> Not what I thought I was buying. I thought I was buying silk therapy, not the conditioner. The bottles look alike and the wording on the add wasn&#x27;t real clear.  The product was ok.</li>
    <li> Best hair oil out there. I have been using this oil forever and it&#x27;s awesome. Much cheaper then the drug store but still pricey but worth the price. It sooths and smoothes your hair after a nice blow dry or flat iron. Also it smells amazing!! Would so recommend!</li>
    <li> The product wasn&#x27;t properly sealed. The little plastic seal under the cap was not adhered to the bottle. That said, the product seems okay and not diluted like some other hair products on amazon.</li>
    <li> COULD NOT FIND PRODUCT IN STORES - PRICE WAS RIGHT- QUALITY ALWAYS CONSISTENT- LOVE THE 12 OZ SIZE NO SUBSTITUTE COULD MATCH</li>
    <li> I lije this product i Belén using for long time my hair is very curry so this helas with the frizz</li>
    <li> I love this product! Leaves my hair shiny &amp; smelling beautiful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my hair cut before, and the lady at the salon I went to would put a pea drop in her hand, rub her hands together, and run it through my hair. It adds shine and definition to any layers in your hair. It&#x27;s not heavy and smells nice. When I saw it for sale on Amazon, I just had to buy it. The price at the salon was too expensive. The price listed on Amazon was worth it and it is a much bigger size.</li>
    <li> I just got this from the mail and this product feels like it&#x27;s nice from the amount of the product I felt on my hands while taking the bottle out of the bag as there was no additional packaging inside and a lot of the product came out as the lid was not screwed on properly. I was really surprised when I saw that there was no additional packaging inside but I was like whatever, but then I took the bottle out and there was oil dripping down the bottle and my hand was covered with it. I realized the lid was not screwed on properly and about an inch of the product leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the product feels nice, I would&#x27;ve been a lot happier with my purchase if the shipment was packaged more securely.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be not only for hair but is wonderful on my dry skin.  I even use a little of it under a moisturizer on my face.  It seems to help my foundation go on more smoothly..</li>
    <li> I have thick, uncontrollable, wavy hair. I use a defuse every morning to make my ringlets even more defined; however,  mousse and gel left my hair unmanageable,  sticky and wild! I looked like a mess! I loved the sample of Sunglitz Repair and Shine I received from my hairstylist friend but since it is not the same formula any longer, I found that Bio Silk was almost exact!!  And it is the best! This is just what I need each morning, it&#x27;s controls the frizz, keeps it flexible and soft, and it doesn&#x27;t weight down my mane! And bonus: it doesn&#x27;t smell terrible. The scent is light and unnoticeable. I never thought I&#x27;d find one hair product to meet all needs like Sunglitz and BioSilk!</li>
    <li> I actually made a mistake when I order this product, thinking that I was ordering the silk therapy, not the conditioner.  However, I do like the conditioner. It softens my hair and does a good job of conditioning it.</li>
    <li> This product is really good, as it leaves your hair soft without being oily. I recommend it to those who have long hair and want to  detangle their hair in a minute.</li>
    <li> damn good, amazing, you can witness the magic after using!</li>
    <li> Bio silk smells good and makes your hair soft, silky and shiny without weighing it down. It doesn&#x27;t take very much either. I use about a dime sized drop for thick hair almost half way down my back and it the bottle will last a while. You can use it on your skin too. After pricing at the grocery store and salons, Amazon had the best price.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing at keeping moisture in my hair. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 20 years and it has never let me down.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product for my hair. I also use this under my makeup for a smooth and moisture application. This is an excellent price and shipping price was fabulous.</li>
    <li> When the BioSilk Silk Therapy came in the mail it smelled completely of rubbing alcohol with a hint the product smell. I&#x27;ve never used it. I went back and started buying it at the stores. I think it was a used bottle and I ordered new.</li>
    <li> I really like this product a lot. It was recommended to me by my hairdresser and she was right, it is indeed a great product. It leaves your hair silky and well behaved under humidity. My hair is super freezy and tends to shrink under humidity but this product helps me to control all that.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both share this product for our naturally curly hair.  It&#x27;s light weight so it doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down.  You only need a pea size amount.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I looked for</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this once a week for the last couple of weeks and i have to say that so far my hair is getting softer (especially the ends where i&#x27;ve had some split end issues, as well as feeling fuller and thicker! In my opinion, so far so good! I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> Product has gotten much thinner since last time I bought it. &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; I suspect so you get less product for the money and yet it costs more. But.... still does good job on my hair so will continue to buy it ...just need to use more of it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years now and can&#x27;t see myself using any other product, it smells really good and you only need just a pea size. This bottle has lasted me over a year and the price is great!</li>
    <li> I found Biosilk Silk Therapy when I visited a Beauty Care store but was knocked out by the price. They charge $24.99 for a 5.5 oz bottle. I looked at Amazon&#x27;s prices and since it works so well to control my frizz I bought a 12 oz bottle for less than what the beauty shop was selling 5.5 oz for!    Great deal and great product! I will be buying my Biosilk through Amazon from now on!</li>
    <li> Makes my severely damaged hair much smoother!</li>
    <li> Great product for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I love Biosilk. I have tried  moroccan oil and other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products, but it doesn&#x27;t hold up as well with the other products I use in my hair.  I was so glad to find it at almost half the price.</li>
    <li> Always love Biosilk therapy.  We use it mainly while blow drying the hair to combat the frizzies.  Love this for the hair.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> Me and my husband love this for our air. Great price.</li>
    <li> expire date is already passed 1 and half year. It is just like water. awful!&lt;br /&gt;this is worst order ever</li>
    <li> Good product-makes hair shine</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff.  I use a little bit on the ends of my hair every morning when I get out of the shower.  It works as a detangler, enhances my natural curl, and leaves my hair feeling soooo soft without looking greasy and flat.  A little goes a long way, so one bottle lasts for months, maybe even a year.</li>
    <li> More than worth the price I paid for it &#x3D; $15 for 12 ounces, i had paid $24 for the 5 ounces at my local store, when i saw this i couldn&#x27;t believe the price.  Will definitely be sending the link to my friends.</li>
    <li> GREAT BUY! I LOVE BIOSILK! It helps my hair not be so frizzy and brings out my shine to my hair! It smells great and i can&#x27;t live without it! Amazon sells this decent size that last me like a year while wal-mart sells them smaller for the same price or more! A small portion goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over 5 years and have turned on all my cousins in London. I know have to buy it from here and bring it over to them on a yearly basis! When I am using this product regularly not a day goes by that I don&#x27;t get a comment on the shine in my hair. It is also super silky and soft to the touch. My boyfriend can&#x27;t stop running his fingers through my hair and I love it! This is also a wonderful protector for those of you who use blow dryers or straighteners. I don&#x27;t blow dry, I dry naturally because I have super fine hair but I do tend to flat iron some times. I only apply to the tips though and never really to the scalp so the bottle lasts me forever. I am Asian Indian so my hair is naturally oily so there is no need to add it to the scalp. You will love this product and Amazon has it for the best price! I was so sad when Sam&#x27;s club stopped selling the Shampoo/Conditional/Silk Therapy combo pack but thank god for Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> Great price for this much product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price</li>
    <li> Good value for the money</li>
    <li> BioSilk Therapy is an excellent product that can be used with any type of hair texture.&lt;br /&gt;Has a very pleasant fragrance when placed in hair.&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, it does not weigh the hair down whe used.&lt;br /&gt;Good to use when hair is dry and needs a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My salon uses it in my hair when wet and before styling.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product - recommend it very highly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! Worth my money.</li>
    <li> So I bought the wrong product, mixed up the name. It turned out in my favor. First off, this is HUGE, I mean OVER A YEARS SUPPLY, and this price is not too shabby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some reviews where it states if you use too much it makes your hair greasy... WELL DUH. It&#x27;s a moisturizer. It&#x27;s a very good protector as well, it&#x27;s to prevent burning your hair. Honestly, you don&#x27;t need a lot, just a SMALL, small dab on your finger. That&#x27;s it, seriously, that&#x27;s why this large bottle can last well over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That one small dab you evenly distribute on all four of your fingers on both sides, then run your fingers through your hair, until satisfied. If you don&#x27;t feel like you didn&#x27;t use a sufficient amount, then add a little more. SERIOUSLY, don&#x27;t overdue it. This is good stuff, you only need a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I love, is how it smells, and it lingers in your hair till you wash it out. It&#x27;s not overpowering, but you get occasional wafts of it throughout the day, and it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
    <li> Great product as normal; the ends of my hair drink it right up and keeps my hair from getting too dry.</li>
    <li> It was for my mom as a gift. She was happy to have one.</li>
    <li> I have tons of hair, very thick not really curly but with waves.  I use this before blow drying and before using the flat iron and  leaves it silky and straight.  It&#x27;s actually great as a body cream as well.  It smells delicious.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two years and it never disappoints.  I also have done the keratin on my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is always the best choice for my hair.  It is so light and gives my hair a lustrous look.</li>
    <li> Tried lots of products.  This is the best one for keeping natural curl/wave without weighing down hair, or making it stiff.</li>
    <li> I could give you the whole spiel on how this is my first choice hair oil and the first I ever used when I was young, but in stead I&#x27;ll just tell you what you&#x27;re here to know. The biosilk arrived in perfect condition. The seal was slightly opened, so the outside was the tiniest bit greasy, but nothing to complain about. I received my package (along with 2 other items) within 2 days. This stuff is the real deal and at an AMAZING price. The 12oz will last me months if not a year or more (and I have long hair and use it often). Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to buy a leave in hair treatment for hair health</li>
    <li> Have used for years,great product, lasts forever (this 12 oz. bottle lasted me 3 years the last time!) a little bit goes a long way. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years . It is the best product for my wild hair. It really tames it!</li>
    <li> I THINK THIS IS A FAKE PRODUCT, IT IS VERY WATERERY DOSE NOT SMELL THE SAME AS THE ONE I BOUGHT IN THE BEAUTY SUPPLY .</li>
    <li> In a lot of salons I&#x27;ve seen the 5.8oz for around $25, so this was an amazing deal. Great quality, but the price is incredible here.</li>
    <li> Time honored hair silkner and protectant, works wonderfully when applied to wet hair for a smooth shinny result with no added weight or oily feel. Great for long hair and in dry weather conditions. I  have found that if Bio Silk is applied to dry hair it can feel somewhat gooey, offers little shine and has a completely different result than when applied to clean wet hair prior to blow drying.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a must for my long hair, which is often prone to tangling because of its length.  I put a little on my damp towel-dried hair, and it helps me get the comb through my hair!  And it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.  The scent is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Product was +90% water!!!</li>
    <li> Im very happy I it this at a very good price, Thank  u</li>
    <li> Great product and so much cheaper on Amazon.com!  I have been buying this products for years and it is wonderful on keeping the body in my hair.</li>
    <li> this work great, and smell so good</li>
    <li> I have been using Biosilk for the last 15 years and it has been a Godsend! I am in awe that I got a salon-quality product for a fraction of the salon-quality price! I do remember that the formula was thicker when I first started using Biosilk a a teen. However, I also noticed that my Mom&#x27;s bottle that she has had for the last 3 years has gotten thicker &amp; separated over time--but nothing that a quick shake wouldn&#x27;t fix. She has since switched her Biosilk out for Argan Oil as she wanted something more &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash &amp; blow dry my hair 2xs a day and flat iron 1x a day. I also dye my hair pretty often. Biosilk helps prevent my hair from becoming damaged with all the hell I put it through. Even other hair oils (brazillian nut, argon, weleda) have not been as good to me as biosilk! Buy a small bottle if you just want a trial size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I love it, I use it, I cannot live without it.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shine.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Fair price, quick shipping.</li>
    <li> This product is just great.  Leaves even really dry hair soft and shiny without a greasy look at all.  The scent is beautiful too, gentle and fresh.  The product is not cheap but if you can afford it, at least indulge yourself and give it a try.</li>
    <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> it was for wife and she like it very much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and each time I run out of it, I think about trying something less expensive, but end up regretting it, and reorder Biosilk.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I really love it. It is silky smooth and leaves your skin feeling wonderful.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this negative stars ... DON&#x27;T BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. This is NOT BIOSILK !!! I opened it all excited, but it smells just like nail polish remover... it looks as liquidy as water too. So i put a little bit in my hands &amp; IT WOULDNT COME OFF! I had to scrub &amp; scrub &amp; scrub with so much soap to get it off my hands . I wouldn&#x27;t DARE put this in my hair . I contacted the company saying I wanted a refund for this FAKE product, but they refuse! They said since I opened it &amp; used it, they cannot refund me or send me a label to send it back. This is ridiculous. How would I know its a fake product if I didn&#x27;t open it? Idiots . This company is horrible.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use for your hair, just put a few drops in your hands and rub them together and run your fingers through your hair and you will see how much softer your hair is and much shinner too.  You can use some on your face as well. I also want to add that I went to some Salon&#x27;s to find this product and for this size bottle they wanted $42.00 and $35.00 for the 5.64 oz. size.  You can&#x27;t beat the price and the shipping is free.  Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> My daughters hair feels like silk with this product, it is very high priced.</li>
    <li> I believe mine&#x27;s probably a few years old... or it had been left in the heat because there was a gross yellow layer at the top that keeps coming back no matter how many times I shake it. That and it breaks me out where my hair touches the side of my face. I have used this product many times before and this has never happened. I already broke the seal ( which came off with the slightest touch-- makes me think it had been tampered with or the glue used on it was ancient) so I couldn&#x27;t return it. Oh well. I&#x27;m just not going to buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have normal to dry hair.  I use this on the days that I wash my hair and on the days I use my straightener.  It helps keep the heat from damaging the hair.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy unless you use alot of it.  Most times just a dime size works, but I have real thick long hair and it takes more than that. Even my grandkids (boy and girl) and have started using it because it helps with their frizzies.  If you put very much on and then use a curling iron or straightener it will smoke alittle. But it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair or iron.  There isn&#x27;t much smell to it.  Very large bottle and it will last me more than a year, maybe close to 2 yrs. I don&#x27;t think it has an expiration date either.  I will look and update if it does.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product since it was introduced to us by my sister-in-law, who lives in Canada. Since then I had order the product from Amazon. The Biosilk  Therapy is great on your hair and skin. You do not need to use a lot and it last long.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. My stylist introduced me to it about 10 years ago. It smells divine, and leaves my hair silky smooth and ready for any other products I may want to use. I use this product after every hair wash. Love it!</li>
    <li> NOT REAL BIOSILK (I should have listened to the other users&#x27; ratings).  The bottle says &amp;#34;Biosilk,&amp;#34; but the contents are very watery and smell like rubbing alcohol.  I will NOT be putting this awful smelling product on my hair.  I was going to return the package, but since I opened it, I cannot do so.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY--PAY MORE FOR THE REAL PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Excellent price! Fast delivery. Great transaction. Thank you</li>
    <li> I use silk therapy every time I wash my hair and love the way it feels. My hair is butt-length, healthy and shiny, and I definitely think the silk therapy helps keep it that way.</li>
    <li> Received this item and noticed the seal was not intact. Notified Amazon which reimbursed me with no hesitation. Was very disappointed with &amp;#34;deals for beauty&amp;#34; supplier which assured me that the item was genuine and that it was because the seal may have come in contact with the serum that may have caused it to not stick on properly. I beg to differ. I used the product and found that it seems to be very different from what I have purchased before. The serum was found to be watery and I had to apply it into my hair at least 3 times. From what I have purchase before from other suppliers I would only need a quarter size in the palm of my hand and I still had to wash it off after. This serum seems like it was diluted in some way so make sure the seal is intact.  I was disappointed in the suppliers response and would not purchase from &amp;#34;deals for beauty&amp;#34; again.</li>
    <li> Biosilk is one the best products I&#x27;ve come across which puts some shine back into your hair and makes it smooth and manageable. I&#x27;d recommend as just a squirt does your entire scalp: this bottle will last me forever xD</li>
    <li> Some of the other reviews said this smells bad- couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth. I think it has a lovely scent. I apply it to my wet hair and then dry with the dryer so it soaks in and makes my hair very soft. You only need about a dime size, you don&#x27;t need much. A bottle has lasted me about a year.  I really notice if I forget to use</li>
    <li> I like this a lot but it is really messy. It smells amazing and its not heavy at all. I would recommend it and buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional and leaves my hair fantastic. Great price through amazon. Does not leave my hair oily.</li>
    <li> I love this product as it makes my hair so soft... it is a good deal for the 12 ozs.</li>
    <li> Every year my daughter asks for this item for Christmas. She loves it and has recommended it to a lot of her friends. It does everything that it says it will do and then some, Makes your hair soft and very silky...</li>
    <li> I have used BioSilk Silk Therapy for quite a while now.  I do not use conditioner.  I towel dry my hair after showering and add a couple of teaspoons to my hair.  It smells really great, do not leave my hair oily, and leaves my hair really soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using biosilk for 3 years since I&#x27;ve been straightening it. It really helps keep my hair silky and smelling great! My kids often walk up to me and ask to smell my hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> have had curly thick wiry hair my whole life...tried every product under the sun ...biosilk right after shower followed by this other stuff I buy in drug store its a natural gel ...works great!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great price!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I ordered it at a great price and they shipped as promised. I am satisfied.  I will definitely come back for more.</li>
    <li> Only product that works well on my hair. I have been using this for years and this is a great buy!</li>
    <li> I have never used such a bad product. I bought this item and used it once following the instructions, but it makes the hair oily and sticky. I just used a small amount of that, although I admit the smell is good. Besides, when I contacted the customer service to return this, they told me I not only have to pay the return shipping fee but also the original shipping fee when they shipped to me. I have never had such experience with Amazon since they offer good return service. I understand sometimes I have to pay the return shipping fee, that&#x27;s fine. But it is ridiculous to pay the two shipping fee just because I have to return the product because the therapy itself has problem</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  I dried out my hair so bad due to a triple processes and biosilk brought my hair back to a beautiful shine.</li>
    <li> Great product for your hair at a price that can&#x27;t be beat.  Makes your hair feel great with out the greasy feing.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery, this is the first time purchasing this item on-line, but it is Exactly what I wanted for a lot less!!! Will buy this Again!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. I have colored hair and it makes it so soft and smooth. Can&#x27;t do without it. Will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> Biosilk is a wonderful product I have used for years. I have very course, curly and fragile hair (Sicilian hair...ugh!) and this is one of the only products I trust and love. It is lightweight, silky and even though it appears to be oily it does not make your hair oily. It also is great to use on skin! It smells wonderful and is not overwhelming like some baby oil products which are very....well baby&#x27;ish smelling. I like to smell like a grown up and not a baby&#x27;s bottom :-) The 12oz bottle lasts forever! You only need a dime size amount and my hair is long almost to small of back. It works for all hair types as my friends with all different hair types love it too! Mexican hair, Black hair, thin hair, thick hair....even my lil ones hair! LOVE Biosilk SILK Therapy!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have unrully very curly big purple hair! and this is the only product that keeps the curls from turning into a fro of frizz. I put this on right out of the shower, then follow with MissJessies PillowSoft curls and my hair is good for the day. Some days I use a diffuser for speedy dry time but other days I let it air dry.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair that wants to stand up on top and this product helps my hair be more manageable.</li>
    <li> Not to be mixed up with the smaller 5.64 fl oz (150 mL) bottle! A little bit of serum will go a long way, even for those with thick hair. The 12 oz will surely last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Love it it keeps my hair healthy</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and smooth... Smells great.. I love how it makes your hair soft without that oily feeling like most hair products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years. While expensive, I find it works to help protect and repair damaged hair. I&#x27;ve tried other serums like it, but this is the best by far. The smell is wonderful and it can be applied to both dry and wet hair. If you can get over the cost, it is certainly worth a try!</li>
    <li> Makes hair super smooth</li>
    <li> I love the way Biosilk Silk Therapy feels in my hair, love the way it makes it shine, love the way it smells, and love the cheaper price on Amazon! :)</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My hair dresser used this on me and I loved it so much I had to purchase it for myself. Sweet smelling but not to strong. This product is not heavy on the hair.</li>
    <li> great price. will be using this seller again. thank you.</li>
    <li> The best product for maintaining control of any type of hair-- both curly and straight!&lt;br /&gt;It helps a great deal with frizz and adds an overall delightful shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the prompt service on sending this to me...I buy one about 2 times a year and love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> leaves my hair shiny and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I can believe this great value. Great for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I was expecting. Very liquidity weird stuff. ðŸ‘Ž</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 years now.  It does wonders for my hair, and for my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  It makes our hair shine and very manageable.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who has naturally curly hair or unmanageable hair!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so good for your hair after shampooing.  Keeps it in better shape overall &amp; is a breeze to use</li>
    <li> I used to use this product for long time before this last one, but this time is not the same quality because my hair become too dry.</li>
    <li> It is not original... It has alcohol !!! I think this was refill</li>
    <li> Would have been great product excepted RECIEVED leaking in packaging !!</li>
    <li> Love it! I have a little more confidence knowing my hair is more in control.</li>
    <li> Wow. I am so impressed and pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;First some info about me-&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 28yo Caucasian female with very fine, medium weight/thickness, long (middle of my back), straight auburn hair. I was really frustrated with how dry the bottom five inches (or so) of my hair was. I have a lot of split ends and breakage, and while I wanted to keep my hair long I was almost at my wits end.&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was a last resort, and if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied I was planning on chopping my hair off to shoulder length. After purchasing I though &#x27;this was probably a waste of money and it&#x27;s going to just make my hair oily and gross.&#x27; Well, I was wrong. Thankfully. This stuff is amazing! The first time I applied it to my hair was just out of the shower while my hair was still damp. I applied it to the ends and let my hair air dry. And I was instantly impressed with how soft and smooth my ends felt. The next time I applied it to my already dry hair. I was curious if it would leave my hair feeling oily or damp. Nope! My hair seemed to suck up the stuff and was left feeling just as clean and soft as my first application.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that I really believe that it is repairing my split ends, but it certainly makes my hair softer and more manageable. I no longer have the urge to cut it off, and in fact I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it because it feels so good! I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Works great in my hair.</li>
    <li> It was alright - using it and it&#x27;s good so far&lt;br /&gt;may buy again . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this!</li>
    <li> This serum is the best for frizzy, thick long hair.  It gives your hair such a soft texture that you don&#x27;t even have to use a straightener.  Pair with sulfate free shampoo and you have the most amazing hair ever!  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> after shampooing I put a few drops on my hand and massage into my hair,,,,,curls stay curly,,silver hairs shine  brightly</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I would recommend this to any person that has frizz. It makes my hair feel so silky smoothe.</li>
    <li> I have long coarse wavy hair that is very brittle. It&#x27;s taken me years to figure out what products to use and how to use them. I&#x27;m also a Wen girl (1-1/2 years), and the combination of these two products have allowed me to grow my hair long and healthy. It feels like silk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that some people feel there is a discrepancy between different bottles of Silk -- I&#x27;ve noticed that when I buy a new bottle it is more liquid. Because you use so little of it, the product will evaporate over time. The longer it takes you to use up the bottle, the thicker the product feels. The product still works great when it&#x27;s either thick or thin, but if you&#x27;ve been using an older bottle, and then buy a new one, the feel of the product may surprise or disappoint you because it seems like a different product.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for and I received it in a timely manner</li>
    <li> Great product.  Provides good moisture without leaving hair greasy.</li>
    <li> Thank you great price for great product</li>
    <li> So you just get used to the same haircare products that were such a great price to introduce you to them and the prices go skyhigh.  Looked online and voile same product for way less and no gas.</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly and with moisture, it gets frizzy; this product is the best thing I have found for my hair.  You only have to use very little and your hair will shine and smell so good.</li>
    <li> Great price. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Speedy delivery</li>
    <li> Love it thanks! Good quality hair serum. Worth every penny.</li>
