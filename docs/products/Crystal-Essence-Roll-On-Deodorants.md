<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The very best roll on deodorant I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without Crystal Body Deodorant - it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Does what I read it claims,destroy odor causing bacteria and the plus no harmful chemicals</li>
    <li> Received promptly &amp; as described. Light &amp; works well.</li>
    <li> Deodorizes better than traditional products.  WAY better.</li>
    <li> Have been purchasing this product for a long time.  Works great and seems easy on the bodt.  Good portection.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!  I never smell when I apply it right, and I love that it&#x27;s good for me.  I used to be afraid to try this stuff because I was a definite antiperspirant fan, but I gave this a try.  I was really surprised to see antiperspirant didn&#x27;t actually do much for me, since I don&#x27;t sweat any more wearing this stuff than I did when I was using antiperspirant.  The only thing you need to know before you use this stuff is, the bottle says it must be applied to clean skin, and it means it.  If you don&#x27;t put it on as soon as you get out of the shower, before you do anything else, you will start to smell.  It only works if you put it on as soon as you get out of the shower.  But if you do that it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and I really hated the sticky residue from normal deodorants.  This one rolls on, dries quickly, and keeps my armpits smelling great throughout the day!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is the best. All natural, safe, effective, Great!</li>
    <li> Great product, sized for travel. Been using this and similar salt crystal deodorants for over a decade, and won&#x27;t go back to standard anti perspirant since. I do prefer this roll on liquid solution vs the hard crystal.  Kills the bacteria and prevents it from recolonizing for a few days, let&#x27;s the skin breathe for better health, and you can smell like an actual man instead of perfume or cologne.</li>
    <li> I placed this order without reading the reviews so I was nervous that I wouldn&#x27;t receive 3. However, it came in the mail and I got all three. The Vitamin Shoppe did not fill this order, the Direct Super Center did. I absolutely love this deodorant. I prefer over the solid stick, which strangely started to smell (but I attribute that to my boyfriend who used it). I always use this right after I take a shower and I won&#x27;t stink even after my daily exercise regimen. I don&#x27;t inherently smell, but after using regular deodorant and anti-perspirant, it made me smell bad! So I decided to try this brand and it completely worked. I will never go back to the others! I highly recommend this for those who don&#x27;t have a bad body odor problem. I feel like those who suffer from intense under arm odor may not find this product beneficial. For men, however, this product may work better if you clip your under arm hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years now and finding it on Amazon, in the roll-on, made me very happy.  The spray works just as well but I prefer a roll-on.  I am allergic to normal deodorants so when I was told about this product I bought it immediately.  It has helped me so much and it truly works!!  I would recommend this to anyone, and I do, frequently.</li>
    <li> I tried this as an alternative to \\&quot;aluminum\\&quot; based anti perspirants.  I was very skeptical that this product would work for me, but I was pleasantly surprised.  My underarms were powdery dry all day long!  I had no odor, even after a gym workout.  Excellent product and I trashed my old aluminum based anti-perspirants.</li>
    <li> I truly like this deodorant because it is natural.  The only drawback is that I cannot wear it when I am going to be under alot of stress or the weather is hot.  It does not keep my underarms from sweating as other deodorants do.</li>
    <li> I thought that this \\&quot;crystal body deodorant\\&quot; would be like the last one I bought, which lasted me YEARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, instead of a solid crystal that was pushed up by a plastic screw, this item is a roller-ball on top of a bottle of liquid. How is THAT a \\&quot;crystal body deodorant\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, my underarm hairs sometimes get caught in the roller ball, which is NOT a pleasant sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> AFTER CAREFULLY SHOPPING AROUND FOR THE BEST PRICE, I CHOSE TO BUY THIS BECAUSE IT ADVERTISED \\&quot;PACK OF 3\\&quot;.  WHAT ELSE WOULD &#x27;PACK OF 3&#x27; MEAN???????  I RECEIVED ONE - FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like the Crystal products. About 5 years ago, for some reason, traditional deodorants started making me itch immensely.  I tried hypoallergenic brands, sensitive skin brands, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brands, etc, and everything made me itch so bad.  Then I heard from my aunt about some \\&quot;rock\\&quot; a friend of hers used that worked great.  So I finally purchased the Crystal \\&quot;rock\\&quot; (without any holder or anything).  At first, I wasn&#x27;t impressed , probably because I was so used to the strong smelling traditional deodorants - I could smell some stinkyness with the Crystal.  So I started to go without using any type of deodorant, which really sucks.  We are sure smelly creatures!  I was so self conscious; I hated reaching around people because I could smell myself and I was worried they would smell me too.  After going like this awhile, I couldn&#x27;t even get the smell off in the shower, I could soak in the tub and scrub with soap, and when getting out of the shower my pits would still stink.  So that&#x27;s when I decided to try the Crystal \\&quot;rock\\&quot; again, and it definitely works!  It is not flawless protection, as you can tell since I wasn&#x27;t impressed going from traditional pit stick to this, but after going a year without wearing anything and stinking to high hell, this Crystal does work.  I have now used all forms of Crystal.  The Rock is great, it will last you way over a year, probably even 2 years.  However one day I accidentally dropped it in the sink and it broke into a bunch of pieces; the biggest remaining piece had some sharp edges so I needed to buy a new one.  So I bought The Rock in the plastic holder, and that is definitely nicer.  However one time on a flight it must have gotten whacked because the deal that pushes the deodorant up stopped working.  Then I tried the Roll On Crystal.  I would say that is my favorite form, however you will go through it a lot faster.  A bottle would last me maybe 2 months.  I really liked it though, just a couple swipes and I was good to go.  When I ran out of that I decided to buy the Spray bottle since it is a lot cheaper per ounce, thinking I would use it to refill my roll on bottle; however I could not get the roll on bottle open so I am forced to using it as a spray.  Several reviewers say they can use just 2 sprays, however I am up to 12 sprays per pit just to get decent coverage so the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long either.  So overall, if you have skin sensitivities to traditional pit stick like me, or you worry about the chemicals in traditional deodorant, I would definitely recommend Crystal.  If you want to save money, I would splurge for getting the Rock in the plastic holder because the rock will break if you drop it - you have to wet the rock before using it which makes it slippery, so the plastic holder is great to keep your fingers dry and prevent you from dropping it; if you don&#x27;t  mind the price and want the liquid, I would recommend the Roll On.When I ran out of that I decided to buy the Spray bottle since it is a lot cheaper per ounce, thinking I would use it to refill my roll on bottle; however I could not get the roll on bottle open so I am forced to using it as a spray.

    <li> This product is one of the very few non aluminum products for women on the market and it works better than the other one we found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now and I love it! It takes a few minutes to dry after application but it works great. This price is much cheaper too than in Sprouts.</li>
    <li> I contacted The Vitamin Shoppe today because my order came with only 1 deodorant instead of 3. The description states that you will get 3, but in fact you will not. Vitamin Shoppe did not even want to help me because they said that it was not their error. They told me to take it up with amazon since it was their mistake! I just know that I am NOT gonna get the short end of the stick and get ripped off!!!!</li>
    <li> Hello. I have been curious about crystal and rock deodorants  in the past but did not try it because well... I was believing in sales pitches. I finally decided to give it a try because basically, my armpits have been tender and a little swollen. I noticed that they felt fine after a bit without using deodorant [shower at night and not put anything on...next morning they felt less tender. I stayed at home and used powder for a few days and the swelling and tenderness went completely away.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Amazon box and opened it right up. After my shower I put it on and waited to see what would happen. It has been 7 days now. I put it on after a shower and have even applied more after getting real sweaty from being outside. Not sure I really needed to as I did not smell anything but it seemed like a \\&quot;safe\\&quot; thing to do. Day 7 and this works better than anything I have ever used! I can push on my armpits without discomfort and I don&#x27;t smell when I lift up my arms. Other chemical products I would have to apply several times a day and change Brands several times a year to stay unstinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am extremely pleased that this product works well.</li>
    <li> According to the vitamin store this is suppose to be a dingle pack and they were not responsible for amazon labeling this product as a three pack. However, the item wrks well!</li>
    <li> Being menopausal I never knew that horrid odor is a common complaint.  I have been struggling with this for over 1 year.  I have bought all the &amp;#34;clinical deoderants&amp;#34; they did nothing, as a matter of fact I think it made the odor worse.  Tried alcohol wipes, lemon juice, vinegar and of course scrubbing the heck out of my armpits and using nothing at all.  Okay, pretty graphic huh?  Got to say that this inexpensive deodorant has given me my  life back.  I can wear any fabric without odor.  It is simply a miracle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a more natural deodorant and came across this one.  I like it pretty well and don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s a roll-on formula.  It&#x27;s not runny like others I&#x27;ve tried, so it stays in place.  Maybe a little sticky at first, but it seems to dry pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue is that it doesn&#x27;t always work for me.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far, but some days it fails early and I worry that other people can smell me.  Other days it&#x27;s fine and I have no odor all day long.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be dependent on whether I&#x27;m particularly active or have an easy day, it&#x27;s a bit of a roll of the dice.&lt;br /&gt;Generally, though, it&#x27;s as good as I&#x27;ve found so far.  I like that it&#x27;s unscented, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, I ordered the 3-pack and received 3 containers of deodorant, so I guess they&#x27;ve got that situation worked out now.</li>
    <li> just reordered, so am a repeat customer. My husband and I both love this stuff. Very effective.</li>
    <li> I tried Crystal Body Deodorant about a year or so ago and I loved it!  I originally tried it because it is aluminum, fragrance &amp; paraben-free and was happy that it actually worked really well.  The fact that it is transparent and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes is a definite plus.  I feel much better and safer using a product that is endorsed by Cancer Treatment Centers.  My daughter prefers the spray bottle, but I really like the roll-on.  I have recommended this deodorant to all of my friends and will actually be giving it to some friends this year for Christmas as part of a gift bag with some of my favorite things.  I actually ordered two 3 packs from Home Naturals Inc. at about $7.00 each 3 pack which I thought was a great deal, unfortunately they no longer offer that deal from that company on Amazon and the rest are WAY too expensive so I will definitely be buying this at a supermarket or health food store where they normally sell for $3.00 - $4.00 each.</li>
    <li> I see that earlier reviews mention that they received only one instead of the three-pack. That problem seems to be solved now, as later reviews say they&#x27;ve received three. (I did, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate having a natural product like this for my young daughter... I don&#x27;t want to take the chance of conventional deodorants on a 7-year-old. She doesn&#x27;t need anything heavy, but does need *something,* so I asked around and another mom recommended this to me because her kids&#x27; pediatrician had recommended it to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there&#x27;s controvery about whether or not conventional deodorants may cause harm, but my view is that if you CAN be safer, why not do it? I would definitely suggest trying this to see if it&#x27;s strong enough for you/your kids. It&#x27;s unscented and rolls on easily.</li>
    <li> After about 4 h it fails and you start smelling yourself.... Maybe it works in colder climates but get something else if you sweat, like in Florida.</li>
    <li> I paid way to much money for this product. I was suppose to receive three in the mail and only received one.</li>
    <li> Not only are these great products, but they are a super value! I started off using the scented varieties and they are wonderful--but I can get 3 of these non-scented for the price of 1 scented!  I bought 3 sets of these (total of 9 bottles) and paid less than $15. This will last me a year. Awesome.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant we have ever used.  I feel good about the fact that I am not exposing myself to more chemicals but the best part is that it works.  You may have a little wetness when you work hard but it does not stink.  If you are sweating everywhere else it is not healthy to expect that your armpit should be dry, anyway.   Sweating is healthy as long as it does not smell bad.  We like the convenience of the roll-on.  The spray is too messy and the solid crystal is messy and inconvenient.  BEWARE: This is just ONE roll-on and NOT a pack of 3.  Vitamin Shoppe and Amazon were great in resolving my issue. Amazon is suppose to change the description.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite deodorant, as it is not scented, and keeps me perspiration free with no worries about aluminum compounds (whether they are founded or not).&lt;br /&gt;I slather it on generously, and it keeps me dry till the next shower. I must mention that I am a mature post-menopausal woman, however, and in my younger days I would have required a stronger antiperspirant, as I perspired much more then.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it for years, and it is a hassle to go to the store to look for it, so this three-pack is just the ticket for me.</li>
    <li> Best ever.  Lasts long--in the bottle and under the arms.  I work out constantly and while I sweat a lot, I rarely stink because of this!</li>
    <li> I am getting a little frustrated in my search for natural deodorants --  I have done Toms of Maine and Arm and Hammer -  I have tried all deodorant stones they didn&#x27;t work at all -- I have done this deodorant spray and it didn&#x27;t work at all ----  I am very disappointed with this product  -- My search will continue  --  You put it on and right away I have a body odor --  I take a shower and put this on and failed to work  -- don&#x27;t waste your money --any ideas I am still looking for something to actually work  --</li>
    <li> Works great without any clogging of pores, skin irritation, or sickly smell of cheap perfume odor.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crystal for years because I react to other deoderants/antiperspirants.  It works well.  I like the roll-on better than the stick; it is less messy.  I&#x27;ve tried other products, including one in a blue package that looks similar, but none of them work as well.</li>
    <li> I rarely review products that I purchase and I feel silly making an exception for a deodorant but this product is...well...exceptional. I&#x27;ve tried to make sure that everything that I put in and on my body is free of possibly harmful chemicals. Deodorant has always been my one hold-out because frankly, I&#x27;m stinky. I work in a Doctor&#x27;s office so it&#x27;s important that I not smell bad but even with serious anti-perspirents I&#x27;d be pretty rank by the end of the day. I tried this product because my husband and I are planning a family and after using several totally ineffective natural deodorants I was at a loss. I picked this stuff up and holy crap is it amazing. Even better than conventional anti-perspirents. I walk to and from work but come 5pm I don&#x27;t stink at all.</li>
    <li> I have used this deodorant for years and I simply love it.  It not only keeps me fairly dry but it also stops bad odors, plus it doesn&#x27;t cake up nor leave nasty white streaks nor stains on my clothes. I&#x27;m just glad I don&#x27;t have to trek to the health food store to acquire it. The product came on time with no leakage.</li>
    <li> No strong odors, no fancy chemicals, goes on clear, and you can reapply all you want without any guilt. No more itching allergies. Great value too.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a number of years and absolutely love it. Nothing bad to say and the price here on Amazon is super! I have very sensitive skin and have never had a problem with breaking out. Will use it as long as it&#x27;s being made. Wouldn&#x27;t think of using one of those harsh deodorants with the harmful chemicals. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This item clearly states it is a \\&quot;3 pack\\&quot; however it is for only a single bottle of the product.  The seller, Vitamin Shoppe takes no responsibility for the incorrect listing, citing Amazon as listing it incorrectly.  The really amazing part is that Amazon and Vitamin Shoppe have been notified weeks ago yet they continue to allow the incorrect and misleading ad to remain.  One can only conclude from this that it is intentional false advertising.  BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I like to add essential oils to the ball before I use this under my arms and it&#x27;s working out well... My pits don&#x27;t feel like gunk is stuck to them, like my usual antiperspirant deodorant made them feel. ALSO, as I was researching about natural deodorant, I came across a few threads where acne sufferers, like myself, used the solid version of this on their face, to heal acne. Then, as I researched that, I found that some acne sufferers stopped breaking out when they stopped using antiperspirant deodorants on their pits. The theory is, antiperspirants block the pores to one major place that your body releases it&#x27;s toxins... Your pits! If the toxins aren&#x27;t coming out of your arm pits, they have to come out somewhere else, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had been almost a week of using this roll on crystals deodorant, instead of my regular antiperspirant and I&#x27;d noticed a drastic change in my oily skin and acne. Then, I got the solid for my face and it&#x27;s been life changing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my shower at night, I rub the solid crystal all over my wet face. Then, follow up with a pea sized amount of msm cream, mixed with my sulfur cream (de la Cruz). In the morning, I rinse my face with hot water and a microfiber cloth, then rub the crystal over my wet face again. That&#x27;s it! Also, because I&#x27;m allowing my body to sweat, my body toxins aren&#x27;t trying to come out of my face (ew)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;m not the only one rubbing the solid crystal deodorant on my face, for acne... There was a study done about it and everything!!</li>
    <li> So far so good, this is one of the most non smell intrusive, eco friendly,locally owned deodorant that actually works really well!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t by this product from Amazon, but it is fantastic. I am a sweaty person, and I often smell a little ripe by the end of the day. I decided that since my antiperspirant/ deodorant wasn&#x27;t doing the trick, I may as well give this a shot. After using this, I am convinced that my antiperspirant was actually making me sweat MORE. With the Crystal deodorant, Not only do I smell good all day, I sweat less now. I LOVE this product. I will never go back.</li>
    <li> This is a bare bones and highly effective deodorant. My husband began using it about ten years ago and it has been in our cabinet ever since. Use to be that you could find it locally but people didn&#x27;t know what to make of it and stores stopped stocking it.  Lack of advertising didn&#x27;t help.  Thank goodness for Amazon!    Words of caution -.this price is a per unit price. You will not receive 3 of them, only 1 at that price.</li>
    <li> why have a blob of white under your armpit all the time and get that white deodorant tangled up on men&#x27;s underarm hair. this product works for the whole day without the mess. and it&#x27;s natural!!</li>
    <li> I discovered this product a few years ago and originally bought the solid stick, which worked, but was such a messy pain to use(and it could damage counter tops).  The roll on works really well.  It does not stop perspiration from happening, but it does prevent the smell that comes with it.  I feel good about the safer formulation, and trust this product.  I wish everyone would use it.</li>
    <li> Works well for those who do not perspire heavily. No fragrance, no residue. Better for your body and clothes!</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant EVER! I&#x27;ve been using it for at least the last 10 years, and it&#x27;s always been great.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works well for my husband - although he&#x27;s a strange sort that seems immune to sweating.  He could get by without using anything in the winter.  This did not do a thing for my 11 year old daughter.  She&#x27;s petite, has good personal hygiene and doesn&#x27;t sweat a lot - but when she used this it was as though she wasn&#x27;t using anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using Crystal deodorant, I absolutely loved it.  I could apply it right after my shower in the morning and my armpits would remain odor free until the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that after a few months of use, my bottle started becoming less and less effective.  I thought that my bottle was just getting old, so I purchased a new one.  I didn&#x27;t have better results.  The strange thing was that it was winter when I noticed that it stopped working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not giving this less than a 3 rating because my experience probably won&#x27;t be true for everyone.  I don&#x27;t know what would have changed with my body chemistry to cause it to cease working.  I&#x27;m bummed though, because I really was excited to have a natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a couple other natural deodorants with varying results.  I&#x27;ve found that a simple aluminum free baking soda/organic corn starch mixture works great for my daughter and I.  This mixture works even when I&#x27;m pregnant in 94% humidity.  (If you&#x27;re wondering - the Crystal deodorant stopped working prior to my pregnancy.)</li>
    <li> I see a lot of great reviews, however, I broke out in the worst rash under my right breast area.  It hurts so badly.&lt;br /&gt;I believe in natural stuff and love unscented stuff, but I feel we should also share when problems arise.&lt;br /&gt;I hope I can clear this up on my own.....I know it came from this product.&lt;br /&gt;I do have sensitive skin and I have a very small area where it was starting on my left side.&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful - you never know.</li>
    <li> Lots of pluses: no scent, no stickiness, dries in seconds, no itching, no staining of clothes, works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative: no scent, no stickiness and it dries in seconds(if I forget if I&#x27;ve put it on or not, I can&#x27;t tell by feel or scent and have to reapply it).</li>
    <li> Great deodorant have use it for about 5 years</li>
    <li> I ordered this in December and got a pack of three.  Don&#x27;t rate the product as a one star for a problem with customer service from a seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant works perfectly if followed as directed, to apply to CLEAN underarms.  I always do so right after drying off out of the shower and I only take a shower every other day, no smell!  It&#x27;s safe and inexpensive, I highly recommend this to everyone, already told my family and friends about it and hubby has the &amp;#34;rock&amp;#34; version of it which works great, too, and he&#x27;s constantly walking and sweating every day.</li>
    <li> best deodorant cause its chemical free and keeps you fresh all day</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant . It doesn&#x27;t have any smell but protects you all day from stinking 😊</li>
    <li> Great product, like it better than the solid crystal.</li>
    <li> I did not realize how much my armpit stink until I began using this product. I purchased this at a grocery store and I&#x27;ve tried both the solid and roll-on sticks and they were as effective as applying water to your armpits. In fact, that&#x27;s what it feels like in both cases. After I applied the product, I allowed my armpits to dry but this product still did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product as it does not have aluminum in it.  I have used for years and highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I started using this deo after developing an allergy to something in my previous deo of choice. I love it, it&#x27;s great, no annoying scents, and it works well. I do agree some days it seems to work better than others; but overall it is better than any other; especially if others rest in itchy hives.</li>
    <li> I love these deodorants, Ive been using them for years ever since my mom was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. These work all for any situation...whether you want to go to the gym and workout or if you&#x27;re not doing much...either way this will protect you from odors and it has way less aluminum in it than regular deodorants. My only complaint is that it tends to be quite watery so you have to apply it and let it dry a little before putting on your clothes or you will wet up your shirts. But that doesn&#x27;t really bother me too much.</li>
    <li> I have been using the crystal roll on deodorant for 3 months now and I highly recommend it.  I will say there was about a 3 week adjustment period where it didn&#x27;t seem to work very well and I had to apply it several times a day.  I wonder if that was because the aluminum deodorant that I had been using for years was still wearing off.  This is my favorite deodorant because there is no smell and it isn&#x27;t sticky.  It goes on wet but dries quickly.  The only time I have had to apply it twice in one day was when I went rock-climbing or when I was in Puerto Vallarta in July (very hot very humid) and a few other times when I was outside on hot days and sweating a lot.  On those hot days, I applied the deodorant a second time and was fine the rest of the day.  It might be my imagination but I think I feel healthier since I started using the crystal deodorant too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crystal Roll-On for years and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. I can only find it in Whole Foods and that&#x27;s the only thing I buy there. Selling a pack of three for considerably less than grocery stores and delivering it to my door? Sign me up!</li>
    <li> Be Warned, you will only receive one.  It&#x27;s fine, as far as deodorant goes, but it is not three.</li>
    <li> So, I ordered the crystal roll on, expecting it to renew my relationship with deoderant. I always set the bar too high. What I do like about the crystal roll on is NO IRRITATION (yet, month &amp; 1/2) that in itself is enough to hook me. Although there is still a smell that arises, and hunkers down in my undershirts. I do not smell my underarms throughout the day \\&quot;It works.\\&quot;    It&#x27;s A no nonsense deoderant/ antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Effective without using aluminum. Does not work by just overpowering with fragrance, it actually keeps sweating to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;Now some products work better for some people than others. This is my product and I would say, &amp;#34;Try it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would buy this on Amazon when you can go to any drugstore and purchase this product for $3-4 each.  This is an incredible mark up for something so easily found elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This works!  Keeps away the sweaty smell and it doesn&#x27;t burn like most scented deotarants does to me. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to stay away from antiperspirants and sticking with more natural products.</li>
    <li> This deodorant made my armpits extremely itchy &amp; slimy every time I started to sweat a little. This was especially noticeable whenever I was working out. I really wish I could find a safe &amp; natural deodorant that works, if anyone has any suggestions please let me know!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading a lot lately about products and cancer. With the many causes now being published one falls into deodorant. Based on what I gathered from close friend of mine (Meaghan), the website under Kris Carr, and really all which originated with the Howard Stern show and yes you&#x27;re reading it right. Wether you like the guy or not, he&#x27;s very much into health. In the end, I want to be as healthy as I can be and stay alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance and in the end found that this product really works. I&#x27;ve tried and it works VERY well. Though when you first apply it seems watery, just give it a few moments and it&#x27;ll dry. There after, this product worked. There&#x27;s no sweating from the underarm especially when doing strenuous things as well as no smell which is a concern for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An amazing thing is this product lasted far longer than any product in a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; it out for the weekend. I tried it in the early AM on Saturday and it lasted with NO issues such as smell or dampness. (Sorry not trying to sound gross).  Matter of fact it lasted through the next morning (Sunday) and it was still fine. I&#x27;m completely hooked and absolutely amazed. This is now one step closer to being healthier.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  It&#x27;s best if applied right after your shower/bath.</li>
    <li> love it...received in a very timely manner</li>
    <li> Because of all I&#x27;ve read about the dangers of not allowing the underarm sweat glands to function, (breast cancer....it makes sense to me,) I&#x27;ve been looking for a deodorant as opposed to an antiperspirant.  This product does what I need it to do:  ON MY BODY, it inhibits the grown of odor-causing bacteria while still allowing my underarm sweat glands to release toxins.  I&#x27;ve read negative reviews about this not working for some....but I don&#x27;t sweat all that much....and I bathe daily.  As far as recommending it....I would say &amp;#34;give it a try.&amp;#34;  It may work for you and I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s much safer for the body.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 20 years and would not use anything else.  I have always had sensitive underarms and the Crystal deodorant protects me and keeps me from breaking out.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I finally found a natural deodorant that actually works. I love the liquid form! I have tried the solid crystal deodorant without success</li>
    <li> I have not found a deodorant that does not irritate my skin since Gillette stopped making their spray-on in the brown can.  This crystal deodorant goes on smoothly, does not affect my clothes AND there is NO ODOR.  I still sweat as before - if it clogged up my pores I would get skin eruptions as with previous deodorants. Try Crystal, I feel you will like it too.</li>
    <li> Very effective as a deodorant, and does not contain harmful aluminum. It is not an anti-perspirant, so we use it every day during months that we don&#x27;t perspire, like Spring, Fall and Winter.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this roll-on deodorant for years and really like it.&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly with a little help from my hair dryer on cool setting.  And does the job of ensuring I have no underarm body odor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used  the crystal and stray form of this deodorant, but, for me, the roll on is my favorite.  The others do a great job too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and have been completely satisfied with it. I have chemical sensitivities, so I need natural products. This works for me and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ALWAYS USE this deodorant. I NEVER SMELL and only perspire when I do heavy physical exercise when Florida is especially hot.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY HARMFUL CHEMICALS. The price is good on Amazon, and the delivery was quick. I buy three at a time.</li>
    <li> It has sort of an odd smell; like fruit loops with a hint of feet. It&#x27;s not overpowering, and the smell does not last when applied to skin, but it threw me for a loop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the product works 100% of the time, with no residue or nasty yellowing from sweat. Also, a huge thumbs up for no aluminum or titanium! For the price, this is an incredible deal!</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding deodorants that work for me but this stuff works great!  Also it is free of the ingrediant most deodorants have in it that causes breast cancer. I wish i had found this years ago!&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered twice and even got my sister to loving it too..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good deodorant and it works for me. It gives me the protection I desire. However I did not get mine on amazon simply because it cost a fortune. I only paid $2.79 on Puritan. Other than that I highly recommend this deodorant. I can but thee at the price listed here.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Clear and odorless.  Keeps odor down for ~24 hours.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before, but this item was so awesome, I thought I should let everyone know.  For about a year I have been trying to eliminate chemicals and xenoestrogens from all the products I use.  I started using a colloidal silver deoderant and was moderately happy, but I felt a little uneasy because If I didn&#x27;t reapply often, I noticed.  Also if I went to bed at night after taking a shower, Id be stinky in the morning.  I do crossfit and I run every day and then I&#x27;m doing errands, so I need something that works well and doesn&#x27;t need reapplying.  I ended up using the colloidal silver deodorant on lighter workout days and then regular deodorant if I was going to be out all day or on heavy workout days.  I decided to give the Crystal deodorant a try.  Awesome.  I apply after my shower at night and I don&#x27;t have to re-apply.  It lasts all day and it was so much cheaper than the colloidal silver kind.  I am still shocked.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered it.  My daughter just started needing deodorant and I gave her 1 of the 3 and feel great that she&#x27;s not lathering chemicals all over her body.  I did receive 3.  I would, without a doubt recommend this product.  It must be awesome for me to take the time out of my crazy day to write this review.</li>
    <li> I like the product and it works well.  It was a good buy and cheaper than buying them in the store&lt;br /&gt;separately.  I would buy them again.  It is also healthier than other brands without the aluminum added in.&lt;br /&gt;They only down size is that after a workout I have to reapply it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and this is the cheapest I have found it. I usually pay 4.50 a piece. The product came on time and I saved a bit. Very happy with my purchase and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> This product leaves you smelling fresh all day long, even when you sweat.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is outstanding.  It does not have aluminum, which may cause breast cancer.  The wonderful thing is that it is for men and women.  Its pink top is for breast cancer awareness.  My lady was skeptical, so she took her former deodorant just in case.  She was also amazed.  This stuff is great</li>
    <li> I go out of my way to buy Crystal Body Roll-on Deodorant so I was glad to find it on Amazon. Crystal Roll-on contains few chemicals; does NOT include aluminum chlorohydrate; does not have a strong scent; does not aerosolyze; and conveniently fits in the airport-security, quart-size liquid bags. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I previously tried another brand and it did not work as good as this one.  I prefer this kind of presentation over the rock cristal, since it would always fall and shatter into tens of useless pieces.</li>
    <li> This product is good but not as good as the solid, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> product works arrived quickly very good price will keep supporting local sellers thank you</li>
    <li> This is a good deodorant for people with sensitivity to other deodorants to try to see if they can tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is very sensitive, and this is about the only one she can use.</li>
    <li> It is a sticky liquid when it goes on.  I haven&#x27;t done any odor-producing exercise to see how well the deodorizing works.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant I really use anymore.  There are a lot of possible health issues with using anti-perspirant long-term, but this is the only deodorant that has done a good job of keeping odor away – the others just don&#x27;t stack up.  It goes on clear and easy.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, has no aluminum Chloride which is linked to cancer and has no waxy feel.  Great product. Getting harder for find in stores.  So happy it is available on line.</li>
    <li> This goes on quickly without the need for water (as with the stick form).  This works very well to prevent odor.  The only time I&#x27;ve noticed an odor is after wearing it all day and then doing heavy exercise.</li>
    <li> No odor. You can still sweat, which I actually want when I&#x27;m working out. I&#x27;ve had breast cancer heard that the regular kind is a carcinogen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of crystal deodorant, but always come back to Crystal Body brand.  (I also like Lafé, but it&#x27;s more expensive.)  I tried another brand, but it caused a rash.  The minute I went back to this brand, the rash disappeared!  I&#x27;ve used this brand for many years now and, having learned my lesson, will stay with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Secret deodorant for awhile now until I heard about the harmful effects of aluminum on the human body. I also decided to switch over from conventional deodorant because of the white powdery stuff it would leaves on my clothes even with it being advertised as being &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34;. My local Safeway was running a buy one get one free on this deodorant and decided to check it out. Originally I wanted the Crystal Body Stick deodorant which I hear is very economical since you can use it for a year without running out. One of the downfalls of it was the fact it requires water to be sprayed on it initially so you can apply it to your underarms. This rollerball does not need water and so far, it has been one of the best investments I have ever made. This thing really is invisible and I never have red or bumpy underarms after shaving. I noticed this was more frequent and my skin was much more irritated with conventional deodorant. As much as I sweat during my workouts, I never have any BO problems. Definitely try this product! This product does not last as long as the Crystal Body Stick deodorant but it has been lasting for a long time now. I would say you can get a good three or three and a half months out of this deodorant.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells like smelly arm pits even before you put it on.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product...I used to use Secret for yrs but unfortunately I ended up getting a cyst under my armpit which made me stop using antiperspirants.  I was recommended this product thats natural and it doesnt have that component that helps with perspiration but it definitely helps you with the smell.  So this product will definitely give you a nice scent but it does not help you  with the sweat.  Its natural to sweat so no point in stopping that.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this and like it!  As long as I remember to put it on right out of the shower it works great!</li>
    <li> Great product really works at a good price.  I will order again </li>
    <li> Best deoderant ever!  Doesn&#x27;t leave any annoying marks on your clothing and lasts all day long with no reapply. Will order again and again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Works great and is healthy for you too!  Always arrives ahead of time and in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Love this.... safe, no scent and really, really works.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this deodorant, and it is getting harder and harder to find it in stores. I may start hoarding....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a deodorant that was JUST a deodorant and NOT an antiperspirant. I also wanted one that did not have any scent to it. And, well, it also had to actually WORK. This is by far the best. I have tried Tom&#x27;s brands, and they are not as good as Crystal. I like this roll on form more than the actual crystal Crystal. I feel I get better under arm coverage with the roll on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put this on after a shower, and I am good to go all day, in dry (AZ) and humid (VA) heat. No body odor smell, and no &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; smell either - bad b.o., or powder fresh, or amazon rain, or what have you. Just nothing. Which is EXACTLY what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect, perfect, perfect!</li>
    <li> This stuff WORKS! We&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for several years with no complaints.</li>
    <li> In an effort to stop using chemicalized deodorant, I bought this product.  It works pretty well, although I had to adjust to the fact it will not stop perspiration, only odor.  And it does that well, unless it&#x27;s a very hot and muggy day with lots of exertion involved. With the chemical-free trade off I think it&#x27;s well worth it.  However, if I were giving an important presentation I would probably use my other deodorant.</li>
    <li> Yes  love it keep making this safe no scent yet great deoderant thx medicine</li>
    <li> Great protection without the scent.</li>
    <li> I have to use deodorant that does not contain aluminum or any plant oils, gels, or extracts. This is the best deodorant I have found that does its job with those restrictions. Highly recommended for those with fibromyalgia on the guaifenesin protocol.</li>
    <li> Excellent product especially if you don&#x27;t need to control wetness.  This deodorant controls odor very well but wouldn&#x27;t be so good in a very humid climate.  Other products cause my underarms to break out but not this one.</li>
    <li> wow, this stuff really works---better than anything in a drug store.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use regular deodorant because it makes painful little balls underarms (I forgot the official name for it) so I got this at my local drugstore. It works great for me during cooler to colder temperatures but in the summer time I find that I need to reapply twice a day for adequate odor protection. Also, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant and I sweat a decent amount when it&#x27;s hot out. This is a great price though and I&#x27;d recommend getting it if you&#x27;re dealing with cooler weather. One bottle lasts around 5 months for me.</li>
    <li> Just received mine and it is, in fact, a three-pack. I&#x27;m not sure if another company was shipping this before but it&#x27;s as advertised now. I had never tried this product before but it works perfectly! I&#x27;ve never had luck with &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorant before but I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few months and just reordered it.  We&#x27;re unfortunately having a heat wave, and this doesn&#x27;t hold up AT ALL.  Okay during cold months, not for summer use.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crystal products for years now, due to my sister&#x27;s holistic approach to the world.  She bought me my first one.  Anyhow, I like the stuff, it works without all of the smell that comes with standard deodorants.  It is not an antiperspirant! So, if you sweat a lot, it will wash away and will need some help.  I started with the little rock, it is too hard to handle, slippery when wet!  I then moved to the solid in a plastic container, much better, but when it wears down, it will not stay in the container and you are back to the little slippery rock.  I then tired this liquid, much easier to apply but didn&#x27;t last near as long and cost way more.  The biggie for me was I started to break out under my arms when I used it regular.  So stopped, went back to the rock in the container and commercial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now back to the liquid, I have found the secret!  I little goes a long way.  I was putting to much on when the rash was appearing.  So, here is what i do now and have no problems.  Right after my shower, dry off, apply the roll on, being careful about the amount, then I take my hand and spread the stuff around the whole area!  I know, gross but I just took a shower!  It lasts a lot longer this way, cheaper than commercial stuff, no smell from the product or the armpit, no rash and your armpits have a holistic approach to the world.  The stuff is basically just salt!  Try it, you might like it.  I would think this to be perfect for women, who don&#x27;t sweat very much!</li>
    <li> I bought this trying to find a more natural, yet effective deodorant...I work in a laid-back job, where I can more or less move at my own pace-I am on my feet most the day, but barely moving around... This deodorant works for about an hour, and then stops.  I could notice myself stinking.  And like has been said, it won&#x27;t work at all unless applied to PERFECTLY CLEAN skin, i.e. right out of shower and dried skin.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I thought \\&quot;Pack of 3\\&quot; meant three items. Wrong. Only one item was sent. Not a good value for that price.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived fast</li>
    <li> I like the deodorant because it rolls on easily.  It is not sticky nor odious and it is gentle.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, product as described!</li>
    <li> great product- good price-well wrapped</li>
    <li> I love Amazon.com  My favorite deodorant (Crystal) is cheaper. Very excited. If you&#x27;re a cancer survivor and want to remain cancer free, this is the deodorant for you.</li>
    <li> I had developed a sensitivity to the Deodorant/Antiperspirant I had been using that caused an itchy, red rash in my armpits.  After reading the reviews of this product, I decided to try it and have been amazed at how effective it is as a deodorant;  I previously found that ordinary deodorant was not enough for me, I needed an antiperspirant.  This Crystal Body Deodorant is so effective, I have no trace of underarm odor even if skipping a day of showering.  Also, I have had no further problems with a rash.  Five stars for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way, contrary to at least one negative review here, I did receive three bottles of the deodorant, as advertised.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It dries quickly, and works all day. The fact that it’s a more natural deodorant on top of it, makes it even better!</li>
    <li> After 2 days of use I am amazed at how dry my underarms are all day (not sticky like the regular natural deoderants) and even after 24 hours my armpits dont stink and I live in a subtropical climate. Mind you I work in an office but even the trip from work to home in the heat and humidity and I still wake up next am before a shower and have no stink. I am hooked on this and most likely wont ever go back to the old stuff again (Natural stick deoderant).</li>
    <li> I think this works perfectly - am very happy with this purchase .</li>
    <li> Have used Crystal Body Deodorant Roll-On for several years and find it effective.  I believe it is kinder to the body than mainstream products.</li>
    <li> Works great if you are allergic to other deodorants</li>
    <li> Honestly it didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all.</li>
    <li> I am trying so hard to find something natural.  This is not it.  It did come 3 in a pack and was shipped quickly and safely.  It does not work for me whatsoever.  I guess I just have to deal with the fact that I need antiperspirant.  I swear I stunk more wearing this roll-on then when I do not wear anything at all.  I would not recommend.  The smell was so offensive, I could hardly believe it was me.</li>
    <li> I have used the Crystal roll-on for several years with great success. However, on the latest order of 3, on two of them, the rollers are jamming, making an application virtually impossible. I have called the manufacturer&#x27;s  1-800 number on the item and had to leave a message. I am waiting to hear back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up 3/1/13: My call was returned the same day, the very professional rep apologized, took down the batch number of the defective item and told me a replacement is being sent.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for anyone. Works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve developed a contact dermatitis from exposure to aluminum chlorohydrate.  Crystal deodorant is great, since it contains none of the chlorohydrate.</li>
    <li> Contains potassium aluminum sulfate! It does not contain the aluminum chlorohydrate found in most anti-perspirants but it does have aluminum. The claim is that the potassium alum compound is too big to be absorbed through the skin, but there are no studies to back this up so how can we be sure? I wish I had done my research before I was duped into thinking it was aluminum-free.</li>
    <li> Great value. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Wow!  After a 2-year long search, I have finally found a natural deodorant that keeps me from smelling!  This stuff is amazing.  You are definitely going to sweat like you normally do, but there is absolutely no odor.  I also love that there are no white marks on my shirts anymore.  You simply wet the rock (or apply right after the shower when your armpits are still wet) and apply to your underarms.  It dries relatively quickly (5 to 10 seconds) and then, that&#x27;s it!  No marks on your clothes, no yellow stains on white t-shirts, no smell (fragrance OR body odor!), no residue.  I can&#x27;t believe this works.      I&#x27;ve tried TONS of natural deodorants and this is the absolute best.  Save yourself the money and just switch to this now.  The travel size will probably last me a year, which I&#x27;m so excited about.</li>
    <li> Stated that you would get a pack of 3. Only one came. I called up The Vitamin Shoppe. They said it was Amazon&#x27;s fault.They said that they have never sold it as a 3 pack. I guess that I will have to dispute it with my credit card company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the stuff in regular antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;This works, I prefer the roll-on, maybe it&#x27;s habit, but I feel it&#x27;s cleaner application.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would be easier to find, but overall it&#x27;s a good product that has become a regular for me.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! I would give it 10 stars if I could. It rolls on easily, and does not pluck out hairs. It works perfectly and the best part is that it washes off easily. I used to use Speedstick as my favorite, but hated all the chemicals and especially hated the feeling I got taking a shower and trying to wash under my arms. It was a sticky/chalky feeling. Plus, I had to worry about not letting dark clothes touch the deodorant for fear of getting white streaks on my clothes. I no longer have that concern. I also like that it is unscented, so it does not combine with my cologne, etc. I also love that it is much cheaper on Amazon! Win-win! I will never go back to the other stuff again....oh, and one more thing...this is under 3 ounces! You can take it on a plane! Woo-hoo!</li>
    <li> maybe keeps you smelling ok, but doesn&#x27;t dry up your pits, i know it&#x27;s supposed to be healthier but i can&#x27;t stand to be wet. i won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> Both adults in our family have used this, and the hard counterpart, and love it.  The roll-on does take a while to dry.</li>
    <li> I was turned onto Crystal products by my brother who is vegan and raved about the non-alumnium and overall benefits of the stick. I live in a dorm in college with communal bathrooms so having to wet the stick before I put it on was a no-go for me so I decided to try the roll-on. Overall, I say its great. I love that it genuinely has no scent and that I don&#x27;t smell like B.O and baby powder at the end of a long day or exercising. However, I do walk a few miles everyday to work and often have to run if I&#x27;m about to be late and in addition to the summer heat, I can smell like I never even put on deodorant in the first place. For me, this is a great mild deodorant for non-strenuous work like if I&#x27;m running light errands or simply relaxing in the house, but for some reason, even though I don&#x27;t sweat much at all, it won&#x27;t hold me if I&#x27;m running or walking swiftly in the heat. But I would still definitely buy this product and I recommend it to all who need a good everyday (non-workout, strenuous activity) deodorant.</li>
    <li> If you like the rock style, this work better. I am allergic to the aluminum based deodorants and antiperspirants. I get the itchy and sore pits in hours of using even the &amp;#34;non-irritating&amp;#34;. This Crystal brand works fabulously. Get it with or without scents. This three pack is good value and price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Crystal Body Deodorant Roll-On for several years now. I will not use anything else. I like that it comes unscented. It works great and I do not have to pollute my body with all these chemicals that all the other deodorants contain, Crystal is chemical free.</li>
    <li> As for it&#x27;s effectiveness, it&#x27;s okay.  I&#x27;m not smelly, but on a hot summer day, I don&#x27;t come home super fresh either.  It has no scent, which can be good or bad depending on your preference.  It appears to aggravate my shaving bumps more than other deoderants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ball on mine doesn&#x27;t roll, so I squeeze out some of the liquid and then wipe it on with the stuck ball.  Because it&#x27;s slippery, this works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh, but EWC rates it highly and I prefer this to the chemicals in alternative options.</li>
    <li> pretty much does the job without to much toxic load</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for years and says it works great for her and I have to agree.</li>
    <li> Knew I liked the product.  Have used it for years. Now I like the price.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant for me - used for years.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve used for a decade. Glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product, much better than mess of the Crystal Rock.</li>
    <li> wonderful natural product</li>
    <li> great product because I can only use deodorant without aluminum</li>
    <li> My husband has had problems with deodorant leaving large red patches under his arms and down his sides. We tried several things before he switched to this. He is very concerned with cleanliness and loves that this controls odor so well but doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
    <li> I turned to a more natural solution because after having to scrape dove deodarant off my underarms 3 or 400 times in the shower got really annoying. This 4 some reason did not work instantenously 4 me ( I could still smell funk) but after 3 weeks of use 2x a day i had my aha moment. The reason it works is because it forms a barrier with the minerals salt btwn u n ur sweat glands which keeps bacteria on my skin from interacting  w/the glands(I found out bacteria on the skin is where the odor comes from not actual sweat). Although it would be nice to not sweat, I look at sweat as natures air conditioner because thats what it is. So even though u may sweat u won&#x27;t stink. Remember your skin must be clean first b4 using or it won&#x27;t work! * I recommend at the gym using a light layer of dove or speed stink over this because 4 some reason this is not strong enough to stop odors after a strenuous excercise which is also why I could only give it 4 stars not 5.</li>
    <li> I like the roll on because it is less messy than the stick. It keeps your perspiration from smelling, and it chemical free. I highly recommend it for people who are concerned about aluminum and parabens. Plus, it&#x27;s cheap and if you don&#x27;t like it, you don&#x27;t have to use it. Also, because it&#x27;s chemical free, you can put it other places where you have odor from bacteria, like your feet. You can&#x27;t do that with a regular deodorant/antiperspirant. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> excellent product..does not stain clothing and does not contain harmful chemicals</li>
    <li> Looked for it everywhere and found it here. Does the job without the extra ingredients that irritate.</li>
    <li> This does come in stick form, which I normally prefer, but I actully like the roll-on more. I love that it is the crystal and is truly odorless and not sticky. Dries quickly, lasts well. Have used for a few years and plan to keep on.</li>
    <li> My son is a typical boy.  He has no use for mirrors and personal grooming of any kind.  He thinks that being smelly and funky is cool and bathing and water in general are totally unneeded.  So when I got a chance to try Crystal Body Deodorant Roll On, I figured this might be the chance to sneak in some personal grooming for my kid under the guise of helping mom with a blogging review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crystal Body Deodorant Roll On is made of natural mineral salts which help prevent body odor by creating an invisible protective barrier against odor bacteria. There are only three ingredients - water, natural mineral salts and cellulose. No aluminum&#x27;s, fragrances or chemicals are used and it is hypo-allergenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;The first day we tried it, I had some back-up deodorant in my purse just in case this stuff did not work.  But I am happy to say that it worked, even when the weather in Detroit was unseasonably in the 80&#x27;s during the first week of October.  And it goes on clear and smooth with no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crystal Body Deodorant Roll On retails for around $3.60 for a 2.25 oz bottle.</li>
    <li> Like this a lot.  I am allergic to regualr deodorant and this one is perfect.  It is natural and never had any more problems and it keeps me fresh and secure all day long.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like roll-ons but this one surprised me. I had been looking for a natural deodorant for a long time and decided to buy this one and try it out. Once it arrived, I put it to the test. I took a shower and then I put a good amount of it on and it took about 10 minutes to totally dry. Once it was dry I put on a purple t-shirt and went about my day. It was mid 80s in southern California last week and I was out all day in the sun and I sweating a lot. At the end of the day there was no smell at all. Not being satisfied yet, I decided to go to bed without taking another shower. My purple t-shirt was stain free. Next morning when I woke up I still didn&#x27;t smell at all. Then I did a 25 minute exercise and at the end of that I started to smell a little. By now it had been over 26 hours that I had applied it. I rested for about 30 minutes and did another 25 minute aerobic exercise and after that I smelled like I hadn&#x27;t taken a shower in over a week. So in all it lasted about 28 hours on mid 80s weather, and 50 minutes of exercising with no stains left on shirts. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more. I have been using it for a week now with the same results.</li>
    <li> No harsh chemical ingredients, I use it every morning &amp; I work for the Highway Dept. Its definitely worth buying</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Everything like it should be. No problem.Works well</li>
    <li> This product is great. It lasts for about 6 hours for me. I use it usually when I&#x27;m at home or running errands. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue like other deodorants do and it keeps my underarms smooth after a shave.</li>
    <li> We order it over and over. My husband is allergic to regular deodorant and he has been using it for years. It is hard to find in stores, but this 3 pack through Amazon is great.</li>
    <li> I had to switch from the crystal stone itself to the roll-ons since I&#x27;m a clutz and can&#x27;t hold the stones more than a few times without them slipping and cracking on the ground. Just a few swipes back and forth of the roll-on has the same odor-preventing effect as the stones, so I&#x27;ll stick with these.</li>
    <li> No swelling of my lymph nodes under my arms!  No bad body order!  This product works for me!  I strongly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over 20 years. I am allergic to aluminum chlorohydrate  and you can&#x27;t find a deodorant with out it. I first used the stones but the roll on is much easier. I&#x27;ve got my husband using it also. The natural crystal potassium alum salts kills all the bacteria quickly without any irritation. I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t make my underarms am itchy disaster. Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this daily, lasts an entire day.</li>
    <li> love this stuff! Great sellers, too</li>
    <li> I prefer Naturally Fresh crystal roll-on. I have to apply this product twice per day, while I only need to apply Naturally Fresh once after I shower.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It works great for 24 hours and is all natural! Sometimes cheat if no time for morning shower and get away with it another day.</li>
    <li> I use this deodorant as in on my feet, rubbing a bit of on my fingers then applying to toes, or I just rolls it directly to the bottoms of my feet. I keep a separate roll-on just for my feet in the winters, wearing hot socks, or knee highs. It is great. Crystal Body Deodorant roll-on is absolutely perfect for under breasts and roll directly onto private areas for extra odor control after showering. Perfect! No irritation and it works for long days.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not one of those people that goes and reviews a natural deodorant expected to get an antiperspirant, but this deodorant just didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I&#x27;ve used other natural deodorants that at least deodorize the BO a bit, like they&#x27;re supposed to do.  This product was basically useless to apply alone because without being combined with something else, it was as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing anything.  When I came home at night my armpits (and my clothes) would smell putrid. I&#x27;d have to wash everything after wearing it only once.  Perhaps it was because it was unscented, I don&#x27;t know. Also, you can&#x27;t reapply it throughout the day--this will do nothing to get rid of body odor and will also contaminate the stick with your smell (hence the \\&quot;only apply to clean underarms\\&quot; directions on the label.  And trust me, you&#x27;ll need to reapply with something after using this!  Maybe it was just me--there were a lot of positive reviews, maybe it depends on your body chemistry.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product which I have used for years now.  It works, and (very importantly) works with all natural ingredients.  If you shower daily, it will do the job for you, even in humid summers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the current Amazon price for this is steep!  I habitually check out Amazon prices when setting up online purchases.  Amazon&#x27;s current price is $14.19 (per 3-pack), which is  $4.73/bottle.  In contrast, at an online retailer I frequent, the price is $2.79/bottle.  If I order $75 or more there, the final price is $2.51/bottle, including free shipping.  Of course, with Amazon Prime I get free shipping on anything, but I use that option only for attractive prices.  Granted, customers with more money than time may not care much about the costs of little things, and if that&#x27;s true for you, then no worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding this item&#x27;s usefulness, I especially recommend it to those who&#x27;ve have their field of vision limited to deodorants which they recognize, due to big advertising budgets.  Very importantly, ads generally distract consumer attention with claims of product advantages, while slyly by-passing the question of \\&quot;what will the chemicals in these products do to one&#x27;s health?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer claims of \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; have no identifiable meaning.  Hence, it&#x27;s a term which is not to be confused with \\&quot;safe.\\&quot;  If generalizations like this had legal meaning, of course, manufacturers would be far more careful in using them.  (As but one egregious example of description perversion, the FDA authorizes manufacturers to label a product as \\&quot;certified organic,\\&quot; even when the brain neurotoxin, Neotame, has been added as a sweetener.) Given the junk science too often practiced by the corporate-governmental complex, commercial assurances of safety or \\&quot;naturalness\\&quot; beg for independent verification, including examining the list of stated ingredients yourself.  In general, deodorants tend to be filled with the kinds of chemicals one would never knowingly ingest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holistic physician, Dr. Mercola, has recommended not applying anything to your body that you wouldn&#x27;t be able to consume safely by mouth (which yes---likely would omit most of the products an average consumer--busy with life--might hurriedly toss into the shopping cart).  Even so, the skin is the body&#x27;s largest organ, and will distribute to the body whatever it absorbs.  The toxic load Americans already carry from tens of thousands of chemicals in our environment is an invisible strain on the immune system.  It is unnecessary to add to that load through our personal product choices.  Happily, a plethora of non-chemicalized personal care products exist, such as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to this product and care about your health, do give it a try.  That&#x27;s what I did.  At the time I discovered this product, I&#x27;d just learned I was gluten intolerant, and that my current deodorant actually listed gluten as an ingredient.  On the one hand, the Mayo Clinic says that gluten cannot be absorbed through the skin.  On the other hand, I didn&#x27;t want to risk tiny underarm shaving nicks perhaps giving deodorant gluten access to my bloodstream.  Despite my non-gluten concerns, however, I was still reluctant to try this, due to unfamiliarity with the product.  At this point, however, my on-going satisfaction with the product is such that I was moved to write this review.  You may well experience a positive outcome, also.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the try.ngly ingest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holistic physician, Dr. Mercola, has recommended not applying anything to your body that you wouldn&#x27;t be able to consume safely by mouth (which yes---likely would omit most of the products an average consumer--busy with life--might hurriedly toss into the shopping cart).

    <li> I was really hopeful. I tried this deodorant hoping to be able to stop using the regular products with Aluminium-based ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked great for the wetness but it did nothing for the odor. And this is not something I am willing to compromise on. A deodorant must solve both problems.</li>
    <li> Only deodorant I use.  Long lasting and no aluminum.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant we ever use !!! Works for my husband and I perfectly, and we are mature adults with mature odor if not controlled.&lt;br /&gt;Works even during the summer months even for my husband who has a very physical job. One note: sometimes it is good to allow it to dry , you can air dry or use a cool blow dryer . Mostly we apply and run though and it always works ! Fantastic that it&#x27;s a roll on and has not fragrance too.</li>
    <li> Thought this was the actual crystal. A little disappointed but it works just as well</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff a lot and it works unlike my experience with competitor brands. It drys quickly, is easy to apply, the roller works smoothly.</li>
    <li> I have hidradenitis suppurativa, the Dr said I could no longer usr razors to shave under my arms and could no longer use certain deodorants...had to be clear and no aluminum chlorohydrate, nothing to clog my pores. Thank God for your product. I recommend this product to everyone!!! I use to use the crystal rock and you can use it on any part of your body to control body odors! Yes people even your groin area and feet ; ) I wae delighted to find this now in a roll on and spray!  Thank you so much Crystal company.</li>
    <li> Have used this natural deodorant for a while.  I have tried a lot of other natural deodorants but I keep coming back to this product.  It does not make my underarms itch.  It also controls odor well.  The ball part of the roll-on package doesn&#x27;t work the best but it can be worked around.</li>
    <li> I use the Crystal Body Deodorant roll-on everyday. I feel better using this because it does not contain aluminum. I really don&#x27;t know much else about its safety. Everything you put on your skin has the potential to be absorbed into the skin and I can at least rest assured that I am avoiding many of the chemicals from virtually every big-name antiperspirant and deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works. I don&#x27;t stink. It is easy as any other roll-on to use.</li>
    <li> Across the lid of this product it doesn&#x27;t say \\&quot;NO Aluminum\\&quot; with a breast cancer awareness ribbon next to it, it says \\&quot;NO Aluminum Chlorohydrate\\&quot;. I should have read better, but I also think this company shouldn&#x27;t be so crafty. They used the breast cancer symbol next to their statement because recent research has found a correlation between aluminum and the behavior of breast cells. Potentially, this research could eventually find aluminum is linked to breast cancer. They prey on our concerns by saying \\&quot;NO Aluminum Chlorohydrate\\&quot; and leave out the fact the research is on ALL aluminums, not just this one type commonly used in deodorants. This deodorant contains natural mineral salts in the form of Potassium Alum, which is a form of aluminum! It doesn&#x27;t matter it&#x27;s a natural source or not. Poison Ivy is very natural yet it will do you no good to rub it all over you. The same goes for aluminum even if it makes you less stinky and is from a natural source. I&#x27;m going to keep looking for an effective aluminum free deodorant.</li>
    <li> Some days or works some days it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t believe I was going to like the sticky feeling of a roll on; not here this product is great!  It drys quickly almost as soon as you put it on.  I especially like to layer; first place the deodorant on and then layer with your favorite scent.  I am on the &#x27;subscribe and save&#x27; delivery for this product!</li>
    <li> Best re-applied once for the evening.  Doesn&#x27;t stain!</li>
    <li> Much convenient than the stone. Good value</li>
    <li> No stickiness, no residue, no scent, no aluminium, and no body odor. I&#x27;ve also tried the solid and spray version but the roll-on is the most convenient and effective of them all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a keeper for me.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many, many deos- with aluminum, without, from the worst for you to the most organic and this one works.  I need wash and reapply a couple times during the day in the hot summer months, but i rarely have even a slight scent.  It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, so i do sweat, but i&#x27;m lucky b/c i don&#x27;t sweat that much in my underarms.  Definitely worth a shot if you&#x27;ve tried it all!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Need to apply a few coats (3-4) for it to last all day, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years, and if you are allergic to deodorants which contain additives that may cause an allergic reaction, I suggest that you give the Crystal Unscented Roll-On deodorant a try.  It has worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> Finally a natural deodorant that actually works!  I have tired many and am thankful to find out that doesn&#x27;t have the aluminum in it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order this product here, but wanted to say how much I love it!  When applied correctly, either the roll on, stick or spray on keep me odor free all day, no matter how much I sweat.  To be fair, I don&#x27;t sweat heavily, so the moisture isn&#x27;t a problem for me-just the odor.  I have been using various forms of this product for about 4 months now and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> When I bought this deodorant for the first time, my husband actually made fun of me for being so gullible as to think it could actually work. Who&#x27;s laughing now? Well, ok - nobody, because deodorant that works has limited comic value. This has the excellent property that it doesn&#x27;t create yellow armpit stains, and it doesn&#x27;t make you smell like baby powder or a pine forest. It lasted a long time, too. I have no idea whether it would work well on men - I fear it might not be strong enough for that, but for a woman it&#x27;s fine and it&#x27;s nice not to be smearing petrochemicals under my arms anymore!</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant because it has no aluminum. I rated it 5 for that reason and also for the quick delivery. I recommend this deodorant to everyone!</li>
    <li> I NEEDED TO FIND THIS  CAUSE I GOT TO DO RADITION AND THEY TOLD ME THIS WAS THE BEST TO USE AND I GOT A GOOD PRICE AND THE SELLER DONE A GOOD JOB GETTING IT TO ME</li>
    <li> I was VERY skeptical when trying out this deodorant. I&#x27;ve been a regular scented antiperspirant/deodorant person my whole life. Shockingly, there is NO smell when I sweat. And when I used my old regular deodorant, sometimes I could smell sweat a little bit. But when I apply this to my whole underarm, it works great. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better it is than my old deodorant. And knowing that I&#x27;m not applying chemicals to my body makes me feel even better. This definitely goes on my list of things I wish I had done sooner. Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t make white marks on my sleeveless dresses!!! I definitely recommend and will not be going back to regular deodorant.</li>
    <li> First off, I want to mention that I only buy unscented deodorants because many scents give me migraines. I&#x27;ve tried just about every unscented deodorant under the sun but haven&#x27;t yet found something I really love. I was skeptical when I started using the crystal spray on deodorant but it really works. This usually prevents me from sweating entirely but if I do manage to break a sweat it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. I bought the roll on to replace my crystal spray because it&#x27;s a little annoying to apply. I highly recommend getting this roll on version instead as it&#x27;s much easier to deal with and it&#x27;s the exact same product. This product also doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum like most deodorants do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous natural deodorant products, and this one is my favorite.  It&#x27;s not runny when applied, it&#x27;s long-lasting, and it works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of deodorant for years now... This or something similar... The same active ingredient, which works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is odorless... It is not covering up smell, but killing the bacteria that live in your pits and cause body odor.  If you are very smelly, you can use it WITH other products... Put it on when you get out of the shower, then put something else on later before leaving for the day.  After using this product for a week or two, it should be all you ever need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I had previously used other types of deodorant, but after a while they would stop working, sometimes I would  stink more after using a product for a while.  This is now all I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great before going to the gym... It&#x27;s NOT an anti-perspiration product... You will sweat normally, just not smell when you do.  If you don&#x27;t want to sweat, use it WITH an anti-perspiration product.  Still controls odor great.</li>
    <li> I have never needed to use a deodorant with anti-perspiration (Aluminum Chlorohydrate).  However, my underarms started to have an allergic reaction to the fragrance in my deodorant. So about 8 years ago, I switched to Crystal Body Deodorant.  I first used the solid stick (looks a little like rock candy) and eventually used the roll-on.  I have been using the roll-on for about 6 years and could not be happier.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few weeks now. So far, I feel that it does help maintain my underarm odor and glides on easily. Although when I go to the gym, I apply a stronger deodorant just as a precaution. I like that it is all natural and still gets the job done. My only concern deals with how much liquid the roll-on lets out. At times, it floods my underarm and I have to air out my shirt or wait to put my shirt on for a bit. Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;ve used deodorant at all with this stuff.  Not worth the money in my opinion.  : (</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve used it for over a year now, I think. I have strong body odor and this product works well for me. It also leaves no residue on my clothing or stuck in my underarm hair (yes, I&#x27;m a girl, and no, I don&#x27;t shave) like white stick deodorant. Unlike regular deodorant stones/crystals, this is a roll-on, so it doesn&#x27;t break when I drop it. And it&#x27;s unscented, so it doesn&#x27;t make my armpits smell like jasmine or &amp;#34;Shower Fresh&amp;#34; or Froot Loops - seriously, some women&#x27;s deodorant has overwhelmingly strong, sweet scents, and I hate that, especially when I want to wear perfume! I really prefer unscented, like this.</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant a lot.  It works and it&#x27;s all natural.  I will definitely buy it again.  The item arrived promptly and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> Amazing and healthy. Arrived right on time. Thank you</li>
    <li> This deodorant doesn&#x27;t work for me at all, and I so want it to. Even combined with Weleda deodorant spray (I have both the Sage and the Citrus) I smell foul less than 1/2 way through the day. Sigh.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that does not leave you sticky, has no added smell, washes off cleanly and most importantly provides all day odor protection without leaving marks on your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is I am a man and it is lame to have to carry around a pink deodorant container.  Any reason why they could not go with a more neutral color to the package?</li>
    <li> It works better than other natural brands.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if you are aware, but All deodorants crystals, crystal deodorant roll-ons, and crystal deodorant sprays contain either: Ammonium Alum, also known as ammonium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate or Potassium Alum, also known as potassium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate. Both potassium and ammonium alum have the same potential toxicity as Aluminum Chlorohydrate there for its an Aluminum salt just like aluminum chlorohydrate. Crystal deodorants are no better for you than antiperspirants containing aluminum chlorohydrate.</li>
    <li> This product is a better alternative to more traditional deodorant; however, it still has aluminum salts as the active ingredient. Some research has me aluminum to such diseases as Alzheimer&#x27;s, so I personally have been trying to find a deodorant that works with out using aluminum ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to note that I did indeed receive a pack of three and my order. I thought the price for three was a very good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product three stars because it seems to me to be trying to mislead the consumer with claims that there is no aluminum chloride in the product. While this is true it still uses aluminum salts. The  product works very well otherwise, however. So, if you are unconcerned with aluminum in your deodorant, I would recommend this product to you.</li>
    <li> Crystal Body Deodorant is great. I guess what I like most about it is that there is no competition between my after shave and my deodorant. And it works for this guy!</li>
    <li> The only product that works on the worst bacteria. I have found nothing that works as well as this deodorant. Try it, you will like it, but you must use it for a while for it to kill the stinky bacteria.  And it is all natural with no harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have tried many deodorants and this is by far the best!</li>
    <li> It is a great product.  No scent and it works without using a bunch of  harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for years.  I like it because it does not contain aluminum and does not leave white marks on my dark clothing or yellow stains on my light clothing.</li>
    <li> It works... No white residue.</li>
    <li> Natural non-toxic mineral and it works pretty well. My mainstay.</li>
    <li> This is a great deoderant! No harmful chemicals or Aluminum.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this product is no staining or yeallo marks on your clothes</li>
    <li> I live is hot and humid weather and this deodorant provides me just the protection I need. It&#x27;s odorless and lasts me at least 4 months of daily usage.</li>
    <li> Best non-aluminum deodorant.  May have to apply more than once a day for people like me who perspire a lot.</li>
    <li> I have tried several natural deordorant. This is the best I have come across. There are some days that I need to reapply in the afternoon, but most days I can go through the entire day without ordor smell. I love that it is natural. The roll on is easy to use.</li>
    <li> The only deodorant my husband will use. I use it as well but prefer the one with Camomile as it is calming the skin after shaving.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product from Amazon for several years. It is so easily found on Amazon when order needed and I don&#x27;t have to chase around trying to find it in stores. It is also the kindest product compared with other commercial deodorants. I am happy to be able to access it easily on Amazon. thank you.</li>
    <li> Great product and price for 3 bottles!!  This deodorant works really well and is completely non-toxic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to everything else.  This works well.</li>
    <li> I used to love this -- it worked great for me (I&#x27;m not a meat eater and don&#x27;t drink often so my sweat is generally not too smelly to begin with).  But when I ordered this three-pack and began using it, I broke out in the WORST rash, so itchy it felt like mosquitos had bitten me 15 times on the armpit (weirdly it was only in my left armpit for the most part).  I&#x27;m not sure if I was shipped expired product, or if I developed an allergy, but it is bad enough that I will never use this again.</li>
    <li> The product itself works amazingly well and after a few days of use, there&#x27;s no body odor whatsoever.  I am giving this a three star because after trying the spray, I prefer it over the roll-on.</li>
    <li> This is the only natural deodorant that works for me &amp; I&#x27;ve tried tons! This is AMAZING in every way. It 100% neutralizes any odor (I&#x27;ve done lots of &#x27;tests&#x27; myself including the husband test - him getting up in my armpits (gross!) but this is the only natural deodorant he approves!). It lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your clothes &amp; won&#x27;t discolor your clothes that awful yellow like some deods. Biggest selling point is it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin (like one very popular brand that caused SO much burning, redness, irritation &amp; left dark skin that took literally a year to go away!). Some people may think they don&#x27;t want to try it because it&#x27;s unscented but after trying all kinds of scents in other brands that left me smelling worse after they mixed with sweat (ugh), this one is awesome in that it just neutralizes odor &amp; leaves me smelling like my clean self. If you want to wear other fragrances then you&#x27;re not wearing competing smells &amp; offending innocent bystanders. I&#x27;ve read so much info online about the issue of potassium alum - whether it&#x27;s safe or not, etc. I&#x27;ve read that natural potassium alum (which is what this brand is) is better than synthetic potassium alum. Also potassium alum isn&#x27;t the aluminum everyone&#x27;s worried about in commercial deodorants (even though there&#x27;s no clinical studies I could find showing 100% that aluminum causes health problems at this point). I want to avoid the other aluminums in commercial deodorants just to be safe. But after trying zillions of other natural deods without potassium alum, I&#x27;m ok with using this &amp; don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m harming myself at this point. If research comes out at some point that definitively shows it&#x27;s harmful, I&#x27;ll rethink. But at this point I really want to live my life in confidence that I&#x27;m not stanking up my surroundings &amp; disgusting myself &amp; I&#x27;m ok with this ingredient. Figure there&#x27;s way worse ingredients in commercial deodorants that I&#x27;m avoiding so I&#x27;m doing the best I can &amp; this is whatworks for me. Oh and cost! It&#x27;s so reasonably priced compared to some natural deodorants (I&#x27;ve paid WAY too much for natural deodorants &amp; none truly worked). This 3 pack is definitely the best deal I&#x27;ve seen because I&#x27;ve paid $5+ for 1 container in certain stores. I personally like the roll on because I can take it in my purse / bag &amp; apply it anywhere without wetting it (I guess you have to wet the stick version even though it lasts longer?). But I think I&#x27;m gonna get a stick version too just for home. Some people complain of it feeling a bit wet when first applied, so if you want it to dry immediately give a quick shot of air with a hair dryer or fan. But I find it dries fairly quickly even when I don&#x27;t do this.    Seriously - love this deodorant, can&#x27;t say enough great things about it &amp; HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Reduce your risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and use a natural deodorant without antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> I prefer the roll-on to the standard crystal...this stuff is great. I have been using it for years.  One word of caution, I had an issue with this order - received 2 instead of the advertised 3 product.</li>
    <li> Deoderant works very well and doesnt have all the extra chemicals and antipersperants etc.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone that wants to use a natural product and still remain fresh and dry.</li>
    <li> You still sweat, but NO odor. It is perfect for hot days or every day. The lavender smell is very mild.</li>
    <li> Good price and happy to find this product since many stores no longer stock this.</li>
</ol>
