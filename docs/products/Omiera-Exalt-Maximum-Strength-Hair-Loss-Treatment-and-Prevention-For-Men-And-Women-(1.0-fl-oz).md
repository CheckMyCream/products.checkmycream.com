    <li> I started losing hair at a young age and had very noticeable balding on the back of my head prior to using this product. As with a lot of guys my age, early hair loss was killing my confidence. I tried plenty of products that had little to no effect. In the month since I started using Exalt, new hairs have finally started to grow in. Friends and family have already started commenting on the difference it is making. Thank you for a great product and for helping restore my confidence!</li>
    <li> did not try product  [dirty bottle]</li>
    <li> I think my lashes grew over night. Small bottle but will last a long time. Used on hair, on lashes, they grew.... use a small drop every other day.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product that does what it promises. Obviously, I didn’t have a full head of luscious locks after just one application, but the growth has been much faster than I expected. I was noticing hair disappearing almost every day before I tried Exalt. Now I am seeing nothing but new hairs popping up! Don’t hesitate to purchase this.</li>
    <li> This Omiera Labs Exalt Hair loss Treatment gave my fiance the results he has been looking for. I noticed that his hair was starting to bald at the top so I was excited to use this product on him to see if it would work. I also have some hair loss issues at my hair line from getting tight corn rolls in my hair. We both used this treatment for a little over a week. By the 8th day we both could see great results. My hair line is filling back in and doesn&#x27;t look thin. His hair is filling back in as well. A little of this stuff goes a long way. I like that this product is for both men and women. The directions say you get results within a month but I guess everyone is different. If you&#x27;re looking for a way to get rid of thinning hair, you need to get this product. All of Omiera products are amazing! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Seen no improvement in hair growth.  False claims in advertisement for this product!</li>
    <li> In just one month I started to see the growth of new hair in my fore head and in 3 month many of my friends noticed the difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product, but just be sure to only use 2-3 drops as it is very concentrated&lt;br /&gt;I love it , now it has been a year my scalp is completely different. I love my better look now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very promising! I bought this as a gift for my uncle who has been complaining about his thinning hair. So far, so good. It&#x27;s a matter of applying it religiously. So excited to see the great results! Although packaging needs improvement because there were some leaks, overall product is very good!</li>
    <li> this isn&#x27;t a rating based on how well the product performed,  its a rating based on my experience.  I never got to use the product because when I received it I opened the package and was so excited to use it and the bottle was completely empty, bone dry.  So I never got to use it.  But I did receive it quickly and I was able to return it with no issue.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this item before therefore I bought it again. When my package came in the solution was leaked all over the packaging it was no use to me and I just wasted my money.</li>
    <li> This stuff works good but you get very little for the price but noticed it has gone down. have had to send back as sometime nothing in the bottle I think that a oz is a bit more than what you get. but if it hasn&#x27;t spilled out I keep it as it works good.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;DAC</li>
    <li> The bottle was empty. There was dark material around the dropper tip. I don&#x27;t know if it dried up or what happened to it. I sent it back and Amazon gave me a refund. Is there any quality control on this product at the place of manufacture? The bottle is super tiny . I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> its an effective product.</li>
    <li> Received product empty</li>
    <li> Hair loss is not an easy thing for anyone. Men and woman suffer from it all over the world. So we find ways to help us stop losing hair and regrow it. So my husband started using 1 to 2 drops of this hair loss treatment and massage it on the scalp everyday to help restore his loss of hair. Wash your hands thoroughly after applying. It is a small bottle but it brings a lot of product since you only need 1 to 2 drops a day. My husband prefers to use it at night. It is a bit greasy so it spreads easily. Make sure to massage with a bit of pressure on the scalp, as an advice from my husband, not as a doctor. My husband and I are seeing results. There are small hairs that have started growing all over different spots of his scalp. We recommend also taking some biotin to help stimulate the hair growth and help block some DHT that is one of the main reasons for hair loss. I bought this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> WOW, this product has immeasurably  &amp;#34;grown&amp;#34; my self confidence, literally. Ive been very insecure because of a lack of thickness in the hair on my head, which as a woman can be insufferable at times. The worst part of this is that it is not an easy thing to cover up and has often been a source of embarrassment that has kept me locked in my home for fear of what people would say. The Omiera Exalt have provided a solution and i have noticed hair growth and improvement on my scalp. The product has a nice smell and creamy texture that soothes my worries upon application. I feel like i have finally found a solid solution to my hair loss difficulties. I am a proud consumer of Omiera Labs Exalt and would recommend anyone going through similar struggles to try out this product.</li>
    <li> It leaked when it arrived my home!</li>
    <li> There aren’t many hair growth products out there that market to women, so I was very happy to see that this product offered directions for ladies as well. I followed the suggestion for women to dilute this half and half with water. After two months this has not only stopped me from losing more hair, but has actually produced new hair growth. I am impressed and very pleased with the progress this is helping me make against hair loss.</li>
