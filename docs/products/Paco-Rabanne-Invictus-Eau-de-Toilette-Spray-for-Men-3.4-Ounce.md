    <li> To who is my  concerns. I&#x27;m so disappointed I purchased a cologne  and I just received it and it wasn&#x27;t like I expected. It wasn&#x27;t pack the way it should be and also is incomplete is a shame the such a Good brand is not treated  as it should. Also my package wasn&#x27;t Delivery as I expected because when it was delivered to my Currie it din&#x27;t have a Receipt  so I had to wait for another proses</li>
    <li> classy ;)! very nice cologne!</li>
    <li> disappointed with this cologne, not at all as other Paco Raban&#x27;s cologne. it is like you are not wearing any cologne . I wasted my money.</li>

    <li> I first sampled this scent in a mall and had to have it but didnt want to pay the price in the mall. I had an issue with my first purchase but this vendor quickly remedied the situation. I received my package yesterday and it was packaged in a way to make sure that there would be no damage but the box was easy to get into. This merchant is first rate in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance itself is a must have for all &amp;#34;yuppies&amp;#34; in the age group of 25-40.. Its not too strong but it does have a presence that seems great at catching the positive attention of others. Its a light earth tone scent with high lights of oak and pepper. Would recommend for meetings or going out to dinner..</li>
    <li> Great deal better than over priced Macys!</li>
    <li> This cologne smells so great! Manly yet not overpowering or musky. Plus it&#x27;s got an awesome bottle.</li>
