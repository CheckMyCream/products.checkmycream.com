      <li>On the positive side, this is a very pleasantly scented shampoo--not overwhelming or headache inducing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very reasonably priced, and for what you pay I do think it&#x27;s a great value.  </li>
      <li>and it was fine, so I guess I know who will be using it up!</li>
      <li>The quality is always great, and the price is so much more affordable than higher end styling</li>
      <li>The smell does fade quickly once out of the shower, which is good.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much to get a good clean, and its light fragrance smells so good!  </li>
      <li>Most people don&#x27;t wear glasses while washing their hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this shampoo smells more like vanilla to me.  </li>
      <li>However the name is why after shampooing only once you may find you don&#x27;t need to follow it up with conditioner (although the tube indicates that for best results to follow shampooing with their conditioner).  </li>
      <li>Like most products from the Suave line</li>
      <li>I like products that can do it all without having to use more than one product.  </li>

      <li>The Morroccan infusion line is a favorite of mine</li>

      <li>Lovely scent, using this shampoo is a sensual delight.</li>
      <li>I love Suave products.</li>
      <li>i love this smell because it&#x27;s the mix of floral and shea butter, neither smell is over powering.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this product after trying the &amp;#34;Keratin Infusions&amp;#34; shampoo and loving it.  </li>
      <li>i used it already smells pretty good ty</li>
      <li>My daughter loves this, it works great and leaves her hair clean and soft and the scent is amazing.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance and it seems to wash out fairly easily.  </li>
      <li>Shampoo has a pleasant fragrance, very creamy lather, and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>I have not colored my hair for years, but the bottle does note that this is safe for color-treated hair, which is important as I would like to color it again someday soon.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice tropical scent which reminds me of Hawaii, and makes a rich, creamy lather that rinses clean.</li>
      <li>It reminds me strongly of something, but I can&#x27;t place it.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant but not overpowering scent and leaves my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This shampoo works fine.</li>
      <li>A bottle that costs a tenth of that works just fine for</li>
      <li>Such a great value.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is light and not obnoxious.</li>
      <li>shampoo has been doing a good job of keeping my hair soft post-pool, which is why I wanted it, so four stars.</li>
      <li>The smell is pretty amazing though, almost good enough to make me want to keep using it.  </li>
      <li>and I was really looking forward to trying this, but the perfume scent was very, very strong.</li>
      <li>Rich creamy texture creates rich, creamy lather.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great fragrance, rich lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price is great and it left our (family) hair clean and smelling fresh.</li>
      <li>Vanilla is OK, apples...not so much.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling light and fresh, and it&#x27;s shiny too.</li>
      <li>Hair feels very soft and was very easy to manage.  </li>
      <li>It has a lovely fragrance, lathers up well, and leaves hair easy to manage, shiny, and soft.</li>
      <li>but it gets oily super quick...</li>
      <li>: Make the word Shampoo large on the bottle because it&#x27;s easy to confuse this one with the identical-looking conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair is clean and smells fresh; soft to the touch and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>Love all Suave Professional Shampoos</li>
      <li>I would say as well as most professional products.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with the scent and how it soft it made my hair feel.</li>
      <li>She felt that her hair was clean, soft and easy to style after using the Suave Professionals product.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>Both my wife and I have fully enjoyed this product and how it leaves our hair so soft and silky.</li>
      <li>It will be another week or so until I can be certain, but this shampoo appears to weigh down my fine hair a lot more, which means more of it may be staying in my hair after I&#x27;ve rinsed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is a pretty mild flowery scent.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Moroccan Oil Shampoo, which made me interested in this one.  </li>
      <li>Suave Professional Line really leaves hair feeling great with the shampoos acting almost like conditioners.</li>
      <li>I was so happy with the shampoo and conditioner, I also purchased the macadamia nut and white orchid oil spray, it makes my hair easier to comb, leaves it feeling silkier, healthier, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine textured hair down.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is very, very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I find myself unable to use most of the really natural ones because I&#x27;m allergic to aloe, so I experiment with products trying to find one that&#x27;s good for my hair but still totally safe.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used various Suave shampoos for years and always been satisfied with them.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell like a fruit basket, but has a very pleasing and not overwhelming fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Yes, this shampoo also cleans well, and seems as though it leaves our hair feeling moist and thick, along with the great scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Here are the ingredients that are of most concern according to EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics</li>
      <li>this shampoo is OK but will not yield as healthy or manageable hair as some other hair care products that are a little more &amp;#34;spendy&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>The scent does last throughout most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those looking for a gentle shampoo.</li>
      <li>I find myself looking even more forward to washing my yard long hair than ever!</li>
      <li>I have come to the conclusion that everyone has a certain body chemistry that works well with certain kinds of shampoo, and not so well with others.  </li>
      <li>The macadamia and white orchid scent is strong, but I really like it.  </li>
      <li>However,  the results are not really anything grand.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice scent -- not too heavy. Cleans hair without leaving it greasy. I like to follow it up the conditioner.</li>
    <li> bought this together with the conditioner. i can not just use the shampoo as my hair would tangled. and i like matching smell. i love this smell because it&#x27;s the mix of floral and shea butter, neither smell is over powering. scalp feels clean and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair. bought this for the guest bathroom, but i like the smell, the feel after wash so much that i&#x27;m keep it myself.</li>
    <li> It was nice. smelled great!</li>
    <li> Love all Suave Professional Shampoos</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and a good price.</li>
    <li> Seems as if it costs a lot more!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this, it works great and leaves her hair clean and soft and the scent is amazing.</li>
    <li> good shampoo at a great price</li>
    <li> A notch up from market brand Suave shampoo.  Tried to get my husband to try it, but he is stuck on the coconut one.  I like this shampoo, but I am hooked on Nexxus.  You can use it with a change in shampoo/then conditioning treatment of your choice.  I use a harsher shampoo every so often to wash out residue from the other shampoo I have.  Nice product, but not like mine.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and long and is flat to wavy but will curl on its own if left to air dry or in rainy weather.  I expected to have to use conditioner with this moisturizing shampoo but I did not.  After lathering up and rinsing off, I found it relatively easy to pass a comb through my wet hair.  The shampoo is also very fragrant.  I have no idea what macadamia oil and white orchid smell like but this shampoo smells more like vanilla to me.  The fragrance is very, very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair also felt relatively moisturized when dry and had a little body to it.  Overall, I like this moisturizing shampoo.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I went for a shorter, wash and go hairstyle.  My only problem with this type hair style was living in a Southern Part of the US that has high humidity levels which causes my hair to be frizzy and fly-away.  I used this shampoo a couple of times before the [[ASIN:B00GTBZOVE Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid Conditioner, 12.6 Ounce]] I ordered arrived.  While my hair smelled wonderful and was softer I still needed a conditioner to bring my hair under control. I used a conditioner that I already had on hand, [[ASIN:B00HM6JLNW Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner, 12 Ounce]], and it worked okay.  When I received the [[ASIN:B00GTBZOVE Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid Conditioner, 12.6 Ounce]] and used it with this shampoo my hair was much softer and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance of this shampoo.  If you can imagine a floral scent (similar to Magnolia) with a slight almond (nut) fragrance.  It&#x27;s not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies as some fragrances, especially floral, cause me to have headaches.</li>
    <li> 5-stars because it is a great shampoo for a drug store product! I&#x27;m a bit of a shampoo snob, but grabbed this out of curiosity since I have a friend who is a hairstylist that uses sauve professionals. It smells wonderful and is very moisturizing. I have thick, dry, frizzy hair and it works well for me. I would say as well as most professional products. I actually purchased online to send to my brother who had just moved out as part of a getting started kit.</li>
    <li> On the positive side, this is a very pleasantly scented shampoo--not overwhelming or headache inducing.  It lathers nicely in the hair as well, not becoming overly soapy or needing tons to get a lather.  However,  the results are not really anything grand.  It will be another week or so until I can be certain, but this shampoo appears to weigh down my fine hair a lot more, which means more of it may be staying in my hair after I&#x27;ve rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual shampoo is also a little watery, and it&#x27;s easy to pour out too much at once and waste it if you&#x27;re not careful. (My shampoo must have leaked in shipment because their was a long line of crusted goop on the side when I received the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this will be a repeat for me--there are other shampoos that have worked better overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Bathing! ^_^ Shanshad</li>
    <li> This lathers well, smells nice, and has not caused my color to fade.  It may possibly be maintaining the color; it seems to me that my roots are not as visible!</li>
    <li> Well this Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid Shampoo has a long name doesn&#x27;t it?  However the name is why after shampooing only once you may find you don&#x27;t need to follow it up with conditioner (although the tube indicates that for best results to follow shampooing with their conditioner).  Hair feels very soft and was very easy to manage.  I like products that can do it all without having to use more than one product.  The smell is very pleasant and so my overall opinion is very favorable.  It isn&#x27;t that expensive so try it out.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my hair. I like it, but it hasn&#x27;t really won me over.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair, but moisturizing shampoo comes in handy during the summer for after I go swimming.  (I try to avoid chlorine-brittle hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Moroccan Oil Shampoo, which made me interested in this one.  The macadamia and white orchid scent is strong, but I really like it.  It reminds me strongly of something, but I can&#x27;t place it.  It&#x27;s fairly masculine, I think.  The smell does fade quickly once out of the shower, which is good.  However, people with sensitive noses might avoid this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has been doing a good job of keeping my hair soft post-pool, which is why I wanted it, so four stars.</li>
    <li> I find myself looking even more forward to washing my yard long hair than ever! Suave Professional Line really leaves hair feeling great with the shampoos acting almost like conditioners. And the smell....mmmmmm!</li>
    <li> I love Suave products. The quality is always great, and the price is so much more affordable than higher end styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Suave Professionals does a great job of moisturizing my daughter&#x27;s hair. Her hair tends to be dry and frizzy. The Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and Whit Orchid shampoo helps to tame the frizz by moisturizing her hair. It smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love the whole family of Suave products and this Professionals shampoo is a great addition to the Suave family.</li>
    <li> If you want a moisturizing shampoo that will leave your hair soft and silky, without making it flat, then you will want to try Suave’s Macademia Oil and White Orchid shampoo. I have thick, course hair and it works for me even without using the conditioner. It also has a nice tropical scent which reminds me of Hawaii, and makes a rich, creamy lather that rinses clean.</li>
    <li> This is labeled as a moisturizing shampoo that Suave recommends following up with their conditioner. I prefer using a CLEANING shampoo and letting the conditioner moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural, hmmmm: Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Dimethiconol, Glycerin, Carbomer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, TEA-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, Citric Acid, PPG-9, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, PEG-45M, , Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Water &amp; Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil &amp; Phalaenopsis Amabilis Extract were the only natural ingredients I spotted.</li>
    <li> For a mass-market shampoo, Suave usually manages to do the job well enough, and this particular variety is no exception. It has a lovely fragrance, lathers up well, and leaves hair easy to manage, shiny, and soft. Suave is a dependable brand and I have never had any problems with any of their products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use Suave but I figured I would try this one since it seemed a step above their &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; low cost shampoo.  I was sorely disappointed. I have long, straight, blonde and dry hair but it gets oily super quick... and this one just made it a frizzy mess.  No way will I use it on my hair again.  I did use it on my 4 year old daughter who has super silky hair naturally and it was fine, so I guess I know who will be using it up!</li>
    <li> Decent for what it is, but Suave products have never been impressive and continue not to be. They are priced low for a reason. My wife doesn&#x27;t care for this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that shampoos get their share of five star reviews and one star reviews.  I have come to the conclusion that everyone has a certain body chemistry that works well with certain kinds of shampoo, and not so well with others.  Having said that, this shampoo seems like a very nice one for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like the scent and the way it lathers in use.  We absolutely love how thick and rich the shampoo feels.  Indeed, our regular shampoo almost feels watery in comparison.  Yes, this shampoo also cleans well, and seems as though it leaves our hair feeling moist and thick, along with the great scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may almost feel as though you are at an expensive tropical spa when you use this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> My hair is so soft and it seems to work just as good as my expensive shampoo. I like to change up my shampoo and conditioner once in awhile and to get different treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind I live in Florida and this really does seem to help with the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I also bought the conditioner I believe in not splitting up the set and I am really really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside I&#x27;m NOT too happy about the smell until it dries or maybe I get use to it. The Black Raspberry + White Tea Shampoo &amp; Conditioner seems to smell better but doesn&#x27;t help with frizz. (I love in Florida)</li>
    <li> Lovely scent, using this shampoo is a sensual delight. The shampoo provides a high level of moisturization, which makes my hair look smoother, and feel softer. I have not colored my hair for years, but the bottle does note that this is safe for color-treated hair, which is important as I would like to color it again someday soon. If you&#x27;re looking for a shampoo that will delight your senses while it moisturizes your hair, look no farther.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this new \\&quot;Professionals\\&quot; Suave shampoo a try.  I&#x27;ve used various Suave shampoos for years and always been satisfied with them.  As a male with short hair, I&#x27;m not too concerned with spending $40 a bottle on my shampoos.  A bottle that costs a tenth of that works just fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: I do like that the Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid Shampoo thoroughly cleans my hair without leaving it too moisturized, resulting in greasy-looking or flat hair.  While my hair is short, I do like a little substance to it, which moisturizing shampoos don&#x27;t allow.  This particular shampoo also lathers extremely well, which makes me think it&#x27;s really doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The scent is a pretty mild flowery scent.  It&#x27;s not overpowering, but it&#x27;s not what I typically like my washed hair to smell like.  It&#x27;s just \\&quot;okay.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this for me is a great product and works well for my hair, I probably wouldn&#x27;t get it again because of the scent.  I&#x27;d rather use one of the many other scents that Suave offers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start with the practical aspects of this product and then get down to the possible hazards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used with Suave&#x27;s matching conditioner, this shampoo leaves my hair manageable. However, when I left out the conditioner, the shampoo left my hair stringy-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and not obnoxious. I prefer unscented products because I have allergies, but this fragrance did not seem to cause problems (unless I&#x27;m wrong about my itchy eyes being irritated by the pollen of nearby trees - I suppose it could be due to this product; too soon to say).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a suggestion for Suave: Make the word Shampoo large on the bottle because it&#x27;s easy to confuse this one with the identical-looking conditioner. Most people don&#x27;t wear glasses while washing their hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the negative chemical stuff: Like the conditioner, the shampoo contains some undesirable chemicals. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the word &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; -- it&#x27;s hype! Here are the ingredients that are of most concern according to EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database:&lt;br /&gt;1. DMDM HYDANTOIN (FORMALDEHYDE RELEASER) - an irritant, and not good for the aldehyde-sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;2. METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE - Neurotoxic and an irritant&lt;br /&gt;3. METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE - Possible carcinogen, allergen, and a stressor on the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, most hair products contain stuff that&#x27;s bad for you or the environment. I find myself unable to use most of the really natural ones because I&#x27;m allergic to aloe, so I experiment with products trying to find one that&#x27;s good for my hair but still totally safe. I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
    <li> Rich creamy texture creates rich, creamy lather. My hair is clean and smells fresh; soft to the touch and healthy looking. It also makes my color longer lasting, which matters to those of us in particular who like to cover the gray. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product after trying the &amp;#34;Keratin Infusions&amp;#34; shampoo and loving it.  I am a total snob about hair products--I usually use the really expensive brands, and the only reason I was willing to try this was the claim that it was comparable to Pureology, which I love.  This product has a great smell but makes my hair feel dry, tangly, and frankly just not very clean.  The smell is pretty amazing though, almost good enough to make me want to keep using it.  Try the &amp;#34;Keratin Infusions&amp;#34; shampoo from Suave Professionals; it is much better!  It actually lives up to the claims.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells great.</li>
    <li> I was using a salon brand that is 3x the price and I got a sample of this in the mail. I fell in love with the scent and how it soft it made my hair feel. The shampoo does an amazing job of cleansing without stripping and smells unbelievable and the conditioner actually detangles my hair. My hair feels silky, healthy, and looks shiny. I was so happy with the shampoo and conditioner, I also purchased the macadamia nut and white orchid oil spray, it makes my hair easier to comb, leaves it feeling silkier, healthier, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine textured hair down. These products are now part of my permanent haircare regimen and they all together probably cost the same amount as one salon brand shampoo bottle. Such a great value.</li>
    <li> The best product I ever used!</li>
    <li> This stuff saved my hair. I just dyed my hair at home so my hair has been very dry. I was about ready to go get a hair cut to cut my ends off, but after one use with this shampoo and conditioner combination, my hair was silky and soft. It also smells really good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the kind of person that likes all of the fruity fragrances that are in a lot of shampoos these days.  Vanilla is OK, apples...not so much.  I generally like to smell the shampoo before I buy it, but since I ordered it online I didn&#x27;t have that experience prior to receiving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell like a fruit basket, but has a very pleasing and not overwhelming fragrance.  I also really like that it doesn&#x27;t have any parabans or dyes...I just wish that Suave would have taken it one step further and also made the shampoo without sulfates.  I had a shampoo that was sulfate free, as well as paraben and dye free and loved my hair when I used it.  Unfortunately, it was also fairly expensive so I decide to try this new Suave Professionals line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does feel soft, though I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is much frizzier from using this shampoo.  Part of that may be that I am not using the companion conditioner (my previous shampoo was a shampoo/conditioner so I didn&#x27;t have any on hand) I love the fragrance and it seems to wash out fairly easily.  I have a lot of hair so sometimes that&#x27;s a problem for me and if doesn&#x27;t all rinse out then it can leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end.  It&#x27;s a shampoo.  It&#x27;s very reasonably priced, and for what you pay I do think it&#x27;s a great value.  It does it&#x27;s job, smells really nice, but I miss my other shampoo terribly.  So while it does have a lot of positives about it, I will be going back to my more expensive paraben, sulfate and dye free shampoo.  I don&#x27;t regret giving it a go though.  If you are on the fence about it I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> This was a good shampoo.  The price is great and it left our (family) hair clean and smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works fine. It has a pleasant but not overpowering scent and leaves my hair very soft and smooth. I was unhappy by how &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; the ingredients were though - - very heavy on the chemicals for a shampoo with the word natural in the title. It makes me feel like it&#x27;s trying to deceive the consumer.</li>
    <li> Shampoo has a pleasant fragrance, very creamy lather, and is easy to use. The product will serve for months as it does not take much to do a great job of cleaning and conditioning hair.  The manufacturer claims the product has ten times the conditioner of other shampoos and testing by a female user indicates that this may well be the case.  She felt that her hair was clean, soft and easy to style after using the Suave Professionals product.</li>
    <li> I have normal hair. Sometimes I need just a pop of moisture because of the winter cold or the summer sun. When I tried this shampoo with the accompanying conditioner, my hair appeared substantially weighed down. However, since I feel this is actually a product that could rescue damaged/dry hair, I am leaving it in the four-star range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great fragrance, rich lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair needs a serious boost of moisture, this might be a nice, inexpensive cure.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much to get a good clean, and its light fragrance smells so good!  Leaves my hair feeling light and fresh, and it&#x27;s shiny too.</li>
    <li> Like most products from the Suave line this shampoo is OK but will not yield as healthy or manageable hair as some other hair care products that are a little more &amp;#34;spendy&amp;#34;.  I personally prefer the still moderately priced Clear brand or the high quality but relatively expensive TONI &amp; GUY line of products.</li>
    <li> While I love the smell and luxurious feel of Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid Shampoo, it leaves my curly hair flat. And while somedays I might want to flatten my hair, most days I want my curls. So, I can only give this product 3 stars for that reason. However, if you don&#x27;t have curly hair, this would be a great treatment as it does leave hair silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I should begin by saying that I am an enormous fan of the &amp;#34;infusion&amp;#34; line by Suave. The Morroccan infusion line is a favorite of mine and I was really looking forward to trying this, but the perfume scent was very, very strong. What was worse was that it lingered the next day. I only wash my hair every other day and when I got it wet and conditioned it, the strong perfume scent re-asserted itself. I was also disappointed to find that this left my head feeling itchy the next day (I wash at night). I guess it&#x27;s just not playing well with my body chemistry. Usually, Suave&#x27;s shampoo works a dream for me, but this one did not.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful shampoo and fragrance. Both my wife and I have fully enjoyed this product and how it leaves our hair so soft and silky. It has a rich lather with such a small amount of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;We will definitely be buying more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> This particular shampoo from Suave is very similar to their other shampoos that are similarly packaged in the gold bottles.  It gently cleanses the hair without stripping it and leaves the hair soft and silky.  However, if your scalp is extra oily or sweaty from an outdoor activity or from working out, a repeat wash is needed.  The scent is a light floral with sandalwood-like base tone.  The scent does last throughout most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those looking for a gentle shampoo.</li>
    <li> Good i used it already smells pretty good ty</li>
