<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Smells Great, the pricing is better than buying it in the mall, wanting 90$ for a 20$ cologne. love the smell and will get you girls hehehe. enjoy it</li>
    <li> This cologne has a good fresh smell I have received several compliments when wearing it great everyday  projection is average not over bearing buy it you &#x27;ll like it</li>
    <li> This fragrance is an amazing value! It reminds me of Fierce, by Abercrombie and Fitch. Great cologne and lasts most of the day. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I originally \\&quot;passed\\&quot; on this cologne, because I had a specific brand in mind while purchasing a replacement bottle of cologne, a few months ago. I definitely thought it smelled great, however... But the next time I purchased more cologne, I smelled Sun Java again, and I remembered how great it smelled upon my original experience, months earlier, and bought it this time.    All of the descriptions of this cologne speak of \\&quot;Top notes include Grapefruit, Lemon, Mandarin orange, Nutmeg, and Tarragon. Middle notes consist of lavender, cedar, and white musk with base notes of musk and vanilla\\&quot;, but unless you are a professional reviewer, you may not notice all of these individual \\&quot;pieces\\&quot; of the total picture....    What this fragrance IS about, is the OVERALL smell.  It&#x27;s one where people can&#x27;t quite \\&quot;put their finger on it\\&quot; as to what it is, but EVERYONE just notices how GREAT it smells, without ever being too over-bearing to the senses.    I have been in a room, where several people say \\&quot;someone just smells really good\\&quot;, but can&#x27;t identify who or what it actually is that smells so great.      One person said \\&quot;I&#x27;m going to just follow you around all day because you smell so good\\&quot;.  Speaking of \\&quot;All Day\\&quot;, this fragrance has \\&quot;staying power\\&quot;, to last throughout the whole day, so when it settles down, you are left with a great, fresh smell, which just seems to brighten everyone&#x27;s day, as well as the wearer&#x27;s.    I am definitely not a professional fragrance reviewer (PFR?), but I can tell you that for the price, this CANNOT BE BEAT!  I have paid much, much more for other fragrances which simply dont last as long or smell as great as this subtle gem.    Definitely will purchase again, and highly recommend to anyone looking for something that the whole world isnt wearing!</li>
    <li> It smells like Tiamo and I love Tiamo. I am not great or even good at describing scents but it&#x27;s a sweet scent.</li>
    <li> Since I was presented to this perfume 5 years go I never bought another fragrance. The aroma is very smooth and nice.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites!!!! Inexpensive and smells great! I love this cologne and buy it frequently!!! Everyone say i smell great when i wear it!</li>
    <li> OMG ! my choir teacher came to school with this on and it smelled SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOODD ! my qod it makes you wanna just melt ! i used to have some perfume that smelled just like this and i cant think of the name ! but its so similar im qonna order me some !</li>
    <li> Wonderfully fresh and uplifting fragrance at an amazing price!  Would expect to pay much more for this quality, long-lasting colonge.  Great transaction and fast shipping.  Can&#x27;t stop sniffing this gem (:--))</li>
    <li> Smells a little to weird on my skin..</li>
    <li> I love rhis cologne. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cologne for my husband! It is unique and we both think it&#x27;s a great price for how long it lasts and how wonderful it smells.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in the mall for triple the amount that I paid on amazon. My husband loved it as soon as he smelled it. I love it on him also. So once he ran out, I had to purchase it again. At first I was a little afraid  that it wouldn&#x27;t smell the same, but it does. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne.</li>
    <li> I went out on a limb and purchased this cologne while looking for a replacement. I read reviews all over the internet and loved the descriptions. I was extremely hesitant because I have never purchased a cologne without first smelling it or wearing it for a day... but WOW! This stuff will blow your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best description I can give is a blend of vanilla, banana, and cloves with an undertone of mint. I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible for anyone not to like this, so if you&#x27;re like me and not sure if you want it... just get it. It&#x27;s only 20 bucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh, and girls seem to LOVE it. I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments before.)</li>
    <li> If u try to buy this one, have a second tought, I bought it and didn&#x27;t like it, instead of this one buy Boss No 6 or Thallium blue or sport, they smell better. U may think why these, well the aroma is close, but the other 3 outperforms Sun Java. And if u get them from Amazon and I mean amazon u can buy them for 16 bucks each. Overall it&#x27;s a good cologne but the ones I told u are better</li>
    <li> I thing this was way to sweet and it smelled like something a girl would put on. So for me it did not work. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Not the same smell as my other cologne which i got from a department store.  I don&#x27;t want to think it&#x27;s fake but it might be.</li>
    <li> Originally I bought this at the mall for about $80 bucks &amp; was blown away by how good it smells! Went on Amazon an saw it for this amazingly low price and i was kinda bummed out about that because the store doesnt allow any refunds. So from now on in gonna smell the fragrances at the mall first then buy them on Amazon lol ;)</li>
    <li> This fragrance has now become one of my top 3 favourite ones. I now use it on a daily basis, mainly because it is so much cheaper than my other favourite fragrances (Bulgari and D&#x27;Issey Miyake), but also because it has a lovely, subtle aroma, that is not overpowering, but is very distinctive and sweet without being too feminine. Since I started using it, I have had many flattering comments from women on how lovely I smell! My wife doesn&#x27;t seem to be too impressed though...</li>
    <li> When I wear this I have girls get close and breathe me in and tell me how I smell so good. No other Cologne can match this Sun Java Perfection.</li>
    <li> One of my Co Wokers put me on to this Colonge. He came in bragging how he got a deal on the Colonge at the local mall. He bought this same Colonge at the mall on \\&quot;SALE\\&quot; for $40, Being the Amazon Head that i am, after smelling it i immediatly jumped on Amazon and found the SAME size colonge for $22 Shipped, He didn&#x27;t like that to much.I had never heard of this Colonge until he brought it to my attention, let me tell you I love colonge an have an extensive high end collection, This is one of the Freshest Cleanest smelling colonges i now own, and it last the entire day, recived many compliments on it. would definetly recomend it to any one.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend ran out of this cologne and I found it on Amazon for a lot less than what my boyfriend originally paid!  I love the way this cologne smells! Its a sexy and fresh scent.</li>
    <li> Pure epicness kinda brings out the social and bold side of a person I was at lè mall going through the boss and million colognes all of them were ethier to strong or smell like old folks. This one is more of a classic suit smell with fire bieng wearing it  weilding an ice sword it&#x27;s intense but in a way that attracts attention sometimes to much attention but super long lasting.its a only wear on special occasion baises basically.  Also fruity but in a way again that attracts attention.</li>
    <li> I purchase Sun Java White for Men because I heard it smell so much like another cologne that I really like.  So I read the reviews on this one, and took a chance on this also.  I was pleasantly surprised how nice this cologne is, you really can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.  I would say its ideal for the fall and winter .  It last about 6 hrs. plus. Sun Java White is very nice too.</li>
    <li> not sure about the hype. Very very generic and synthetic smelling. Smells the same from when you spray it until when it disappears.jsut okay</li>
    <li> This item smells fantastic and it last all day long. I am very pleased with the total purchasing experience and highly recommend this item to the fellas that may read this review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect for the amount of cologne you get</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected and prompt in delivery</li>
    <li> I really like this cologne. You don&#x27;t really need too much. Just a couple of sprays behind the ears and you&#x27;re set.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells soooo good!!! I attack my man when he wears this!! Love it!! I def recommend purchasing this cologne!!</li>
    <li> Great experience, no cmplaints</li>
    <li> Amazing scent, this is a day time cologne but very fresh and clean. Great price and shipping.</li>
    <li> Product is mostly alcohol judging by the feel, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t even last for an hour, confirmed by my wife. Smells great when first applied, just doesn&#x27;t last must be fake.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my Bf and he loves it! So do I :)</li>
    <li> Has a very unique sent that stands out. It last for around 7 hours on my skin. It&#x27;s sure to get you noticed and not in a bad way. Even though I&#x27;d say its bold it doesn&#x27;t do it in an obnoxious way. The case can be made that it can be for both night and day. I&#x27;d say its defiantly a romantic sent. Hey at this price what are you waiting for!</li>
    <li> SUN java is one of the best cologne ever had in my life. I have many of colognes; but since I buought  Sun java,I had to stop using others. I wear Sun java everyday and everyday at work and school people give me a  good compliment about this cologne.Finally,I highly recommend this cologne to everyone who  needs to wear a good stuff.</li>
    <li> Family bought this for me. While I think it smells very sweet and on the feminine side, I still use it. One thing that I really like about this Cologne, is that it will last all day. Literally.. I work in a kitchen where I sweat, the smells of food around me, smoke being blown at me from the grills.. Even after 7-8 hours of all that.. You can still smell the Cologne.</li>
    <li> this cologne smells amazing, my brother has the white bottle, which also smells great. it has a strong masculine scent but not overpowering. i cannot wait to wear it out to see the reaction i get from it!</li>
    <li> I will re-iterate what others have said about Sun Java in previous reviews... i was at the mall about to purchase a replacement for one of my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; colognes and the fragrance clerk suggested Sun Java and said she loved it.  At first i was thinking it was a ploy just to get me to buy it, but then she sprayed it and i was pleasanly surprised since it was not over bearing and it really did SMELL good. So just to be on the safe side i asked her about a few others just to be sure she wasn&#x27;t BSing me and i was satisfied that she was giving honest responses... so when it was said and done i purchased it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later that night i wore it out to a function and, this is no exageration, i got multiple compliments and a whole lots of \\&quot;Goooood you smell soooo good... what is that you&#x27;re wearing??\\&quot; lol I guess it really works with my body chemistry... and as one previous reviewer said, it does last throughtout the day... So fellas, this is a steal on Amazon... Dont be the last to wear it... it&#x27;s relatively unknown and you&#x27;ll have the ultimate ice breaker without saying a word!</li>
    <li> Magnificent smell! Reminds me of the discontinued scent magnetism by escada. Anytime i wear this women and men want to know what I&#x27;m wearing. You will not be disappointed. Its a sweet heavy fall scent. All of Franc Oliver scents are spot on, but this one is by far his best</li>
    <li> I love this spray.. so does the many I&#x27;ve came it contact with.. Very good stuff.. A must buy Item..</li>
    <li> I found this stuff in a mall in chicago years ago and haven&#x27;t  seen or heard of it since. This stuff smelled amazing and we even nicknamed it &amp;#34;sex in a bottle.&amp;#34; But after i left Chicago i forgot about it, that was 4 years ago. Just the other night i heard the word Frank and reminded me of it so i came on here to see if it even still existed and it did! So i bought it, for a quarter of the price that i did in a mall years ago. Just letting you know, this is a day time cologne. This smell has no depth or darkness too it if you get what i mean, it&#x27;s hard to explain. Smelling this on me at night.. is just off, smells great!.. just doesnt fit the night time bar/club feel.but that&#x27;s just me</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Unique and inexpensive</li>
    <li> I love my husband in this cologne and he gets a lot of compliments especially from other women. Nothing like a good smelling husband</li>
    <li> Surprisingly nice, yet not pricey.</li>
    <li> it is a wonderfull scent</li>
    <li> Great product. .Thanks</li>
    <li> Some guy in a fragrance store in a mall turned me on to this. He wanted $50. I talked him down to $35. It was definitely worth $50. Got it in amazon for $20. Life is good. I wear it all the time and my wife cant keep her hands off me!</li>
    <li> If only the scent was a little stronger, it would&#x27;ve been perfect.</li>
    <li> Smell good , I like it !!!!</li>
    <li> Long lasting scent and reasonably priced, compared to colognes you find in department stores. I would have given it five stars, except the fact that I also bought Thallium Black for Men by Yves De Sistelle which I like even better.</li>
    <li> terrific cologne, long lasting mellow scent, wife loved it, so did i. much more than expected, bot based on reviews.</li>
    <li> I totally love this cologne. I love its projection, scent and longevity. I would give it more stars but 5 is max. The amount of compliments I get from both men and women is unbelievable. I&#x27;d recommend this cologne to anyone in the market looking for something new and affordable. 10 stars in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My friend went crazy when he opened it. He loves it so much! I will have to do more shopping for the holidays</li>
    <li> Received item as described and for a lot less then a retail store.  This fresh smelling cologne is idea for after a shower and around the house. I would recommend this product to other family and friends.</li>
    <li> Crisp and fresh. very well recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought my fiance&#x27; this as a random gift and he fell in love with it instantly. He gets compliments every day he wears it from nearly everyone around him. Best dollar I&#x27;ve ever spent! (:</li>
    <li> It was fast delivery and i love the smell</li>
    <li> I love this cologne!  I used to always wear polo blue and this is my new go-to.  Plus the price is way better!!!</li>
    <li> Really hated the smell at first because it is very strong at first and stings my nose.  But after 3 or 4 uses ( I wanted to like it because of the great reviews), I really enjoy it now.  The key for me was not to concentrate the spray in one small area but to spray on an overall area.  So now I really enjoy it (not because self fulfilling prophecy).  It is strong and not the flowery type.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time as promised with a great price.</li>
    <li> smells really good and last long</li>
    <li> This perfume is the best ever</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Very sweet smelling,</li>
    <li> I have used it prior - it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love to wear this because of it&#x27;s fresh clean scent</li>
    <li> I love it... Definitely exceeds my expectations.. I used to use A&amp;f perfumes but this is equally good..it&#x27;s lasting for hours..</li>
    <li> Gave me the wrong item... but quick and easy exchange. satisfied.</li>
    <li> Was exactly as advertised. Fast Delivery! Thanks.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s what i expected......i love its smell.....manly.....but again, like others, doesn&#x27;t last long .....but i love using it... I recommend it to others ....</li>
    <li> Is so good and sweet as the best!! one of the best !! last enough for all day!!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and have now bought it twice and i still love it. get a lot of compliments in my day</li>
    <li> So this is my boyfriends favorite cologne, he used it before we met but his bottle broke and he never replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;I had never smelled this before i ordered it but I got it for him, for our 3 year anniversary, of course I had to open it to see how it smelled, lol.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I am VERY happy I got this for him, it smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty subtle, so it&#x27;s not to harsh or over powering for the sense&#x27;s, and I know hat you are probably thinking.&lt;br /&gt;Subtle colognes usually don&#x27;t last long, you gotta put it one multiple times daily just to smell it, well that is NOT the case with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it on a piece of paper the moment it arrived to smell it, over 24 hours have passed and it still smells like the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;As for the shipping, very fast shipping and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered the 9th, shipped on the 9th (with free super saver shipping might I add) and was delivered on the 13th.&lt;br /&gt;It was actually DELIVERED one day before the estimated SHIPPING day.</li>
    <li> Hard to find anywhere retail locally.  Excellent casual fragrance for work or play.  Love the long lasting scent.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. My husband loves it and the price is the best I have seen</li>
    <li> I really love this fragrance!! You only need to spray a small amount on you and it will last all day!!! The  sun java for women smell very very good also.</li>
