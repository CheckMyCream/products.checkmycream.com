      <li>I love this oil.</li>
      <li>Castor oil have many purposes,I purchased it a while ago</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great, but making a 50/50 oil mixture with this has really done wonders for my hair.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this many times and never had a problem.  </li>
      <li>Love .</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I use this to cleanse my face with avocado oil and/or jojoba oil and it has cleared most of my blackheads.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t care about that sort of thing, then get the Now brand http://amzn.to/1uCed7Q, but in the end this is better and it ends up being cheaper too.  </li>
      <li>I love this oil,leaves my face smooth.</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t realize it would be so much, but that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
      <li>This castor oil is fine, but it started growing something in the bottom</li>
      <li>It can leave hair super oily which is okay</li>
      <li>this oil works wonders and works best if you heat it up in the microwave a little before use</li>
      <li>After using the oil I noticed a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I plan to primarily use this on my hair and skin.</li>
      <li>Now Instead of cowashing I use a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is by far superior.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff and still have a good amount left!</li>
      <li>for ezcema on hands and many other maladies this works great ..</li>
      <li>My skin is so happy now in this dry winter weather.</li>

      <li>The item came packed very well, no leakage as others have reported, and I did not get the sense that the bottle was cheap or not durable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to have success using it in conjunction with KMF gel.</li>
      <li>Some oil did leak into the box (inconsequential - absorbed by cardboard).  </li>
      <li>I have used it for about 1 week and have noticed my face more soft glowing and dewy.</li>
      <li>It is fresh</li>
      <li>And the price is right.</li>
      <li>, it makes my hair feel soft and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>The shipping was super fast.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s seriously just the most amazing and versatile product I have.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently using KCCC and have been for three years, so thought I would give this a try to see if it was more moisturizing and if it would leave my hair softer.</li>
      <li>pretty soon after I started using it.</li>

      <li>thanks a lot!</li>
      <li>I have not noticed much thickness in my hair because I have not been consistent and using it, but we shall see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I noticed with this it calmed it down and gave my skin a nice glow.</li>
      <li>Who knows if it actually helps them grow longer, but they remain conditioned and strong and I attribute it to this oil.</li>
      <li>Large bottle just started waiting now to see results</li>
      <li>they have lengthened but they have not thickened as much as I like...</li>
      <li>This is an absolute must have for my house..</li>
      <li>I did use it for 3 weeks straight</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What can I say about this castor oil?  It is good quality. I&#x27;ve bought this many times and never had a problem.  And it is a stable oil in that it does not get rancid like say hemp oil or almond oil, at least it never has for me.  And you don&#x27;t need to store it in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I like this brand because it is hexane free and cold pressed.  If you don&#x27;t care about that sort of thing, then get the Now brand http://amzn.to/1uCed7Q, but in the end this is better and it ends up being cheaper too.  So, it just makes more sense to buy this brand, don&#x27;t you think?</li>
    <li> fast shipping.  good price</li>
    <li> The processes of ordering and receipt were without issue, and the product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> First purchase of castor oil.  I am using it on my hair (Caucasian), face and décolleté.  Apparently it reduces wrinkles, scars and acne in addition to many other uses.  I am excited to see if it helps the S. Dermatitis on my face (nothing says it will, but with myriad other uses, one can hope).      The oil is everything one would expect.  The shipping was not.  Item arrived via USPS.  There was very little packing in the box which resulted in a broken cap.  Some oil did leak into the box (inconsequential - absorbed by cardboard).  Good thing I had a spare cap from a different product.  Otherwise this item from this seller would get a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I was buying the generic castor oil in the store and then switched to Heritage Castor Oil through Amazon.  I&#x27;m impressed!  This is very good oil and I like that it is hexane-free.  I use it to cleanse my face (the oil cleansing method) and my skin looks clearer and softer.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> Amazing and lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my wavy hair for flyaways and frizz. I use it on my eyebrows, eyelashes, face and for rashes. I also use it with essential oils because of its ability to pull things into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Barely any smell and not too sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll get a chest pain and go rub some castor oil on the spot and it&#x27;s gone literally in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have a sore muscle and rub some on and bam the pain is gone in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had a terrible terrible cystic acne break out from a new foundation I used.. so twice a day I washed my face with peppermint soap and then put a medium thick layer of castor oil over the affected area and the cystic acne disappeared literally overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as diaper rash cream for my step babies and it&#x27;s seriously just the most amazing and versatile product I have. This is an absolute must have for my house..if I don&#x27;t have my castor oil, fits are thrown lol</li>
    <li> I have read so much about this product and I am not dissappointed. The product is high quality, and it is so useful for so many things. I recomend the product and the seller. My item arrived fast and it was as promised. I love it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 2 months now and so far the results are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin- by washing your face and then putting a warm rag/cloth on your face for a few minutes and then gently rubbing a LITTLE bit of this Castor Oil all over your face.. it will definitely help to clear up acne. It is not a miracle worker, but if you give it time and don&#x27;t use too much it will improve the look of your skin (hopefully) it did for me. I am on BC so my face is always breaking out because of the hormones, but I noticed with this it calmed it down and gave my skin a nice glow. BEWARE: since Castor oil promotes hair growth give your skin a break so you don&#x27;t grow a beard or just use some hair removing stuff.&lt;&lt; apparently it wasn&#x27;t clear this was an exaggeration and you will not literally grow a beard&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I also rub Castor oil on the bottom of my feet before going to bed. I have never used anything that made my feet this soft! It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair- I heat a small amount of this up and then rub it through my hair trying to get to the roots and then put a shower cap on and let it sit for about 15 minutes before I take a shower and shampoo and condition like normal. It has made my hair extremely soft and shiny! I have not noticed much thickness in my hair because I have not been consistent and using it, but we shall see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It has been great for eyebrows! I put a little on at night and sometimes during the day if I am not going anywhere. I have noticed it has helped to regrow some hair where it has been a little thin from over plucking/threading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product! It has many uses the key is consistency and a little of it goes a LONG way!</li>
    <li> Castor oil have many purposes,I purchased it a while ago and it&#x27;s still lasting. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> The problem I have is the smell and it is sticky, but it does work effectively. I would reccommend diluting it with water and applying it every to see results faster.</li>
    <li> My wife used this product to help her eye lashes grow faster and longer. It worked wonderfully. Also she uses it to wash her face, it has helped cut down on her blemishes on her skin and has made it very clear. She also used it on my bad shoulders and after about a week of massaging the oil into my muscle and tendons, it helped cut down on my inflammation and pain a good amount.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s  wonderful, it makes my hair feel soft and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. my nails are thicker and my skin looks nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a natural sun screen at the recommendation of a friend. So far it seems to be working. It&#x27;s a thick oil has a slight odor which goes away after 30 minutes or so after applying.</li>
    <li> I bought eye brow growth enhancer stuff before and it didn&#x27;t do anything to my eyebrows. I used this castor oil for the past 5 days and my eye brows is definitely longer. I plucked my eyebrows when I was younger (it was a trend back then...) and I just hope this can help me regain my old bushy eyebrows.</li>
    <li> The item came packed very well, no leakage as others have reported, and I did not get the sense that the bottle was cheap or not durable.In fact it was the opposite. I already use Jamaican Black Castor Oil as part of my hair regimen, and it&#x27;s also great on my skin, so I imagine this stuff works the same way, just doesn&#x27;t have the other raw ingredients that JBCO has, but you still get the same results. I plan to start using this product once my JBCO has officially run out. It&#x27;s a 4oz bottle and so far I have had that bottle for early two months, and not even half of it is gone yet. So I imagine that a 16oz bottle of this stuff will last me for at least 6months to a year. I apply JBCO to my hair about 3x a week, so I plan to do the same with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did at least use some of this on my feet once I got out the shower, and it definitely does help with dryness, so that&#x27;s definitely good. I have heard this can be ingested for other uses, and used for packs, and things like that. I plan to primarily use this on my hair and skin. Based on my experience, you don&#x27;t need much of this stuff to get it working. A little goes a long way. I can put about the size of a quarter in my palm, and that&#x27;s enough for all my hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the value, I feel this was a great deal. Less than $10 got me a 16oz bottle, and the 16oz bottle is already overwhelming, I didn&#x27;t realize it would be so much, but that&#x27;s a good thing. I paid close to $9 for the 4oz of JBCO. Granted it&#x27;s an organic product and all, but still, it&#x27;s 4oz. Although the 4oz goes a long way, I am excited that this 16oz bottle will go an even longer ways. I can&#x27;t stress this enough: A little goes a long way! Don&#x27;t use too much at a time on your hair. It is a heavy oil. it is why I only use it 3x a week. On all other days, I use Extra Virgin Olive Oil or Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy, thick hair, and to help with speeding up the growth of your hair. It&#x27;s not a change that will happen overnight, but the long-term results are definitely great.to help with speeding up the growth of your hair. It&#x27;s not a change that will happen overnight, but the long-term results are definitely great.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! It has so many purposes! I use it as a hair mask before washing my hair and put a little on an eyelash wand and just put it on my lashes before going to bed. I had eyelash extensions and it completely destroyed my eyelashes. After using the oil I noticed a huge difference.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that I think could put moisturizing cream companies out of business. It is so good for the hair and skin and just feels wonderful when you put it on. I put it on in the shower and rinse it off and find it never leaves my skin greasy. It can leave hair super oily which is okay sometimes but if I want a dryer look which is most of the time I use conditioner to remove the oil then rinse it out. The perfect combo. And the price is right.</li>
    <li> Heard rave reviews by ladies who said using this in combination with KMF gel worked a miracle on their 4a hair. I&#x27;m currently using KCCC and have been for three years, so thought I would give this a try to see if it was more moisturizing and if it would leave my hair softer. If you&#x27;re buying this for your hair, then I suggest you use a very thick with lots of slip leave-in conditioner underneath, otherwise the castor oil will not penetrate your hair. I&#x27;ve yet to have success using it in conjunction with KMF gel. It sits on top of my hair and makes it hard to work with. My hair dried very crunchy and no moisture was retained. I will continue to experiment with ways to use this and minimize using products that don&#x27;t have all natural ingredients, but no luck so far. BUT I am now using it as a moisturizer for my face at night, and WOW it&#x27;s great. Make sure your face is still damp and apply just a little. The next morning your face will be soft, smooth, beautiful. I&#x27;ve even been using it to treat a small patch of eczema and it has since cleared. I have very very sensitive skin to the point where I just use coconut milk and oatmeal soap (from a local soap maker) to gently cleanse, give myself a facial once a week with a combination of french green clay, aloe and water and then follow up with castor oil or coconut oil as a moisturizer. Kiehls, Aveeno, Dove, etc have all changed their formula and I can no longer use them. I have hormonal skin, but I find that doing those things described above leaves me breakout free and skin so soft. Love it.</li>
    <li> No odor which I like.</li>
    <li> big bottle...long lasting. great for hair growth, my lashes, and eyebrows.  Castor oil is my go to beauty oil. great price and arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> great product/overall purchase experience, it met met my expectations :-)</li>
    <li> So good!! I put this in an empty mascara container that I got online here and use the castor oil on my lashes and brows. They have gotten thicker, healthier and my lashes are longer!</li>
    <li> My favorite castor oil</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It really does moisterize not only my hair, but skin too.</li>
    <li> I use this to cleanse my face with avocado oil and/or jojoba oil and it has cleared most of my blackheads. Good amount of product that will last me a while.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and still have a good amount left!</li>
    <li> Great product I would order it again.</li>
    <li> I would rather just post my stars but since it is required and a good idea, I must say product is OK.</li>
    <li> Great product hope to see results in the growth of my eyelashes</li>
    <li> Hi folks, thank you so much for your wonderful service...I will be back for more of your wonderful products and service.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different castor oils and this one seems to work the best for me....I mainly use it for my edges to increase growth and it had done wonders....my aunt use to have to get black outs because she was loosing her edges really badly, I convinced her to put castor oil on them and 80 % of her edges grew back....she was only doing it once or twice a week( mainly when she felt like it) and in a month is when she had the 80 % growth....this oil works wonders and works best if you heat it up in the microwave a little before use</li>
    <li> Love . New must have in household</li>
    <li> I have purchased 3 different castor oil products through my local stores. This is by far superior. (I personally believe the others were made of olive oil or vegetable/soy oils) WOW! What a difference! The shipping was super fast. I will definitely purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I have used it for about 1 week and have noticed my face more soft glowing and dewy. I have not seen my eye lashes longer but i have read that takes longer so i will wait for that. So i do recommend!</li>
    <li> I waited a month to write this review in order to see the effects...my hair has totally thickened where I had thinning spots...and my hair has grew 3 inches in one month...I also used it on my eyelashes and brows...they have lengthened but they have not thickened as much as I like...I will continue to use it as a weekly oil treatment in mines and my daughter hair...</li>
    <li> this is a very thick, viscous oil and smells a bit weird but it&#x27;s not too overpowering. I use it on my eyelashes and so far it has shown a bit of growth, not too much of a difference. I still think olive oil works much better but i will continue to apply castor oil. This is a very big bottle and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff! My skin is so happy now in this dry winter weather.</li>
    <li> Large bottle just started waiting now to see results I&#x27;m excited !! I mix mine with jojoba oil peppermint oil lavender and eucalyptus for hair growth!</li>
    <li> The best Castor Oil I have found to date.  1. It is fresh so it is pretty much odorless which makes it more tasteless and easier to swallow. 2. it is cold pressed and hexane free. 3. It is potent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed an added benefit of putting it on broken skin it helps really speed healing.  What really surprised me, was the accidental discovery of using it on my face.  Doing this overnight dramatically reduced signs of aging on my face.  This brand is a particularly great oil for any Edgar Caycee castor oil treatments. Yes, I&#x27;m name dropping to help those just learning about castor.  Sadly, since heath freedom is illegal, please be clear my opinions are just that, my opinions. So, please do not take them as medical advice.</li>
    <li> Good item &#x27;, shipping was fast as I respected . I do recommend this product  to anyone , for the hair, for your skin and I am gonna used for my eyebrow and eyelashes because I heard that it can make them longer .</li>
    <li> I purchased this castor oil as an ingredient in a homemade pre shave lotion, for me it did exactly what I expected, softened my beard, slicked my face to the point that my razor just glides over my face.</li>
    <li> I love this oil,leaves my face smooth.It help a lot with wrinkles under my eyes.Doesn&#x27;t clog pores so far.Very pleased with transaction.</li>
    <li> I use this product in conjunction with Olive oil and Vitamin E for a homemade oil facial cleanse.  It works wonders!</li>
    <li> I like that this is a thick oil. I&#x27;ve been using organic EV coconut oil by itself for awhile and it&#x27;s great, but making a 50/50 oil mixture with this has really done wonders for my hair. It supposedly has hair thickening properties so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping to see in the long run. The downside is that this oil stinks like charred rubber. If you use it by itself whether on your skin or hair, people might smell it on you. Also since its thick I have to wash my hair more often. I usually wash with a sulfate shampoo once a month and co wash the other 3 weeks of the month. Now Instead of cowashing I use a sulfate free shampoo. Lastly, the price was super affordable and it was shipped neatly.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product it leaves my curly kinky hair soft,shiny,and feeling healthy. I hope it makes my hair grow some.</li>
    <li> I use it as make up remover and body oil.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the oil is working out great. I use it in my oil cleaning method at night before bed.</li>
    <li> Castor oil has a zillion uses. This company is reputable and the castor oil is cold pressed, unlike the junk laxative from walmart. I use this on my eyelashes at night. Who knows if it actually helps them grow longer, but they remain conditioned and strong and I attribute it to this oil. I also use it for the oil cleansing method, mixed with some grapeseed oil and essential oil of my choice. Cleanses great and doesn&#x27;t break me out. I&#x27;ve used this in hair masks- it is sticky and oil residue in my thick hair is sometimes difficult to remove, but no fault of this oil, just my hair type. Lastly, this has been used in castor oil packs on myself and my husband..&lt;br /&gt;Castor oil is a versatile oil and when choosing a castor oil, make sure it is of good quality and cold pressed. You can google all the different uses of castor oil. Definitely a staple in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> This product is great for hair and skin repairing. I love using when I go to bed.</li>
    <li> great price. On time delivery.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.  The item is great</li>
    <li> thanks a lot! does wonders to my hair! A + + + + + + + + shipped quick too.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help grow my eyelashes longer.  Its a thing, look it up on YouTube.  This stuff is thick and doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, in my opinion.  It&#x27;ll last forever.  I kind of fell of the band wagon of putting int on my lashes before bed every night, but plan to start up again sometime soon.  I did use it for 3 weeks straight and my eyelashes did look longer.</li>
    <li> for ezcema on hands and many other maladies this works great ..a little slow on delievery but as the best castor oil product</li>
    <li> Very heavy oil that must be rubbed into your scalp vigorusly. And thoroughly wash your hair the next day.</li>
    <li> 5 stars speaks for itself.</li>
    <li> This castor oil is fine, but it started growing something in the bottom (greenish cloudy stuff - maybe a fungus?) pretty soon after I started using it. It stopped growing after about a month and then just sat at at the bottom. Not sure what it was consuming that ran out. Had to throw away.</li>
