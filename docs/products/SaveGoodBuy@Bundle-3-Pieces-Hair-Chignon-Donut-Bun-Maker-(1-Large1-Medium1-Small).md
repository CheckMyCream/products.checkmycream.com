      <li>I loved it at first</li>
      <li>However, the first time I used this I did it without even looking in the mirror and it looked pretty darn good!</li>
      <li>:) My hair isn&#x27;t as dark as the donut itself but masks everything perfectly.</li>
      <li>, it looks great, so so comfortable the different size is perfect thanks very much</li>
      <li>So quick and easy to do!</li>
      <li>so easy to use and make buns.</li>
      <li>, it makes it really easy to do the bun.</li>
      <li>If you have fine hair, start with just the smallest size and you might save some money.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and they still worked.  </li>

      <li>And it looks fabulous every time.</li>
      <li>It is so quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>and you look smart and sophisticated in it</li>
      <li>I love the small one, it works great.  </li>
      <li>the array of sizes were good, works well, i used you tube to learn how to put in my hair properly.</li>
      <li>The instructions that come with are misleading and unclear, but overall a good product.</li>
      <li>The smallest one is perfect for those with thick hair.</li>
      <li>I used some on line tutorials and have had great success making pretty buns for all of different hair types.</li>
      <li>I thought they would end up coming undone really quick</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly and are just what I needed.</li>
      <li>I can throw up my hair in a perfect bun wet or dry and be out the door quick!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>do that looks nice and fancy and the fact you can pick from three different sizes works</li>
      <li>It was worth buying.</li>
      <li>Also, I loved how they included the spiral pins, other hair clips,and the matching pony tail holder.</li>
      <li>This did not work good because I have straight long hair.  </li>
      <li>They are easy to use, and there are a lot of youtube videos available to show different techniques.</li>
      <li>I have a little bit of layering in my hair, but you couldn&#x27;t tell because the bun looked nice and clean with no pieces sticking out.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>this is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>These are such a fun easy way to keep your hair neatly in one place and poof up the bun.</li>
      <li>I like it, thanks very much</li>
      <li>I thought it would work better in my hair, but I think my hair is too long for this to work</li>
      <li>I looked long and hard for one of these because my friend uses one and her buns always look so awesome and neat!  </li>
      <li>The largest one is ridiculously large and I won&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>I have used the large one, and i did get compliments on my hair.  </li>
      <li>After buying this, I wish there was a size that was in-between the medium and large size bun maker.  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; bun would better suit someone who has hair up to the shoulders or shorter, and the &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; is so small that it would better suit a young child.</li>
      <li>But the big one works just fine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> so easy to use and make buns.</li>
    <li> This is perfect - even though it came from China, it arrived ahead of schedule! The three different sizes are so great, and they threw in a few extra spin pins and hair elastics! Thank you! Will totally buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I love to make buns. This makes it look perfect. I have received so many compliments. And nobody has it as perfect as me. And it comes in different sizes. So you can do a high bun. A low bun. And it looks fabulous every time. Thank you to whoever invented that. The old sock trick can rest in peace with this product.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for new ways to style my hair.  This did not work good because I have straight long hair.  I did my sister&#x27;s hair and it was great...she has a little curl in her hair...so it is all about the texture.</li>
    <li> This has to be the easiest hair product known to man.  Seriously, even my mother can do it! haha  It is so quick and easy.  The instructions that come with are misleading and unclear, but overall a good product.</li>
    <li> These are such a fun easy way to keep your hair neatly in one place and poof up the bun.</li>
    <li> I got this because I have super thin hair and wanted a bun larger than 1in diameter.  I have used the large one, and i did get compliments on my hair.  I find the material grabs the hair just a little, which helps keep it in place along with bobby pins.  the small one is too small, but for the price it was worth it for the med and large bun makers.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time keeping loose strands and bun in place.  Don&#x27;t buy this!  It&#x27;s made of a velcro like material, but hair doens&#x27;t really stick.  So junk.</li>
    <li> Love these. I use the medium size the most but it makes a nice bun. I wear it almost everyday!  Good quality and feels good. I have a tender scalp and these do not pull or feel tight on my head. Glad I ordered these</li>
    <li> I only use the large doughnut  because my hair is a little longer than shoulder length and it gives me a perfect bun every time. The only drawback is that I made the mistake of pulling loose fibers and I ultimately destroyed it. The &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; bun would better suit someone who has hair up to the shoulders or shorter, and the &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; is so small that it would better suit a young child.</li>
    <li> Ive only tried the large one, for I have alot of hair (length along to my nipples, as a 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; lady) but it worked impressively amazing. I have never been good at putting my hair in a bun myself, but this product is so easy anyone can do it. It works by sliding it onto your pony-tail and tucking in your hair around the edges until perfectly concealed. I would recommend this product for any women who want to look profession but cant do alot with their hair, or just anyone that wants the perfect bun.</li>
    <li> The bun makers were horrible. They smelled and were prickly, like they would tangle in your hair and not come out without being cut out. I ended up tossing them in the trash. They took forever to get here I didn&#x27;t want to deal with them.</li>
    <li> I have recommended this to others who have asked me about these hair accessories.  I am very happy I purchased it. That is all I have to say.  Than you.</li>
    <li> I love using these in my three daughter&#x27;s hair and my own.  I used some on line tutorials and have had great success making pretty buns for all of different hair types.</li>
    <li> It does what it is suppose to do. I&#x27;ve never bought anything like this so I can&#x27;t compare but it stays put and is a deep brown.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. I am growing out a short hair cut so the two smallest sizes work perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> I have always been fair, and my hair has always matched that style and I am only just now growing it out, so I really need the little donut. The other day I used the middle one. It is so great to be offered the choice of which one to use! I usually only see these offered individually so I am grateful to this seller for offering all three in one package. They are great and I love using them and they are very easy to use, do yourself a favor and go to youtube and go through a few tutorials on how to use these. Again, thank you dear seller for offering all three different sizes all in one package.</li>
    <li> These might be good for people with long, thick hair, but I have medium length fine hair and none of the sizes worked for me--even the smallest one.  The texture of the pieces is very rough--like a brillo pad you might use for washing dishes.  Not my style! A very simple diagram is included, but I thought it was hard to understand. I have to admit I&#x27;m not a super stylin&#x27; hair girl, so that could be part of it!  So if you&#x27;re like me and need lots of direction, you might want to skip this one.  Anyway,  I&#x27;ll be donating these to someone else who can hopefully use them!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, works great. I have three daughters so the multiple sizes worked out perfectly. The texture really helps your hair keep the bun shape. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> These bun makers work great and are decent sizes for the women in our family. I gave it four stars, because I still had to go back out to purchase an even larger one, as my hair is longer. Most days, honestly, I create my own bun for a messier, fuller effect. But this set does what it says it will do for a price that is comparable for what is out there.</li>
    <li> Their really firm. I thought they would end up coming undone really quick but they didn&#x27;t. It was worth buying.</li>
    <li> My daughter is in the Air Force.  She loves these.  She can get her hair pulled back nicely in less than 3 minutes.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell any difference in color or quality between these bun makers and the more expensive version sold at Wal* and Targ*. The largest one is ridiculously large and I won&#x27;t use it. The smallest one is perfect for those with thick hair. The medium sized one is the same size as the standard bun-maker sold at Wal* and Targ*. I viewed them side by side and couldn&#x27;t see any difference at all. Buying all three was significantly less expensive than buying one at the store.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE! I have fine hair so I always end up with small flat buns...this is exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I received these in the amount of time as I was told. I have really loved using these bun makers, they are easy and make cute hairstyles.</li>
    <li> Shipping took awhile, but I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I was only able to use the largest one of these; the others were too small for my long hair. However, it was difficult for me to figure out how to wrap my hair around it and have it stay in there.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to use,at first but with some practice it looks good! This was suggested by a Sgt.</li>
    <li> My hair is fairly thick and reaches the middle of my back.  I use all three of these pieces, each for a different look.  They are easy to use, and there are a lot of youtube videos available to show different techniques.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that I get 3 different sizes, for whatever mood I am in. They don&#x27;t look or feel cheap and stay put, very comfortable doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use all three of the sizes and they hold my hair in really great. and they are really well hidden</li>
    <li> Great price for these.</li>
    <li> These really do make the perfect bun, and having different sizes are great for different occasions. So quick and easy to do!</li>
    <li> I think these items were useless.  If you want to spend an hour or two styling your hair with one of these, go for it.  I thought they served no purpose.  I also have the long one that snaps together.  That item works much better and easier than these.  I discarded them.</li>
    <li> With hair that&#x27;s below my waist, having something to put it up into an elegant bun is quite the luxury. I&#x27;ve since donated it all and all I had to do was use the smaller donut for my little bun. :) My hair isn&#x27;t as dark as the donut itself but masks everything perfectly. I recommend purchasing this with the spiral hair pin clip (also here on Amazon) because it will hold your bun in place and nothing will move one bit. No bobby pins needed.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item and all three were the same size wasn&#x27;t happy it clearly said large medium small all items were small not happy</li>
    <li> I think that my hair is too long for the smaller ones so I should have just bought the big one. But the big one works just fine. I like the texture, it makes it really easy to do the bun.</li>
    <li> Great quality product! The three sizes are perfect for diferent hair styles and they also came nicely individually packed. Thanks</li>
    <li> Works well, glad I got all three sizes. I recently cut my hair and now need a size I didn&#x27;t think I would.</li>
    <li> I ordered the trio so that I could create different looks. I don&#x27;t think of my hair as long but super thick but these bun makers are too small for me. Giving to my niece.</li>
    <li> The big ones are REAALLY big so unless you planned on being queen amidala for Halloween pretty useless, but the smaller sizes are great.</li>
    <li> These buns are great! Match my hair color perfectly, I love the fact that they come in more then one size and good price for three of them.</li>
    <li> Daughter loved these.</li>
    <li> I see how this works but it&#x27;s too risky for me since I&#x27;m afraid of a little hair parting away and revealing a large mound of plastic underneath. A great hairstyle piece if you don&#x27;t move around a lot and just stay in one position all day on a non-windy day. Perfect for people who like to check the mirror every hour and primp.</li>
    <li> These have changed my life! I can throw up my hair in a perfect bun wet or dry and be out the door quick!</li>
    <li> Very easy to make a bun and you look smart and sophisticated in it I love it  what  else can I say</li>
    <li> I have a ton of thick long hair so I thought these would be great for summer buns.  They are hard to use and the materials is all wrong for a product to go in your hair.  not worth it--better off using the old sock trick for the bun--you can find the video on u-tube.  works better.</li>
    <li> But I will not recommend to use it if you have to much layered hair cause it&#x27;s just not going work</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and they still worked.  I tried the ones from the &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; and those didn&#x27;t work, but these did.  You just make a pony tail, put in on the end of your pony tail and just keep rolling up until all the hair is tucked in.  I have a little bit of layering in my hair, but you couldn&#x27;t tell because the bun looked nice and clean with no pieces sticking out.  I was actually surprised how well these worked.  I am going to use the smaller ones for my daughters.</li>
    <li> I recently jumped on the hair bun train. I have hair 2-3 inches past my bra strap in back, fine but alot of it. These buns are tiny, even the biggest one is really small. They are compact, meaning depending on if you wrap your hair around and form a bun, or simply pin it up, it is going to stay. I just thought according to the picture they appeared WAY bigger. Make sure you check your sizes before purchasing,</li>
    <li> I use the biggest one only as the other two many unappealing buns in my opinion. I loved it at first but then I noticed that as the donut began to give and widen, my buns looked less and less attractive. This is understandable, but in these conditions I&#x27;d prefer to spend my money on a three pack of the same size then get two donuts I can&#x27;t even use.</li>
    <li> I love these for my hair! They are awesome! The only thing is they start to stretch out after awhile.</li>
    <li> I looked long and hard for one of these because my friend uses one and her buns always look so awesome and neat!  After buying this, I wish there was a size that was in-between the medium and large size bun maker.  The large is just too big, but the medium is too small.  I thought it would work better in my hair, but I think my hair is too long for this to work, I have too much left over at the end that I can&#x27;t figure out what to do with it or how to pin it so that it&#x27;s not visible.  If I cut my hair shorter I&#x27;ll give it a shot, but for now it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t have snaps or velcro to allow you to extend them long to roll them down your ponytail and then attach at the bottom - they&#x27;re one piece.  They work ok but I usually use safety pins to keep them in place</li>
    <li> I really like this set as it has a mini and medium as well as large bun maker. Works great for all size buns. Good quality.</li>
    <li> the array of sizes were good, works well, i used you tube to learn how to put in my hair properly. good buy!</li>
    <li> These work great.. I use them everyday for a quick up do that looks nice and fancy and the fact you can pick from three different sizes works</li>
    <li> They arrived quickly and are just what I needed. Also they seem to hold up pretty well so far.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use they came quickly and are very nice.  It will be nice to have a great&lt;br /&gt;looking bun like everyone else.</li>
    <li> I like it, thanks very much, it looks great, so so comfortable the different size is perfect thanks very much</li>
    <li> Item arrived promptly and contained three firm, well-made bun form for hair. My daughters use them constantly, and they appear to be wearing well and holding up well under daily use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I saw a video on youtube of a girl showing the viewers how to create the best sock bun. I was very skeptical about this because I&#x27;m not very good at styling my hair. However, the first time I used this I did it without even looking in the mirror and it looked pretty darn good! I&#x27;m so pleased with this product and I will definitely recommend it to anyone. Also, I loved how they included the spiral pins, other hair clips,and the matching pony tail holder. SO PLEASED! :)</li>
    <li> I love the small one, it works great.  I never use the other sizes because I have really thin/fine hair.  I don&#x27;t have enough volume to surround the entire bun.  I have to really work and evenly distribute my hair to cover the smallest one but it&#x27;s worth it.  If you have fine hair, start with just the smallest size and you might save some money.</li>
