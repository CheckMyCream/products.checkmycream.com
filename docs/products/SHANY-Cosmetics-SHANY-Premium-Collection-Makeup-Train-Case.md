      <li>The case is sturdy and the clasps nice and strong.</li>
      <li>i absolutely love it</li>

      <li>Love that it has locks.</li>
      <li>I simply love my makeup case, it&#x27;s all that I imagined it to be.</li>
      <li>but up top</li>
      <li>so glad i got this</li>
      <li>and i love the leopard print!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the leopard print is super cute!</li>
      <li>I love that there is a brush holder that comes with the case and that I can organize everything so easily.  </li>
      <li>Dancers need to be able use their make-up case up close to there body so they can apply make-up easily while sitting on the floor.</li>
      <li>What a hit she just loved it and it holds so much.</li>
      <li>It has carrying straps that make for easy transport.</li>
      <li>and when I need to take out what iam using for the day it is so easy.</li>
      <li>I love it, it was love first sight.  </li>
      <li>It also comes with a shoulder strap, which is so comfortable and easy to use and carry</li>
      <li>, I was scared to receive a junky box, but this one is amazing, I always bought target clear cases, which is also good, but its not even comparable, the case is large, already transferred 2 drawers in this case, took out  the brush holder and put in on my dresser</li>
      <li>The trays have a plastic bottom sewn in so it&#x27;ll be easy to keep clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We were excited to find this case because it has a mirror that flips up.</li>
      <li>i am a professional performer who travels and has lots of different stage makeup, this is an awesome purchase!</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know why, maybe I love it too much, but</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much stuff I am able to put in this case:  </li>
      <li>We needed a big case that can hold all her make-up and hair accessory&#x27;s for easy make-up and hair changes in dressing rooms which are almost always in a grand ballroom at a hotel with no mirrors and no tables available.</li>
      <li>, i use the lower trays for eyeshadow compacts, lipsticks, mascara, it is still very functional and the overall quality is great as it should be for $50 bucks</li>
      <li>The dancers are lucky if they get a chair to sit on.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The leopard decal is attractive and appears to be a heavy duty material.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it I think.</li>
      <li>I love the other items I got from them, but this one is going to be my favorite.</li>
      <li>Not only does it look great, but it actually forces me to stay organized.  </li>
      <li>This kit is adorable, has enough drawers for all my makeup, and travels well.</li>
      <li>The case arrived in 3 weeks - 2 weeks sooner than expected so that was a nice surprise.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item! !</li>
      <li>Just be aware that you&#x27;ll have to wait awhile to get it -</li>
      <li>This is such a lovely train set for cosmetics.</li>
      <li>A Dinair airbrush and compressor with all the associated cords, over 40 bottles of makeup, various stencils, bottles of cleaner, several full size brushes, cotton balls and swabs and more!</li>
      <li>but i really wanted a nice makeup case and they were sold out of black</li>
      <li>The print is amazing not cheap looking.</li>
      <li>Really like the jewelery case</li>
      <li>The case is very sturdy....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very roomy and holds a lot of products.  </li>
      <li>and it makes getting ready in the morning so much easier.  </li>
      <li>I love the bottom, how it can be wiped down in case of spills.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is NOT fuzzy it is a high quality plastic, as are all of these shany makeup cases from this particular line.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I paid a lot of money in high hopes</li>
      <li>it becomes top heavy and falls backwards.</li>
      <li>I am new to using Shany all shany products.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i think they should of had a little bit more play room for more makeup than the shallow trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>is the clear layer of dust protection on the surface of trays, so now if your makeup spills ,s epically the face powders, you don&#x27;t have to be worry about cleaning it, the case smells like new car</li>
      <li>so your heavy makeup is easy on the hands.</li>
      <li>and the mirror is large and actually functional.</li>
      <li>I really cannot say enough about this quality makeup train.</li>
      <li>I used to be a professional makeup artist</li>
      <li>but you cant tell and there is enough room that you can still close the case even if the mirror top is open a little bit</li>
      <li>i really like how the trays fold up and that there is plenty of space underneath them and next to them to store your taller and larger items, the handle also has padding on the under side</li>
      <li>but i have no regrets!</li>
      <li>, I really couldn&#x27;t stop myself, I have had this color in my wish list for a long, and I finally got it</li>
      <li>and it just barely doesnt close</li>

<li> I technically didn&#x27;t want to buy this, I had only $250 bonus check, which I went ahead and spent on shany nails and Shany gift set for my Christmas gifting, but last week I got this, since it was $50</li>
<li> you can only put so much stuff up there and keep it small!</li>
<li> I&#x27;d actually have sent it back for a replacement if I had time, but since I need it for a major trip and the shipping takes so long, it&#x27;s unlikely that I&#x27;d get it back in time.</li>
<li> Although it&#x27;s not a huge deal, I intend to use this case for a long time and would like it to last.</li>
<li> I spent a lot of time looking for a case to replace the Caboodles I&#x27;ve had forever.  </li>
<li> It is bigger than expected but not so overly large as to be awkward to carry or store.  </li>
<li> &amp; I&#x27;m extremely please with my purchase.</li>
<li> It falls down.</li>
<li> the only thing that is a little annoying is how shallow the trays are, but the top tray i put my bulky bronzer in</li>
<li> for instance, i tried to put my eyelash curler in one of the trays and couldnt (sephora black one that they sell in stores).</li>
<li> It holds all my makeup items and it comes with two sets of keys to keep little children from messing up the makeup.</li>
<li> i was a little nervous about spending $50 on a makeup case</li>
<li> it can get a little irritating when theres really no room.</li>
<li> reason i give it 4 stars is that the trays a little too shallow.</li>

    <li> I bought this for a Christmas gift for my sons girlfriend. What a hit she just loved it and it holds so much. It is well made ,functional and organized .  I highly recommend this item! !</li>
    <li> This case was ordered for my daughter to use while we travel city to city and state to state for her dance competitions. We needed a big case that can hold all her make-up and hair accessory&#x27;s for easy make-up and hair changes in dressing rooms which are almost always in a grand ballroom at a hotel with no mirrors and no tables available. The girls are always sitting on floor to do their make-up and hair during competitions. The dancers are lucky if they get a chair to sit on.&lt;br /&gt;We were excited to find this case because it has a mirror that flips up. However, the mirror on this case does not stay up. It falls down. What&#x27;s the point of having a attached mirror if it does not stay up when needed. Also when case is opened on one side only, (the side with the mirror) it becomes top heavy and falls backwards. My daughter then has to wrap her legs around case to support it so it wont fall over. When you open both sides, the side closest to my daughter is in the way. Dancers need to be able use their make-up case up close to there body so they can apply make-up easily while sitting on the floor. I paid a lot of money in high hopes this case would be all we needed. Now sits at home during competitions while a different make-up case travels with us.</li>
    <li> Just what i wanted, i use it to carry my makeup for class. The print is amazing not cheap looking. Love that it has locks.</li>
    <li> Really like the jewelery case but I thought it would have more room.  But wonderful for travel! The case is very sturdy....</li>
    <li> It was more than I had every hope for and I am so happy with it and the look of it. I would recommend this case to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I am new to using Shany all shany products.  I needed a makeup case to have all my make up organzized and in the same place.&lt;br /&gt;This case fits, all my makeup, with room for plenty more.  I love the bottom, how it can be wiped down in case of spills.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to have all my make up in one place and when I need to take out what iam using for the day it is so easy. It also comes with a shoulder strap, which is so comfortable and easy to use and carry</li>
    <li> I love my makeup case!! I love having my makeup organized and all in one place!</li>
    <li> Would recommend to anyone for an upgrade from smaller case. Delivered as shown, made well, looks great and has plenty of room.</li>
    <li> This is such a lovely train set for cosmetics. The size is good. It holds all my makeup items and it comes with two sets of keys to keep little children from messing up the makeup. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup case i have ever bought! i was a little nervous about spending $50 on a makeup case but i have no regrets! the leopard print is super cute! it is NOT fuzzy it is a high quality plastic, as are all of these shany makeup cases from this particular line. i really like how the trays fold up and that there is plenty of space underneath them and next to them to store your taller and larger items, the handle also has padding on the under side so your heavy makeup is easy on the hands. the shoulder strap is a nice add on. and the mirror is large and actually functional. the only thing that is a little annoying is how shallow the trays are, but the top tray i put my bulky bronzer in and it just barely doesnt close but you cant tell and there is enough room that you can still close the case even if the mirror top is open a little bit, i use the lower trays for eyeshadow compacts, lipsticks, mascara, it is still very functional and the overall quality is great as it should be for $50 bucks, im always looking for the best deal but i really wanted a nice makeup case and they were sold out of black but i am so gld i went with the leopard print i absolutely love it, i thought i did not need all this space but i a so glad i got this i can now organize all my beauty products no ore misplacing makeup and nail polish, i even have room to throw y leg warmers and outfit for when i do my gigs,oh yeah i am a professional performer who travels and has lots of different stage makeup, this is an awesome purchase! will be looking into more shany products!</li>
    <li> This kit is adorable, has enough drawers for all my makeup, and travels well. I take it everytime we go away and have had no issues. Great value.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time looking for a case to replace the Caboodles I&#x27;ve had forever.  This Shany case is awesome!  Not only does it look great, but it actually forces me to stay organized.  There is a place for everything and it makes getting ready in the morning so much easier.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Beautiful color &amp; great size.  Bought it as a gift for myself. Instead of carrying three to four separate makeup bags I opted for this &amp; I&#x27;m extremely please with my purchase. It has carrying straps that make for easy transport.</li>
    <li> I technically didn&#x27;t want to buy this, I had only $250 bonus check, which I went ahead and spent on shany nails and Shany gift set for my Christmas gifting, but last week I got this, since it was $50, I really couldn&#x27;t stop myself, I have had this color in my wish list for a long, and I finally got it, I was scared to receive a junky box, but this one is amazing, I always bought target clear cases, which is also good, but its not even comparable, the case is large, already transferred 2 drawers in this case, took out  the brush holder and put in on my dresser , I don&#x27;t need the shoulder strap, so that&#x27;s not necessary for me. But the case is just awesome, one thing I love the most is the clear layer of dust protection on the surface of trays, so now if your makeup spills ,s epically the face powders, you don&#x27;t have to be worry about cleaning it, the case smells like new car, I don&#x27;t know why, maybe I love it too much, but let&#x27;s say this is going to be my best purchase from Shany ever. I love the other items I got from them, but this one is going to be my favorite.</li>
    <li> I bought this case to organize my makeup both at home and when I travel.  It&#x27;s very roomy and holds a lot of products.  I like the attached mirror--sometimes hotel rooms have mirrors in inconvenient places, so it&#x27;s nice to have a mirror wherever you need it.</li>
    <li> I simply love my makeup case, it&#x27;s all that I imagined it to be. it also has lot&#x27;s of storage and well constructed.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend often gets upset with me when i leave makeup all over the place. this helps me keep everything together and organized. its sturdy and i love the leopard print!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only reason i give it 4 stars is that the trays a little too shallow. you can only put so much stuff up there and keep it small! theres room at the bottom for \\&quot;bulkier\\&quot; items like foundation and things like that but up top it can get a little irritating when theres really no room. for instance, i tried to put my eyelash curler in one of the trays and couldnt (sephora black one that they sell in stores). it would \\&quot;lift\\&quot; up and be crooked when you fold the trays back down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think they should of had a little bit more play room for more makeup than the shallow trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-jill</li>
    <li> I love it, it was love first sight.  The bottom is spacey, also has a holder for your brushes. Fits all of cosmetics , also the mirror comes in handy.</li>
    <li> I love that there is a brush holder that comes with the case and that I can organize everything so easily.  And, it fits all of my makeup.</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT! I DEF RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I have a lot of makeup all over the house.  This keeps me organized!  And quality of case is great.</li>
    <li> This item is &amp;#34;Top Drawer&amp;#34;. I used to be a professional makeup artist and I got to tell you this item has everything it says and more! It&#x27;s stylish exterior and roomy interior will knock your socks off! I really cannot say enough about this quality makeup train.</li>
    <li> The case arrived in 3 weeks - 2 weeks sooner than expected so that was a nice surprise. It is bigger than expected but not so overly large as to be awkward to carry or store.  The trays have a plastic bottom sewn in so it&#x27;ll be easy to keep clean. I can&#x27;t believe how much stuff I am able to put in this case:  A Dinair airbrush and compressor with all the associated cords, over 40 bottles of makeup, various stencils, bottles of cleaner, several full size brushes, cotton balls and swabs and more! The leopard decal is attractive and appears to be a heavy duty material. The case is sturdy and the clasps nice and strong. The only problem was that two of the side bars that extend the trays - one on each side - were bent causing the trays to sag when the lid is open and not align without adjustment when closing the lid . Although it&#x27;s not a huge deal, I intend to use this case for a long time and would like it to last. I&#x27;d actually have sent it back for a replacement if I had time, but since I need it for a major trip and the shipping takes so long, it&#x27;s unlikely that I&#x27;d get it back in time. I like the case a lot and definitely recommend. Just be aware that you&#x27;ll have to wait awhile to get it - but it&#x27;s worth it I think.</li>
