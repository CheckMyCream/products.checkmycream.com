      <li>This cream, though it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; me from my allergy to whatever was in my parents&#x27; house, alleviated my skin way better than anything else.</li>

      <li>My skin is already looking better.  </li>
      <li>I have some skin issues that this specifically helps clear up when they strike, but it&#x27;s also a great go-to lotion for anything from face to feet.</li>

      <li>I do know oatmeal is a good natural moisturizer</li>
      <li>What an absolute miracle!!!  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite all-around lotion.</li>
      <li>(The first application made a difference!)</li>
      <li>The larger size bottle is more secure.</li>
      <li>My daughter has reallt sensitive skin and most lotions burn her even fragrance-free....</li>
      <li>As an individual who has struggled with eczema for her whole life, I feel like this is a good alternative to my steroid cream.  </li>

      <li>This really eased up my peeling fingers quickly when nothing else worked.</li>
      <li>Really appreciate the stuff!</li>
      <li>This product worked pretty well on my eczema.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll even dab it on my pets if they have irritated hot spots.</li>
      <li>I recommend before going to any doctor to try this first.</li>
      <li>Experience was positive all around.</li>
      <li>Glad to see Amazon carrying this big bottle at a decent price.</li>
      <li>my skin is super sensitive, this one is very hydrated and gentle.</li>
      <li>This takes care of both problems very well.</li>
      <li>It soothes soreness, reduces red inflammation, and retains moisture so the skin is smooth and supple.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so gentle and never exacerbates anything or causes breakouts.</li>
      <li>I find that the Aveeno Eczema Therapy lotion dries fast and does not leave an oily or greasy residue.  </li>
      <li>A friend recommended this product and it really works.  </li>
      <li>I know everyone is different and has variable degrees of eczema, but for me, the Aveeno Eczema Therapy works best in soothing the itchiness and healing the dried cracked skin when used regularly.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve managed to reduce her symptoms significantly by doing 2 &#x27;bleach baths&#x27; a weeks covering her with aquaphor after bath and then using this daily.</li>
      <li>This is a mild lotion that soothes the itchy skin with no fragrance or extra chemicals.  </li>
      <li>We highly recomment Aveeno&#x27;s Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream.  </li>
      <li>Prior to a friend recommending Aveeno Eczema Therapy lotion to me, I have tried almost every major over the counter moisturizer available.  </li>
      <li>It works well, and it definitely helps calm the itching sensation.  </li>
      <li>It feels totally different than any other lotion or cream; I really feel better when using this product.</li>
      <li>The only thing we&#x27;ve found to work consistently for my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
      <li>I noticed results within the first several days of use...</li>
      <li>My daughter has dry spots on her arms and legs and this is the only product I have found that works to make her skin smooth and baby soft.</li>
      <li>Large sized bottle makes it last a while.</li>
      <li>her skin is clear now</li>
      <li>she&#x27;s 90 year old, but suffered from eczema for years.</li>
      <li>My daughter has eczema and ridiculously sensitive skin</li>
      <li>At least for me, it&#x27;s not the miracle cream that others have described it to be, but this cream has worked tremendously better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
      <li>As far as Eczema, I would not know if it helps or not.</li>
      <li>The redness went away and his skin felt soft for the first time in a long time.</li>
      <li>Definitely helps relieve the itchiness though living in a super dry climate.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not actually using this for eczema, so I can&#x27;t comment on that particular use.</li>
      <li>The other lotions I tried only gave me temporary relief (if any) and what bothered me the most was that they left my hands with an oily / greasy residue that I left on everything I touched.  </li>
      <li>Really relieves the dry skin.</li>
      <li>The smell was not bad at all, it was a faint scent of oatmeal but not bad in any way.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected!</li>
      <li>This Stuff really knocks out dry skin!</li>
      <li>I probably have to use my steroid for a few times every few months if my allergies are worse, but this is the best product I&#x27;ve found as a steroid alternative.</li>
      <li>In general, it keeps everything under control with daily use, and soothes the eczema.  </li>
      <li>all said, when I&#x27;m not in at my parents house (which is most of the time since I&#x27;m in college), my eczema is not as bad, and this cream really makes my face feel moisturized and protected.</li>

<li> Keep skin a long time moist</li>
<li> I went to 3 different doctors, spent over $500 trying to find out the source of my itchy legs.  </li>

    <li> best lotion i have found for eczema</li>
    <li> This lotion is magic for youngsters with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works great!!  I recommend this to anyone with eczema or extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a nice item. my grandma is using it. she&#x27;s 90 year old, but suffered from eczema for years. she tell me the cream is working good and her skin is clear now</li>
    <li> The only thing we&#x27;ve found to work consistently for my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s skin is very dry, especially in winter.  A friend recommended this product and it really works.  The active ingredient is oatmeal in a colloid, a gel-like cream.  A small amount goes a long way on skin right after a shower. It soothes soreness, reduces red inflammation, and retains moisture so the skin is smooth and supple.  I have even used it on my face when it was chapped from sun and wind.  We highly recomment Aveeno&#x27;s Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream.  Note that the smaller size tube can leak during airplane travel.  The larger size bottle is more secure.</li>
    <li> My daughter has reallt sensitive skin and most lotions burn her even fragrance-free....this one is great...no pain for her with this lotion</li>
    <li> As an individual who has struggled with eczema for her whole life, I feel like this is a good alternative to my steroid cream.  In general, it keeps everything under control with daily use, and soothes the eczema.  I probably have to use my steroid for a few times every few months if my allergies are worse, but this is the best product I&#x27;ve found as a steroid alternative.</li>
    <li> I thought this would work for my toddlers Eczema problems, but instead she has broken out in a rash on every place that I&#x27;ve used it. I have absolutely no idea why though. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this any less than I do. :(</li>
    <li> Prior to a friend recommending Aveeno Eczema Therapy lotion to me, I have tried almost every major over the counter moisturizer available.  The other lotions I tried only gave me temporary relief (if any) and what bothered me the most was that they left my hands with an oily / greasy residue that I left on everything I touched.  I find that the Aveeno Eczema Therapy lotion dries fast and does not leave an oily or greasy residue.  However, I do feel a micro thin layer of protection on my hands that is actually comfortable to me.  I know everyone is different and has variable degrees of eczema, but for me, the Aveeno Eczema Therapy works best in soothing the itchiness and healing the dried cracked skin when used regularly.  When I use it regularly, I find that I don&#x27;t get those itchy flare ups unless I do something to irritate my skin.  And even when I do irritate my skin (such as when I use abrasive cleaners or soaps), the flare ups are less extreme if I apply the Aveeno Eczema Therapy right after.  In my opinion, it is the best lotion for eczema available without a prescription.</li>
    <li> it works on my dry hands</li>
    <li> Experience was positive all around.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best I have ever used for my severe eczema !!  This one works for me !!  Remember that Eczema is exacerbated by diet also; so ask your doctor for other things that can make it worse like sweat, peanuts, spicy foods, etc.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my Dermatologist for moisturizing and replenishing, happy to report that it works very well. Non-greasy, very light fragrance. Great overall body lotion.</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema and ridiculously sensitive skin and we&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a while after trying many others. We&#x27;ve managed to reduce her symptoms significantly by doing 2 &#x27;bleach baths&#x27; a weeks covering her with aquaphor after bath and then using this daily. My itchy girl is much less itchier. Glad to see Amazon carrying this big bottle at a decent price.</li>
    <li> My bf has a very serious case of eczema. And it seems like this lotion calms his itchiness down a lot.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite all-around lotion. I have some skin issues that this specifically helps clear up when they strike, but it&#x27;s also a great go-to lotion for anything from face to feet. I&#x27;ll even dab it on my pets if they have irritated hot spots. It&#x27;s so gentle and never exacerbates anything or causes breakouts. Never greasy, not too thick or thin. I have a wide variety of skin care products, from drug-store to high-end, but this is the one I can&#x27;t go without.</li>
    <li> I had horrible eczema on my face due to allergies. The itching, redness and flaking was unbearable and looked horrible. I was ashamed to go outside my house. I started using this product and the change was remarkable. The itchy, flaky and redness is disappearing. I have finally found relief! I&#x27;ll be buying this lotion again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for my daughter since she was a baby. It seems to have minimized her eczema occurrence.</li>
    <li> Great Transaction and product! No Problems!</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes you stop itching good products</li>
    <li> It works well, and it definitely helps calm the itching sensation.  It may take a while for flareups to go away visibly though.</li>
    <li> Our friends living in the UK are using this for quite some time for their son, who has a skin problem. They said this helps, and asked us to help buying this here in the US and bring to them when we meet.</li>
    <li> i have used it for 3 weeks and it has not made a bit of difference.</li>
    <li> This was a miracle for me.  I have never had anything work as well as this.  I think that the colloidal oatmeal is the key.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno! My daughter gets eczema . This is my go to lotion. Nothing gets rid of it faster. Not even hydrocortisone !</li>
    <li> This really eased up my peeling fingers quickly when nothing else worked. I used it together with cotton moisturizing gloves for one night and saw improvement overnight. Stopped using it for 2 days and the blistering and peeling and cracking fingertips have recurred. Going back to using it tonight and every time I wash my hands as I was doing before. Hopefully the problems and unsightliness and painful fingers will go away forever with this product in my cabinet and in regular use. Really appreciate the stuff!</li>
    <li> Good&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve had problems with very dry skin but nothing helped.  Recently, I started noticing tiny patches on my skin.  Then I tried this Aveeno Eczema Therapy cream, and am now using it as a body cream.  It&#x27;s wonderful!!  My skin is already looking better.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit expensive for a body cream, but if it works...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> We have to use this lotion on our son every winter because he gets dry patches.  It clears them right up.</li>
    <li> Great for people with sensitive, itchy, dry skins.</li>
    <li> Helps with itchy legs caused by sever dry skin/eczema however the eczema/skin damage doesn&#x27;t seem to be going away.  Definitely helps relieve the itchiness though living in a super dry climate.</li>
    <li> My Mum had bad eczema on her legs and this really helped with clearing it up.</li>
    <li> NOT EFFECTIVE ON MY EXEMA</li>
    <li> I went to 3 different doctors, spent over $500 trying to find out the source of my itchy legs.  One doctor said to try Aveeno Eczema because she thought I might have eczema.  OMG....what a difference.  My legs do not itch anymore and no more scratching until I bleed.  What an absolute miracle!!!  I recommend before going to any doctor to try this first.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno prodects. This is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This item is very effective with eczema and allergy rashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not actually using this for eczema, so I can&#x27;t comment on that particular use. I got it because I have excessively dry skin and I&#x27;m prone to itchiness. This takes care of both problems very well.</li>
    <li> good product i bought it for my 4 months baby ,he is surfing his eczema,the doc recommend aveen but didn&#x27;t work ,another doc give me some medicine also didn&#x27;t work ,but i get this  it works well ,at the sametime my face is very dry ,after use avenue it became moist</li>
    <li> Nice lotion but didn&#x27;t work the miracles I was hoping for with eczema.</li>
    <li> It worked over night And I have tried everything</li>
    <li> This product worked pretty well on my eczema. Has a nice fragrance as well.</li>
    <li> Controls my eczema for a short time but doesn&#x27;t help as well as steroid cream during a flare up. Large sized bottle makes it last a while. If you have very bad eczema or psoriasis I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to control flare ups but as a daily lotion it is alright</li>
    <li> taste good，just like Avena,</li>
    <li> Very good and fit for dry weather.Keep skin a long time moist</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good because it has oatmeal in it, and it has no smell which is plus! It does however leave my skin with a greasy sticky feeling that i don&#x27;t care for, but it does help with my dry skin after showers and for general stuff. I do know oatmeal is a good natural moisturizer so it works. As far as Eczema, I would not know if it helps or not.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t have eczema, I did have REALLY dry skin with &amp;#34;Winter Itch&amp;#34;.  This is a mild lotion that soothes the itchy skin with no fragrance or extra chemicals.  Works for me!</li>
    <li> Great product for kids with eczema!</li>
    <li> This is useful with good price.</li>
    <li> love it. my skin is super sensitive, this one is very hydrated and gentle.</li>
    <li> I have eczema, and this stuff works great.  I often dont need to use topical steroids if I use this for several days, after seeing a spot of eczema</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has pretty bad skin eczema, and this lotion is one of the only brands that actually help and clear his face up. Life saver if there ever was one, buying in bulk from now on.</li>
    <li> The best eczema cream I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
    <li> Works like a cream but easy to apply like a lotion.  Works as good as Eucerine for my baby girl with eczema.</li>
    <li> Just perfect for my skin.</li>
    <li> Often recommended by dermatologists.  Colloidal oatmeal is the basis for most Aveeno skin products.  Works well.  Easy to use. Non-greasy.</li>
    <li> Immediately felt a difference on my nephew&#x27;s skin. The redness went away and his skin felt soft for the first time in a long time. The smell was not bad at all, it was a faint scent of oatmeal but not bad in any way.</li>
    <li> At least for me, it&#x27;s not the miracle cream that others have described it to be, but this cream has worked tremendously better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before. My eczema is environmental-- the worst of it is usually triggered when I go to my parents&#x27; house; my face breaks out; mostly the area around my eyes and cheek. My neck also gets bad. This cream, though it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; me from my allergy to whatever was in my parents&#x27; house, alleviated my skin way better than anything else. For the most part, I lost the urge to itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all said, when I&#x27;m not in at my parents house (which is most of the time since I&#x27;m in college), my eczema is not as bad, and this cream really makes my face feel moisturized and protected. It feels totally different than any other lotion or cream; I really feel better when using this product. I would definitely recommend this over anything else. I noticed results within the first several days of use... skin is much better now.</li>
    <li> Really relieves the dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick moisturizer and it helps calm my eczema. I use it whenever it starts to get dry and itch.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> My daughter has dry spots on her arms and legs and this is the only product I have found that works to make her skin smooth and baby soft.</li>
    <li> The only thing that keeps my eczema away all winter!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I don&#x27;t have eczema, but have what I call &amp;#34;winter skin&amp;#34;  Generally, right before it is time for bed, my skin feels like pins and needles poking me.  I have used this after showering for only two days, and last night, NOTHING.  No itching, no pins and no needles.  Try it.</li>
    <li> I bought wrong product.  My son has eczema ，i want it for baby.my husband is using it now.</li>
    <li> This Stuff really knocks out dry skin! I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve Used it several times as directed and already see/feel a difference! (The first application made a difference!) If your like me and have tried numerous lotions/creams looking for relief but we&#x27;re only dissatisfied/disappointed, you must try this before you give up the search!</li>
