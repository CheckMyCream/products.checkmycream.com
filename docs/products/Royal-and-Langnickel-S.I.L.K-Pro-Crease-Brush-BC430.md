    <li> I bought this after watching a YouTube tutorial on brushes best for hooded eyes. This is a great brush for creating a crease because it is so soft that it doesn&#x27;t move the skin on the hood much, unlike other brushes. I give it only 4 stars because when mine arrived it would make a weird clicking sound like the brush was loose on the handle. One day I decided just to pull off the brush tip and pop it back one. Since doing that, it no longer makes that loose clicking noise.</li>
