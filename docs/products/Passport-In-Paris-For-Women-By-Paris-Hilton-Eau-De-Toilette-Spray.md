      <li>to the review this is one of my wife favorite fragrances.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this perfume.</li>
      <li>GET MORE THAN ONE</li>
      <li>and my husband loves it too :)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very good, the smell last for all day.</li>
      <li>A light gourmand suitable for all ages, fresh and appropriate for daytime wear.</li>
      <li>I love it perfect for movie nights or everyday.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great summer scent and seems to be more for a younger woman.</li>
      <li>I love a sweet smelling perfume to wear for datenights.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and somewhat flowery</li>
      <li>I was totally surprised how much I loved this perfume.</li>
      <li>I feel very good, the product arrived on time, the packaging was closed in original original box.</li>
      <li>Bottle is not at all elegant looking, and geared more toward very young girls.  </li>
      <li>It is so sweet and light that you dont need to apply a lot</li>
      <li>:) the bottle is huge and it was shipped fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely cheaper on Amazon vs. Kohls and Macys and it&#x27;s worth every cent!!!!</li>
      <li>Overall good value.</li>
      <li>This perfume is pretty and light sweet.</li>
      <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t have picked it up if I had seen that first!  </li>
      <li>I wish I had the lotion it last a very long time Paris did an awesome job</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve never had anything buy authentic merchandise when it&#x27;s sold directly by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I sprayed it on my 3 years old daughter&#x27;s arm, she sniffed at it and said: \\&quot;mommy, it is candy :)\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s def worth it.</li>
      <li>ITS WORTH</li>
      <li>Not terribly unique or sophisticated, but what were you expecting for this great low price?</li>
      <li>As a 34 year old mother of 2 I am not generally attracted to products with her name on them but this parfume is amazing!  </li>
      <li>It does not have that much of a floral scent; just a sweet, sugary, cotton candy-like smell, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just enough, not too strong!</li>
      <li>well thank you very much</li>
      <li>I received my item(s) in a very timely manner!  </li>
      <li>I received exactly what I ordered</li>
      <li>Probably best suited as a gift for a teenager, or once in a while casual scent.</li>
      <li>This perfume is my absolute favorite, so I ordered several bottles.  </li>
      <li>But for such a low price for a 3.4 oz bottle, it is a good deal.</li>
      <li>It smells nice in bottle and also pleasant when I first spray on but after a while it changes into a slightly sickly scent on me.</li>
      <li>This is &amp;#34;don&#x27;t want to spend that much money on Viva La Juicy</li>
      <li>you for fast shipping.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fellas you can&#x27;t go wrong with this choice, no need to spend 40-80 on a nice scent your lady or daughter will love you for this.</li>
      <li>It does not have a very distinctive smell like high end, designer perfumes.</li>
      <li>To me, it&#x27;s just ok and nothing special--pretty run of the mill, average scent.</li>
      <li>cuz it doesn&#x27;t last that long anyway, but can spend some of the money on this and have lots left over for a mani/pedi&amp;#34; good.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is very soft and musky.  </li>
      <li>I usually wear higher end fragrances, but thought I would try for something light and different after reading positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>It also has a hint of floral in it and it mixes well with the sweet almost pink candy smell.</li>
      <li>Hello everyone first let me start by saying only purchase fragrances sold directly by Amazon.</li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone who doesnt like heavy strong perfume</li>
      <li>I dont really wear it during the day unless i was to be outside all day</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This perfume is my absolute favorite, so I ordered several bottles.  The product I received does not smell like other bottles I have purchased in a department store.  I am disappointed.  It seems watered down.</li>
    <li> I was totally surprised how much I loved this perfume. Got a free sample and loved it. Reminds me of Clinique &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34; except the Clinique perfume started bothering my allergies after a while and this doesn&#x27;t! Great...loved it!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  I&#x27;m NOT a fan of Paris Hilton, but I do like her fragrances.  This is my favorite though.  I get compliments from total strangers whenever I wear this fragrance.  I love it.  It&#x27;s my favorite.  I bought like two bottles and 3 gift sets of this stuff.  This is strange considering that I worked at a perfume counter and had access to wear high end designer fragrances and I choose this one over them lol.  Guess it goes to show that a big fancy name isn&#x27;t everything lol</li>
    <li> exelent producto very good</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this perfume. It&#x27;s a great summer scent and seems to be more for a younger woman. I have got a lot of compliments from men and women. I am about to purchase my 5th bottle. It&#x27;s definitely cheaper on Amazon vs. Kohls and Macys and it&#x27;s worth every cent!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I don&#x27;t think I will be wearing anything else but this!! It&#x27;s just enough, not too strong! Hope they never stop making it!!Thank You!</li>
    <li> The price it&#x27;s very good, the smell last for all day. I will recomend. To all thank you. Can&#x27;t  beat the price</li>
    <li> Great amount, great smell, great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with Passport Paris Eau-de-toilette by Paris Hilton... Get many compliments from everyone! :))))&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Aweesome, I love it!!! Its a good quality and good price! I want a least three more and try different!</li>
    <li> El servicio de entrega estuvo a la altura de la empresa que representa, Felicitaciones por la seriedad y responsabilidad que han demostrado.&lt;br /&gt; Continuen así</li>
    <li> Perfect for the girly girl. This perfume is pretty and light sweet. It also has a hint of floral in it and it mixes well with the sweet almost pink candy smell. I love it! I also own paris hilton south beach they are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Found this at a department store for alot more money.  I picked it up and smelled it and liked if for the smell before even knowing it was by Paris Hilton.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have picked it up if I had seen that first!  As a 34 year old mother of 2 I am not generally attracted to products with her name on them but this parfume is amazing!  Parfumes (no matter how expensive) never small good or last on me.  This one is a huge exception!  I am in love!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance it smells bomb I wish I had the lotion it last a very long time Paris did an awesome job her fragrances always smells good!</li>
    <li> well thank you very much</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and at macys it was 50$ for a 1 oz. bottle. I bought it to try it and loved it.  I recently ran out and decided id try here. Bought it from amazon and had it in 4 days for under 20$ im extremely Impressed. :) the bottle is huge and it was shipped fast. What more could u want.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant and dessert-like, as you might expect! A light gourmand suitable for all ages, fresh and appropriate for daytime wear. Not terribly unique or sophisticated, but what were you expecting for this great low price? Overall good value.</li>
    <li> Hello everyone first let me start by saying only purchase fragrances sold directly by Amazon. They&#x27;d allot of fake fragrances but I&#x27;ve never had anything buy authentic merchandise when it&#x27;s sold directly by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the review this is one of my wife favorite fragrances. It&#x27;s perfect for a woman age range of 20-40. It&#x27;s light and somewhat flowery I love it perfect for movie nights or everyday. I bought three bottles for the holidays my niece and two God daughters they absolutely loved it, and their mothers want to take their Paris from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fellas you can&#x27;t go wrong with this choice, no need to spend 40-80 on a nice scent your lady or daughter will love you for this.</li>
    <li> I love this scent!  I get compliments everytime I wear this!  I like a more fruity scent than a floral one!  I received my item(s) in a very timely manner!  Would or will buy from again!</li>
    <li> Bought this item at a excellent price, and it arrived on time. The scent is wonderful,  I am one very pleased customer!</li>
    <li> I love love this perfume. I feel in love with this perfume. This perfume is perfect for the spring/summer. It can be worn as an everyday perfume as well.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! It smells amazing and I get a lot of compliments!</li>
    <li> Yes I absolutely Love it!</li>
    <li> my daughter douses herself in this every day. seller has it for a great price and the smell is not nauseating at all.</li>
    <li> It smells nice in bottle and also pleasant when I first spray on but after a while it changes into a slightly sickly scent on me. I have mixed feelings about this one. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great price and the wife loves it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS ONE..ITS A FLORAL SCENT IVE HAD BEFORE AND U CANT BEAT THE PRICE .....GET MORE THAN ONE ITS WORTH IT .....</li>
    <li> I feel very good, the product arrived on time, the packaging was closed in original original box. very satisfied excellent</li>
    <li> Ok. It does not have a very distinctive smell like high end, designer perfumes. If you don&#x27;t love it, you won&#x27;t hate it. It does not have that much of a floral scent; just a sweet, sugary, cotton candy-like smell, in my opinion. The lasting power is kind of weak. I would have to keep re-applying it throughout the day. When I sprayed it on my 3 years old daughter&#x27;s arm, she sniffed at it and said: \\&quot;mommy, it is candy :)\\&quot;.  If I applied 3 squirts on her,she would smell like a walking cotton candy :).  But for such a low price for a 3.4 oz bottle, it is a good deal. I will wear it occasionally, but will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I usually wear higher end fragrances, but thought I would try for something light and different after reading positive reviews.  To me, it&#x27;s just ok and nothing special--pretty run of the mill, average scent. Bottle is not at all elegant looking, and geared more toward very young girls.  Probably best suited as a gift for a teenager, or once in a while casual scent.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is very soft and musky.  This is my second bottle I have bought.  I recommend it to anyone who doesnt like heavy strong perfume</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I ordered so I give that rating because I am satisfied and happy with my product.</li>
    <li> I love a sweet smelling perfume to wear for datenights. It is so sweet and light that you dont need to apply a lot but it lasts for about 4 hours. I dont really wear it during the day unless i was to be outside all day but i am so happy with this product and my husband loves it too :)</li>
    <li> thank you very much is a good choice of gift for my wife and my daughters and my fragrance ancanta also</li>
    <li> This is good. This is &amp;#34;don&#x27;t want to spend that much money on Viva La Juicy cuz it doesn&#x27;t last that long anyway, but can spend some of the money on this and have lots left over for a mani/pedi&amp;#34; good.</li>
    <li> I love all Paris&#x27; perfumes, this isn&#x27;t my FAVORITE but it still smells really good and for the price on Amazon it&#x27;s def worth it.</li>
