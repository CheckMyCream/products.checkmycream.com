      <li>thanks Amazon !</li>
      <li>If you want the low price, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>These are exactly like the overpriced ones at the department stores.  </li>
      <li>I have not used my Clarisonic for a couple weeks now because of original brush heads are old and I&#x27;d rather not use these brush heads at all.</li>

      <li>Great job, and they are identical to the super expensive clarisonic brushes.</li>
      <li>Saves so much money.</li>
      <li>I will have to buy the brand name ones because these don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
      <li>I always purchase the real clarisonic brush heads</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell any difference between these generic brushes and the original.</li>
      <li>I normally get the gentle in the name brand for my clairisonic.</li>
      <li>Sometimes my skin which is a (little sensitive) gets red in the cheek area with these heads, but I think it does a good job on my nose and forehead.  </li>
      <li>So soft and just as gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that dries out quickly and easily, especially during the winter.</li>
      <li>Very soft</li>
      <li>Exactly the same as the</li>
      <li>Exactly the same as the clarisonic brushes.</li>
      <li>But if you treat your face seriously, I suggest you get the real Clarisonic brush heads, although it might cost you more.</li>
      <li>Wow replacement heads  2 for $47 when you can get four of them for what $8</li>
      <li>The brush heads definitely do not compare to the real Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
      <li>I wish I had read a review like this, because I would have ordered the even more delicate (luxe, I think?)</li>
      <li>wOW what a difference  </li>
      <li>I got the real ones for several times.</li>
      <li>I inspected them and compared them to my old Clarasonic brush and they are identical.  </li>
      <li>I have never used the other types of replacement head (sensitive, deep cleansing, or normal)</li>
      <li>Was nervous when ordering new replacement brush heads that were not the name brand clarasonic but figured what did I have to loose?</li>
      <li>These are definitely not as soft as the sensitive skin ones by Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t do that with the normal brush head because it was way too rough.</li>
      <li>The price is great, but when you have delicate skin, you want the soft and delicate brush heads that FEEL soft and delicate.  </li>
      <li>Love this delicate brushes!!</li>

<li> I really like the soft bristles of the delicate brush.  </li>
<li> Some people suggested that the delicate brush is TOO delicate for their skin, and the don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s getting as clean as it normally would with a regular brush.</li>
<li> These are not as soft as previous generic brush heads I have purchased on Amazon.  </li>

<li> The sensitive skin ones were still abrasive and made my skin feel raw.  </li>
<li> I probably should have switched from the normal to a delicate brush a long time ago, but again, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself to have delicate skin but the normal brushes that came with it made my face feel like it was windburn.</li>
<li> These brush heads were not as soft as other replacement delicate brush heads that I have bought from Amazon, either generic or clarisonic brands.</li>
<li> These brushes are great , You won&#x27;t be disappointed !!</li>
<li> I have delicate skin, so I need cleansing brush that is soft and won&#x27;t irritate my face.  </li>
<li> and I know they aren&#x27;t that rough.</li>
<li> I believe I spent</li>
<li> and they work and feel exactly the same but are much less expensive.</li>
<li> (Seriously, my Clarisonic purchase was epic in and of itself, since it&#x27;s a product that requires additional product$$$ over the course of time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> These are extremely rough and harsh for my skin.</li>
<li> Shipping was a little sluggish, but I saw that they came all the way from China...</li>
<li> Harsh and not the quality of the clarisonic brushes.</li>
<li> These feel stiff.</li>
<li> cleans well without hurting delicate skin.</li>
<li> I ordered these in the Delicate because of the reviews saying they were rougher.</li>
<li> I was wary to purchase these as some of the reviews were less than what I would expect in this product.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>

    <li> These brushes are great , You won&#x27;t be disappointed !!</li>
    <li> Works will with my Clarsonic.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Work just fine for the clarisonic I purchased at Nordstroms.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the real thing.</li>
    <li> These are definitely not as soft as the sensitive skin ones by Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> The brushes are not working out.  I will have to buy the brand name ones because these don&#x27;t work very well.  They don&#x27;t lget my skin clean like the brand name ones do.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> I was wary to purchase these as some of the reviews were less than what I would expect in this product.  Fortunately for me, they have worked very well in my Mia. You can&#x27;t beat the price and the heads were nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Exactly the same as the you know what brand. Never again will we spend $20 per brush head when options like this are available</li>
    <li> Great price for these brushes that work great.</li>
    <li> AWESOME Brushes!!...just a good /same as the brand name ones! but GREAT Price!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome!!!  They work just like the expensive replacement brushes from Dillard&#x27;s and Ulta; however, I saved lots of money.  I would definitely reorder these again &amp; reorder from this seller.</li>
    <li> I bought these generic replacement brush heads for my Clarasonic Mia2.  I figured for the price for 4 brushes it was worth at least a try.  Well I&#x27;m so glad I did, they are just as good if not better.  I have delicate skin, so I need cleansing brush that is soft and won&#x27;t irritate my face.  These brushes fit the bill, they are super soft.  When I received the brushes (4 pack) I inspected them and compared them to my old Clarasonic brush and they are identical.  I&#x27;ll never buy the brand brushes again!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy these, but they&#x27;re great. They fit  my Mia2 perfectly and I can&#x27;t tell a difference (except for the fact that I got four for half of what one costs!)</li>
    <li> This brush looks and performs just like the one sold specifically for my Mia2.  The only difference is the price.  Ulta sells ONE for $27!  This is WAY better.</li>
    <li> cleans well without hurting delicate skin. Great price.</li>
    <li> I was tentative about how the heck these heads were gonna fit my MIA2, when they sell for $25 each in the store, but THEY ARE PERFECT! They were packaged great and shipped immediately.  Will buy again, but not for a while since I ordered four :)</li>
    <li> I used to shell out twice the amount for just one head at the department store! I can&#x27;t tell any difference between these generic brushes and the original. The only caveat is that the cap for travel and storage seem to be a looser fit, but that was easily remedied by using the cap from the original brushes.</li>
    <li> These replacement brush heads seem to work just as well as the much higher priced brand name that is recommended for my Clarisonic Mia 2.  Very happy with these.</li>
    <li> These scratched my face so bad. I have the legitimate ones and I know they aren&#x27;t that rough. I had to stop using it halfway through my 2 minute time limit on my Clarisonic. AVOID.</li>
    <li> I ordered these generic replacement heads to see how they compared with the &amp;#34;brand name&amp;#34; of the unit.  They are excellent replacements, do a very good job at less than half the cost of the originals.  No doubt about it......I&#x27;ll be getting this generic brand from now on!!!!</li>
    <li> I got the real ones for several times. So when I got this, I can see it&#x27;s fake by just one glance. If you want the low price, it&#x27;s okay. But if you treat your face seriously, I suggest you get the real Clarisonic brush heads, although it might cost you more.</li>
    <li> Love this delicate brushes!! Just like the originals that you pay $24+ for!!! Very soft and I can&#x27;t tell the difference.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Works just as well as expensive brand name. Very pleased with price and speedy delivery. I will purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Used instead of brand name brush heads and they work and feel exactly the same but are much less expensive. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Will never go back to $20 a brush again! Exactly the same as the clarisonic brushes.</li>
    <li> These are not as soft as previous generic brush heads I have purchased on Amazon.  The price is great, but when you have delicate skin, you want the soft and delicate brush heads that FEEL soft and delicate.  These feel stiff.</li>
    <li> These heads fit my clairsonic perfectly, I can tell the bristles are a little harsher.  Sometimes my skin which is a (little sensitive) gets red in the cheek area with these heads, but I think it does a good job on my nose and forehead.  I am a man so I also will go into my beard with them and seems to work well there.</li>
    <li> I always purchase the real clarisonic brush heads and I was hoping for a good deal. I did not get it! These brushes are completely awful. They are badly made and scratched my face. I then tried to return them before the 30 days and the seller wouldn&#x27;t let me. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> Good deal, works like name brand item.</li>
    <li> I am very happy I found these brush heads!!  I normally get the gentle in the name brand for my clairisonic. I ordered these in the Delicate because of the reviews saying they were rougher. I found the Delicate to be the same as the gentle in the names brand ones. They fit perfect the shipping was fast.. the price is wonderful and I will order these for as long as they are available..</li>
    <li> Great job, and they are identical to the super expensive clarisonic brushes.</li>
    <li> A prefect fit for the clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that dries out quickly and easily, especially during the winter. These brush heads were not as soft as other replacement delicate brush heads that I have bought from Amazon, either generic or clarisonic brands. I can not use them because they hurt my face. I have never used the other types of replacement head (sensitive, deep cleansing, or normal) so I can not make any comparisons.</li>
    <li> Great replacement brush heads. Fits unit perfectly. Saves so much money.</li>
    <li> They get the job done, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the same quality of the Clarisonic brand.</li>
    <li> Was nervous when ordering new replacement brush heads that were not the name brand clarasonic but figured what did I have to loose? Turns out I loved them. So soft and just as gentle on the skin. Will definitely be reordering these in the future!</li>
    <li> Very good.  They seem equilivant to the original ones.</li>
    <li> Never again am I going to buy a $25 brush head.  These are exactly like the overpriced ones at the department stores.  I really like the soft bristles of the delicate brush.  The sensitive skin ones were still abrasive and made my skin feel raw.  Sticking to these.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  Shipping was a little sluggish, but I saw that they came all the way from China...so I guess it makes sense.</li>
    <li> The brush heads definitely do not compare to the real Clarisonic brush heads. These are extremely rough and harsh for my skin. I have not used my Clarisonic for a couple weeks now because of original brush heads are old and I&#x27;d rather not use these brush heads at all.</li>
    <li> Will not order anything but true Clarisonic replacements heads. These were like sandpaper on my skin. Went in the trash!!! UGH</li>
    <li> Great value and they work just as well as the name brand.</li>
    <li> Harsh and not the quality of the clarisonic brushes.</li>
    <li> Nice price and works as well as the original</li>
    <li> Worked great.  They scrubbed more than the official Clairsonic brand Sensitive, but worked great for me.  Didn&#x27;t fit as perfectly into the clairsonic as the ones that came with my Clairsonic, but once you get it on works exactly the same.  Saving something close to $20 a pop was worth it to me.  I will be buying an off brand from now on.</li>
    <li> Wow replacement heads  2 for $47 when you can get four of them for what $8 I believe I spent wOW what a difference  thanks Amazon !</li>
    <li> Items arrived well packaged and worked great!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself to have delicate skin but the normal brushes that came with it made my face feel like it was windburn. My face just stung afterwards when I would apply my face cream.  These are nice, smooth &amp; easy on the face; haven&#x27;t had any problems and I feel like that they do just as good as a job</li>
    <li> I must admit that I am guilty of soaking my Clarisonic brush head in dish soap, hydrogen peroxide, and rubbing alcohol just to avoid spending additional money on replacement heads. (Seriously, my Clarisonic purchase was epic in and of itself, since it&#x27;s a product that requires additional product$$$ over the course of time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are AWESOME, they work identical to the higher-priced replacements, and my skin is thanking me. I probably should have switched from the normal to a delicate brush a long time ago, but again, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money. Some people suggested that the delicate brush is TOO delicate for their skin, and the don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s getting as clean as it normally would with a regular brush. I feel just as clean with these. Personally, I want to use my Clarisonic 2x a day, 7 days a week-meaning it can&#x27;t irritate my skin. I couldn&#x27;t do that with the normal brush head because it was way too rough. This one, I am just about there. I wish I had read a review like this, because I would have ordered the even more delicate (luxe, I think?) brush head.</li>
