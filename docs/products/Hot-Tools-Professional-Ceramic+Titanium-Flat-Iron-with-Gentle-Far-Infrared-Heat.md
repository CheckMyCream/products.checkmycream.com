<ol>
      <li>Very pleased!</li>
      <li>Great tool, does the job well.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>and I loved the product then, recommended by my good friend who just happens to be my beautician as well.  </li>
      <li>It took forever to warm up.  </li>
      <li>It heats up quick &amp; does its job GREATLY...</li>
      <li>I got this one thinking that the quality of hot tools was great no matter the price,</li>
      <li>Products works ok but not as stated</li>
      <li>I love this brand.</li>
      <li>Heats up fast and works very nicely on my hair.</li>
      <li>The flat iron is perfect size for my fine hair and tends to be frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>The quality is just as great but and price was fair and half</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>I love hot tools brand</li>
      <li>I thought about buying another one, since it DID do a great job for awhile there, but I figured I&#x27;d be better off buying a more expensive, better quality one from my salon.  </li>
      <li>It made my hair full</li>
      <li>This flat iron did not do a good job at all.</li>
      <li>I have pretty fine hair</li>
      <li>Hopefully my experience will get better once I use it a little more!</li>
      <li>but after a few weeks it started working great.  </li>
      <li>Heats quickly - right size.</li>
      <li>The first was purchased in a beauty salon</li>
      <li>At first it wasn&#x27;t heating up as well as I thought it should</li>
      <li>Does not stay hot.</li>
      <li>and so I ventured to try this Hot Tools straightener.</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>I have used hot tools in the past and loved them.</li>
      <li>Gets hot fast and stays hot.</li>
      <li>o static and was not soft or shiny like</li>
      <li>I used it often for about 8-10 months (with no damage, only smooth, straight results)</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up and work very well.</li>
      <li>and it really smooths it out while straightening.</li>
      <li>and it was very embarrasing for me...</li>
      <li>I paid way too much for this.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased that I can find items like this on Amazon.com and the price was much less than what I had paid for the first one purchased in a salon.</li>
      <li>It is a great tool for reducing frizz from naturally curly hair and does not damage my hair like previous flat irons I have owned.</li>
      <li>The main reason I bought</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this item.  </li>
      <li>I bought this as my first flat iron, I&#x27;d never used one before and didn&#x27;t really know much about them.  </li>
      <li>They only last about a year or so before they break, but they make your hair so smooth and sleek.</li>
      <li>It just did not get hot enough is what i think was the problem.</li>
      <li>Works fine, gets hot initially, but I have to let it sit for a couple seconds between sections of hair because it cools down with each section then heats back up.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair multiple times with it, just one pass &amp; its straight...</li>
      <li>I have naturally dry/curly/frizzy hair</li>
      <li>Doesnt really &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; the hair which makes for multiple go overs.</li>
      <li>Wish it had heat choices of numbers or degrees - this tool has neither - just a wheel of low to high.</li>
      <li>When my last flat iron broke, hot tools was the brand i wanted.</li>
      <li>I have two of these flat irons one i purchased at full retail from ulta for $35.00 and the other I got on sale at</li>
      <li>I have pretty wavy and unruly hair naturally, and previously I had been using just a straightener I bought for $15-20 at the drug store.</li>
      <li>Now my hair was already blown out and straightened from getting my hair done earlier in the day, but it took me multiple times going over the same strand to just touch up certain spots.</li>
      <li>I have gone through MULTIPLE flat iron/hair straighteners &amp; so far this is BY FAR my FAVE!</li>
      <li>This is the second Hot Tools Professional 1&amp;#34; wide flat iron I have purchased.  </li>

<li> Didn&#x27;t last long.</li>

<li> I travel with one and the other is for daily use.</li>
<li> Came in a box that was all taped up and looked not new.</li>
<li> At least then I knew I wouldn&#x27;t possibly have to buy ANOTHER in a few months when the new one stopped working.</li>
<li> I have had one of my Irons for about 4 or 5 years and the other I have had for 3 years.</li>
<li> All that infrarred crap, and the healthy and silky hair is just a lie, the purple coat you see in there</li>
<li> I would like it a little hotter since I have such thick, wavy hair, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
<li> and it still took quite  few times over and over to straiten it.</li>
<li> Design is not comfortable ro hold.</li>
<li> Needless to say I took it back.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up ... very big disappointment !</li>
<li> I have very thick hair, so this one might work for someone with thinner hair.</li>
<li> Not happy with product</li>
<li> There is nothing wrong with either of these Irons.</li>
<li> WRONG!</li>

    <li> I have gone through MULTIPLE flat iron/hair straighteners &amp; so far this is BY FAR my FAVE! It heats up quick &amp; does its job GREATLY...I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair multiple times with it, just one pass &amp; its straight...</li>
    <li> I have two of these flat irons one i purchased at full retail from ulta for $35.00 and the other I got on sale at Sally&#x27;s I believe. I love this brand. There is nothing wrong with either of these Irons. I have had one of my Irons for about 4 or 5 years and the other I have had for 3 years. Both Irons work well. I travel with one and the other is for daily use. Great product. I plan on purchasing another Iron as soon as they go on sale again.</li>
    <li> My hair gets stuck in the plates. I thought it was how I was using it but I see others have had the same issue. I prefer my smaller iron by Revlon.</li>
    <li> All that infrarred crap, and the healthy and silky hair is just a lie, the purple coat you see in there starts chipping off after 3 months of buying it, the iron starts overheating and after several months your hair looks like trash, I bought it as a gift and it was very embarrasing for me...</li>
    <li> Products works ok but not as stated</li>
    <li> Heats quickly - right size. Let&#x27;s see how long it lasts... so far so good. It travels well. Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this as my first flat iron, I&#x27;d never used one before and didn&#x27;t really know much about them.  The main reason I bought it was because of the low price, and I guess you get what you pay for.  At first it wasn&#x27;t heating up as well as I thought it should but after a few weeks it started working great.  I used it often for about 8-10 months (with no damage, only smooth, straight results) and then I noticed the purple paint started cracking/chipping in some places.  That eventually spread to the opposite plate, so both had spots where it was just metal-on-metal contact.  Then about a month after that, one side of the iron just stopped working all together.  I thought about buying another one, since it DID do a great job for awhile there, but I figured I&#x27;d be better off buying a more expensive, better quality one from my salon.  At least then I knew I wouldn&#x27;t possibly have to buy ANOTHER in a few months when the new one stopped working.</li>
    <li> The smoke smelled like burnt electronic parts. Was immediately unplugged and returned.</li>
    <li> Bought this iron at Ulta.  It took forever to warm up.  I paid way too much for this. It made my hair full o static and was not soft or shiny like it was advertised.  Needless to say I took it back.</li>
    <li> I have pretty wavy and unruly hair naturally, and previously I had been using just a straightener I bought for $15-20 at the drug store. The ceramic coating though was peeling and so I ventured to try this Hot Tools straightener. I&#x27;ve only used it once, so I&#x27;m still testing all the features out, but I found that I had to turn the heat almost to the maximum number just to make a dent in my hair. Now my hair was already blown out and straightened from getting my hair done earlier in the day, but it took me multiple times going over the same strand to just touch up certain spots. Hopefully my experience will get better once I use it a little more!</li>
    <li> Came in a box that was all taped up and looked not new. Doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up and work very well.</li>
    <li> I have pretty fine hair and it still took quite  few times over and over to straiten it. Not happy with product</li>
    <li> Does not stay hot. Design is not comfortable ro hold. Doesnt really &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; the hair which makes for multiple go overs.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is perfect size for my fine hair and tends to be frizzy hair.  Gets hot fast and stays hot.</li>
    <li> This item works well! Very pleased! I have naturally dry/curly/frizzy hair and it really smooths it out while straightening. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great tool, does the job well. Wish it had heat choices of numbers or degrees - this tool has neither - just a wheel of low to high. Its also smaller than I thought and hoped (length).</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and works very nicely on my hair.</li>
    <li> Works fine, gets hot initially, but I have to let it sit for a couple seconds between sections of hair because it cools down with each section then heats back up. I would like it a little hotter since I have such thick, wavy hair, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> I have used hot tools in the past and loved them. When my last flat iron broke, hot tools was the brand i wanted. I got this one thinking that the quality of hot tools was great no matter the price, WRONG! This flat iron did not do a good job at all. I have very thick hair, so this one might work for someone with thinner hair. It just did not get hot enough is what i think was the problem. I ended up getting a $50 Con Air product from KMART and it worked wonders.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I&#x27;ve owned three. They only last about a year or so before they break, but they make your hair so smooth and sleek.</li>
    <li> I love hot tools brand but this did not work!  Doesn&#x27;t heat up ... very big disappointment !</li>
    <li> This is the second Hot Tools Professional 1&amp;#34; wide flat iron I have purchased.  The first was purchased in a beauty salon and I loved the product then, recommended by my good friend who just happens to be my beautician as well.  I am so pleased that I can find items like this on Amazon.com and the price was much less than what I had paid for the first one purchased in a salon. The quality is just as great but and price was fair and half the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this item.  It is a great tool for reducing frizz from naturally curly hair and does not damage my hair like previous flat irons I have owned.</li>

    <li> Seemed to make my hair frizzyer and I&#x27;m use to my chi that was crapping out so I got this and didn&#x27;t like it one bit.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last long. Started peeling to soon.</li>
