      <li>Very good at removing eye make-up.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think that these will make a great solution for me when I travel</li>

      <li>The oil version is great</li>
      <li>Try them out everyone - they are great</li>
      <li>Almay is a good product....</li>
      <li>Why wash one moisturizer away just to put more of something else on afterward?!  </li>
      <li>They both remove eye makeup equally effectively.</li>
      <li>This product, best used in the evening, takes the mascara off without too much effort and does leave you with an oily feel/residue, but look at it this way, the oil moisturizes and nourishes your skin, rub it in and embrace it.</li>
      <li>Have used these for years, they are the best way to remove mascara and yet be gentle on your eyes</li>
      <li>To each his own.</li>
      <li>I was excited about what a great buy these were, but I won&#x27;t be buying them again.  </li>
      <li>The oil free ones are great and I will have to make sure never to get the moisturing one again.</li>
      <li>yes, it is oily because that&#x27;s what removes waterproof makeup easily!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other makeup removers but this one works the best for me when trying to remove any kind of eye makeup!</li>
      <li>Love Love Love these pads!  </li>
      <li>The regular almay pads are wonderful ,I will stick with those</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not found anything better than this product.</li>
      <li>I ordered this and got the oil free version!</li>
      <li>They do the job much better.</li>
      <li>I think I like the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; version better.  </li>
      <li>I use it in the mornings too, just be sure you put contact lenses (if you wear them)</li>
      <li>Takes off eye makeup and mascara very easily while leaving a light film of oil to soften the skin around the eye.  </li>
      <li>Overall a very good product.</li>
      <li>I use a paper towel or strong tissue to wipe the residue off.</li>
      <li>For those that were sensitive to the product to the point of burning, yeah, this might not be a good fit, but hey, that&#x27;s why they offer a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; alternative.</li>
      <li>but your eyes are greasy and you need to make sure you do a good washing with SOAP &amp; WATER , otherwise the feeling stays around for way too long.</li>
      <li>Every time I used them to clean off my eye makeup</li>
      <li>Even more impressive was that I used only a single pad for both eyes!  </li>
      <li>For my upcoming travel, I&#x27;ll take them with me and use them right before bed...</li>
      <li>these pads are so convenient and gentle and work great with little to no rubbing... just easily wipe across the area, use a soft tissue to pick up the remains and you&#x27;re done!&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very convenient, but super greasy.</li>
      <li>I love how well it removes regular and waterproof mascara!..</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s no big deal, but I think I prefer the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; version better because of this.  </li>
      <li>I have used Almay eye makeup remover pads for the last 15 years or more.</li>
      <li>and I think the work pretty much the sam .</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
      <li>The real problem with these pads is that I took off my make-up over an hour ago and my eyes are still foggy.  </li>
      <li>However, this really isn&#x27;t the biggest issue.  </li>
      <li>The cleaning solution is very oily.  </li>
      <li>It was also VERY oily.</li>
      <li>they remove eye makeup without too much oil</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t care for this particular item.  </li>
      <li>These ones are a little more oily and because that oil is thicker, it can stay on my lashes and sting a bit.  </li>
      <li>The shower and your face washing regiment ought to clear out the oily residue....</li>
      <li>The oil-free requires too much rubbing, which can cause undo eyelash loss and can ultimately cause wrinkles in the sensitive eye areas.</li>
      <li>in AFTER you clear your eyes of the oils.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t wear my contacts for nearly a week.</li>
      <li>The first time around they are very oily, but with the 2nd and 3rd use, if I get a 3rd use out of a pad, the oil is almost gone.</li>
      <li>I keep it in my makeup bag and use it to remove my eye makeup several times before I toss it for a new one.</li>
      <li>No other eye makeup remover pad gets the job done like this one..  </li>
      <li>For the price these will last me a longg time, so I think it was a decent purchase overall</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t seem to be very thick pads, but they hold enough product for more than enough make-up removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>good news is that everything came off quickly other than the waterproof liner and mascara, which required a bit more scrubbing, but wasn&#x27;t horrible.  </li>
      <li>Paper towels are strong and don&#x27;t leave crumbs behind like some tissues.  </li>

<li> I wear long wearing and waterproof mascara.</li>
<li> All except for 2 pads in the bottom were completely dry.</li>
<li> And don&#x27;t dry out the skin around your eyes or irritate the skin.  </li>
<li> The first time around, the towel is rough and tough but it gets softer with use.</li>
<li> I got them today and immediately put them to the test removing my very heavy make-up, which is a layering of products starting with eye cream, primer, a couple of shades of \\&quot;blended\\&quot; eyeshadow,waterproof eye-liner and mascara, all covered with Urban Decay&#x27;s spray</li>
<li> I accidentally got the moisturizing pads and they are horrible, they remove the make up great</li>
<li> I will not be using them on a daily basis, but they did remove the make-up while leaving my skin (excessively) moist.  </li>
<li> and then I flipped it over and used the other side with no problem.  </li>
<li> I know there are several negative reviews here, but if you are 30 something</li>
<li> I like also the way it hydrates my eyes all night, with less puffiness in the morning..</li>
<li> This is just oil on a little pad.  </li>
<li> I bought these make-up removal pads because I travel frequently for business and am very tired of my make-up remover taking up valuable space in my quart-sized plastic baggie.  </li>
<li> I discourage using toilet paper, too abrasive, not durable and leaves crumbs behind.</li>
<li> I personally don&#x27;t mind this as I don&#x27;t have oily skin or live in a humid climate, so I can use all of the moisturizing I can get, but this could really be annoying if you weren&#x27;t expecting it.  </li>
<li> Although my eye makeup is removed not real happy with the oil left behind</li>
<li> bad part is that they&#x27;re really oily.  </li>
<li> The pads are way too small and they leave an oily residue.  </li>
<li> I had blurry vision for at least 20 minutes afterwards.  </li>
<li> This was a big disappointment.</li>
<li> My eyes started burning and tearing so badly that I couldn&#x27;t even keep my eyes open.</li>
<li> it is very hard to remove.</li>
<li> Seems to work well but leaves behind an oily greasy feeling.</li>
<li> I have bad bad bad allergies, and I realized that I really need to start paying attention to how I handle these allergies to my eyes, lest I end up with these tired looking eyes forever...</li>
<li> I was unable to use any of the product.</li>
<li> It even removes false lashes and the adhesive with ease!</li>
<li> I purchased this in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift Eye Moisturizer because I have been experiencing baggy tired looking eyes out of no where!!!!  </li>
<li> And the worst part is it doesn&#x27;t even take my mascara off.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>

    <li> This was a big disappointment. I thought Almay would make a excellentquality product. I used this for 3 days and then my eyes starting tearing and burning. I couldn&#x27;t wear my contacts for nearly a week. It was also VERY oily. I would not, could not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!...I love how well it removes regular and waterproof mascara!..It even removes false lashes and the adhesive with ease! I&#x27;ve used other makeup removers but this one works the best for me when trying to remove any kind of eye makeup!</li>
    <li> I think I like the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; version better.  These ones are a little more oily and because that oil is thicker, it can stay on my lashes and sting a bit.  I just rinse my face after removing my makeup, so it&#x27;s no big deal, but I think I prefer the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; version better because of this.  They both remove eye makeup equally effectively.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who needs eye makeup remover pads.  I have used them for years and have tried others but always come back.  Try them out everyone - they are great</li>
    <li> These pads take off all my eye makeup.  I wear a lot of mascara and this gets it all off.</li>
    <li> Excellent product..  No other eye makeup remover pad gets the job done like this one..  A+++++, thumbs up all the way.</li>
    <li> Almay is a good product....I just don&#x27;t care for this particular item.  The pads are way too small and they leave an oily residue.  I&#x27;m going back to my Neutrogena pads.  They do the job much better.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love these pads!  Takes off eye makeup and mascara very easily while leaving a light film of oil to soften the skin around the eye.  I have used these for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> I bought these make-up removal pads because I travel frequently for business and am very tired of my make-up remover taking up valuable space in my quart-sized plastic baggie.  I got them today and immediately put them to the test removing my very heavy make-up, which is a layering of products starting with eye cream, primer, a couple of shades of \\&quot;blended\\&quot; eyeshadow,waterproof eye-liner and mascara, all covered with Urban Decay&#x27;s spray finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that everything came off quickly other than the waterproof liner and mascara, which required a bit more scrubbing, but wasn&#x27;t horrible.  Even more impressive was that I used only a single pad for both eyes!  One side for one eye, and then I flipped it over and used the other side with no problem.  They don&#x27;t seem to be very thick pads, but they hold enough product for more than enough make-up removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad part is that they&#x27;re really oily.  I personally don&#x27;t mind this as I don&#x27;t have oily skin or live in a humid climate, so I can use all of the moisturizing I can get, but this could really be annoying if you weren&#x27;t expecting it.  However, this really isn&#x27;t the biggest issue.  The real problem with these pads is that I took off my make-up over an hour ago and my eyes are still foggy.  I don&#x27;t know why it went into my eyes and won&#x27;t come out.  I didn&#x27;t go to any extra lengths to squeeze the pads, I kept my eyes shut the entire time I was using them, and I washed my face off with facial wash and water immediately afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I didn&#x27;t think that these will make a great solution for me when I travel, I would have probably given them 2 stars.. and I may come back and post an update if I can&#x27;t figure out how to make them work.  I will not be using them on a daily basis, but they did remove the make-up while leaving my skin (excessively) moist.  For my upcoming travel, I&#x27;ll take them with me and use them right before bed... then keep my eyes shut for the night so it doesn&#x27;t bother me that I can&#x27;t get the product out of my eyes.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
    <li> Very good at removing eye make-up. You may want to wipe off the extra, as these tend to leave a lot of the remover fluid on your skin. Overall a very good product.</li>
    <li> All except for 2 pads in the bottom were completely dry. I was unable to use any of the product.</li>
    <li> I accidentally got the moisturizing pads and they are horrible, they remove the make up great but your eyes are greasy and you need to make sure you do a good washing with SOAP &amp; WATER , otherwise the feeling stays around for way too long. The regular almay pads are wonderful ,I will stick with those</li>
    <li> Seems to work well but leaves behind an oily greasy feeling.Although my eye makeup is removed not real happy with the oil left behind it is very hard to remove.</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Before I got these pads, I used the nuetrogena bottled version and I think the work pretty much the sam . For the price these will last me a longg time, so I think it was a decent purchase overall</li>
    <li> I ordered this and got the oil free version! Does not remove the makeup and makes eyes burn! The oil version is great but this one doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Have used these for years, they are the best way to remove mascara and yet be gentle on your eyes</li>
    <li> I have used Almay eye makeup remover pads for the last 15 years or more. They do the job and don&#x27;t irritate my eyes. Like just about anything, Amazon has the best price!</li>
    <li> I wear long wearing and waterproof mascara. I&#x27;ve not found anything better than this product. The oil-free requires too much rubbing, which can cause undo eyelash loss and can ultimately cause wrinkles in the sensitive eye areas. This product, best used in the evening, takes the mascara off without too much effort and does leave you with an oily feel/residue, but look at it this way, the oil moisturizes and nourishes your skin, rub it in and embrace it. The next morning your eyes will thank you for it!  I use it in the mornings too, just be sure you put contact lenses (if you wear them) in AFTER you clear your eyes of the oils. Why not use the product before you shower?  The shower and your face washing regiment ought to clear out the oily residue....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my method. I use the pads several times before I toss them. The first time around they are very oily, but with the 2nd and 3rd use, if I get a 3rd use out of a pad, the oil is almost gone. I use a paper towel or strong tissue to wipe the residue off. I don&#x27;t always wash it away with soap and water because it truly does moisturize. Why wash one moisturizer away just to put more of something else on afterward?!  To each his own. Oh yeah the paper towel thing?  They too get several uses. The first time around, the towel is rough and tough but it gets softer with use. I keep it in my makeup bag and use it to remove my eye makeup several times before I toss it for a new one. Paper towels are strong and don&#x27;t leave crumbs behind like some tissues.  I discourage using toilet paper, too abrasive, not durable and leaves crumbs behind. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck ladies! I know there are several negative reviews here, but if you are 30 something there&#x27;s no reason why oil should be your enemy.  For those that were sensitive to the product to the point of burning, yeah, this might not be a good fit, but hey, that&#x27;s why they offer a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; alternative.</li>
    <li> This is just oil on a little pad.  It&#x27;s disgusting. And the worst part is it doesn&#x27;t even take my mascara off. I&#x27;m just wiping oil all over my eyes. The oil free ones are great and I will have to make sure never to get the moisturing one again.</li>
    <li> I was excited about what a great buy these were, but I won&#x27;t be buying them again.  The cleaning solution is very oily.  Every time I used them to clean off my eye makeup I had blurry vision for at least 20 minutes afterwards.  I gave the product a 2 because it did get my eye makeup off, I just couldn&#x27;t see the results until after my vision cleared.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very convenient, but super greasy.</li>
    <li> they remove eye makeup without too much oil</li>
    <li> yes, it is oily because that&#x27;s what removes waterproof makeup easily!  these pads are so convenient and gentle and work great with little to no rubbing... just easily wipe across the area, use a soft tissue to pick up the remains and you&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve never used them then tried to reapply eye makeup, but can see how that might be a challenge because they do leave a residue-- i use them at night before bed--  always buy these and have had no problems at all!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift Eye Moisturizer because I have been experiencing baggy tired looking eyes out of no where!!!!  I have bad bad bad allergies, and I realized that I really need to start paying attention to how I handle these allergies to my eyes, lest I end up with these tired looking eyes forever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these moisturizing pads every night and the eye makeup comes off immediately, with awesome moisturization along with.  Almay claims to be hypoallergenic, and from the products I have used I would have to say they are telling the truth.  I like also the way it hydrates my eyes all night, with less puffiness in the morning..</li>
    <li> They actually work!  And don&#x27;t dry out the skin around your eyes or irritate the skin.  They&#x27;re especially great for the gym or when you travel.  Although honestly, I use them every night - they&#x27;re perfect for eyeliner.</li>
    <li> My eyes started burning and tearing so badly that I couldn&#x27;t even keep my eyes open. Stick with the oil-free pads.</li>
