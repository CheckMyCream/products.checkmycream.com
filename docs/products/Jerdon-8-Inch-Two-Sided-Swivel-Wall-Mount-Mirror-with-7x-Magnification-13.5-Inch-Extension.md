      <li>It is even nicer than the picture and wonderful for all us ladies with wild eyelashes growing here and there...</li>
      <li>I should have measured how far it would have to reach to be perfect for my needs.</li>
      <li>Another added benefit is that you can swivel the mirror and use it in conjunction with your large bathroom mirror to see all angles of your face and rear - which is great for checking your hair and how your clothes are fitting!  </li>
      <li>This mirror is beautiful and very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good, steady mount for a mirror with good resolution.  </li>
      <li>This is a great mirror for the price ~ I found many lessor mirrors for a higher price.  </li>
      <li>So I took a risk on this one and was completely satisfied.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve had this in my bathroom for YEARS - loved it.  Everyone in the family used it.  We just moved and I left this behind for the new home owners.  I went thru my Amazon account, past orders and found this and re-ordered it.  It&#x27;s the first thing we put up in the bathroom of our new house.  Glad I was able to order the same one again!!!</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a good make up mirror like we had in some of our motel stays, and she is verrrrry happy with this one. Turns out, it is great for shaving  and I love it too.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Chrismas gift and have not yet seen it installed but I was very impressed with look of the frame, the construction, and the clarity of the mirror at both the regular magification and the 7x. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 85 year old Mom and she loves it. She can see much better when putting on makeup etc.</li>
    <li> This mirror is just great if you want to see enough detail that you would never dream of leaving your house.  However, I spent a long time with the tweezers and it is fantastic for that.  It was easy to instill, took a drill on my cement walls and is very sturdy using only the screws and stuff supplied.  If you think there are no screws, you haven&#x27;t looked in the secret spot under the cardboard.  I love this!!!  You don&#x27;t need a lighted one.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a wonderful addition to my over-all peace of mind...It was a breeze to install and the mirrors are distortion free. And I can not begin to tell you, how wonderful it is not to be driving along and find un-wanted , and before hand not seen, facial hair..Thank you Amazon for carrying such a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for the price ~ I found many lessor mirrors for a higher price.  It has high magnification and since it has a moveable arm, I can move it around to take advantage of the light and the height of the person using it.</li>
    <li> This mirror looks reasonably good, and was easy to mount.    The non-magnifying side of my mirror had a slight defect toward an edge.  Due to the small size of the defect and the fact this mirror was bought primarily for the magnifying side, this problem has been viewed as minor.    The magnifying side has subtle ripples.  This can be noticed when moving one&#x27;s face very slowly up and down, or side to side.  The face will barely distort like a mirror would do in a fun-house.  To be fair for the price, this mirror should not be considered a fine optical device.  The distortion is not distracting, and one can still use the mirror for close work as intended.    I think this mirror is just fine for an average user.  But serious critics may be more satisfied with a more expensive mirror.</li>
    <li> The thing just felt and looked cheap and flimsy.  I know they provide the dimensions, but I didn&#x27;t take the time to measure so the arm also was shorter than what I was expecting.  Wifey also hated it.  Returned.</li>
    <li> Like many of the reviewers, I had used a mirror like this at a hotel and wanted one for my own bathroom. The reviews were positive and it wasn&#x27;t to pricey, so I figured, why not? When I opened the box and read the directions I was disappointed that the drill bit size wasn&#x27;t specified. I couldn&#x27;t find it on the manufacturers&#x27; web site either. It took me several tries to get the right drill bit, which meant that I put several unneeded holes in my bathroom wall. When I did find the right size drill bit and lightly tapped the anchors into the wall, they cracked and bent back. The mirror is on my wall now and I managed to cover the extra holes with the mounting plate, but every time I use the mirror, I have to be careful not to pull it off the wall. It&#x27;s only a matter of time before I have to get new anchors and rehang it, as well as patch the holes and repaint. The mirror itself is fine. Just be careful and use a 3/16\\&quot; drill bit!</li>
    <li> This replaced my previous 1X/3X mirror - I couldn&#x27;t even see a hair on my chinny chin chin.  The 1X/7X is wonderful - I really thought I needed a lighted mirror but did not have an outlet - this mirror did the trick!  The clarity is great - I can see even without my glasses!   One reviewer mentioned there were&#x27;n screws - I thought so too... but I found them (with anchors) when I was tearing down the box.</li>
    <li> this is a great wall mount mirror - easy to put up - and I now can see when I put on my eye makeup and pluck eyebrows!!</li>
    <li> Love this.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older it has become a challenge to do things without my glasses and putting make up on was one of them.  We had one attached to the mirror but it meant bending over to look into it.  This was the answer I needed.  Lazy maybe but it sure was a pain in the butt to have to lean over to put my make up on.  This pulls away from the way enough to stand straight up when standing at the counter and I don&#x27;t have to bend.  It rotates in all directions so I can look into it will all different types of light.</li>
    <li> This mirror has met all my expectations.  Easy to mount excellent reflective properties.  The magnifying part serves its purpose well, especially for my wife&#x27;s poor eyesight.  Reasonably priced.  Big bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror.  I fell in love with a similar one in a hotel room and had to have one for my own bathroom.  It was easy to install and looks great.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this mirror.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with this mirror, except that it doesn&#x27;t reach far enough for me to use as I&#x27;d like.  I should have measured how far it would have to reach to be perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> Every time I stay at hotels that have these swing arm magnifying mirrors I vow to buy one.  Amazon had the best price for this magnification.  It&#x27;s of good quality and and I&#x27;m quite happy wth it.  Eyebrow shaping and mascara applications are so much easier!</li>
    <li> Was a little larger than I expected, but that was my own fault for not measuring...  High quality;  easy to install;  mirror is very clear;  magnification is ideal;  attractive mirror.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent quality mirror; exactly what I needed.  I purchased the 5X for my husband and he is very happy with his, too!</li>
    <li> We are extremely happy with our 7X mirror..It was easy to mount ,however the plastic expanding screw shields were not tappered. They were straight and when put in the wall they go straight through to the inside of the sheetrock...I replaced them with tappered shields so they would expand when you put the screw into it..</li>
    <li> Had for a couple years now. Quality is good, but not real top end. Has served well in main bath room. Mounted easily and articulates where needed</li>
    <li> I used this in an up-scale hotel and looked for the brand and product number on it.  I knew I had to have this in my new bathroom.  It is even nicer than the picture and wonderful for all us ladies with wild eyelashes growing here and there...like our chins...Love it.  Viv</li>
    <li> This mirror is beautiful and very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7X magnification makes putting on make-up like mascara much easier for a near sighted person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the look and the utility of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerdon JP7507CB 8-Inch Two-Sided Swivel Wall Mount Mirror with 7x Magnification, 13.5-Inch Extension, Chrome Beaded Finish</li>
    <li> Beautiful mirror.  The 7x strength meets my needs as well as he normal reflection.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I use it daily and are very pleased.</li>
    <li> Purchased this earlier this year and it&#x27;s still a solid unit (not falling apart).  Easy to install.  The 7x mirror magnification is perfect for my aging eyes.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This mirror was used in an apt where the vanity mirror was too far away for applying make-up. AFter looking at nearly every mirror of this type, I&#x27;m so glad we chose this one, as it not only looks great (closes flat to the wall &amp; not bulky)) but is super useful in turning every way possible, giving you every angle you need for hair and make-up. This was for my mom who is a senior citizen, and she LOVES it! But everyone that sees it wants one, and would be perfect for teens or college students too. It takes up little space, is classy looking, and a bargain price for it&#x27;s quality and usefulness!</li>
    <li> Like most of the others, I realized this type of wall-mount mirror is a must-have after a stay in an upscale hotel.  In the hotel, the mirror was mounted eye-level next to the the sink.  The vanity lighting was adequate to illuminate my face, so there is no need for the lighted mirrors.  It makes tweezing much less of a chore since you don&#x27;t have to bend over or hold a mirror, and I&#x27;ve never applied mascara and eyeliner so beautifully before!  Another added benefit is that you can swivel the mirror and use it in conjunction with your large bathroom mirror to see all angles of your face and rear - which is great for checking your hair and how your clothes are fitting!  To top it off, the mirror compactly folds away and doesn&#x27;t add to the clutter on your vanity top!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Jerdon mirror in and was immediately impressed by the weight of it.  It doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made.  Each swivel point has a screw slot on the underneath side, so you can tighten them if you ever need to, and you won&#x27;t have to worry about the rods sagging over time.  (The hotel mirror didn&#x27;t have this type of adjustment and there was a lot of slop in the joints).  I can&#x27;t say how the finish will hold up over time since I&#x27;ve just gotten in it, but I am hopeful I won&#x27;t have any issues.  Even if I do, this mirror was inexpensive enough that I wouldn&#x27;t hesistate to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation is a snap.  There is a base plate you mount to the wall (a stud is preferred if you have one available). You then mount the mirror on top of the base plate and tighten down the screws you see on the left and right in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is really a must have for any bathroom!  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone so long without this simply luxury!</li>
    <li> I travel all over and love these mirrors in hotel bathrooms. So i ordered this one for home. Great item ! I call it my \\&quot;WRINKLE WATCHER\\&quot;!  When ever my daughter or sister visit they are usually in my bathroom closely examining the latest wrinkle, blemish or tweezing eyebrows. I&#x27;m buying them both their own for Christmas complete with their OWN tweezers..... I love this item because i can apply make up without using my reading glasses, I don&#x27;t have to lean over the sink and it folds flat against the wall when you are finished with it. Also, very easy to install.</li>
    <li> I needed a mirror that I could really see close up and this is it.  Very clear almost shows too much if you know what I mean but that is what I needed.  I wish the arm was longer but it does what I needed.  Very nice quality.  Great Price.</li>
    <li> My order came in a timely manor, packaging was solid and installation was a snap. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap for the $40.00 I paid. I wish the outer edge design of the 7-X mirror was also on the opposite side. It would have been nice to have it come in additional finishes (pewter, brass, bronze) for the same price.</li>
    <li> It is so pretty looks like it costs A lot more you can realy see to put on your make up that is why I got it just love it</li>
    <li> This is a great Wall Mirror, also a great price! Easy to install, and a super customer service! Yes I have recommended this product to friends and it is just what it is called JERDON FIRST CLASS WALL MIRROR!</li>
    <li> They had one of these mirrors in a 5 star hotel that my husband and I stayed at and I fell in love with it! I HAD TO HAVE ONE OF MY OWN and thanks to Amazon I was able to find one. This is an EXCELLENT product. My husband installed it easily and I would never be without one again. One side is magnified and my eyebrows have never looked so good, lol, and eyelining is a breeze. Though he would never admit it, my husband uses also (trimming mustash, nose hairs (eewww), shaving, etc.) &lt;br /&gt;Great product. Order one. You will not be dissapointed!!</li>
    <li> A good-looking, quality, well-made product. We have one in another bathroom that has worked well for more than 10 years.</li>
    <li> I had this installed by remodeling contractor, and he could not get it to sit flush to the wall.  I have to be careful opening and closing it.  Also, it does not extend far enough,  I wish it came out about two more inches.</li>
    <li> This mirror is really great the only problem is that it is a little unstable.  I feel like I have to be really careful with it or it will pull out of the wall.  But...I really like it and would recommend it to anyone and will probably be getting one for my mom for her birthday.</li>
    <li> And I haven&#x27;t used it for a long enough time to make a decision on the pudding yet.  It magnifies... big time.  You will see things up your nose that scare you to  death!  The cracks and wrinkles you see on your face will put some into a depression.  It&#x27;s pretty, and it seems a bit lightly constructed around the base.  Once attached to the wall  though, it&#x27;s sturdy.  I think it will do the job... now if you&#x27;ll excuse me I have some major tweezing to do.  :-)</li>
    <li> Found something similar at a high end resort. Hunted around.  Design very well except for the mounting anchors and screws.  We didn&#x27;t have the wall space so he used silicone to mount to the mirror. Wants another for guest bath.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to my bathroom! I love it. Makes applying makeup a \\&quot;must\\&quot;! Just be sure to attach it a little higher than your head so you won&#x27;t bump into it at the wash basin! The tilt and swing arm are very good features. I highly recommend this product and delivery was exceptional.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror. It is solidly made. The quality of the mirror is very good for the price. The magnification is perfect for applying makeup. Mounting was simple. I am so pleased I bought a second one for anotehr bathroom.</li>
    <li> My mirror arrived quickly, was easy to install, and makes putting on my makeup a breeze.  I would recommend this product for everyone!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  I ordered the 5x and used it for a couple of months.  I had to move around to get the right angle but could never find that \\&quot;exact spot.\\&quot;  My daughter is in her early forties and she could use the mirror comfortably.  I gave it to her and ordered the 7x which is perfect for a senior citizen like me.  I recommend it to anyone that has a hard time putting on make-up.</li>
    <li> Product seems just as advertised. Very attractive and easy use on either side. My husband and I both enjoy it&#x27;s convenience. Mounting took only minutes and leaves our bathroom counter clutter free.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my bathroom. It was easy to install and only took me a few minutes. It is a very pretty mirror. It is great for inserting contact lenses or putting on makeup or plucking your eyebrows. I can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about this mirror. I love it.</li>
    <li> Tried a Jerdon mirror in a hotel I stayed at, loved it so much I bought one for my home.  Excellent shaving mirror.  All of their mirrors are first-rate, buy this one or another that suits your purposes.</li>
    <li> Just as the other reviews say, this mirror works wonderfully and is comparable in quality to similar mirrors in hotels like The Four Seasons.  (I looked up the price of the brand at one hotel and it was 3 times as much as this mirror).    I can finally put on my makeup without my glasses on and see what I&#x27;m doing!</li>
    <li> Hi quality for the price; lets my baby boomer eyes see things I don&#x27;t really want to now about.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Jerdon wall mount mirror about a month ago and I love it. The 7x magnification can be a bit much at first but you adjust to it and then you wonder how you managed without it. Initially I thought I needed a lighted mirror but this is mounted next to my regular bathroom mirror with a good light fixture over it so having enough light is not an issue. The construction is very good and it was quite easy to put up.</li>
    <li> The clarity of the mirror is great but what I like the most is the  ability to both adjust the mirror and store it flat against the wall when not being used.    Price was also excellent for the  quality.</li>
    <li> I finally got around to mounting this. I am not happy. First the wall anchors that come with it. I&#x27;ve never seen any like it. They spin in the wall. I finally got it up and it was crooked. I even had plumbed it with a level but it was way off. took it down to plumb it more carefully, but made the hole to close to the other one and drywall failed. I moved it over a bit. Now I have 2 holes to patch. Mounted it again with the level and it still came out crooked. Then I noticed the holes in the mounting plate are crooked. It is pretty obvious. Check to see if your holes are level before you mount it. I took to long to get around to installing it. Now my window for complete refund has expired. Can Amazon or Jerdon please send me a good one?</li>
    <li> My girlfriend found it for my bathroom, and it was really easy to install and the thing is pretty well made:-) Thank you for a great product, Amazon seller!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  I put it up on the wall in my bathroom and now I don&#x27;t have to stoop over and put my makeup on.  It&#x27;s right at my height level and I love it.  I have adjusted it so I don&#x27;t have to move it around much and it looks great.  I did not need a light on the mirror just more magnification.  I would recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> This item is perfect for anyone but especially for me because I have a vision impairment and I have a bad back which will not allow me to lean in over the counter top in order to get close enough to the mirror to see what I am doing. With this mirror I can adjust it to come right out to my face making my life much easier and pain free. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works great for me. It pulls out from the wall easy &amp; stays in place. I also like that you can adjust the mirror back &amp; forth. Doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
    <li> I bolted this to the wall in a bathroom that 3 teen boys share.  So far, 6 mos later, it is still intact.  I would recommend this product to anyone interested in a swing arm mirror.</li>
    <li> I can see! Very good quality and nice look too.</li>
    <li> Easy to install.  Good magnification.  Attractive.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!! I looked at mirrors like this at Bed,Bath&amp;BEyond and they were like $40 or more. Now I can actually see to pluck my eyebrows..LOL. Great mirror for putting on eye makeup too. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Our medicine cabinet is installed too far back to really use the mirror and moving it forward is not an option so I promised my wife I&#x27;d install one of these mirrors, but we couldn&#x27;t find anything locally that looked and felt like quality while still matching our decor.  So I took a risk on this one and was completely satisfied.  The mirror, arm, and mount all have weight and feel like they&#x27;re well made.  Plus, the design is very nice and matches our decor very well.    Install is pretty easy, but I&#x27;d plan on buying additional screws, or like me, running out to the garage for an extra screw or two until I found the right ones.  It comes with short screws and wall anchors, but I&#x27;ve never been one to totally trust wall anchors, so I located the best stud to use and pre-drilled my holes and mounted it.  I would make sure you estimate where the mirror will be and how tall the person is that will use it the most.  The install went very quickly and I was very pleased with the secure mount once everything was tightened down.    My wife, who said she really didn&#x27;t need it, now uses this at least once a day to apply makeup or tweeze whatever.  Plus, I use it.  A lot more than I thought I would.  Get a good look at the eyebrows I don&#x27;t trim or clean up enough and to get a better view of a nose hair that I haven&#x27;t been able to quite trim.  It&#x27;s a dirty job, but someone has to do it and this really helps.</li>
    <li> Great all around experience and the wife loves it.  Used my own screws and drove them into the wall studs to be secure with no worries.</li>
    <li> Ordered the Jerdon mirror after having used one at the bed &amp; breakfast we were staying in.  It arrived within a few days after I placed the order, was exactly as pictured, easily installed my husband and looks great on my wall. I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> 7x is better than 5x,  i really need it when i start to use it. and it is really easy to install, very steady.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have purchased the&lt;br /&gt;Mirror sooner.  Makes putting on make-up so much easier. Tucks against the wall out of the way. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Installs easily.  Retracts nicely.  Would recommend it to a friend.  It was a little larger than I thought it was going to be but I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
    <li> The extension is a very good length that stays where you want it.  The mounting is easy, but I suggest using sturdier wall anchors if going into sheetrock.  The magnification is just enough since too much magnification mirrors can cause an eye strain if you wear tri-focal lenses.  The side screws that hold the frame to the mirror is a must as some mirrors use a rivet that can break off.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror to be installed in our guest bathroom.  It is a very pretty mirror and extremely functional.  All of my guests have enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> The product is nice overall but the mirror is thin as well as the casing. This product can easily break. Be careful.</li>
    <li> This product is very poorly designed. When I tried to pivot the mirror at the center hinge, it snapped and a metal piece flew into the air nearly breaking my toilet.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like adjustment bolt at the center hinge was &amp;#34;frozen&amp;#34; and simply get broke when I pivoted mirror around it. The spring inside of hinge &amp;#34;catapulted&amp;#34; it with significant energy. This is very dangerous design.&lt;br /&gt;Considering overall good reviews, I decided to give product the second chance, but be careful this time and make sure that all adjustment bolt are &amp;#34;movable&amp;#34; before trying to pivot mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement worked fine, but had missing screws. Ok. I took them from the first mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The last problem I experienced is vertical adjustment during installation. The base has both, round and oval holes for screws, but both oval holes are vertical, so you have very limited ability to adjust base to make it vertical.</li>
    <li> This swivel mirror is a handsome chrome, sturdy, and swivels with ease.  For stability, we secured the screws in the inner plate to a stud in the wall. We positioned the height to 1) cast window light on my face  and 2) provide the most comfortable close up of my face.  After each use, I push the mirror toward the wall, to prevent its catching any direct sun rays.  For 20 years, I had happily used a Big Eyes 8x small mirror on a gooseneck  stand.  However, its jiggling when bumped--all too often--wasted a lot of my time.  My Jerdon 7x has a bigger view, plenty of magnification, and thank goodness, no handholding needed.  Making up my face now is a pleasure.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror.  It&#x27;s been sturdy and maintained its good looks.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of the beaded edge but does its job and easy to install.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror for the price. Wife is happy there is no more pedestal on her counter top</li>
    <li> I wanted a mirror like this after staying in a hotel that had one.  I went on-line and they all seemed too expensive.  Then I saw this more in my price range and I was afraid that it would be cheaply made but am very satisfied with it.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever trying to put on make-up in the mirror over my vanity anymore!</li>
    <li> A hotel I was staying at recently had one of these mirror&#x27;s in their bathroom, it had 5x magnification.  I liked using the mirror so much that I ordered one (a 7X magnification)when I returned home. I use it ever morning and I would recommend it to any one who really wants to see what they look like up close</li>
    <li> This mirror is excellent. I wanted one after seeing these in hotels. The wall mount saves valuable counter space. Wish I had thought of it earlier.</li>
    <li> Like most things made in CHINA it half way works, the mounting screws are too long to seat the base so you must modify.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Look like real thing boss&amp;#34; overall it will work.</li>
    <li> Works great! and a great price!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these..they are great and easy to install..no more hand held mirror for putting on makeup..love it</li>
    <li> Got this mirror because it&#x27;s been getting harder and harder for me to see when applying my makeup!  This mirror is great!  Worried at first that it was not strong enough magnification, but it does the trick and would purchase again.  It came in a timely manner, easy to install and looks good on the wall!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this highly.  Very easy to install and looks fantastic in my bathroom!!!  The quality is A plus.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product.  As with all wall-mounted products, secure it with good quality, after-market anchors.  The base hinge is already squeeking--maybe all it needs is some lubricant.  I&#x27;m think of buying another one for the other bathroom.  One more thing, it has a great finish, very shiny.</li>
    <li> These mirrors ( I&#x27;ve had one for years)  are used every day and we really miss them when we are away from home.</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;Great&amp;#34; mirror. Hung it by the master bathroom sink. Works great. Very clean cut looking and professional appeal.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Like closeup image.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it &amp; uses it daily.</li>
    <li> It only took me a few minutes to install this, and I love having it in my bathroom for makeup and what have you. It folds away nicely so it&#x27;s not in-your-face. Really enjoy having it!</li>
    <li> The item was good, but the magnifying side was not as expected. I thought I would see everything clearly. Overall, I am satisfied with the product. It is nice and flexible.</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror. 8 only wish it was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> I have wanted a mirror like this for a long time but was wary of buying one which would be poor quality or of spending too much money.  I feel that this product is a great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;1. It is a great quality.  Both the magnifier mirror and the regular mirror are top of the line, crystal clear.&lt;br /&gt;2. I installed it myself while my husband sat on the bed playing words with friends.  I do not remember it coming with wall anchors so I provided those, but I had a box in the garage. (Be aware that you may need to provide your own - they are cheap at the hardware store.  The mirror is heavy so if you are not installing in a stud drywall anchors are required.)  A drill is important for this project - or a Phillips head screw driver if you are ambitious.&lt;br /&gt;3. This mirror has a nice range.  It saves my back from leaning over the counter to get close to the mirror on the wall behind the sink.  For reference, when fully extended straight the distance from the mirror to the wall mount is 12 inches.  The small segment is 4 inches and the larger segment is 8 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!  I wish I had purchased one years ago!</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the money and comes with the hardware to make for an easy instillation.  It does not have a light but seems to work well in a well lit bathroom</li>
    <li> I like being able to see the out of place eyebrows.  Also other facial hair that seem to appear as you get older!</li>
    <li> This is our second purchase of this item.  Purchased the first over a year ago, which prompted to purchase the same again.  Have not been disappointed. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This was a second purchase of this item.  I bought one for myself and liked it so much I bought another for a birthday gift.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased, and installed just this morning, this wall mount mirror. I didn&#x27;t have unrealistic expectations about the product itself. The mirrors on both sides seem fine - no anufacturing or quality control issues. There are two areas, though, that do have problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The holes in the escutcheon where the mirror connects to the mounting plate are not level or even. This was not noticed, of course, until I had actually put the mounting plate up on the wall. My attempts at making it level were for naught. One hole is about an 1/8 lower than the other putting the thing slightly off kilter. It mounts fine and is stable, but for those of you who are perfectionists, you should check the actual alignment before installing the mounting plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The hinge where the lower arm connects to the escutcheon squeaks like crazy whenever the lower arm is manipulated. I will try some silicone lube on it, but it&#x27;s a bit disconcerting. Again - this is something that seems like a manufacturing quality control issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that it&#x27;s a wall mount mirror that has a decent amount of magnification on one side. The chrome finish is fine and while the entire item has some heft to it, the escutcheon feels too thin.  Not much more to say about it than that.</li>
    <li> I Love it! I wear readers, so you can imagine how difficult  it is to apply my eye make-up without my glasses. This Jerdon mirror with 7x magnification is the answer to my problem. I can see clearly now! Thanks Jerdon....</li>
    <li> The quality of this mirror is so great!  The price is right as well!  Most quality wall mounted mirrors are 5 times the cost!  Will be buying more of these for gifts!  Fast delievery also.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife, she loves it but as a man and the one who had to mount it, I appreciate the heavy duty dry wall anchors it came with and the mounting plate that has 2 vertical holes. Hang the top at the height you need and the bottom one will fall perfectly level, gravity for the win.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this mirror and would recommend it to anyone. I saw a mirror like this in our room when traveling, got home and ordered this one, hoping it would be as good as the one in the room - I have been very pleased with it. It has excellent magnification, easy to install and easy to keep clean. I have no dislikes concerning this mirror. Would buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> Nice quality.  Have a few others I purchased a couple years ago and they are holding up great at a beach location</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for to hung by the bathroom sink. Easy to install and just the right size.</li>
    <li> Mirror came without screws for mounting in the wall. Those are easy to find in a hardware store, but being missing is representative of the lack of attention to basic quality. Other reviews noted that screws are often missing and that it&#x27;s tough to get the thing mounted and level, so I was prepared. Well, I used a level and the screws and plate were horizontally and vertically level - but the mirror is not! The vertical hinge joint piece of the mirror is leaning noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition as others noted, the hinge arm is shortish and stiff. I think the stamped &#x27;beads&#x27; are rather gaudy looking as well. If you&#x27;re going to be cheap and poorly constructed, make it simple, it&#x27;s less noticeable. This is getting returned.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and great for putting in my contacts.</li>
    <li> Good, steady mount for a mirror with good resolution.  No distortion.</li>
    <li> Good mirror for the money .</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000G686MM Jerdon JP7507CB 8-InchWall Mount Mirror, 7X Magnification, Chrome Finish]]&lt;br /&gt;After staying in a nice hotel with one of these and finally being able to see my eyebrows closely, I couldn&#x27;t wait to order one for my home.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 65 years old and I wear trifocals which makes it difficult to do anything closeup without lots of light and magnification.  I was able to hang this myself but not with the the hangers provided.  I didn&#x27;t know how to use them - my fault, not theirs.  One thing to note: don&#x27;t assume that if you line up the mounting holes level that it will hang level.  The holes punched in the mirror mount are NOT punched horizontal so it takes a little messing around with a manual level to get this right.  I would recommend it to a friend - with someone competent to hang it for her.</li>
