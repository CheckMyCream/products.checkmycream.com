      <li>This product is very oily but as one user wrote it dries quickly.</li>

      <li>I tried it as a sample and really noticed a difference...</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like how it turns out.</li>

      <li>It did absolutely nothing for me</li>
      <li>Thanks, Rita M. Parker</li>
      <li>then my makeup goes on so much easier and there isn&#x27;t any greasy look.  </li>

      <li>Squalane, the main ingredient is made from shark livers.</li>
      <li>Love this product Have received it twice as a gift and this last time purchased it myself I see an instant difference in my parentheses around my mouth when I apply it before my makeup-great results!!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and I have found it is beneficial on other areas besides the face.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes my dry 60 year old skin and minimizes the fine lines as well.  </li>
      <li>However, I am 76 and liver in the High Desert of New Mexico and I use about 1 1/2 drops every morning and every night  </li>
      <li>5 years and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really give it an accurate rating, but when I use it at night my skin is really very, very soft in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to a ton of things and have older (73yr old) skin.</li>
      <li>If your face gets chapped from winter cold, dry wind, this is an excellent product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a greasy, oil based, clear liquid that leaves an oily film on your face.  </li>

      <li>My wrinkles seem to be smoother, but I think it is too early to tell yet.  </li>

      <li>I was complimented by an old pal on how much younger I looked!!!</li>
      <li>Apparently it takes 3000 sharks to make 1 ton.</li>
      <li>We live in a dry climate, and this product helps keep my face hydrated.  </li>

<li> I have had problems for years with dry skin around my nose.  </li>
<li> Not sure if I got an old product?</li>
<li> However, I have very dry skin because I am a gastric bypass patient, and I struggle with water intake, but anyways I need to apply it twice a day.</li>
<li> Helps heal chapped lips, rough cuticles, etc.  </li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>

<li> After applying it, it seems to take away the dark circles an wrinkles</li>
<li> I squirt a little in the palm of my hand and put it on face and neck.  </li>
<li> In her late 90&#x27;s, she looks at least 15 years younger than her age.  </li>
<li> so use it year round.  </li>
<li> It feels heavy for a few minutes then miraculously disappears.  </li>
<li> NO more of Dr. Larks products for me.</li>
<li> Very few things give immediate results...</li>
<li> Now they&#x27;ve changed the formula and it&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb.</li>
<li> Not good for day use.</li>
<li> I combine it with a toner or moisture spray to thin it out.  </li>
<li> It is an oil and difficult to apply, but it&#x27;s manageable.  </li>
<li> any makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very nice moisturizer for use in the winter.  If your face gets chapped from winter cold, dry wind, this is an excellent product.  It never burns chapped skin.  I believe I like the lavender scented better but that is just a personal preference.</li>
    <li> Only moisturizer I&#x27;ve used that consistently leaves skin smooth without a greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Love this product Have received it twice as a gift and this last time purchased it myself I see an instant difference in my parentheses around my mouth when I apply it before my makeup-great results!!</li>
    <li> I would have given five starts if I no longer had wrinkles.  However, I am 76 and liver in the High Desert of New Mexico and I use about 1 1/2 drops every morning and every night  My skin feels softer and better than before i started using it a year ago.</li>
    <li> So glad for a natural skin care product!  It is wonderful for smoothing and moisturizing skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not work well around eyes an area that always needs extra care.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for quite awhile and my skin has never looked better, especially around my eyes</li>
    <li> I use this product for several years but only because my skin is dry. It&#x27;s not a MOISTURIZER. If i have to use it for the night I have to protect pillowcases  because it leaves oily spots. To put back oil into your skin this works.</li>
    <li> The product goes on great and absorbs well, but the smell is a bit off.  Not sure if I got an old product?</li>
    <li> After applying it, it seems to take away the dark circles an wrinkles but then it leaves a light flaky film on my skin which really shows when I put foundation on. I really don&#x27;t like how it turns out. Looks as if my skin is peeling</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference.  For all the hype I expected more.  I&#x27;ll use it anyway.  Don&#x27;t feel like the hustle sending it back.</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful.  You can see the difference the first time you use it. Completely moisturizes and also has anti - aging properties.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizing oil for your face.  It is no longer available to purchase from the manufacturer and I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Did not like how it felt on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It&#x27;s the only product that really does reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is so wonderful . I use it every day morning and night and my skin feels so soft and looks good</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It moisturizes my dry 60 year old skin and minimizes the fine lines as well.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I use it on my face, eyes, neck, feet,--- everywhere.  I also mix a drop with my liquid makeup which makes it go on smooth and even and covers my pores.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years now and I notice a difference in my skin.  I keep ordering so I have plenty of bottles in reserve!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  The best.</li>
    <li> Very good....I use it at night for moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Trilane for about 2 weeks now.  At first it goes on greasy, but it absorbs after about 15 minutes.  It does not clog pores or cause irritation.  In the morning my skin is soft and smooth.  My wrinkles seem to be smoother, but I think it is too early to tell yet.  Overall, I like the way it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
    <li> Best skin product I have ever used. A must for daily skin care. I have used this product for over two years.</li>
    <li> I have had problems for years with dry skin around my nose.  This product has really helped, and seems to reduce the fine lines.  It is kind of greasy for day time use, so allow time for it to absorb if you are putting on make up...</li>
    <li> I first used this as a sample, liked it and thought I&#x27;d give a full size a try.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really give it an accurate rating, but when I use it at night my skin is really very, very soft in the morning.  It is an oil and difficult to apply, but it&#x27;s manageable.  Time will tell!</li>
    <li> I combine it with a toner or moisture spray to thin it out.  It feels heavy for a few minutes then miraculously disappears.  Helps heal chapped lips, rough cuticles, etc.  My skin loves it. Great as a make-up primer.</li>
    <li> I was complimented by an old pal on how much younger I looked!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product several years ago and loved it. Now they&#x27;ve changed the formula and it&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb. I have to leave it on my face for like an hour before I can apply any makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad. I really like to support cosmetics and products that are not toxic for me or the environment.</li>
    <li> This has soften my lines and has given my skin a glow. However, I feel like I may need to add something else with Coenzyme Q10. However,for the short period of time that I have used this product I think their significant benefits with moisture. However, I have very dry skin because I am a gastric bypass patient, and I struggle with water intake, but anyways I need to apply it twice a day. It feels really nice on my face very smooth, a little oily, but absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> I use this product because it adds moisture to a face that had to much sun as a child. I use another drug at night for the pre- cancer cells because I know I can rinse my face in the morning and then re apply Trilane (unscented) to my face and it won&#x27;t sting like other moisture do. Thanks, Rita M. Parker</li>
    <li> I have found this to be very good for my dry (and aged) skin.  It&#x27;s easy to use and I have found it is beneficial on other areas besides the face. I have put it on my hands, neck, heels, knees and elbows.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for approx. 5 years and can&#x27;t live without it.  My daughter can&#x27;t use it in the summer as she still has oil in her skin but at my age there is no oil left so use it year round.  I put it over my regular moisturizer then my makeup goes on so much easier and there isn&#x27;t any greasy look.  A 1 oz. bottle lasts over six months as you do not use much.  A little bit goes a long way.  I squirt a little in the palm of my hand and put it on face and neck.  If any is left it goes on my hands and arms.</li>
    <li> It does not do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Very few things give immediate results...I tried it as a sample and really noticed a difference...it does not come out of the bottle too well but I love it anyway...I use it now and then and am very pleased...</li>
    <li> Squalane, the main ingredient is made from shark livers. Apparently it takes 3000 sharks to make 1 ton. Thanks for killing sharks and putting it on your face.</li>
    <li> This product is very oily but as one user wrote it dries quickly. Not good for day use. I used this at night for 2 months and it did absoutely nothing. It did not stop the winter weather from drying out my face even if I used it during the day. Please remember, if it seems too good to be true, it probably isn&#x27;t. I won&#x27;t purchase this product again nor will I buy Squalane either.  I tried that product and it didn&#x27;t work either.  NO more of Dr. Larks products for me. i wonder if she is really a medical doctor? You would think that she would put ingredients that work into her products.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Mamma has been using this for years.  In her late 90&#x27;s, she looks at least 15 years younger than her age.  Of course, she&#x27;s beautiful to begin with!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product a week ago, direct from the seller&#x27;s website.  On the 1st day, I felt a definite change in the softness of my skin.  It&#x27;s working well on my face, neck, decolletage, hands, cuticles, etc..  BUT, it isn&#x27;t absorbing into the skin.  I can feel an oily residue throughout the day.  Currently, I am not using and makeup to test this product out.  What are your suggestions?</li>
    <li> I am allergic to a ton of things and have older (73yr old) skin. This product is the best I&#x27;ve found in a long time! Love the fact that it is unscented.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Larks Trilane Anti-Aging Moisturizer for years.  We live in a dry climate, and this product helps keep my face hydrated.  I use it at night after washing, and applying a natural rose toner.  It&#x27;s nice when people think I look 10-15 yrs younger when I am in my early 60s.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product at this point. I have just begun using  .</li>
    <li> This should not be listed as a moisturizer.  It&#x27;s a greasy, oil based, clear liquid that leaves an oily film on your face.  If you wear make-up, forget it.  It may work as a night-time product, but it should not be considered a moisturizer.  It did absolutely nothing for me and I would not recommend this product.  It received one star because I can&#x27;t give it a \\&quot;zero\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several year as it works great for my skin.  I&#x27;m now in my 70&#x27;s and find that this product is the&lt;br /&gt;only thing I need to keep my skin soft.</li>
