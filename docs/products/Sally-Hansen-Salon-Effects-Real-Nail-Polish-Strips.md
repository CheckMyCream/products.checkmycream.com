### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Its works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Great idea.</li>
      <li>the are great.</li>
      <li>I tried the strips and was happy with the look.  </li>
      <li>Well the idea looked great</li>
      <li>liked the color, but they didn&#x27;t stick!</li>
      <li>A lot has to be changed for this product to be successful.</li>
      <li>They look good for a good 10 days.</li>
      <li>I was really pleased with the results as they stayed on my nails well over 2 weeks!</li>
      <li>More import - NOT FOR KIDS!</li>
      <li>They were so cute!</li>
      <li>It helps if you have scissors handy, because then you can cut one strip and use it for your two pinky nails, or what have you.</li>
      <li>They are kind of a pain in the ass.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much, but once I started putting the strips on I was impressed by how easy they were to apply and how good they looked.</li>
      <li>They apply easily and they look great for many days, but when it&#x27;s time to remove it</li>
      <li>Once u get the hang of it very easy to do and no smudges.</li>
      <li>These are by far the best product I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>They were great at first</li>
      <li>I hope Sally Hansen notices that they need more variety in sizes and incorporates</li>
      <li>I was in love with these.  </li>
      <li>You can get more time than they say even.</li>
      <li>Mostly because I wanted to have nail strengthener on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing them for 2 weeks now</li>
      <li>I love the Incoco strips.  </li>
      <li>After trying the Incoco strips, I feel like these Sally Henson ones are more suited for twelve year olds.</li>
      <li>I got the houndstooth ones cause i love that print.  </li>
      <li>ok..</li>
      <li>/&gt;Applying a top coat//base coat would help as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They were on tv &amp; I believe in the latest Cosmo Magazine.</li>
      <li>I did have doubts but boy am I glad I went ahead and purchase this product.</li>
      <li>Cute design</li>
      <li>I would not suggest using this product until they find a better solution for removing them.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>the colors are much more sophisticated.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I was set on getting 410 Love letter for Valentines.</li>
      <li>the process of trimming the top.</li>
      <li>This baffles me the most.</li>
      <li>They started to crack and chip off at the top of the nail.  </li>
      <li>They are cute, but I don&#x27;t think theyre as easy and no fuss as SH makes them out to be.</li>
      <li>I loved them because they lasted over a week and were so cute but not so much now.</li>
      <li>They do also seem to chip easily as well</li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone because they are easy to apply.</li>
      <li>but fortunately the lace pattern covers those flaws.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Apart from the thumb one none fit my fingers, all overlaped on the sides,</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t find a good one near my hotel</li>
      <li>/&gt;Application of these were significantly longer than getting my nails done, took well over an hour.</li>
      <li>these just will never be worth it to me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll put a coat of clear nail polish on top just for added protection.  </li>
      <li>I use a good base and then cover it with a nice top coat to get more out of the look.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t see these worth it.</li>
      <li>I was able to get creative and make it work with other nail polish, but would have preferred them all to work.</li>
      <li>They work well, are easy to apply, and still look good several days later.</li>
      <li>I am by no means nail illiterate; I know how to do nails professionally and very well and love doing it.</li>
      <li>After following the directions (which I believe lead to my success) they went on perfectly and have lasted 11 days so far without a single chip.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know if this made a difference but just about every single one of them didn&#x27;t just split off nicely like the video shows, they chipped</li>
      <li>Previously I had really strong, healthy nails.</li>
      <li>They are tricky to put on at first, but you get the hang of it after a while.</li>
      <li>First - I used them on my toes - not my nails.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m definitely willing to take a shot at it again.</li>
      <li>second time I tried the \\&quot;love letter\\&quot; ones.</li>
      <li>You can do a much better and easier job using regular nail polish.</li>
      <li>They even have a \\&quot;french tip\\&quot; that I&#x27;m in love with ([[ASIN:</li>
      <li>only kept them on for 5 days, they did not seem to chip or peal much more than they already had just during the application during the wear</li>
      <li>This was one of the first of these products I ever used</li>
      <li>I had to soak my nails in the remover, scrub, scream (the polish looked no different), and scrub some more.  </li>
      <li>forward to getting some more standard nail polish colors of these.  </li>
      <li>I have a real weakness for anything leopard print, so I fancied a fun animal print manicure for my holiday.</li>
      <li>Typically I alternate between the nail strips and my own nails painted clear.</li>
      <li>First Love (Classic French Manicure)]]).</li>
      <li>The range of sizes is suitable for an adult hand (16 strips total in varying widths).  </li>
      <li>My nails are hard, strong and healthy.</li>
      <li>it seems that only one side of a strip will fit on a certain nail, so its not like you can reuse them.</li>
      <li>They do look pretty good considering how much trouble they are but are over priced for how easy it is to mess up.</li>
      <li>they weren&#x27;t very flexible - the directions say to stretch it over your nail</li>
      <li>I had to scrub my nail really</li>
      <li>Chip free for ten days, Yay!!  </li>
      <li>It just depends on how fast your nails grow.</li>
      <li>I put clear polish on top for extra hold .</li>
      <li>but they are enough fun that it seems like it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>If you want to try this product I would recommend taking them off after a couple days to let your nails breath and return to normal.</li>
      <li>I am not sure if a set of scissors and a lot of patience are going to keep this a good activity for a younger girl</li>
      <li>In my opinion they are a better quality, long lasting,  and</li>
      <li>What normally takes me 2 to 4 cotton balls to remove nail polish took me about 15 just to get it all off.  </li>
      <li>Everyone that decides to buy this, will not regret it because it looks great in a casual outfit, or going out.</li>
      <li>They were so easy to apply I could have done it in the dark.  </li>
      <li>They are super thick and strong - and also provide complete coverage if you have any nail imperfections you need to cover</li>
      <li>If you get lucky and get a package that is brand new right from the manufacturer then this may work, but if not then you will have just wasted your money.</li>
      <li>They looks shiny and new.</li>
      <li>You need to exercise some care when putting the strips on, but they&#x27;re pretty forgiving as long as you&#x27;re gentle with them.    </li>
      <li>I usually have long, quick growing, healthy nails</li>
      <li>If you take the time to apply it right by using the given file to buff the nails and then use nail polish to get excess oils off the nail it stays for a long time.  </li>
      <li>top of that the strips are rather thin and see through, I used black as that is my favorite color of my nails however due to the fact I have rather long nails you could see through them in the light, not like nail polish which actually blocks the light</li>
      <li>and I just can&#x27;t understand how these have such positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Use nail clippers, put on a clear coat or two..</li>
      <li>When I tried to take a smaller one and gently stretch it like the directions suggest it ripped at what seemed like the slightest of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no trouble getting them to stick.  </li>
      <li>Should be much easier next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
      <li>I am surprised how well these worked.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I messed up somewhere because I skipped the instructions, vaguely remembered them</li>
      <li>I think they could go even long however my nails grow fast</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great idea. They look good for a good 10 days. Once u get the hang of it very easy to do and no smudges.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews prior to spending my $9 to purchase these. I was set on getting 410 Love letter for Valentines. I followed all of the directions. However, I found they were a little difficult to put on at first. Once I got the hang of it, not so bad except I had a few dry out prior to getting them positioned on my nails. They were so cute! After about an hour, they began to peel on the edges. If I have to put on a base coat and top coat in order to get them to work, I could just paint my nails. I can&#x27;t imagine them lasting 10 days like they advertise...I didn&#x27;t even take a shower or wash dishes in them and they peeled off;(</li>
    <li> I was in love with these.  They were so easy to apply I could have done it in the dark.  I told all my friends about them.  Even strangers!  They lasted forever and didn&#x27;t chip or tear.  Then, the big disappointment.  I had to use half a bottle of nail polish remover and it took me an hour.  I had to soak my nails in the remover, scrub, scream (the polish looked no different), and scrub some more.  Now, the skin on my finger tips is all dry and cracked becuase of all the remover I had to use.  I would not suggest using this product until they find a better solution for removing them.  More import - NOT FOR KIDS!</li>
    <li> I have a real weakness for anything leopard print, so I fancied a fun animal print manicure for my holiday. I was going to go to a nail salon but I couldn&#x27;t find a good one near my hotel so I picked up a box of Sally Hansen Salon Effects nail polish strips in Kitty, Kitty.    I didn&#x27;t expect much, but once I started putting the strips on I was impressed by how easy they were to apply and how good they looked. You need to exercise some care when putting the strips on, but they&#x27;re pretty forgiving as long as you&#x27;re gentle with them.    My only complaint about the strips is that you get 16 in a pack (eight nail size choices per hand) and you&#x27;re advised to discard the ones you don&#x27;t use, which seems like a waste. Now I have experience putting them on, next time I&#x27;ll try making the remaining strips work for my toes.     If you&#x27;d like to see the end results of my home manicure, visit Twitpic using the following link - [...]</li>
    <li> Well the idea looked great so I bought this. BUT of course the glue was dried up on the backing so it was not able to stick onto my nail. This will be a continous problem because it has a very, very short shelf life and its not returnable. A lot has to be changed for this product to be successful. If you get lucky and get a package that is brand new right from the manufacturer then this may work, but if not then you will have just wasted your money.</li>
    <li> I got the houndstooth ones cause i love that print.  They were great at first but after I tried taking off the nail polish it took forever and they turned my nails yellow.  What normally takes me 2 to 4 cotton balls to remove nail polish took me about 15 just to get it all off.  My nails were yellow afterwards.  This is definatly not something that i would get again.</li>
    <li> I was let down after all the hype. They were on tv &amp; I believe in the latest Cosmo Magazine. I found them hard to apply. Then when I FINALLY got them on they looked like I&#x27;d put a bandaid on my fingernails. Cute design but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;d REALLY only recommend these to someone who had longer nails. If you bite yours or have short nails, forget about it! I&#x27;ll just continue to paint my nails or leave them alone.</li>
    <li> I have been using various styles of these for 3 months on and off. Typically I alternate between the nail strips and my own nails painted clear. I have ALWAYS had fragile nails with lots of breakage. Since using these, I have had 1 slightly chipped nail and ZERO BREAKAGE. I had one nail slightly chip. IN 3 months. My nails are hard, strong and healthy. I get compliments every time I use the nail strips. the are great.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m not very impressed. I bought laced up and used on a shorter squared fake nail. I am by no means nail illiterate; I know how to do nails professionally and very well and love doing it. I would never use any of these that don&#x27;t have a design or pattern. They are kind of a pain in the ass. They do wrinkle.. but fortunately the lace pattern covers those flaws. There is no reason why you would need the plain colors. You can do a much better and easier job using regular nail polish. I also don&#x27;t recommend filing off the excess. Use nail clippers, put on a clear coat or two.. let dry and then file. They do look pretty good considering how much trouble they are but are over priced for how easy it is to mess up.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;m very hard on nail polish and this stuff is pretty tough.  If you take the time to apply it right by using the given file to buff the nails and then use nail polish to get excess oils off the nail it stays for a long time.  I&#x27;ll put a coat of clear nail polish on top just for added protection.  It starts to chip off after a week though.  My only complaint is how expensive this is on Amazon.  $15, seriously?  It&#x27;s $8 at Walmart.  Don&#x27;t waste your money here, just go to Walmart, Walgreens, or CVS.</li>
    <li> I got the nail polish strips on a whim. I thought it would make a nice christmas stocking gift for a tween in my life and thought I should try them out before to prevent disappointment on christmas morning.  They work well, are easy to apply, and still look good several days later. I have gardened, washed dishes, and I can still wear them to work tomorrow.  The range of sizes is suitable for an adult hand (16 strips total in varying widths).  I am not sure if a set of scissors and a lot of patience are going to keep this a good activity for a younger girl but they are enough fun that it seems like it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Its works wonderfully. Just take your time. I put clear polish on top for extra hold . I did have doubts but boy am I glad I went ahead and purchase this product. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I am surprised how well these worked.  First - I used them on my toes - not my nails.  And I did use a clear base coat and top coat.  Mostly because I wanted to have nail strengthener on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing them for 2 weeks now and there is not a single chip!  They looks shiny and new. They are super thick and strong - and also provide complete coverage if you have any nail imperfections you need to cover up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no trouble getting them to stick.  The strips I used I&#x27;d had for about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did take awhile to put on.  Should be much easier next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to getting some more standard nail polish colors of these.  I may give up pedicures!</li>
    <li> liked the color, but they didn&#x27;t stick! I have used these products before, but for some reason this batch didn&#x27;t work. I will still use these, but maybe not from this seller.</li>
    <li> These smell so bad, and the ingredients list pthalates. I wish I had known that prior to buying. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these several times on my toes and it lasts for weeks at a time.  Took a shot and tried to use it on my fingernails and was very disappointed.  After washing dishes, bathing, doing my hair, and a few other daily tasks, the strips were cracking by the next day.  They started to crack and chip off at the top of the nail.  Needless to say by the end of the week I was removing what was left of the strips off my nails.  After reading some of the other reviews, I&#x27;ve come to the conlusion that I could have had a bad box so I&#x27;m definitely willing to take a shot at it again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make it 12 hours before they chipped and not 24 hours before I could peal the entire thing off!  I&#x27;ve used them before for the quick and \\&quot;convenient\\&quot; manicure on the run but considering how expensive they are (I mean for what they are) these really suck.  I love the Incoco strips.  In my opinion they are a better quality, long lasting,  and the colors are much more sophisticated.  They even have a \\&quot;french tip\\&quot; that I&#x27;m in love with ([[ASIN:B005XBG2J4 Incoco French Manicure: First Love (Classic French Manicure)]]). After trying the Incoco strips, I feel like these Sally Henson ones are more suited for twelve year olds.</li>
    <li> ok.. I just put these on tonight so I can&#x27;t comment about their staying power.I will say this, they were a bit of a pain to put on. they weren&#x27;t very flexible - the directions say to stretch it over your nail but when I ( gently) tried on a few strips they ripped. Which brings me to another point.. there are only 16 strips in the box! You have 10 fingers.. why not put the extra 4 in the box? it seems that only one side of a strip will fit on a certain nail, so its not like you can reuse them. This baffles me the most. They do also seem to chip easily as well which is annoying because of the issue with the count in the box. They are cute, but I don&#x27;t think theyre as easy and no fuss as SH makes them out to be.</li>
    <li> Previously I had really strong, healthy nails. I used these for about a month continuously and my nails are now peeling. Its really strange my nails have never peeled off in strips before. I&#x27;ve had to cut them really short too because the tips of my natural nail are such a mess. I loved them because they lasted over a week and were so cute but not so much now. Too bad - hope they come up with a solution.</li>
    <li> I tried the strips and was happy with the look.  Chip free for ten days, Yay!!  But since I removed them my nails have been dry and brittle.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem like this before.  I usually have long, quick growing, healthy nails but now they are thin, flaky and broken down to the tip of my fingers. If you want to try this product I would recommend taking them off after a couple days to let your nails breath and return to normal.</li>
    <li> Reason for 3 stars was because expired. Typically i like these nail stickers, but not this time. Three stips of 4 nails come in the box. One of them was expired and dried. So i was left with 8 stickers. I was able to get creative and make it work with other nail polish, but would have preferred them all to work. I would recommend to anyone because they are easy to apply. The only downfall is since there is no expiration date on them you dont know if they&#x27;re dried until actually using them.</li>
    <li> They apply easily and they look great for many days, but when it&#x27;s time to remove it it&#x27;s a nightmare. Regular nail polish remover has not really work well to remove the remaining polish.</li>
    <li> Everyone that decides to buy this, will not regret it because it looks great in a casual outfit, or going out.</li>
    <li> I had gotten something similar from avon several years ago I thought I&#x27;d give these a try. For starters I have never seen such a limited sizing option as far as the strips go, I&#x27;ve used fake nails for years and never had a problem finding ones to fit but it seemed this only had three sizes, one for my thumb one slightly smaller for my other fingers and one too small for my pinkie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the thumb one none fit my fingers, all overlaped on the sides, when I tried to trim them it just looked jagged and bad. When I tried to take a smaller one and gently stretch it like the directions suggest it ripped at what seemed like the slightest of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the process of trimming the top. I have squared nails so I don&#x27;t know if this made a difference but just about every single one of them didn&#x27;t just split off nicely like the video shows, they chipped the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application of these were significantly longer than getting my nails done, took well over an hour. Applying them without creating a bump or fold, even using the tool is almost impossible. By the time I was done I had what looked like a 3 day old chipped and broken manicure on my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that the strips are rather thin and see through, I used black as that is my favorite color of my nails however due to the fact I have rather long nails you could see through them in the light, not like nail polish which actually blocks the light so the color stays consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only kept them on for 5 days, they did not seem to chip or peal much more than they already had just during the application during the wear time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the worst part is removal. After an hour and a half, 20 or so Q-tips &lt;you cannot use paper towel or tissue like with nail polish because it just sticks to the nail&gt; almost half a bottle of nail polish remover I still have a sticky tarry substance all over my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came here and I just can&#x27;t understand how these have such positive reviews. I followed the directions to a T and even if maybe I just got a bad package with really odd sized nails that didn&#x27;t fit the removal is such a hassle I couldn&#x27;t see these worth it. That combined with how I spent 10 dollars on one package which is the same minus for tip of getting them actually done at my salon these just will never be worth it to me.</li>
    <li> The very first time I got these strips was quite a few months ago. I got the red and black stripped ones- don&#x27;t remember the name of those. They are tricky to put on at first, but you get the hang of it after a while. I was really pleased with the results as they stayed on my nails well over 2 weeks! Had a few chips here and there but wasn&#x27;t noticeable. But man oh man, were they difficult to get off! I had to scrub my nail really hard.&lt;br /&gt;The second time I tried the \\&quot;love letter\\&quot; ones. I&#x27;m pretty sure I messed up somewhere because I skipped the instructions, vaguely remembered them and they barely stuck to my nail. Those failed.&lt;br /&gt;I got the red and black ones again, confiding in those. They stayed on well. Now I got \\&quot;You&#x27;re a Star\\&quot; ones and they are beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know nail sizes are a big issue with a lot of people, and a big issue with me being petite and having small fingers. It helps if you have scissors handy, because then you can cut one strip and use it for your two pinky nails, or what have you. You could try cutting one smaller, but be careful. I hope Sally Hansen notices that they need more variety in sizes and incorporates changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying a top coat//base coat would help as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to wipe any oil//dirt of your nails BEFORE applying these. That&#x27;s where a lot of people are having issues from what I&#x27;ve read in the \\&quot;They don&#x27;t stick at all!!\\&quot; reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these as they provide a change up from me having to fuss with chipping nail polish all the time. I hope that this product will improve in the future.</li>
    <li> These blew my mind. I am now a believer. Having not known anyone who had tired them I picked them up one day onsale. After following the directions (which I believe lead to my success) they went on perfectly and have lasted 11 days so far without a single chip. I think they could go even long however my nails grow fast so I am in need of a \\&quot;fill.\\&quot; I dont remember a day in the past 10 plus years of my life where my nails weren&#x27;t painted. I have tried every brand of polish and everything to come on the market. These are by far the best product I have ever tried. No dry time, lasting so long and under $10 dollars. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I put these on at 8am and before 9:30am they were falling off.  I washed dishes and they just started falling off.  The first one fell off within 10 min before doing anything but sitting down.  They say nowhere on them not to get them wet.  They say they should stick for days and that to me meant they could get wet.  I mean just basic things like washing hands, showering, doing dishes, etc all use water.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay 10 cents for these much less the $5 I spent.  I won&#x27;t waste my money again.  Don&#x27;t waste your money even though they are pretty they don&#x27;t last at all.</li>
    <li> This is 99% the ONLY brand I use for basic nail cover. You can get more time than they say even. It just depends on how fast your nails grow. I use a good base and then cover it with a nice top coat to get more out of the look. This was one of the first of these products I ever used and I like this pattern so much that I went crazy trying to get my hands on as many of them as I could, because unfortunately it was already discontinued.</li>
