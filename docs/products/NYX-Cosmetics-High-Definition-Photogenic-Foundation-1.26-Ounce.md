      <li>I love NYX products and this one is a good one.</li>
      <li>I have tried every kind of foundation out there</li>
      <li>makeup wise, this product was just OK...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a nice foundation.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, I must say that I&#x27;m a gal with a VERY fair complexion.</li>
      <li>this is a great full coverage foundation.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottle has a pump, makes it very easy to dispense&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s light and gives good coverage.</li>
      <li>I was REALLY excited about ordering this because friends had used it and LOVED it.</li>
      <li>The color is very neutral and probably good for most fair tones b/c</li>
      <li>She was not too pleased.  </li>
      <li>it did worked ok for about an hour of wear.</li>
      <li>TRY IT! :))</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure you can build it up.</li>
      <li>I love this foundation.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS JUST OKAY.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>ITS AN OKAY FOUNDATION , I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE BETTER</li>
      <li>I will always love my high end cosmetic lines (WHEN I can treat myself to them), but this is a really great addition to my foundations that I can see myself using a lot.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good foundation.  </li>
      <li>Also, if you want a very even look, get yourself a good foundation brush.</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s perfect!!!</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t notice any strong odor from it</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, blends well, &amp; doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines or pores.  </li>
      <li>great LIGHT cover for daily use love</li>
      <li>It had a very strong chemical smell when I first used it.</li>
      <li>I got Nude and then got Sand Beige because Nude was too light.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m hoping the Nude will not be too light, so I ordered that from here - if it is to light,  I&#x27;ll mix it with the 03 Natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you put it on lightly it doesn&#x27;t cover up anything, you try to build it up</li>
      <li>: It is a light product, so don&#x27;t expect it to cover everything upon applying it to your face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light to medium coverage.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t know if Nude would have too much pink or yellow/orangey hues, but overall I am really impressed with how well it matched up with my fair skin.</li>
      <li>that being said if you don&#x27;t tend to be sensitive then this has good coverage and isn&#x27;t too matte.</li>
      <li>very nice foundation, I am very white skin, and this product is perfect to tone my natural color, I like my natural skin color</li>
      <li>My new favorite make up!</li>
      <li>and this is the only kind that&#x27;s ever given me a rash!</li>
      <li>I was not at all familiar with this brand at all and took a chance and bought it and</li>
      <li>THE COVERGIRL OUTLAST FABULOUS FOUNDATION OR THE LOREAL TRUE MATCH..</li>
      <li>Overall a GREAT foundation, I just didn&#x27;t purchase the right shade.</li>
      <li>Finally, I have quite fair skin with pinkish undertones and have a hard time finding a good match that isn&#x27;t too yellow or too orange and this matches perfectly.  </li>
      <li>My face felt oily and was really shiny even though I use powder over top.</li>
      <li>Not bad,</li>
      <li>The fragrance is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>so i buy this, is perfect to do white make up to for those that had the skin a litlle more dark.</li>
      <li>good product, although i could have used a little more coverage.  </li>
      <li>It is nice to find a foundation that is actually light enough for my skin.</li>
      <li>wish they had a better color range as the darker the shades, the more yellow they get, and I am a neutral beige.</li>
      <li>I had tried many other products of theirs ranging from eye liner to lipstick, but never this kind of stuff.</li>
      <li>This is worth the price for every drop.</li>
      <li>so far it shows the details of my skin even MORE than my drug store foundation.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still trying to find the right moisturizer to combine with this foundation and the NYX primer bc</li>
      <li>how much I like my tried and true revlon colorstay now.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Staying power is good, I just use a matte powder over it and it lasts all day (despite slightly oily skin in my T-zone)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great for very pale people like my daughter who is a ginger.</li>
      <li>Also came with super fast shipping, thanks!</li>
      <li>I need pink undertones but this color (NUDE) is closer to yellow undertones and still works great with my winter complexion (fair skin/dark hair and pink undertones).  </li>
      <li>I really like this foundation!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as heavy as Stay Matte but still provides good coverage without being cakey at all.  </li>
      <li>This foundation is great with one caveat - it has such pink undertones that I cannot find a match for my skin.</li>
      <li>I have used pretty much everything out there</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the foundation and actually prefer it over my Nars sheer glow foundation that I paid over $40 for.</li>
      <li>funny smell but decent foundation</li>
      <li>And the price really seals the deal.</li>
      <li>be built up for medium-full coverage, or put on lightly for sheer coverage&lt;br</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much to cover and can build if needed.  </li>
      <li>Goes on so smoothly and received several compliments on it, try it and you will see for yourself!</li>
      <li>I MUCH PERFER</li>
      <li>it really makes my skin glows with light cover and long last&lt;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great coverage! I&#x27;m usually very happy with NYX and this is no exception! I get very dark red spots on my cheeks and this stuff covers them up without looking fake and caked up.</li>
    <li> very nice foundation, I am very white skin, and this product is perfect to tone my natural color, I like my natural skin color so i buy this, is perfect to do white make up to for those that had the skin a litlle more dark.</li>
    <li> Love these cosmetics and Amazon sells them at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> This product it a little light for me, but it helps with oily skin, I feel I would only use this if I wanted a natural look. If you have dry skin already though I wouldn&#x27;t use this.</li>
    <li> I was REALLY excited about ordering this because friends had used it and LOVED it. But of course I have really pale skin, and ordered the lightest shade offered (Nude) thinking it would be light enought. Nope. I was orange. DRAMATICALLY ORANGE. If they offered it in a lighter shade, I would be a very happy camper. Overall a GREAT foundation, I just didn&#x27;t purchase the right shade.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t quite know what to expect with the color when I bought this based on the swatches but it is super similar to the online swatch and applies crazy smooth.  It is lighter coverage for me compared to Revlon Colorstay liquid that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  So I do have to apply two layers/coats to get the coverage that I need but the application is so great it makes me question how much I like my tried and true revlon colorstay now.  The color is very neutral and probably good for most fair tones b/c I need pink undertones but this color (NUDE) is closer to yellow undertones and still works great with my winter complexion (fair skin/dark hair and pink undertones).  Great product, I&#x27;m a believer.  Also came with super fast shipping, thanks! This may become my new everyday makeup instead of the colorstay liquid.</li>
    <li> I usually use Make Up Forever&#x27;s HD foundation in Marble (and sometimes Flesh), but I have been looking for a cheaper alternative for the time being. I tried e.l.f.&#x27;s Studio Flawless Finish on a whim and was very disappointed in how that turned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I browsed around on NYX&#x27;s website and decided to check out what they had to offer for my face. I had tried many other products of theirs ranging from eye liner to lipstick, but never this kind of stuff. After reading a lot of the reviews, I gave in and decided to order it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know if Nude would have too much pink or yellow/orangey hues, but overall I am really impressed with how well it matched up with my fair skin. It&#x27;s a really good color, and it blended in really nice and gave me a real smooth look. I paired it with their HD primer, and the results exceeded way above my expectations. No shine (even in photos with the flash on) and no greasy feeling. Best of all? No &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEADS UP: It is a light product, so don&#x27;t expect it to cover everything upon applying it to your face. Especially if you have blemishes or dark circles. NYX has several concealers that will get that job done for you that are very reasonably priced. Also, if you want a very even look, get yourself a good foundation brush. A little goes a long way when you have on of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely purchase more NYX product in the future. It&#x27;s a really good value for the look I try to achieve. I will always love my high end cosmetic lines (WHEN I can treat myself to them), but this is a really great addition to my foundations that I can see myself using a lot.</li>
    <li> This stuff is garbage. If you put it on lightly it doesn&#x27;t cover up anything, you try to build it up it flakes off. Would not recommend, complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> a little less coverage than I expected but I&#x27;m sure you can build it up. the lightest color fits my skin tone perfectly and I&#x27;m practically albino</li>
    <li> It is not at all oily, and it goes on like a dream. I use a buffing brush after I finish applying it to even it out, otherwise you will have lines all over your face. One bottle lasts me about 2 months, I use 2 pumps each morning.</li>
    <li> I have tried every kind of foundation out there and this is the only kind that&#x27;s ever given me a rash! It caused me to break out (which hardly happens to me anymore) and I had little dry itchy spots on my face! It had a very strong chemical smell when I first used it. I stopped after two days because I had such an awful reaction to it! It could be that I had a defective bottle. If you are going to order it, \\&quot;nude\\&quot; was a perfect shade for my skin and I wear \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; in Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay. Besides the reaction I had to this, the foundation gave me light to medium coverage and didn&#x27;t last as long as my colorstay foundation. Beware if you buy this!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Ulta first in 03 Natural - and it&#x27;s just a bit dark for this time of year for me. I love the way this looks and wears - medium , slightly luminous coverage, and looks like the way more expensive HD foundations such as Smashbox and Makeup Forever.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had a better color range as the darker the shades, the more yellow they get, and I am a neutral beige. For reference I&#x27;m MAC W25 and I&#x27;m hoping the Nude will not be too light, so I ordered that from here - if it is to light,  I&#x27;ll mix it with the 03 Natural.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any strong odor from it, my guess she DID get a bad batch - but if I have any problems, I&#x27;ll get on here and amend this review.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for being on camera. I got Nude and then got Sand Beige because Nude was too light. Sand Beige is too dark. I mix them together or  use them to contour.</li>
    <li> My new favorite make up!</li>
    <li> I really like this foundation!  It goes on easily, blends well, &amp; doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines or pores.  It has buildable coverage that doesn&#x27;t get smeary and weird.  The finish is between matte and dewy.  And it doesn&#x27;t look like a mask.  Also, it cleans off easily and doesn&#x27;t appear to be staining my white washcloths the way some other foundations have.</li>
    <li> Great finish. Doesn&#x27;t smell gross like a lot of foundations on the market. Looks great in any kind of lighting. Not cakey at all! I&#x27;m used to a thicker, heavier coverage but this is beautiful on.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I must say that I&#x27;m a gal with a VERY fair complexion. I was born with a condition called Ocular Albinism and it has left with me very, VERY little pigment in my skin. Therefore, no tanning for this chick. So, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for great skin case products for us porcelain skinned ladies. NYX has exceeded my expectations! The HD Foundation in Nude is spot on. Great coverage. Paired with the HD studio primer leaves me fully covered all day. TRY IT! :))</li>
    <li> I loveeeeeee this foundation. It works so good, blends well and the color is perfect for my skin! I am very fair so it&#x27;s hard to find foundation hat looks natural without too pigmented making it look like Im wearing a mask. The only two things I did not like about it was the price and the size. I wear foundation on a daily basis, so this won&#x27;t last very long for someone like me. If you wear it occasionally then it is definitely worth the money. But for this amount, I would have rather paid for one that was larger so it would last longer. Other than that it&#x27;s perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m inly giving this 3 stars because I broke out in a very itchy rash after wearing this for only 2 hours but that being said if you don&#x27;t tend to be sensitive then this has good coverage and isn&#x27;t too matte. The color works great on fair skin.</li>
    <li> good product, although i could have used a little more coverage.  It is nice to find a foundation that is actually light enough for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good foundation.  It&#x27;s comparable to Make Up Forever HD foundation.  I think it&#x27;s just as good.  This one has a bit of yellow undertones though which may be a problem if you&#x27;re more pink.  I find that it lasts as long and does the same job as the more expensive brands.  You don&#x27;t need much to cover and can build if needed.  I think it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I have finally, after years of searching, found a drugstore foundation that is pale enough and doesn&#x27;t turn orange after putting it on! For reference on the color, I found Revlon Colorstay foundation in the lightest shade too dark/orange for my skin. I would give it 5 stars except for a few things. Here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Shade is perfect-- neutral, not too orange&lt;br /&gt;Can be built up for medium-full coverage, or put on lightly for sheer coverage&lt;br /&gt;Bottle has a pump, makes it very easy to dispense&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Staying power is good, I just use a matte powder over it and it lasts all day (despite slightly oily skin in my T-zone)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Slightly pricey compared to other drugstore brands, but I just use a $3.50 off Ulta coupon and it makes it better&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance! The fragrance is pretty strong. Not bad, but I really don&#x27;t like scented makeup, as it&#x27;s a potential irritant. However, it wouldn&#x27;t stop me from buying it again.</li>
    <li> funny smell but decent foundation</li>
    <li> great LIGHT cover for daily use love it really makes my skin glows with light cover and long last&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to buy this foundation because of the mixed reviews. I have dry skin and really wanted a foundation that did not settle on my dry spots. I am very pleased with the foundation and actually prefer it over my Nars sheer glow foundation that I paid over $40 for. Also the foundation lasts all day without a primer. I am officially hooked!</li>
    <li> This makeup was purchased for my daughter.  She was not too pleased.  She said there was not the coverage she expected from the product.</li>
    <li> I love NYX products and this one is a good one. Great for very pale people like my daughter who is a ginger. I bought this for her and it matches her complexion. We have tried dozens of foundations and nothing was matching. Love this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this just to see if it lived up the hype. It honestly surpassed my expectations and ended up replacing my expensive Kat Von Dee Lock-It Tattoo Foundation. The coverage of this was heavy enough to cover imperfections but light enough to not look cakey and crease. And the price really seals the deal. Very happy with my impulse purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still trying to find the right moisturizer to combine with this foundation and the NYX primer bc so far it shows the details of my skin even MORE than my drug store foundation. This is an experiment that I must perfect for an upcoming wedding.</li>
    <li> I was not at all familiar with this brand at all and took a chance and bought it and WOW , wha a surprise!! Goes on so smoothly and received several compliments on it, try it and you will see for yourself!</li>
    <li> I like the formula, it&#x27;s light and gives good coverage. Unfortunately, this color was just too light for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent tone for my  fair skin. Good price, packaging and amount for your money. I would recommend NYX products  anytime. I also like this particular foundation. It helps eliminate dark circles or bags!</li>
    <li> This is just plain old foundation. Not worth the price. It goes on very dry. It makes dry skin show up a lot.</li>
    <li> ITS AN OKAY FOUNDATION , I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE BETTER BUT ITS AVERAGE ITS DEF NOT MY GO TO FOUNDATION .. I MUCH PERFER THE COVERGIRL OUTLAST FABULOUS FOUNDATION OR THE LOREAL TRUE MATCH.. THIS IS JUST OKAY.</li>
    <li> This foundation is great with one caveat - it has such pink undertones that I cannot find a match for my skin. Even if I mix colors. Also, the swatches online look nothing like the actual stuff. However, if you have pink undertones it&#x27;s a nice foundation. It&#x27;s buildable and somehow manages to still look like skin. I took one star off because it seems to break me out if I wear it for a few days in a row.</li>
    <li> I have acne and scarring I have used pretty much everything out there makeup wise, this product was just OK... I mean it covered up the marks and everything but after maybe and hour or two it would start to come off. My face felt oily and was really shiny even though I use powder over top. It also felt heavy on my skin and if you sweat or cry or anything like that and somehow it got into your mouth the taste was nasty..lol&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it BUT I wasn&#x27;t a fan... it did worked ok for about an hour of wear. I&#x27;m still looking tho.</li>
    <li> this is a great full coverage foundation.  It doesn&#x27;t get sticky.  I purchased it with the primer and my skin looks absolutely amazing.  I will definetly rebuy this item</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently been using NYX&#x27;s Stay Matte But Not Flat liquid foundation and decided to give this one a try.  It&#x27;s slightly more expensive but nothing compared to some foundations I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I love this foundation.  It&#x27;s not as heavy as Stay Matte but still provides good coverage without being cakey at all.  It blends very well with my contour and highlight concealers and leaves my skin slightly dewey, but not sticky or slippery.  Finally, I have quite fair skin with pinkish undertones and have a hard time finding a good match that isn&#x27;t too yellow or too orange and this matches perfectly.  I&#x27;ll be using it for quite some time.</li>
    <li> Really not a fan of this at all. I bought a tube, and the only reason I keep using it is because I don&#x27;t want to drive all the way back to Ulta to return it.&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;2. It leaves my face looking and feeling greasy in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;3. It wears off by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;4. It feels super heavy.</li>
    <li> Does not cover well at all</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on time but was hopping something different the texture is too fluid and doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
    <li> This makeup is wonderful. The shade was a perfect match. I have combo skin and was nervous I would be shiny. Nope the foundation lasted 12 hours me running around at work. There was no shine and I looked amazing at 4am. I did not even need to touch up at all. This is worth the price for every drop.</li>
    <li> I really love this foundation, the best drugstore foundation I&#x27;ve tried(and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT!). It&#x27;s light to medium coverage. I have combination to oily skin and this foundation doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or add to it&#x27;s oiliness.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than a lot of more expensive brands.</li>
