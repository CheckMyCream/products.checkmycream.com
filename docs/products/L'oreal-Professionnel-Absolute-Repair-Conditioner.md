      <li>My hair is so smooth, my search is over.</li>
      <li>and this conditioner makes it silky smooth.</li>
      <li>the bottle top should be easier to use, such as a pump or pop top opener!</li>
      <li>After using the lactic acid line for nearly a year now-even my stylist has commented on how much more healthy my hair feels and looks.</li>
      <li>This did not even clean my hair.  </li>
      <li>Right!</li>
      <li>So for several years I have felt like the twin without the good hair genes.</li>
      <li>It is fair enough.</li>
      <li>I was able to return it for a new bottle.</li>
      <li>You can see the results after the first time!</li>
      <li>but so worth it.</li>

      <li>so my hair tends to get very dry on top of it being highlighted.  </li>
      <li>The lactic acid formula really does work to plump and condition the strands of the hair.</li>
      <li>My wife uses this conditioner and we buy it through Amazon because of the reasonable price.</li>
      <li>If you have very damaged hair like me, you will like it.</li>
      <li>What a huge difference compared to other conditioners.</li>
      <li>and I had to immediately go out and buy new shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It makes me hair so soft and smooth, and really feels less damaged (</li>
      <li>I have my hair colored professionally every 4 weeks</li>
      <li>I always have to put the product into another container or old conditioner bottle</li>

<li> Product delivered on time and as expected.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t get a brush through my hair without it and even though my stylist and her salon use other products now, at home,  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my hair.</li>

<li> but it seems silly not to include a pump with every order.</li>
<li> Expensive</li>

    <li> this stuff is great! makes your hair so silky smooth and smells great too!</li>
    <li> the bottle top should be easier to use, such as a pump or pop top opener! I always have to put the product into another container or old conditioner bottle</li>
    <li> good price for this product</li>
    <li> What a huge difference compared to other conditioners. My hair is so smooth, my search is over. 😄</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel but conditions my hair perfectly.  Other conditioners don&#x27;t seem to do as good of a job.  I purchased the shampoo and conditioner last time and one of them leaked in shipping. It was packed in a plastic bag so it didn&#x27;t leak anywhere but the bag. I was able to return it for a new bottle.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this conditioner and we buy it through Amazon because of the reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic everyday conditioner, I use it with the matching shampoo and the masque 2x a month!</li>
    <li> Amazing conditioner.  Have been using it for years on my naturally blonde but highlighted hair.  I surf so my hair tends to get very dry on top of it being highlighted.  Always come back to this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should be noted though- that the seller doesn&#x27;t include a pump for this HUGE bottle which is a major disappointment.</li>
    <li> I have color treated, over gray hair which is very dry.  This conditioner is wonderful and truly makes my hair feel silky and look shiny.</li>
    <li> Best colored shampoo out there compared to pureology! Pureology is great but it is the stinkiest shampoo and conditioner out there! This shampoo and conditioner is amazing and well worth the price-it leaves my hair looking amazing just like my pureology color care shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> If you have very damaged hair like me, you will like it. It is a well working product but when you will finish using it your hair will be back to previous condition.</li>
    <li> Great product and  fast delivery</li>
    <li> The bottle should come with a pump to get the conditioner out.  I had to purchase one separately and use that one instead.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It is fantastic. My hair is always silky, soft, and shiny. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since using this product.</li>
    <li> fav conditioner in the WORLD! I have been using it for years. It is the best of all L&#x27;oreal and makes my very long hair  stay beautiful and strong without split ends. When I stop using it then my hair gets splits and not a lovely.</li>
    <li> My friend came to visit me, and she uses this same shampoo &amp; conditioner, so I used some of hers to experience, and I love it, so i decided to buy it. I bought the shampoo and conditioner. However; the shampoo or the conditioner made my hair is sticky together, and dry now. Very hard to brush. I never had this problem before, I am really disappointed at this product because I was very excited to  get it, and it is so expensive. Also, the smell seems to give me headache as well. I WILL NEVER BUY IT AGAIN, AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT (at least from here).&lt;br /&gt;BTW - I had to buy the anti residue shampoo to give me peace again.</li>
    <li> It has changed my hair for the better! I totally recommend this conditioner!</li>
    <li> Doesnt worth the price and i stopped to used it after i did my keratin because this is not sulfatew free</li>
    <li> Love the prodcut and it goes a very long ways.  It makes your hair shine and feel so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service</li>
    <li> This product, when purchased at a salon, was great. I am hesitant however with the authenticity of the product in this bottle. Previously I never had issues but in using this product- everywhere this product touches my skin gets irritated. I read recently that if any bottle has a sticker sku, that it&#x27;s imitation. This product had a sticker sku...</li>
    <li> Got to me so fast! A+++</li>
    <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> Found out this is what they use at the salon.  Works better for me than any keratin product.</li>
    <li> I have fine, color treated hair and this is simply the best product I&#x27;ve ever used! The lactic acid formula really does work to plump and condition the strands of the hair. I get great volume but also a lot of softness. I&#x27;ve literally tried dozens of pro grade shampoo/conditioners and have never found one that measures up to this one. After using the lactic acid line for nearly a year now-even my stylist has commented on how much more healthy my hair feels and looks. This line also has the most wonderful smell to it- I even get compliments on how my hair smells sometimes. I love, love, love this product-try it and you&#x27;ll be addicted, too!</li>
    <li> I have dry damaged relaxed hair that was breaking no matter what I did.  After just one application of this brand shampoo, conditioner and mask, the moisture as returned, my hair is not breaking anymore and is so soft now.  Will continue to use this brand.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner  is just amaxing and leave my hair so soft  and shine</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the absolut repair shampoo and it keep my hair very healthy and stops it from breaking. I use straighteners and blow dry my hair every couple of days, with it being dyed blonde I need a good conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great at keeping it full of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this does NOT come with a pump.</li>
    <li> Product delivered on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> Very happy  with order. I love the product, well worth the money.  restored my hair to baby soft after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> I like this, but the mask is much better.</li>
    <li> Great product works well with my hair</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! You can see the results after the first time! I just loved it! Try to use the mascara also, is great!</li>
    <li> My twin sister&#x27;s hair always looked nice WITHOUT curling it or straightening it. She said it was her shampoo &amp; conditioner that worked on the cellular level. Right! How could shampoo &amp; conditioner do that? My hair always needs some heat after blow drying to look nice. So for several years I have felt like the twin without the good hair genes. Dang her.&lt;br /&gt;But then I decided to do my own experiment, borrowing some of her \\&quot;magic\\&quot; potions. I tried my shampoo with this conditioner, but that didn&#x27;t do the trick alone. Somehow the matching shampoo &amp; conditioner work their magic together. Now I am a true believer! Saved from having to use a flat iron. My hair is soft &amp; shiny &amp; with relatively no frizz or split ends wreaking havoc (at least not enough to do anything about it except use this shampoo &amp; conditioner). And my hair will only get healthier from using no additional heat appliances. I like that. And I appreciate my sister for once again sharing her potions &amp; experiences with me.  She&#x27;s the best! And so is this conditioner &amp; the matching shampoo. Amazon had the best prices for both. Expensive but so worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product that is not sold in many stores. It works very good on my type of hair and comes in a good larger size.</li>
    <li> I have my hair colored professionally every 4 weeks and this product was recommended by my stylist. I have thick wavy hair that tangles and knots up and this conditioner makes it silky smooth. I couldn&#x27;t get a brush through my hair without it and even though my stylist and her salon use other products now, at home,  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my hair. The only downside is they don&#x27;t include a pump with the product. I always sheepishly ask my hair salon for one which they obliging do but it seems silly not to include a pump with every order.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner! It makes me hair so soft and smooth, and really feels less damaged (although I know nothing short of cutting the damage off will actually &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; it, this is about the next best thing).</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner were awful.  Not at all what they sell in salons.  This did not even clean my hair.  It left a very greasy residue and I had to immediately go out and buy new shampoo and conditioner.  I would only recommend buy this product in salons.  I am returning asap.</li>
    <li> I love Loreal Series!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is thin blonde and dry - this is light weight and non greasy and makes my hair so soft I love it</li>
