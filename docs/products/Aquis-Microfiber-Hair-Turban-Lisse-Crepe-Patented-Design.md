      <li>The best hair turban out there.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the best towel I&#x27;ve used for my hair.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still doing the job perfectly.</li>
      <li>This thing is awesome!</li>
      <li>It works perfectly.</li>
      <li>and I think it is an excellent gift to yourself or someone else.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It needs to be washed about once every two weeks and works beautifully!</li>
      <li>For best results, I apply my products before putting my hair up in the turban.  </li>
      <li>The best hair turban ever!</li>
      <li>I have curly hair, and the Aquis turban is great for preventing frizz, and keeps my hair out of the way while dressing.  </li>
      <li>this works great for the hair</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Packaging was fine, delivery was great too!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think the BEST feature on this is the elasticized sides which REALLY help this to stay on my head.</li>
      <li>Wonderful, and when they get older use them for car drying towels.  </li>
      <li>And, I am so glad this is my first one because it is great.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the turban because I do swim and</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>NOthing better.</li>
      <li>The material feels sturdier and it does a pretty good job drying my hair.</li>
      <li>It also makes a good (unusual) gift.</li>
      <li>It is easy to put on and stays in place until you take it off.</li>
      <li>I love these hair towels, great for long hair regardless of the type.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s just me being super picky!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really great, especially in the summer.</li>
      <li>I love the hair turban -- it is much lighter than a towel and stays on my head.</li>
      <li>In hotels the towels are either too small or too large to use as a turban, so these are great because they absorb beautifully and dry quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice not to have a giant floppy towel on my head that falls off and unravels.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and fit&#x27;s secure on my head, wicking away water so that hair is not damp.</li>
      <li>and I can finally use the towel for my body which is great because I don&#x27;t have to lug a heavier towel around to get the same type of performance I get with the microfiber one.</li>
      <li>Quality seams good but, unless you have a LOT of hair AND a large head this will probably not fit.</li>
      <li>Who wants to have hot dryer facing you for 25 minutes in this heat.</li>
      <li>Make sure to let it air dry after each use (I hang it on my door hook).</li>
      <li>It makes drying with the hair dryer so much easier because the hair is so much dryer already.  </li>
      <li>Snug fit with elastic around entire cloth.</li>
      <li>This is a quick and secure way to get your hair out of the way without dripping or weighing you down.</li>
      <li>It is larger than most turbans and will work for women with larger than normal heads or if you have a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>But other than that the towel is soft and it&#x27;s a good size, even for long hair.</li>
      <li>Speeds dry time significantly if you wait about 10-15 min</li>
      <li>The towel is very soft, but the button makes it more difficult than it should be to secure the towel.</li>
      <li>I previously purchased a turban from Big Lots and it did the job for the most part.</li>
      <li>It really absorbs the water and just twist your hair in the front and button the turban in the back.</li>
      <li>I was using an old off brand hair turban, and now that I&#x27;ve ordered and used this one, I am throwing my old one in the trash.</li>
      <li>When putting it on, I don&#x27;t really have to squeeze the water out of her hair, the 2-3 twists to get the towel around her hair before putting the loop on the button is enough</li>
      <li>I have used many hair turbans over the years, and have had long long hair and medium short hair.</li>
      <li>She likes it very much, puts it on after shampooing and dresses while the turban soaks up the moisture and her hair begins to dry.</li>
      <li>Bought it for my 8-year old whose hair is just past her shoulder blades, medium thickness, and it is fine for her.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Highly recommend, I hang mine a large plastic cost hanger to dry after I use it.</li>
      <li>Really does dry hair faster.</li>
      <li>have used these for years and they are high quality and last throughout several washings &amp; years.</li>
      <li>My other hair towel just has an elastic loop that I have to push it through, and that is much easier.</li>
      <li>I put this turban on and in a few minutes my hair is considerably drier and ready for styling.  </li>

<li> I purchased this as a gift for a family member who has long hair.  </li>
<li> Agree with the other reviewers that this is not for a big head.</li>
<li> It soaks up the water in my long hair almost immediately!  </li>
<li> I can just wear it after shower, do other things for 15 minutes, then the blow dry takes only 5 minutes!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the towel to dry my hair since then.  </li>
<li> I often put my make-up on before I dry my hair and this makes it esay.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other turbans but they left my hair still really wet.  </li>
<li> this would not be big enough for my wife, she has very thick long blonde hair.</li>
<li> They cost a few bucks extra but it is the best!&lt;br</li>
<li> It cuts down on drying time by half!  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little cheaper on here</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it for a year everyday</li>
<li> Then she gets herself dried, dressed and by the time the Aquis comes off, there is no water dripping on her shirt at all.</li>
<li> I purchased two of these turbans (I&#x27;ve already had one for a few years) to pack in my suitcases for travel.</li>
<li> I have recommended this to friends who have thick hair like mine.</li>
<li> Been using these hair towels ever since they came out at least 20 yrs ago!</li>

    <li> Buy this! It works perfectly. Snug fit with elastic around entire cloth. Really does dry hair faster. I was using an old off brand hair turban, and now that I&#x27;ve ordered and used this one, I am throwing my old one in the trash. This thing is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a head towel before.  And, I am so glad this is my first one because it is great.  It soaks up the water in my long hair almost immediately!  It makes drying with the hair dryer so much easier because the hair is so much dryer already.  I love it.  Wish I had discovered it before!!</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these turbans (I&#x27;ve already had one for a few years) to pack in my suitcases for travel. In hotels the towels are either too small or too large to use as a turban, so these are great because they absorb beautifully and dry quickly.</li>

    <li> Agree with the other reviewers that this is not for a big head. Bought it for my 8-year old whose hair is just past her shoulder blades, medium thickness, and it is fine for her.  When she get out of the bath/shower, this goes on her head. Then she gets herself dried, dressed and by the time the Aquis comes off, there is no water dripping on her shirt at all. When putting it on, I don&#x27;t really have to squeeze the water out of her hair, the 2-3 twists to get the towel around her hair before putting the loop on the button is enough the get the water out.  If I did that with a regular towel, the back of her shirt will be damp after she gets dressed.  I bought the regular hair towel for myself (I have short hair) and that works for me. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I previously purchased a turban from Big Lots and it did the job for the most part. I feel like this towel just goes one extra step.  The material feels sturdier and it does a pretty good job drying my hair.</li>

    <li> Been using these hair towels ever since they came out at least 20 yrs ago! They&#x27;re so well made I&#x27;m only onmy 3rd one and that&#x27;s only b/c Ieft one in the hotel!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other turbans but they left my hair still really wet.  I put this turban on and in a few minutes my hair is considerably drier and ready for styling.  It is easy to put on and stays in place until you take it off.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with the expectation that I wouldn&#x27;t have to spend as long blow drying my hair.  It cuts down on drying time by half!  The only thing that I don&#x27;t care for is that it slips back on my head a bit but that&#x27;s just me being super picky!  I have recommended this to friends who have thick hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I was concerned this would not be big enough for my wife, she has very thick long blonde hair. It is larger than most turbans and will work for women with larger than normal heads or if you have a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> NOthing better. Wrap your hair in this before blowdrying your hair. Speeds dry time significantly if you wait about 10-15 min</li>
    <li> I saw this in Bed, Bath and Beyond then I decided to check the price on Amazon. It&#x27;s a little cheaper on here so I purchased one to try out. I wash my hair everyday and it normally takes 20-25 minutes to blow dry with water dripping everywhere. This turban is my saviour! I can just wear it after shower, do other things for 15 minutes, then the blow dry takes only 5 minutes! It&#x27;s really great, especially in the summer. Who wants to have hot dryer facing you for 25 minutes in this heat. I&#x27;ve used it for a year everyday and it&#x27;s still doing the job perfectly.</li>

    <li> I like this towel and use it every time when I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter likes it too.&lt;br /&gt;We both have long hair.</li>

    <li> I have had a towel made by Aquis that I got YEARS ago when I worked for Bath and Body Works as they sold these items for a season.  Anyhow, I had also purchased a hair turban which I used and then I don&#x27;t know what happened to it.  I&#x27;ve been using the towel to dry my hair since then.  I LOVE the turban because I do swim and this works great for the hair and I can finally use the towel for my body which is great because I don&#x27;t have to lug a heavier towel around to get the same type of performance I get with the microfiber one.</li>
