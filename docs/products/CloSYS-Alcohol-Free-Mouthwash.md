      <li>Best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>GREAT DENTAL VISITS</li>
      <li>Product is great.</li>
      <li>I am also very satisfied this this product.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is like rinsing with water, but after you get used to it, is much more pleasant.</li>
      <li>It is okay.</li>
      <li>This mouthwash is a great alternative to over-the-counter products, and it&#x27;s much cheaper from Amazon than from my dentist.</li>
      <li>Love not having a strong taste to this.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is sulfate free.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>My mouth is almost plaque free since I began rinsing with Closys twice a day.</li>
      <li>I add the whole tiny bottle to the 32 oz one &amp; it&#x27;s perfect for my taste.</li>
      <li>Most toothpastes burn so much they are intolerable.</li>
      <li>and my mouth always feels fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Quick ship</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine what makes this so much more effective than other mouthwashes</li>
      <li>even when they&#x27;re in dental products--so I really appreciate a product that is totally free of them.</li>
      <li>my dentist wants me to use it daily so it does work good for gums...</li>
      <li>I have followed his advice for nearly 10 years and am glad.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have a dental appointment next week for cleaning, and I know they will be able to tell the difference.  </li>
      <li>I know these items are a bit pricey, but it is worth it in the long run to keep my teeth and mouth healthy.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping thanks and</li>
      <li>(it tastes like there&#x27;s nothing in it but water), but I would have thought I gargled with bleach because my mouth feels so much cleaner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
      <li>WOW it&#x27;s been 3 months</li>
      <li>My mouth sucks, and most days I wish God had given me two anuses</li>
      <li>MY PERIDONTAL DISEASE IS MARKEDLY IMPROVED WITH THE WASH.</li>
      <li>The peppermint oil is in a separate tiny bottle so you can add as much as desired - or none at all.</li>
      <li>No harsh alcohol in this.</li>
      <li>wish the price was more reasonable since all the other mouthwashes out there are dirt cheap and will get you drunk, but there is nothing else that works as well and is as tolerable as this product.</li>
      <li>It does not have much of a taste which I was quite use to from other products.</li>
      <li>It really keeps my periodontal disease at bay (according to my dentist), and the optional peppermint flavoring prevents any odd aftertaste.</li>
      <li>It was a little strange at first, since I was use to minty type mouthwash that burned and foamed.</li>
      <li>Guess it works killing the germs and bad stuff, I have had good checkups at the dentist every since.</li>

    <li> Best mouthwash ever! I know chemo patients that don&#x27;t get mouth sores the way everybody else does because they use this mouthwash. Fantastic product. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> recommended by my dentist. Use daily no problems.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know what the heck is wrong with my mouth, but it is extremely sensitive. My mouth is also extremely dry, so much that even Biotene products (oral products for xerostomia) are worthless. Most toothpastes burn so much they are intolerable. Alcohol containing mouthwashes are literally painful. I don&#x27;t believe Internet rumors, but sulfide containing toothpastes do seem to cause me aphthous ulcers. My mouth sucks, and most days I wish God had given me two anuses instead.&lt;br /&gt;But even with a mouth this sensitive, I can tolerate this mouthwash as well as I do plain water. I can&#x27;t imagine what makes this so much more effective than other mouthwashes (it tastes like there&#x27;s nothing in it but water), but I would have thought I gargled with bleach because my mouth feels so much cleaner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the price was more reasonable since all the other mouthwashes out there are dirt cheap and will get you drunk, but there is nothing else that works as well and is as tolerable as this product.</li>
    <li> Love not having a strong taste to this. seems to work well</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping thanks and my dentist wants me to use it daily so it does work good for gums...</li>
    <li> Product is great. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake that I did and get ripped off by Amazon on the 2 pack. They get $29.45 for the 2 pack ($14.72 each) and $10.99 each if you buy the each.</li>

    <li> Less trips to the dentist since I started to use this mouthwash.  It was recommended by my dentist.  No harsh alcohol in this.</li>
    <li> My periodontist recommended that I use this daily. I am.</li>
    <li> I have periodontal problems and read the reviews so I thought I&#x27;d try it. WOW it&#x27;s been 3 months and I can totally tell the difference of my gums. I luv this product. I even recommended it to my daughters&#x27; Dentist! I have a dental appointment next week for cleaning, and I know they will be able to tell the difference.  A must have in your dental hygiene. I forgot to mention I also use the CloSYS toothpaste. This toothpaste is sulfate free. No Foaming at the mouth.  It doesn&#x27;t contain the sulfate that makes your shampoo bubbly. Goodbye Crest, Colgate etc. I know these items are a bit pricey, but it is worth it in the long run to keep my teeth and mouth healthy.</li>
    <li> RECOMMENDED BY A DENTIST. MY PERIDONTAL DISEASE IS MARKEDLY IMPROVED WITH THE WASH. I&#x27;VE NOW BOUGHT THE TOOTHPASTE ALSO. GREAT DENTAL VISITS SINCE I STARTED USING THEM. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist&#x27;s office &amp; I&#x27;ve used it faithfully the past few years. The peppermint oil is in a separate tiny bottle so you can add as much as desired - or none at all. I add the whole tiny bottle to the 32 oz one &amp; it&#x27;s perfect for my taste. Never any burn with CloSYS. It&#x27;s well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommends this mouthwash for daily use. I have followed his advice for nearly 10 years and am glad. My gums are in great shape (at age 71!) and my mouth always feels fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> It does not have much of a taste which I was quite use to from other products. It is okay.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my dentist. It takes a little getting used to, but it seems to help my gums and teeth. It doesn&#x27;t burn like other mouthwash. It takes a few weeks to feel the healing process.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Quick ship</li>
    <li> Helps with bad breath. I use this as my day mouth wash.</li>
    <li> This is a dental care secret too few people know about. My mouth is almost plaque free since I began rinsing with Closys twice a day. Combined with a Sonicare, the results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It has no alcohol burn (or any taste at all), but they give you a little bottle of mint oil you can add if you like.</li>
    <li> I am also very satisfied this this product.  So is my dentist  he sells the same item.</li>
