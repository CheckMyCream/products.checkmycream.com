      <li>Received the product in a very timely manner.  </li>
      <li>It was also reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>So when I did an Amazon search for &amp;#34;orange concealer&amp;#34;, much to my surprise, this Graftobian concealer popped up.</li>

      <li>This is one of my favorite concealers for hiding my dark under eye circles!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s slightly greasy, but setting it should prevent it from getting in fine lines.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works great and lasts a long time as a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>I use it for my under eye circles and it covers the blue bags very well.</li>
      <li>my Boss was like wow</li>
      <li>But as far as the bluish circles are concerned, they have been well covered with this corrector.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t go a day without my Graftobian HD Crème Foundation Corrector in Soft Orange.</li>
      <li>I am my own worse critic.</li>
      <li>Only complaint is that the rim on the lid and clear top were separated when I received the product.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased the Graftobian HD Creme Corrector in Soft Orange.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this product to cover up my dark circles</li>
      <li>not dry. .. .. ..</li>
      <li>I have very dark circles, and it covers them  pretty well.</li>
      <li>I am Asian and this is the only thing that really works in covering my dark under eye bags.  </li>
      <li>But for blue dark circles, I highly recommend this neutralizing corrector.  </li>

<li> , I use this product, and then only need a very tiny amount of the other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
<li> My skin is light, but not fair so the orange tint is a little noticeable in daylight, so it definitely needs a little tweaking.</li>
<li> , my under eye circles are not only dark brown all time  the time and when I don&#x27;t get rest they  turn purple.</li>
<li> my under gets ready dry and everything I have used makes that problem worse</li>

<li> Ordered the same one in green for blemishes.</li>
<li> This is an inexpensive and highly effective product to help cover those annoying dark circles.</li>
<li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> It is difficult to find an orange concealer for a reasonable price.</li>
<li> I use this corrector for my dark circles every day...</li>
<li> If you have dark eye bags, you need this!  </li>
<li> A little dab will do ya.</li>
<li> I also use a tissue to dab the under eye area to catch any oil left behind.</li>
<li> A little goes a LONG way, so though it is slightly expensive, this little pot lasts a very long time!</li>
<li> I apply with a small brush and usually wear under tinted moisturizer, foundation or powder.  </li>
<li> no more looking for me,,,thanks graftobian</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried Laura Mercier (too dry and not orange enough), Bobbi Brown (creased terribly), Napoleon Perdis (too orange, too dewy) and NYX (way too orange, like a pumpkin).  </li>
<li> I am a man, and use it under my eyes and in the mustache/beard area where I have been having a difficult time concealing my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s too expensive, so</li>
<li> I have bluish undereye circles that are driving me crazy.  </li>
<li> It helps neutralize my nasty bags and darkness under my eyes, and helps correct any hyperpigmentation and discoloration I may have.</li>

    <li> Where have you been all my life? I love this stuff so much! It helps neutralize my nasty bags and darkness under my eyes, and helps correct any hyperpigmentation and discoloration I may have. The consistency of the product is uber creamy and not at all cakey. Can&#x27;t go a day without my Graftobian HD Crème Foundation Corrector in Soft Orange.</li>
    <li> After tons and tons of concealer&#x27;s this is is it I found the one..no more looking for me,,,thanks graftobian you are the chosen one👍</li>
    <li> Apply your foundation, then lightly brush this smooth soft orange blue neutralizer over your beard area and your facial hair shadow will easily be concealed.  Cover this and blend with your favorite bronzer and you&#x27;re good to go. Or, use this first and then your foundation.. either way, it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great and lasts a long time as a small amount goes a long way.  I prefer Paula Dorf Blue Neutralizer, but at only 1/2 oz for $23 it&#x27;s too expensive, so, I use this product, and then only need a very tiny amount of the other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also works on covering up tattoos, blue veins and under the eye circles</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Graftobian HD Creme Corrector in Soft Orange. It was the 1/4 oz. size. I must say it does a fairly good job. I have very dark circles, and it covers them  pretty well. The only thing you should remember is to set it with a loose powder. It&#x27;s slightly greasy, but setting it should prevent it from getting in fine lines. I also use a tissue to dab the under eye area to catch any oil left behind. All in all it&#x27;s a pretty good corrector, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I had been using this as a concealer and a contour color for a while now and I love it.It blends so smoothly and does not dry out my skin.I use this with traditional and airbrush foundations.Not bad for the price either so I bought two of them.</li>
    <li> Look no further. This is an inexpensive and highly effective product to help cover those annoying dark circles. Warm it up a bit before using and blend using your fingers.</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer I have ever used.  Matches my skin perfectly.  Will keep buying!</li>
    <li> I have used every kind of concelear and nothing has worked like this. I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to make something work for my eyes. I am Latina and I have olive skin, my under eye circles are not only dark brown all time  the time and when I don&#x27;t get rest they  turn purple. It covers everything! I do use a concelear on top for extra coverage but don&#x27;t really need it. It&#x27;s a bit greasy but that&#x27;s what I love about it my under gets ready dry and everything I have used makes that problem worse but this does not. I never write reviews but this I had to share.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite concealers for hiding my dark under eye circles! The salmon-orange tint is good for medium skin tones and has medium coverage so it can be layered under your foundation to highlight and brighten your under eye area! A little goes a LONG way, so though it is slightly expensive, this little pot lasts a very long time!</li>
    <li> Love this concealer, great for dark circles under eyes.  Haven&#x27;t found anything else as good. Ordered the same one in green for blemishes. love it.</li>
    <li> Good for correcting bluish colour under eye. Blendable and plenty of product for your dollar. I place product under concealer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than Laura Mercier corrector.&lt;br /&gt;Good Cover and not crease like othor products.&lt;br /&gt;Soft not dry. .. .. ..</li>
    <li> I watch youtube makeup guru Wayne Goss often and he touts Graftobian foundation as being the best there is.  I have bluish undereye circles that are driving me crazy.  I&#x27;ve tried many concealers but none have given me much relief.  Then I discovered that orange neutralizes the blue and began searching in earnest for an orange concealer.  I&#x27;ve tried Laura Mercier (too dry and not orange enough), Bobbi Brown (creased terribly), Napoleon Perdis (too orange, too dewy) and NYX (way too orange, like a pumpkin).  None of these products did the job.  So when I did an Amazon search for &amp;#34;orange concealer&amp;#34;, much to my surprise, this Graftobian concealer popped up. It was also reasonably priced.  So what did I have to lose?  The first time I tried it I was amazed at how smoothly it went on and how easy it was to blend.  And it did conceal the majority of the blue discoloration.  I set it with translucent powder and it didn&#x27;t crease at all after about 5 hours of wear (I haven&#x27;t tried wearing it longer yet).  I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised.  My skin is light, but not fair so the orange tint is a little noticeable in daylight, so it definitely needs a little tweaking. I&#x27;m now experimenting with perhaps applying a skin toned concealer over it, just a very sheer coat.  But I have to find exactly the right formulation, color and the proper application method in order to do this, so my search goes on.  But as far as the bluish circles are concerned, they have been well covered with this corrector.  All in all, I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase and would perhaps like to try the Graftobian foundation, if I could find a good color match, which is very difficult online.  But for blue dark circles, I highly recommend this neutralizing corrector.  If it can hide my discoloration, it can work for anybody.</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t what i expected. I applied it on my skin and comes out darker with darker circles and cakey</li>
    <li> I use this corrector for my dark circles every day... this is my 5th time ordering this orange corrector...</li>
    <li> Received the product in a very timely manner.  Works great to correct colour (blues).  I am a man, and use it under my eyes and in the mustache/beard area where I have been having a difficult time concealing my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I use liquid foundation on rest of my face, loose powder over everything, and it all blends beautifully.</li>
    <li> If you have dark eye bags, you need this!  The orange counteracts the blue and darkness under your eyes.  It will cover better than using yellow.  Orange is better for olive complexions.  Yellows are great for lighter complexions.  I am Asian and this is the only thing that really works in covering my dark under eye bags.  Orange will do the trick!  This is very light and easily blendable.</li>
    <li> Great for undereye bags. Adore this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent for neutralizing blue/gray under eye circles. It is difficult to find an orange concealer for a reasonable price. A little dab will do ya. Only complaint is that the rim on the lid and clear top were separated when I received the product.</li>
    <li> This is some smooth stuff.  I apply with a small brush and usually wear under tinted moisturizer, foundation or powder.  I have olive toned skin with some hyperpigmentation on my cheeks.  This covers it well...it doesn&#x27;t make it disappear but almost.  And a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use it for my under eye circles and it covers the blue bags very well. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty cool. I am my own worse critic. The first time I used this product to cover up my dark circles my Boss was like wow what did you do differently. You look like you got an eyelift. so it did something amazing to my eyes. It is a great product. My only problem is that I have oily eyes and most things I wear melt off. But again, this product made a difference. Love it.</li>
