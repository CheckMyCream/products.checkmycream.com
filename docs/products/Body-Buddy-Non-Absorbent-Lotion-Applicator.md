### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>So grateful to Body Buddy for making this excellent product, a must-have sanity-saver for me.</li>
      <li>so this works great.</li>
      <li>Another lesson, life is great keep on living.  </li>
      <li>I think this works great for it.</li>
      <li>Works great to apply lotion to those &amp;#34;can&#x27;t reach&amp;#34; spots.</li>
      <li>and I am a fairly skinny person</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this product!</li>
      <li>So glad I bought it!</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this product!  </li>
      <li>It helps apply really easy and smooth and gives a fairly even coverage.</li>
      <li>As others have said, you may have to hold it more closely and ignore the handles.</li>
      <li>At the end of the day, I am glad I have it because it does get the lotion/cream in places I cannot reach.</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and easy to clean after each use.  </li>
      <li>This is a wonderful bath aid to apply lotion to those harder to reach areas.  </li>
      <li>What I love the most is that I can clean the surface easily after application.  </li>
      <li>Not as easy to use as portrayed in product description.</li>
      <li>This works great for distributing lotion on my back evenly.  </li>
      <li>I was a skeptic but it smoothly applies lotion or tanner evenly.</li>
      <li>Amazingly simple design, and very effective.  </li>
      <li>This works so great for quickly applying lotion on your back.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t clean it every time since I use it when I get out of a hot bath.  </li>
      <li>In addition, once you apply the lotion you still cannot massage it into your skin, so you have to stand there naked until lotion soaks into skin on its own or else</li>
      <li>applicator does apply lotion when I can get it in the right angles.</li>
      <li>so different and practical - distributed cream and lotion with ease and easy to maintain and clean up afterwards and store.</li>
      <li>Works very well!</li>
      <li>Makes it easy to put lotion on my back</li>
      <li>My only  gripe with the product is that the handles stretch  out fairly easy  </li>
      <li>Love that I can easily maneuver the lotion to all those hard to read areas.  </li>
      <li>, honestly I am very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The material the applicator is made of makes it easy for me to hand wash and air dry.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>All good...handles a little more elastic than they needed to be.</li>
      <li>Finally, in frustration, I spread the lotion all over the vinyl applicator--and still the vinyl refuses to spread it beyond where it&#x27;s first applied.</li>
      <li>Also I managed to get myself a 2nd degree burn last year trying to garden for the first time, this baby would have really helped out re-applying lotion every 30-60 minutes!</li>
      <li>The stretchy ends give too much flexibility, the applicator twists on my back</li>
      <li>/&gt;The item is thinner so , it doesn&#x27;t cover much of your back in one go, and</li>
      <li>the problem I have is the material it is made is too soft .</li>
      <li>but really this is like a long piece of vinyl with elastic handles.</li>
      <li>, the handle should have been made with a simple hard materiel which would have given the application more rigid support to move it</li>
      <li>Wasnt really what I expected.</li>
      <li>I can use sunscreen or my favorite moisturizer and reach between my shoulder blades and other upper back areas, and due to the non-absorbent fabric of this product, all of the lotion ends up on me, not on the applicator.</li>
      <li>It applies my moisturizer so well, but brrrr, it&#x27;s cold when it first hits my back :)  </li>

<li> This product works very well for its very specific purpose: apply lotion to hard to reach areas of your back without wasting the lotion.</li>
<li> then on top of that the foolish design flaws of using a elastic as a materiel for the handle of a item which you need to move against a rough surface where fictional force is high , i find pretty stupid!</li>
<li> but now that we have opposite schedules I can get out of the shower and not feel dry soon after.</li>
<li> - I&#x27;m not sure how long because I buy extra and store for whenever I want a new one.</li>
<li> Wish I had it a long time ago.</li>
<li> Unlike other products that do the same thing, the lotion does not seep into the product itself.  </li>
<li> It tends to double over on itself unless I hold it very carefully.  </li>
<li> I also like this product because with limited joint flexibility and one shoulder already repaired</li>
<li> Been using this product every single day for years now.</li>
<li> Just a piece of plastic with a hoop on each end and not very well made.</li>
<li> and/or is harder to drag across when you have any lotion on it.</li>
<li> I believe if the handles were cloth with no real give that the lotion would be easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This thing is a disaster and definitely not worth the $.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a fairly recent widow and was troubled on how to put lotion on my back...</li>
<li> The stretchy elastic handles are bad enough and make it harder just to move it around on your back.</li>
<li> the spot between the shoulder blades that is typically unreachable by oneself!</li>
<li> I use a very heavy cream</li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t  complain about product price because nobody forced me to buy it</li>
<li> As others mentioned, the strap handles are useless since they stretch, so I just hold the edges.</li>
<li> But the worst quality and the reason for my 1 star rating is that the vinyl surface (both sides) doesn&#x27;t move and spread the lotion around on your back.</li>
<li> item is feels like a length of pleather (fake leather) attached by two stretchy ends (handles) to pull on.</li>
<li> Gets stuck on your back when your doing a side to side motion to try and rub product in and does a terrible job of rubbing anything on your skin.  </li>
<li> strip of cold plastic</li>
<li> Worthless!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> All good...handles a little more elastic than they needed to be.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for its very specific purpose: apply lotion to hard to reach areas of your back without wasting the lotion. I can use sunscreen or my favorite moisturizer and reach between my shoulder blades and other upper back areas, and due to the non-absorbent fabric of this product, all of the lotion ends up on me, not on the applicator. The elastic bands are sturdy enough to work properly to pull the fabric across my back. If I wanted to grab the fabric ends themselves instead of the elastic bands, I could. I also like this product because with limited joint flexibility and one shoulder already repaired, I don&#x27;t have to strain/fail to reach areas when I can&#x27;t ask my husband to do it for me. I took off one star only because this should be a $10 product, not a $20 product.</li>
    <li> Been using this product every single day for years now. The loops allows me to apply the necessary pressure to &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; oils, butters, or lotions into my back, even though I only have one hand. Each body buddy lasts me between 6 and 11 months before the material starts to fissure/crack - I&#x27;m not sure how long because I buy extra and store for whenever I want a new one. So grateful to Body Buddy for making this excellent product, a must-have sanity-saver for me.</li>
    <li> This works great for distributing lotion on my back evenly.  The material the applicator is made of makes it easy for me to hand wash and air dry.</li>
    <li> Works very well! As others mentioned, the strap handles are useless since they stretch, so I just hold the edges. It applies my moisturizer so well, but brrrr, it&#x27;s cold when it first hits my back :)  So long, itchy middle back!</li>
    <li> Gets stuck on your back when your doing a side to side motion to try and rub product in and does a terrible job of rubbing anything on your skin.  I threw mine away.</li>
    <li> Finally - lotion the spot between the shoulder blades that is typically unreachable by oneself!</li>
    <li> I purchased with the intention of only using this for my self tanning products. I think this works great for it. It helps apply really easy and smooth and gives a fairly even coverage. My only  gripe with the product is that the handles stretch  out fairly easy  and I am a fairly skinny person so I don&#x27;t need the extra length to use this. I fold the edges in and hold onto the material instead of the handles.</li>
    <li> Design Flaws.&lt;br /&gt;The handles that you are suppose to pull the applicator with are made of elastic, so when you are actually pulling it, the elastic expands but the application stays at the same position , the handle should have been made with a simple hard materiel which would have given the application more rigid support to move it around!&lt;br /&gt;I only bought this one as Kremas was unavailable , honestly I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The item is thinner so , it doesn&#x27;t cover much of your back in one go, and then on top of that the foolish design flaws of using a elastic as a materiel for the handle of a item which you need to move against a rough surface where fictional force is high , i find pretty stupid!</li>
    <li> strip of cold plastic I was not expecting .  Another lesson, life is great keep on living.  I would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I had one for years and my niece found one on amazon so gad to hav it</li>
    <li> so different and practical - distributed cream and lotion with ease and easy to maintain and clean up afterwards and store.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful bath aid to apply lotion to those harder to reach areas.  So glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> This actually works! I was a skeptic but it smoothly applies lotion or tanner evenly. As others have said, you may have to hold it more closely and ignore the handles. But it works well.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product!  I&#x27;m a fairly recent widow and was troubled on how to put lotion on my back...this is the answer!  Love that I can easily maneuver the lotion to all those hard to read areas.  What I love the most is that I can clean the surface easily after application.  Unlike other products that do the same thing, the lotion does not seep into the product itself.  I am so glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> Well-made and gets to all those hard-to-reach places.</li>
    <li> This works so great for quickly applying lotion on your back.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Wish I had it a long time ago.</li>
    <li> The lotion applicator does get the lotion/cream to places I cannot reach, as shown in advertised photo. However, in my opinion it is a flimsy overpriced product. I usually don&#x27;t  complain about product price because nobody forced me to buy it but really this is like a long piece of vinyl with elastic handles. In addition, once you apply the lotion you still cannot massage it into your skin, so you have to stand there naked until lotion soaks into skin on its own or else you will have lotion all over your clothing or furniture. At the end of the day, I am glad I have it because it does get the lotion/cream in places I cannot reach.</li>
    <li> The back buddy works okay.  the problem I have is the material it is made is too soft . It tends to double over on itself unless I hold it very carefully.  Otherwise it does the do what it is supposed to..... get lotion on my back where  I can&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> Makes it easy to put lotion on my back</li>
    <li> Works great to apply lotion to those &amp;#34;can&#x27;t reach&amp;#34; spots.</li>
    <li> This thing is a disaster and definitely not worth the $. The stretchy elastic handles are bad enough and make it harder just to move it around on your back. But the worst quality and the reason for my 1 star rating is that the vinyl surface (both sides) doesn&#x27;t move and spread the lotion around on your back. Finally, in frustration, I spread the lotion all over the vinyl applicator--and still the vinyl refuses to spread it beyond where it&#x27;s first applied. Worthless!</li>
    <li> Amazingly simple design, and very effective.  My wife loves it and uses it every day.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Does the job.  Not as easy to use as portrayed in product description.</li>
    <li> Does it work? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Could it be improved? Yes&lt;br /&gt;Would you buy it again? For $10 yes, but not at the price I paid (which was 2x as much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is feels like a length of pleather (fake leather) attached by two stretchy ends (handles) to pull on. I dislike the stretchy handles, when they break one day I&#x27;ll hand sew on cloth handles. The stretchy ends give too much flexibility, the applicator twists on my back and/or is harder to drag across when you have any lotion on it. I believe if the handles were cloth with no real give that the lotion would be easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This applicator does apply lotion when I can get it in the right angles. I lotion my back daily now since I have a helping &#x27;hand,&#x27; my husband used to do it but now that we have opposite schedules I can get out of the shower and not feel dry soon after. Also I managed to get myself a 2nd degree burn last year trying to garden for the first time, this baby would have really helped out re-applying lotion every 30-60 minutes!</li>
    <li> Wasnt really what I expected. Just a piece of plastic with a hoop on each end and not very well made. Wouldnt buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use a very heavy cream so this works great. I don&#x27;t clean it every time since I use it when I get out of a hot bath.  It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t absorb the cream but grabs it.  Then rub it into you back and shoulders to your hearts content!</li>
    <li> It fully met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I was having some itching on my back where I couldn&#x27;t reach with lotion.  I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  I have had no itching since using it.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and easy to clean after each use.  I would highly recommend.</li>
