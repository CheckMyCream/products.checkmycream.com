### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Quite frankly, I have never seen her this happy over hair products before!</li>
      <li>Great hair treatment!</li>
      <li>Not the best Tresemme product I&#x27;ve tried but its suppose to replace the TRESemme Flawless Curls Hydration Lotion which has been discontinued.</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>
      <li>Defintely not as good as Flawless Curls Hydration Lotion but works as described.</li>
      <li>Smells great.</li>
      <li>Hair feels great.</li>
      <li>It smooths some fly aways but not all of them.</li>
      <li>If she loves it, you know it is great.</li>
      <li>The TRESemme Infusing Serum I&#x27;ve been using for months works great for this.</li>
      <li>Love this hair cream works great on the frizz!!!</li>
      <li>This makes my hair feel so nice!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is pleasant but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>This would probably be best for someone with fine hair.</li>
      <li>For me I have not found this product be very effective when I have used it (although I love the idea!)  </li>
      <li>No matter how good a product may be, if it has a fragrance I don&#x27;t like then I won&#x27;t keep using it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This also smells really good.  </li>
      <li>Tresemme makes some great products and she was thrilled when she straigtens her hair, but she doesn&#x27;t do that often.</li>
      <li>Good product, adds shine&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>But once I get the right mixture, it works perfectly and keeps my frizz under control.</li>
      <li>You are guaranteed to love it!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>very good best hair creme ever for my dry breaking hair</li>
      <li>After trying out a bottle of the TRESemme Keratin Smooth, Infusing Smoothing Serum some months ago, I found it worked great for taming my hair.</li>
      <li>She is thrilled, she loves it.</li>
      <li>I actually really liked this product.</li>
      <li>serum is lightweight, yet effective.</li>
      <li>It controlled the frizzies and gave my hair a nice shine.</li>
      <li>It works into hair nicely and gives it a more polished look.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that tends to have fly away ends (mainly from breakage).  </li>
      <li>It lasts most of the day though, not 48 hours as the bottle claims.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m reluctant to buy retail store hair and cosmetic products, but I&#x27;m glad I tried this.  </li>
      <li>This works better than most smoothing products I have tried on my aging, dyed hair.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite hair products</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was able to feel this product on my hair</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll find you get much better smoothing results.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Tresemme products are usually top notch</li>
      <li>and i love that this product makes her hair more manageable.</li>
      <li>It works on many levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love how hair looks and feel but ,</li>
      <li>My wife is now hooked and is looking for more Tresemme products that will compliment what she already has.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite thing to use</li>
      <li>Her hair looks and feels fuller and more put together, if that makes sense.</li>
      <li>This is an okay product.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length hair that is in healthy condition</li>
      <li>Trying the smooth smoothing creme serum by tresemme was another home run!</li>
      <li>It makes the bottom portion (most damaged part) look smoothe and tamed</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant fragrance, smoothes dry fly aways and makes hair shine.  </li>
      <li>Lovely and light, helps with static.</li>
      <li>After trying this on my waist length, very straight, very fine hair- I was pretty happy with how it smoothed my hair and gave it a bit of shine.</li>
      <li>I love using this with the TRESemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatment.  </li>
      <li>Generally, it is not horribly offensive, just too sweet for my taste - better suited for a children&#x27;s product.</li>
      <li>Smells great and makes my hair feel amazing when I blow dry it.</li>
      <li>while I can say that it looks and feels great, I can also pass along that my wife, who is much more critical (of herself) thinks so, too.</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny and easy to comb after using this.</li>
      <li>Tresemme puts out some fine hair products and this one is no exception.  </li>
      <li>The scent is light and not annoying.</li>
      <li>My hair is definitely smooth after using this Tresemme Keratin Creme.</li>
      <li>but if it&#x27;s effective I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
      <li>Clean and very fresh.</li>
      <li>My vote is to skip this tiny tube of stringiness ... and buy the generously sized, amazingly effective Suave product!</li>
      <li>So, although clean, it can look unwashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In her case, pomades seem to do a bit better if she wants smooth</li>
      <li>So I have to make sure to put on evenly and not too much</li>
      <li>It did make my hair feel nice and soft as well.</li>
      <li>and It works okay in smoothing frizz, but I really don&#x27;t like the scent</li>
      <li>I did not care for this smoothing creme serum as it left my hair feeling greasy and like it needed a good wash almost immediately after using it.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, the fragrance dissipated within fifteen minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Tresemme Keratin Smooth Creme is easy to apply, brushes through well, and makes hair silky soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>It seemed to control some flyaway issues, but it really didn&#x27;t smooth her hair as well as it did mine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t great, but it also doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy scent to compete with colognes.</li>
      <li>Fragrance is an effective way to brand a product, and whether the scent is a problem will depend upon the individual user.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had success with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>The smell is not what I&#x27;d expect, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal, and I more care about how light the serum is.</li>
      <li>For smoothing down frizz, this serum is pleasantly lightweight.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products to control the frizz</li>
      <li>B00GTC02LA Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle Light</li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels soft and smooth and stays that way all day.</li>
      <li>This product does exactly as it says.</li>
      <li>The first time i used it i put it throughout all my hair which was a</li>
      <li>I used this product exactly as directed.</li>
      <li>the next 5 days I will use about about a thimble of creme, rub into my palms and smooth over my hair, after combing or brushing, and it looks salon fresh again.</li>
      <li>I tried upping the amount I used, but that simply made my hair greasy without increasing the smoothness - although more product does make the hair look much shinier.  </li>
      <li>When we first started using it, I think we used too much</li>
      <li>Like many other hair products, I found that the recommended amount is too much, so I used much less on my hair with good results.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference with my hair and this is an easy to use fix for all your frizz difficulties.</li>
      <li>I thought the scent was fine, at least, and the general consistency of the product was good.  </li>
      <li>I have to flat iron it just to get it to a normal, more style-able and manageable state.</li>
      <li>But, it did have a nice, light scent, and can be used on hair wet or dry.</li>
      <li>and we put too much on our hair close to the scalp and that was a mistake.  </li>
      <li>Also, I am not a fan of the very girly fragrance</li>
      <li>and I can definitely say that I really enjoy this one.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;why is that price is to much when on the stores are $4.89??????</li>
      <li>You would have to use really a lot to get them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It lasted two days as advertised, which wasn&#x27;t exaggerating as much as somme of their products.</li>
      <li>The fragrance does keep me from using it as much as I would like to.</li>
      <li>but if I use too much, it does get a greasy look fast.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair products from expensive to cheap and for a cheap line of products, I am in love with this Keratin line.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of my favorite hair products</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel so nice! Love this product!</li>
    <li> Smooths my frizzy messy curls.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as it says. My hair is shiny and easy to comb after using this. My daughter has crazy thick hair and i love that this product makes her hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> This works well but if I use too much, it does get a greasy look fast.  So I have to make sure to put on evenly and not too much or I have to wash it out and start over. But once I get the right mixture, it works perfectly and keeps my frizz under control.</li>
    <li> I did not care for this smoothing creme serum as it left my hair feeling greasy and like it needed a good wash almost immediately after using it.  Though it is  more expensive I much prefer Tony and Guy leave in conditioner to this Keratin product as that product leaves my hair feeling clean, controlled  and in condition.</li>
    <li> For me I have not found this product be very effective when I have used it (although I love the idea!)  As a disclaimer, I do have extremely thick, generally unruly hair so perhaps it just had an insurmountable hill for the product to have to climb.  I thought the scent was fine, at least, and the general consistency of the product was good.  I liked that the directions said it could be used with either dry or wet hair, because it gives you choices within your hair care regimen.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, controls frizz and fly-aways without weighing hair down for shiny, satin-smooth hair. I go to the hair salon once a week for a wash and blowout. the next 5 days I will use about about a thimble of creme, rub into my palms and smooth over my hair, after combing or brushing, and it looks salon fresh again.</li>
    <li> Love this hair cream works great on the frizz!!!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, and it&#x27;s beginning to thin a bit as I pass into my middle years.  A few weeks ago I had my hair colored, and the hairdresser left the chemical on my hair a bit too long, resulting in my hair being dry and brittle now.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different products to try and make the damaged hair look better, until it grows out enough to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions on the tube, only using a small amount because of my hair type.  It made my hair look limp and a bit greasy.  Unfortunately, with my hair type, many hair products just don&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that tends to have fly away ends (mainly from breakage).  This product keeps my hair looking smooth without weighing it down.  The scent is light and not annoying.</li>
    <li> I love using this with the TRESemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatment.  It makes the bottom portion (most damaged part) look smoothe and tamed and I always regret it I don&#x27;t put it on my damp hair after showering.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair products from expensive to cheap and for a cheap line of products, I am in love with this Keratin line.</li>
    <li> This is a decent hair smoothing serum. It works into hair nicely and gives it a more polished look. It smooths some fly aways but not all of them. You would have to use really a lot to get them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is this is advertised as a keratin smoothing creme. If you are looking for a real keratin type of result you will be disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t give anywhere near that level of smoothing or straightening. I didn&#x27;t get that keratin level of gloss either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fine serum, not a great keratin product.</li>
    <li> When we first started using it, I think we used too much and we put too much on our hair close to the scalp and that was a mistake.  It made our hair look a bit greasy and flat.  Using less and only putting it on the stands of the hair makes our hair look and feel so smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also smells really good.  Clean and very fresh.</li>
    <li> I used this product exactly as directed. Now, the thickness of the creme made it a little difficult to quickly and evenly distribute through hair. Ultimately, I cannot say that the results were optimal. For me, my hair appeared a little stringy/greasy ... and I used very little of the product. While my \\&quot;fly-aways\\&quot; were tamed, my hair immediately appeared as though it needed to be washed (again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I have been spoiled by the new [[ASIN:B00GTC02LA Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle Light Leave-in Cream]]. That \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; is a miracle in a bottle! My vote is to skip this tiny tube of stringiness ... and buy the generously sized, amazingly effective Suave product! You are guaranteed to love it!</li>
    <li> No matter how good a product may be, if it has a fragrance I don&#x27;t like then I won&#x27;t keep using it. This is one of those products. I used it once and It works okay in smoothing frizz, but I really don&#x27;t like the scent so I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> Great hair treatment!</li>
    <li> My hair is definitely smooth after using this Tresemme Keratin Creme. I am pleasantly surprised. I am no expert in smoothing products - I pretty much try whatever I see in commercials or what&#x27;s on sale - but this is one that I&#x27;ll keep coming back to. The smell is not what I&#x27;d expect, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal, and I more care about how light the serum is. I&#x27;ll be recommending the Keratin line!</li>
    <li> I have thick 4A hair, and the Tresemme Keratin Smooth didn&#x27;t tame my hair, and made it feel a little hard/sticky. But, it did have a nice, light scent, and can be used on hair wet or dry.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product. I have really frizzy, dry, damaged hair. This helps to calm down the frizziness, but I don&#x27;t wash my hair on a daily basis so this can build up if you use too much or use it too frequently, but that&#x27;s the case with most hair products of this nature. It did make my hair feel nice and soft as well.</li>
    <li> I actually really liked this product. It lasted two days as advertised, which wasn&#x27;t exaggerating as much as somme of their products. My hair was smoothed down and kept frizz free over the two day period and there was that little extra shine to it the weight of a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Not the best Tresemme product I&#x27;ve tried but its suppose to replace the TRESemme Flawless Curls Hydration Lotion which has been discontinued. Defintely not as good as Flawless Curls Hydration Lotion but works as described.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair that experiences frizz due to chlorine damage. I&#x27;ve tried many different products to control the frizz and I can definitely say that I really enjoy this one. It works on many levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant but not overpowering. You only need to use a bit of the serum to achieve frizz control, assuming the area is not too large. That gives you a ton of value for this container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme products are usually top notch and this is one you&#x27;ll want to try if you&#x27;re experiencing frizz problems. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference with my hair and this is an easy to use fix for all your frizz difficulties.</li>
    <li> For smoothing down frizz, this serum is pleasantly lightweight.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or over-saturated with product, as some other smoothing cremes have done.  Unfortunately, sometimes serums have to be heavier to be effective.  The smoothing effect is extremely temporary - after an hour or two, my hair looks more or less as it did before application.  I tried upping the amount I used, but that simply made my hair greasy without increasing the smoothness - although more product does make the hair look much shinier.  Overall, it was a decent product but not a knock-it-out-of-the-park success.</li>
    <li> Hair still felt dry after using this. I bought it hoping it would moisturize the ends of my hair without weighing it down too much like the argan oil I&#x27;ve been using. It didn&#x27;t weigh it down, but it didn&#x27;t have any positive effect either.</li>
    <li> Have used in the past and was unable to find in stores locally so was happy to see at Amazon. Good product, adds shine&lt;br /&gt;And manageability to hair.</li>
    <li> After trying this on my waist length, very straight, very fine hair- I was pretty happy with how it smoothed my hair and gave it a bit of shine. It didn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or stringy which is always a hazard with serums and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was less effective on my daughter&#x27;s short, curly hair. It seemed to control some flyaway issues, but it really didn&#x27;t smooth her hair as well as it did mine. In her case, pomades seem to do a bit better if she wants smooth hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t great, but it also doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy scent to compete with colognes.</li>
    <li> Tresemme Keratin Smooth Creme is easy to apply, brushes through well, and makes hair silky soft and manageable.  Like many other hair products, I found that the recommended amount is too much, so I used much less on my hair with good results.  It brushes through easily and when dried made my hair shiny, but not overly so.  I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the scent, but it&#x27;s subtle and dissipates after some time.  Overall, this is a solid hair smoothing creme and works well.  I can see this going into my hair care rotation.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and have never had very good luck with these kinds of products because I have to put an awful lot of product in my hair before it begins to control any frizz or provide any shine.  Some products actually bring back the horrors of seventh grade by making my hair frizzy all over.  Most are not that bad but by the time I get enough in, it begins to weigh down my hair, which makes it straight – and I hate that.  This Tresemme product went on fine and seemed to control frizz and even to be a little shiny without weighing down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to feel this product on my hair but it wasn’t stiff or sticky, just kind of shiny.  The only thing I really disliked is that it left a slimy, not shiny, feel on my hands.</li>
    <li> Lovely and light, helps with static.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reluctant to buy retail store hair and cosmetic products, but I&#x27;m glad I tried this.  A little goes a long way and you can either rub this into wet hair and air dry, use it to blow dry, or even use as a smoother, relaxer on dry hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my hair feel amazing when I blow dry it.</li>
    <li> I used this creme on the ends of my hair and it left it feeling very soft. It definitely didn&#x27;t get frizzy, and I felt confident letting my hair down at work. However, if I use it every day, it builds up and becomes heavy. I found that I can only use it about once per week, and I treat it like a special treatment when I use it. I don&#x27;t care for the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t linger. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a useful product, but should just be used occasionally.</li>
    <li> Tresemme puts out some fine hair products and this one is no exception.  It has a pleasant fragrance, smoothes dry fly aways and makes hair shine.  It&#x27;s not greasy, but you have to be careful to not use too much.  I never used to use hair telegraphed than shampoo and conditioner, but I&#x27;m hooked on this one!</li>
    <li> I hate to say this - because it&#x27;s so nicely packaged, but it didn&#x27;t do it for me.  I prefer Moroccan oil, and this stuff was kind of thick.  And it didn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny.  I guess for me, putting something that felt like a thick cream on my hair - well, I just expected more - however I have VERY thick hair - maybe that&#x27;s why I prefer a lighter oil.  I know I&#x27;m in the minority here - but I have to be truthful and give a thumbs down.</li>
    <li> My wife complains about her hair frizzing all the time. Tresemme makes some great products and she was thrilled when she straigtens her hair, but she doesn&#x27;t do that often. Trying the smooth smoothing creme serum by tresemme was another home run! She is thrilled, she loves it. Her hair looks and feels fuller and more put together, if that makes sense. My wife is now hooked and is looking for more Tresemme products that will compliment what she already has. Quite frankly, I have never seen her this happy over hair products before! while I can say that it looks and feels great, I can also pass along that my wife, who is much more critical (of herself) thinks so, too. If she loves it, you know it is great. She says 5 stars....easy.</li>
    <li> After rubbing a pea-sized amount of the smoothing creme serum between my palms, I used my fingers to distribute the product on the frizzy parts of my freshly washed and dried hair. My hair is long with a thin slightly curly texture. Parts of it tend to frizz but because of the texture, products like this sometimes weigh it down. So, although clean, it can look unwashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a constant frustration - the need for the product to tame the frizz, accompanied by inevitable, unpleasant after-effects. Not the case with this smoothing serum. Granted I used it sparingly, but where I applied it, my hair looked shiny, and the serum added no weight to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that I do not care for the fragrance, which reminds me of the way strawberry licorice smells. Fragrance is an effective way to brand a product, and whether the scent is a problem will depend upon the individual user. Generally, it is not horribly offensive, just too sweet for my taste - better suited for a children&#x27;s product. Unscented would be an improvement. Luckily, the fragrance dissipated within fifteen minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is lightweight, yet effective. It controlled the frizzies and gave my hair a nice shine. If only it did not smell like fruity candy.</li>
    <li> This works better than most smoothing products I have tried on my aging, dyed hair.  It lasts most of the day though, not 48 hours as the bottle claims.  Also, I am not a fan of the very girly fragrance but I do get used to it after an hour or so.  The fragrance does keep me from using it as much as I would like to.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair that is in healthy condition but since I&#x27;ve gotten older (39) and had children (2), my hair has become slightly frizzy. I apply a quarter size amount to my towel dried hair and blow dry. My hair looks and feels soft and smooth and stays that way all day. I&#x27;ve had success with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> After trying out a bottle of the TRESemme Keratin Smooth, Infusing Smoothing Serum some months ago, I found it worked great for taming my hair. My hair is quite long, thick and has been bleached blonde, from a very dark brown. So when I blow dry it, I end up with a huge poof of hair. I have to flat iron it just to get it to a normal, more style-able and manageable state. I also use different products on it while it&#x27;s still wet to help protect it from the heat and bring down some of the volume and smooth it out. The TRESemme Infusing Serum I&#x27;ve been using for months works great for this. I assumed I would get similar results from this product as well. Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the Infusing Serum version of this hair product, this is a cream and doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all for my hair. It&#x27;s almost like I&#x27;m not even using any smoothing product at all. I think this product may work better for someone who&#x27;s looking for some subtle smoothing while trying to keep the maximum amount of volume with their hair as well. This would probably be best for someone with fine hair. But if you have thick hair that needs tamed, you&#x27;ll probably see very little results from this. I&#x27;d suggest the Tresemme&#x27;s Infusing Serum version instead. You&#x27;ll find you get much better smoothing results.</li>
    <li> I used this to control frizz and problem areas that like to pop up. It works decently. It&#x27;s not my favorite thing to use but if it&#x27;s effective I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> Love how hair looks and feel but ,&lt;br /&gt;why is that price is to much when on the stores are $4.89??????</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> very good best hair creme ever for my dry breaking hair</li>
    <li> I love this product. The first time i used it i put it throughout all my hair which was a no no. Only use on the ends because your roots will look greasy. When i used this correctly no complaints. Hair feels great. Smells great. Definitely recommend</li>
