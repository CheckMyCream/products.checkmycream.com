      <li>now i feel better and even look younger.</li>
      <li>My wife first purchased this item for a skin problem she was having.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I finally found a product that works for me.</li>
      <li>but my skin does look better and I have not been breaking out at all since starting to use it.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product and it seems very high quality.</li>
      <li>After seeing such great results on my scars, I started using it on my acne and literally after just a few days, the redness and spots had diminished to almost nothing.</li>
      <li>It really helped me with my skin problems</li>
      <li>This has helped my skin so much in fading scars.</li>
      <li>and I cant believe that this really worked.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t much care for the smell &#x27;coz</li>
      <li>This oil worked way better than I expected.</li>
      <li>Absorbs fast.</li>
      <li>My skin feels very moisturized.</li>
      <li>My skin on my face was dry and red and improve nicely.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this brand.</li>
      <li>I have been using it on my face for about 2 weeks and it has cleared my skin of nearly all pimples and black heads making my skin clearer and giving me more confidence.</li>
      <li>All I know is this: if it doesnt smell like it should, send it back right away.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have something that will work pretty much no matter what is wrong with your skin.</li>
      <li>That was in no way similar to what my first bottle smelled like that I had purchased from another company.</li>
      <li>It clear up all my face.</li>
      <li>Just a warning to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks now and my eczema has almost completely cleared up.</li>
      <li>I have been using for one month and have noticed marked improvement.</li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to smells this might not be the product for you.  </li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive</li>

      <li>I have been trying all kinds of different oils on my face to both prevent both breakouts and dry skin (lucky me, I have both.)</li>
      <li>Coconut oil makes me break out horribly, Shea butter is great but doesn&#x27;t always moisturize enough, hemp oil doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts but needs to be refrigerated and doesn&#x27;t moisturize my face enough, and most other oils available cause breakouts in my skin.</li>
      <li>The price is a little more than some other oils</li>
      <li>I am healing from some chin breakouts and they are really healing up fast, I&#x27;ve been using this oil day and night and putting a little bit extra on my healing blemishes.</li>
      <li>I wouldn’t even have learnt that such a miraculous natural product existed.</li>
      <li>I think this was due to spending too much time in a bikini when I was younger.</li>
      <li>, it’s quicker working and no strange irritations on my skin.</li>
      <li>It absorbs fairly quickly for how thick it is</li>

<li> I used this for 2 months healing a granulating wound after it closed.  </li>
<li> ALL C SKIN EVERYTINHG FOR ALL CONDITIONS, ALLEGEDLY</li>
<li> For anyone who has never used this oil, it is a thicker oil that when cold will get harder, it also has a nutty, sweet syrup type smell.</li>
<li> Tried other wart removers including freezing them, but this stuff seems to be dissolving them.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, but it takes time to see actual results.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I tried using this product to help with acne and some scarring, and I had a nasty reaction to it. Now I&#x27;m seeing a dermatologist to correct the problem and my skin is the worst it&#x27;s been in my life, even two months after stopping use. My face is full of clogged pores, and the derm said to NEVER use ANY kind of oil on your face if you&#x27;re acne prone! I decided to try using it on my dry hands, and it cause them to break out in little bumps! PLEASE consult a doctor before you try this! I&#x27;m very disappointed, I wanted it to work so badly!</li>
    <li> I have been trying all kinds of different oils on my face to both prevent both breakouts and dry skin (lucky me, I have both.) So far this oil works better for me than any oil I&#x27;ve tried. Coconut oil makes me break out horribly, Shea butter is great but doesn&#x27;t always moisturize enough, hemp oil doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts but needs to be refrigerated and doesn&#x27;t moisturize my face enough, and most other oils available cause breakouts in my skin. This oil has a very strong smell compared to others (very earthy, it reminds me of wet wood) and is thick so it takes a bit of effort to rub it in. But the results are worth it! I am healing from some chin breakouts and they are really healing up fast, I&#x27;ve been using this oil day and night and putting a little bit extra on my healing blemishes. I am very impressed. My skin feels very moisturized. I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed that this oil is the answer I&#x27;ve been looking for, so far I&#x27;m really loving it. The price is a little more than some other oils but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I have bought tamanu oil in the past and it worked great but I ran out. I bought from this company because it had the squirt lid. When I first got it i noticed that the oil smelled kind of off; like a Christmas ham. Seriously. That was in no way similar to what my first bottle smelled like that I had purchased from another company. I proceeded to use it because I figured it might be due to different processing techniques. However, after about a week I started to develop what looked like eczema all over my face. It is winter so i figured it was just due to dry weather, but after a month it got so bad that I decided to quit using it. It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks now and my eczema has almost completely cleared up. I dont know if I just got a bad bottle or if all their oil is like this. All I know is this: if it doesnt smell like it should, send it back right away. I wont be purchasing from this company again in the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> This is great for every skin condition I&#x27;ve tried it for so far. I originally got it to use on eczema, but it also works wonders on acne and even rashes. It&#x27;s nice to have something that will work pretty much no matter what is wrong with your skin. The price is affordable and it comes in a cute bottle with a squirt lid. It does not smell bad or feel bad on the skin, so I have absolutely no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for toe nail fungus.  Applied it three nights in a row and fungus was gone.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, who has severe acne problems and his skin has improved a lot!</li>
    <li> ALL C SKIN EVERYTINHG FOR ALL CONDITIONS, ALLEGEDLY</li>
    <li> Mix two pumps of Tamanu Oil with about 4 drops of Ravensara Essential Oil and apply to Shingles. Also apply down spine and on bottom of feet. This is a very strong anti-viral treatment.</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my face, neck and the back of my hands daily.  Absorbs fast. Beautiful color with a wonderful nutty smell.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this Tamanu oil.</li>
    <li> My wife first purchased this item for a skin problem she was having. A few months later I developed rosacea and was having difficulty finding any product that I could use on my face that didn&#x27;t hurt and sting. My wife did a bit of research for me and encouraged me to try tamanu oil.  I was convinced to give it a try. It has brought remarkable healing and comfort to my face. I now use it every night after I cleanse my face to sooth and heal my skin overnight. It helps reduce the redness and keeps my face from getting the sandpaper texture I was dealing with.</li>
    <li> I am the greatest fan of Tamanu Oil. Having reached the age of 50, I found that I was beginning to have some age spots appear on the back of my hands. I think this was due to spending too much time in a bikini when I was younger. Whatever the reason, I didn’t like it. After using Tamanu Oil, I don’t have one single age spot on either hand! I now use this oil all the time. It is the greatest skin care secret of all time. I wouldn’t even have learnt that such a miraculous natural product existed.</li>
    <li> This Cold pressed Tamanu oil is very helpful on my face. I suffered from acne for about 5 months. I used different products as recommended by friends and family. But no good result.No improvement.But when I started using it I was amazed how it works. It clear up all my face. Acne start drying and gone in few days. Highly recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> I suffered the worse breakout that I&#x27;ve had in the past 3 months. I decided to give this oil a try (not greasy and great for acne prone skin). I really enjoyed this oil because it was light enough to use by itself during the day. My skin has improved a lot! I am still recovering from scars due to those nasty breakouts, but I can definitely see that they have faded a bit and my complexion is brighter. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I did a ton of research on this product and knew that it would be a cloudy color with a nutty smell.  I found both of those to be true.  I know that these are the sign of a good product when it comes to a Tamanu oil but the smell lasts a bit longer than I thought.  My boyfriend has noticed it a few times.  If you are sensitive to smells this might not be the product for you.  As far as texture and feel, I would say that this is a thicker oil that goes on the skin nicely.  A small amount goes a LONG way.  It absorbs fairly quickly for how thick it is and I am happy with it.  I have been using this with another oil so I can&#x27;t say for sure this is doing what it says it does but my skin does look better and I have not been breaking out at all since starting to use it.  I had really dry skin after the dry winter we had and this has helped a lot!  It will take me a while to go through this but I would consider re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> This has helped my skin so much in fading scars. I also made a serum out of this to help with scars on my son&#x27;s leg from a dog bite attack, and they are fading too. I will be ordering again for its cheap price!</li>
    <li> I love oils because there so natural but this tamanu oil is one of my favorite oils because it gives me all the essentials for my whole body from hair to skin. I have been using oils for a year so far and my hair and skin all over my body has been just perfect. I can feel the difference in my body, just a really good product for anyone.</li>
    <li> I started using Tamanu Oil two months ago, at first on my scars and saw that they were fading away, I applied it three times a day and within 1 month they had faded in color and were much smaller in size, after another month they had decreased to almost nothing. After seeing such great results on my scars, I started using it on my acne and literally after just a few days, the redness and spots had diminished to almost nothing. I have been using it on my face for about 2 weeks and it has cleared my skin of nearly all pimples and black heads making my skin clearer and giving me more confidence.</li>
    <li> I had some problems with my hair before but since i started using this product they are all gone.</li>
    <li> Great oil, I use it for my face and it has cleared my acne up and really helped with scarring as well. I would recommend using this.</li>
    <li> This oil worked way better than I expected. I have only been using this for a short time and I have to say that I am impressed with the results. I had my doubts when I bought it but I heard about Tamanu and decided to give it a try.My skin is starting to look better than it has in months. I had a very bad acne breakout recently and have been trying anything to get rid of the bumps. My skin is sensitive so most things I have tried has only made the situation worst. I am glad that I finally found a product that works for me. I have been looking for months and I cant believe that this really worked.  It really works great and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t much care for the smell &#x27;coz this is amazing and I finally think I&#x27;ve found an oil that will help my nail fungus. I just reordered and will start my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I am not sure about this product. I&#x27;ve used different brand and was thicker and no mildew odor. This one is more runny and smell is really funky.</li>
    <li> Tamanu oil helped my son alot. It has relieved pain caused by shingles flare-ups. As even vaccines never helped him in any way to reduce the infection.  It also helped to heal and soothe irritations and sores. It is one right product for shingle sufferers like him. It amazingly worked beyond our expectation!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this to get rid of my skin allergies. I applied these few drops(Concentrated with thick consistency) daily to my affected skin areas. It spreads easily and absorbs quickly. I have been using for one month and have noticed marked improvement. I am happy with this oil.</li>
    <li> It does wonders on my skin, right from healing my redness and spots and many more to list. My family is using it for it is Cold pressed and natural. Hope to find many more good from it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been researching various oils for my face and finally decided to try tamanu. Great oil, I use it for my face and it has cleared my acne up and really helped with scarring as well. I can&#x27;t wait to continue using this product!!</li>
    <li> I works but very slowly and gently. Also, I noticed when used around the mouth made the corners of the lips dry and red and irritated, I stopped using it and went back to vitamin C treatment, it’s quicker working and no strange irritations on my skin.</li>
    <li> Just a warning to anyone with sensitive skin.  I used this for 2 months healing a granulating wound after it closed.  I had no problems at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, 3 months later in the same spot I had 6 stitches holding closed a mohs surgical site.  2 weeks later the stitches came out and I started using the oil to help heal the incision site.  2 days later I had a SEVERE allergic reaction which split my suture line!!!!  Now I will have to deal with a wider scar than if the site had healed perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has had poison ivy- this is the kind of allergic dermatitis I had.  Hard ,swollen, blistered red skin that split my suture line.</li>
    <li> Use this on some plantar warts and age spots.  So far it seems to be working on the warts.  Tried other wart removers including freezing them, but this stuff seems to be dissolving them.  It is also lightening the pigmentation of the age spots.  There is an unusual odor to the oil, but it is not unpleasant.  Therefore, I only use it on the age spots before going to bed.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever bought. Does great wonder on my skin. I use it at least twice a day.</li>
    <li> It does an excellent job in reducing my lines and blemishes.</li>
    <li> It really helped me with my skin problems now i feel better and even look younger.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and it seems very high quality. I have bought Tamanu oil before from another company and there was nothing wrong with this companies oil but bottle it was in. This comes in a glass bottle with a pump. Very easy to use and the company backs up there product which is very nice. This oils is not only great for healing your skin, it is also anti-inflammatory and can help with certain types of pain. For anyone who has never used this oil, it is a thicker oil that when cold will get harder, it also has a nutty, sweet syrup type smell. I use it for my face and hands mostly. I find that my skin is improving, I had very dry skin, with cracks and cuts on my skin, next to my nails. My skin on my face was dry and red and improve nicely. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
