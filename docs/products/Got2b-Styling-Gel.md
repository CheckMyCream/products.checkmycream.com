      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this this product!</li>
      <li>The things I like best about this product are that it shortens the blow dry time and it smells very nice.  </li>

      <li>I thought it was ok, not bad or great</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff and they stopped styling it in stores.</li>
      <li>Fortunate to be able to buy it online as no longer am able to purchase in the drugstores.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that is cut in a bob.</li>
      <li>I suppose if volume is more important than shine then this is definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>It looks and feels fabulous, maybe even better than yesterday when I first blew it out.</li>
      <li>Best of all, this stuff really accelerates dry time.</li>
      <li>a great product that is getting harder to find.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair full with lots of shine and smoothness.</li>
      <li>I got lucky-</li>
      <li>My 74 year old mother called me &amp; asked if I knew of anywhere she could purchase her favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>Works as expected good value</li>
      <li>This stuff is great if you need a little lift!  </li>
      <li>I got one, and after using it, went back and got two more before they ran out.</li>
      <li>Once my hair is blown dried, I have bouncy hair that stays in place better and is a bit fuller plus looks smooth and finished.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on second day hair right now, and it&#x27;s still super silky and shiny...</li>
      <li>Made my hair very shiny and manageable.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t need much help there.</li>
      <li>I really like how this makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>My only criticism is the strong scent when you first put it on, but honestly I like the scent a lot, and it&#x27;s a lot more subtle once your hair is dry.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s quite fine and can look flat.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s also a good value.</li>
      <li>It does knock down static in my hair and fluffs it up a tiny bit.  </li>
      <li>I quickly got on Amazon, found her product &amp; sent her enough to last 6 to 8 months.</li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>I have wasted so much money on high end hair products that never give me the results I want.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t exactly give me crazy volume, but my hair looked full and VERY shiny after blow-drying.</li>
      <li>delivery was fast and as expected.</li>
      <li>For my short, fine hair I&#x27;ve learned to use a TINY amount, petite pea size or less, to avoid it weighing down my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s a creme, but not a thick, heavy creme.  It really does add volume to my short, thin hair.  I definitely see a difference in my hair when I use this product.  A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s also a good value.</li>
    <li> I really like how this makes my hair feel. I only wish I would have found it long ago.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel stiff and dull.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  I have fine, dry shoulder length hair with a slight curl and wanted a leave in to give my hair a little volume and smoothness without it being greasy or weighing my hair down.  This works perfectly.  I use a bead about the size of a pea on the roots of my towel-dried hair and comb it though to the ends.  Once my hair is blown dried, I have bouncy hair that stays in place better and is a bit fuller plus looks smooth and finished.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if you need a little lift!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Did not love this product.</li>
    <li> The best creme I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> Works as expected good value</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  I love this this product!</li>
    <li> It does what it promises. Static/fly away control, shine, and a little extra volume. The scent is VERY strong. All you&#x27;ll need is a dime size amount, for medium hair.</li>
    <li> a great product that is getting harder to find. delivery was fast and as expected.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fortunate to be able to buy it online as no longer am able to purchase in the drugstores.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells terrible. I am not sure if it works or not because I can&#x27;t bear to have that smell so close to my nose.</li>
    <li> I have fine, rather thin blonde hair and this product makes it fluffy but also shiny. Usually you only get one or the other. I have chin length hair and it takes a dot the size of a dime, so it seems like this bottle is going to last forever. But when I do finish the bottle, I will definitely re-buy.</li>
    <li> The things I like best about this product are that it shortens the blow dry time and it smells very nice.  It does knock down static in my hair and fluffs it up a tiny bit.  For my short, fine hair I&#x27;ve learned to use a TINY amount, petite pea size or less, to avoid it weighing down my hair. I do not notice any more shine, though, so that&#x27;s a little disappointing.</li>
    <li> No more shine than any rinse; gives no body at all</li>
    <li> I was very impressed, this is a fantastic volumizer! It gives your hair a big boost from the roots and makes it bouncy with no stiffness, and no residue that impacts shine. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 was because it didn&#x27;t make my hair drastically shinier but my hair is already shiny so I don&#x27;t need much help there. I suppose if volume is more important than shine then this is definitely worth trying. The scent smells a bit like fruity baby powder if that makes any sense. I thought it was ok, not bad or great but I didn&#x27;t mind smelling it. But the volume...wow. If you&#x27;re hair is already thick this will give you Disney princess thick hair!</li>
    <li> Made my hair very shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is cut in a bob. I have wasted so much money on high end hair products that never give me the results I want. This product does give me the results I want. It makes my hair full with lots of shine and smoothness. It also provides heat protection. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My 74 year old mother called me &amp; asked if I knew of anywhere she could purchase her favorite hair product. I quickly got on Amazon, found her product &amp; sent her enough to last 6 to 8 months. She was thrilled !!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and they stopped styling it in stores. Thank god Amazon carries it! I&#x27;ll be sad when it&#x27;s gone forever.</li>
    <li> I got lucky- my local liquidation center has a bunch of these on sale for 1.99!! I got one, and after using it, went back and got two more before they ran out. I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s quite fine and can look flat. This didn&#x27;t exactly give me crazy volume, but my hair looked full and VERY shiny after blow-drying. I&#x27;m on second day hair right now, and it&#x27;s still super silky and shiny... It looks and feels fabulous, maybe even better than yesterday when I first blew it out. My only criticism is the strong scent when you first put it on, but honestly I like the scent a lot, and it&#x27;s a lot more subtle once your hair is dry. Best of all, this stuff really accelerates dry time. Usually, it takes me about 10 minutes. I would say it took me 7 yesterday, which is great.</li>
