<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought these brushes and they work great better then the ones im use to have 😊</li>
    <li> This is a good set of brushes for me!  These are just the ones I use and need but something to keep them in would have been extremely convenient…they came with a bag in which the bristles can get ruined and you can&#x27;t see them all at one time. They are soft, but not too soft so that my bronzer gets &amp;#34;muddled&amp;#34; when I am trying to get good lines for contouring.  This is the perfect set because there is every brush I need to apply face makeup and every brush I need for my eye makeup.  They come in a very convenient package, and I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m definitely ordering more. &#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> Omg ! I loveeee them ! They came in well packaged and on time ! I love how they even come with a little sheet of paper explaining what brush is for what. Love love love them ! So worth every penny :D</li>
    <li> It said I was supposed to get these brushes around December 30th. I&#x27;m so happy with them coming early! I got them around Late November. I&#x27;m beyond ecstatic about buying these. It was so worth it. They&#x27;re soft and amazing to use!</li>
    <li> absolutely love these!  good quality and makes a definite difference in my makeup appearance</li>
    <li> Very very good quality. I recommend</li>
    <li> I expect to be a little better</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! I purchested them for my girlfriend and she loves them, they are very soft build well and have a nice finish to them so you won&#x27;t get splinters. My girlfriend loved them so much she made me feel them.</li>
    <li> I AM EDITING MY REVIEW.  Several weeks ago one of the brushes I received fell apart every bristle came out of the handle at once.  I contacted the seller about it  and never received a reply. For that reason I&#x27;m downgrading my review. Customer service is something I value and cannot support a company who doesn&#x27;t value it&#x27;s customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the softest makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever used.  For the price you just can&#x27;t go wrong. They also wash very well!</li>
    <li> Easy to handle while applying makeup and fixs well in purse makeup bag</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE! The smell isn&#x27;t that bad. Super soft!</li>
    <li> My first thought when I opened this package with this product in it was, &#x27;what a lovely bag&#x27;, and it it is but I was overly impressed when I took out all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought when I opened this package with this product in it was, &#x27;what a lovely bag&#x27;, and  I was overly impressed when I took out all that was&lt;br /&gt; inside this lovely bag.  It is packed full  of very professional well made Brushes, and I&#x27;m serious about that. I&#x27;m not going to name them all off, but here are a few.  You have  Big Eye shadow Brush, Eye Smudge Brush and Mini Kabuki Brush and of course much more, each wrapped in their little bag with Bamboo handles. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;. So how do they work? The answer is excellent and I love them. The brushes so far have kept their shape even after I have cleaned them.  They feel so good as well, not brisk and hard, I hate that in a brush, but  these are perfect..They actually feel great when I use them.  I love this set, it has everything that you need and the quality is outstanding. I am very happy to recommend them to you. I think you will get a lot of use out of them and be happy with their performance. Recommended to you.  Product received for a honest review</li>
    <li> I love this set. It even comes with a little pouch for them all. Great price!</li>
    <li> All I have to say is that I was really disappointed with the quality of this product. I wish I could get my money back :/</li>
    <li> They are ok brushes but for now they will have to do. I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money for them again because they are cheap but if you need brushes now then they do work for a short time, nothing I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent  brushes for a great price. Very soft. Nicely made.</li>
    <li> The brushes are so soft and they are made sturdy and the handle feels nice,came right on time</li>
    <li> These brushes work wonders... I love using them when applying my makeup...ur face becomes all even..</li>
    <li> Good brushes come with not so good prices usually but not in this case.  The brushes are excellent!  Very Soft, they pick up product without dumping it all over the place and blend so well that I would say the compare to some higher end brushes I&#x27;ve used and tried at my local Sephora but without the extreme prices.  Tools can be very subjective but I recommend these brushes to friends who I know use everything from eco-tools to Marc Jacob.  The only thing I wish is that this set would have included a large powder dome brush which I prefer to use for blush but great looks can be achieved from this set very easily. I&#x27;ve used them with Kat Von D products along with Revlon and Maybelline. They blend really well.  Shipping was quick in my case, but as long as the quality holds out they would be worth the wait.  I would definitely purchase these again.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are great for a grab and go travel set. They come in a very nice bag, and come with a great variety of brushes. I love how soft yet, well packed the brushes are. And they have not yet shed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a good mix of face and eye brushes. I appreciate that the set didn&#x27;t come with the fan brush or the dinky little mascara apllying brush. I see those in too many &amp;#34;complete&amp;#34; kits and I think they are just throwaways. I have found myself reaching for every one of these brushes. And you can&#x27;t beat the value of the kit. Much better than the target brand brushes I had tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*disclaimer- I was given a sample of this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I was not compensated for my thoughts.</li>
    <li> great present for wife</li>
    <li> Excellent!! I love my brushes and the price is not expensive!</li>
    <li> the only complaint is that most of my brushes have broken apart because the glue, i guess, isn&#x27;t great quality.</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes!! So soft and they didnt smell at all.. I did wash them before using bc i have sensitive skin. All the bristles stay intact!!! Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! By far the best ones I&#x27;ve used and can&#x27;t forget to mention how soft the bristles are.</li>
    <li> In love with my brushes they work amazing so far! My make up looks so much better now</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the two day shipping and the presentation of packaging. When I opened the box there was a&lt;br /&gt;Orange velvet sack with a straw string which contained a nice plastic bag which held the brushes. Presentation is&lt;br /&gt;The key to a nice product. There was only one brush that shed. I rate this product three stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rather use these brushes over some of the $38+ brushes I own. Need I say more?</li>
    <li> Product arrived as expected. Fast delivery. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> Just got these today (when they were supposed to come in February) and I love them! They are so soft and great quality! The only bad thing I have to say is that the bag it came in smelled bad. It came from China though.</li>
    <li> I have been using make up brushes since a while and I honestly feel these are a great bunch of brushes at a very reasonable cost. I was pleasantly surprised by the great quality of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles are made of high quality bamboo and the bristles are of nylon and synthetic fibers. These help is very easy application of make up and blends really well. The brushes are easy to hold and very easy to apply. Cleaning them is also easy and the bristles do not fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set contains 11 brushes-&lt;br /&gt;1. Foundation Brush&lt;br /&gt;2. Big Eye shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;3. High Light Brush&lt;br /&gt;4. Eye Smudge Brush&lt;br /&gt;5. Concealer Brush&lt;br /&gt;6. Eyebrow Brush&lt;br /&gt;7. Small Eye shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;8. Blusher Brush&lt;br /&gt;9. Multifunction Foundation Brush&lt;br /&gt;10. Multifunction Blush Brush&lt;br /&gt;11. Mini Kabuki Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice pouch in which you can store and also can carry it easily in your purse. Its one of the most cost effective make up brushes out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Had to return...brush head was Bent permanently on one brush &amp; they smelled sooooo bad like chemicals (glue was a guess)..DIDNT WANT DUE TO THIS</li>
    <li> Worth it!! Brushes are super soft</li>
    <li> I love it amazing thanks 💓</li>
    <li> Perfect for every need. Terrific brushes.</li>
    <li> Soft and very reliable to smooth all makeup.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!! They are super soft and so far none of the bristles have fallen out of any of the brushes. Just wish it came with a big blending brush.</li>
    <li> I really love these synthetic brushes and you can&#x27;t beat the price. They are great quality and blend my makeup very nicely! I seriously love these brushes and would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Nice set of makeup brushes</li>
    <li> I go through makeup brushes like wildfire.&lt;br /&gt;Not because I&#x27;m applying the face paint multiple times a day, but because the germ-a-phobe in me is constantly sanitizing them. Hot water, detergent, and sprays with alcohol really take a toll on brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Under twenty bucks for brushes that are a decent quality?&lt;br /&gt;Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to a first use they were sanitized and went through the experience with flying colors.&lt;br /&gt;Not a $100 set, but a decent value set.&lt;br /&gt;They had a chemical smell that dissipated after being sanitized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE : Product received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. Views and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Nice quality for the money. I have been using them for a while and wash them after every use. They stay in shape and don&#x27;t loose bristles, like some other brushes I had.</li>
    <li> Love them! The price was awesome too. They&#x27;re super soft and I love how many come with this kit.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really good. They are very soft and apply makeup nicely. And for such a great price. Other reviewers mentioned a smell, but I don&#x27;t think they have a smell at all. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> GREAT, set!!!  If you are tired of spending $30-$40 on ONE brush, this is a phenomenal set of brushes! EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS MAC BRUSHES! Theses brushes are very soft, very well made and transfer color perfectly. The brush sets selection of brushes is perfect for what you need for blending, foundation, eye make up, countering, highlighting, lips, blush, and eye liner. This is such a good deal I ordered another set for my daughter. You will LOVE these brushes!!!  Don&#x27;t pass these up, they are worth every dime!</li>
    <li> These are nice brushes and while I don&#x27;t have much experience with makeup brushes, as a painter I can spot a bad brush. These are very soft and they apply blush and powder and eye shadow very well. I was very skeptical they would be any good due to the price but I was pleasantly surprised. The bristles don&#x27;t shed cats and dogs  either as most cheap makeup brushes do. I noticed one bristle or two came loose after I first got them but I don&#x27;t recall any falling out since then, or haven&#x27;t noticed. They seem to pick up pigment and the particulate matter of loose powder and blushes really well and the application is really good. I would recommend these to a friend. And I didn&#x27;t receive these as part of a promotion in return for a review either.</li>
    <li> The second brush in the pic , L to R, started losing hairs like crazy. Not good with liquid makeup.  The rest are fine, But that brush is the most important one to me...you must was these before use.  The handles are nice.</li>
    <li> Super soft, everyday use, I love these brushes !</li>
    <li> I received my brushes today.  They were secured in a handy pouch to keep them all together.  The brushes are very soft and fluffy and the wooden handles are well varnished.  Overall they are very durable and I anticipate long life.  Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> You should clean the brushes first before you use them. Just wash with warm water and a little shampoo and soak for 30 mins, to eliminate any smell. After that you just use shampoo and water to get rid of old make-up residue. Most importantly, leave the brushes to air dry with the hair end pointing downwards.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes come individually wrapped in an orange velvety drawstring bag and a manual. It includes Foundation Brush, Big Eye shadow Brush, High Light Brush, Eye Smudge Brush, Concealer Brush, Eyebrow Brush, Small Eye shadow Brush, Blusher Brush, Eyelash Brush, Multifunction Foundation Brush, Multifunction Blush Brush, Mini Kabuki Brush&lt;br /&gt;My three daughters have been testing these, and unfortunately there has been a tug of war to test them and a second set of Golden Black brushes. They are excellent quality with really fine hair and are easy to both use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;The set is really god value for money when you thin about how much you pay for individual brushes, especially Kabuki brushes. Just one can cost the same price as this whole set.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 5 stars based on the product you get for the price.  If you are look for high end quality then I suggest paying high end prices where often 1 brush is the cost of this entire set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush handles are smooth without flaw, so no splinters basically. Bristles stay on the brush and not on your face. They are a great length and actually soft enough.  Yes the higher end brushes have these super soft, fine luxury bristles. These are soft enough and do just fine.  I use every brush in the set ( for eye shadow, liquid make up, powder, bronzer, eye liner), and will buy another set for my daughter.  So far I have soaked and washed the brushes 3 times (once with dawn and twice with baby shampoo) with a vigorous rubbing in the palm of my hand and a few go rounds in the bowl, no bristles few out, all the brushes held up nicely and dried quick enough.</li>
    <li> All  the brushes are good quality and there is a nice assortment of sizes and shapes.  There is no shedding, I have washed them three times so far and the quality remained excellent. The price is fantastic, they are very equal in quality to more expensive brushes. I would definitely buy them again and recommend them to friends.</li>
    <li> I love using these brushes - they feel so good - so very soft.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  Very nice packaging and very soft.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes, I am very pleased with the quality. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, but did not work for me. I used one to apply loose powder and had an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Very soft! And great to blend with but my batch came looking a little frayed, I received two days ago and already notice them :( overall still great brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> Love them it&#x27;s all u need 🙌🏻</li>
    <li> Love the brushes so far. Just opened the box and removed them from orange bag. The orange bag itself smells like formaldehyde but the brushes do not which is good. Product took exactly 2 days to get here. I&#x27;m totally impressed with these brushes. I&#x27;ll be posting another review after i use them.  But they definitely get 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> Good selection of brushes. I use them daily.</li>
    <li> Super high quality, was shocked at how nice they are for the price.</li>
    <li> I gave them as a gift to someone just starting to get into make up.  I showed her how to use them and realized it was not a good brush set to start out with. The shorter brushes are not comfortable to use, they feel awkward. The longer brushes are ok for a inexpensive set ( there is no way they were discounted from $59) I think they serve a purpose for now.</li>
    <li> The brushes are super soft and feel wonderful on the skin</li>
    <li> These brushes are really perfect for someone who&#x27;s starting out in makeup and wants a good quality set without spending the big price tag to have a bunch of brushes that they don&#x27;t know what their for! This set has the right amount of brushes, for everyday makeup use. I love how soft they are, but they pick up product and disperse it very well. My favorite brush is the pencil brush, its stiff enough to give me a solid line, and small enough to get into my crease and blend as well. Each brush is dense, and soft. Perfect for eyeshadow, eyeliner, foundation and contouring! There was little to no fallout I noticed. The name is written on the handle of each brush, which is solid as well. The only thing i didn&#x27;t care for was the burnt orange carrying bag. However, these are perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
    <li> Excellent, excellent EXCELLENT product.  Items arrived early, although I paid extra money to have my order come quickly. I am more than pleased with these make up brushes.They look exactly as they are described. Also the brushes have a good heavy feel to them. I am so lucky to have purchased such good brushes at such an awesome price.I will definitely be reordering this set in the future if I ever need to .</li>
    <li> Really good quality for brushes .&lt;br /&gt;Came in on time !</li>
    <li> Wow, what a nice selection of beautiful, soft brushes you get in this pack!! This is what I call high-quality. I&#x27;m used to brushes with plastic handles not wooden but prefer these wooden handle brushes a lot more. They feel really nice in my hands and don&#x27;t feel cheap. They&#x27;re a joy to use. They&#x27;re softer than any makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever used in the past. They&#x27;re easy to clean too and remain soft after cleaning (unlike some I&#x27;ve had that harden and get rougher).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to look at some videos on YouTube because I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use some of the brushes. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup and when I do it&#x27;s only a couple times a week. However, now that I have this nice selection of brushes and know what each one is for (thanks to a few YouTube channels), I&#x27;ll probably wear it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a large selection of brushes and don&#x27;t want to break the bank or your wallet, this is a good choice. I truly thought they would feel cheap or at least not be so soft, but I was so wrong. My mineral powder and eye shadows have never looked so great on my skin! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> Great quality, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! I use almost all of them every day and they work really well.</li>
    <li> While these brushes are not as high quality as some more expensive brands, they aren&#x27;t beauty supply quality either--just a happy in-between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: they&#x27;re soft and synthetic, so they don&#x27;t steal your liquid or cream products, they&#x27;re pretty durable and they look exactly like the picture. They come with grooming instructions, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Cons&amp;#34;: yes, they shed. But, from using them about 5 times since I recieved them 2 weeks ago, I&#x27;ve only counted 2 loose hairs on my face. Also, the brush guide is just a tad bit inaccurate. The large flat brush IS NOT for your eyes lol. (I personally don&#x27;t think that any of these factors take away from the actual product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy these for a friend who&#x27;s getting started in makeup!</li>
    <li> Some smell when I first opened it, but they feel very soft and do not shed hair. As a beginner to use brushes, they are good enough!</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Obviously a bunch of people got the brushes free in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;THE BRUSHES ARE LOW QUALITY!&lt;br /&gt;The packaging smells like cheap plastic and so do the brushes...which is not a big deal but the bristles started&lt;br /&gt;falling out as soon as I took them out of their plastic baggies.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says the brushes are soft and they are, but they are TOO SOFT to apply makeup properly. The foundation&lt;br /&gt;brush is not densely packed enough to provide proper coverage and literally all of the brushes look more like cheap&lt;br /&gt;dollar store arts and crafts brushes than makeup tools. The bristles are way too long on the eye brushes and none&lt;br /&gt;of the handles are labeled (which is not a big deal but even the descriptions are off on the manual...  it says the second&lt;br /&gt;biggest brush is for eyeshadow...it is so big, it could not possibly be used for eyeshadow)&lt;br /&gt;I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!&lt;br /&gt;Not even worth $13, which is a steal...in this case, it really is a steal of money :(</li>
    <li> The package came early (which I was happy about). All the brushes seem fine and soft to me &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> Good quality. Im impressed. . Thank you</li>
    <li> I loveee this makeup brush set!!! I would totally recommend it. I am thinking of buying another set for my sister. The brushes are very soft and so far no shredding. The only drawback is they are not labeled as which brush is for what use. Other than that this set is fabulous!!</li>
    <li> Very good brushes for how inexpensive they were. Service was great, I got my shipment weeks before I was supposed to. The set has every single kind of makeup brush I need.</li>
    <li> These are really nice brushes. I have bought a different brand in the past and the hairs kept coming out when I used them. so far these have been great.</li>
    <li> Because it shows that the  case  of the brushes was nat  a  morral...it was like a long  carpet whit  a packet  for each  brush. .</li>
    <li> Great quality for a low price</li>
    <li> These are FABULOUS! I got them literally a week before &amp; they&#x27;re simply amazing. At first I was upset bc I had to wait a month before I got them but they came in early so that was a pleasant surprise! I got all 11 like promised, they&#x27;re SUPER SOFT &amp; they do have an odor but it&#x27;s not a major issue. Did I mention it&#x27;s super cheap?! Got to have em ladies :-)</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are so soft. I absolutely love them. Better than high end brushes. Can be used everyday for makeup. Feel great on your face. Would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes for the money.</li>
    <li> Loving my new makeup brushes! They are amazing! I love all the different sizes and styles. one for every need!</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes! Easy to use &amp; severe l are lightweight in the hand. Enjoy using</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for the price!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping,  great brushes...nice and soft, I love the wooden handles,  am gonna get another set for my girl friend.</li>
    <li> I like how it applies my makeup.</li>
    <li> Love the wood and the hairs perfect  brushes for eye shadows</li>
    <li> Bought two sets as Christmas gifts. They are nice quality brushes &amp; both recipients liked them. Great set for the price. May buy one for myself also.</li>
    <li> I wish it had like a label or numbers but I love it</li>
    <li> Bristles are soft....great for makeup application</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about these brushes, but bought them anyway and WOW they are awesome! The bamboo handles are lovely, the sliver part (can&#x27;t remember the actual name) are very good quality, and the brushes are firm and soft. I love the price! I love the quality. Definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> They are not style master brushes I want a refund false information given.</li>
    <li> The shipping took a little long but it was  all worth it for the quality of  the brushes  very pleased with the buy!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very pretty in person great packaging ... looks as described. Has a smell but nothing you cant wash out</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft!! They work really well. Super happy since the price is right. Yes they do have a smell but I washed them right away and I can&#x27;t smell it anymore...</li>
    <li> Have yet to use the brushes, so can&#x27;t write a full review. But ... these look like what I&#x27;d expected. Seem to be of good quality and should hold up over time.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really soft. I washed them as recommended before using them the first time and no hairs came out. After using them for a while I still haven&#x27;t seen any hairs fall out. I recently went from great skin to a horrible adult acne breakout. I had been using my previous brushes forever, so I figured maybe it was time to get a new set. While my old brushes turned out not to be the source of my acne these are still wonderful and I&#x27;m glad I got new ones. There are A LOT of brushes here and I only use about half of them. But for the price who cares? And the concealer brush doesn&#x27;t do the best job of blending in concealer (more like wiped it off the blemish you&#x27;re trying to conceal). But again, for the price, who cares? I can easily afford to buy a concealer brush to replace it. For such soft brushes that are easy to use and clean I&#x27;m not worried about one being a dud. I also wish though that there was a liquid foundation brush. It&#x27;s not a huge deal that it&#x27;s missing because I have a beauty sponge. But it would be nice because one of my liquid foundations work better with a brush than the sponge. But, again, something I&#x27;m not all that concerned about. I wash these AT LEAST once a week (sometimes more) with castile soap or shampoo and they&#x27;ve held up great. Soft clean brushes don&#x27;t aggravate my acne which is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes they are super soft. The bag and brushes do have the chemical smell everyone is talking about.</li>
    <li> Excellent sellers. I recommend 100%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neyeska.</li>
    <li> I got the bamboo set, its definitely a get what you pay for set. Some of the brushes seem to be great and other feel like the bristles are too long and a few have alrwady come out even before I used it. Id advise to pay a little more for better quality, because thia is the sort of thing u dont generally replace every couple mos</li>
    <li> I have had these brushes for quite some time now. I can honestly say how much I love them. Always my first concern with makeup brushes is how well they stand up to regular cleaning. Some alright, some not, bristles coming out before , during and after cleaning them. These hold up well. I have already cleaned them three times. The bristles held up well , kept their shape, and none came out . The way I clean them is I soak them in a clear glass, about 1 or 2 minutes, about  1/4&amp;#34; past the bristles with the cleanser I use on my face. Swishing them around only a couple times,  removing them, running them under very warm water, rolling them back &amp; forth in a clean towel then squeezing the bristles, fanning them out of excess water &amp; letting them air dry, laying flat.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are all full, size makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The measurements on these brushes are (FOLLOW THE MEASUREMENTS WITH PHOTO PROVIDED);&lt;br /&gt;FOUNDATION BRUSH - 6 3/4&amp;#34; LONG&lt;br /&gt;CREAM/LIQUID FOUND ATI ON BRUSH - 6 3/4&amp;#34; LONG&lt;br /&gt;MINI KABUKI BRUSH - 2 1/2&amp;#34; LONG&lt;br /&gt;BRONZER BRUSH - (FLAT TOP BRISTLES) - 4 1/4&amp;#34; LONG&lt;br /&gt;BRUSH BRUSH - (ROUND TOP BRISTLES) - 4 1/4&amp;#34; LONGER&lt;br /&gt;EYESHADOW BRUSH - 5&amp;#34; LONG&lt;br /&gt;CONCEALER BRUSH - 6&amp;#34; LONG&lt;br /&gt;ANGLED EYESHADOW BRUSH- 6 1/4&amp;#34; LONG&lt;br /&gt;MULTI-TASK BRUSH - 7 1/2&amp;#34;LONGER&lt;br /&gt;EYESHADOW SMUDGE BRUSH - 6 1/4&amp;#34;LONG&lt;br /&gt;EYELINER BRUSH - 5 3/4&amp;#34; LONG&lt;br /&gt;The handles on these great brushes are a bamboo wood. Very nicely finished, no worries about splintering.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very, very soft, yet durable enough to handle all your makeup needs.The $$$ is what first got my attention, now I&#x27;m purchasing 2 more sets for my two daughter - inlaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;👌THANKS FOR READING, BYE👍</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve had good experience with these brushes. The bristles do not fall out, great selection, seem like good quality. Only wish there was a guide for which brush is which, but for someone who knows what they are doing it&#x27;s probably not a big deal</li>
    <li> My sister liked these. I bought them for her for her birthday and she really loved them. She uses them everyday.</li>
    <li> THESE BRUSHES!!! Why would you pay 15,20.50 dollars for one brush when you can get this brush set. This set is soft and does everything expensive brushes can, they feel good in my hands, they don&#x27;t feel or look cheap at all. WORTH THE BUY YOU WONT REGRET IT!</li>
    <li> Soft, durable brushes. Had them for two weeks and love them so far. Each brush has its own purpose and fulfills it perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great brushes , for this price. I&#x27;m satisfied :)</li>
    <li> These came in sooo early and these brushes are super soft. They did have a weird smell to them when they first arrived, however after you wash them everything is A okay.</li>
    <li> This is a nice starter set of brushes. I&#x27;m used to the drug store type that sheds so badly but so far so good with these. I think I&#x27;ve used all of them at this point - and they just came today. Maybe not the little kabuki, which is so cute, but the rest, yeah. Used them, love them. If only there was a fluffy powder brush, this set would be complete. I&#x27;m considering ordering a second set so that I always have clean, dry brushes on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are so soft. I&#x27;m loving the white tips because you can see the amount of makeup on them - unless the color is white. So easy to use. Hoping they are durable.</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft ! They work very well with my make up ! Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> EMAX DESIGN MAKEUP BRUSHES PROFESSIONAL 11 PIECES.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT.</li>

    <li> I love these brushes. They worked perfectly for what I needed them for!</li>
    <li> easy to use brushes a step up from my others especially the shorter ones</li>
    <li> Brushes work very well for the price</li>
    <li> Great quality, they don&#x27;t hurt my cheeks like my bare mineral brushes do, and they came on time</li>
    <li> The are awesome.  No prob. Applies makeup smooth and easy</li>
    <li> 100% recommended excellent product</li>
    <li> This is a great set of brushes. I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding. Nothing let&#x27;s left behind on my face. The bristles are soft. I have not had any reaction with this brushes at all. The brushes pick up the perfect amount of make up.&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed at how easily I can clean these brushes without losing any bristles.  After cleaning the brushes are just as soft as the day they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;This is a l large set with excellent sized bamboo handles.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic price!!&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly impressed!!</li>

The set includes 11 makeup brushes, an orange drawstring bag and product description sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each makeup brush comes wrapped individually in a protective plastic cover. The brush handles are made of bamboo and are imprinted with EmaxDesign. The handmade synthetic fiber bristles are really soft on your skin. The bristles are attached securely with a silver metal ferrule. I have not experiences any shedding from the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup brushes comes nestled in a cute orange drawstring pouch. This comes in handy for storage or when traveling. The pouch is approximately 8.25” x 4.5”. It securely holds all 11 makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included is a product description sheet which lets you know what each brush is for. It also provides details on how to maintain your brushes to keep them clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really enjoyed these makeup brushes and they bag definitely came in handy when I went on a mini vacation over the weekend. It kept my brushes all together and protected them from getting dirty. Even after weeks of use, these brushes are still soft and fluffy. They seem to be very durable. I received this product to test in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This set of makeup brushes would make an excellent gift option for any teen or grown woman.</li>
    <li> On the first use of one of the brushes the bristles fell out, all of them, as I was putting on eyeshadow. I still use the others, but not great quality. Good price, just be aware of what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price. I only wish it came with a piece of paper telling what all of the brushes are for!</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.  They were exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> After a month the hais start falling out</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes!!  All of them work awesome they don&#x27;t hurt my skin or make it red</li>
    <li> Bought as gift for my daughter, but she loves them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing, I cant believe the price!! I bought these because I didn&#x27;t want to pay a fortune on two brushes I needed, and found this set that had them (and many others) for way less than I expected. I was hesitant but for the price I went for it. These are very soft, I use most of them regularly and none of them have shed. I have had these for over a year and bristles look good as new. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So soft and luxurious.</li>
    <li> Small size, thought they were bigger but they&#x27;re ok.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! :)</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes. Was shipped quickly. I&#x27;m happy with the product :)</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes, and they&#x27;re wonderful! Can&#x27;t wait to start using them.</li>
    <li> I love them!! I bought two extra sets for my sisters and my mom, they love them too!! #greatpurchase</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! Exactly what I was wanting.</li>
    <li> great coverage brushes, great price for a good product, fibers of the brush dont come out this set is well made for everyday use</li>
    <li> These brushes are exactly what I was looking for, and I am extremely pleased with the purchase.  The bamboo handles are very nice, wipe off clean, and easy to hold.  I use different ones for applying and blending.  They are soft, which is good for the face, and wash well.  I would purchase again.  Product arrived even earlier than expected, and the packaging was well done.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend. She said that they are soft and perfect. She wants to order more because she loves them so much.</li>
