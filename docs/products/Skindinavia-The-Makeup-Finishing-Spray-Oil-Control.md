<ol>
      <li>The wear throughout the day is perfect.</li>
      <li>Works great!  </li>
      <li>So happy to have found this life saver!</li>
      <li>Tried &#x27;em all, but Skindinavia is the best one yet!</li>
      <li>Glasses are staying in place, phones are perfectly clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Awesome stuff!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s done a wonderful job.</li>
      <li>and it was still flawless and no shine!</li>
      <li>I decided to use ELF translucent powder before setting and it was PERFECT!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!!!</li>
      <li>A great solution to fading makeup...</li>
      <li>I was so happy.</li>
      <li>Still good value.</li>
      <li>Good finishing spray that helps my makeup stay on longer</li>
      <li>I have combination skin, and still get more oily than I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s not this products fault that I&#x27;m so oily!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know why people bother putting makeup on if they aren&#x27;t going to use it.</li>
      <li>Your makeup, even matte finishes still look natural and flawless.</li>
      <li>Love love love this, makeup stays preserved all day!</li>
      <li>This is better.  </li>
      <li>feel like it works better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered the 8 oz bottle,</li>
      <li>I use it as a primer and a finishing spray during the warmer months since I tend to get more oily.</li>
      <li>Yes, you still will get a bit oily, but this helps control my oil so much more than if I didn&#x27;t wear it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it promises to do, and I am thrilled!</li>
      <li>If you put a lot of time into doing your makeup this is so worthwhile because you won&#x27;t have to touch it up during the day and you won&#x27;t have to worry about it fading or smudging.</li>
      <li>It is noon, and there is absolutely no oil on my face, and the foundation is still perfectly in place.  </li>
      <li>It works great and helps powdered makeup look non-cakey and natural.</li>
      <li>I wear a fair amount of makeup but it always looks natural because this takes away the cakey, powdery look and blends everything so its more smooth.</li>
      <li>LOVE that I discovered this beauty gem ;-)</li>
      <li>This makeup setting spray is pure magic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn it to 2 theme parks, full day (Disneyland and Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm IN THE SUMMER).</li>
      <li>but I have a super oily face.  </li>
      <li>I use it in TX where it&#x27;s very hot and humid.</li>
      <li>, you will still need Blotting sheets (I love Clean &amp; Clear).</li>
      <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;Apply this when you are all finished with your makeup - but the most important step, I find, is after it is mostly dried, apply a light layer of translucent powder on top of it.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>Another cool trick, if you have spots that really need to be covered you can spray this before you apply your concealer or powder so that it will stick from underneath as well.</li>
      <li>I have super oily skin and absolutely depend on this product.</li>
      <li>Better, lasting results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It kept my makeup in tact even under hot lights.</li>
      <li>and I really cannot imagine living without this now that I have it!</li>
      <li>Yes, you still sweat,especially on hot days</li>
      <li>While this product does have a nice smell to it, it lacked in all the other areas.</li>
      <li>Just let it dry before you apply anything on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also use it to spray lightly on my eyeshadow (shimmer colors) to help attain a stronger and more long lasting color wear.  </li>
      <li>That sets the bar pretty damn high, and it made it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Then it will really be set ALL DAY.</li>
      <li>I just use the spray before I leave the house, and I don&#x27;t really touch up on my make up except for lips and</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>After performing in two live dance shows, I found that I did not need to so much as blot my face for shine.</li>
      <li>so my highlight stays vibrant.</li>
      <li>so its a constant struggle to maintain the right moisture balance for my face to keep it from overproducing oil or getting too</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;ve tried this oil-control formula, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>It does not leave my skin looking dry, it does not change the color of my foundation, it actually gives the powder foundation a smoother and more natural looking texture.  </li>
      <li>Especially in the hot summer months.</li>
      <li>I still have to use an oil blotter around my t-zone, but this really extends the life of my overall makeup look.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t cause me any breakouts like with all the other drugstore ones I&#x27;ve tried, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s worth the money for me.  </li>
      <li>I normally get 2 hours before the foundation is absolutely gone from my face due to the oil.  </li>
      <li>This product sucks up all the excess oils without leaving your face looking super flat and lifeless.</li>

<li> I will go back to using Urban Decay&#x27;s De Slick.</li>
<li> Do both, not one or the other.</li>
<li> I have EXTREMELY oily skin.</li>
<li> I cannot compare it to any other primer/setting spray other than smashbox primer water.  </li>
<li> Not worth the cost,  </li>
<li> My glasses slide down my nose, my phone has yucky oil marks on the screen for cell or handset for office phone.&lt;br /&gt;Today I used a powder foundation, applied at 7:30 this morning, and sprayed this setting spray on as directed.  </li>
<li> I live in a dry, cold climate (Wyoming)</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s been a little less than a month.</li>
<li> I used this and the first time, I think I got  little overzealous and sprayed too much so my makeup looked awful.</li>
<li> I still get a little bit oily</li>
<li> A little goes along way.</li>
<li> I also like to re-apply some blush/highlighter after it is dried</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t get as oily as usual.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve worn this at least 2-3 a week</li>
<li> I hated wearing makeup because it usually look AWFUL by the end of the day, if it wasn&#x27;t gone from me blotting every hour.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good finishing spray that helps my makeup stay on longer and I don&#x27;t get as oily as usual. I still get a little bit oily but I have a super oily face.  It didn&#x27;t cause me any breakouts like with all the other drugstore ones I&#x27;ve tried, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s worth the money for me.  I use it in TX where it&#x27;s very hot and humid.</li>
    <li> I use this product with the primer spray and this combo is my ride or die! I honesty don&#x27;t know how I have lived my life without it.</li>
    <li> I have the most absurdly oily skin.  I have tried EVERYTHING to help extend the life of my foundation - primers, setting powders, setting sprays, blotting, long wearing foundations.  I normally get 2 hours before the foundation is absolutely gone from my face due to the oil.  My glasses slide down my nose, my phone has yucky oil marks on the screen for cell or handset for office phone.&lt;br /&gt;Today I used a powder foundation, applied at 7:30 this morning, and sprayed this setting spray on as directed.  It is noon, and there is absolutely no oil on my face, and the foundation is still perfectly in place.  Glasses are staying in place, phones are perfectly clean.&lt;br /&gt;I have never before found a product that does this. It does not leave my skin looking dry, it does not change the color of my foundation, it actually gives the powder foundation a smoother and more natural looking texture.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered the 8 oz bottle, and I really cannot imagine living without this now that I have it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now.  I cannot compare it to any other primer/setting spray other than smashbox primer water.  This is better.  I also use it to spray lightly on my eyeshadow (shimmer colors) to help attain a stronger and more long lasting color wear.  Works great!  I do use it all over my face before I apply my mascara and lip stick.  I have combination skin, and still get more oily than I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s not this products fault that I&#x27;m so oily!  Still good value.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff religiously. I am oily in my t-zone and especially around my nose. I live in a dry, cold climate (Wyoming) so its a constant struggle to maintain the right moisture balance for my face to keep it from overproducing oil or getting too dry.&lt;br /&gt;Apply this when you are all finished with your makeup - but the most important step, I find, is after it is mostly dried, apply a light layer of translucent powder on top of it. Then it will really be set ALL DAY. I also like to re-apply some blush/highlighter after it is dried so my highlight stays vibrant. This works just as well as Urban Decay&#x27;s all nighter spray, if not better, and is offered in larger bottles so it takes a lot longer to get through one of these. I think it&#x27;s totally worth the price. I&#x27;m on like, my 5th bottle. I wear a fair amount of makeup but it always looks natural because this takes away the cakey, powdery look and blends everything so its more smooth. If you put a lot of time into doing your makeup this is so worthwhile because you won&#x27;t have to touch it up during the day and you won&#x27;t have to worry about it fading or smudging. Another cool trick, if you have spots that really need to be covered you can spray this before you apply your concealer or powder so that it will stick from underneath as well. Just let it dry before you apply anything on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically anyone who wears makeup can benefit from a setting spray. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know why people bother putting makeup on if they aren&#x27;t going to use it.</li>
    <li> Not worth the cost,  does not control oil or shine</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! I have EXTREMELY oily skin. I could wash my face, walk into the room and put my clothes and could already see my t-zone rebelling. I hated wearing makeup because it usually look AWFUL by the end of the day, if it wasn&#x27;t gone from me blotting every hour. I used this and the first time, I think I got  little overzealous and sprayed too much so my makeup looked awful. I decided to use ELF translucent powder before setting and it was PERFECT! I was so happy. I looked at my face around noon and it was still flawless and no shine! I would definitely recommend this to anyone battling with oily skin.</li>
    <li> Makeup does stay in place, but it has a tendency to transfer to clothing.</li>
    <li> I have super oily skin and absolutely depend on this product. In the summer time, it keeps my makeup in place all day (if I&#x27;m not profusely sweating of course). I still have to use an oil blotter around my t-zone, but this really extends the life of my overall makeup look.</li>
    <li> Love love love this, makeup stays preserved all day!</li>
    <li> This finish spray works!! It rids me of any makeup disaster possible. I use it to set my makeup and don&#x27;t have to worry about my eyeliner smudging, lipstick bleeding, blush/contour fading AND any kinds of oily skin mishaps. It&#x27;s been part of my daily routine for about 2 years now and can&#x27;t go without it. I keep my travel size finish spray in my makeup bag that I carry in my purse as well. LOVE that I discovered this beauty gem ;-)</li>
    <li> This product is EVERYTHING. I&#x27;ve been using skindinavia products for some time now. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This product sucks up all the excess oils without leaving your face looking super flat and lifeless. Your makeup, even matte finishes still look natural and flawless. The wear throughout the day is perfect. Especially in the hot summer months. It&#x27;s a must have in my makeup routine.</li>
    <li> I use it as a primer and a finishing spray during the warmer months since I tend to get more oily. It works great and helps powdered makeup look non-cakey and natural. I use this daily and it&#x27;s the one thing that keeps my makeup on all day.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin. And after reading the reviews and product description I thought I would try this out. It did not work whatsoever. I found myself having to touch up my makeup after about 2hrs of applying it. While this product does have a nice smell to it, it lacked in all the other areas. I understand that everyones skin type is different however this product was not for me. I will go back to using Urban Decay&#x27;s De Slick. That one has always worked for me.</li>
    <li> Switched to this from the urban decay finishing spray. will go back to urban decay. feel like it works better.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!! Keeps your makeup on even if you perspire like a man.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It does exactly what it promises to do, and I am thrilled! A great solution to fading makeup...makeup stays put all day and night!</li>
    <li> Tried &#x27;em all, but Skindinavia is the best one yet! Now that I&#x27;ve tried this oil-control formula, I can&#x27;t live without it. I finally found a way to combat my oily t-zone. No shiny forehead and my my makeup stays put all day long. I don&#x27;t even need to touch up after work. So happy to have found this life saver!</li>
    <li> Skindinavia makes Urban Decay&#x27;s setting spray. That sets the bar pretty damn high, and it made it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, so my T-zone is a bit of a hassle to work with, but my gosh this product does the trick. Yes, you still will get a bit oily, but this helps control my oil so much more than if I didn&#x27;t wear it. I&#x27;ve worn this at least 2-3 a week and it&#x27;s been a little less than a month. I&#x27;ve worn it to 2 theme parks, full day (Disneyland and Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm IN THE SUMMER). It&#x27;s done a wonderful job. I just use the spray before I leave the house, and I don&#x27;t really touch up on my make up except for lips and eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended Steps:&lt;br /&gt;1. After you finish applying your make up. Use finishing powder to set your make up, and THEN use the spray. Do both, not one or the other. Better, lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;2. Yes, you still sweat,especially on hot days, you will still need Blotting sheets (I love Clean &amp; Clear). You will notice that you don&#x27;t need to blot as often and make up doesn&#x27;t melt off (I&#x27;ve used this with BB cream and Powder + Mineral Foundation)</li>
    <li> I love it. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> This makeup setting spray is pure magic. After performing in two live dance shows, I found that I did not need to so much as blot my face for shine. It kept my makeup in tact even under hot lights. I did not need to reapply anything but my lipstick. A little goes along way.</li>
