<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Very well package will buy from company again</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING!!!! Highly recommend! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is my first SHANY cosmetic purchase and I wish I found this makeup line sooner !! I tried this item a few days ago for the first time and the eyeshadows went on like silk..They are vibrant, high pigmented and they stayed on even after a very long day of work without fading or melting away like many other brands that I have tried..I am 100% satisified with my purchase and I will definitely be buying more items in the very near future..</li>
    <li> Love this eye shadow! obviously i have my favorites in it but they are all good colors, go on well, and last quite a while.</li>
    <li> I love all of the colors. Very Natural. Very easy to blend. I Highly Recommend it</li>
    <li> Im very dark and finding colors that show up on my skin that aren&#x27;t ashy is a task.. these colors are very pigmented. I only need to use a little at a time. Love This.. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this..</li>
    <li> I love it .. However the Black one is broken and it got all over everything .. easy clean up tho...&lt;br /&gt;.. I never use black shadow so I don&#x27;t really care that its broken but someone else might that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.. the colors are beatiful and they go on easy..</li>
    <li> i love it, very usefull, and  good quality, perfect for have everything in one piece, a lot of good combinations</li>
    <li> Im happy I bought this since im trying to broaden my make up horizons. The sizes of the shadows arent that small nothing to complain about. I like how most colors are neutrals. Ive used a different one every day since I got them in the mail over a week ago. Some are shimmery/sheer and some are a matte and I love them both. Im very happy i purchased this.</li>
    <li> The product was nicely packaged in bubble wrap, in a box, which was in more bubble wrap, and yet the black color was damaged and all over everything. It got all over my hands, my legs, and my bed sheets. Thankfully, I can say that it washes off of skin easily (the sheets are still washing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have put in for a replacement, so hopefully that one will not be damaged and I will be able to try out these colors. I will update my review when the new product arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 06/20/2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my replacement product today and it was worse than the first. Multiple colors were broken and scattered all over. It was a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed, and I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> oh my gosh,the best eye shadow palette.so nice colors n easy to use. i&#x27;m so happy.thanks Amazon...</li>
    <li> I loved all the shades it came with. The eye shadow stays on and it is very fun to use when you want to play around with your look!</li>
    <li> A lot smaller then I expected. Each color is only about the size of a dime, but the texture is great and you don&#x27;t need a lot, a little goes a long way. The colors are beautiful. By far the best eye shadow I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> The palette is a great collection of colors for those of us that don&#x27;t have a lot of money. I wanted to purchase an Urban Decay palette but it was $50. I decided to see what else was out there. This is a much more affordable option and it has so many more colors! The colors are deep and long lasting. I also purchased a good eye shadow primer and that also allows for the color to last a long time. Each color is usable, it&#x27;s not like some palettes that have so many colors and sadly only some can be used. You won&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the Bold and Bright collection (120 color) I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now and the colors are great!  I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Friday, and got it Monday! When I opened the palette I was in aww with all the beautiful colors!! I used it today and I love it! I couldn&#x27;t decide which colors to use! I usually buy all my eyeshadows from MAC.....save your money!! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this. :)</li>
    <li> this is my first time buying this thing, and im happy that i never get disappointed it&#x27;s really easy to use, not hard to remove and i love the color it look so natural.. over all i love it and i would definitely recommend this to everyone!.</li>
    <li> LOVED how well they worked on eyes, great product. WORTH buying</li>
    <li> Each eye shadow is about the size of a dime. This a great natural palette!</li>
    <li> Excellent cost-benefit. You can combine and use a variety of colors. My fiancÃ©e loved it</li>
    <li> I recently received the natural fusion palette and with the packaging the black eyeshadow pigment crumbled and fell all over the other eye shadows and all over the box as well it was f*** disgusting. I had to clean it off with 10-15 lysol wipes because it was so pigmented. The product itself is surprisingly very good quality; with the right brushes and primer (which I use) it spreads very evenly and the colors are gorgeous. My only complaint is the s***ty packaging and that I lost one whole pigment off of it. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This palette is perfect for professional or home makeup. The shades, texture and pricing are amazing. I will definitely order again! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love it. Package came in perfect nothing broken and the colors are beautiful!! I&#x27;m so happy I took a picture and sent it to all my friends. Plus it&#x27;s great quality, I swatched all the colors and it was so pigmented with one swipe. Beautiful.</li>
    <li> I just received my palette today, and I must say that this is an A+++ product. The colours are incredibly pigmented, all you need is just a tiny bit on your brush and you&#x27;re done. It&#x27;s really amazing. I am very dark skinned so its hard to find an eyeshadow that&#x27;s bright and noticeable on my skin tone but these colours are so vibrant and the texture is so smooth, like you really can&#x27;t find anything wrong with the quality of this eyeshadow. The only reason i gave it four stars rather than five is because its a little smaller than I thought it would be which is great when it comes to portability, but I love this palette so much I wish it came in a larger size. Each circle is about the size of a dime but when you consider how pigmented it is and how many colours there are the size isn&#x27;t really a big deal. I highly recommend this palette for every lady out there who is a little skeptical about large palettes. A lot of the time, companies sacrifice quantity for quality and you end up with 144 chalky eyeshadows (I&#x27;m throwing shade to the E.L.F. 144 Eyeshadow Palette) but this company is different. I&#x27;m really impressed with this palette.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box that the case comes in I was so happy that it was such good quality. Then, I noticed a weird black powder substance on it that got all over my hands it was not make up either. After wiping it off and opening the case I was a little disappointed because the circles of eye shadow are a lot smaller than I thought and I really dont think they will last very long.</li>
    <li> This is the best palette I&#x27;ve purchased, affordable and good quality! The colors are a little deeper than they seem, but they are textured right and stay on and blend well.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this palette and it was shipped really fast with my Amazon Prime membership. Unfortunately, when I opened the bubble wrap that the palette was wrapped in, my hands, arms and face were immediately covered in black. I tried cleaning the outside of it because I still wasn&#x27;t really sure what was going on. When i finally opened it, i discovered the darkest shade of black had exploded inside the palette causing the rest of the colors to have black mixed inside it as well. I&#x27;m now attempting to take a tissue and clean out the rest of the colors in hopes of being able to use them... but of course my hands still turn black every time I touch the palette case. I really wish I would have just bought a palette from in the store so then I could return it without having to pay to ship it back! I HIGHLY recommend not buying this or any other eye shadow palette on amazon because the shipping will probably destroy it.</li>
    <li> i thought for sure it would be broken..or melted being in the hot truck. it arrived on time the day it said it would i opened the package and there was powder kinda on the edge so i figured for SUure atleast 1 was broken. i opened it but nope it was alllllll perfect. the colors look SO AMAZING i tried some one my hand and it didnt really come out like it loks. so im waiting for my primer and maybe that will liven them up but other then that i cant wait to actually try these coolors on my eyes. such rich bright shimmery ones and some just plain ones . the case is very cute medium and compact i love it. (edited) so i did this when i first got it and i actually went somewehre the day i got it and i wore it. i put foundation on my eyelids and alil on the applicator and i put it on and it made a big difference the colors came out so prety just lke they show i think this is a good pallete for blue eyes! or green i have blue/green :D</li>
    <li> I just got it today! OMG i love it. The colors are so beautiful, and yes they are pigmented. It was packaged pretty good, but when i opened it, there was white powder all over it. I was like omg, im scared to look but no, lol. All of the eyeshadows were in place, except for one which was the white one, it had crumbled a little at the top, but hey there was still enough for me to use. i am going to purchase the other colors soon!!!</li>
    <li> The colors are perfect for neutral looks snd has shades that can make Smokey looks.  The colors are very pigmented so less is needed to accomplish the look.</li>
    <li> I LOVE SHANY EYESHADOW PALETTE!!!!! MY SKIN COLOR IS A COCO COLOR (AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN) AND THE SHANY COLORS ARE BEAUTIFUL ON MY SKIN. WOW! I am embarrassed to tell you how many eyeshadow palettes I own but I finally found my favorite makeup item. Sorry, but this is better than MAC. Save your money ladies.</li>
    <li> Just received my this product today and I am pleased with the packaging and the product itself. This is my first eyeshadow purchase and since I am beginner, I didn&#x27;t want to buy the expensive ones just yet; so based on the reviews, I purchased this palette. Since I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better than others but for $15, you get different wonderful finishes and a variety of nude / natural colors. Pigmentation was good, it&#x27;s not hard to apply or blend. It would be even better if used with a primer. The colors are about the size of a penny. Be extra careful in handling it though, the mirror might fall off; mine did but no biggie. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> need to use a lot of the eye shadow to come on smooth. I try a little squirt of water and then mix it with the shadow and it sticks to m y eyelids 100% better</li>
    <li> I think for what it cost it&#x27;s okay, the colors are pretty but the pigment is not quality but what do you expect. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> like the color combos possible with all the colors available in this set. it seems like there isn&#x27;t much of a difference in a few of the colors. some of the colors go on better wet than dry to avoid powder all over. I discovered a few colors that are great for the eyebrows. overall I really like this set, and will try other sets</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s wrong to say this \\&quot;out loud\\&quot;, and to some it might be sacrilegious, but I like this palette better than Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked and Naked 2. The consistency is creamy and the color pay-off is great, most of the matte colors transfer well to the skin. AND best of all, you have absolutely no trouble with fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to be careful with overblending though because one stroke too many can turn a smokey eye into a muddy mess, and you do want to use a primer to make the color vibrancy last all day, but that&#x27;s true of most eyeshadows really, so just be mindful and you&#x27;ll do fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let&#x27;s talk shipping... I own two Shany palettes, both of them arrived with broken shadows. You can repair them if that happens to you (you can find video tutorials on that all over the web), and normally I would lower my score of a product due to shipping/packaging issues, but I love the quality of the shadows themselves so much that I didn&#x27;t have the heart to lower my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great buy and a wonderful way to expand your color options if you&#x27;re stuck in the drugstore mini-palette vortex. :)</li>
    <li> I purchase a lot of make up and needed a fresh new Palette. Good value and quality. This Palette is true to the colors in it. The color transfers well so skin and the case is thin and easy to store. My only issue is that one of the colors came damaged. It probably happened during shipping. I was able to clean up the Palette and use with not further issues.</li>
    <li> Color didn&#x27;t stay, arrived broken. Should have spent more money for a better quality palette.</li>
    <li> I ordered this palette because the other Shany palette I have has such intense colors. I wanted something to tone it down a bit on days I didn&#x27;t want to wear my eyeshadow quite so dark. First of all, let me say that I do love the Shany eye-shadows--the colors are just beautiful and very concentrated, you actually have to be careful (until you get accustomed to applying it) not to apply too much.   The package arrived quickly and I was very satisfied with the time frame in which it arrived.   Unfortunately, this is not at all what I would consider a NUDE palette. It doesn&#x27;t look at all like the picture, even taking into consideration the differences in computer screen colors. Many of the colors are dark and I already have them in my other Shany palette. So, even though I love the colors and plan to keep the palette I am very disappointed that I did not get the colors I expected. Because of this I rated it with three stars.</li>
    <li> I choose a four star rating because, I got the makeup on time, but the black shadow was broken and the pieces and color got all over. Although, that is to be expected when it is sent in the mail. However the color stays on all day with no creasing, and is basically waterproof and sweat proof! I love all the colors, and I would recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> The colors are so beautiful, and work perfectly! A lot better than I expected for the price and it has such a good range of colors! The palette came super well wrapped for it not to break! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This was my first palette ever and i absolutely am in love with it! it was packaged perfectly with packaging peanuts and bubble wrapped twice! plus the actual palette was bubble wrapped inside the palette box!</li>
    <li> the colors are great but when I received the pack the black was EVERYWHERE and it was hard to clean it off without ruining the other colors. the way the compact is it not ideal. you cannot take it with you traveling, and if you do be sure to pack it separately and make sure that you don&#x27;t knock it around or you will ruin the colors and they might break and fall out. Not crazy about it, but love the colors and it serves it purpose.</li>
    <li> The shany pallet has beautiful colors, and they are quite pigmented considering how much I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Should have ordered (2). These shadows are better than Mac, that Iv&#x27;e been using for years and much more economical.</li>
    <li> I was pretty pleased with this product, theres more variety in the shades than you would thing, especially for neutral tones. This made it great for matching to outfits. A lot of the colors had a high gloss, or shimmer look to them which gave me even more options. The eye shadow goes on and doesn&#x27;t flake all over your face or smear badly like cheaper eye shadow does, and the color lasts for hours so theres no need to reaply at any point.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, they go on smoothly and last throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I love this one. It&#x27;s perfect . I recommend to my friends , it is a best gift for my mom. We love dat.</li>
    <li> My wife Ioves this product.  She praises the pigmentation and the fact that the makeup lasts all day without the need to touch up. The product does not &amp;#34;crease&amp;#34; either. We purchased a second set for a relative&#x27;s christmas gift; my wife&#x27;s set has lasted for about a year now and even her favorite colors have not run out. Excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> I got my palette today and spent some time doing swatches of each color on my arm.  The palette offers a mix of matte and shimmery shades, though I would say most of them are shimmery, and only about 3 have a lot of glitter in them.  The shadows are very buildable, but you do need to put on at least 2 layers of color for it to be really noticeable and even more for the matte shades, which isn&#x27;t different from a lot of eyeshadows in general. Most shades are pretty pigmented though. The colors range from light orange/ coral, peach, purples, browns, and taupes. The last column on the right of the palette is brown with a green tint. And there is a grey and black column in the center. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. The hard part will be choosing which shades to pair with each other.</li>
    <li> Good eyeshadows , a little smaller of what i expected but nice pigmentation</li>
    <li> This palette was extremely well packaged and hence in perfect condition when I received it. Looks like good quality make-up and the case is very elegant. I love it.</li>
    <li> the colors aren&#x27;t that bright but  the variety is good so i&#x27;ll just work with this for the time being.</li>
    <li> Love the colors love the long lasting bit when it arrived a whole row of colors was crushed and broken :c</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a natural palette that was on the affordable side but still of good quality and I definitely found it in this one! I have seen previous comments about the swatches being broken but that was not teh case for mine. I&#x27;ve even dropped mine on the sink and they all stayed intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 full stars because I haven&#x27;t tried any MAC products so I can&#x27;t really compare it to that. But I am COMPLETELY SATISFIED with this product. I absolutely love, love, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did see a review that said something about all of the lighter swatches appearing as the same color when applied. I didn&#x27;t really see that happen with my application of any of the lighter shades. I am Korean so I have a more olive skin tone but even in the winter when I am pretty pale, I could see the difference between each white, off-white, beige, etc swatch. It&#x27;s a bit subtle but nevertheless there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think that this palette is a great product for how many swatches you get and for the price you pay! I also got the Shany 24 brush set. This set is also a steal! :)</li>
    <li> Large compact very small palettes that crumble very easily. Would not order additional palettes. Better off buying less colors with bigger palettes</li>
    <li> the colors differ a little bit but i still love it. the colors are super pigmented, more then any other eye shadow ive eve ever seen, i was mostly wanting it for the purples but unfortunately they arent as purple as pictured... say that five times fast. anyway its still worth purchasing and i still use it allot. and u cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> I am an honest Youtube Reviewer who normally received products from the company, however, I purchased the 88 Nude Palette with funds from my own pocket, and loved the product SO MUCH that I wanted to do a review about it. These eyeshadow are so velvety soft and richly pigments. Well worth the $16.99, and super fast shipping.     Here is the video review on Youtube!    [...]</li>
    <li> It arrived in great shape. Each shadow is about the size of a dime and it comes with two applicators. The lid has a mirror in it, but the lid does not stay open on it&#x27;s own. The colors don&#x27;t show up as much as I had hoped. I was expecting something more along the lines of The Naked Palette from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, which I prefer.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PALETTE!! I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE COASTAL SCENTS 28 NEUTRAL PALETTE AND I MUST SAY THIS PALETTE IS 1000% BETTER THAN THAT PALETTE!!! MORE PIGMENTED, MORE COLORS, DIFFERENT FINISHES, AND OVER ALL AFFORDABLE!! I WOULD MOST DEFINTELY RECOMMEND THIS PALETTE, GREAT FOR ALL SKIN TONES IN MY OOPINION!! I WOULD BE PURCHASING AGAIN FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR A FRIEND!! SHANY COSMETICS WILL ALWAYS BE FIRST CHOICE IN MY BOOK!! ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT YOU GUYS!!!</li>
    <li> I got this to play with some new colors/styles and i love it! It makes putting makeup on in the morning more fun!&lt;br /&gt;Some of the colors are a bit darker than I would have liked but it is great for smokey eyes.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these eye shadows and love the color palette.  Only comes with two brushes.  I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> The quality of the shadows are great and they&#x27;re so pigmented. The only downfall of this product was the fact that my black shadow was broken and somehow ended up all over the outside of the pallet. Such a mess! It was really hard to clean up and I was disappointed. But once it was clean, everything was all good.</li>
    <li> I like this well enough. However I have dark skin so a lot of these colors not being as vibrant as the picture makes it disappointing. I put it as &amp;#34;as expected&amp;#34; because I have become jaded from the lack of vibrancy in colors of makeup. Still, I like the pallet and a good portion of the colors in it. The covering with mirror has broken for me and the case really isn&#x27;t resilient. With primer(general makeup primer that I just apply to my eyelids) I&#x27;m able to pull a little more vibrancy out of the eyeshadow. Considering that I wear makeup once in a blue moon, Its a good product for me.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price. Only one shadow had a small crack due to shipping, and I personally didn&#x27;t mind much. Highly pigmented. I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love this palette all the shades are awesome this is a gift for my mom but will definitely buy one for my self.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on the perfect color palette and am quite pleased with my purchase. I watched a YouTube review on this product where the reviewer identified all the dupes in this palette for both urban decay&#x27;s naked &amp; naked 2 palettes and since I&#x27;d been contemplating purchasing both of those palettes, I figured this was the better deal for quantity, quality, &amp; price.  Overall the product has sustained all my expectations.  I love all the shades of purple that this palette offers.  I am a huge fan of using plums for a smokey eye effect and this palette offers more of these shades than any other palettes I&#x27;ve researched.  I went into this purchase knowing what colors I didn&#x27;t intend on using, however after receiving this product and seeing it in person, I am reconsidering some of the shades and will try them out.  The eyeshadows are highly pigmented and apply smoothly with an eye lid primer.  Great variety of mattes and shimmers.</li>
    <li> I am still blown away about how well this eyeshadow holds all day with a good primer. I&#x27;m quite the make up hoarder and I have bought many of expensive brands from Sephora..but Shany blows them out of the water. At the end of the day, with a make up remover cloth it wipes right off cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are bright, highly pigmented and I&#x27;ve been doing some fun looks with this. I am sharing this with all my make up geek friends!</li>
    <li> Overall I am pretty pleased with this product. To start off, everything was shipped a.s.a.p. which was awesome, it actually came before it was supposed to;when I opened it everything was in great condition and packaged very nicely. I&#x27;m super pleased with the color range, everything from natural to dramatic. They seem to go on quite nice, color shows up well and doesn&#x27;t rub off easily. I expected there to be a bit more of each color, but for 88 colors at pretty much $15 dollars I&#x27;m still ecstatic!&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, good deal for a good price! Well done!</li>
    <li> Positive:&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly - triple wrapped&lt;br /&gt;Nice case&lt;br /&gt;88 colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;Even though it was wrapped in 3 things of bubble wrap; the case (which is black) was covered in black powder.&lt;br /&gt;Powder is super soft - flakes easy. Doesn&#x27;t spread on the eye lid very well because of the softness.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even think about getting powder in the wrong spot -- it is a challenge to get it off (even a speck). Smudges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst $15 I&#x27;ve ever spent - Now I have a palette of 88 eye shadows that I wouldn&#x27;t even give to my worst enemy. Trash :-(</li>
    <li> I really liked the colors and pigmentation of this palette. It has all the colors i wanted in tones of pink,brown and smoky. Few of them are shimmer and few are matte, so i can mix and match according to my day or party look. The price is good too!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 4 start instead of 5 only because when i received this order, 1 of the black colors was all broken and was spread on other colors and the outside of palette too. My hands were all messy when i opened the palette and had to clean that color from other colors too.&lt;br /&gt;Rest all, it was a really nice purchase.</li>
    <li> MY FIRST COMMENT that I would like to make about this palette is that it wasn&#x27;t broken when amazon shipped it to me, like I thought it would be! :) It had so much bubble wrap on it, that I had to cut it off. Thankfully it was well-packaged. The shadows were in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These eyeshadows are super pigmented. They are arranged in rows of colors, such as black/whites &amp; purples/browns, and light brown/reds. All of these eyeshadows could create either a dramatic or nude everyday look, depending on what you&#x27;re going for. There&#x27;s all kinds of looks you could do with this palette! I really enjoy the shadows, with, or without a primer. These are not \\&quot;Chalky\\&quot;, but pigmented, and you only need a little bit for dramatic color. The eyeshadows in the pan are not that huge, but they don&#x27;t need to be, considering you probably won&#x27;t use all of them, since they are super pigmented. There are matte and shimmer eyeshadows in this kit, and plenty of different dark/light colors to play around with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best values I&#x27;ve come across, make-up wise. I had read reviews on it, and decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m very glad that I did! Now I have an endless number of looks I can create..I&#x27;ve been using the palette everyday for a week now, and I feel free to get a little \\&quot;creative\\&quot; when I&#x27;m applying everyday. Such a great value, and service. I definitely will purchase more products from this brand. The palette is also compact and super cute! You should give it a try. Especially if you&#x27;re like me, and you want to play around with makeup, but you can&#x27;t afford a million different products. This is the only one that you&#x27;ll need. : )</li>
    <li> This was my 1st time ordering Shany brand eye shadow before. While i was not impressed with Shany&#x27;s make up brush set that i purchased last time; this eyeshadow is a different story. I have been using it for a good many months now and i&#x27;m still very impressed at how good the quality is, and how affordable it is. I have tried BH Cosmetics before, which i thought was ok for the price - comparable with this Shany. BUT, this Shany eyeshadow is totally in different quality! It is comparable to expensive brand eyeshadow like Urban Decay that i also have. I would totally recommend it. It&#x27;s very pigmented; the ones that have shimmer, they are my favorites; all are very soft and easy to blend. If you&#x27;re debating to get this or not; i would say, BUY it!</li>
    <li> I was waiting for this item to arrive, colors are so nice and worm, there are every day colors and special occasions colors. So soft on the skin</li>
    <li> Bought this for my makeup-loving sister for her birthday gift, and she says the quality is great. She loves the color palette, and the eye shadows look great on her. Great price.</li>
    <li> These colors are lovely and suit for my skin color. Its so natural and good for day make up either night.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the MAC 88 what the heck? it came as Shany! though the product has beautiful color&#x27;s! when I got this product it was messed up! the black shadow ran on all the other color&#x27;s! How do I return this? ASAP PLEASE!!!! very upset. I have decided to KEEP this product.</li>
    <li> love it, great pigmentation</li>
    <li> I love this palette of eye shadows. I chose this one because I prefer the earth tones over the blues, purples, etc. Well worth the money with all of the colors you get with this.</li>
    <li> I got this item  today in great shape nothing was not broken !!!! loveee ittttt  the colours are natural and beautiful</li>
    <li> I use practically all of the colors on this pallet!! I only use earth tone colors for makeup so this was the best thing I could have ever bought</li>
    <li> Excellent, i love my new eye shadow!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews it rec&#x27;d.  The delivery was fast.  The packaging was air tight.  The product itself, wonderful.  The colors are very pretty and very easy to apply and blends easily.  I will definately buy more from the Shany line.</li>
    <li> i like this palette! the shipping was right on time! and i love the colors!!! and the way it applies on the eyes defiantly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift and they loved it. Packed nice and look good. Very nice gift I would get one for myself.</li>
    <li> A must have for ladies these colours are neutral and flexible. You can play them down or create gorgeous smooky eye effect for any occassion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve try this brsnd before but the kit that I order came with the black eyeshadow complety smash and all over yhe rest no happy but too busy to srnd back</li>
    <li> Love!!! Very pigmented and the price does not equate to the quality. A must have for your collection! Def purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Love all the colors, it will be perfect for travel. Just suggest more applicators to be included as the set only comes with two.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PALLET. The colors are very pigmented and they don&#x27;t slide off your face (just make sure to use a primer)</li>
    <li> I love nude eye looks for every day... the bold colors are fun but not for my work! This palette has neutral colors all in one place.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any more happy with this product!! The price is amazing and the item even better. The size of each eyeshadow is a little smaller then what I expected, but with 88 different colors to use, I think it&#x27;s still a good amount of makeup. The colors are awesome, some shimmer and some not. I will definitely continue to buy MORE Shany  products!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It came perfect time. Also no broken colors . The colors were so bright and shimmer. It&#x27;s worth buying and a great price.</li>
    <li> This makeup palette is very beautiful and the product itself came in the mail in perfect condition. It was packaged and protected very well. The only thing that i didn&#x27;t really like about this product is that the colors fade and bleed throughout the day (i work out and i also go to school). Maybe i just need a better primer. But overall, i would suggest this product to anyone on a budget like me. It&#x27;s also really good for those who aren&#x27;t experts! I would recommend buying really good eye shadow brushes with this.</li>
    <li> I do like the colors and they are very vibrant. My only complaint is it&#x27;s not as big as I thought it was. I thought for $30 I would be getting a bit bigger case with bigger eye shadows. The quality is nice and the colors look like picture just be aware that it&#x27;s kinda small.</li>
    <li> I got this product and yes this is a great one! I used it occasionally and I can recommend this to you!</li>
    <li> I bought this last year it is o. Of the best . The pigment is so good stays on all day. Actually since I got it I dt bother with any other eyeshadow, I also have the 120 palette love it</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for Christmas and was almost enraged I got &amp;#34;cheap eyeshadow&amp;#34; from no doubt China as I have seen things in drug stores that look like this... I ALMOST gave it to my sister in law but tried it anyway.. I am so shocked at how I have come around for this PARTICULAR palette... its the best Ive ever had in my life!! I WISH I had this when I was in my 20s, with all that club going I was doing.. it has the most thoughtfully picked out colors.. and colors I thought were useless and a waste have served to be the most interesting thing about this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever arranged and put these colors together, and near each other, knew what they were doing!!! They are AN ARTISTE OF EPIC PROPORTIONS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also go on smoothly, last a long time.. and its just the WILD VARIETY that is astonishing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are FAR superior to the crap you get at Sephora for the outrageous rip off prices. I even showed it to them and they seemed uninterested, especially when I told them the price, then they seemed threatened. LOL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again and again... its a gorgeous collection of colors. I never thought Id ever have a use for BEIGE!! but its an eye appealing magnificent addition to the browns!!! Dear Gods!! This palette is one of the few things left in life that is a deal!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it has parabens. Oh well. Maybe we can convince the company to take that out?</li>
    <li> i received my kit today and let me tell you man i am so happy...this is the best makeup kit ever...upon receiving it i threw out the old ones i have so many colors to choose from plus the shades are so rich u dont need to apply more than once...a makeup kit like this i dont need another its the best! there isnt one fault i can find no not one...and im still smiling. i will definitely buy more products from this company, the packaging was awesome too nothing was out of place. shipping came in a timely manner as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Natural Fusion palette. I have two complaints. When the package arrived it was covered in black powder, which I found out was from the broken eyeshadow inside. Only two of the eyeshadows were broken (black and an orange shade) so it is not worth the hassle to return. Also, be aware that the colors may not completely match the ones advertised. The colors in my palette were similar to those in the picture, but were not exactly the same. Other than that, these eyeshadows are great for the price, decent quality for what you are paying for. I&#x27;m happy with them and will be using them as an occasional supplement to my higher quality makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African Amer. Amber Bronze tone (deeper in summer) and these colors def. work on my skin. Very beautiful I&#x27;m still learning so I&#x27;m not rating it 5 stars still a wonderful purchase for the price  Colors are dime size but you don&#x27;t need much for it to show .. ENJOY!</li>
    <li> Great gift for my friend. She loved it and still uses it, when it has been over a year. This product will last.</li>
    <li> I like the product and the colors but I keep having to put the shadows back in their slots as they fall out very easily.  I may need to hot glue them down but I&#x27;m not sure how that will affect the color/powder.</li>
    <li> I received my Shany eyeshadow palette extremely fast! It was in tact in a regular cute little box. No eye shadows were broken and they all looked beautiful upon opening. There is a nice variety in my opinion. Only negatives are that the eyeshadow amounts are tiny so you will run out of your favorite eyeshadow quickly, and also some of them show up very similar on fair skin, I am Hispanic with very fair skin and there were 3-4 of the lighter shades that looked exactly the same in me even though they appeared different in the palette. Over all I&#x27;m happy with the product and am looking forward to playing around with the colors more!</li>
    <li> Half the colors in here are the SAME, and it is not a very nice quality. I does come in handy for halloween makeup, since that is all I can use the other half of the colors for. Skip it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to learn more about makeup and this product is great to mess around with. Happy with the purchase, there was no problem with it upon opening it like some other customers had (and that was something I was mildly concerned about.)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas.  The colors are great but one of the colors was completely crushed and bled in to the other colors around it.  It was a pain to clean up.  The quality is great and I received it super fast but I was a little frustrated with the one crushed eye shadow.</li>
    <li> If you want to sample a lot of different colors for a fair price, this is for you. It goes on a lot better than the Elf ones I bought, but they are really little and you may not even end up using all of them.</li>
    <li> First of all, beautiful case, it looks similar to a laptop, ha ha. The product has an excellent variety of shades, no need to buy any more for me for a while! It comes with two eye shadow sponges, but shhh... as we all know those are just for the decoration haha. Other then that, great product, I&#x27;d highly reccommend it.</li>
    <li> The colors are great. The makeup stays and all but the package came to me very dirty. One of the shadows was broken and had messed up the case but besides that, great colors.</li>
    <li> Greatest thing I&#x27;ve bought in a long time! I love this set! It has every color I could want and then some. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Package arrived intact- which is always important. It was double wrapped as well as in its original box. Colors are very true and well pigmented- easy to blend as well. This palette also includes 2 double ended applicators- which are okay- I prefer to use brushes by the same company for precision (wonderful brushes by the way). I would recommend this to anyone who needs or wants a well rounded earthy palette. Very nice indeed.</li>
    <li> I bought this palette because I am starting to get into makeup and wanted a natural everyday look. I also used this for prom and it looked really fantastic! With the varying shades of color, it was able to help create a smokey, yet subtle look. Although, a con that really bothers me is that the mirror doesn&#x27;t holds up on its own. You have to either hold the mirror upright or lay it back against some kind of wall. I didn&#x27;t do this because it was kind of frustrating to bend down to look in the mirror. So, the mirror inside is kind of pointless for me. Anyways, I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a natural everyday look and there are so many colors to choose from too! Trust me, the many shades of browns, pinks, purples, black, etc hardly looks the same!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS, AND THE PRICE IS GOOD, HAPPY COSTUMER HERE</li>
    <li> she has more colors then her mother does in her selection. Is very satisfied with the product, it does NOT cause any blemishes not skin irritations.</li>
    <li> Nice color palette. I use the neutral colors the most, and I&#x27;ve been pleased with how they stay on.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love my palette..... beautiful colors, nice size I will be purchasing more shany products from amazon coming up soon.</li>
    <li> This is good product but if it falls the makeup breaks to easily. I still recommend it because of the different colors</li>
    <li> the shipping was quick but when I opened it all the eyeshadow was broken imm very disappointed because ive heaerd such good things about this product</li>
    <li> So last week I ordered a BHCosmetics 120 eyeshadow pallete and was sooooooooooo happy when I saw it and realized it looked better in person then on the screen. I was soooo juiced about it and then I came across this Shany Cosmetics 88 eyeshadow pallete and dispite one really bad review i took my chances... The colors looked amazing and i just loved the natural feel of it. N E Who, I just recieved it today and I promise you not only was the pallete PERFECT but it was wrapped and boxed so nicely. NOT ONE SINGLE EYESHADOW came to me broke. It looked PERFECT!!!!!! I can&#x27;t figure n e other word to describe it...LOL&lt;br /&gt;With my BHPallete tho it was beautiful, 2 colors had been broken... :( I was slightly disappointed but got over it quickly when I saw it was 2 colors I didn&#x27;t care to much for n e ways! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im in love with this Shany pallete, its got wonderful pigments! and I would definitely recommend this to whoever is interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that i have tried 2 different brands of palletes, my next stop with be the Coastal Scents Palletes! :D</li>
    <li> I love eye make up and get several compliments on my eyes. This is the second Shany palette I&#x27;ve ordered and I love them both</li>
    <li> I am just a beginner at blending and using eye shadows, so keep that in mind. I purchased this palette a month ago and its just okay. I read many of the reviews and had high expectations. I expected great pigmentation and easy blending. I like most of the color choices. There&#x27;s a nice, even amount of matte and shimmery shadows to choose from. I discovered that I had much better pigmentation when I used a primer, the colors came out much more true to how they look in the palette. However, I have had a very hard time blending the shadows out nicely. I&#x27;m not sure if its the shadows themselves, if its the primer I use (NYX HD Eye Shadow Base) or if its the brushes I use (Shany 24 count brushes with leather pouch). I was hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t have to invest in a more expensive palette, but I might just do that for special occasions. The shadows are dime size, but they seem like they would last quite awhile. When I use a primer, I don&#x27;t have to use much eye shadow so that may be something you would want to buy if you already haven&#x27;t. I would recommend this for wearing to school or work, somewhere not all that exciting. But if you&#x27;re looking for something that will really help you create a flawless look, I would keep looking. Shipping was decently fast also.</li>
    <li> i ordered this eyeshadow palette on july 5th. it didn&#x27;t get to me until august 3rd.  looks like it&#x27;s been wrapped by a 3 year-old boy. AND the mirror inside was completely SHATTERED, a thousand sharp mirror pieces fell out as i opened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE WORST PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE ON AMAZON (and believe me, i shop here a lot)</li>
    <li> I bought this palette for myself knowing how great SHANY&#x27;s eye makeup is. I have blue/green eyes/warm skintone, and the colours being mostly shades of brown, copper, bronze, tan, and burgundy, every single colour makes my eyes POP!!! No matter whether my hair is teal, pink, blood red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also cannot state enough how much money you will save by buying this or any of the other SHANY palettes. Good quality drugstore quads are usually around $7, so you do the math. What lacks in quantity of each shade is something you will never even notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The matte colours are a bit more firm than the pealesque shades, but it is definitely not anything to worry over.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who loves variety and has taste, as with any other SHANY palette. I myself own 11 for both work and play, and no matter who I&#x27;m working with, using these palettes I can create any look I need or want to. This particular palette works for corporate jobs, the night club, and the underground.&lt;br /&gt;I STRONGLY recommend this palette as a gift to anyone who wears makeup on a regular basis, and any of the other ones as gifts to teens and anyone who likes variety in their look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use several blending techniques, and while the matte colours are a tiny bit more complicated to use, as long as you use primer and then the darkest shade you will be using on the eyelid, then gradiate upwards and add the other colours in, and then re-apply the darkest shade then smudge-blend, you will have a long-lasting and (using the natural shades) classy look that is to be unrivaled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend that I bought some SHANY makeup brushes for has hazel-green eyes and usually uses a particular shade of light purple and rarely strays from her normal makeup routine let me give her a makeover using this palette and she was amazed, asked to look at it, and now wants me to order one for her. And her sister sells Mary Kay. SHANY WILL ALWAYS BE THE WINNER.</li>
    <li> The product is good but the box came broken. A good part of the eyeshadows were jumping out.</li>
    <li> This palette is great instead of fumbling with a bunch of small compact cases. Goes on nice with a eye shadow brush.</li>
    <li> my 2nd palette by this company, great colors</li>
    <li> I really love the colors but the packaging was awful, it seemed like someone had opened it and tried some of the colors. when I opened the packaging all of the black eye shadow spilled over on top of the palette and my carpet. I tried to clean it as best as I could. The black color was smashed and the other browns looked like someone had been using them and mixing the colors. not what I expected at all.I&#x27;ve bought other products from shany and never had this problem til now.last purchase I will make of shany cosmetics!</li>
    <li> I love this set I would definitely get another one if I run out</li>
    <li> Love the shades, wish I had more color options. Will have to buy another pallet. This has a lot of neutrals and under, highlighting tones. Seems to stay well throughout the day!</li>
    <li> this is the first of this type I have purchased.  The colors are natural and look good on me.  It will last a long time.</li>
    <li> All the warm colors that I had been searching for are finally here in one palette. I absolutely it! Don&#x27;t miss out on this deal.</li>
    <li> Love these shadows! They last a long time with an eye primer! Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my eyeshadow palette. Instead of having to buy a bunch of different colors it gave me the option of having a bunch of colors all in one thing.</li>
    <li> The colors stay on all day and is very easy to blend. You definitely need primer first though.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shades and even though they are dime-sized they are quality shades of makeup</li>
    <li> So pissed! I bought this expecting to receive the SHANY natural eye palette but no! I receive a CHEAP, WORTHLESS palette! This is not what I ordered! At all!</li>
    <li> So I was excited to receive this shipment  I do have many small quad eyeshadows, however I was looking for one pallette that gives me a lot of options all in one  And to be honest this is good quality  first of all the color on pallete gets transferred on to skin as it is   You dont have to apply too much of it and no need for later maintenance  this collection is good for both nude and night out looks  I recommend this product</li>
    <li> This palette is wonderful. I ordered this palette for me since i already had ordered the 180 palette of bright neon eyeshadows but also wanted nice natural colors and this palette is it. The colors are natural colors but have shimmer to it and they are beautiful. My sister came over to my house and loved the palette so much that she took it lol so i just ordered a second one for me.</li>
    <li> Palette is gorgeous. ahhhh now I just need to figure out how the heck to use it! but hey that&#x27;s the fun part. good buy!</li>
    <li> Love, love this palette. Colors are beautiful and very pigmented and last all day if you prime ur eyes prior to applying shadow... Would defenetely recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product. I recommend it to anybody. The nutral pallete has all great shaded of brown colors which I use more. I will definitely be ordering more as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow palette is very well pigmented, although when it arrived two of the shadows were broken. But for the price it is an amazing deal!</li>
    <li> I gave this product a 5 star because I really love the product. They have a wide variety of natural and a great combination of shimmer and matte. The product goes great on my skin and stays put for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 20, barely beginning to experiment with make up and makeup shadows. This product will not go wrong for any beginners or professional!</li>
    <li> Decent eyeshadow quality given the price!</li>
    <li> This is not authentic shany. Shany is US made, this pallette came from China and some of the shadows arrived broken and pulverized. And the Shany label was no where to be seen. However, the colors are nice and I will use it, but I don&#x27;t recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Great palette!~  And love that Shany has cruelty-free products!~ Thank you for a great product!~</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail and I love it. The colors are great, it was packaged well, and it stays on great with a primer!</li>
    <li> This pallete is amazing! As 17 years old girl that like to just play around with makeup it&#x27;s perfect! But it&#x27;s also has great day to day colors that I can see myself wearing allllll the time!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re considering purchasing the Naked palettes, THINK AGAIN. I was desperate for an alternative to Urban Decay&#x27;s 50 dollar palettes, and after reading the reviews on this product, I thought it was  worth a shot. Of course, I was a little skeptical, but this product is AMAZING. The colors are highly pigmented, but work best with eye shadow primer (as with almost any eye shadow). Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. I completely recommend this product, especially to those who don&#x27;t need name-brand cosmetics. A++++</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great palette!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very useful for smokey eyes &amp; they have good pigmintation.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this palette.&lt;br /&gt;Except that the shipping wasnt so great. Some of the colors had dust around it, like if it fell out.</li>
    <li> This palette is awesome. I love the colors and they&#x27;re great to blend together. It just like coastal scents but cheaper.</li>
    <li> Black hands.  Before I got the pallete open my hands were black as were my clothes and opal ring.  Long story short soap got the black off my hands.  Not sure about the clothes.  Will work on the opal ring tomorrow in the daylight or take to a jeweler.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I mistakenly thought the product was made in the USA.  Now I see it is China.  Really makes me wonder about the safety of the product.  Not sure whether I will use.  However, very intersting and neutral colors.  Just upset at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;12-20  I&#x27;ve used it several times.  Fun to play with all the colors.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as a lot of eye shadows. But hey what do you expect.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to make this 3 stars.  but it didn&#x27;t take.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd time i get a Shany eyeshadow palette and im sooo in love with them!!!i love the low prices because not everyone (me) has alot of money to afford a $50 pallete that only has like 10 colors.As for Shany,they&#x27;re cheap and they give you lots of variety to choose from!!! instead of waisting 100&#x27;s of $$ buying MAC, Sephora, or etc,ima buy more &amp; more SHANY!!!SHany, you should sell more makeup and ill be your #1 customer!â™¥â™¥â™¥</li>
    <li> This Palette was just what I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They took the time to bubble wrap the crap out of it..lol...but still the black was all over the inside:(...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still give them a 5 star because the colors are fab and they left a cute note inside that made me feel like a special person!!lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will def be ordering from them in the future</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great product. The pigment quality is better than I expected and isn&#x27;t at all cakey going on. I&#x27;d compare it to purchasing a palette of NYX eyeshadow - not the very top of the line but it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, either.</li>
    <li> Works great if a good eyeshadow base is on the eyelids really well! Goes on smooth and I believe anyone should have this palette!</li>
    <li> Love the color palette and consistancy of the various colors, great for blending.  The color does not fade and is long lasting.</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited to get the eyeshadow pallet. The colors are gorgeous and the pigmintation is great.. Is is essentially a day to night palatte (if you are like me no super dooper smokey eye but darker browns and some metalics to jazz it up) overall I liked it so much I am buying one for a friend. Great product!</li>
    <li> ordered this on the 15th and didnt expect to get it until after the 20th, but i was very surprised and excited when it came on the 17th. love the wide range of colors, theyre all very natural and not too much or too bright. they are very pigmented but the blacks are more of a gray, which is fine. i had orginally considered buying the urban decay naked 2 palette but im glad i didnt, this one has a lot of the same and similar colors and for a much better price</li>
    <li> I love the color variety and the eyeshadow usually doesn&#x27;t crease, although I use a primer. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the eyeshadow has parabens in it, so I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> good value but seems to have paraben.  If you are okay with that, then good value</li>
    <li> This pallete is amazing, so many colours all really well pigmented, products stays on well although they are really small you do get alot of colours, most colours have a shade thats a tiny bit lighter so if you do run out of one there is a 98% copy of it in the pallete</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this palette! I tried it out today and it looked awesome. The eye shadows were very pigmented, but I suggest using a primer for the best look. The middle row, which has blacks, greys, and whites, which is perfect for smokey eyes. I have brown eyes and brown hair and most of the colors look great. I highly suggest this eye shadow for someone looking for someone looking to have a natural look some days and more dramatic, but still light, other days. The only problem I had was that I dropped my eyeshadow and the lid broke, but that is pretty much my fault. All in all, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> These colors are a must especially for everyday wear! The large assortment of colors helps expand your choices of what to wear. Experiment with all the natural colors!</li>
    <li> 88 beautiful color, great mix and matching for any-time look for the day. It is inexpensive including a mirror and 2 sponge applicator.</li>
    <li> ThE nude pallet is beautiful amazing colors some shimmery and some Matt but you can creat beautiful looks with this pallet</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I wanted more variety for a reasonable price, and the reviews overall were pretty good.  The company promptly processed and shipped my order. When this arrived I was very excited to try it out! Well, I have been using this for a little over a week now...&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply, goes on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;Color lasts and doesn&#x27;t fade or smudge throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;All of the light shades look white when applied.  They look to have a colored tint in the container but there is no color to them once applied.&lt;br /&gt;All of the darker shades look dark gray once applied.  It looked like I had a beautiful assortment of colors to choose from, but once on the skin, just...dark gray.&lt;br /&gt;So of course, what do you know, all of the darkest shades appear..you guessed it, black!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thoroughly disappointed in thos purchase!  I hope to soon find a different make up company to try out as I wouldn&#x27;t order any more eyeshadow from this company again out of fear of disappointment.  In times like these most of us can&#x27;t afford to waste money and considering thst essentially all I got here was 3 colors, it was a waste.  I could have easily gotten 3 colors locally for $4.</li>
    <li> muy buen producto a muy buen precio.&lt;br /&gt;muy buen producto a muy buen precio.&lt;br /&gt;muy buen producto a muy buen precio&lt;br /&gt;c</li>
    <li> This was my first Shany purchase... wow!!! The colors are beautiful and apply smoothly and blend easily without much fallout. I have also ordered the shimmer pallette and the bright pallette....can&#x27;t wait to experiment with different color combinations!</li>
    <li> I received this product, and when I opened it up the case was all broken and it will not shut.  Very cheap eye shadow brushes, do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great pigment and you can wear these colours out any time of day and night. Great choice to choose from and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> i love this palette!!! i also got some lipsticks and other products from them. this palette is sooo pigmented and just so many colors!!! its great for all eye colors!! i love it!! it was packaged in bubblewrap and plastic and it took a while to get to my house but i live in ny and it ships from tx so i dont care but overall i love this company!!</li>
    <li> I really love this palette. There are so many gorgeous colors to choose from, and its so convenient for any event. The best thing is that it&#x27;s great for long-time wear, it doesn&#x27;t clump up in the crease of your eyelid after hours of wear as some of my eyeshadow does. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she was so happy with it. Has every color she wanted. The colors are about the size of a dime but it still seems to be plenty.</li>
    <li> The wells are small than I thought, but it&#x27;s not so bad because they are super pigmented! A little goes a long way. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting such good quality but the reviews were right! None of them were broken (till I got my hands on it, accidentally stuck the end of a brush into one!), the case was clean and very well packaged. I will definitely buy more products from SHANY</li>
    <li> I bought this palette and LOVE all the colors. None of them were broken either, which was a relief after buying online. One thing I&#x27;m not so sure about--did anyone else have issues with the case/mirror? Is the mirror part supposed to stand up? Mine falls right down flat, and I can&#x27;t figure out how to make it stand up except for leaning it against something. That&#x27;s the only reason I give this four stars so far.</li>
    <li> I am Black and Asian, and I&#x27;m lighter skinned for a Black person and darker skinned for an Asian. The color selection is great for me. The two attached eyeshadow applicators don&#x27;t stick well to the top of the case, once removed. But that&#x27;s a small setback, and the case still closes when they aren&#x27;t in their proper place.</li>
    <li> Well the colors are really nice, the pigment is very strong. There&#x27;s a lot of shades to choose from. very natural colors, will recommend it! Only issue was one shadow pallet was broken but still worth it :) 4 stars!</li>
    <li> love this set! the colors are awesome and very vibrant. the case is very sturdy and it was packaged well.</li>
    <li> On my computer monitor, the colors appeared too light and too vivid, but I trusted the good reviews and ordered anyway - and am so glad that I did. Each shadow is only about as big as a dime, but there are SO MANY of them. The majority are shimmery, many are matte, a few are a little glittery. Many gorgeous, muted purple-to-plum shades that are so flattering to green eyes. There are a few pinkish and bluish-grey shadows that I&#x27;ll never use but, over all, I love the set.</li>
    <li> The colors in this palette have amazing pigments. They come on very strong and vibrant and they stay on through out the day. They are a little small, however there are many choices to pick from. Great buy.</li>
    <li> these colors are really pretty and are perfect for a glam meets natural kind  of makeup look it the slight shimmer they have to them.</li>
    <li> This Collection has colors for all skin tones.  It has a combination of matte and shimmer colors.  All of the colors appear to blend well. This will let you combine for many diferent looks. This collection is great if you like the smokey eye look in different colorings.  I myself use this one for the smokey eye looks because of the amount of great dark colors it has in it.  I would tell any woman to get this collection, they will not be disappointed with it. Remember the colors are highly pigmented so a little goes a long ways.  The colors also last a long time. A really great collection.  Linda W.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny, came in great condition love the colors. what u see is what u get the colors are amazing. Works great, shipped fast, no damage &amp; good packaging. :D</li>
    <li> SHANY is known for being a bargain makeup company with great deals on lot assortments of product, and their strongest products are definitely their eyeshadow palettes.  The Natural Fusion palette is a perfect basic for people who like to do a smoky eye, both the traditional black/gray or variations with a touch of color, as well as creating bronze/copper looks with shades of plum and wine.  This palette isn&#x27;t as versatile as some of their others, but it was made more for a couple specific types of looks rather than experimenting with a wide variety of vivid shades.  If you&#x27;ve wanted to try out a SHANY palette but have been putting it off because you were afraid you wouldn&#x27;t use their rainbow of shades, this is definitely a good starting palette for you as their are enough neutrals to create softer daytime looks and a few darker, richer colors to spice it up for nighttime looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their shadows are pressed powder, but have a creamy texture when you&#x27;re applying them that is never chalky and helps them stay in place.  I still recommend using a base (like the NYX white base) and probably a primer to keep them from creasing or flaking and to make the colors more vivid, but this is definitely a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I got this particular pallet because the combination of matte and shimmer and i really liked the colors. Most were a neutral tone but there were a few that looked like they had purple and pink tones. when I received the pallet I was very disappointed to see all browns no purples or pink tones at all. I ended up getting a different SHANY pallet with the right colors and I absolutely love it, so its not the makeup that I give a bad rating to.</li>
    <li> i love these eyeshadows so many colors great quality alot of shimmer lasts all day with primer. perfect for giftðŸ˜€</li>
    <li> Other than looking for a bigger variety of colors (the left side are a lot of orange shades and the right are pinks), the shadows stay throughout the day and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> I love this set.  It&#x27;s so much fun to be able to play around with different colors to acquire different looks.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Received my package very quickly, and everything was intact. The colors are not as bright as in the picture but I haven&#x27;t tried them yet; so I&#x27;ll edit my review when I do.</li>
    <li> I would order this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice packaging, nothing broken or missing, no mess&lt;br /&gt;Variety of colors, each high quality, some shimmery and some not&lt;br /&gt;Comes with nice mirror inside and two applicators&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Mine don&#x27;t seem quite as bright as they look in the picture&lt;br /&gt;Sort of a weird smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it too much, it might just be the plastic</li>
    <li> you get a lot for your money here. the colors are awesome, and look great on. If you want a good set of eyeshadows then this is for you</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this - so excited to open the box - but...surprise surprise! it was a mess! my hands turned black as soon as I took the makeup out of the package - my carpet - my hands  -a mess. Trash! Literally trash! Talked to Amazon - sent a new one - not as bad, but  colors and mostly black ones...a mess again! Sending this back! Disappointed. The colors that are intact look pretty though!</li>
    <li> ladies these colors are soo pretty even better when you try it on i love makeup and this palette save me money and time all you need for a natural or dramatic looks in one</li>
    <li> After reading many good reviews I decided to finally buy this product. I normally buy covergirl, maybelline and so forth but really wanted the variety. I love the fall, coffee colors for my fair skin. The black eyeshadow was broken (which was weird because it&#x27;s the one directly in the center, and the only one that came broken) so when I opened the box there was black everywhere. (easy clean up, but a little frustrating)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadow it self does last well, and stays on for a while. Just for some reason I&#x27;m not super in love with this kit but it does do the job. Probably will buy from again because it&#x27;s a nice price for the actual palette and not cheap in quality.</li>
    <li> This palette is perfect if you want a lot of natural toned colors. I love pulling this one out for when I feel like wearing eye shadow but I want it to be subtle. These shadows are pretty good with pigmentation, this was definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> Has great texture and the pigment is very nice. Like the look of the case but would like if there was more of a lip for fingers to open it.</li>
    <li> I love this palette ! ! !  The colors are so BEAUtIFUL. I will be ordering more from Shany :)</li>
    <li> This palette is awesome :) the colors are so vibrant and they last all day. They don&#x27;t fade throughout the day like other brands I have used.</li>
    <li> Simple looks with great eyeshadow the colors were great and packaging very safe so they do not break such a beautiful variety. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> I received my eye palette very quickly. This palette has beautiful soft colors and aren&#x27;t too loud. They blend well and look great. I will be ordering again!!!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the quality and colors in this palette.  This was my first time buying SHANY products so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  The colors are gorgeous for everyday where.  I am having so much fun with them!  A great buy!</li>
    <li> Love the colors. came all intake and in great shape. blinds well and fells light on the eyes</li>
    <li> beautiful colors as pictured and nothing damaged!</li>
    <li> Its great im trying wveey shade. Now i dont have to buy anymore eyeshadow. Loving it!!!! I usually only where one shade but now i have options</li>
    <li> I love the array of colors! It is a very versatile palette as well as a high quality product. The price makes it even better!</li>
    <li> As everyone has said, the black pallet got over Everything. Including my hands, pallet and entire house. Two of the colors also were dislodged from their places. The colors themselves look decent but the product packaging is terrible.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the colors and It is the first eye-shadow palette Ive ever purchased. The quality is great and it is a very reasonable price. It came on time and no cracked eye-shadows when I opened it. I have not tried it, I am planning on doing so in August. I&#x27;ll add on to this review once i try it and tell you guys how it worked out(: Overall, I am very excited and happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> it was so lovely!!! very helpful to my makeup course.</li>
    <li> Great eyeshadow palette! I can only recommend it. Great variety of intense, well pigmented and long lasting eyeshadows. Perfect for everyday life. I usually put them on in the morning before work and it lasts until the evening without having to freshen up. Go for it!</li>
    <li> Its perfect! I deffinately recommend! Not only was not a single one broken but it is also highly pigmented so it will last me a little while! It compliments my eyes and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> It came broke, I still was able to use a few of the eye shadows , it such a mess. I&#x27;m very displeased</li>
    <li> Beautiful pallette. Works best if I put a liquid foundation/primer on my lids and then &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; the shadow on. If you try to brush it on without primer it will be very subtle. If you pat it on top of primer it makes great smoky eye looks etc.</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get. The Colors are fantastic. For the price your getting way lot more. very satisfied. and its shipped well contianed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter and thought the makeup would  be poor quality because of the low price. I was wrong! It stays on as well as any higher priced brands, and the colors are gorgeous. I would buy this for myself!</li>
    <li> This is my second palette from this company, and it is as beautiful as the first! Packaged with care, all the awesome colors arrived unbroken, and it is going to make a wonderful gift for my daughter! For the price, this is an absolute no-brainer! Love it!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this palette! I don&#x27;t wear bright and crazy colors of eyeshadow, and most large pallets include too many colors I would never wear, but not this palette. I can easily wear every color in this set, and feel comfortable and confident! I stick to basic, natural and smoky eye looks, and this pallets is perfect for creating those looks with the shadows by themselves, or by mixing, matching and blending these great colors. I gave all of my other pallets away, because I finally found the one for me! The shadows are VERY highly pigmented too, so a little goes a long way, and they are amazingly good quality! Highly recommended for those who want a natural color palette! :)</li>
    <li> I like the fact that you get so many colors to choose from, and the colors are powders, but they have a buttery feel to them. They blend remarkably well, and they last really good on their own. I DO use Urban Decay Eye Potion Primer (the plain one) whenever I use powder eye shadows just to make them last longer, and these lasted all night through drinking. Strong pigmentation too! A little of the shadow goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This brand of makeup products is wonderful. I have a few mixed palettes and the colors are beautiful and long lasting. You can get bold colors, frosted colors or matte. They are all great.</li>
    <li> Those days when you want a relaxed look reach for this pallet, its neutral mix with warm mixed with cool and all the colors blend well together for the perfect mini smokey eye</li>
    <li> If your wanting to achieve that romantic neutral eye then this is the palette for you!! The colors are very long lasting and you can create so many different looks. Its worth every penny dont let this one pass you by!!![[ASIN:B005UKT9LG Shany Natural Fusion Eyeshadow Palette (88 Color Eyeshadow Palette, Nude Palette), 2.15 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> i love this eye shadow pallet but the only problem i had was when i recieved it the black shadow was broken and it was a little bit of a mess. still good tho and worth it i just love the colors :)</li>
    <li> So excited, my pallet came 3 days earlier than expected! It was packaged tightly in bubble wrap and all shadows came in one piece, no cracks or spills. I&#x27;ve just tried the browns and golds to see how the colors looked and I really like them. The pigment it great and they are super blendable. Can&#x27;t wait to play around with the colors some more. The applicators that come with the pallet are poor quality, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But otherwise, I love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this palette directly from Shany Cosmetics online, though it is available at a reasonable price through Amazon (with free shipping if Prime member).  I read a lot of reviews of Shany products and purchased this and other palettes by this company.  I am thoroughly impressed with the quality and pigmentation for the price.  Many YouTube makeup tutorials use more expensive lines, but found a few using Shany products.  Here are some of my main impressions. For your reference, I am very light skinned and 40-something.  This is for my personal use.  I am in no way a makeup artist, but am enjoying becoming one with my Shany products.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Highly pigmented--a little on  your brush for most shades goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Great variety: very neutral tones in browns, orange/peach, grays, and violets with highlighting shades. Shimmer and matte both go on great.Using the right brush, darker colors can be used as liner as well as contour shades.&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive--1 shade of MAC costs almost as much as a whole 88-shade palette.  Many will prefer MAC, but I can&#x27;t afford it on student loans.&lt;br /&gt;Blending---very nice complementary shades that blend nicely with an appropriate brush.  You can hardly mess up with the tones provided.&lt;br /&gt;No creasing/good staying power---I always use a shadow primer, so I don&#x27;t know how well the colors last without one, but with a primer, the colors stay on all day for me and do not crease.  I do have drier 40-something skin, so I am not sure about creasing with those with oily lids&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Come in a nice, shiny black plastic case with a beautiful gold-embossed logo that is easy to open but fastens shut&lt;br /&gt;Litte fall-out: Using a primer and eyeshadow brushes, I have had little problems with the color falling all over my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Environmentally aware:  Website states they use some recycled products in their packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pan size:  Pans are about the size of a dime.  However, there are so many colors and they are so pigmented, I am sure there is plenty there to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Palette size:  It is rather large and bulky.  Unless you carry a very big purse, transportation may be an issue if you are using this for your every day look.&lt;br /&gt;Origin:  Though they are shipped from the U.S., the package says \\&quot;made in China\\&quot;.  I am not sure exactly where the product is made.&lt;br /&gt;Fragile:  I haven&#x27;t dropped my palette or tried to transport it far, but some reviewers stated that when they dropped their palette, many colors broke.  Just be careful.&lt;br /&gt;Very neutral:  This palette is mostly browns, purples, oranges, greys, and highlight colors.  There is no green or blue (one brown has a green tone to it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I LOVE Shany&#x27;s shadow palettes.  I like the variety, the blendability, the pigmentation, and the price.  I have a sensitivity to colors with red, but my eyes have had no problems with any of the tints/dyes used. I have also tried BH cosmetics shadows, and they are very good also, but I prefer the texture of Shany. They are a smaller company and have been pleased with the customer service.  I ordered three palettes from them, they forgot to send me one of the palettes, so they shipped it out the next day.  Everything came perfectly bubble-wrapped in a box both times.  If you order $50 worth from the company, it is free shipping and they send you full-size samples.  I got 4 shades of eye shadow, an eyeliner, and a lip gloss.  If you want to try them out and have Amazon Prime, the price is good on Amazon and you get free shipping.  I recommend anyone on a budget to try this line of shadow.  It is of good quality and much better than those cheap eyeshadow packages your mom always gets you for Christmas that were on sale at Wally World.  This particular palette is very neutral and would be excellent for those that don&#x27;t experiment too much with bright colors but are looking for something highly pigmented and with good staying power.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of flashy makeup, just a little shadow and mascara for daily use. The colors here provide the perfect options of a subtle everyday look to fun going-out options. These colors are beautiful and last all day. I have a warm caucasion complexion with blue eyes and the colors look great! They seem to be compatable with any skin tone, as my hispanic roommate also likes the color scheme, and they compliment her as well. The colors stay on all day and don&#x27;t smear either. Great product and cannot beat the price!</li>
    <li> of course the amount of each color isnt that much but the variety and the dark smokey natural look of the colors makes up for it</li>
    <li> I love this product so much! The eye shadows are rich in color giving you the perfect look for any occasion!</li>
    <li> This set of cosmetics is lovely. Very nice quality lies smoothly on the eye and lasts the whole evening. I will definitely buy another one when I use it all.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting much when I ordered this due to the low price and the fact that I had ordered one like this from another company and it was aweful. I was very suprised when I recieved my iteam, great colors and good quality as well. The colors go on smooth and you don&#x27;t have to pile them on either. They also last all day. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price, this is a GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I bought this palette and it was pkgd great! Bubble wrap was around it to protect it and none of the shadows were broken. I use this palette often and the colors are great! Some are matte and some are shimmer but over all the quality is great! The shadow sizes are about the size of a dime. I have had this palette for a while and I have not run out. The colors are vibrant and stick well using a good prep and prime or paint pod from MAC!</li>
    <li> wife wa pleased with product, she said that their is a good varietyof tone. Shipping was fast. My mother also liked it so i will be ordering another one asap. Good job over all.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadows are small - about the size of a dime.  They are super dense and I find I only need a little bit for a lot of coverage.  I really like using the taupe colors and then sprucing it up a bit with the glitter equivalents.  I&#x27;m not expert on makeup by any means.  This is my first eyeshadow palette bought as an adult woman (late 20s).  I spent money on cheapy, prepackage for blue eyes, etc. and this is much better and worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black eyeshadow was broken, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because I didn&#x27;t plan on using it.  I can always get a single black one if I needed it.  I put a tissue over the colors to prevent them from spreading because a bit of black got onto some other colors.  It does the trick and the colors don&#x27;t rub off on the tissue when closed.</li>
    <li> Have had my Shany Natural Fusion Eyeshadow palette for several weeks now and I love it! The shadows glide on super smooth and are very pigmented. NOT chalky but very silky. Shadows last all day (I do use a eyeshadow primer) with little to no creasing (I have very watery eyes that causes ALL shadows to crease at times). The colors are beautiful with a mixture of shimmer and matte so this palette is very versatile! Perfect for professional make up artists or novices. If you want great quality cosmetics at an even better price? Buy Shany, I plan on making several more purchases!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and she loves the colors and the pigmentations, but when I got the package, one of the eye shadow circles had broken and the eye shadow was all over the box.</li>
    <li> Brilliant color options. Pigments last for many hours.</li>
    <li> The packaging could be improved. One of the black shadows broke/crumbled before it got to me, so when I opened my package, black shadow got EVERYWHERE. The plastic container itself was covered in black eyeshadow, as was the paper packaging. It was quite a mess... and many of the other shadows are covered in black too.</li>
    <li> This was suppose to be a Mothers day gift but when I received it the packaging wasn&#x27;t secure so one of the eyeshadows broke and damaged all the others. Very disappointed because the colors looked beautiful.</li>
    <li> Delivered SUPER FAST and well pigmented, doesn&#x27;t last all night but in my humid climate it is hard to find something that will. Well worth what is paid for it!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the colors, since it is a gift for my daughter, but the packaging is great and the product colors are gorgeous!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I purchased this. I love the colors and it seems to last all day. Can&#x27;t wait to try other products!</li>
    <li> When I received this I opened it right away. The shadows are beutiful but the black eyeshadow was broken and it was all over the place, it got all over my hands and clothes, and three other shadows had glued off its place. I did love the color of the shadows, they stay on very well and they looked very nice on.</li>
    <li> The packaging/shipping could be improved. I must be one of the lucky ones, as only the black cracked. Once I got the black off everything it had come into contact with (including the spots that fell on the floor, transfered to my feet and were tracked all over the kitchen) I was able to adequately do a swatch test on my hand. So far, it&#x27;s good. The pale peach I used on my eye was not as vibrant as I wanted (even over MAC eye primer), but the grape and plum shades were great. I did my makeup early yesterday morning and by the time I went to remove it last night it still looked vibrant. There was no fading or color change. I&#x27;ve only used a few shades, though. If there&#x27;s a big discrepency between the quality of the other shades then I&#x27;ll update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping time was not great. I ordered it on the 19th, it didn&#x27;t even leave the warehouse until the 23rd, and it arrived on the 27th. We&#x27;re prime members in Hawaii. If we were on the mainland it should have arrived with 2-day delivery, but it seems Amazon doesn&#x27;t really bother if a person is in Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico. I would be much happier if they at least made sure it shipped by the next day, because normally it only takes one extra day to get here.... not six.</li>
    <li> Was very surprised in how much I liked this product. I am very picky with the texture of eye shadows and this one was way better than I expected. Very pretty colors and a good balance of matte and shimmer options.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for prom and loved it! The only negative thing I have to say about it is that there was black stuff ALL OVER the case when I bought it. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the black eyeshadow that broke and somehow covered the entire outside of it, but it was very annoying to wash it off and have it all over my hands. Also, the two little brushes that the palette comes with tend to fall out easily of their little holding places. I have no complaints about the actual eyeshadow though. Although I used an eyelid primer, the eyeshadow did crease, but that&#x27;s probably just because I&#x27;m Asian and have no eyelid crease and also because I just have naturally oily eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d recommend this palette to my friends who like makeup. Lots of colors that are very crucial when blending and when trying to get a smooth gradient!</li>
    <li> I wanted a palette with natural, everyday colors. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a palette that consisted of colors I wouldn&#x27;t use. I did a lot of research, I was torn between Shany and Coastal Scents but I decided I&#x27;d go with the less expensive and see how it works out. I ordered this, and kept my fingers crossed that all the shadows would be intact when I received it. The package came about a week later, wrapped tight in bubble wrap. I thought I had lucked out with shadows being broken--wrong! As I got through the packaging I started running into black shadow, it was very messy. Black was the only color that was broken, and I can definitely live without it but I&#x27;d be upset if colors I&#x27;d like to use were busted up. These shadows are very pigmented! A little definitely goes a long way. I use my Coastal Scents brushes (which are great) and barely dab the shadow and it&#x27;s already too dark lol. They blend nicely, and last a lengthy amount of time, without creasing, in combination with my UD Primer Potion. The mix of shimmers and mattes really diversify the looks I can come up with, I&#x27;m excited to come up with some pretty color combos for my brown eyes! Great price, quality and color range!</li>
    <li> I can finally throw away all my single eyeshadows because this palette has it all! Love the matte eyeshadows. It goes on very smooth and lasts just as long as the $15 eyeshadow I buy from Sephora! It came very neatly packaged and not a single color broken upon arrival. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered the SHANY Natural Fusion Eyeshadow pallet,  and I was very happy with my order.  The colors are great and exactly what I wanted.  There are really wonderful day time shadows that are neutral but still really beautiful.  And at the same time, there are great night time shadows that are also vibrant.  The circles are about the size of a dime, maybe a little bigger.  However the colors are so pigmented that a little goes a long way.  Also there are so many colors, that it would be hard to run out of eyeshadow quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my order in about 4 days or ordering it, so I did not have to wait too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the condition of the pallet when I got it, it was a little sloppy.  There was black powder covering the outside of the whole case, and the black eyeshadow circle was broken and was covering many of the other colors.  But you know, I went into this purchase with the knowledge that shipping any type of powder makeup is tricky and often ends badly.  So what I did was, because I didn&#x27;t want the unknown black powder on my hands, I put on rubber gloves and used Windex and paper towels to wipe it off.  It was really easy to wipe off and now my case is beautiful, shiny and professional looking.  As for the broken eyeshadow all I did was use a can of compressed air to gently blow it off the other colors.  It worked great! However if you don&#x27;t have compressed air, you can gently use a fan brush or be even gentler and use a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with this product, and the only reason I gave it a four was because I had to go in and clean the case up a bit.  But as I said before, you should know anytime you buy an eyeshadow pallet there is the risk that things are not going to be perfect and clean straight out of the box.</li>
    <li> Love Shany products-glad I discovered them.  I need another one of these natural palettes my fav colors r gone in mine-use daily-nice product</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I order Shany makeup, and I ordered this palette it came just on time &amp; it&#x27;s perfect I love the colors</li>
    <li> This palette is very nicely sized, but the shadows are in small pots (just like in the picture shown), and although some of the shadows are REALLY pigmented..some of them are not so great. This product lost 2 stars for me when I noticed even with primer on, and with a base, some of these shadows would just simply not stay on no matter what. I do not have time in the day to touch up my makeup, so that is definitely not an option. From the picture, the colors look vibrant..but when they are actually on the lid, that&#x27;s a whole different story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that did make this product really awesome for me was the fact that they had such beautiful gold colors. I don&#x27;t really have any other palette with such great warm golds and browns!</li>
    <li> I received this product yesterday and I am already in love. I also ordered the 24 nail polish set and the very colourful palette like this one. My only complaint is that one of the eyeshadows broke while shipping, but it didn&#x27;t make too much of a mess so I&#x27;m hardly complaining. Really these products are well worth your money and I am so very excited to play with these products. I absolutely love experimenting with makeup on myself and others so this will definitely expand my abilities. I bought the two palettes to replace two that I absolutely loved (there was nothing wrong with them except they were years old). Now I have so many cool colours to play with!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I love the colors that are included in this, it completes my makeup collection. And this product was shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> Move over Tarte, Too-Faced, and Urban Decay! SHANY officially has the best palette out there! The colors are gorgeous and highly pigmented (I was a little worried after I saw another review, but no worries!) I did not not a primer because the colors were so rich and beautiful! I only wish there was more of each color, because I&#x27;ll definitely run through these very quickly, haha. I consider myself a beauty/make-up enthusiast and I am ecstatic to add SHANY Eyeshadow Palette to the line-up! &#x3D;0]</li>
    <li> This is another great kit from Shany. My daughter loved it. Great colors. Great prices. Arrived quickly from purchase date. No problems</li>
    <li> wow these colors are so beautiful! i&#x27;m in love with the natural type colors in this palette! and so many colors too! very light weight. can&#x27;t complain I loveeeee it great for a natural look or a black brown smokey eye look</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews and considering the price I went ahead and ordered a palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have to say its worth it. The packaged arrived on time nice and clean no colors broken. And as far as the colors they are rich and applies easily onto the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure how long the product lasts cause I&#x27;ve yet to really use them ill do a follow up review on YouTube.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife and here is what she says about it: &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a wonderful mix of colors. Some go on glossy, others matte...very nice. No color that I&#x27;ve used so far (about 10 of them or so) has been overwhelming or obnoxious looking. My only advice to others who purchase this is to figure out a system to remember which shadow you used on one eye lid so you can make sure it matches the other. You can easily forget which one you picked when you look up into the mirror and then back down at the palette-- that&#x27;s how many there are! Great, 5-star purchase.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I contemplated for months buying this item. I read all the reviews, I looked up YouTube videos, I looked at all quality control documents about the Ingredients to the pigments. I finally broke down and bought the item. First of all I got it a day early so I was super excited to see It. I got it and it was in the best shape there was no broken eyeshadows the case was intact the company logo was on it it was in the box it was protected. I took it out of the box and I tried it right away I love love love It. I love everything about it the smooth and velvety of the colors the high pigme it was so beautiful the colors are so beautifuly packaged and the colors are so on... I will never buy another Urban Decay eyeshadow palette or nail polish or anything from Sephora ever again I have found a new cosmetic company to buy from SHANY. seller shipped exactly what was promised thank you thank you thank you</li>
    <li> Very nice set of eye shadows.  Shimmery, just as I like.  Applies nicely.  I know I will enjoy the varierty.</li>
    <li> I must say that I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive this palette! but when I did...it was all broken including the Palette, eyeshadow everywere! Poor packaging and poor delivering. I had to send it back for a replacement, because I really like the colors, but if this happends again, then I will no longer order. My rating is only based on how I received product.</li>
    <li> this palette is wonderful! the colors are so pretty and pigmented! a little cheaper than the bh cosmetics and coastal scents one. but its a great buy!</li>
    <li> Excellent pricing and customer service</li>
    <li> I am a stickler for good makeup and I was unsure about this purchase.. Forking out $50 for naked 2 or 3 is just crazy to me, so i thought i&#x27;d try this one out. The color variation is amazing.. the pigment in the make up is great.. it blends smooth and you barely have to use any to get the desired look. I received tons of compliments yesterday on my makeup. Great buy for such a small amount of money. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a really good nude eyeshadow palette, once I stumbled across this one and read the reviews I decided to give it a shot. I received the package in the mail with NO broken eye shadows, it was wrapped with bubble wrap in the companies box which was ALSO wrapped in a thick layer of bubble wrap. I was very pleased with the wrapping of my item. With a little bit of eyeshadow primer these eyeshadows look like they&#x27;re worth hundreds. I do not regret buying this palette what so ever.</li>
    <li> Very good quality! I had fun mixing colors together. Perfect my everyday natural look! Sometimes, when I feel like changing things up, I would use the same palette to do a smokey or summer look! A little last can the whole night out! It&#x27;s a good product to invest in! :)</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition! Beautiful colors - There&#x27;s a nice mix of both matte and shimmer! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited that Shany came out with this palette that I can wear natural colors with. I love that with all of their eyeshadows I can wear a little or a lot and keep adding more color to add more drama!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how Shany Cosmetics can sell quantity and quality but they do every time. These eye shadows are very pigmented and they go on evenly every time. I am so happy I found this cosmetics company.</li>
    <li> I like the product but did not appreciate the fact that the black eye shadow was cracked and all over the surface of the compact.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to be a makeup artist to feel like one, this Shany natural eyeshadow palette is perfect for those of you who aren&#x27;t crazy for big and bold eyeshadow looks, there&#x27;re Matt and shimmer colors, pretty pigmented and look very appealing! I use this palette everyday! No joke.  I recommend this product to those who want something very clean and natural looking, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> I just received in mail, prompt delivery as promised. The packaging was excellent, I have ordered eyeshadow pallets in the past and have been damaged, not in very well packaging. It came in a small box, I opened it there was 3 layers of bubble wrap. First layer was on the outside, removed that followed by another layer surrounding the product, cut that away was in Shany box opened that to see another layer of bubble wrap around the actual pallet, opened to find no broken or cracked shadow there was a protective film over the shadows no powdery residue or smears, all perfectly intact. Money well spent. Eyeshadows are all dime sized this one has very neutral shades exactly what I was looking for they are easy to blend together colors, of course I use a primer to get best results. I would most definitely buy again from Shany. Took pics wish could upload to show.</li>
    <li> Mine just got here and i spent a lot of time cleaning it up. It was messy and the colors were all over the place.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! For the price you can beat it and you have a different color for each day! Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I love my eyeshadow colors. I highly recommend this product for anyone who are beginners just like me and want beautiful natural looking eyes ;) the colors definitely shows which was one of my biggest concerns. Lastly, the shipping a fast ! :D</li>
    <li> Must say,I anticipated and worried about the arrival of this...it way exceeded my expectations!!the BEST packing job I&#x27;ve ever seen!!cant wait to play around with all these fun colors!!!!</li>
    <li> I was VERY pleased with this eyeshadow palette ! It contains a wonderful assortment of colors, the pigmentation quality is what I look for with any eye shadow &amp; this defiantly isn&#x27;t your drug store \\&quot;wet &amp; wild\\&quot;! Nice, slender case, which is easy for storage and a decent sized mirror attached. Personally I fell in love with the warmer tones, I try to go for more of a natural look with my makeup. I would recommend this to anyone! Did I mention I love the pretty black case?lol</li>
    <li> I was a little worried that this might arrived broken, but it was packed well, and everything was in perfect condition.  Colors are true to the photos, and it was a great deal!</li>
    <li> I have bought multiple palettes of this brand and always loved them. This one seems to not be as pigmented as I would like but maybe its the tones on my olive skin vs the product. I do love this brand and my brighter palette seems very pigmented.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic palette, as someone who isn&#x27;t a fan of the bright flashy colors this is perfect for me. I&#x27;ve been looking at the naked palettes from UD and at 50 each it was more than I wanted to spend right now. So glad I didn&#x27;t I really like this one</li>
    <li> Great value for money, delivered in a timely manner. It actually fits in my medium sized purse too if I really feel like taking it with me. I don&#x27;t need to though, it stays on (I also use Mac shadow primer). Lovely colors, both matte and luminous shadows. Only warning- don&#x27;t drop your palette on a tile floor. I did, and a couple shadows crumbled but it mostly stayed intact although the lid won&#x27;t go back on properly but I assume that would happen to any palette. I am thoroughly enjoying this palette despite my clumsiness and will probably buy the other one with the brighter colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just do it! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase (:</li>
    <li> First of all, I was very impressed to have received this product THE VERY NEXT DAY I ordered it, even when I chose the standard method, which was going to take several business days. Now I am glad I did not pay for next day or two day service. Now, let&#x27;s get to the real business: This palette is amazing! The only bad thing was that the black shadow arrived cracked and I had to clean the inside of the case and the mirror and a little bit of black powder that fell on other colors. Other than that, the selection of colors is beautiful! Even though it says \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; colors, you can do pretty much all sorts of combinations because there are gray, black and darker shades. The colors are highly, highly pigmentated and they stay on all day. Considering the price you pay, this is such a great purchase for all of us who love makeup!</li>
    <li> Just Got It in The Mail :)) I Love The colors Im Sooo Happy I&lt;br /&gt;Finally Found A Pallet! Im So Excitedd!!!!! &lt;3</li>
    <li> This pallet looked so promising. I have to admit the colors look amazing they are all gorgeous and great for playing around and exploring. I love almost every shade! however the pigment payout is AWFUL. some colors are more pigmented then others. they looked great when I swatched with my fingers but when applied they seemed to barely show up. to the point where its almost pointless to apply. however there are so many great shades in here i&#x27;m glad i bought it. it&#x27;s great for a lazy day when you have a lot of time to play with your make up and take your time applying enough layers that they show up. be careful because the colors almost look muddy if you use too much product. theres some great shades and it was well worth the price but this pallet is not a go to every day one for me.</li>
    <li> WOW!!! I love them they&#x27;re really cute and more than I expected!</li>
    <li> Arrived broken, there was black and brown shadow all over the package.  Disappointed because the colors have good pigment.</li>
    <li> The colors are soo pretty. One color (matte black) did crack and scatter, but that is the only complaint that i have. Each color is about the size of a dime and has all the same colors as the Costal Scents warm palette and Urban Decays Naked 1 and 2 palette. Great price and very pigmented. I feel it is worth the money and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Makeup has become my new found passion within the last couple of years. I absolutely adore this palette. I have blue eyes so the vibrant corals and purples really make my eyes POP! I&#x27;m extremely clumsy so one thing I was really impressed with was how sturdy the case and the makeup is. I am constantly dropping my makeup or knocking it off the vanity. It hasn&#x27;t broken yet! *knock on wood* I love the mixture of matte and shimmer. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with this but other people might - the palette is an array of natural colors. So make sure you look at the colors before you purchase!</li>
    <li> Love the colors in this palette. Disappointed that one shadow pot was damaged. Kept it anyway.The colors would compliment any eye color.</li>
    <li> I love love this palette. The right mix of coulours to go with any look, day or night. The colours are vivid and last all day and into the night. I travel with it all the time, packing it in my hand luggage.</li>
    <li> AM I THE ONLY PERSON THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ???????!!! OKAY SO I OPEN MY PACKAGE SOOOO EXCITED...AND I GRAB IT OUT...AND MY WHOLEEEE HAND  IS BLACK..IM CONFUSED..THINKING GREAT THE BLCK EYE SHADOW GOT DAMAGEDVDURING SHIIPING...I LOOK AND NOO BLCK WAS INTACT..I STILL DONT KNO WAT IT IS  ...BUT I LITERALLY CANT TOUCH THE PANEL THE SHADOW IS IN...BLACK EYEWHERE !!!IDK IF ITS JUST REALLY CHEAP COLORING OR WAT ..BUT HOW DISAPPOINTING!! ALSO EYE SHAOWS R GREATTT COLORS BUT VERY VERY TINY !!</li>
    <li> Love it! Excellent color choices</li>
    <li> I loveddd this product.. i couldnt believe when i saw the price that this could work cause i founded it kind of cheap or if it was gonna be at least a good product.. but when i opened it i was impressed by the color of each eyeshadow, the texture and the variety of the colors, some of them are shiny, others are matte but they all have excelent pigment. love it!!</li>
    <li> The shadow palette covers all my wardrobe needs! Its shimmer is perfect for mixing and blending. The mirror did come off but I fixed it with some glue.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this eyeshadow case.  Great color selection and price!</li>
    <li> it is very good, and have a lot of colours. like it so so so so so so so much!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for a friend but when i recieved it some of the eye shadows were broken. Other than that the colours looked great i guess. Its a good product for amateurs in a make-up class or just for your own personal use.</li>
    <li> Actually this item was a gift for my daughter and according to her there perfect , just what she wanted .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 16. And I&#x27;ve always loved makeup. And because I have blue eyes browns are my favorite! My palette came sooner than expected and in perfect condition! The colors are even better than I expected and there are even some silvery colors I really like to. It&#x27;s perfect! :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eye shadow palette that had a lot of colors in it because I usually gravitate toward more neutral colored palettes &amp; I&#x27;ve been wanting to experiment with more color. This palette came in very quickly &amp; was packaged nicely! The colors are pretty &amp; pigmented really well. I will say they are a bit powdery which doesn&#x27;t bother me, I just wet my brush when I use them, but I know it may bother some. Perfect palette for beginners &amp; priced great!</li>
    <li> Great coverage. Lots of options. The lighter colors don&#x27;t quite have the pigment i would have hoped for, but the dark/medium ones definitely do.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye pallet so far! I use this everyday! It arrived really quick no broken colors nothin wrong. The colors are amazin very pigmented and work great with an eye primer and elf makeup brushes. I love doin my makeup everyday pickin new colors for how I feel that day, I&#x27;ve been wearin the same 3 colors for years and never thought I would switch it up but everyday I find myself usin a new color in this pallete I love it!</li>
    <li> Small palettes but beautiful mattes and shimmers great buy I luv it actually I will buy more in the future</li>
    <li> When I received this package, I was completely disappointed by the ingredients, which contained Parabens and Talc. From the reviews and the company boasting it&#x27;s 90% natural products, I was expected more from it. I am gonna return this</li>
    <li> i am super impressed with this palette, the colors are absolutely gorgeous and the eye shadows are very pigmented and has lots of shimmer . its very natural and you can do tons and tons of looks with it . its 16 DOLLARS, it can&#x27;t get more afforable than that. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS.</li>
    <li> This is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; palette!! I love every single color and I am amazed how pigmented the colors are. I don&#x27;t like using bright eyeshadows so I purchased this palette for my everyday and smokey night looks. I am so happy I have this palette and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; palette from any other cosmetic company! Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Amazon and two days later I received it. The order was shipped fast, and in good packaging. When I opened the eyeshadow kit up I expected some cosmetic wear or cracks from what I have read with other reviews - but no. The packaging was perfect and the eyeshadows were all pristine and in excellent condition. The colors go on great and I love how there are so many various colors and ranges of all neutral and natural shades. This packaged compliments my Shany 44 bold color set perfectly. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quick and completely intact.  Not only was it boxed with my other products completely surrounded by bubble wrap, it was enveloped in another layer and then the actual palette was wrapped again inside it&#x27;s own box!!! There were no cracks or chips in the shadows which I was worried about.  Each color was rich and highly pigmented.  Some of the shimmery shades were shinier than some but all are very long wearing!!!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> This item showed up extremely dirty. When unwrapped it got my hands covered in some black residue and it still happens occasionally even though ive had the product for a while. Also the eyeshadows arent the best, but they do the job for the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome colors so many to choose from. I&#x27;m more of a neutral color user but they are so pretty. Very worth it.</li>
    <li> It is good but on the picture has different colors .I got light color .</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this palette and will probably never purchase a different one. I was looking for a palette of neutral/nude colors that included mattes as well as shimmers, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on Naked or a similar collection. I&#x27;ve tried other cheap nude palettes and ended up being disappointed in the staying power and the pigment. This collection does not disappoint, all the colors are &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; colors I would actually wear, it includes plenty of mattes as well as shimmers, the colors are very pigmented, and for under $20 it&#x27;s an absolute steal!</li>
    <li> I love this pallet! the colors are perfect and the pigments are amazing! some matte colors too. this is exactly what i was looking for! all shadows came shipped with out any broken, the only thing i dont like is each one is the size of a dime. but a little bit goes a long way with this pallet! shany is my new favorite eye shadow to buy and very affordable! will be buying more of there products!</li>
    <li> I gave this eyeshadow palette to my girlfriend for a gift. Based on the gigantic kiss I got after doing so, I&#x27;d say this is worth 5 stars. It comes nicely wrapped and everything, and the box looks stylish. And stuff.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors. Rey are smooth and stay on all day. I also use the lighter matte colors to set my concealer and it works awesome. And the goldfish tan color to highlight everything. Awesome product for the price, bad thing I can never choose what colors to wear everyday!!</li>
    <li> Those are awsome the color are soooo good. the come perfectly this palette is huge, the colors are beautiful, are very consistent with the climate of Puerto Rico.they  arrived intact&#x27; im very pleased with this brand</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for variety and I am surprised at the quality of this product. Highly pigmented, wonderful colors, a great alternative to the naked palette from urban decay. I have that as well and I like this product just as much. Quick delivery. I will say that one of the colors out of the  eighty eight was broken when I opened the package, but it was packaged pretty tightly with a clear wrap and a bubble wrap inside of a box, inside of a packaging bag lol.. So The shadows are fragile but worth it. I use this palette almost everyday.</li>
    <li> The colors in this palette are great! The eyeshadow does not crease, it stays on the whole day, and goes on very well so you do not need to put a lot on. The shadow does tend to drop onto my cheeks but that isn&#x27;t a big deal. The palette was thoroughly packaged and arrived in perfect condition. I recommend this product to anyone who is interested:)</li>
    <li> There are a lot of shades, which I love. Since i prefer darker shades and look good in them, this was definitely a good buy for me. If you&#x27;re someone who looks better in lighter shades, then I would get a different Palette.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I got all color I like with less money. I was little concern when I purchase it, but now I am satisfied with its quality and colors. I did not give four stars because it is little bit hard to open.</li>
    <li> I only give it a 4 because the small pots means I will have to order it over and over.  But it is a wonderful product and worth the price, and I do professional makeup, there is something for every one.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my girlfriend, she loved them!!! the quantity and quality of the colors were what she was looking for the smile on her face was worth the waiting.</li>
    <li> Great assortment of colors! Goes on smooth and they are not too dark not too light, just perfect. Each color is about a 1/2 inch in diameter so if you really like a certain color it may not have much uses, but i only wear make-up on special occasions so its perfect for me :)</li>
    <li> I typically always wear MAC make-up, but the cost is so taxing on the wallet. So I decided to give this a try. I am brown skin and the color tones look amazing on my skin. I am very pleased and will not be buying high price MAC again....Also the case is very very cute!</li>
    <li> Nice Palette except for a couple of colors were dried up. Almost seem like the colors got wet and it dried up. Those colors were the ones that I like the most. I probably would have loved it if it wasn&#x27;t for the dried up colors! :(</li>
    <li> I love the pallet, unfortunately many colors arrived broken.</li>
    <li> I am using my husbands account but I wanted to say I love this palette! It&#x27;s endless at the looks you can acheive from this one palette! Some are matte and some are shimmer. It was packages very well and arrived in a very timely manner! I would reccommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this palette, many of the colors are unwearable and I have found myself only using a few shades. Also, the product was damaged when it arrived and there was black eyeshadow all over the inside of the palette, which in turn ended up all over my hands.</li>
    <li> The colors are lovely, good variety of shimmer and matte, good hue saturation, and good long wear.  I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with this.</li>
    <li> I love it! The quality of the eyeshadow is amazing for the price. Some are pigmented and some are mattes. Only one eyeshadow was cracked from delivery but not a big deal. The case is also nice and durable.</li>
    <li> REALY good for the price. But the black are not good they crumble and got all over other color.</li>
    <li> I still use this palette from time to time, 3 years after the initial purchase, the colors are still as vibrant and as pigment as before. They are holding up really well. Shany has always been one of my faves cosmetics brand. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It met my expectations and I use it every chance I get! There are so many choices of color to choose from, I love all the pink/purple shade and the variety in general!</li>
    <li> I love all the colors!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my eyeshadow palette!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought them with SHANY&#x27;s 24 Brush set (which I also love)&lt;br /&gt;My brushes pick up the colors very well. &amp; they apply to my eyelids as easy as they should&lt;br /&gt; and I love the colors!&lt;br /&gt;There is a range from everyday colors to very dramatic nights.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday and I have no complaints so far. [a month later]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[ one thing that was negative I would say, for some reason when I received the palette there was a lot of dirt or dust on top of the actual case]&lt;br /&gt;But I wouldn&#x27;t say it interfered with the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;Also I pictured the palette to be bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I only bought this palette to get free shipping with my purchase of SHANY brushes.&lt;br /&gt;However, I am so glad I bought this also!!!</li>
    <li> I love this palette. The nude palette is perfect for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of the colors are pretty shimmery, but the matte ones are fantastic. As far as pigmentation goes, I&#x27;d say definitely use a primer, but you might have to layer some of them in order to get the bright colors you desire. Many of the rosey colors are super pigmented, and the lighter colors do not disapoint. I&#x27;m a little so/so on the browns. I wish most of the browns were.. well.. more pigmented and/or less shimmery. Also plainer browns would&#x27;ve been ideal too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows are about a dime size, but with as many colors as you get, it&#x27;ll take awhile to get through all these shadows! The mirror is big, and superb for traveling. I do not experience much flaking or creasing at all, even while working for 12 hours. They&#x27;re not super creamy like BH Cosmetics palettes or Urban Decay, which sucks, but they are soft in texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this palette. Get a good eye primer (I like Fergie&#x27;s Wet n&#x27; Wild eye primer for a cheap, good-to-go primer), use quality brushes, and you wont be disapointed. :)</li>
    <li> I will get this again. The colors are great. I use a primer under and it stays most of the day. It does not fall and make my face glittery like some do.</li>
    <li> This pallet came with several broken shadows. It took me a long timew to clean up the kit AND my kitchen. Shadow was everywhere.</li>
    <li> The product looks exactly like the picture, came earlier than expected too! However, I rated 3 stars because of shipping and handling. The moment I opened the packing the entire case and bubble wrap was covered in black shadow, it got on everything! All over the carpet and my 150$ comforter, somehow it&#x27;s even on my toes! It&#x27;s only the black shadow that got damaged. So open with care future buyers!</li>
    <li> great item fast shipping</li>
    <li> Dont regret buying at all , loved it!</li>
    <li> I like the colors a lot. They go on smoothly and there are a lot of options. Mine was very well wrapped and it arrived intact. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am still working through this palette years later. I love all the colors and find that I have used almost each one of them (I am fair to medium toned). It was shipped well and quick. Definitely worth the price. Makeup is soft and easy to use, but doesn&#x27;t spread so finely that it dusts all over your cheek.</li>
    <li> This item arrived with the right corner of the compact busted off and several of the eyeshadows were completely busted out.  It was a Christmas gift from my daughters and they were so disappointed when they saw that many of the shadows were busted up.  I still kept it and was grateful for their thoughtfulness.  We will not be buying it again however.</li>
    <li> I often don&#x27;t have time to do makeup, so this is awesome to have you can just put it in your bag doesn&#x27;t take up that much room and it is neutral colors.... love it :)</li>
    <li> This palette is absolutely gorgeous!! All the colors are very pigmented and very high quality!! VERY highly recommended.Great for beginners through pro&#x27;s!!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! It is great for so many different looks. Smokey eyes,soft looking eyes, and even dramatic eyes! If you like to have your makeup on the softer side, this palette is for you! You won&#x27;t regret it because Shany has great quality things that you can never be mad with. TERRIFIC BUY!</li>
    <li> These shadows are not chalky at all- they have great pigmentation and are very velvety. of course, they arent MAC, but for the price, you wont find much better.</li>
    <li> Dying to try the UD Naked pallet but hate the $50 price tag? Get this instead! It gives you tons more colors, with a lower price tag. The pigmentation is wonderful and it lasts allll day! Don&#x27;t waste your money on the UD pallet - you&#x27;re just paying for the name brand. Shany is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I want to start off by saying that I think this is the fastest I have ever received anything in the mail. I just ordered this palette Saturday night and I got it today. The colors in this palette are beautiful and you do not need a lot to apply. None of my shadows were broken or scattered. I am very happy with this purchase especially with this being my first purchase.</li>
    <li> I like that there are so many colors and a great variety in a small pallet. When I received the item one of the colors had smashed and there was a pretty big mess inside the box which of course was the black color and got EVERYWHERE when I was able to open it and took a while to clean and after a couple of weeks the mirror inside won&#x27;t really stay in but other than that I do enjoy the set. The brushes included aren&#x27;t of any quality but I bought a set of brushes when I bought the eyeshadows so I wasn&#x27;t upset with that. Overall I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This neutral pallet is great for a variety of natural looks from very light neutral colors to dark smokey looks; I really enjoy the array of colors. This color pallet also has good pigments upon application. I also enjoy the case it comes in with all the colors in one handy place as well as the mirror for convenience. I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys doing make up especially those natural neutral looks.</li>
    <li> I like the palette. When it came due to shipping there was one that kinda spilled but other than that they were all intact. The colors are very earthy but if you are trying to do multiple layers of colors they don&#x27;t mix too well.</li>
    <li> Colors are great and blends perfect! I would definitely buy this set again!! I use this product almost everyday, the colors are really saturated and I love the shimmer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok just large and hard to hold. Has a lot of shinny colors. I like more matt colors for my age. The younger girls would love it.</li>
    <li> Well pigmented . I use this everyday</li>
    <li> nice colors, well assorted pallet, but the issue is the pots are not locked into the pallet as well as they could and should be. When it arrived there were a few pots that had detached, and can be easily re-glued in with super glue, but this should not have been an issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased every eye shadow brand known to man. I was hesitant to purchase these, because I have seen shadows sold like this before in stores but when I tried them they were very chalky and easily wiped off the skin. These however are gorgeous. They are highly pigmented and do not wipe off easily. I would highly recommend these. The nude colors which I purchased are beautiful. They rival my Urban Decay Naked pallet.</li>
    <li> A lot of colors to choose from, and stays put all day. Most of my other eye shadows don&#x27;t stay on all day, but these do! It also has a mixture of matte and metallic colors.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the great reviews this product has, and the reasonable price, I went ahead and ordered this. Was very pleased when it came in the mail. I use this every day. Love all of the pinks and browns. Just what I had been looking for.</li>
    <li> Nicely pigmented. I used a primer under the eyeshadow and still had to reapply about halfway through the day. Overall, very satisfied with this product :)</li>
    <li> Good quality and the colors look good when applied. For the price, this is a really great deal for the variety and quality.</li>
    <li> Arrived with a few shadows broken. PIgment isn&#x27;t as high as I thought it would be by the reviews I saw. Colors looked great, but didn&#x27;t show up well on others I put it on. Overall an okay product.</li>
    <li> Just got my palette of 88 colors and I am so excited. I was able to buy it based off the other reviews and even got my question answered...can&#x27;t wait to play with the colors. I ordered this last Thursday and I received it on Monday 4/29...</li>
    <li> the colors are very nice, the pallet comes with two little application sponge things. The colors themselves are about the size of a dime, but (at least for me) the pigments are bold enough where I don&#x27;t reed a lot. Pretty satisfied. Except when I received it, it was covered in black dust. I&#x27;m guessing it was from the black, seeing as to how it was broken a little. but otherwise, perfect.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in perfect condition...&lt;br /&gt;The shadows are very pigmented and silky...&lt;br /&gt;These colors look very beautiful on...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s deffinatley a perfect everyday natural look palette...&lt;br /&gt;Shadows are a little small...&lt;br /&gt;May have to repurchase this one it&#x27;s a winner...&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah did I mention that I love this palette?!!!</li>
    <li> I bought it for a gift and she loves it. The great color palette is perrfect for any occasion. The price was good.</li>
