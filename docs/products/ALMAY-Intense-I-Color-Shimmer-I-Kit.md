      <li>Great price and quality here on amazon, too.</li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It goes on like a shimmery version of my skin and looks amazing.  </li>
      <li>Nice colors for it to look like it</li>
      <li>It shows you exactly how to apply them and your eyes will always look beautiful no matter what.</li>
      <li>What is nice about the compact is that it is easy to discern in what order the colors need to be applied.  </li>
      <li>The brow color, on top, should have more.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>and I just bought more to compensate.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>I love these almay shadows  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite eye makeups (and you can&#x27;t beat the price).  </li>
      <li>great color fast shipping</li>
      <li>Not my favorite colors</li>
      <li>I love the pink-gold color in this kit, and the highlighter works well also.</li>
      <li>I love how it demonstrates a suggestion of where the colors should be.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this palette.</li>
      <li>Fit Me!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind though because I love this shade and it makes my eyes stand out.  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s perfectly fine with me because having brown eyes, you can never have too many shades of purple to choose from.</li>
      <li>It has helped me a lot as I begin to feel comfortable with makeup.</li>
      <li>Without using primer, the shades can be quite light and don&#x27;t hold as well as they could.</li>
      <li>Great color, long wear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a pallet that had these colors in it, and I was so excited when I found this one.</li>
      <li>The brow bone (top) is exactly what it&#x27;s should be, a highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>I dont really wear make up but love a good eyeshadow, this stuff was gone by mid day and doesnt &amp;#34;show up&amp;#34; it resides in my makeup graveyard now.</li>
      <li>The colors are soft, and muted, and blend nicely.  </li>
      <li>I love it so much that I thought I would try this eyeshadow by Almay as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Instead, I strongly recommend the Almay Intense Smoky kit for browns!</li>
      <li>should you have to use a primer first</li>
      <li>Excuse Almay did such a great job with this palette of shades.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>love it, and will definitely be ordering again!</li>
      <li>Even though this kit is called the Shimmer kit, the colors in the Smoky kit actually have much more shimmer (however are still very natural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The all over color (bottom/biggest) is actually just iridescent and would be better as an accent on top of other shades.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like this pallet as much as I thought I would.</li>
      <li>Almay Intense I-color</li>
      <li>I have been using Almay Intense I-Color Smoky for browns for over two years.</li>
      <li>It also blends really well when I apply with brushes.</li>
      <li>The pink and the off-white are great, but I actually pull a different color for use on the crease area of my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would definitely order here instead of buying in a drug store because it&#x27;s cheaper here,  that way if you feel the same way I do, you didn&#x27;t spend that much on it :)</li>
      <li>I also have a similar set in another brand and this one not only looks better but also stays on much longer.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, and the price is unbeatable.</li>
      <li>The brown is very dark and for lighter skinned folks, I think a lighter brown would have been more optimal for this color palette.  </li>
      <li>Instead, I am still using the Almay Intense Smoky kit for browns nearly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I paired this with Maybelline New York Color Whisper lipcolor in Made-it-Mauve, and Maybelline New York</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light, shimmery everyday look and the design of the palette is very helpful for beginners to learn how to apply a basic look.</li>
      <li>By far my fave women on the go product!</li>
      <li>The only thing I have to say is that the brown is much darker than shown in the photo, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with that.</li>
      <li>I really like this eye shadow, it is one of my daily</li>
      <li>It stays on pretty long (like 4-6 hours).</li>
      <li>It is a natural look that does compliment brown eyes.  </li>
      <li>I prefer to keep my makeup on the neutral  / natural side, so I have a lot of pinks and browns in my collection.</li>
      <li>The pink is pink but it has a gold tint to it which I love.</li>

<li> The pink is pink but it has a gold tint to it which I love.</li>
<li> It also goes well with Burt&#x27;s Bees Replenishing Lip Balm with Pomegranate Oil, which has the slightest tint and just gives my lips a healthy look for casual days.</li>
<li> also found it strange that the manufacturer only included one applicator when there are three colors.  </li>

<li> It is easy to use, and it is difficult to make mistakes when applying.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is that the dark brown crease/contour shade is SO dark and pigmented that it is easy to overdo it.</li>
<li> FYI - the pink is actually a gold on application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The applicator falls apart before the compact is empty, and could have use two applicators for the three different colors.</li>
<li> There is ample pink, but there could have been a larger amount of off-white for the brow bone area.  </li>
<li> I use Too Faced Shadow Insurance primer and it stays on all day without flaking, feeling dry or irritable.</li>
<li> I am disappointed, because the colors in the Smoky kit are exceptionally soft and easy to blend.  </li>
<li> I wish the actual case was sturdier: the little hinges break apart with usage.</li>
<li> But the applicator was pretty much useless</li>
<li> I do like the colors in this kit, however I do not find myself using this eyeshadow very often because it is so difficult to blend.</li>
<li> It is still the same quality that you expect from almay and just because I didn&#x27;t like it doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t.</li>
<li> This is my go-to everyday shadow.</li>
<li> I have pale skin, medium brown hair, and hazel eyes.</li>
<li> /&gt;Overall, I do not recommend this product because it is so stiff and difficult to blend.</li>
<li> /&gt;Unfortunately, this eyeshadow is also very stiff and makes blending very difficult.</li>

    <li> This product arrived in the mail within 3 or 4 days after its order. I tried it out, and it is very good for beginners with eyeshadow, like me, and it did bring out my chacolate brown eyes like it says to do. I really like it.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyeshadow.  It is easy to use, and it is difficult to make mistakes when applying.  The colors are beautiful.  I purchased others just. Excuse Almay did such a great job with this palette of shades.  I highly recommend it, and the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite colors and I do not feel like this brings out my eyes at a</li>
    <li> I LOVE this palette. Without using primer, the shades can be quite light and don&#x27;t hold as well as they could.

    <li> I just recently started using makeup and this eyeshadow kit is a life savor. I love how it demonstrates a suggestion of where the colors should be. It has helped me a lot as I begin to feel comfortable with makeup. I also have a similar set in another brand and this one not only looks better but also stays on much longer. I would recommend and I&#x27;m definitely purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I did not pay enough attention and did not expect the &amp;#34;shimmer.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a pallet that had these colors in it, and I was so excited when I found this one. I just received it and I&#x27;m already in love. The only thing I have to say is that the brown is much darker than shown in the photo, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with that. The pink is pink but it has a gold tint to it which I love. I love this product</li>
    <li> I love these almay shadows  great eye color matching looks great  I have hazel eyes so the browns and greens and hazels all work for me</li>
    <li> I have pale skin, medium brown hair, and hazel eyes. I prefer to keep my makeup on the neutral  / natural side, so I have a lot of pinks and browns in my collection. I love the pink-gold color in this kit, and the highlighter works well also. My only complaint is that the dark brown crease/contour shade is SO dark and pigmented that it is easy to overdo it. I have to get the smallest amount on my brush and blend, blend, blend. I paired this with Maybelline New York Color Whisper lipcolor in Made-it-Mauve, and Maybelline New York Fit Me! Blush in Medium Nude (both purchased from Amazon). It also goes well with Burt&#x27;s Bees Replenishing Lip Balm with Pomegranate Oil, which has the slightest tint and just gives my lips a healthy look for casual days.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent because is antiallergic. It is a product that the doctor recommended.  My daughter uses it without having skin problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using Almay Intense I-Color Smoky for browns for over two years. I love it so much that I thought I would try this eyeshadow by Almay as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smoky kit consists of a nude shade for the brow bone, a purple for the crease, and a brown for the eyelid. Even though this kit is called the Shimmer kit, the colors in the Smoky kit actually have much more shimmer (however are still very natural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this eyeshadow is also very stiff and makes blending very difficult. I am disappointed, because the colors in the Smoky kit are exceptionally soft and easy to blend.  I do like the colors in this kit, however I do not find myself using this eyeshadow very often because it is so difficult to blend. Instead, I am still using the Almay Intense Smoky kit for browns nearly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do not recommend this product because it is so stiff and difficult to blend. Instead, I strongly recommend the Almay Intense Smoky kit for browns! I have linked it below!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0048ICI78 Almay Intense I-color Smoky-i Kitsmoky-i for Browns, 0.21 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> They quit selling this shade in stores so I had to resort to Amazon. I don&#x27;t mind though because I love this shade and it makes my eyes stand out.  LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> Not quite the color I was looking for.  Looked like it in the picture, but didn&#x27;t show it.</li>
    <li> Nice colors for it to look like it should you have to use a primer first</li>
    <li> What is nice about the compact is that it is easy to discern in what order the colors need to be applied.  There is ample pink, but there could have been a larger amount of off-white for the brow bone area.  The brown is very dark and for lighter skinned folks, I think a lighter brown would have been more optimal for this color palette.  The pink and the off-white are great, but I actually pull a different color for use on the crease area of my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t use primer, you may want to with this product.  It didn&#x27;t last very long without primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found it strange that the manufacturer only included one applicator when there are three colors.  The applicator is junk; it fell apart after 10 uses.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to everyday shadow. It&#x27;s a great daytime shadow or I can darken the crease for a smokey look in the evenings. It also blends really well when I apply with brushes.</li>
    <li> The largest color is the best for my fair skin and brown eyes.  It goes on like a shimmery version of my skin and looks amazing.  I just use that and mascara and I love it.  Great price and quality here on amazon, too.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye shadow, it is one of my daily go to products.  It is a natural look that does compliment brown eyes.  It does not crease or fade.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love this. It lasts all day and the packs leave all the guess work out of combining colors, because its already done for you! By far my fave women on the go product!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  The colors are soft, and muted, and blend nicely.  It stays looking good throughout my work day.  I do not care for the applicator, so if you order it, you might be happier if you also get something to apply it with.</li>
    <li> beautiful color combinations good product arrived in perfect condition, I recommend suffer from allergies and I have fallen a great</li>
    <li> One of my favorite eye makeups (and you can&#x27;t beat the price).  It stays on pretty long (like 4-6 hours).</li>
    <li> I use these shadow kits all the time now. It shows you exactly how to apply them and your eyes will always look beautiful no matter what. I wish the actual case was sturdier: the little hinges break apart with usage.</li>
    <li> Great color, long wear. No-brainer when it comes to how to apply. The brow color, on top, should have more. The applicator falls apart before the compact is empty, and could have use two applicators for the three different colors.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this pallet as much as I thought I would. The crease (middle) shadow is actually a purple color, not brown like I thought. That&#x27;s perfectly fine with me because having brown eyes, you can never have too many shades of purple to choose from. The all over color (bottom/biggest) is actually just iridescent and would be better as an accent on top of other shades. The brow bone (top) is exactly what it&#x27;s should be, a highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I like all the shades, just not as a trio to use together. It is still the same quality that you expect from almay and just because I didn&#x27;t like it doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t. I would definitely order here instead of buying in a drug store because it&#x27;s cheaper here,  that way if you feel the same way I do, you didn&#x27;t spend that much on it :)</li>
    <li> Nothing &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; about this color.  I dont really wear make up but love a good eyeshadow, this stuff was gone by mid day and doesnt &amp;#34;show up&amp;#34; it resides in my makeup graveyard now.</li>
    <li> My go-to eye shadow combo!  Love it!</li>
    <li> When I received my package, the entire palate was crumbled. I didn&#x27;t feel the need or have the patience for a return, so I just tried to save what was left and use that. I do like the colors though. But the applicator was pretty much useless and I just bought more to compensate.</li>
    <li> great color fast shipping</li>
