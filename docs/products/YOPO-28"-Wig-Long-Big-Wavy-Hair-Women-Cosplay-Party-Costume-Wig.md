      <li>I LOVE this wig!</li>

      <li>What parts do tangle are very easily combed out with fingers on the spot.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly as in the photo, i loved it!  </li>
      <li>and honestly it was but not terribly.</li>
      <li>I love love love LOVE it!</li>
      <li>That is all, and I strongly stand by &amp;#34;pictures or it didn&#x27;t happen&amp;#34; so here you go, shows how amazing it looks</li>
      <li>and I love the cut.</li>
      <li>UMMMM can I just say that I&#x27;m in love?</li>
      <li>love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I love the color and the texture.</li>

      <li>Such a great product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an excellent wig and I am  Definitely getting one in another color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously though, this is the best wig I have ever bought, especially at this price.</li>
      <li>I had to nitpick what could be better</li>
      <li>It has a strap inside to help it hug you head better.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I love this wig.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on both how I look, and the quality of the wig.</li>
      <li>I love it...  </li>
      <li>You can see the cap through the top of the wig..</li>
      <li>It shipped super quickly and comes in a great box to store it</li>
      <li>hair is more supple than many cosplay wigs I&#x27;ve seen at this price, and feels like it should style easily.</li>
      <li>The wig is very light, and easy to style.</li>
      <li>It&#x27; soft, it doesn&#x27;t shine and the qualty is great :)</li>
      <li>They are carefully packaged and arrive in the best condition.&amp;quot;</li>
      <li>once on I was able to secure it with bobby pins so that it did not budge.</li>
      <li>I am more than excited.</li>
      <li>Bangs a bit uncontrollable but easily trimmed.</li>
      <li>I might call this color more toward the silvery-gray spectrum than white, but it&#x27;s attractive.</li>
      <li>It styles easily and looks phenominal.</li>
      <li>Its very soft and surprisingly does not tangle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great starter wig for adding colors, cutting, styling, or doing whatever you need to create your perfect costume!</li>
      <li>The color is also as pictured, but it looks more white in bright lighting and silver/ gray in darker lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The texture is silky smooth and so manageable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was available on Amazon Prime which meant free shipping to get it in the time frame I needed.</li>
      <li>Also, the bangs are the kind that don&#x27;t really stay put</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long and look great and easy to maintain.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this wig.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a really nice quality and has a good amount of hair in it, I purchased it in the &amp;#34;Silvery White&amp;#34; and was really pleased with the unit because the color was pretty accurate to the picture, it came pretty much how it is shown in the image, the cap was a good size and fit my head perfectly, the only downfall is that this wig does shed a small amount of hair when wearing and brushing nothing major so don&#x27;t worry, but it was tangle free when I got it out of the box &amp; incredibly soft!  </li>
      <li>The color and length were true to what was pictured.</li>
      <li>It is also surprisingly light, though it is full and beautiful it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or hot.</li>
      <li>That in combination with a hair net does a great job hiding your natural hair.</li>
      <li>Otherwise the style is cute and the wig feels really soft.</li>
      <li>and I can say that the wig fibers are very soft, not shiny and it does not tangle easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great price, and it&#x27;s quality is comparable to more expensive wigs.</li>
      <li>Good price, but thin on the top.  </li>
      <li>The colors are exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>Definitely is higher quality and workmanship than you&#x27;d expect in a wig under $20.  </li>
      <li>I just recieved my wig in the silvery white, and I am absolutely in LOVE with it.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy from again. :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tad bit thin and will tangle easily if you don&#x27;t comb it good.</li>
      <li>It was a lot more wavy than I expected, but very pretty.</li>
      <li>First can we talk about how cute is this hot pink box it arrives in?!</li>
      <li>Nice none the less.</li>
      <li>I really like this wig</li>
      <li>The silver is very silver</li>
      <li>but you can rearrange the hair after gently brushing it</li>
      <li>But worth the cheap price if you order far enough in advance.</li>
      <li>I only recommend this wig for people who either have a small head and not a lot of hair or who are experienced in pinning their wigs to their head within an inch of it&#x27;s life.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying a couple more in different shades.</li>
      <li>I bought this wig for a quick last minute cosplay, and I have Amazon prime</li>
      <li>The quality was so much more than I could have expected!!!</li>
      <li>(YOPO wig is on the left) -- and incidentally, the quality is visibly higher when placed side by side.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So incredibly comfortable and realistic, I could wear it all day everyday and have no issues.</li>
      <li>(it is slightly tangled but the waves stay even after brushing) to fit your preferences.</li>
      <li>if it was bigger that was very disapointing.</li>
      <li>Would definitely buy again, &amp; the shipping was incredibly fast ordered it Thursday April 30th and received it Saturday May 2nd, highly recommended</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any other wigs to compare to, just bought this one for fun.</li>
      <li>It is very soft and much nicer than I expected for the price that I paid.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m posting a pic of it next to a pure white wig so you can compare its color</li>
      <li>It is not curly and only has a slight wave at the bottom exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>I have lots of long thick hair and a not small skull so getting this wig on was a struggle but not impossible and</li>
      <li>It was packaged so nicely, the hair quality is so incredibly soft, it&#x27;s not too thin at all, and I also got it a week from the estimated delivery date!!</li>

    <li> For the money it&#x27;s a okay. I buy cosplay wigs all the time on amazon, i&#x27;ve even bought the other colors from a similar listing, but i bought the silver white one from this listing and i must say it&#x27;s a little on the thin side. You can see the cap through the top of the wig.. I wear beanies or hats with it to hide it.. and it&#x27;s a little on the shiny (fake looking) side. Although i will say it does a good job of not tangling or shedding.</li>
    <li> This wig is very nice for the price I paid for it. It was available on Amazon Prime which meant free shipping to get it in the time frame I needed. The color and length were true to what was pictured. I got the wig for a cosplay and I can say that the wig fibers are very soft, not shiny and it does not tangle easily. What parts do tangle are very easily combed out with fingers on the spot. It is not curly and only has a slight wave at the bottom exactly as pictured. Since the wig was so cheap, I expected it to be a little thin in the back and honestly it was but not terribly. I had received wigs in the past with a comparable price that were in much worse condition. It was nothing that having a friend occasionally check the back of your head wouldn&#x27;t rectify. The biggest shortcoming of this wig I would have to say is the size of the wig cap. It is not big by ANY stretch of the imagination. I have lots of long thick hair and a not small skull so getting this wig on was a struggle but not impossible and once on I was able to secure it with bobby pins so that it did not budge. I only recommend this wig for people who either have a small head and not a lot of hair or who are experienced in pinning their wigs to their head within an inch of it&#x27;s life.</li>
    <li> Amazing wig! The texture is silky smooth and so manageable.&lt;br /&gt;It has amazing thickness, the tracks and wig cap don&#x27;t show &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the fullness and style of this wig. It&#x27;s a great price, and it&#x27;s quality is comparable to more expensive wigs. It does not look nor feel like costume wig. I have not seen any portion of the wig cap peeping though.  However, I am unsure whether color is flattering for my complexion as I have received a &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; from my worst critic.  So, I&#x27;m considering exchanging this unit for a recommended color which may best suit me.</li>
    <li> I love this wig.  It&#x27;s long and look great and easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> First can we talk about how cute is this hot pink box it arrives in?! I received a sample in Silvery White. I might call this color more toward the silvery-gray spectrum than white, but it&#x27;s attractive. I&#x27;m posting a pic of it next to a pure white wig so you can compare its color (YOPO wig is on the left) -- and incidentally, the quality is visibly higher when placed side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is more supple than many cosplay wigs I&#x27;ve seen at this price, and feels like it should style easily. Planning to play with this one and see how it turns out. I may try dyeing it in some semi-perm colors I have &amp; see how that goes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great starter wig for adding colors, cutting, styling, or doing whatever you need to create your perfect costume! Definitely is higher quality and workmanship than you&#x27;d expect in a wig under $20.  Very good buy! ...and I would buy this wig again in other colors.</li>
    <li> I received my wig 4 days earlier than it&#x27;s earliest ETA. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to arrive for a while because some reviews noted that their delivery time took longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little on the thin side but you can rearrange the hair after gently brushing it (it is slightly tangled but the waves stay even after brushing) to fit your preferences. I pinned the bangs to the side on mine and it looks wonderful. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on both how I look, and the quality of the wig. Beautiful beautiful wig! I will definitely buy from again. :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig! Long wavy curls. Bangs a bit uncontrollable but easily trimmed. Perfect Elsa wig.</li>
    <li> I really like this wig, it&#x27;s a really nice quality and has a good amount of hair in it, I purchased it in the &amp;#34;Silvery White&amp;#34; and was really pleased with the unit because the color was pretty accurate to the picture, it came pretty much how it is shown in the image, the cap was a good size and fit my head perfectly, the only downfall is that this wig does shed a small amount of hair when wearing and brushing nothing major so don&#x27;t worry, but it was tangle free when I got it out of the box &amp; incredibly soft!  Would definitely buy again, &amp; the shipping was incredibly fast ordered it Thursday April 30th and received it Saturday May 2nd, highly recommended</li>
    <li> I bought the white/silver wig and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It styles easily and looks phenominal. For those concerned with it being thin, I don&#x27;t find it to be at all. It has a strap inside to help it hug you head better. That in combination with a hair net does a great job hiding your natural hair. It shipped super quickly and comes in a great box to store it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to nitpick what could be better: I wish it was just a tad thicker at the ends. It does also shed a bit at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, this is the best wig I have ever bought, especially at this price. I will definitely be buying a couple more in different shades.</li>
    <li> Its weird like the head is VERY VERY small and Id like it if it was bigger that was very disapointing.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this wig. WELL IT CAME TODAY IN THE WRONG COLOR!!!! I AM FURIOUS! I RECOMMEND NOT BUYING THROUGH YOPO!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly as in the photo, i loved it!  It&#x27; soft, it doesn&#x27;t shine and the qualty is great :)</li>
    <li> This wig i love the texture of. Its very soft and surprisingly does not tangle. This hair is long. I am going to use this for my storm costume for comicon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any other wigs to compare to, just bought this one for fun. It is very soft and much nicer than I expected for the price that I paid.</li>
    <li> The shedding on this thing is ridicules.</li>
    <li> I bought it for Halloween as a Storm (x-men) costume.  The quality is not the greatest, but it was perfect for Halloween.  Pay attention to the shipping details, it comes very slowly.  But worth the cheap price if you order far enough in advance.</li>
    <li> Did not look good on me</li>
    <li> great product arrived on time</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wig! So incredibly comfortable and realistic, I could wear it all day everyday and have no issues. If I hadn&#x27;t ordered the &amp;#34;silvery white&amp;#34; which is a unrealistic color, I think people might have confused it for my real hair. It is also surprisingly light, though it is full and beautiful it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or hot. I love love love LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I ordered the white wig from a different seller but I just wanted to write a review. The wig is great for the price. It&#x27;s a tad bit thin and will tangle easily if you don&#x27;t comb it good. Otherwise the style is cute and the wig feels really soft. Went about elbow length on me</li>
    <li> Very pretty and works great for my Gender Bender Dante Cosplay!</li>
    <li> Such a great product! My daughter needed a wig for the Addams Family Musical and we ordered this one.  The quality was so much more than I could have expected!!! She loved it!</li>
    <li> &amp;quot;Very good wigs. I messed up by not reading the color, i thought the wig was white and its actually silver white. Nice none the less. The colors are exactly as pictured. Regardless i am happy with the purchase. They are carefully packaged and arrive in the best condition.&amp;quot;</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a quick last minute cosplay, and I have Amazon prime so I received it within a couple of days. The wig is very light, and easy to style. It was a lot more wavy than I expected, but very pretty. The color is also as pictured, but it looks more white in bright lighting and silver/ gray in darker lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that the wig is thin, and I had to frequently adjust the hair because the netting underneath would show, but that&#x27;s what you get for its price I guess.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice wig. The only complaint is the net...the dome is too small and it doesn&#x27;t stretch much. So I had to sew in a comb in the fromt. Also, the bangs are the kind that don&#x27;t really stay put so I have to work on those. But I love the color and the texture. I bought it to die and I love the cut.</li>
    <li> Wonderful wig. The silver is very silver and I wanted platinum so I ordered the wrong color. I purchased hair color spray and it colored the wig so well. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Good price, but thin on the top.  Also a bit heavy from the length.  Good for Halloween costume.</li>
    <li> I just recieved my wig in the silvery white, and I am absolutely in LOVE with it. It was packaged so nicely, the hair quality is so incredibly soft, it&#x27;s not too thin at all, and I also got it a week from the estimated delivery date!! I am more than excited. It&#x27;s an excellent wig and I am  Definitely getting one in another color.</li>
    <li> UMMMM can I just say that I&#x27;m in love? That is all, and I strongly stand by &amp;#34;pictures or it didn&#x27;t happen&amp;#34; so here you go, shows how amazing it looks</li>
    <li> I love it...  I can&#x27;t said nothing bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I review this product less than a week after I ordered it (I believe it was 3 days). I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it on yet, but it is beautiful and what I wanted!</li>
