      <li>This soap is very nice lathers very well, but I see no difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>However, if you are just looking for a soap this one does smell pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Would probably work well if you have a pretty good sized hand.  </li>
      <li>Well I must say I am very impressed, Not only have I seen a huge difference in WEEKS</li>
      <li>and I have been impressed with every single purchase.</li>
      <li>This is now one of my favorite soaps have a back up also and this product also leaves a great scent in my Bathroom.</li>

      <li>I recommend all the wonderful little things she has available for sale.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy using this soap.</li>
      <li>I personally think it smells more like a kind of candy than pineapple unlike the cream, which smells just like fresh pineapple to me, but still nice.</li>
      <li>This soap smells like a fruity mixed drink on a warm summer day, it&#x27;s like paradise in my bathtub!</li>
      <li>Lol bought this sooooo long ago and it&#x27;s still in my show as if it hasn&#x27;t been touched.</li>
      <li>They apologized for the error and refunded me my money in addition to sending me the right product!  </li>
      <li>and it leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
      <li>It works up to a nice lather, and the bumps on the soap give my skin a nice little massage.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it leaves my skins smooth, soft but not sticky.</li>
      <li>I am 8 months pregnant and have been getting a lot of cellulite</li>
      <li>Super professional/fast service -- always answers any questions in a prompt manner&lt;</li>
      <li>I am very happy i purchased this Soap ,the scent of the Pineapple Orchid really takes me away not sure about the Cellulite just yet because i just stared using this</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it&#x27;s working on the cellulite but even if it doesn&#x27;t work, just as a soap alone: this stuff is the best!</li>
      <li>I also received free samples of other items which is a nice touch.  </li>
      <li>works well and is a perfect primer preparing he skin for other Anti-cellulite products ( anti-cellulite mud mask, Marocan Mint anti-cellulite cream, Key lime gel anti-cellulite ....)</li>
      <li>Smells nice and is pretty, but the nobby parts of this soap only lasted about 4 showers.</li>
      <li>I loved this product so much that I have bought tons and tons of other products from DivaStuff</li>
      <li>I would definitely order from Diva Stuff again just because of their outstanding customer service.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin soft &amp; smooth.</li>
      <li>I actually notice a difference :)</li>
      <li>first off</li>
      <li>Soap had a fruity pineapple smell and it left my skin feeling refreshed and silky smooth.</li>
      <li>It is also very</li>
      <li>and when im not using it my whole bathroom smells like a tropical island.</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>It went really fast</li>
      <li>Diva Stuff had fast delivery and they even sent me some yummy cherry Chap stick with the soap.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if it really does anything, but can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>and I really like the smell of this soap</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell.</li>
      <li>So I am positive this will only add to the effectiveness of both products.</li>
      <li>Products are absolutely AWESOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly -- all products are natural and they actually DO WORK!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just a bar of soap as far as I&#x27;m concerned</li>
      <li>also makes my skin feel SO soft wherever i use it.</li>
      <li>It is a basic glycerin soap as far as I can tell, and I saw no difference in my skin when I used this as opposed to the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint which I normally use.</li>
      <li>Hard to know for sure since I also used the cream at the same time.</li>
      <li>I will be sad when it&#x27;s gone, but I will for sure buy again!</li>
      <li>Little adorable things Ms. Diva shop sells to wash off the debris of everyday exposure to the elements.  </li>
      <li>but the whole idea of using this in a firm circular motion on affected areas is nearly impossible to do as you cannot get a good grip on it.)</li>

<li> I can tell a slight change in appearance on the back of my thighs and have only been using for a week.</li>
<li> The Black Head little sponges smells like heavens, and leaves the skin as soft as baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
<li> The bar fell apart and left little brown crystals all over my shower.  </li>
<li> Going back to my trusted Soap and Glory products and hope I can at least get back some of the firmness.  </li>
<li> I received this soap along with some other Diva Stuff</li>
<li> I love them all and have never been disappointed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does anything for cellulite, it may work in the long run</li>
<li> Nothing remarkable about this soap, unfortunately :(  </li>
<li> Messy is an understatement.  </li>
<li> The reason I did not order the coffe bar is because reviewers said the coffee soap bar was messy in the shower.</li>
<li> and I was a little worried it would be too much and make me sick</li>
<li> Very disappointing after reading all the positive reviews!</li>
<li> I mean the colour, the shape and the smell.&lt;br</li>
<li> so when I ran across this I thought I would give it a chance, I mean you cant beat the price.</li>
<li> but I think my cellulite is looking worse since I switched over to Diva products.  </li>
<li> and I am shocked how much worse it got.  </li>

    <li> Would probably work well if you have a pretty good sized hand.  A bit too big for mine.  Don&#x27;t know if it really does anything, but can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> smells beautiful and works good!</li>
    <li> This soap smells like a fruity mixed drink on a warm summer day, it&#x27;s like paradise in my bathtub! It works up to a nice lather, and the bumps on the soap give my skin a nice little massage. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it&#x27;s working on the cellulite but even if it doesn&#x27;t work, just as a soap alone: this stuff is the best!</li>
    <li> a massage in the shower. i dont have cellulite but i bought this soap cause the reviews of smell and feel and im glad i did. first off i didnt know it was in my mailbox cause the tacker, i could smell it! and when im not using it my whole bathroom smells like a tropical island. also makes my skin feel SO soft wherever i use it. you can surly tell the difference. another great product from diva stuff (:</li>
    <li> To my surprise, i was contacted by Diva Stuff after I posted the review below.  They apologized for the error and refunded me my money in addition to sending me the right product!  I received my new bar yesterday and it smells wonderful.  I also received free samples of other items which is a nice touch.  I would definitely order from Diva Stuff again just because of their outstanding customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the pineapple bar and received the coffee bar. The reason I did not order the coffe bar is because reviewers said the coffee soap bar was messy in the shower. Messy is an understatement.  The bar fell apart and left little brown crystals all over my shower.  I would not recommend ordering</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  It smells wonderful and does make your skin look better</li>
    <li> Already on my second bar ! I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing has worked ...... Until I bought this soap !</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my cellulite. Can&#x27;t tell, but I may be allergic to something in the soap. Hard to know for sure since I also used the cream at the same time. Smelled great though!</li>
    <li> Stains the shower, do not use, it burns my skin</li>
    <li> I do like this soap. I&#x27;m not sure if it does anything for cellulite, it may work in the long run but I&#x27;ve only had it for a month and haven&#x27; seen a difference, but it does make my skin feel nice and does smell really good. I personally think it smells more like a kind of candy than pineapple unlike the cream, which smells just like fresh pineapple to me, but still nice.</li>
    <li> I have ordered from this Seller before...I can be completely honest in saying the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. Super professional/fast service -- always answers any questions in a prompt manner&lt;br /&gt;2. Products are absolutely AWESOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly -- all products are natural and they actually DO WORK!!&lt;br /&gt;The prices can not be beat!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this soap -- it smells wonderful and you really do see a difference after use --&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on super-expensive chemically infused products that claim to do wonders -- this is a fab product -- and with a list of ingredients that will WOW you!!</li>
    <li> Great and I think it actually is making an improvement.  I love the smell and it leaves my skins smooth, soft but not sticky.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Wish the message side lasted longer.  Diva Stuff had fast delivery and they even sent me some yummy cherry Chap stick with the soap.  I definitely will order from them again!</li>
    <li> Good stuff and smells yummy! This soap works , smooths and softens &amp; moisturizers as well</li>
    <li> I really like this. It smells good and feels like soap on my skin. Except it&#x27;s more than soap. :)</li>
    <li> Smells delicious.  It&#x27;s such a treat to use!  My bathroom smells great even when I&#x27;m not using the bar.  Love Diva Stuff!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this soap. It does improve the appearance of cellulite but you have to massage the desired areas you want to improve. The smell is amazing and I will continue to purchase this soap. This company has really good products.</li>
    <li> This soap is very nice lathers very well, but I see no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> OMG!  Little adorable things Ms. Diva shop sells to wash off the debris of everyday exposure to the elements.  The Black Head little sponges smells like heavens, and leaves the skin as soft as baby&#x27;s butt.  Once I know the results of the anti cellulite bar soap, I&#x27;ll place an order to comment on my findings.  I recommend all the wonderful little things she has available for sale. Ana</li>
    <li> Nothing remarkable about this soap, unfortunately :(  Scent is plastic-y, like from a make-your-own soap kit.  Very disappointing after reading all the positive reviews!</li>
    <li> I am very happy i purchased this Soap ,the scent of the Pineapple Orchid really takes me away not sure about the Cellulite just yet because i just stared using this but i will say it&#x27;s great to get my circulation going.This is now one of my favorite soaps have a back up also and this product also leaves a great scent in my Bathroom. I am really enjoying the Diva Stuff products i have ordered and i am getting hooked because i keep ordering more .</li>
    <li> SMELLS like heaven. Leaves my skin soft &amp; smooth. I can tell a slight change in appearance on the back of my thighs and have only been using for a week. I will be sad when it&#x27;s gone, but I will for sure buy again!</li>
    <li> It smells great and makes my skin so smooth. I have used the pineapple orchid cellulite cream now for awhile and yes it works! So I am positive this will only add to the effectiveness of both products. This feels like a nice massage in the shower! As always another great product from Diva Stuff!</li>
    <li> It went really fast and I saw no difference in skin tone with using this once a day</li>
    <li> Smells okay I guess, but I think my cellulite is looking worse since I switched over to Diva products.  Used for about 2 months and I am shocked how much worse it got.  Going back to my trusted Soap and Glory products and hope I can at least get back some of the firmness.  However, if you are just looking for a soap this one does smell pretty good.  Just would not count on it for cellulite help.  At all.</li>
    <li> I received this soap along with some other Diva Stuff and I really like the smell of this soap and it leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I am 8 months pregnant and have been getting a lot of cellulite so when I ran across this I thought I would give it a chance, I mean you cant beat the price. Well I must say I am very impressed, Not only have I seen a huge difference in WEEKS but the smell is amazing.  I read reviews about the smell and I was a little worried it would be too much and make me sick but it is perfect and I feel and smell so good after showers. I loved this product so much that I have bought tons and tons of other products from DivaStuff and I have been impressed with every single purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap. It did nothing for cellulite at all.</li>
    <li> Idk about the cellulite reduction but the stuff smells greats.</li>
    <li> Soap had a fruity pineapple smell and it left my skin feeling refreshed and silky smooth. Loved this soap !</li>
    <li> Visually this product is itself a piece of Art . I mean the colour, the shape and the smell.&lt;br /&gt;It works well and is a perfect primer preparing he skin for other Anti-cellulite products ( anti-cellulite mud mask, Marocan Mint anti-cellulite cream, Key lime gel anti-cellulite ....).&lt;br /&gt;I got on Divastuff .com website.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several of the Diva Stuff items. I love them all and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell. But it seems to do its job.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and is pretty, but the nobby parts of this soap only lasted about 4 showers. It is a basic glycerin soap as far as I can tell, and I saw no difference in my skin when I used this as opposed to the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint which I normally use. It is also very slippery(I know it is soap... but the whole idea of using this in a firm circular motion on affected areas is nearly impossible to do as you cannot get a good grip on it.) Probably will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Just a bar of soap as far as I&#x27;m concerned</li>
</ol>
