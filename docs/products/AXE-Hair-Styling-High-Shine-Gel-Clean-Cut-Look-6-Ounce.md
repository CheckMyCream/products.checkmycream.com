### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>We have tried a lot of styling gels and creams and this Axe spiking gel is one of the best.  </li>
      <li>This has been the best hair gel I have ever used.</li>
      <li>And, what he liked best about this gel is the ease in which the product washed from his hair.</li>
      <li>This is great for doing just that.</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell to it also!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is reasonably pleasant and not so overpowering that it&#x27;s bothersome.</li>
      <li>This one didn&#x27;t bother him at all, so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
      <li>Great scent as with most Axe products.  </li>
      <li>So I have to find something better than that!</li>
      <li>in all, a GREAT product for not only what it does but for a wonderful price point, too!</li>
      <li>This styling gel smells really nice, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
      <li>Look Gel does a nice job on his hair.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice and it holds hair for 2-3 hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice thing to have around, and I&#x27;ll probably keep buying it.</li>
      <li>we both liked the scent.</li>
      <li>Look Gel works decently but it isn&#x27;t the best gel out there.</li>
      <li>Smells nice - but not too strong of a scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thicker than most styling gels and the hold is a bit better.  </li>
      <li>the spiked up look is remarkably awesome and this makes that possible.</li>
      <li>overall it works Excellent product</li>
      <li>Without a doubt, this is one of the better styling gels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>My husband has a problem with many products making him feel itchy.  </li>
      <li>My favorite is that it doesn&#x27;t stink.  </li>
      <li>Make sure to smell it before buying.</li>
      <li>this provides that great spikey look without looking like the hair is barb wire about ready to cut you.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
      <li>So I would recommend something more durable for the pre-teens in your home.</li>
      <li>This is important if you love to wear a favourite perfume (Chanel #5, anyone?)</li>
      <li>In my experience, I categorize all hair hold products as either gels (where I expect incredible hold) or putties (where I expect moderate hold).  </li>
      <li>You have to use a lot to get a good look, and it leaves your hair greasier than it really should be even with using gels.</li>
      <li>I am not one for strong smells and was pleased that this is more on the mild side of smells.</li>
      <li>so it is easily applied and doesn&#x27;t end up in a clump at the front of their head.  </li>
      <li>This gel has a strong hold that lasts, even in humid environments or with some sweat.</li>
      <li>I always expect Axe products to beat me over the head with a strong cologne scent, but the Axe Styling Spiked Up</li>
      <li>and I have fine hair and his lasts a lot longer.</li>
      <li>My family, co-workers, and I are accustomed to the Axe hair gel scent which is pleasant and masculine.  </li>
      <li>All you need is a little pull through hair by using fingers for best results.</li>
      <li>While it takes a bit to spike longer hair, for short hair, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>I did the spiky hair yesterday, and this gel keeps a fantastic hold.</li>
      <li>This Axe Spiking Gel is easy to apply to damp hair, goes on clear,  and is effective in grooming my spiked up hair throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the best at using this kind of thing, but it&#x27;s not too hard to get reasonable results.</li>
      <li>It is well worth the price!</li>
      <li>/&gt;With the help of this gelatinous material produced by the people of Axe, I&#x27;m able to fight gravity effectively for an entire day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit spicy, clean and manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does not take much gel to be able to shape your hair which is a plus.  </li>
      <li>There are too many cheaper alternatives for gel for me to highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>Overall it is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to style hair, but you really have to wash it off of your hands</li>
      <li>The beauty of the various lengths is that it gives me great flexibility in how to style my hair, from au natural to very spikey or wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has a pretty good hold to it, easy to style with, not too hard and keeps throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>Overall just ok.</li>
      <li>If you can keep from touching the hair the gel will last, otherwise it&#x27;s as if you never used it.</li>
      <li>I cannot testify to wavy or coarse hair (which I imagine might be slightly more of a challenge to spike).</li>
      <li>with most Axe products, this oversized tube will last you quite a while.</li>
      <li>Finally found something that both my wife and I can use, AND we&#x27;re both very satisfied...will be coming back for more!!</li>
      <li>It dries to a stiff finish and has good staying power.  </li>
      <li>It kind of cracks me up that my kids taught me to style my hair rather than the other way around.</li>
      <li>Now, it is important to note that his hair is straight, soft and silky ...</li>
      <li>It has a really strong fragrance which I don&#x27;t personally like, but your mileage may vary.  </li>
      <li>and it certainly does keep his hair the way we set it up all day.</li>
      <li>No oily residue and the hair really  holds up.</li>
      <li>The gel was more &amp;#34;liquidy,&amp;#34; than I expected and as I suspected - it didn&#x27;t hold the way that I wanted.  </li>
      <li>My son has medium weight, straight hair.  </li>
      <li>This gel has a touch of scent and makes his hair stand straight up.</li>
      <li>Some salon products I&#x27;ve used are better, but for this price range, it performs as expected.</li>
      <li>It takes but a dollop on the fingertips for short hair, and with a bit of working through, and a short time of no-touch to let it dry, it cements to a nice clean crisp of great-looking pointy hair.</li>
      <li>Like most objects on this planet, my hair - light though it is - generally caves to the power of gravity and resides limply on my noggin.</li>
      <li>I tend to like when my husband has some spikes in his hair compared to most of his other hair styles.  </li>
      <li>This way, I don&#x27;t always smell my husband&#x27;s hair gel over his other scents that are more pleasing to me.</li>
      <li>I gloop a bit of the material on my fingertips (not too much is needed); apply it to my wet hair; style my hair in bold and exciting ways; allow the material to convert from gelatinous to shiny crustification; and</li>
      <li>The hold is enough for the hot days and keeps your style looking fresh.  </li>
      <li>Like all spike gels with a strong hold, my hair gets a bit stiff and crunchy by the end of the day but this gel washes right out with any shampoo.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a quick dry gel that holds REALLY well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Although I&#x27;m a \\&quot;chick\\&quot;, I really like the AXE product line because it first of all WORKS and second of all, doesn&#x27;t have that often cloying smell that \\&quot;girly\\&quot; products have.</li>
      <li>It takes only a small amount, and gives a good amount of hold and definition to his hair which lasts through the day.  </li>
      <li>the secret to having good hair.</li>
      <li>and it seemed to last a good 6 hours into the school day, while other competitors only lasted 4 with his movement and activities.</li>
      <li>The 7 year old and 12 year old, not so much.</li>
      <li>I have medium-fine, straight hair that oddly resists most styling products unless it&#x27;s piled on to such a degree as to make my head look like a ball of grease, mousse flakes, or wax helmet.</li>
      <li>He usually keeps it cut very short, but when it starts to grow out, he definitely needs to use a styling product to make it look good.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t really feel very sticky in the hair - it feels fairly soft, unlike some that will &#x27;bond&#x27; hair so that it gets very stiff.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a clear gel that dries clear with no flaking, and it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.  </li>
      <li>it was completely gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got it and use it on my 3 year old to keep his hair in place.</li>
      <li>Now that I do I realize a simple gel like this gives you a ton of styling options and really helps when you are going out to keep your hair in place.</li>
      <li>So far this Axe Styling Spiked</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s thick enough to feel really gunky on your hands, and I can&#x27;t wait to get them washed after touching this product.  </li>
      <li>His hair isn&#x27;t really long, so I think it looks better spiked than messy.  </li>
      <li>If you want &amp;#34;indestructible hold,&amp;#34; try Hard Up gel by Short Sexy Hair.</li>
      <li>A little bit tends to go a very long way, and application is easy.</li>
      <li>This stuff does a moderate job of resisting high humidity  before starting to lose it&#x27;s hold.</li>
      <li>Amazing hair gell ,however one down side since it is hard to get out of the hair even with a shower.</li>
      <li>I like my hair short and naturally spiky during warmer weather.  </li>
      <li>This has a fairly mild scent that is hard to place.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very much like other axe products--clean, somewhat masculine, and a little musky.</li>
      <li>My nephew visits me regularly and has the typical young boy fondness for Axe, so I&#x27;ve been having a bit of fun with him using their products to mess around with his hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells nice - but not too strong of a scent.  Holds my husband&#x27;s hair in place all day but doesn&#x27;t look greasy and gross.  I definitely like this stuff, considering it&#x27;s 1/10 of the price of the salon products I was buying him before!</li>
    <li> Amazing hair gell ,however one down side since it is hard to get out of the hair even with a shower.</li>
    <li> There are too many cheaper alternatives for gel for me to highly recommend this. It works as described but I was trying as an alternative to some of the pomade, wax and paste products at a lower cost and am going back to the paste. All the paste and pomade products tend to be similarly priced so would recommend the axe versions of those.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, works well, i like it. works well with blonde hair</li>
    <li> This has been the best hair gel I have ever used. Keeps a hold without that wet look a lot of other hair gels can give you. However it loses a star because it is very expensive.</li>
    <li> Finally found something that both my wife and I can use, AND we&#x27;re both very satisfied...will be coming back for more!!</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;Axe Styling Spiked Up Look Gel&amp;#34; works well on relatively short or medium length hair. This provides decent hold if used as directed, with damp hair and a little dab of gel. It doesn&#x27;t have to be used for spiking hair, it works well on regular styles as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> I have medium-fine, straight hair that oddly resists most styling products unless it&#x27;s piled on to such a degree as to make my head look like a ball of grease, mousse flakes, or wax helmet. With Axe Styling Spiked Up Look Gel, I get all day hold that keeps my hair where I want it, without making my hair look like it has styling product in it. This styling gel smells really nice, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering. A little bit tends to go a very long way, and application is easy. This stuff does a moderate job of resisting high humidity  before starting to lose it&#x27;s hold. Without a doubt, this is one of the better styling gels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

My family, co-workers, and I are accustomed to the Axe hair gel scent which is pleasant and masculine.  Like all spike gels with a strong hold, my hair gets a bit stiff and crunchy by the end of the day but this gel washes right out with any shampoo.</li>
    <li> My son loves his hair spiked. This is great for doing just that. This gel has a touch of scent and makes his hair stand straight up. He says it brings out the rocker in him.  All you need is a little pull through hair by using fingers for best results. overall it works Excellent product</li>
    <li> I got it and use it on my 3 year old to keep his hair in place. It smells nice and it holds hair for 2-3 hours. Then it dries and it doesn&#x27;t hold the style anymore. So I have to find something better than that!</li>
    <li> This has a pretty good hold to it, easy to style with, not too hard and keeps throughout the day.  It has a nice smell to it also!</li>
    <li> My nephew visits me regularly and has the typical young boy fondness for Axe, so I&#x27;ve been having a bit of fun with him using their products to mess around with his hair.

    <li> My son has medium weight, straight hair.  He usually keeps it cut very short, but when it starts to grow out, he definitely needs to use a styling product to make it look good.  This Axe Styling Spiked Up Look Gel does a nice job on his hair.  It takes only a small amount, and gives a good amount of hold and definition to his hair which lasts through the day.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the fragrance, but he doesn&#x27;t mind it.  At any rate, the fragrance wears off after a few minutes and isn&#x27;t noticable.</li>
    <li> This will spike shorter hair and give texture to longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a clear gel that dries clear with no flaking, and it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.  It&#x27;s thicker than most styling gels and the hold is a bit better.  It will spike up short hair, and help control/give volume and wet &#x27;messiness&#x27; to longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fragrance.  It&#x27;s a bit spicy, clean and manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is the way it feels on my hands- it&#x27;s thick enough to feel really gunky on your hands, and I can&#x27;t wait to get them washed after touching this product.  Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t really feel very sticky in the hair - it feels fairly soft, unlike some that will &#x27;bond&#x27; hair so that it gets very stiff.  It&#x27;s not at all glue-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On long wavy hair, it will cause it to curl.  My husband has a problem with many products making him feel itchy.  This one didn&#x27;t bother him at all, so that&#x27;s good.  You can tell there is &#x27;something&#x27; in your hair, but it&#x27;s not too bothersome with this gel.  Overall it is pretty good.  Some salon products I&#x27;ve used are better, but for this price range, it performs as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the never-ending search for a hair gel for my twin boys.  It can&#x27;t be too crunchy or hard for them to apply… but has to hold their hair all day long.  So far this Axe Styling Spiked Up Look Gel is #1 on their list.  Another plus is that the gel doesn&#x27;t feel like glue in your hand so it is easily applied and doesn&#x27;t end up in a clump at the front of their head.  Their hair doesn&#x27;t appear greasy and if you touch it you won&#x27;t draw blood!  We&#x27;ll be buying this gel again when they run out!</li>
    <li> I like Axe products. This spiking gel is no different. I have thick greying hair which was once very curly and now is a little harder to control with the the grey hair being straighter and my brown hair being wavy. That being said, I am always looking for a product to restore my hair back to its former glory. It does not take much gel to be able to shape your hair which is a plus.  It dries a little harder than Axe Messy which I prefer, but my wife who occasionally uses it does not. If you need hold without the flake than this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I always expect Axe products to beat me over the head with a strong cologne scent, but the Axe Styling Spiked Up Look Gel isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.  The gel itself wasn&#x27;t sticky or gooey like some hair gel can be, and it held my hair in place all day without flaking.</li>
    <li> I have very short hair of 1-3\\&quot; depending upon where it&#x27;s located on my head. The beauty of the various lengths is that it gives me great flexibility in how to style my hair, from au natural to very spikey or wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m a \\&quot;chick\\&quot;, I really like the AXE product line because it first of all WORKS and second of all, doesn&#x27;t have that often cloying smell that \\&quot;girly\\&quot; products have. This is important if you love to wear a favourite perfume (Chanel #5, anyone?) and you don&#x27;t want a silly hair product to compete with your fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Styling is a snap: place a small portion on your hands and work it into damp hair. I flip my head downward and use a diffuser on my blow-dryer to dry it; it seems to \\&quot;lock in\\&quot; the spikes for longer wear than when I air dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is marginal. The gel is NOT sticky. And it holds up quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a GREAT product for not only what it does but for a wonderful price point, too!</li>
    <li> I am not one for strong smells and was pleased that this is more on the mild side of smells.We used this product on Crazy Hair Day with some color in it and it seemed to hold up well with the school day. I placed it on his hair when it was almost dry and it seemed to last a good 6 hours into the school day, while other competitors only lasted 4 with his movement and activities.</li>
    <li> This works and we approve of its spiking power.  The hold is enough for the hot days and keeps your style looking fresh.  We are fans of the scent as well.</li>
    <li> I use this on my sideburns to hold them down throughout the day.  I don&#x27;t like a really wet look so I don&#x27;t use this on my hair.  I use the Axe &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; cream instead.  But I do like it for areas of my hair that have a tendancy to curl up.</li>
    <li> I used this in my boyfriend&#x27;s hair. No doubt, this product has hold. Now, it is important to note that his hair is straight, soft and silky ... I cannot testify to wavy or coarse hair (which I imagine might be slightly more of a challenge to spike). The results lasted throughout an evening of craziness. And, what he liked best about this gel is the ease in which the product washed from his hair. (One standard wash and it was completely gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most Axe products, this oversized tube will last you quite a while. It is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> This gel starts off sticky and dries to a really stiff finish.  It is easy to style hair, but you really have to wash it off of your hands well when you&#x27;re done -- it&#x27;s almost like having honey on your skin.  It dries to a stiff finish and has good staying power.  It leaves hair feeling crusty to the touch.  It has a really strong fragrance which I don&#x27;t personally like, but your mileage may vary.  Make sure to smell it before buying.</li>
    <li> we both liked the scent. He likes the feel of the product. The 7 year old and 12 year old, not so much. I don&#x27;t think it is the product but rather the age. If you can keep from touching the hair the gel will last, otherwise it&#x27;s as if you never used it. So I would recommend something more durable for the pre-teens in your home.</li>
    <li> I did the spiky hair yesterday, and this gel keeps a fantastic hold. It takes but a dollop on the fingertips for short hair, and with a bit of working through, and a short time of no-touch to let it dry, it cements to a nice clean crisp of great-looking pointy hair. It works terrifically.</li>
    <li> We have tried a lot of styling gels and creams and this Axe spiking gel is one of the best.  No oily residue and the hair really  holds up. It kind of cracks me up that my kids taught me to style my hair rather than the other way around. It just wasn&#x27;t something I grew up putting in my hair. Now that I do I realize a simple gel like this gives you a ton of styling options and really helps when you are going out to keep your hair in place. One thing to note is that  it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold as long with finer hair.  MY oldest son has courser hair and I have fine hair and his lasts a lot longer.</li>
    <li> Like most objects on this planet, my hair - light though it is - generally caves to the power of gravity and resides limply on my noggin. With the help of some water, I can counteract this gravitational effect...temporarily. Eventually though, my hair seems to say &amp;#34;Forget it...let&#x27;s relax and flop over.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of this gelatinous material produced by the people of Axe, I&#x27;m able to fight gravity effectively for an entire day. I gloop a bit of the material on my fingertips (not too much is needed); apply it to my wet hair; style my hair in bold and exciting ways; allow the material to convert from gelatinous to shiny crustification; and *wham* gravity&#x27;s power is minimized to the max!</li>
    <li> I tend to like when my husband has some spikes in his hair compared to most of his other hair styles.  His hair isn&#x27;t really long, so I think it looks better spiked than messy.  It&#x27;s a quick dry gel that holds REALLY well.  My favorite is that it doesn&#x27;t stink.  This has a fairly mild scent that is hard to place.  It is not girly by any means, but it also doesn&#x27;t smell like a Christmas tree.  This way, I don&#x27;t always smell my husband&#x27;s hair gel over his other scents that are more pleasing to me.</li>
    <li> this provides that great spikey look without looking like the hair is barb wire about ready to cut you.&lt;br /&gt;Like with all axe products it has a bit stronger of a scent than I like but step son seems to like it.</li>
    <li> the secret to having good hair. the spiked up look is remarkably awesome and this makes that possible.</li>
    <li> This gel has a strong hold that lasts, even in humid environments or with some sweat. While it takes a bit to spike longer hair, for short hair, it&#x27;s great. The scent is very much like other axe products--clean, somewhat masculine, and a little musky. The gel has a glossy finish with stiffness, which is expected for this type of gel, and depending on the desired look, you might need to back off a little in terms of quantity.</li>
    <li> Great scent as with most Axe products.  A bit too firm of a hold for my taste.  If you are big into spiky/military haircuts, then this is the product for you!!!!</li>
    <li> Axe Styling Spiked Up Look Gel works decently but it isn&#x27;t the best gel out there. You have to use a lot to get a good look, and it leaves your hair greasier than it really should be even with using gels. Overall just ok.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of hair care products since my college years - it helps that I&#x27;ve maintained a &amp;#34;spiky,&amp;#34; hairstyle for all of this time.  In my experience, I categorize all hair hold products as either gels (where I expect incredible hold) or putties (where I expect moderate hold).  I knew that this gel would be disappointing when I used it for the first time.  The gel was more &amp;#34;liquidy,&amp;#34; than I expected and as I suspected - it didn&#x27;t hold the way that I wanted.  If you want &amp;#34;indestructible hold,&amp;#34; try Hard Up gel by Short Sexy Hair.</li>
