### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;I was very happy to see this over the counter Nail Fungus Treatment, since I don&#x27;t want to go to the doctor or have my toenail removed.</li>
      <li>This product arrived in a timely manner and was packaged perfectly , it arrived in excellent condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
      <li>I researched the herbal clinical trials to see what was found to consistently work the best and this product included the most effective.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to try this since all the reviews are good :)  </li>
      <li>It also works as a nail whitener when used after fungus is gone on newly healthy nails to improve appearance.</li>
      <li>, it is clearer and getting better</li>
      <li>I would consider adjusting the rating if I see additional results after I&#x27;ve had more time to use it.</li>

      <li>is very early to make a more accurate opinion.</li>
      <li>, I only hope it will be effective by the time I finish using it.</li>
      <li>WE used it on a pretty severe case of toe fungus and will take a long time for it to be totally effective</li>

      <li>Appreciated that this was a prime item.</li>
      <li>The product does work, but the bottle is only filled halfway.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a potent treatment that uses only natural ingredients-this is the one.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and unlike other users did not find the smell to be very strong or aversive.</li>
      <li>seems to be working, better than any other I have tried</li>
      <li>My bottle came 1/4 full and package had obviously been opened.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this product .</li>
      <li>i contacted the seller to find out, why it was not filled to the top of the bottle, to date without response to my inquiry.</li>
      <li>It took 3 bottles (about 6 months) for my toes to be clear.</li>
      <li>anti fungal, nail treatment - restore nails to their natural state.</li>
      <li>and it seems to be working so far</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>I have tried nearly every nail fungus product under the sun, and nothing has come close to how well this stuff has worked.</li>
      <li>Glad to empty shelf and drawer of hundreds of dollars of every other product that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Also there is a strong odor and the small bottle is only half full.</li>
      <li>I just received the item, the bottle came half full, obviously had been opened before.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t clear up over night, but stick with it - you definitely won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
      <li>So far my only comment is that the bottle arrived less than half full...</li>
      <li>I wish they used an even smaller bottle and filled it up or explained somewhere that it will be half and why it will be half.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is less than half full.</li>

<li> The bottle is less than half full.</li>
<li> Half of such a small bottle filled for $36.00---I could not believe it.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t use this product long enough to rate the effectiness of it, I know I will not reorder it, when I used the product Nail fungus treatment</li>
<li> I have been using this on my big toes everyday for three months and all I can say is WOW!</li>
<li> The active ingredient is Undecylenic acid (15%), which is used as a topical antifungal agent.</li>
<li> The bottle is dark blue but one can see through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> the bottle was a very small bottle and it was less than half full.</li>
<li> On the package, there are no directions for using the Nail Fungus Treatment other than wash and dry the area before applying.</li>
<li> When you pay over $30.00 per bottle and it is almost empty</li>
<li> Was delivered with half spilled out of the bottle due to a loose lid.</li>
<li> The bottle is already small, and you only receive half.</li>
<li> have had a toe fungus for awhile and have had no success trying to get rid of it.</li>
<li> No more black, loose</li>
<li> since the bottle half liquid content was too little, the product lasted for less than 2 weeks.</li>
<li> Product was delivered in time, although the bottle was not full.</li>
<li> It would be easier to use if it had a little brush instead.</li>
<li> I wasted a 1000.00 on laser treatments.</li>
<li> few weeks ago I thought one toenail looked a bit off-color.</li>
<li> Applied only thin layer diligently.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> Like an idiot I thought since this was expensive and had 4 1/2 stars it must be good.</li>
<li> Tthe product looks like it works, but I get the small bottle in half,</li>
<li> I was told it was bad for your liver, so I only took it a couple of months and used some prescription antifungal  cream on my toe at the same time.</li>
<li> These two extra items were stuck into some old prescription bottles and packed with some filthy cotton swabs that looked like somebody had cleaned their ears with them.</li>
<li> buying more is not an option for me with the outrageous price of this product.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s an expensive price for the amount that is actually in the package...</li>
<li> The reason it&#x27;s expensive is because it came with 2 other items I do not need, but have been charged for.</li>
<li> I have not experienced any burning, itching or stinging by using the Nail Fungus Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Even if this stuff works, I&#x27;m not happy with the overcharge.</li>
<li> Not happy at all.</li>
<li> something is wrong with this company.</li>
<li> So disappointing.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if this stuff works; I couldn&#x27;t bear to use it because the smell was so bad.</li>
<li> So disappointing!</li>
<li> very disappointed.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Another nail fungus treatment that doesn&#x27;t work. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used this on my husband&#x27;s toenails. It has only been 2 days but I can already tell a difference that it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Yes the bottle isn&#x27;t full - but you get volume you paid for. The smell is differ but not obnoxious as if your wearing Ben gay or something similar. Applied every time I could think to - am - pm - after shower/bath. Wow. It works. Applied only thin layer diligently. Have fought this issue for years and it&#x27;s working. Glad to empty shelf and drawer of hundreds of dollars of every other product that didn&#x27;t work. Price was steep but since it works it&#x27;s not so steep.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this stuff works; I couldn&#x27;t bear to use it because the smell was so bad. I tried for a few days, but the smell permeated the air around me so much, I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> seems to be working, better than any other I have tried</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous nail treatment , this product arrived just as described . This product arrived in a timely manner and was packaged perfectly , it arrived in excellent condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a Omiera Labs Podiazole nail fungus treatment, toenail fungus treatment, nails anti fungal, nail treatment - restore nails to their natural state. Omiera Labs Podiazole is a potent nail fungus treatment and toenail fungus treatment, eliminating fungus and its symptoms faster than other available remedies.It kills nail fungus, fingernail and toenail fungus, so your nails feel healthy and attractive.It also works as a nail whitener when used after fungus is gone on newly healthy nails to improve appearance.May be used before nail polish, pedicure, manicure, and after using nail clippers or nail file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a toe fungus for awhile and have had no success trying to get rid of it. I actually got it from a nail salon who doesn&#x27;t follow proper sterilization of their tools .I have been using this for awhile and it seems to be working so far , it is clearer and getting better I will continue with this as it is working .I will update further down the line with more results , but so far so good .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m excited to try this since all the reviews are good :)  I&#x27;ll update on info</li>
    <li> My bottle came 1/4 full and package had obviously been opened.  So disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my big toes everyday for three months and all I can say is WOW! Finally something that works on the stubborn fungus I have been fighting for five years now. I have tried nearly every nail fungus product under the sun, and nothing has come close to how well this stuff has worked. It won&#x27;t clear up over night, but stick with it - you definitely won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I just received the item, the bottle came half full, obviously had been opened before. So disappointing!</li>
    <li> The quality of ingredients in this product was excellent and it knocked the problem out in less than 2 months. I researched the herbal clinical trials to see what was found to consistently work the best and this product included the most effective.  I highly recommend this product and unlike other users did not find the smell to be very strong or aversive. If you are looking for a potent treatment that uses only natural ingredients-this is the one.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use this product long enough to rate the effectiness of it, I know I will not reorder it, when I used the product Nail fungus treatment the bottle was a very small bottle and it was less than half full. When you pay over $30.00 per bottle and it is almost empty something is wrong with this company. Would not recommend Nail Fungus Treatment by Omiera labs</li>
    <li> The product does work, but the bottle is only filled halfway. The bottle is already small, and you only receive half. Don&#x27;t expect a full bottle!!! It&#x27;s an expensive price for the amount that is actually in the package...a bit deceptive.</li>
    <li> The glass dropper is cumbersome to use since I need to use it around my toe nails. It would be easier to use if it had a little brush instead. Also there is a strong odor and the small bottle is only half full. I don&#x27;t understand that! But hopefully it works, don&#x27;t know yet since I just got it.</li>
    <li> Tthe product looks like it works, but I get the small bottle in half, is very early to make a more accurate opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been trating my toes for over 20 years.  I have tried everything over the counter. I tried the prescription product. I wasted a 1000.00 on laser treatments. It took 3 bottles (about 6 months) for my toes to be clear. No more black, loose nails.&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I thought one toenail looked a bit off-color. I immediately ordered another bottle and 2 weeks later my toes are clear.&lt;br /&gt;I have knocked one point off my rating since 3 of my bottles were only 1/2 full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;r my toes to be cleae&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 years</li>
    <li> Paid $35.00 and just received today. The bottle is less than half full. Package it came in looked like it had been returned. Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Smells strong, but works great.&lt;br /&gt;Used on foot for athlete&#x27;s foot, too, and it worked wonders</li>
    <li> i gave the product a 1 star for the main reason - i received a bottle with barely half of liquid content, as if i am being rip off, given the price tag of $35.00, it sure is too expensive. i contacted the seller to find out, why it was not filled to the top of the bottle, to date without response to my inquiry. since the bottle half liquid content was too little, the product lasted for less than 2 weeks. the liquid were all gone in way too short period, did not notice any change in terms of - if it was treating the toe nails, as the product claims it will treat infected toe nails. buying more is not an option for me with the outrageous price of this product.</li>
    <li> So far my only comment is that the bottle arrived less than half full...</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in time, although the bottle was not full. Product has quite an odor, however it seems to be working after 2 weeks of use. I would consider adjusting the rating if I see additional results after I&#x27;ve had more time to use it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet</li>
    <li> This chemical seems to be helping quite a bit.  If used as directed, the fungus is eliminated.  WE used it on a pretty severe case of toe fungus and will take a long time for it to be totally effective so we have a ways to go before we know the longer term effect.</li>
    <li> Like an idiot I thought since this was expensive and had 4 1/2 stars it must be good. Just recieved it 2 days ago. The reason it&#x27;s expensive is because it came with 2 other items I do not need, but have been charged for. Some bogus &amp;#34;hair growth&amp;#34; liquid and a &amp;#34;pain killer&amp;#34; liquid. These two extra items were stuck into some old prescription bottles and packed with some filthy cotton swabs that looked like somebody had cleaned their ears with them. Even if this stuff works, I&#x27;m not happy with the overcharge. I would like to send the unwanted junk back and get a refund.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing to help me nail problems.  Appreciated that this was a prime item.</li>
    <li> I have one toe with a nail fungus on it. It is embarrassing trying to wear sandals in the summer, and I don&#x27;t like to paint my toenails. A couple of years ago I had a fungus on my big toe and the doctor prescribed  antifungal tablets to take for six months. I was told it was bad for your liver, so I only took it a couple of months and used some prescription antifungal  cream on my toe at the same time. It finally went away and now I am faced with another toe with the  dreaded toenail fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy to see this over the counter Nail Fungus Treatment, since I don&#x27;t want to go to the doctor or have my toenail removed. I am very hopeful that this Nail Fungus Treatment will work on my toe. On the package, there are no directions for using the Nail Fungus Treatment other than wash and dry the area before applying. It doesn&#x27;t tell you how many times a day or how much to apply,  so I have been applying it twice a day. The active ingredient is Undecylenic acid (15%), which is used as a topical antifungal agent. I have not experienced any burning, itching or stinging by using the Nail Fungus Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very important that you wash your nails each time very well and dry them before you apply the Nail Fungus Treatment. You need to continue treating your nail and trim off the infected nail until the infection is eliminated. Depending on your nail, you may need to use this topical nail treatment for up to six months, hopefully you will see improvements within one to three months.&lt;br /&gt;I will update in a month on my nail progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Half of such a small bottle filled for $36.00---I could not believe it.  I received the product yesterday (August 5)  I wish they used an even smaller bottle and filled it up or explained somewhere that it will be half and why it will be half.  The bottle is dark blue but one can see through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have it, I only hope it will be effective by the time I finish using it.</li>
    <li> Was delivered with half spilled out of the bottle due to a loose lid. Returned.</li>
    <li> I would give it no stars if that was an option.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Did not help at all.</li>
