### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m REALLY fair skinned!</li>
      <li>Great color for any skin tone.</li>
      <li>Still great though.</li>
      <li>The color looks GREAT, but I had to practically rub the compact itself on my face for the blush to show up----and</li>
      <li>Excellent product love it</li>
      <li>It is incredibly flattering as it always manages to capture the light.</li>
      <li>I love how this blush looks on me!</li>
      <li>From what I can tell, the color and texture would have been nice.</li>
      <li>It was a fair price, like most ELF</li>
      <li>I gave it the three stars because for the price it would&#x27;ve been a nice alternative to a highlighter and the color was a nice tan/pink color.</li>
      <li>you get lots of  build-able pigment that blends easily just like my mac for a fraction of the cost!</li>
      <li>a bit more sparkly than i wanted</li>
      <li>and I imagine it would make a really lovely eye shadow used this way.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok ...</li>
      <li>/&gt;I wouldnt consider this a blush-- its more if a shimmery highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but ELF could probably benefit for making more sturdy cases...</li>
      <li>I like it even better than Nars \\&quot;Orgasm\\&quot;</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a cute color</li>
      <li>Its just a perfect amount of shimmer on my cheek bones and for putting down the top of my nose...</li>
      <li>This is a pretty nice color.</li>
      <li>very easy to apply and has a pretty color.  </li>
      <li>and Im light skinned.</li>
      <li>Great Blush not to dark or light goes on smooth and silky not cakey at all!</li>
      <li>Love it when you first use it.</li>
      <li>The other stuff I&#x27;ve tried from this brand has been great.</li>
      <li>It blends over foundation very nicely, stays all day on my normal-to-oily skin and is pigmented just enough that I don&#x27;t ever look overly made up, even when I&#x27;ve rushed to get ready.</li>
      <li>I used this up real fast.  </li>
      <li>It can be hard to put on the brush but it a great product .</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Thank you, really pretty</li>
      <li>I love this blush as I can use it dry or wet... makes a nice difference.</li>
      <li>.. n fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>The color doesn&#x27;t show as much as I thought it might.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be able to use it much as I travel for a living and a shattered blush would make a mess.</li>
      <li>This color is a lovely pinky-brown that is slightly shimmery so if you&#x27;re looking for something matte</li>
      <li>I admit that I own at least a zillion blushes.</li>
      <li>It stays on well, but I usually reapply it mid-day just to get that pretty glow going strong again.</li>
      <li>It will give you that extra little pop of color and the famous \\&quot;glow\\&quot; without looking like a glitter ball.</li>
      <li>These are a steal and well worth a try if you have pale skin and want a little healthy color.</li>
      <li>This ELF blush ranks right up there with the far more expensive brands for staying power and beauty.</li>
      <li>The color is highly pigmented and looks like it will last forever.</li>
      <li>Nars, MAC, Bare Minerals, Smashbox, Milani.</li>

<li> not much goes on my brush..</li>
<li> only thing that bugs me is that every time I buy ELF products in these containers, the lid snaps off and breaks after a few uses.</li>
<li> Delivered on time,  but too subtle as I can barely see the shimmer.  </li>
<li> Mine arrived with a few other items shattered with blush powder all over everything inside the box.</li>
<li> which is a little too peachy for my skintone.</li>
<li> and I use it everyday for work.</li>
<li> The quality you get for the price is unbelievable</li>
<li> product is hard..</li>
<li> I like the ELF products, but quality of blushes really sucks...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a problem, I know, but there are worse things a girl could collect.</li>

    <li> Thank you, really pretty.. n fast shipping. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The color looks GREAT, but I had to practically rub the compact itself on my face for the blush to show up----and I&#x27;m REALLY fair skinned!</li>
    <li> I got the Passion Pink&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is hard.. not much goes on my brush.. i need to scrap it with my nails and loose up some flakes and then get it on my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt consider this a blush-- its more if a shimmery highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 5 because i dont mind using this as a highlighter and I use it everyday for work. Its just a perfect amount of shimmer on my cheek bones and for putting down the top of my nose...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love!</li>
    <li> The quality you get for the price is unbelievable you get lots of  build-able pigment that blends easily just like my mac for a fraction of the cost! E.l.f</li>
    <li> very easy to apply and has a pretty color.  a bit more sparkly than i wanted but it&#x27;s still a cute color</li>
    <li> I admit that I own at least a zillion blushes. Nars, MAC, Bare Minerals, Smashbox, Milani. You name it, I probably have it. It&#x27;s a problem, I know, but there are worse things a girl could collect. That said, this baked blush by Elf in the color \\&quot;Passion Pink\\&quot; is the one I reach for day after day. I like it even better than Nars \\&quot;Orgasm\\&quot; which is a little too peachy for my skintone. This ELF blush ranks right up there with the far more expensive brands for staying power and beauty. This color is a lovely pinky-brown that is slightly shimmery so if you&#x27;re looking for something matte this isn&#x27;t the shade for you. It will give you that extra little pop of color and the famous \\&quot;glow\\&quot; without looking like a glitter ball. It blends over foundation very nicely, stays all day on my normal-to-oily skin and is pigmented just enough that I don&#x27;t ever look overly made up, even when I&#x27;ve rushed to get ready. My skin is the palest shade of white, however, so if you have a darker skin tone this may not work for you or you may want to use it over a darker blush. I&#x27;ve heard you can apply these wet without ruining the blush and I imagine it would make a really lovely eye shadow used this way. These are a steal and well worth a try if you have pale skin and want a little healthy color.</li>
    <li> I gives me just the glow and amount of color that I want.  It stays on well, but I usually reapply it mid-day just to get that pretty glow going strong again.</li>
    <li> I like the ELF products, but quality of blushes really sucks... The other stuff I&#x27;ve tried from this brand has been great.</li>
    <li> Great Blush not to dark or light goes on smooth and silky not cakey at all! Lasts all day! Thanks! (:♥♥♥</li>
    <li> I love how this blush looks on me! It is incredibly flattering as it always manages to capture the light. I get compliments on it a lot. This is my second purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice color. It was a fair price, like most ELF products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that bugs me is that every time I buy ELF products in these containers, the lid snaps off and breaks after a few uses. Maybe that&#x27;s just me but ELF could probably benefit for making more sturdy cases...</li>
    <li> The color doesn&#x27;t show as much as I thought it might.</li>
    <li> I used this up real fast.  It was smaller than I thought is would be.  Still great though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok ... Takes ALOT to actually show up on my skin and Im light skinned. It&#x27;s shimmery, which I like.</li>
    <li> From what I can tell, the color and texture would have been nice. Mine arrived with a few other items shattered with blush powder all over everything inside the box. I won&#x27;t be able to use it much as I travel for a living and a shattered blush would make a mess. I gave it the three stars because for the price it would&#x27;ve been a nice alternative to a highlighter and the color was a nice tan/pink color.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time,  but too subtle as I can barely see the shimmer.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Great color for any skin tone. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product love it</li>
    <li> Love it when you first use it. It can be hard to put on the brush but it a great product .</li>
