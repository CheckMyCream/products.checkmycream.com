      <li>I heard good things about it from my friend, so I went to buy it.</li>
      <li>i read review after review with people exclaiming how good it is.</li>
      <li>So its great cause it does stay on all day with an easy way to take off at night (or whenever!)</li>
      <li>Finding the perfect mascara is almost like a life-long search for true love!</li>

      <li>/&gt;5) when in doubt, hot water&#x27;s your best friend!  </li>
      <li>this mascara was literally magical!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Fiberwig is like Magic!  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>First let me say that this is the BEST mascara I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>and i absolutely LOVE it!  </li>
      <li>Im in LOVE!</li>
      <li>WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this mascara!</li>
      <li>With everyone raving about this product, I figured it would be quite amazing.</li>
      <li>have tried it all -- Givenchy, Guerlain, Diorshow, NARS, Too Faced, Lancome, MAC, Sephora, Cover Girl, Maybelline, my own tears, bargaining, rage, acceptance.</li>
      <li>I really liked the idea of mascara that was waterproof but could still be removed with just water, instead of oily eye-makeup remover.</li>
      <li>I got it for Christmas and will never use another kind of mascara again.</li>
      <li>I actually own Diorshow</li>
      <li>So thrilled.</li>
      <li>Would&#x27;ve been nice if I could choose where the fibers end up being applied to my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn everything from Diorshow (which complements the Fiberwig nicely),</li>
      <li>Otherwise I still think this is a fair price for this must-have mascara :-)</li>
      <li>And thrilled.</li>
      <li>Warm water is all it takes to remove.  </li>
      <li>And here is one of my number one reasons for loving Fiberwig...</li>
      <li>I love love LOVE Imju Fiberwig!!</li>
      <li>Slides off easily with warm water!    </li>
      <li>/&gt;I also have VERY fine and light eyelashes, and I find this product gives me great length, colour, and definition.  </li>
      <li>Warm/hot water and soap is the most effective way of removing the mascara without damaging your own lashes.  </li>
      <li>I must say, it&#x27;s an easy removing good mascara.</li>
      <li>As I said, Lancome Hypnose is the best mascara I&#x27;ve used, and if you&#x27;re short on cash, Maybelline Volum Turbo boost is just as good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to wash off</li>
      <li>My top and bottom lashes kind of lock fibers every now and then.</li>
      <li>most amazing mascara.</li>
      <li>but it also is the most amazing lengthener I&#x27;ve ever used.    </li>
      <li>when I washed it off at the end of the night, it was sooooo easy to remove!</li>
      <li>love it love it LOVE IT!    </li>
      <li>It applies very smoothly and I had no issues with clumping.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t comment on how easy this stuff is to remove, but if it&#x27;s anything like the Too Faced fiber mascara, it just takes warm water and a washcloth.</li>
      <li>Easy to take off with warm water at the end of the day though I still use removers.</li>
      <li>But overall, this mascara has given me the best looking lashes EVER!</li>
      <li>I am sooo pleased.  </li>
      <li>After doing extensive research on the best mascara, fiberwigs name came up.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m now thinking my mascara&#x27;s were the cause for so many to appear in that area.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t clump AT ALL and lengthens more than any I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>I have been through so many kinds of mascara</li>
      <li>I love it and will recommend it to anyone.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ladies, I am one of you. I am one of the thousands, nay, millions of ladies that suffer from what refer to as \\&quot;lash envy\\&quot;. My sister has thick, long, naturally curled lashes. Angels sing when she applies mascara. And I weep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother has even longer, thicker and CURLIER lashes than my sister does. THIS CANNOT GO ON. This is genetic betrayal. This is unacceptable. This is my curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it all -- Givenchy, Guerlain, Diorshow, NARS, Too Faced, Lancome, MAC, Sephora, Cover Girl, Maybelline, my own tears, bargaining, rage, acceptance. I have spent over one million dollars on mascara. (This is an exaggeration.) None have worked out. I am the Larry King of mascara consumers. Enter Imuju Fiberwig. On a friend&#x27;s suggestion, I picked up a tube last night, and hoped for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLY MOLY. This stuff actually works. It does require a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Patience. (I do not possess much of this.)&lt;br /&gt;2. Multiple applications.&lt;br /&gt;3. Eyelashes. Not long ones, not thick ones. Just something to grab on to. (Sort of like \\&quot;hair in a can\\&quot;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on how easy this stuff is to remove, but if it&#x27;s anything like the Too Faced fiber mascara, it just takes warm water and a washcloth. (Once you realize that those tubey things are NOT your lashes coming off, and that you&#x27;re going to be referred to as \\&quot;ol&#x27; bald eyes\\&quot;, it gets a lot easier to remove.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold. And thrilled. So thrilled. I keep checking myself out in the mirror. It&#x27;s actually getting kind of disruptive. THIS MASCARA RULES.</li>
    <li> most amazing mascara. was a fan of lancome...but this is absolutely amazing...perfectly long separated lashes</li>
    <li> I have owned this for over a month and really like it. I wanted to love it but I don&#x27;t. I am blonde hair and light skinned, so I never leave without mascara. This mascara does NOT run (like racoon eyes after time). If that&#x27;s your problem you will LOVE this mascara. My problem was 1. it did flake after a few hours and hurt my eyes and 2. It will not hold with an eyelash curler. I need my eyelashes curled and whether I curled before or after it didn&#x27;t hold. This mascara is just too heavy. I would HIGHLY recommend for just putting it on for a night out but, not longer than that.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and it leaves my eyelashes looking clumped. It takes a lot of mascara to see &#x27;growth&#x27; but (aside from the unflattering look) the growth isn&#x27;t worth the unfinished/uneven look of my eyelashes. I did not find it worth the money.</li>
    <li> Finding the perfect mascara is almost like a life-long search for true love! I have been through so many kinds of mascara it makes my head spin. Every single one has left me with coon eyes sometimes after only 3 hours of wear! Well, NOT Fiberwig! I bought this mascara because my girlfriend, who is Japanese and the guru of all great makeup, suggested I try it.     First of all, let me tell you what I absolutely love about this mascara.    -NO COON EYES!!! I live in South FL and it is extremely muggy here. I can go all day, dancing at night, fall asleep with this stuff on and still no coon eyes.  -A little goes a long way. Just a few long sweeps and my lashes are super lengthened and ultra sleek. The brush seems to separate my lashes and rarely do I need to touch up with a lash brush.  -It is water-resistant and washes right off with warm water. I hate trying to get waterproof mascara off my lashes. It&#x27;s goopy when trying to remove and dries them out afterwards. After only a few weeks of using this product I noticed my lashes felt much less brittle and do not fall out nearly as often.  -Great for sensitive eyes. I don&#x27;t wear contacts, but my eyes tend to water with certain products. I have not experienced that at all with this mascara.    Overall, I don&#x27;t have many complaints about Fiberwig. It is a bit on the pricey side, but absolutely worth it. I love how natural this mascara makes my lashes look. If you are hoping this mascara will give you red carpet, Hollywood fake lashes, you may want to move on. It doesn&#x27;t seem to thicken/volumize as much as others but I will be using Fiberwig as my everyday mascara. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it out!</li>
    <li> It is my HG mascara since it really lengthens to nearly twice the length, and yes, no smudge all day long, the most you get is a bit of \\&quot;chipping\\&quot; if any at all. Easy to take off with warm water at the end of the day though I still use removers. However, not that easy as it will stay on all day.    Minor complaint about how fast it dries on your lashes - if you move too slow you might need to comb them to seperate later. Also I wish for a thickening formula as well.</li>
    <li> Great mascara. Does not flake or smudge. Stays on all day until you decide to take it off. Comes off easily with warm water and a little bit of pressure. Only mascara aside from Kiss Me that I do not have to SheLaq. THE BEST!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost one year.  I am one of the unfortunates who have ultra short, nearly invisible lashes without mascara, but raccoon eyes within a few hours of applying regular mascara, and I work 12 hours shifts!!!  So no mascara at work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought fiberwig and omg.  No panda eyes, no smears, no smudges, no problem taking it off when I want it off.  And best of all... EYELASHES !!!!!!!  Long, thick, noticeable lashes that last the entire 12 hours of my shift.  I come home from work, shower and off comes the fiberwig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS I travel to Florida 3-4 times a year, I just went in June, 90 degrees 90 percent humidity.. and the fiberwig didn&#x27;t budge until I wanted it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> I heard of Fiberwig just a couple of weeks ago.  I live in a country where we did not have this product until recently...I was of course skeptical.  Sometimes things that are this hyped are not what they claim to be...but I was curious and looking for a good mascara...so I bought some.  I was knocked out of my socks!  This is the COOLEST stuff ever.  I will buy again!  First of all, it lengthens lashes like nobody&#x27;s business!  It DOES look like fake lashes, and it is easy to apply and clump free.  It did not make my lashes straight...in fact I was asked if I used an eyelash curler!    This stuff is like MAGIC to take off.  Just a little warm water, tug and then, presto...no more mascara and best of all NO MESS!  I usually cannot stand mascara removal...it is a pain in the butt with all of the removers, black smears, ick ick ick!  But this stuff is MAGIC.  It is worth the cost just for the ease and speed of removal!    And here is one of my number one reasons for loving Fiberwig...it does NOT RUN!!!  I have the problem that my eyes begin to water every time I step outside...in the winter, the summer...and I am active, too.  I ride a bike to work, which renders most non-waterproof mascaras useless if I want to avoid raccoon rings.  This stuff is awesome though!  Fiberwig does NOT run!  I am sooo pleased.  In fact, tonight I ran 3 Kilometers in -6 degree (Celcius) weather, something that is sure to make any mascara run, but Fiberwig was still firmly on my lashes when I came back from my run...and not a smudge in sight!    The ONLY drawback is that I would like to see some more volume...other than that, I highly recommend!!  BUY IT...you will LOVE it.</li>
    <li> You know I was buying my second prder of this mascara when I had to stop and leave a review...    I ( like every woman) have been on the painstaking search to find the best mascara on the market. Little did I know it was in JAPAN lol This mascara goes on so easily, does not rub off, smear, flake, nor leave you with raccoon eyes at the end of the day. I know its been said before but its soo true! AND it lengthens enough to were you have great long lashes but not to were your over doing it for everyday wear.     My fav part about this mascara ( which is why I am now a lifelong fan ) is that I have really sensitive skin and most mascaras upon washing off or just wearing daily, irritate my skin &amp; eyes. Even using a makeup remover for most mascaras left me still seeing a shade of grey under my eyes, even after washing 2-3 times before bed. I hated this! But with fiber wig Oh! Im in LOVE! It comes off with just soap and water and leaves no residue.     I have also noticed a huge change in the black heads on my nose and in the middle of my eyebrows. This used to be the danger zone for so long and I&#x27;m now thinking my mascara&#x27;s were the cause for so many to appear in that area. Since I have been using Fiber Wig mascara this has changed drastically!!  That area, which was my problem area for so long, is now almost perfectly clear. :)    I can&#x27;t say it enough I love this mascara and I&#x27;m so happy to have come upon it. It&#x27;s perfect!     Now if you want a waterproof mascara this is not for you!</li>
    <li> I tend to try every mascara I can get my hands on. I like how this made my eyelashes look longer, but I prefer the fuller look.  Again, it was good...but not great considering the price tag attached to it.</li>
    <li> It seems that I am forever in search of the perfect mascara.  I used Maybelline Great Lash for years, and loved it, until within the last year.  It seems they changed the formula because it began to smear and leave dark marks under my eyes.  I then tried Blinc Kiss Me mascara. [[ASIN:B000UXVE98 Blinc Kiss Me Mascara Black 0.21oz]] That Mascara didn&#x27;t run, but became rather frustrating to remove each night. True to its word, it does form \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; on your eyelashes.  However, I would have to pull the \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; off every night which became time-consuming and worrysome that I would take my eyelashes with it.      Anyway, Fiberwig does work well.  No, it does not make my lashes (which are neither short not long) seem to lengthen nor does it seem to make my eyes &#x27;pop&#x27;.  It does not run, though, doesn&#x27;t clump, and stays in place all day. Nor does it bother my contacts.  It is easily removed with a gentle facial cleanser or with Lancome&#x27;s eye makeup remover. The brush is a bit large so I find myself having to open my eyes (which are faily large) fully to apply the mascara so I won&#x27;t poke myself in the eye.  My experience with this mascara, which I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 months, has not been bad, but it hasn&#x27;t been really great either.  Will I buy again? Don&#x27;t know at this point.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product, but I was really disappointed by the results. I did not notice a dramatic boost to the length of my lashes at all.  However, I did notice that it seemed to decrease the volume of my lashes- definitely not something I want from a mascara. Also, this stuff is not easy to remove! I had to use make-up remover, wash my face, use make-up remover again, AND I still had residue the next day. The formula forms little tubes around your eyelashes and while it does nothing for the appearance of the lashes, it is a pain to remove, literally.  I have used drugstore mascara that puts this one to shame.  I am going back to Loreal&#x27;s Double Extend- twice the length and volume at half the price.</li>
    <li> When it comes to make up, for me it&#x27;s all about the eyes and I like my lashes to be dramatic, as thick and long as possible without using falsies.  In truth, I&#x27;ve never found one mascara that does everything, so I layer different mascaras.  I use Dior Diorshow as my volumizing mascara and Imju Fiberwig as my lengthening mascara.  It&#x27;s amazing how much the lashes are extended with Fiberwig, but it doesn&#x27;t give me as much volume as I would like.  But the mascaras work great in combo.  I&#x27;ve had people ask me if I&#x27;m wearing falsies, and I proudly say no.    When going for a more natural look, nothing beats Fiberwig.  It separates each lash nicely, no clumping at all, and adds length.  I especially love it on my lower lashes because it doesn&#x27;t smudge and leave me with raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dior mascara for a long time and decided it was time to try something new. I went into Sephora and asked the sales woman what she would recommend that&#x27;s a bit similar. She showed me a few but Fiberwig caught my attention because I had heard of it before and the brush is nice and big like Dior&#x27;s. I decided to try it. I must say that it does make it look like I have more lashes than I had ever imagined. It separates all of them, even the tiny ones! It also sure does NOT come off!!! I have swam, showered, washed my face, cried, and sweat in this stuff (not all at the same time of course, haha) and it DID NOT come off!!! It&#x27;s even a bit difficult to get off. What I have found works well to get it off is to use warm to hot water and use a downward motion on your eyelashes so the \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; work their way off. I really like that about this mascara though. I used to look like I didn&#x27;t put on any makeup after work, now it&#x27;s still on! You also have to coat the bottom of the lashes (like you normally would) as well as doing the top of them. It&#x27;s kind of awkward at first but you&#x27;ll get better results. Takes me about three coats to get it just right.     Great product and would/will buy again! My only complaints are that they need to include an instruction booklet as well as make it so it adds more volume. It tends to straighten out my lashes so curling them is essential.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second day of using this mascara and I think it&#x27;s love. I wear contacts and this stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all! My lashes look so much longer and thicker and it doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge. Plus, it comes off easily with my makeup towelette at night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Word to the natural girls - this is not a mascara for you my nuetral, peach gloss loving friend. This is pumped-up, girly-girl, make-up faced stuff. If you&#x27;re in the mood for a little drama, try it. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m so happy that this product finally made its way here in the states. i was introduced to this particular brand a few years ago by a friend when i went to visit her in osaka, and i&#x27;ve been hooked since. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m one of those unfortunate few who for some reason or the other always end up with \\&quot;panda eyes\\&quot; at the end of the day due to mascara run-off. i&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap to expensive, and from regular to waterproof mascaras to no avail. somehow though, this mascara, because of the unique properties of the fibers will not smudge on the skin, no matter how humid or wet the day is. the cool thing about it is that if you rub your eyes the fiber will fall, but not stain the skin, thus eliminating the panda eye effect. the fibers will coat the eyelashes and dry up, forming a sort of tube around the lashes and are surprisingly easy to clean at the end of the day, no special solutions needed. when you clean your eyelashes you can actually see the fibers loosen up and leave your lashes without any residue. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i am also a contact lens wearer and this product, unlike many other mascaras, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and lasts practically forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;this has to be the best mascara i have used yet, and that is saying something. even the expensive department store and specialty mascaras pale next to this. and i even bought it at a local japanese drugstore! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;never leave home without it; it&#x27;s possibly the last mascara you&#x27;ll ever need!</li>
    <li> What a waste! Save your money unless of course you&#x27;re into black fibers falling off on to your cheeks. I don&#x27;t like a mascara I have to keep checking. The fibers also come off when I comb through my lashes with an eyelash comb to eliminate clumps. Would&#x27;ve been nice if I could choose where the fibers end up being applied to my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff reminds me of morning after mascara - you know, mascara you didn&#x27;t wash off the night before so it ends up looking clumpy with little fibers in it that look like you got fuzzies stuck in your mascara from your pillow case.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara about a week ago and I am almost in love.  I use to always get panda eyes with my mascara, regardless of how expensive or cheap the brand it, but with this mascara...NO MORE PANDA EYES!  However, it weighs my lashes down. I curl my lashes and then put it on, and then my lashes fall.  Afterwards I would have to curl my lashes again.  But since it doesn&#x27;t give me panda eyes, I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
    <li> I did not like this at first because I have long lashes and I was looking for a more of a volumizing mascara and this does not volumize at all... It does however, seperate and lengthen considerably. It gives a very pretty feathered doll eye look. I did not have problems with fallout or clumping but it is still fairly new. I&#x27;ve found that if you really take the time to curl your lashes well and put this on carefully you will get a very pretty look...but unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth anywhere near 20 dollars and I will not repurchase this as I&#x27;m sure that there are other mascaras that can do the same thing for much cheaper.    pros: It&#x27;s the best eyelash seperating mascara that i have ever used and the length is good.    cons: does not volumize and price is atrocious.</li>
    <li> Personally, I adore this mascara.  I am one of the many women who gets the dreaded \\&quot;panda eyes\\&quot; by the end of the day.  This is the FIRST mascara that I&#x27;ve tried that hasn&#x27;t melted, run, or smudged by the end of the day.  I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s perfect (it DOES tend to flake if you wear it all day/overnight/in a dry climate, but I can deal with the small amount of flaking if it&#x27;s in place of running), but it meets all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It comes off very easily with a small amount of warm water, which is nice because it means I don&#x27;t have to buy eye make-up remover just to avoid dark smudges after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have VERY fine and light eyelashes, and I find this product gives me great length, colour, and definition.  I LOVE this mascara and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hooked on this mascara since this product was first introduced in Asia. I&#x27;m already on my 6th one. I&#x27;m so glad Sephora has brought this wonderful product into the states. I no longer have to ask friends and family to bring me this product from overseas. I just wish Sephora carries this product for lower eye lashes as well.   I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different mascaras, from Estee Lauder to Dior, nothing worked as well as Fiberwig did. This mascara does not smudge or flake, cleans off easily, and it gives me the long lashes that I want. Microfiber is definitely the future of mascara.</li>
    <li> I tried it but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I need my lashes to look full and lush.   It has fibers and does add length</li>
    <li> Pro: elongates &amp; separates lashes&lt;br /&gt;Con: 1) Microfibers from the mascara itself fall INTO your eyes! One of my eyes was certainly not comfortable with those microfibers in it; 2) The mascara is too thin. Though it does separate your lashes, it does not give the illusion of more volume; 3) It&#x27;s hard to take off. Even with oil-based eye makeup remover or warm/hot water, It is REALLY hard to take the mascara off. On top of that, it strips off your natural lashes as it is so hard to remove. Because once the microfibers dry, they harden and your lashes become really stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Summary: What a disappointment. I even had my friend got it for me all the way from Tokyo and she told me that it&#x27;s all over in Japan. No one does not know Fiberwig and yet it&#x27;s a disaster. Out of all the mascaras I&#x27;ve tried, L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Double Extension is the best - even Dior can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Okay...I am a mascara ADDICT. I was on here looking for MORE mascara and remembered about 2 yrs ago when I tried the Imju Fiberwig mascara. It claims to be \\&quot;false eyelashes in a tube\\&quot;. Well I assure you that it is NOT. If you have ever seen that cheap dollar store nailpolish with those little colored slivers of confetti....well that is exactly like this mascara...its like little slivers of black confetti and you have to get it on your eyelashes JUST RIGHT because those slivers go sideways, and crooked and after a few hrs of wear they DO flake off everywhere. Things get stuck in your mascara, such as fuzz or your hair...because it always seems \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;...like it never dries... I have tried almost every brand of mascara that there is...from Lash Blast, to Diorshow, to Max Factor to Lancome Definicils....and I assure you the $10 Lash Blast volumized my lashes without clumping and each lash was separated....Im now trying the new YSL mascara with the unique wand....but as for the Fiberwig....its got fibers alright....and it is AWFUL. I do not recommend it at all....plus you have to literally roll it off of your lashes or pull it off...not attractive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mascara ADDICT, and was looking for something water resistant to use for the summer. I had never even heard of this product before but had decided to give it a try, and I am in love. It applies very smoothly and I had no issues with clumping. If anything, I would say it is almost TOO smooth, as I had to remove some spots from my eyelids after application. But, then again, I am clumsy. However, the spots came right off my skin using a damp qtip.    My first day wearing this mascara I spent my entire day out at an amusement park in 90 degree, humid weather. Even after walking around in that heat, getting a small rainstorm, and riding rollercoasters- I had no racoon eyes and my eyes looked perfect. Most astounding to me, was when I woke up in the morning after having not removed my eye makeup to find my mascara still perfectly intact. Despite the strong wear power, this product does remove easily with a makeup towelette. No hard rubbing needed.    All around great product!</li>
    <li> I believe this product would work for a person whose lashes are longer than mine.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle but I surely wasn&#x27;t expecting what I got for $22.  Not worth the money to me.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This mascara not only prevents raccoon eyes...but it also is the most amazing lengthener I&#x27;ve ever used.    First, I put on a thickening mascara, and then I put on as many layers of Fiberwig as necessary. There is no spidery, spiky ends. I wait for each layer to dry before putting on another, and there is still not a clump! Instead, my lashes look super fluttery and natural/wispy at the end.    CONS: It doesn&#x27;t thicken well, so don&#x27;t think this will give you the \\&quot;false lashes\\&quot; look it advertises. And it doesn&#x27;t hold curl as well as a typical waterproof mascara. Oh, and the brush is on the big side, unfortunately. In Japan, they have a smaller, more precise brush, but it hasn&#x27;t come to the States yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 2 days and i absolutely LOVE it!  I&#x27;ve been looking for a mascara for my short, stubby, thin lashes for the past 10 years. Now, finally, here&#x27;s a mascara that stands up to its claim! I&#x27;ve always been disappointed with the past 15 mascaras I&#x27;ve tried (i.e Diorshow, Benefit Badgal, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiberwig doesn&#x27;t volumize (which the product doesn&#x27;t claim to do) but it definitely lengthens and curls.  My lashes stayed curled for the whole day!  No other mascara has done this for me.  Absolutely no smudges and flakes.  Wipes away very easily with water and facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my lashes are so thin, other mascaras were usually so heavy that they never held a curl, but Fiberwig is incredibly light.  The formula doesn&#x27;t look liquidy, instead you see little black fibers which stick on to your lashes and on to themselves for the lengthening look.  I also think if you take the wand and start pushing up against (in a curling motion) your lashes from the bottom and wiggle the wand to the top of your lashes, it curls without a lash curler!  I think it&#x27;s because the fibers stick on to each other in the direction you apply the wand.  I feel like you have to wiggle the wand since it&#x27;s so BIG so that you don&#x27;t get clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if the wand was smaller (or came in various sizes) because my skinny, thin, stubs for lashes can&#x27;t really handle a gigantic wand.  I also hope that they create a formula that can also increase volume.  For volume, I&#x27;m going to try using my Mabelline Volume XXL mascara first then applying Fiberwig.  But overall, this mascara has given me the best looking lashes EVER!</li>
    <li> First let me say that this is the BEST mascara I have ever tried. WOW!&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I went to Houston Galleria and tried on Fiberwig vs. Diorshow. I went to different people in the store and asked them which one is better to them they said Fiberwig.And I agreed! Dont get me wrong Diorshow is good but Fiberwig oh me lookes like I have on Fake lashes. When using Fiberwig do the brush up and down on lashes NOT under, curl and out. Its not going to look right at all. Again when using Fiberwig you must go up and down on lashes with brush and my my my its fake lash time....which is so beautiful on me.....I wont go to another mascara. But remember Diorshow is good too but Fiberwig is so much better....</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few months ago and I love it.  I had previously used Benefit Bad Gal Lash.  This mascara gives a look similar to Bad Gal with coming off.  However, if you rub your eyes, the fibers will come off.  The mascara does not come off with just water, but rinses off very easily with your normal facial cleanser and water.  After reading some of the bad reviews of Imju here, it is perhaps not the best product for those with sparse/thin eyelashes.  I already have thicker, longer eyelashes so this mascara is great enhancer.</li>
    <li> Fiberwig is a great mascara if you&#x27;re looking for a subtle enhancer for a day-time look. It adds length and accentuates naturally without clumping or smearing.    If only it weren&#x27;t for the flaking! By noon at work, this stuff starts flaking into my eyes and on my cheeks. My top and bottom lashes kind of lock fibers every now and then. It&#x27;s enough of an annoyance to warrant knocking it down two stars. That&#x27;s such a shame considering how much I enjoy how Fiberwig looks on me.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works to lengthen lashes, but I have to use several coats, it doesn&#x27;t define, and I end up with clumps and smears. Also, don&#x27;t get it in your eye, as all those little fibers are a pain to get out and usually end up ruining your eye&#x27;s health for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend Bad Gal Lash instead.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara! It looks great, it doesn&#x27;t run, and you don&#x27;t need make-up remover to take it off! Just warm water and face wash always does the trick!</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara about a month ago, and am hooked.  For me, it did not make my eyelashes necessarily look longer (I have very long eyelashes already), but it&#x27;s not AT ALL clumpy, goes on really nice and evenly, does not smudge or end up under your eyes by the end of the day, and it comes off very easily.  I love it.  Mascara is my number one make-up item, always am looking for good mascaras.  Lancome was my choice before, but now I like this.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000MA3ZHI Imju Fiberwig Fiberwig Mascara]] I love this product. It is replacing my false eyelashes. Stayed on over 12 hours with no smudging. I used 3 coats and my wimpy lashes skyrocketed. Wait about a minute between coats to allow the product to dry. This is the bomb.</li>
    <li> This mascara is unlike any others for the following reasons: (1) It goes on light and you don&#x27;t have that heaviness that you tend to have with drugstore brands (2) It isn&#x27;t clumpy (3) It stays on your lashes and isn&#x27;t running under your eyes by mid-afternoon like most mascaras. I put this on at 7am and don&#x27;t take it off until after 7pm (which includes working out at the gym) and still no racoon eyes. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have short small and very curled eyelashes, so when I started to hear and see reviews on this product I had to try it.  So far so good...I have only tried it on one eye which is my worst eye because the lashes are uneven and some stick out more than the others. I put on 3 coats but starting noticing the effects after the second coat.  It does work better than any other mascara on the market, which includes all lancome, dior, covergirl, chanel, victorias secret estee lauder just to name a few.  Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> I heard good things about it from my friend, so I went to buy it. The first time i used it i was like \\&quot;OMG!\\&quot; because after all these time there was finally a mascara that made my lashes noticebly longer while the use of mascara remained unnoticeble. I love it and will recommend it to anyone.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Last note, if you have Japanese friends, ask them to get it for you in Japan. It&#x27;s much cheaper! Otherwise I still think this is a fair price for this must-have mascara :-)</li>
    <li> After doing extensive research on the best mascara, fiberwigs name came up. i read review after review with people exclaiming how good it is. Unfortunately after receiving the product and using it, I realized that it does absolutely nothing for me. I will say that when used in combination with other mascaras, it may add a little something, but overall it&#x27;s not work the time or the money.</li>
    <li> I saw the fiberwig on sephora&#x27;s top rated mascara links, so i was all excited and bought it from the store. After several days of trying out the product, i was a bit disappointed. Fiberwig does extend and separate the lashes but it doesn&#x27;t thicken at all. So i combined it with Diorshow or Definicils, the result is much better.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE Imju Fiberwig!! I got it for Christmas and will never use another kind of mascara again. I have average length eyelashes and up until now have been using Lancome Definicils (which is a great mascara too). A few times now I have showed my family and friends my lashes before putting on Fiberwig and after and they are amazed also! I am a beauty product junkie and this stuff has really impressed me. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a total cheap skate about make up and hate spending this much for mascara, but it really is worth every penny.  Once applied, it gives very similar results to Loreal Voluminous (my previous favorite.) However, Fiberwig really lasts.  Most mascaras shrink up and flake or smudge during the course of the day, but this one does not.  It looks freshly applied the whole time it is on your lashes - you will not need to add more in the evening before you go out to dinner, ending up with &#x27;tarantula lashes.&#x27;  And, yes, it truly does wash off with soap and water, causing no long-term damage to your lashes.  It&#x27;s really great!</li>
    <li> I like this because it is,    1. Clump-free!    2. No more raccoon eyes!    3. Slides off easily with warm water!    4. Make eyelashes long &amp; increase!      The more you use the mascara(for every it use), the longer your lashes become. (At first, you might not feel the effect because brand-new one is too moist, I think.)    dejavu fiberwig mascara is essential for me!</li>
    <li> this is the best mascara around!  I love it. It is clump free,  creates long feathered lashes, its like an in-between to fake lashes and mascara, some ingredient in it almost freezes the mascara inbetween your lashes to give you a thicker, fuller, longer look.  It is completely clumpfree, and when you do wash it off, it does not smudge around your eyes turning makup removing into a whole new task.  It actually just comes off in a dry swoop!  Basically this product is the best of its kind.  I was one of the lucky ones that go to try it before it hit the US market, and I haven&#x27;t been able revert to anything else since.  I will still use other mascaras, but wen I want a more dramatic finish for an evening out, this is my go to mascara for sure!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about a week now, and I have to say: love it love it LOVE IT!    I was skeptical at first - mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake or go all over the place?  yeah, right.  I&#x27;m a contact lens wearer and I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of supposedly long-lasting, waterproof, smudge-proof, flake-proof mascaras without any of them actually living up to the hype - but now I&#x27;m sold.  Not only does this stuff stay on all day - and if any of it does flake off, it&#x27;s a tiny bit and it&#x27;s the dry tubules of product which brush right off of the skin with no trouble - but even on a blonde like me, it looks pretty natural.  No clumps, no sticky lashes, no stiffness, just an extra growth of lash length, definition, and thickness with each swipe of the wand.  And it doesn&#x27;t smudge!  Even with my dry, sensitive, blinky, contact-lens-wearing eyes, and even with the summer heat, this stuff stays put.  Now, I just hope that it keeps getting produced and imported for all eternity, so I never have to go back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot; mascaras again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for more than a week.  I love it because: 1) I don&#x27;t get the panda eyes even after a full day or after being teary-eyed. (long lasting &gt;8 hours) 2) It&#x27;s very easy to wash off so there&#x27;s no harsh wiping of delicate skin around the eyes 3)my lashes which are short where double the thickness and at least double the length giving it a more dramatic look -- no, not movie star false lashes but enough to make my lashes look long and full.    I do curl my lashes after putting on the mascara and that does work for me.  The curl stays on all day.  I like that I don&#x27;t have to keep checking my makeup because the mascara does stay put.    For an overall long wear, I also use cake eyeliner and both the mascara and the liner stays put.</li>
    <li> Imju Fiberwig is pretty decent mascara if only for how well it stays on. It does stay on all day and comes off very easily with just some warm water and a little tugging, actually it can be sort of fun to take it off(in a rub glue on your hands and peel it off sort of way).   It did give me longer lashes, although I found it to make my lashes a bit too stiff for my liking and I would rather length and thickness in one, and it sort of lacks in giving thickness and volume.  The result is long but hard and crusty lashes with little to no fluffy volume and that&#x27;s not really what I&#x27;m looking for in a mascara, I prefer mascaras like Benefit&#x27;s BadGal, Diorshow, and even Cover Girl&#x27;s Lash Blast mascara.   So its great cause it does stay on all day with an easy way to take off at night (or whenever!) but I would rather a mascara that gave me softer lashes even if there is some smudgeing to put up with.</li>
    <li> This is such a great mascara! my lashes look longer and it is easily removable just use water.</li>
    <li> This mascara really delivers on its promise of added length, albeit not \\&quot;false-lash\\&quot; length.  If you usually apply several coats of mascara, and do not mind your lashes a little clumpy and sticking together, you may love the length you get from Fiberwig.    After much experimenting, I have found an application method that makes this mascara look as natural as possible.  First, its best to have a lashcomb available, especially a metal-teeth one, like Tweezerman&#x27;s \\&quot;Folding iLashcomb\\&quot;.  After your first application of the mascara, comb through the lashes from base to tip several times, until all clumps are gone and the lashes are properly separated.  Let dry.  Apply several more coats - just to the tips of the lashes - letting dry between each coat.  You may want to comb out the tips a little each time; sometimes the fibers go on sideways. Warm/hot water and soap is the most effective way of removing the mascara without damaging your own lashes.  Its not waterproof, but it stays on like it is.    You will get some serious length from Fiberwig - my lashes brush the insides of my glasses when I&#x27;m wearing this!  However, the trade-off is that they are stiff, more clumpy than with regular mascara, and sometimes they even stick together top-to-bottom when you blink or close your eyes.  Overall, it looks like you&#x27;re wearing too much mascara, and its not cheap.  If you want long lashes for a special occasion or evening out (darkened lighting) than this will deliver.  If you are hoping for a daily mascara that gives long, soft, beautiful lashes that look like they are naturally yours, keep looking.   Good luck!</li>
    <li> If you have ever tried Shu Uemura&#x27;s Fiber Xtension Lengthening Mascara, this is the same thing. Like S.U., this mascara is good at seperating the lashes, coating each strand with just the right amount of mascara fluid, and creating a natural look. You don&#x27;t need a eyelash comb when using this because the formula is thin. The huge brush head is similar to Dior&#x27;s Diorshow mascara - minus the clumpy formula. I bought this on Ebay and I expected so much, being that it is a Japanese product (and their country is 2nd after the US in consuming makeup products).    The mascara is great for everyday wear, it doesn&#x27;t smudge, nor does it irritate my skin or eyes (I wear contacts, and have dry, sensitive skin). But it does not provide the glamorous look that I desire. I don&#x27;t have long or thick eyelashes, so I need that one product that will really open up my eyes.     I&#x27;m still on the prowl for the perfect mascara. I&#x27;ve tried Lancome, Shiseido, YSL, Shu Uemura, Maybelline, Covergirl, Dior, Armani, and now Fiberwig. Next up: Fresh brand&#x27;s Supernova mascara.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the first several times I used it was not happy as it added length but not volume, and as other people stated it would not hold a curl.  So I tried curling my lashes as normal, putting on my regular mascara on just the base of my lashes and finishing off with the Imju on the tips of my lashes.  It worked!  You may want to try several coats of both to get the best results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Asian girl with medium-long eyelashes that are stick straight and thin. I bought this thinking that Asians know how to make cosmetics for Asians and I also heard what a big hit this was in Japan. I&#x27;m always very wary about reviews on American products because mostly Caucasian women with very different eyelashes than I do are buying these products.    This definitely added some length, but my eyelashes were still really thin and stick straight. I&#x27;d curl my eyelashes and then put the mascara on and it&#x27;d uncurl my eyelashes right away. It works fine if I do mascara first and then curl, but the curl still doesn&#x27;t hold as well. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.    HOWEVER: I&#x27;ve heard that people will use Imju with Dior&#x27;s Diorshow mascara, combining Dior&#x27;s volume with Imju&#x27;s length. I actually own Diorshow so I tried that too, but it still doesn&#x27;t hold curl.    I currently use L&#x27;Oreal Shocking Volume Mascara and it holds curl, adds tons of volume and length. I&#x27;ve already have two friends run out and buy it after seeing it on me!</li>
    <li> The reviews for this product are confusing and vary between extremes.  Here&#x27;s a simple breakdown:    PROS:    lengthens  lashes look natural  does not smudge at all  easy to remove  perfect for lower lashes    CONS:    lashes don&#x27;t hold curl  does not deliver a dramatic look  clumps if you use too much    Synopsis:  This mascara is perfect for lower lashes because it does not rub off.  It is a nice everyday mascara on my upper lashes.  For a \\&quot;night look\\&quot; I use Volume Express and put this on top.  It prevents the regular mascara from flaking off and smudging.  I really like this mascara because I&#x27;ve never been able to wear anything on my lower lashes without things turning into smudge-city by noon.  It&#x27;s worth owning.</li>
    <li> I think the reason this product is so controversil is because not everyone know how to use it.  To really get it to work, there are certain things you MUST do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) apply multiple coats, and apply it both from above and below your top lashes.  This is because you&#x27;re coating your lashes with fibers, and to do that you have to coat it from both directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) if you want more length, wait until your first/second coat dries, then apply more coats.  if you don&#x27;t wait until it dries, passing the brush through your lashes will just remove some of the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) because of the nature of this thing, it actually uncurl your eyelashes.  This is one of the few products where you have to curl AFTER applying it.  Wait until it is COMPLETELY DRY, then use your curler and GENTLY curl it.  you probably don&#x27;t need to curl too much because it makes your lashes so long, slight curl is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) it IS difficult to remove with cold water.  For easiest removal, wash with warm/hot water (if you use non-waterproof liner and other eyemakeup, then perfect).  It DOES come off with regular eyemakeup remover, but it takes a bit of scrubbing, which is a bit annoying.  on the other hand, be glad it won&#x27;t come off even if you get rained on.  :D  On the other hand, it might come off a little if you cry, since tears are warm.  ^^;;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) when in doubt, hot water&#x27;s your best friend!  Please remember that the best way to remove this is with warm/hot water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that said, this thing seriously lengthens, as long as you use it properly.  Redip your brush often, and wait for it to dry a bit between each application, to allow for major lengthening.  It doesn&#x27;t add much for volume, but i think the length totally makes up for that...at least for me.  a bit difficult to remove though, so I usually use this when i know i got a long day ahead of me.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a fantastic product.  :D</li>
    <li> I really liked the idea of mascara that was waterproof but could still be removed with just water, instead of oily eye-makeup remover. I first tried Blinc&#x27;s Kiss Me mascara, which I LOVED. However, Kiss Me didn&#x27;t give me quite the thickness I wanted, so I decided to give Fiberwig a try. While Fiberwig definitely gets my lashes thicker than Kiss Me, it also is prone to tiny flakes if you wear it all day in high humidity, and it is thicker and clumpy in the tube -- much harder to apply neatly. The brush is big and unwieldy, especially for the smaller inner and lower lashes. Overall, it gives me good length, thickness and definition, but I think when I run out I&#x27;ll be going back to Kiss Me.</li>
    <li> this is a great mascara. i usually have raccoon eyes by the time i get home from work, but this mascara stayed put! i worked some days 12 hours and fall a sleep with out washing my face.And I still look good in the morning.the only strange thing about this mascara is the way it comes off, you pull it off. it&#x27;s a strange stringy consistency when i remove it. it&#x27;s unlike any mascara that i&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara.  I just took off lash extensions, and was pleased to see my lashes remaining in good condition...but disappointed all over again with their short length (ie: around 1/4 inch &amp; straight/no real curl/flip on the end.)  Anyway...I read about this mascara, Fiberwig.  I decided to try it, along with 2 others that made similar claims: Kevyn Aucoin, and Shu Uemura X-Tension.  Turns out they all appear to be exactly the same thing...only Fiberwig&#x27;s brush is the BEST of the 3.  Aucoin&#x27;s is very skinny, which separates the lashes GREAT but does little in the way of length building.  And Uemura&#x27;s is just mediocre...somehow once it&#x27;s on it doesn&#x27;t look any different than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever worn...very underwhelming.  Meanwhile...Fiberwig is like Magic!  My lashes are over 1/2 \\&quot; long using this mascara &amp; brush.  Any product that can make your lashes x2 their normal length has ME hooked for life.  One little tip for all you Amazon loyalists...I did personally purchase mine on Sephora dot com, and it was $7 less than the price listed here.  GET IT!!  Shortie lash girls...it will change your whole outlook!  It&#x27;s all the benefits of false lashes without the hassle, and all the beauty of extensions for a fraction of the cost.  Do not delay...order today!  :)</li>
    <li> This mascara is such a letdown! I am a devotee of Lancome Hypnose, but I wanted to see what else is out there.     As someone who works in marketing, I am disappointed that Fiberwig does not live up to its brand promise- where are my \\&quot;painted on false lashes\\&quot;? The formula is thin, and does give the definition of false lashes, but that&#x27;s about it. I have relatively thin lashes, and I like much more volume than Fiberwig can offer. In addition, the lengthening aspect was just not there.    Also, it definitely didn&#x27;t come off with warm water only. Even after a few swipes of makeup remover, I had a couple flakes left over.    I guess the only reason I gave it one star was because it... functions as mascara? I would only recommend it if you have thick lashes and just want a bit more color, without any clumping.    As I said, Lancome Hypnose is the best mascara I&#x27;ve used, and if you&#x27;re short on cash, Maybelline Volum Turbo boost is just as good.</li>
    <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY. THIS MASCARA IS OVERRATED. MAYBELLINE XXL OR COLOSSAL DO A MUCH BETTER JOB AND COST ALOT LESS MONEY. THIS MASCARA DID NOT MAKE MY LASHES LOOK LONGER OR THICKER, IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY AND WAS DIFFICULT TO REMOVE.</li>
    <li> I have very short straight lashes. Ive bought sooo many mascaras trying to find the perfect one that will lenghten them withougt luck. I finally found this one and it works like magic! It add lenght, volume, doesnt smudge, and stay on all day! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It flakes alot, and every where. Within a couple of hours i had black fibers all over my cheeks. I had high hopes for this mascara but it went back the next day. Look around there are better products out there.</li>
    <li> It is amazing! I didn&#x27;t believe it at first until my friend showed me how to use it. I cannot believe how it stays on all day. Completely accentuates and lengthens my lashes. I curled them first and then applied Fiberwig, my lashes were up the entire day, they never came down. Probably because of how light it is, it is not heavy at all. My lashes look totally natural...and the best part...when I washed it off at the end of the night, it was sooooo easy to remove! It never smudged...not during the day or even after I washed them off. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> this mascara was literally magical! &lt;br /&gt;i love it!! it made my lashes 3 times as long!! &lt;br /&gt;but be warned when u wash it off, little hairs come off with it and NO its not your eyelashes, they are little micro hairs</li>
    <li> This product is FANTASTIC if you know what to expect.  Fiberwig is a type of \\&quot;tubing\\&quot; mascara, which differs from standard mascaras in that it forms little \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; around your eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim that it creates the look of false eyelashes is misleading.  The beauty in wearing falsies is usually from the fact that the quantity of eyelashes you have are doubled, or more.  What Fiberwig does is different.  They have the tubing mascara formula, but add additional \\&quot;fibers\\&quot; that build on each other and just keep on lengthening your lashes (this is key, because you must re-dip your wand when you see a lack of fibers on the wand). The result is long, dark lashes that don&#x27;t smudge at all, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a contact lense wearer, and half asian (so my lashes are long, but not thick), I am ridiculously pleased with this product.  No irritation, no smudging, just hot lashes. I&#x27;ve done so much mascara research within the past 2 years on all kinds of forums.  I&#x27;ve worn everything from Diorshow (which complements the Fiberwig nicely), Lancome&#x27;s Deficils, and every new mascara to hit the drug stores.  This product looks so very natural on me and gives my eyes a dolly look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some hints:&lt;br /&gt;1. Curl eyelashes BEFORE (duh).&lt;br /&gt;2. Redip your wand if you see there are no fibers on it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Move the wand kind of up and down your lashes.  Remember, you are \\&quot;building a bridge\\&quot; so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;4. Comb only while wet.&lt;br /&gt;5. NEVER do a second coat or else, yeah, you&#x27;ll get spider lashes.&lt;br /&gt;6. Look on YouTube for Ford Model Elena Wang giving eye makeup tips for asians.  She uses both Fiberwig (length) and Diorshow (volume).  I&#x27;ve tried this myself and oh my, it&#x27;s quite over the top.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried! I&#x27;ve tried expensive, I&#x27;ve tried grocery store-- they are all the same. They all clump and never lengthen. This doesn&#x27;t clump AT ALL and lengthens more than any I&#x27;ve ever tried. I wouldn&#x27;t say it makes me look like I have false eyelashes, by any means, but it certainly makes my lashes look fuller and longer. It comes off easily too. It will start to flake off by the end of the day, especially if you rub your eyes. But, all makeup only has a good lifetime of 6-8 hours anyway. Give it a try!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Imju for close to a year now and love it for everyday use. As many have said, it&#x27;s a lengthening mascara only--don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re looking for volume.  Unlike others here, I have not had a problem with lashes holding their curl after applying this mascara.  So it holds the curl, seriously lengthens, never gives racoon eyes, and stays on and in place until you take it off (even when you sleep in it). Never have any issues with clumping. Warm water is all it takes to remove.  Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for length and a clean look.</li>
    <li> I bought this in Japan and am so happy it is available now in the States! I was hoarding my extra tubes for a while.  I also have the smaller brush for corner lashes, but I don&#x27;t think that is available in the US yet.     If you are familiar with Kiss Me/Blinc mascara (also from Japan) Cargo&#x27;s Texas Lash, or Lancome&#x27;s now defunct Magicils, you will understand this product better.      I have very oily skin and any other type of mascara ends up in my skin by the end of the day.  I mean \\&quot;in\\&quot; not \\&quot;on,\\&quot; as in stuck inside my pores and won&#x27;t come out even with intense scrubbing, water proof make-up remover or anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  It takes three days for regular mascara to wind its way out of my skin.    So if this is your problem too, this mascara is you answer!</li>
    <li> It is pretty good, yet it doesn&#x27;t fully come off with just water as it claims. Also, It depends first on what kind of lashes you have. If you dont have that many lashes/have thin ones this will just make your lashes look like a couple a very long but it will look like you only have 5 individual lashes. For long lashes, it does not clump which is great. It really does not smear or shed!!!! Overall four stars. I&#x27;m looking for even longer length.</li>
    <li> With everyone raving about this product, I figured it would be quite amazing. Immediately when you open it you notice it doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as other mascaras. Whenever I applied it I found that if I rolled it through my eyelashes like I&#x27;d roll a round brush through my hair, it coated them all and made them look thicker. However, it doesn&#x27;t lengthen. If you do get fibers on the tips of your lashes it looks more like black cobwebs than false lashes or addition to your length. Clumps are very rare but they do happen--and when they do it&#x27;s hard to remove since the fibers adhere to your lashes. The stay ability is unsurpassed--it&#x27;s been with me for over 16 hours now and looks as if I just put it on. I feel I have to give this product 3 stars because if you&#x27;re expecting some miracle it&#x27;s not going to happen. A previous review said that if your lashes were longer it would perhaps work for you. Well my lashes are long and it didn&#x27;t do anything more with the length. So short lashed and long lashed people alike should not buy into the hype too much or you could feel let down. I must say, it&#x27;s an easy removing good mascara. I would probably buy it again if I ran out. There are many benefits that outweigh the drawbacks but the drawbacks amount to false advertisement.</li>
    <li> I received the Imju Fiberwig yesterday and was surprised that the mascara is so gooey, makes lashes clump together and flakes off. My CVS mascara is much better. The plastic wrap on the Sephora package was slit, so maybe I was sent a product that had been returned and was old. If this is the case, I am still disappointed with Sephora.    This was my first purchase from Sephora and will be my last.      Jan from Titusville</li>
    <li> I loved how the mascara coated my lashes without the dreaded tarantula look. It lasted all day without flaking off or running. Try it, seriously you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> I recently received my order and must say that I am very dissappointed in this product.  I was hoping that it would make my lashes look fuller and longer but instead it has made them look very thin and drab. I have had better results from Maybeline products.  Very costly and doesn&#x27;t come through as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have short lashes and I have been on a pilgrimage of sorts to find something that makes them look longer.  On the plus, with several coats my lashes did seem longer.  Also, not smudging is great.  On the negative, my lashes clumped together and felt \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;.  I actually felt my eyes were tired at the end of the day wearing this.  I couldn&#x27;t seperate them well enough and felt like I looked like Tammy Faye Baker (RIP).  I give three stars for length and non smudging.</li>
    <li> I have spent more and I have spent less for mascaras.  Most of the expensive ones did not do what they claimed.  FIBERWIG is the exception.  This mascara really gives me incredible length and the best definition and separation of any mascara I have tried, and I am over the hill and down the bend! lol The mascara has NEVER clumped on me no matter how many coats I apply and I have such unruly lashes.  I am a contact lens wearer and wear this without incident.  It does not smudge at all!  Did I say I get incredible length!?  Of all of the lengthening mascaras I have tried, the fibers in this is what makes this product shine.  For me, the trick is to pick up as many fibers as I can and when I apply the product, twirl the brush at the ends of the lashes for superior separation and length.  I am telling you, this method really gives me sensational lashes.      UPDATE 11/11/2009:  As I found my mascara to be drying out, I added a view drops of water to it (you can use saline solution as well) and I AM TELLING MY... by doing this, I have more than double the length of my eyelases. EVEN MY HUSBAND OF 20 YEARS NOTICED.  He thought they were fake lashes!  WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?!  Just ordered my second tube!</li>
